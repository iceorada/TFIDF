<LD>Resplendent in sport coat, tie and black high-top sneakers, David
Ulin eyed his new surroundings and found them pleasing, but strange.
The Picassos on the living-room wall. The outdoor bar beside the lap
pool. The well-attired guests spearing plump sauteed shrimp off
passing platters.</LD>
<LD>   It was all so elegant, so Hollywood Hills, so unlike the back room
of his house where Ulin spent months getting paid "to sit on my
[derriere]," he joked, pulling together the literary anthology
"Writing Los Angeles."</LD>
<LD>   Hosted by Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer A. Scott Berg
("Lindbergh") and his partner, Kevin McCormick, executive
vice-president of production at Warner Bros. Films, the Tuesday
soiree had two purposes: to celebrate the book's publication and to
serve as a coming-out party for the idea that durable writing can
emerge from a city founded on ephemera.</LD>
<TE>   The crowd of 150, an artfully chosen miscellany of socialites,
screenwriters, novelists, Industry VIPs, literary agents and a
trust-fund baby or two, mixed easily, though not without a sense of
"What-am-I-doing-here?" among some of the writers. "It's not our
usual milieu," said Ulin, savoring the experience. "If this were just
us, we'd be drinking Ripple out of paper bags," said Bernard Cooper,
whose work is included in the new collection.</TE>
<TE>   Conceived by the prestigious Library of America and dedicated to
the proposition that local belles-lettres have come a long way since
Helen Hunt Jackson's "Ramona," "Writing Los Angeles" assembles the
work of more than 70 fiction authors, poets, essayists, diarists and
journalists, from the caustic (Bertolt Brecht) to the sensual (M.F.K.
Fisher) to the urban-apocalyptic (you pick 'em).</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Hurley, president of the Library of America, said that
after issuing an anthology of New York writing a few years ago, the
nonprofit publisher decided to take on L.A. Best known for its
handsome editions of the American literary canon, the organization is
eager to make marketing inroads in Southern California where, Hurley
told the attendees, "there's not enough people who know about the
Library of America."</TE>
<TE>   Hurley's colleague, Library of America publisher Max Rudin,
agreed, but thought that the situation could change. "This is the
most Hollywood party we've ever been to," he said, positioning
himself between the staircase and a grand piano. "Hopefully we'll
have some more friends out here. Scott is our secret weapon on the
West Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Berg, who serves on the Library's board of directors, said that
most outsiders think of L.A. as a movie, not a literary, town. "I
think with this book people are going to start to get it."</TE>
<TE>   A few feet away, Linda Bruckheimer, a bestselling novelist
("Dreaming Southern"), said she hadn't had a chance to peruse
"Writing L.A." but was looking forward to it. "I'm always interested
in how writers see Los Angeles because it's not an easy city to
categorize," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Which writer had come closest to capturing it, she was asked?
"Joan Didion," Bruckheimer said without hesitation. "She gets that
time and place of Los Angeles. It gives me goose bumps," she said.
"Her use of words is phenomenal," added her husband, Hollywood
mega-producer Jerry Bruckheimer.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the party was the type of finely considered anomaly that
might've sprung from Didion's own pen. "It's sort of a meeting of the
minds," said Robert Kovacik, West Coast correspondent for the
National Geographic Channel. "It's rare to see a meeting of the minds
in Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   "There are so few of them," put in Lynne Giler, a National
Geographic TV producer.</TE>
<TE>   As the city's lights blazed below the hills, and the catering crew
plucked empty glasses and rumpled cocktail napkins, it appeared that
L.A.'s men and women of letters were adjusting to their new milieu
just fine.</TE>

<LD>Congratulations must be pouring into record executive Clive Davis'
office after two of "his" albums entered the Top 5 of the national
sales chart Wednesday: Santana's "Shaman" and Rod Stewart's "It Had
to Be You ... The Great American Songbook."</LD>
<LD>   As head of Arista Records in 1999, Davis helped Carlos Santana
orchestrate the smash album "Supernatural." Davis has since moved on
to form J Records, but he still worked as co-producer on the new
album, which entered the chart at No. 1 by selling 299,000 copies.</LD>
<LD>   At J, Davis signed Stewart and encouraged the rock singer's idea
of recording pop standards. The CD sold 115,000 copies last week to
finish No. 4 on the chart. The only other newcomer in the Top 10 was
the Foo Fighters' "One by One," which finished No. 3 after selling
122,000 copies.</LD>
<TE>   Retailers expect Eminem's "8 Mile" to be No. 1 next week, possibly
selling 700,000 copies or more.</TE>

<HD>Low-tech, still Super</HD>
<DH>One music video director's enthusiasm results in a festival
of Super 8 filmmaking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew John Ignatius Vontz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greek artists found their divine inspiration in the muses. Norwood
Cheek, 35, of Silver Lake drew inspiration for his filmmaking career
from a less ethereal source: a remake of "Rocky" his cousin shot on
Super 8 that he saw when he was 15. To view the film, Cheek and his
extended family crowded into a basement and watched as the
neighborhood kid playing Rocky chugged a giant glass of raw eggs
before pummeling his opponent in a makeshift backyard boxing ring.</LD>
<LD>   "It was the first time I'd ever seen somebody that was my age make
something that wasn't a home movie," Cheek says. "All I talked about
from that point on was that I wanted a Super 8 camera."</LD>
<LD>   He got a camera for Christmas that year and from those low-tech
beginnings went on to build a successful career as a music video
director. Of the more than 60 videos he has directed for bands such
as Superchunk, Ben Folds Five and Soul Coughing, more than half have
been shot on Super 8.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Cheek, director of the Los Angeles Flicker Film
Festival, will bring the second annual installment of Flicker's
Attack of the 50 Foot Reels event to the Egyptian in Hollywood. Each
of the featured films has been shot on a single 50-foot reel of Super
8 that was edited in-camera, then handed over to Flicker for
processing. The screening will be the first time anyone will see the
finished films, including the filmmakers, who were selected on a
first-come, first-served basis.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Cheek started the Flicker festival in Chapel Hill, N.C.,
a bimonthly event that showcased short films shot on Super 8 and 16
millimeter. In addition to showcasing the work of aspiring
filmmakers, Cheek hoped to promote Super 8 filmmaking and encourage
people to discover the simple joys of shooting on it -- such as
easy-to-use thrift store cameras, in-camera editing, and the lack of
a need for lighting or film crews. Plus, the films are easy to
project.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Cheek moved to L.A. and brought the Flicker festival to
Spaceland in Silver Lake, where it has taken place more or less
bimonthly ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, a film student Cheek schooled in Super 8 in North
Carolina held a Super 8-only event and billed it the Attack of the 50
Foot Reels. A second, spinoff festival was born.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Wagganer is a past Flicker participant whose work will
appear in the upcoming Attack. "I was one of those teenagers who shot
Super 8 movies in high school, and I'd kind of lost touch with that
as I got into video in my late teens and 20s," he says. "I'd kind of
forgotten about Super 8 until I met Norwood and learned about
Flicker."</TE>
<TE>   Cheek gives away rolls of Super 8 film to the filmmakers at every
event and edits a sourcebook-zine, the Flicker Guide to the World of
Super 8. Satellite Flicker festivals spawned from the original now
take place bimonthly in Chapel Hill; Richmond, Va.; New York City;
Austin, Texas; and New Orleans. Twenty Flicker screenings have taken
place in L.A., and more than 200 have happened nationally and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "The Attack has made something simple even more simple," says
Lowell Northrop, an independent filmmaker also taking part in the
upcoming Attack. "If you can get your hands on a Super 8 camera,
there's no excuse for why you can't do the Attack."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Cheek held his own Attack of the 50 Foot Reels in L.A. It
featured work by filmmakers ranging from hobbyists to film students
to Hollywood players such as Peyton Reed, director of "Bring It On,"
and John Schultz, director of "Drive Me Crazy" and "Like Mike." Some
filmmakers provided CDs with dialogue and music for their films,
while others had actors add live narration or voice-overs.</TE>
<TE>   Reed's film "Wendy" was about a man spending the day with his
girlfriend -- who happens to be a puppet. Cheek's film "Satisfaction
Guaranteed" was both scripted in reverse and shot with the film
reversed to present a disjointed experience of a man eating a meal
backward.</TE>
<TE>   In a technological irony, this year's films have been transferred
to video for the first time so they can be projected on the
Egyptian's big screen, but spreading the gospel of Super 8 remains
the festival's charge.</TE>
<TE>   "Super 8 is the underdog," Northrop says. "It's disappearing ...
I'm glad there's somebody in this town who hasn't bought into the
idea that slicker is better."</TE>

<LD>The dreamachine -- a psychedelic contraption rumored to provide
psychic powers, invoke dream states and cure writer's block--has a
long association with rock. Beck and Iggy Pop each owned one. So did
Kurt Cobain and William Burroughs.</LD>
<LD>   Now Sotheby's is auctioning one as part of its semiannual Legends
of Rock sale. Beginning today and continuing through Nov. 10,
interested parties can bid on the dreamachine that was built for
Burroughs' 1997 funeral at www.sothebys.com.</LD>
<LD>   Invented in 1959 by author Brion Gysin and mathematician Ian
Sommerville, the dreamachine is a motorized cylinder, into which a
series of geometric shapes have been cut. In its center is a 200-watt
light bulb. When the cylinder spins, it creates a flicker effect that
works on the eyelids and affects the brain's cortical tissue. Sitting
within an inch of the spinning object, eyes closed, it is believed to
induce a visionary state in about 30 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   The machine up for auction was designed and built by David
Woodard, a friend of Burroughs who also built the two dreamachines
the legendary Beatnik used during his lifetime. Woodard also built
dreamachines for Beck and Pop, although he will neither confirm nor
deny that he constructed the one Cobain used before his death.</TE>
<TE>   Woodard had read about the dreamachine in Gysin's novel "The Last
Museum" and in Burroughs' "The Job," but it wasn't until he rented a
home in Napa Valley in 1992 that he was inspired to make one.</TE>
<TE>   His landlord was an old friend of Gysin's and had the templates
for the inventor's dreamachine design. Woodard used them to make one.</TE>
<TE>   When a friend offered to buy it, he built another and thus got in
the habit of making them regularly.</TE>
<TE>   The dreamachine on the block has a copper cylinder that's fitted
with rabbit fur and a rosewood base. Bidding starts at $500.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Literary renegade William S. Burroughs was a unique character, one
whose eventual success was fueled by his early failures. These days,
he is revered as a drug-addled philosopher and psychedelic literati,
but he may never have been known if it weren't for his inability to
find a publisher in the 1940s and his subsequent downward spiral into
the underworld.</LD>
<LD>   That's where his career truly began -- as a thieving morphine
addict traveling from place to place, a lifestyle he later used as
source material for his first published book, "Junk." Shortly
thereafter, he killed his wife, in what may or may not have been an
accident -- an incident he later credited as the true inspiration for
his writing and one that prompted his flight to South America.</LD>
<LD>   After spending some time in Ecuador and Peru, where he
experimented with the Amazonian psychedelic ayahuasca, Burroughs
settled in Tangier in the early '50s. It was there that he met Brion
Gysin, who invented, and introduced Burroughs to, the dreamachine.</LD>
<TE>   Gysin was a writer and a painter who thought of his art as spells
intended to produce specifics effects on viewers. He designed the
dreamachine to take things one step further. Using it, he believed,
would paint pictures inside the viewer's head. Although Gysin thought
the dreamachine would become "the drugless turn-on" of the '60s, it
never achieved that status. Still, it's had its faithful
practitioners, among them Burroughs, who used his to cure writer's
block.</TE>

<LD>Vintage sounds, tech spin</LD>
<LD>   The electronic down-tempo revival sparked by Washington, D.C.'s
Thievery Corporation has swept the West Coast like a Pacific breeze.
The Los Angeles duo Projections releases its debut CD, "Between Here
and Now," on Chicago's Guidance Recordings next month. Simon James,
29, and partner Dan Hastie, 27, have produced a pastiche of digital
soul, cool jazz and gangsta funk that kicks up the beats-per-minute
and feeds the tech appetite, all with vintage analog keyboards
(Rhodes, Hammond, Juno) and vinyl samples ("Anything on wax from '73
to '82 in the funk-soul-jazz department," says James). Then, using
sound-editing software, tunes such as the delicate, Mia Doi Todd-sung
"Luminate" are deconstructed and rewoven into live-sounding jams. "We
try to cross the live elements of the '70s sound with today's
technology," says the U.K.-born James. The result squeezes Antonio
Carlos Jobim, Chet Baker and King Tubby into e-music your father
could dig (tell us he wouldn't like the barbershop loops of
"Backbone"). Projections performs at the Monday Social at Las Palmas
Restaurant in Hollywood.</LD>

<TE>   Adding Willie's touch</TE>
<TE>   L.A. singer Carla Bozulich finished recording her radical remake
of Willie Nelson's classic 1975 concept album, "Red-Headed Stranger,"
way back in May, but she was happy to make room for another voice
when word came that Nelson himself wanted to get in on the fun.
Bozulich flew to Austin, Texas, this week and supervised as Nelson
added his vocals to her recordings of "Hands on the Wheel" and "Can I
Sleep in Your Arms." Says Bozulich: "I think our voices had a
remarkable relationship, because he has that crisp edge in his voice,
and I have sort of that warm fatness in my voice. There was something
really cool and romantic about it." Nelson had heard the album
through an employee at his label who's a friend of Bozulich and her
musical partner, guitarist Nels Cline. Bozulich is looking for a
label to handle the project, which she describes as "exploratory,"
"atmospheric" and "cinematic."</TE>

<LD>He scares  it well</LD>
<LD>   With a human-size Grim Reaper standing just inside the door to
greet them, about 200 people descended upon Dark Delicacies in
Burbank to meet the reigning king of horror, Clive Barker. The
50-year-old artist, author and director -- most notably of the
classic fright film "Hellraiser" -- was on hand Sunday to sign copies
of his new novel, "Abarat."</LD>
<LD>   His fans, however, were there to have him sign not only "Abarat,"
but also any other bit of Barker-related merch they had in their
possession -- pictures, posters, DVDs, CDs, T-shirts, records and
watch straps.</LD>
<TE>   Carrying a cardboard box loaded with two posters, six CDs and six
books, Mark Adams was first in a line that extended down an aisle of
vampire novels, past a coffin-shaped wall clock, out the door and
down the block. He was stressed, he said, with the pressure of having
to "sound intelligent" in front of Barker, who looked anything but
threatening in his red Chuck Taylors, blue jeans and a button-down
shirt.</TE>
<TE>   More intimidating was Barker's "executive protector" -- the tall,
dark and humorless man who was his bodyguard for the event. Although
his protector expected nothing to happen, at another signing a crazed
fan had apparently attempted to cut Barker with a knife and take some
blood.</TE>
<TE>   There was no evidence of such craziness at Dark Delicacies. Some
of the fans may have been wearing pentagram necklaces and
skull-and-crossbones rings, but their sole intent was to meet the man
behind "Saint Sinner" and "Tortured Souls," to have their picture
taken with the author and to ask about the next three books in the
"Abarat" series.</TE>
<TE>   When it came to the upcoming books, Barker was elusive, revealing
only that they will be released every two years and, not
surprisingly, get "darker and darker."</TE>

<TE>   Facing a brutal past</TE>
<TE>   Behind the glow of a candle, Sister Dianna Ortiz was a slight,
girlish figure in a dark jacket, cream-colored blouse and dangling
silver cross earrings, with a chin-length black bob.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week at the Latino Museum of History, Art and
Culture, in L.A., the soft-spoken American nun sat behind a long
table and began speaking in a firm voice about her torture in 1989 by
Guatemalan security forces, who also gang-raped her, leading to an
agonizing abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty minutes later, Ortiz read a passage from her memoir, "The
Blindfold's Eyes" (Orbis), that described another woman's torture in
the same prison. Her voice cracked and shook. Tears fell. Then she
dropped her head into her hands and sobbed. No one in the audience of
60 moved for several minutes while representatives of the reading's
co-sponsor, Amnesty International, spoke quietly with her.</TE>
<TE>   The reading was over, but she stayed to sign books. Ortiz, who now
is director of the Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition
International in Washington, looked back up. "I just want to
apologize for my breakdown," she said in a halting voice. "I know
Nov. 2 is coming up, and I'm feeling kind of raw."</TE>
<TE>   On that day 13 years ago during Guatemala's civil war, at age 31,
her story began.</TE>

<TE>   Of Joy and obsession</TE>
<TE>   You may never have heard of a band called Souled American, but
Camden Joy intends to change that. At Skylight Books on a recent
Saturday, the L.A.-born, Boston-based music writer read from his
newest book, a compilation of his early essays titled "Lost Joy" (TNI
Books), which includes his extended diatribes on Pixies lead singer
Frank Black, and his hilarious, poignant and obsessive manifestoes.</TE>
<TE>   Originally composed for Joy's innovative guerrilla poster
campaigns, these manifestoes appeared on mailboxes, telephone poles
and bus stops in New York City from 1995 to 1997. They addressed
subjects as varied as the inherent corruption of the major-label
record industry and the beauty of a band called Souled American.</TE>
<TE>   Joy's voice has earned him a bevy of dedicated admirers, including
writers Dave Eggers and Dennis Cooper. Cooper was in the crowd that
sat rapt as Joy revisited his obsession with Souled American. Reading
from a selection of his manifesto essays, Joy occasionally paused,
letting the band's folk-tinged melancholia float softly down from the
store's speaker system. "Looking back, I see these recurring themes,
story-wise," Joy says, "this idea of bittersweet nostalgia, like
waiting for a relationship to die so that you can mourn it. That's a
feeling that's all over 'Lost Joy.' "</TE>

<HD>Time to take back the night</HD>
<DH>In a year of tragedy, terrorism and shaky markets, maybe a
little Halloween-style escapism is just what we need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Noxon</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's Halloween and I for one am having no trouble at all finding
things to be scared about. Admittedly, I tend to flip out over things
like fruit suspended in Jell-O, men with comb-overs or a new Madonna
movie. But this year there's plenty of actual scary stuff to satisfy
the appetite for fear lurking in even the most well-balanced among
us.</LD>
<LD>   Not scared yet? You obviously skipped the front section of this
newspaper and its accounts of mad bombers, concealed snipers and
creative accountants. Compared with the house of horrors in hard
news, the cartoon ghouls and fun-house goblins back here in Calendar
are so many fluffy puppies. With war looming, terrorists striking and
the stock market quaking, a holiday based on fear feels if not
frivolous, then at least redundant. You might expect, then, that
Halloween would be waning, that sober heads would be prevailing, that
we'd be shying away from gruesome masquerades and frivolous
spectacles.</LD>
<LD>   Quite the opposite. Talk to party organizers, costume makers and
those who sell candy, pumpkins and those lawn displays designed to
scare the pants off neighborhood children and you find that people
are reveling in Halloween with as much enthusiasm and abandon as
ever.</LD>
<TE>   Halloween spending is expected to hit $6.9 billion this year -- $2
billion of that on candy alone, according to the National Retail
Federation. In Southern California, more than 350,000 revelers are
expected at the West Hollywood Halloween Carnaval, while turnstiles
are spinning at the five local theme parks offering fright fests.
Halloween fever is especially acute in Southern California, a region
that rarely passes up the chance to show off, dress up and go to
extremes. Exhibit A: One Irvine mail-order company is busy marketing
such items as an 11-foot-tall, $35,000 ogre that will greet your
trick-or-treaters with a terrifying growl and thundering fart.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the obvious question of why anyone would pay the price of a
tricked-out Volvo to stink up the front porch, the thing that's
puzzling is more basic: Why are so many of us compelled to whoop it
up during such uncertain times? The appeal to kids is obvious, one
best summarized in a two-word directive: Get candy. But what about
the grown-ups? What do we get out of Halloween?</TE>
<TE>   For most of us, the appeal is all about escapism. On this one
night, all of us can act like kids, act out secret fantasies and shed
our everyday selves. This annual license to bend rules of propriety
has been the heart of the holiday since North Americans began marking
the day 100 or so years ago. And although the holiday has changed
dramatically since then -- for one thing, kids today are no longer
encouraged to go out and smash windows as they once were -- Halloween
still works mainly as a mechanism to release whatever we normally
keep pent up.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to have fun and be silly," says Michael Kern, an
actor, activist and coordinator of the Carnaval costume party, which
has grown from a mostly gay event to become the center ring of the
Los Angeles area's Halloween circus.</TE>
<TE>   The impulse to primp, party and parade may even be heightened by
the sort of free-floating anxiety brought on by reports of terrorism,
recession and random violence. Last year, seven weeks after the World
Trade Center attacks, an estimated 50,000 more people showed up for
the annual street festival than had attended the year before. This
year, in the aftermath of a series of attacks on gay men that has
left West Hollywood stunned, an even bigger crowd is expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Tragedy and terrorism are nothing new to the gay community," Kern
says. "And we've learned the value of responding in force with
frivolity and silliness. It's how we survive."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, of course, the holiday is less about platform shoes and
feather boas than flesh-eating zombies and knife-wielding maniacs.
For most, Halloween is an opportunity to scream our heads off at the
Multiplex, freak show or haunted house. That's a whole lot of
hollering, representing a reservoir of fear born out of something far
deeper than the brief shock of being startled by so many simulated
homicides.</TE>
<TE>   The real source of those screams is the everyday fear we all
experience being alive in a world of death, disease, public speaking
and dentistry. We're all afraid, year round and deep down. The
question is, what do we do with that fear? Do we bury it in our guts
and let it harden into bitterness, spite or an intense desire to
throttle that idiot swerving in traffic while chatting on his cell
phone? As we drift off to sleep, do we curl up in a fetal position
and quietly blubber it away?</TE>
<TE>   Given the alternatives, maybe it's not such a bad thing that so
many of us dress up our fear in crazy costumes, splatter it with
stage blood and turn it into a moneymaking spectacle. You might even
call that patriotic.</TE>
<TE>   That was definitely a take-home message from Halloween 2001. With
the shock of the World Trade Center attack still fresh, Halloween
revelry was a lot less gory but no less enthusiastic. In Greenwich
Village, a few blocks from the still-smoldering ruins of ground zero,
the annual street fair was recast as a celebration of "Phoenix Rising
From the Ashes." All across the country, after fears of anthrax-laced
lollipops and shopping mall bombings led some to suggest a suspension
of trick-or-treating, Halloween's defenders came out in full force.
Kids shelved their Spider-Man masks in favor of firefighter helmets,
sales of Uncle Sam and Lady Liberty outfits boomed, and calls to
repeal Halloween were considered tantamount to admitting defeat to
the terrorists. "They can mess up the Postal Service," the governor
of Maine declared, "but they'd better stay away from
trick-or-treating."</TE>
<TE>   "People repossessed Halloween as an American institution," says
historian Nick Rogers, whose book "Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to
Party Night" was published this month by Oxford University Press. "Of
course, Halloween has never been endorsed that way -- it's not an
official government holiday. But the response last year shows how
much it does mean. It's the one night a year when people can flout
political correctness and let off steam."</TE>
<TE>   Although some revelers held back last year, it feels absolutely
right to go all out now, says Andrew Cosby, creator of UPN's
"Haunted" and a self-proclaimed "total Halloween geek."</TE>
<TE>   In years past, Cosby has dressed as a robot made of scraps from
Home Depot, a mutant plant that oozed glow-in-the-dark fluid and a
Ghostbuster armed with a fully functional proton pack. (I have no
idea what that is, but Cosby sounded so excited describing it, it
must do something really cool.) He took a post-9/11 breather last
year, but this week he's the host of a costume party to premiere his
latest creation: an exact replica of a bionic Bigfoot costume that
first appeared in 1976 on ABC's superhero series "The Six Million
Dollar Man," and returned three or four more times over the run of
the series. He's even created an accessory only a mechanical
Sasquatch could love: a Styrofoam boulder.</TE>
<TE>   "I go way overboard," he says. "I love having a costume that makes
people say, 'Oh my God, how much time did you spend on that?' "</TE>
<TE>   Cosby's handcrafted creations are positively subtle compared with
a new breed of contraptions that make your precious little
jack-o'-lantern look plain pathetic. Irvine mail-order company
Smarthome, which normally sells gadgets like light dimmers and
surveillance cameras, this year is rushing to fill orders from a new
catalog of "Extreme Halloween" items, according to the company's
marketing vice president, Matt Dean. Among the products are a Car
Thru Wall prop that simulates "a deadly accident" (cost: $4,999) and
a life-size Attack Alligator that lunges and snaps at unsuspecting
trick-or-treaters (cost: $13,999.99).</TE>
<TE>   Although it's tempting to sneer at anyone who would buy an Attack
Alligator, few of us could resist stopping by the homes of those who
do. I'd steer clear of the simulated car crash, however, a little too
much reality, thanks very much. So are, for that matter, most of the
menacing or violent costumes and props that pop up at this time of
year.</TE>
<TE>   At Hollywood Toys &amp; Costumes, the first thing you see when you
enter is a floor-to-ceiling tunnel lined with rubber masks molded
into every imaginable mutation, mutilation and injury. Security guard
Jimmy Donner says kids often erupt in crying fits when they spot the
display of scars, scowls and warts. But then a funny thing happens.
"Those same kids go running around looking for the most gruesome
costume they can find," he says.</TE>
<TE>   That same jittery air is a thick fog over Knott's Scary Farm,
where visitors pay $42 each to witness a bloody parade of
impalements, decapitations and even a close-up disembowelment. This
ranks on my personal list of Things I'd Like to Do somewhere between
a trip to the DMV and an appointment with the proctologist, but I'm
apparently part of a freakish minority. Attendance tops 25,000 on the
nights before Halloween, and park officials claim that 4.6 million
people have submitted themselves since the event began 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The patriotic observance of 2001 was only the latest shift, Rogers
says, in a holiday that has been in flux since the turn of the
century, when North Americans first imported the Irish and Scottish
celebration of All Hallows Eve (which itself was a hodgepodge of
ancient pagan customs and Christian observances of All Souls' Day).
At first, Rogers says, Halloween was mainly an opportunity for boys
to engage in what was widely viewed as healthy mischief; it was
common, Rogers says, for boys to celebrate by derailing streetcars,
opening up fire hydrants and tipping over outhouses. The practice of
trick-or-treating took off in the 1940s essentially as a way to
mollify the marauders with candy, he says. There's a debate about who
created it, Rogers says, but it was part of a larger effort to tone
down the raucousness -- the U.S. Senate even considered changing the
name of the holiday to Youth Honor Day and having adolescents pledge
to behave themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The name change died, but the effort worked, recasting a night of
pranks and destruction into an occasion when normal rules of order
are reversed, with children making demands and adults acting like
children. And while crowds thinned during 1970s tampering scares
(amplified by urban myths of razor blades in apples and angel dust in
candy bars), trick-or-treating remains the centerpiece of the
holiday. Ask anyone about Halloween and most often you'll hear a
story about some childhood adventure -- sometimes scary, sometimes
humiliating, always memorable.</TE>
<TE>   For me, the mere mention of Halloween instantly evokes a memory of
being shoved to the sidewalk and having my bag snatched by a kid in a
full Smurf costume. (But that was the fiercest, most muscular Smurf
you ever saw.) My wife has the scariest Halloween memory of all: Her
mother dressed her in billowy pants, a gold vest and handfuls of
gaudy jewelry, then sent her off to a Beverly Hills costume parade
with instructions to tell everyone she was a Bulgarian. She still
carries the scars.</TE>
<TE>   For an adult, it's hard to appreciate the childhood thrill and
shock of Halloween. A reminder of this primal appeal came five years
ago when we took some out-of-town friends to a haunted house held by
a group of local art pranksters called the Cacophony Society. Our
friends were visiting from their home near Sonoma, where they share
an idyllic country life collecting vintage wine and growing organic
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Stepping inside, I thought we had just made a horrible mistake.
There was a fellow in a blood-drenched butcher's smock who laughed
hysterically while taking swipes at a side of meat with a chainsaw.
On the walls were pages torn from fat-fetish porn magazines. Exiting
the room involved negotiating our way through a curtain of beef
tongues.</TE>
<TE>   It got weirder from there. By the time it was over, we'd been
flashed by a busty woman in a Mother Teresa costume, been offered
pieces of Spam sushi and witnessed a guy in surgical blues use a
vacuum cleaner to remove the guts from a man on a gurney.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the sidewalk outside, my friend the earth mother looked up
from a pattern of blood splattered on her blouse and smiled brightly.
"That sure was more interesting than the Getty Center," she said.</TE>
<TE>   I can't explain why all of us weren't more horrified, but I think
it had to do with the fact that, in the end, no matter what's going
on in the world, we're all just a little stranger, less tasteful and
just plain badder on Halloween. So I say bring it on, all of it, from
ax-wielding zombies to Attack Alligators.</TE>
<TE>   That Smurf who stole my candy, though -- that was just wrong.</TE>

<LD>Put angels, a tiger, Dracula and a mermaid in one fog-filled room and
what are they going to do? If Saturday's annual Halloween rave
Monster Massive, was any indication, they're going to dance like
there's no tomorrow. Nothing fuels a great dance party like the
anonymity of costumes from ironic to iconic. Even though the dizzying
laser light, stage fog and big-top atmosphere of Hollywood club life
can make every night seem like a little slice of All Hallow's Eve, on
the night of the real thing the town goes over the top.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight and this weekend, here's where to find the clowns, the
stilt walkers, the Goth nurses and even the SpongeBobs that make
Halloween the best dance night of the year.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   'Madness' at an  L.A. landmark</TE>
<TE>   Among the biggest of the Halloween night parties, this event --
billing itself as "13 Hours of Madness" -- offers a musically solid
lineup in a venerable L.A. location that includes Grant Plant, Danny
B., Oliver Twist, DJ Sol and more.</TE>
<TE>   Dollhouse, tonight, 3 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. Roosevelt Hotel, 7000
Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. (213) 891-2775.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Music magic in  a close setting</TE>
<TE>   L.A. festival favorite Doc Martin brings his house-music magic to
this multi-act bill. Joining the Doc will be Jason Blakemore, Wally
Callerio and others. With a limited capacity of 2,500 and a stellar
set of DJs behind the decks, this may be the sleeper event of the
night for those who want to share in the Halloween spirit in a more
intimate setting.</TE>
<TE>   Halloween Masquerade 2002, tonight. The Copacabana, 1600 Fairplex
Drive, Los Angeles. (714) 730-8505.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eclectic lineup  in Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach gets neither the love nor attention thrown L.A.'s way,
but the LBC scene will be celebrated at Club 49 on Halloween with an
eclectic lineup featuring acts from the world of funk, hip-hop,
reggae and dance. For those who don't feel like trekking to L.A.,
this is a nice alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Masquerade Ball 2002, Club 49, tonight. 49 S. Pine Ave., Long
Beach. (562) 495-1750.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Costume party  with a beat</TE>
<TE>   Intimate, though much flashier than other parties tonight, weekly
club Honey at Circus Disco offers up house music's Joenene for its
costume ball. Honey knows how to party, and on Halloween, you can bet
the place will be hot.</TE>
<TE>   Honey's Haunted House at Circus Disco, tonight. 6655 Santa Monica
Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 957-1181. www.circusdisco.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Local heroes  as headliners</TE>
<TE>   The newest kid on the club block gets a chance to make an
immediate impact with this Halloween costume party featuring cash
prizes for the best costumes. With local heroes Jason Bentley and
Gary Richards, the music should be of a high quality.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Bentley, Gary Richards, Stereo at Ivar, tonight. 6356
Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 692-2862.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Have a ball with a spin-meister</TE>
<TE>   For those who just want the party to keep going, Red grants your
wish with Junior Sanchez, a celebrated producer who has worked with
Basement Jaxx. But Sanchez is an accomplished spin-meister in his own
right, as he will surely show when he steps behind the decks for this
house-heavy set.</TE>
<TE>   Red Halloween Ball Featuring Junior Sanchez, Friday. Arena, 6655
Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 692-3533.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A bit of 'Heaven'  due in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   You may not know the name of Dutch singer Do, but you've probably
heard it. Her voice on DJ Sammy's hit "Heaven." She will be in town
for a midnight show the night after Halloween. Expect a major
production with dancers, band and all the stops pulled out.</TE>
<TE>   Do, Friday teknoklub. 6021 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. (213)

<HD>Confusion in the kitchen</HD>
<DH>The restaurant has an ambitious menu, but the dishes come
off as contrived.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After sitting abandoned for four decades, the Spanish Kitchen has
finally made an only-in-Hollywood comeback. Sure, the original site,
which dates from 1932, is now a tony day spa, Ona Spa. But
entrepreneur Greg Morris, who owns Belmont Lounge, has resuscitated
the name "the Spanish Kitchen" for his new La Cienega Boulevard
Mexican restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   It's taken months to transform the New Orleans-style Shark Bar
into a Spanish hacienda. The outside has been given the look of
weathered stucco streaked with pigment. Inside, wrought iron, colored
glass windows and colorful tile accents conjure up an old-style
Hollywood Mexican restaurant with about as much realism as the sets
in those old Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road movie. Here, the Dorothy
Lamour part is played by a bevy of waitresses in black peasant
blouses with red roses tucked in their hair.</LD>
<TE>   Hugo Molino, longtime chef at Parkway Grill in Pasadena, is
heading up the kitchen. Although the neon sign proclaims "authentic
Mexican," don't expect guacamole, soft tacos and green enchiladas --
Molino has brought his arsenal of California cuisine tricks to bear
on the menu. That means the tamales are filled with duck confit
rather than chicken, and the quesadilla -- filled with huitlacoche
(Mexican corn fungus) and Manchego (a Spanish cheese) -- comes with
an orange guajillo chile sauce combed into a decorative scalloped
pattern. Aztec broth is studded with filet mignon; crepes flavored
with Mexican cocoa are filled with lobster and Manchego in a tequila
lobster cream sauce.</TE>
<TE>   However, "elevated" ingredients such as filet mignon, duck,
lobster, rack of lamb and white chocolate don't necessarily make for
elevated cuisine. At this (very early) stage, the food comes off as
fussy and contrived; you end up longing for gutsier, more focused
flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we do need more ambitious Mexican restaurants that explore
the breadth of Mexican cuisine. I'm just not sure the Spanish Kitchen
has set off in the right direction with this first menu. It's not
going to satisfy either the kids looking for their fish taco fix or
the foodies in search of authentic regional cooking.</TE>
<TE>   If you're looking for an atmospheric spot for a drink, the chilled
Margaritas are generous and good. You can get a Cuban Mojito, too,
and fans of sangria can get their favorite by the pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   If you've never tried a Mexican wine, the wine list includes both
a Chardonnay and a Nebbiolo, along with wines from Argentina, Chile
and Spain.</TE>

<HD>Dear 'Diaries': Where's the scoop?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playwright Suzan-Lori Parks is a natural for the camera: wide-eyed,
smiling, bright and lively yet down to earth.</LD>
<LD>   Her sense of ease enlivens Oren Jacoby's "Stage on Screen: The
Topdog Diaries," a documentary about Parks that focuses on the
process of writing and rehearsing her Pulitzer Prize-winning
"Topdog/Underdog."</LD>
<LD>   But the film leaves a few questions unanswered and shows us a
little too much of the play.</LD>
<TE>   Jacoby and crew apparently didn't show up in Parks' life until the
summer of 2000, when they caught up with her at her new digs in
Venice. She had just moved to L.A. to take a teaching job at
California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. However, she recalls
how she wrote "Topdog" quickly in 1999 while she was "having a
difficult time at a regional theater." No juicy details follow.</TE>
<TE>   We see shots of Parks meditating on her Venice lawn and bicycling
through the streets, as well as her first day on the job at CalArts,
addressing her class of only two students.</TE>
<TE>   The camera catches a Parks telephone conversation with New York
Public Theater artistic director George C. Wolfe, discussing who will
direct her play, before Wolfe decided to do it. The film then follows
Parks on a trip to New Orleans with her fiance, Paul Oscher, a blues
musician who is credited with the music for the documentary. We see
how Oscher taught her about three-card monte, which is an important
ingredient in the play's narrative, and we later glimpse their
wedding day.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the film was shot in New York, where Jacoby was
allowed into rehearsals at the Public. The play opened there in the
summer of 2001 and moved to Broadway last spring. But all of the
excerpts from the play and rehearsals are of the Public production.
All we get from Broadway are snippets of the celebrities attending
the opening. There is no discussion of how the play did or didn't
change with the substitution of Mos Def in the Broadway cast for the
original production's Don Cheadle.</TE>
<TE>   Jacoby found some interesting archival material about the younger
Parks and a clip from a 1991 appearance she made on PBS, but there
isn't much here about the evolution of her themes and style.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that the play has been seen only in New York, it's a
mistake to show a national audience so much of it, especially key
events near the end of the play. If you don't want to know too much
before you see it, tune out before the show is over.</TE>

<TE>   A French aristocrat who oozes panache, but -- quelle horreur --
he's a vampire. If you really did have an interview with Lestat,
there would be no better place to take him for a tete-a-tete than the
bar at La Boheme. Enter the vine-covered mansion and drink in the
walls painted blood red with trompe l'oeil effects, the heavy velvet
curtains, glowing candelabra, waitresses in long black dresses and
mysterious painting over the fireplace, a portrait of a naked woman
looking like a sacrificial virgin with a menacing man standing over
her. Lestat's a show-off and a great conversationalist, but he can be
aloof at times. Get him to open up by ordering a drink to suit his
tastes, the one with the spooky name, Woo Woo. Lestat doesn't really
drink; still, he's a sensual creature. He'll appreciate the
rose-colored liquid and the aroma of fresh fruit. It's a concoction
of cranberry juice and a peach-flavored French liqueur, Mathilde,
garnished with a fresh orange slice. Take a sip and you'll appreciate
the vodka -- it will take more than an ounce of courage to listen
unflinchingly to the tale of terror he's about to unfold.</TE>

<LD>"THE Exorcist?" Linda Blair, child star of the 1973 film, does not
want to talk about her head-turning role in the horror classic. These
days she's busy as an advocate for critters of all kinds and will be
strutting down the ramp as a celebrity model at a fund-raising
fashion show to benefit Actors and Others for Animals on Nov. 16.
She's also the host of the ABC Family Channel's series "Scariest
Places on Earth."</LD>
<LD>   No tricks</LD>
<LD>   "I will be going to the health food store and buying treats to
hand out to the children in my neighborhood. Part of the fun is
oohing and aahing over the kid's costumes with parents and friends. I
also try to educate people on how to keep their pets safe during the
Halloween season. Cats are especially vulnerable and should be kept
indoors."</LD>
<TE>   Horsing around</TE>
<TE>   I used to train show horses because when I was younger I wanted to
be in the Olympics. But it's a hard business and it's hard on the
horses, so I stopped. My last horse I still have, it's like having a
big dog. His name is Coco and I take him for walks in Griffith Park.
Sometimes we ride, but we can't spend too much time out there because
the dogs -- I have chickens and dogs -- get a little bit mad that not
all of them can go.</TE>
<TE>   Into the water</TE>
<TE>   When I had more time, we used to go out to Malibu Lake where they
have canoe rides. I have three dogs, a Siberian husky, a
Staffordshire terrier and a pit bull. When we go to the lake, I load
them into the canoe and they sit peacefully. They also like to go
swimming and play in the water. That's something they find very
enjoyable.</TE>
<TE>   Dog paddling</TE>
<TE>   I was raised in Connecticut and I need nature -- I'm not a city
person in particular. So, I take my dogs to the parks and to the dog
beaches up and down the coast. One of my girlfriends lives in
Huntington Beach, and when we visit her, we go to Bolsa Chica --
that's the top priority. I have a lot of pictures of my dogs playing
in the waves.</TE>
<TE>   Vegan paradise</TE>
<TE>   I like to eat at Real Food Daily in West Hollywood and Santa
Monica. They have the same philosophy that I have about eating. I'm a
vegan and they have vegan recipes that you'll recognize. One is a
comfy "TV dinner," which is a soy-based "meatloaf" with mashed
potatoes and gravy. And they have lasagna that is like, "Wow!" --
better than anything you can imagine. I also like Native Foods in
Westwood. They make things I might not take time to cook at home:
nice warm meals in fall and winter, and lighter dishes in summer.</TE>
<TE>   Higher ground</TE>
<TE>   I am a highly spiritual person but not necessarily religious. Life
gets so busy but you should start and end every day with a few
minutes of meditation. Wake up and appreciate that you've been give a
fresh new day, a roof over your head.</TE>

<LD>POP MUSIC</LD>
<LD>   The Strokes strike L.A.</LD>
<LD>   The Strokes, heading back to L.A. for a pair of sold-out shows
Friday and Saturday at the Greek Theatre, have earned praise from
East Coast to West for some of the catchiest pop-rock songs since the
Beatles. So it makes perfect sense that guitarist Nick Valensi
recently began playing an Epiphone instrument identical to the one
John Lennon used. The band's year-old album, "Is This It," took a
huge jump up the charts recently because of a new version that
includes a bonus DVD.</LD>
<TE>   The Strokes, the Greek Theatre, 2700 Vermont Canyon Road, L.A.
7:30 p.m. Sold out. Also Saturday. (323) 665-1927.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Silk Road through Westwood</TE>
<TE>   Yo-Yo Ma, having gathered an aggressively multicultural ensemble,
has taken the Silk Road on the road. With instrumentalists from the
West and places such as Turkey, Tajikistan, India, and China, Ma and
his Silk Road Ensemble have been touring the world. Although it might
sound like just another of Ma's over-hyped cross-over projects, this
one really does appear serious and even revelatory. The musicians and
composers have been on a consistently high level, and the first CD
the group released last year proved surprisingly compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble, Royce Hall, UCLA. Friday, 8
p.m. $60 to $80. (310) 825-2101.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JAZZ</TE>
<TE>   A ripe young organist</TE>
<TE>   Joey de Francesco, the new master of the Hammond B-3, comes to
Steamers Cafe in Fullerton for a three-night stand. De Francesco, 31,
recently ended legend Jimmy Smith's 38-year reign as the No. 1 jazz
organist in Downbeat magazine's Readers Poll. An organist at age 6,
De Francesco was already performing with Miles Davis by the time he
graduated from high school and had a recording contract with Columbia
Records. He also worked as a sideman for John McLaughlin, Kenny
Garret, Stanley Turrentine, Grover Washington Jr., Pat Martino and
others.</TE>
<TE>   Joey de Francesco, Steamers Cafe, 138 W. Commonwealth Ave.,
Fullerton. Friday-Saturday, 8:30 p.m.; Sunday, 8 p.m. $13. (714)
871-8800.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FESTIVAL</TE>
<TE>   Dog day afternoon</TE>
<TE>   Finally, man's best friend gets a festival. The Natural History
Museum, in conjunction with its current exhibition "Dogs: Wolf, Myth,
Hero &amp; Friend," will hold a Dogs Festival on Sunday afternoon. The
USDA Beagle Brigade and other working dogs -- U.S. Customs dogs,
police dogs, fire department dogs, search-and-rescue dogs -- will
give demonstrations. Flyball and Frisbee dogs will perform. A live
fox and wolf will be on display. Dog training advice will be
available, plus crafts, games, raffles and more. The museum
recommends that attending dog lovers leave their own pooches safely
at home.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs Festival, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, 900
Exposition Blvd., L.A. Sunday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Outdoor festival
activities are free. Museum admission is $2 to $8; children younger
than 5, free. (213) 763-3466.</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Families' 'Tree'</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Gien's off-Broadway hit, "The Syringa Tree," the 2001 Obie
Award winner for best play, spans four generations from early
apartheid to present-day South Africa as it tells the story of the
love between two families -- one black, one white -- and of the two
children born into their shared household. Gien will alternate in the
multi-character role with Gin Hammond and Eva Kaminsky.</TE>
<TE>   "The Syringa Tree," Pasadena Playhouse, 39 S. El Molino Ave.,
Pasadena. Opens Friday, 8 p.m. Runs Tuesdays-Fridays, 8 p.m.;
Saturdays, 5 and 9 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and 7 p.m. Through Dec. 1. $39.50
to $44.50. (626) 356-PLAY.</TE>

<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   From the festival circuit</TE>
<TE>   "Tully," a film festival favorite from two years ago, makes its
way to theaters this week as a true independent. Starring Anson
Mount, Julianne Nicholson, Glenn Fitzgerald and Bob Burrus, it's
based on an O. Henry Award-winning short story by Tom McNeal about a
family of men -- two brothers and their reclusive father -- haunted
by a secretive past. Despite winning awards and critical praise, the
film was overlooked by distributors and is being self-released by its
producers.</TE>
<TE>   "Tully," unrated, opens Friday at the Laemmle Music Hall, 9036
Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, (310) 274-6869; UA Marketplace, 64 W.
Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (626) 795-3923; Edwards University Town
Center 6, 4245 Campus Drive, Irvine, (949) 854-8811.</TE>

<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Picking up the baton</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Harth-Bedoya, the Los Angeles Philharmonic's associate
conductor, returns to lead the orchestra this week. His program
includes Brahms' Symphony No. 3, Liszt's E-flat Concerto, with
American pianist Norman Krieger the soloist, and a selection of
Slavonic Dances by Dvorak.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Harth-Bedoya leads the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion, 135 Grand Ave. downtown L.A. Friday, 8 pm. Also
Saturday, 8 p.m., and Sun, 2:30 p.m. $14 to $82. (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<TE>   POP MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Back home</TE>
<TE>   You couldn't blame Salif Keita if he wanted to stay far away from
his native Mali, where as a youth he was shunned because he was
albino and was told that singing was not an acceptable pursuit for
someone of his aristocratic descent. But after years of living in
Paris and taking his African music into European-American pop
directions, Keita has gone home again. He's relocated to Mali's
capital, Bamako, and his new album, "Moffou," is a predominantly
acoustic recording that returns to the rural roots of his region's
music. In the process it showcases better than ever one of the most
acclaimed voices in African music.</TE>
<TE>   Salif Keita, Saturday at Royce Hall, UCLA. 8 p.m. $20 to $35.

<KH>POP MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>There's no silencing Veloso's spirit</HD>
<DH>Once persecuted in his native Brazil, the pop music genius
lights up UCLA's Royce Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Agustin Gurza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the moment Caetano Veloso glides onstage, landing flamingo-like
on one foot at the microphone, it's obvious he responds to odd
rhythmic impulses.</LD>
<LD>   The revered and graying Brazilian artist moves like a
not-quite-coordinated child discovering the joys of dance. He takes
jagged steps and awkward hops, then leans abruptly to one side as if
ambushing the beat. All the while, his long and gangly arms flutter
and flail and occasionally flow with the elegance of a hula.</LD>
<LD>   Somewhere in that spasmodic but graceful motion lies the genius
that revolutionized the smooth and soothing sounds of Brazil. At
UCLA's Royce Hall on Tuesday, Veloso showed that he is still driven
by the restless creative spirit that first gained him fame and infamy
in the late '60s.</LD>
<TE>   Veloso, 60, is considered one of Brazil's greatest living pop
music figures, a man whose musical concepts were so subversive he was
jailed in 1969, then forced into exile by his country's military
dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   His crime was playing a part in a brash, short-lived cultural
experiment called Tropicalia, which fused traditional Brazilian forms
with electric rock guitars, psychedelic sensibilities and avant-garde
poetry. Such fusions sound routine today but, at the time, the
Tropicalistas sparked an aesthetic upheaval that reshaped Brazilian
pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   Veloso continues to experiment with sounds and concepts, most
recently hip-hop. And he remains an especially challenging artist
onstage, speaking not a word by way of introduction or explanation.
His almost two-hour show Tuesday (the first of two scheduled nights
at Royce) featured songs that spanned more than three decades but
focused on selections from last year's acclaimed "Noites do Norte,"
which explores issues of slavery, racism and identity.</TE>
<TE>   Several people left before the close of Tuesday's show. Perhaps
they were among those superficially seduced by the media's anointing
of Veloso as a hip item for the world-music crowd. Perhaps they
expected more straight samba or soft bossa nova from the artist, an
exuberant admirer of the late Joao Gilberto. In any case, his
die-hard fans were in the majority and they adored him to the end.</TE>
<TE>   His eight-man band is all strings and skins. An array of Brazilian
and American drums produced syncopated patterns, now jagged, now
pulsating.</TE>
<TE>   The melodies, by turns sweet and dissonant, were left to amplified
guitars and an electric cello. The latter was played masterfully by
musical director Jaques Morelenbaum, a serene, balding, Buddha-like
figure beside the skinny, herky-jerky Veloso.</TE>
<TE>   The singer's nasal voice is as soft, lush and sensual as his
native tongue. All his lyrics were in Portuguese, except for an
unexpected English rendition of "I Only Have Eyes for You" and his
stunning reconstruction in Spanish of the Mexican classic "Cucurucucu
Paloma."</TE>
<TE>   Veloso is most commanding at a near-whisper, as he demonstrated
during one tune that he sang so softly that he was barely audible.
The audience had to chuckle at his uncanny ability to be heard
without raising his voice.</TE>
<TE>   That's a talent that marveled even those who tried to silence him.</TE>

<LD>There's no bigger target for ridicule in rock 'n' roll than old age,
so let the jokes begin: The Rolling Stones are coming to town for
three shows starting tonight at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Heard this one?</LD>
<LD>   Question: What are the six most dreaded words at a Stones concert?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Mick Jagger saying, "Here's one of our new songs."</TE>
<TE>   We could also go on about how the Stones tour should be sponsored
by AARP and point out that these guys were topping the chart before
Eminem was born.</TE>
<TE>   But the Stones, of course, always get the last laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Fans collectively will pay tens of millions of dollars to see the
band on this tour -- and they'll keep lining up for tickets as long
the Stones keep rolling, because they are unique. When they're gone,
there's nothing to take their place. Sorry, Aerosmith.</TE>
<TE>   You can be as cynical as you want about these grandpas' ability to
play exciting rock 'n' roll -- until the house lights go down. Then I
defy you not to be thrilled -- especially at the Wiltern, where we'll
have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see them in the intimacy of a
2,200-capacity room. The group's sensual sound is going to be so
overpowering that you're going to feel as if you are sitting in one
of the speakers, and Jagger will be so close you will be able to look
him in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder that this show sold out in 10 minutes?</TE>
<TE>   Jagger and Keith Richards may have more lines in their faces than
a street map, but they've mastered the guitar-driven celebration and
rebellion of the blues as well as anyone who ever stepped onto a
stage -- and they haven't lost the recipe.</TE>
<TE>   There is such magic in their recordings that to this day, everyone
who picks up a rock guitar is likely to try a Stones song. Even Bob
Dylan is delighting himself and audiences by playing "Brown Sugar" on
his current tour.</TE>
<TE>   If you have any doubt about the lingering allure of the Stones'
music, listen to "Forty Licks," the band's two-disc retrospective.
There are some forgettable new songs on it, but the classic '60s and
'70s tunes are as much starting points in rock 'n' roll history as
are Elvis Presley's "That's All Right" or Chuck Berry's "Maybellene."</TE>
<TE>   The first thing we hear on the album is the strum of the guitar,
followed quickly by the steady, repetitive sound of Charlie Watts'
drumming, Bill Wyman's sensual bass line and then Jagger's voice,
which matches the self-affirming energy and rejoicing of the guitar
so well that it serves as a fourth instrument. The song, "Street
Fighting Man," was one of Jagger's late-'60s attempts to reflect the
social rebellion of the times, but it's the music, not the hazy
lyrics, that defines it.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the Stones took marvelous steps toward expanding their
sound (going deeper into the blues in "Honky Tonk Women") as well as
some embarrassing stumbles into adult balladry ("Angie").</TE>
<TE>   They have been at their most powerful when they simply write songs
that seem designed to do nothing more than salute their own legacy as
a band with soulful and absorbing edges -- songs such as "Start Me
Up," "Tumbling Dice" and "It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (But I Like It)."</TE>
<TE>   What makes the Stones so satisfying live is that they improve on
the original recordings -- Jagger brings a greater maturity and
command to his vocals, and Richards and Watts, the other original
members, are more confident and expressive musicians. Trust me.
Staples will be exciting, Edison Field will be interesting, the
Wiltern will be priceless.</TE>

<LD>There's something lurking in the shadows. Something under the bed.
Every child knows that is where the wild things are, and this is
where great stories start. The hunt for creepy crawlies and boogeymen
delivers a good jolt of adrenaline, and that makes it monstrous good
fun.</LD>
<LD>   Writers have been stirring up frights since the Brothers Grimm.
From Maurice Sendak's children's classic "Where the Wild Things Are"
to R.L. Stine's "Goosebumps" series to Ray Bradbury's "Turn on the
Night," authors lure their readers by making the scary also
infinitely lovable -- monsters that obey pajama-wearing kids, horrors
that melt away with the rising sun. Nothing threatening, not too
drastic, just a flash of wonder and surprise.</LD>
<LD>   "Kids loved to be thrilled. They love that zing," explains author
and illustrator Tony DiTerlizzi.</LD>
<TE>   Just in time for Halloween, the holiday that celebrates a good
scare, DiTerlizzi has reached back 170 years to publish a new version
of a children's poem that contains what might be one of the most
quoted lines in English verse: " 'Will you walk into my parlor?' said
the Spider to the Fly."</TE>
<TE>   "The Spider and the Fly," written by Mary Howitt in 1829, is a
multi-generational testament to the fact that everybody delights in a
little fright. Initially DiTerlizzi had misgivings about updating the
famous verse -- after all, the hapless fly comes to a terrible end.
"We were concerned that it would freak kids out. So we test drove it
on teachers, librarians and children," DiTerlizzi recalls, adding
that "teachers had reservations, but the librarians were tickled
pink." And of the young audience: "They loved it! They ate it up!"
The eerily rendered images of the menacing spider and his "parlor"
frighten and delight children.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, families celebrate Halloween with goblins and ghosts,
witches and wizardry, the very things that frighten children. The
holiday has its roots in traditions that date back thousands of years
to the Celtic tribes of Northern Europe that, over the centuries,
became incorporated into the Christian observances of Allhallows Eve
and All Saints' Day -- days to honor ancestors. Why scare the kids?
Well, the best reason is that children love the thrill of surprise
and adults can see that youngsters get "a good scare" in a safe and
controlled environment. So out come the scary stories, tricks, treats
and costumes.</TE>
<TE>   And there are plenty of scares, tricks and treats to be had this
holiday. Tonight and through the weekend, all over the Southland,
there are haunted houses, trick-or-treat festivals, plays,
performances, parties and special events aimed to thrill and delight
children and adults. This, after all, is the perfect season for
children to dress up and play out their fantasies and poke fun at
their fears.</TE>

<LD>"The Red Balloon," a warm and poignant tale about a lonely little boy
who is befriended by a puppy-like balloon, started life as a novel by
Albert Lamorisse and became an Oscar-winning short film in 1956.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, Scotland's remarkable Visible Fictions Theatre
Company, one of the U.K.'s leading theaters for young audiences, has
given the story another magical incarnation: a live stage production.</LD>
<LD>   Audiences can see this delightful signature work in the company's
touring production that runs Friday at Irvine Barclay Theatre and
Nov. 15 at Thousand Oaks Performing Arts Center.</LD>
<TE>   When little Pascal (Christina Cochran) has his playful spirit
squelched by impatient adults (Stewart Cairns, Mary Well and Yngvil
Vatn Guttu in multiple roles), he finds a kindred spirit in a
mischievous balloon (gracefully manipulated, puppet-style, by
Cairns).</TE>
<TE>   Their exuberant friendship sweeps a few self-conscious adults
along in its wake, but threats exist, too, in the form of teachers,
bullies and a scolding mom.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to director Annie Wood, a gifted adult cast, and the
expressive simplicity of Karen Tennent's design, Lamorisse's
captivating tale is vibrantly alive, a treat for grown-ups too.</TE>
<TE>   Wood fills the stage with dynamic physical movement: droll
encounters between bustling adults during their morning rush, actors
twirling orange umbrellas for bus wheels, glimpses of city life
behind doors and windows that open and close with comic snap.
Meanwhile, the joyful and gentle interplay between the boy and his
balloon is counterbalanced by dignity-deflating slapstick aimed at
the rigid adults.</TE>
<TE>   A question overheard during Saturday's show at Glendora's Haugh
Performing Arts Center testified to the play's ability to spark
imaginations.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is her mom like that?" a child was heard asking when Pascal's
mother (unseen) scolded him. The small observer may not have realized
that Pascal, though played by a woman, was supposed to be a boy, but
she accepted without reservation the company's creation of a world of
humor, play, adult displeasure and poignant friendship.</TE>

<LD>A hybrid jam band composed of jazz-funk drums, electric guitar, banks
of delays and effects and -- yes -- symphony tuba, Drums &amp; Tuba roams
wildly from sugary, melodic jazz fusion at its least interesting to a
kind of prog-hop to even skronk and Sonic Youth-style guitar
hard-core at its best.</LD>
<LD>   The band's latest album, "Mostly Ape," is sometimes intriguing,
but at the Temple Bar on Tuesday its staple was junked-up hippie-band
grooves that got the college crowd dancing but were musical
dead-ends.</LD>
<LD>   Guitarist Neal McKeeby played two guitars simultaneously, one
around his neck and one mounted on a drum stand which he used to
create loops and effects. Tuba player Brian Wolff laid down not just
bass lines, but also incidental noises and beds of sound using
effects boards, and sometimes sang through his horn.</LD>
<TE>   Tony Nozero's groove-oriented drumming, though, set the tone from
which the evening would not escape -- danceable jams that despite
some pretty and complex jazz structures never jelled into songs.</TE>
<TE>   The opening act was That 1 Guy, a one-man band who plays the heck
out of a homemade instrument he calls the "magic pipe." Made of heavy
plumbing pipe, his instrument sports two different one-string guitar
segments and is fitted with contact mikes and triggers. Though his
music too was mostly percussive jams, his lyrics and jokes revealed
the personality and humor that Drums &amp; Tuba has yet to develop.</TE>

<LD>Imaginary Friends -- There may be no business like show business, but
neither is there any feud like a literary feud, and Nora Ephron,
writing her first play, has convincingly made one into the other.
"Imaginary Friends," her dramatization of the parallel and
conflicting lives of Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy, is a feast of
wit and language drawn from the words of her famous protagonists but
smartly shaped into a serious comedy with music (a handful of songs
by Marvin Hamlisch and Craig Carnelia) that grows into a hair-pulling
duel even Don King could appreciate. In this opening that is headed
to Broadway in December, Swoosie Kurtz plays the contentious
playwright-memoirist Hellman, and Cherry Jones is the formidable
critic and novelist McCarthy. Ephron seizes upon McCarthy's
denouncing Hellman as a liar on "The Dick Cavett Show" in 1980 and
works backward, filling in their stories from a vantage point beyond
the grave.</LD>

<LD>Let's see if I get the Calendar Weekend article on Echo Park cool
right ("Bohemian rhapsody," Oct. 24). Although musicians of note and
color have been in the neighborhood forever, what's really
interesting is that white people from elsewhere with more money now
have moved in and are actually playing musical instruments there.
Because of that, "For the past couple of years, its musical life has
been building toward critical mass." Wow.</LD>
<LD>   Amazingly, rents have gone up. And so have drink prices at the
Short Stop, where the conversations seem far less interesting than
when it was a "former hard-core cop bar," or when Dodger players
would pop in after a game. All this, and the article, is just too
precious for words.</LD>

<LD>Maria Elena Fernandez had a decidedly different experience at Ivar
than I did on a recent Saturday night ("Choose the mood," Oct. 24).
Anger was my "unchosen" mood. This is likely because she entered
knowingly into the owner's promotion scheme, whereas I was an
unwitting participant.</LD>
<LD>   I was invited to a birthday party and was told to get to the club
around 10 p.m. I was on a "priority" guest list and my cover was
being waived.</LD>
<LD>   My friend and I arrived around 10:30 p.m. to find 150 people
waiting outside. I informed the man behind the infamous velvet rope
that we were on the list. Without looking down at the list or at me,
he brusquely replied, "Yeah, that line over there."</LD>
<TE>   We waited ... and waited. 11:00. 11:30. One of the security guys
informs me that the club is nowhere near being full.</TE>
<TE>   Glancing at the cruisers on Hollywood Boulevard, I realize that we
are unpaid cast members in the ownership's advertising campaign. The
cruisers must be asking themselves, "Wow, what's that hot new place
that people are waiting to get into?"</TE>
<TE>   By 11:40 Napoleon ClipBoardaparte deigns to let us in. I'm now
told that the cover is 20 bucks! "I was told that the cover for
guests was waived," I protest.</TE>
<TE>   "That was for people who arrive before 11:00 p.m.,"
ClipBoardaparte replies.</TE>
<TE>   I walked out. The "velvet rope" is a part of New York culture that
Angelenos shouldn't stand for. L.A. is about space. We don't live in
tiny apartments. We can get together anywhere.</TE>

<LD>Egad! What chaos hast thou wrought!</LD>
<LD>   Where to begin?</LD>
<LD>   "Three Day Forecast." You seem to be fascinated with large
headlines. But when it comes to finding out what the event actually
is and where one could find it, the print is so small it would take a
magnifying glass to read.</LD>
<TE>   That comment holds for most of the edition. Most of the page is

<TE>   What happened to Radio Highlights? There are still a few of us who
listen to the radio as well as TV and it's nice to know if there is

<TE>   Your daytime TV listings may start at 1:00 p.m., but most of us
are awake a lot earlier than that and would like to know what's on TV

<HD>Fox gets clean-up hit with '24'</HD>
<DH>Show benefits from onslaught of promos that aired during
the World Series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, thanks, baseball fans. Based on Tuesday night's ratings, you
have helped ensure that the public will again be treated to a barrage
of promotion for Fox shows before, between and, yes, during innings
in next year's World Series.</LD>
<LD>   After a stretch in which none of Fox's programs had fared
especially well -- including the new David E. Kelley drama "Girls
Club," which was yanked Tuesday after just two telecasts -- the
critically heralded "24" delivered a stellar performance Tuesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Attracting a best-yet 13.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen
Media Research estimates, the serialized drama starring Kiefer
Sutherland dominated its competitive time period among the
young-adult demographics used as currency with advertisers --
surpassing, among others, NBC's "Frasier," which is showing its age,
posting its lowest rating for an original episode.</LD>
<TE>   Fox's "That '70s Show" also looked solid, drawing 11.2 million
viewers and winning its time slot in those same key demographics
against ABC's comedies "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage
Daughter" and "According to Jim," which had been thriving while the
Fox show was benched by the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers amount to a ninth-inning rally for Fox, whose strategy
of cramming promotion for its prime-time lineup into baseball has
looked increasingly suspect as the fall season has progressed.</TE>
<TE>   Although there's no way to directly measure the role baseball
played in alerting people to the return of "24," Tuesday's results --
reflecting a major surge from the 8.6 million viewers the program
averaged its first season -- provide at least some endorsement for
the value of big sporting events as a promotional vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on action and suspense, "24" was doubtless more
appetizing to men -- the principal component of the baseball audience
-- than "Girls Club," though to be fair, women shunned that series as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious that with a broader kind of show, with significant
male appeal, you do better" coming out of baseball, said Fox
Entertainment President Gail Berman, who, with the network buffeted
through last season and this fall, was breathing a small sigh of
relief.</TE>
<TE>   Networks have come to view televising sports as a loss leader --
making deals that lose money but yield ancillary benefits to other
aspects of their business, from boosting profits at their TV stations
to offering a venue to schmooze media buyers and sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Amid mounting losses, however, that approach has grown more
difficult to justify in recent years, prompting NBC to walk away from
its professional basketball and football contracts. In February, Fox
parent News Corp. underscored just how tough the economics of major
sports have become, announcing a $909-million write-down stemming
from its losses on baseball, football and stock-car racing.</TE>
<TE>   Even with Tuesday's bright spots, Fox concedes it is hardly out of
the woods in terms of its prime-time schedule. The failure of "Girls
Club" and poor ratings for an expensive new sci-fi series, "Firefly,"
leave significant holes to fill, and a new comedy, "The Grubbs," has
already been shelved. (The network will repeat "24" on Monday in
place of "Girls Club," providing another chance for viewers to sample
the show prior to the second telecast.)</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's box score, meanwhile, is bad news for those fans who
complained about the promotional onslaught they endured during games,
which again included computer-inserted ads in the background for Fox
shows. Some suggested that the network was, in effect, mistreating
visitors who wouldn't otherwise watch Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, all those promos did help build interest in "24." And
given how hard it has become to get noticed over the roar of the
cable crowd, networks will try to cash in on whatever leadoff hitters
they can find.</TE>

<LD>Here's the scoop on great sundaes</LD>
<LD>   The old-fashioned sundae at the Ivy is homemade. It begins with
two scoops of ice cream, Tahitian vanilla bean and praline. The
fixings for the sundae come on the side, so you can add as little or
as much as you please. There are white pitchers holding thick,
fudge-like chocolate sauce and true butterscotch sauce, both served
hot. Along with the sauces come bowls of whipped cream and toasted
almonds. (Old-fashioned sundae, lunch, $10.75; dinner, $11.75.)</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still following Grandpa's recipe</TE>
<TE>   They've been making ice cream at Fosselman's Ice Cream for 82
years and serving sundaes for just as long. In fact, they use their
grandfather's recipe for the hot fudge sauce, a thick, silky,
bittersweet fudge that you can order on any of the shop's 48 flavors.
The sundae is topped off with whipped cream and chopped peanuts,
walnuts and almonds. (Hot fudge sundae, small, $3.10; medium, $3.75;
large, $4.40.)</TE>
<TE>   Fosselman's Ice Cream, 1824 W. Main St., Alhambra, (626) 282-6533.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No skimping  on the sauce</TE>
<TE>   Instead of ordering a mere cone, go all the way and get a hot
fudge sundae at Eiger Ice Cream &amp; Yogurt. You can get it with one or
two ample scoops of ice cream. The sauce is a milk chocolate fudge
(and lots of it), crowned with whipped cream and sprinkled with
toasted almonds. (Hot fudge sundae, one scoop, $5.90; two scoops,
$7.90.)</TE>
<TE>   Eiger's Ice Cream &amp; Yogurt, 124 S. Barrington Place, Brentwood,
(310) 471-6955.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some sip while others slurp</TE>
<TE>   Coffee Importers is a coffee spot that also serves a fine hot
fudge sundae. On a layer of homemade milk chocolate fudge, they put
one or two scoops of ice cream (your choice) and then another layer
of hot fudge. Toasted mixed nuts and a maraschino cherry go on top.
(Hot fudge sundae, one scoop, $3.39; two scoops, $4.64.)</TE>

<HD>Hitching a ride on TV's hits</HD>
<DH>'I Spy' leads a pack of remakes that depend on the
likability of stars old and new.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne Valdespino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It didn't work for "Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle," "Leave It to Beaver,"
"McHale's Navy" and "The Mod Squad." But it did for "The Fugitive,"
"Mission: Impossible," "Maverick" and the granddaddy of TV franchise
flicks, "Star Trek."</LD>
<LD>   The most recent wave of movies built on the creative backs of old
TV shows hits Friday with "I Spy." The new Eddie Murphy-Owen Wilson
film based on the groundbreaking '60s series, which co-starred Bill
Cosby and Robert Culp, leads a pack of TV conversions that includes
"Starsky &amp; Hutch," "S.W.A.T." and the sequel "Charlie's Angels: Full
Throttle."</LD>
<LD>   If it seems that studios are scraping the bottom of the boob-tube
barrel with "Scooby-Doo," "Josie and the Pussycats" and even "The
Crocodile Hunter," it's worth remembering the allure of popular
small-screen subjects for studios executives in the high-risk movie
game -- the TV series are proven commodities.</LD>
<TE>   Consider this: In 50 years of prime time and about 5,000
prime-time series, only 200 to 225 shows lasted more than five years.
Choose a story from the top 200 and it seems like money in the bank:
If viewers watched it hundreds of times at home, they'll love it on
the big screen. Right?</TE>
<TE>   That's hard to predict, even for Earle Marsh and Tim Brooks,
coauthors of "The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable
TV Shows." "It's a double-edged sword," Marsh said. "Yes, people are
familiar with the story, but the flip side is they have preconceived
expectations and if the movie doesn't deliver ... it's not going to
work."</TE>
<TE>   As remakes go, both said "I Spy" shows promise. It's got plenty of
action potential, and TV heads will remember it as a cutting-edge
show.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time an African American had a lead in a
dramatic series," Marsh said. "Bill Cosby opened up a door that let
Diahann Carroll in with 'Julia' and that eventually led to the Norman
Lear shows in the '70s: 'Sanford and Son,' 'The Jeffersons' and 'Good
Times.' "</TE>
<TE>   "I Spy" the film bears little resemblance to the TV series except
that it has a strong buddy factor and one character's cover is that
of a professional athlete. Cosby was a tennis pro but Murphy is a
boxer. Still, the original show was well regarded -- it won three
lead actor Emmys for Cosby -- and audiences will remember that he
added an extra zing, Marsh said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was something appealing about Cosby, and that was what made
'I Spy' unique. He came up doing comedy albums and I can't think,
prior to that, of a comic -- black or white -- having a lead in a
dramatic TV series."</TE>
<TE>   When translating TV scripts to movies, there are no real rules,
only hunches. "The things that tend to play better on the big screen
are the things with more action and things that can be done
tongue-in-cheek and get laughs. That helped 'The Brady Bunch,' 'The
Beverly Hillbillies' and 'The Flintstones,' " Marsh said.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said some of the best TV-based films marry a hit television
series' stories and characters with big-screen action and special
effects, hence the success of the "Star Trek" movies.</TE>
<TE>   Casting, too, is critical, but when filmmakers are trying to
translate a well-known TV show, the process is more complicated.
"When you have a TV show that was dependent on the likability of a
specific character and translate it to the big screen and don't have
someone very likable too, you have a problem," Marsh said.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Macnee was just too tough an act for Ralph Fiennes to
follow in "The Avengers." "Macnee had a certain quality that lasted
12 years," Marsh said. "It started in the late '50s in England, and
then he did the new 'Avengers' that showed up on late night in this
country. He'd have different female leads, helpers or associates, but
he was the linchpin of the series."</TE>
<TE>   Mel Gibson in "Maverick" fared better, Marsh said. "He had the
same likability in the '90s that James Garner had in the '50s and
'60s. He was the perfect fit."</TE>
<TE>   So was Tom Cruise, a "we'll see him in anything" kind of star, who
added sparkle to "Mission: Impossible."</TE>
<TE>   "In the TV series, it was all about the complex way in which they
set it up; you could do a caper movie with anybody, and Tom Cruise
didn't hurt," Marsh said.</TE>
<TE>   Does the upcoming "Starsky &amp; Hutch" movie have a chance with its
strong buddy factor and likable cast (Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson)?
Sure, said Marsh, especially if it capitalizes on the action, as the
TV series did. "Nothing in the '70s was as fast as 'Starsky and
Hutch.' " So, which TV shows could be slam-dunk hit movies? "Gomer
Pyle," starring Adam Sandler and Robert De Niro? Antonio Banderas and
Melanie Griffith in "I Love Lucy?" How about "Combat" starring Nick
Nolte, Tom Sizemore and two or three of the Baldwin brothers?</TE>

<KH>A NIGHT AT</KH>
<HD>Zanzibar's Arabian nights</HD>
<DH>Middle Eastern ambience mingles with world music at the
former site of the West End.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Justin Hampton</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tradewinds of change have apparently blown a twister through the
former West End nightclub in Santa Monica. Where once stood a
no-frills live venue hosting disco and reggae/rock cover-band nights
popular with the frat crowd now stands Zanzibar, one of the
Westside's most elegantly appointed pleasure palaces.</LD>
<LD>   Staff members joke about all the broken teeth and carrot sticks
they had to clean up in the 19 days it took to transform the space
into an upscale, Moroccan-flavored DJ salon. Louie Ryan, who co-owns
and operates Zanzibar with his wife, Nettie, explains: "The vision
for Zanzibar grew from our desire to build and design a DJ lounge
that had a comfortable vibe but was unpretentious.... We wanted a
de-emphasis on race or one particular culture dominating a club."</LD>
<LD>   The Ryans have already delivered a similar ambience to Westside
patrons with their other club, the Temple Bar on Wilshire Boulevard.
Since 1999, it has tempted multicultural hipsters out of their holes
with a combination of ritzy bar food (care for some fried plantains
with your Mediterranean pasta?), lush red interiors and pan-African
live funk and world music lineups.</LD>
<TE>   So consider Zanzibar the Temple Bar's distant cousin from back
East -- the Middle East, in this case. Get set for a whiff of
sandalwood incense as you blow in from the club's side entrance on
Arizona Avenue, and don't forget to bring night-vision goggles -- tea
lights and sparse overhead illumination create the darkened,
cavernous feel that reminds a clubgoer why bats developed sonar.</TE>
<TE>   The outer lounge area opens up early, at 5:30 p.m., and local
music and film industry professionals have already secured this spot
for the inner-contentment sensibility most happy hours don't provide.
The dance floor opens at 9 p.m., and the clientele expands to include
sophisticated 20-something clubbers and well-heeled, casually attired
professionals who happen onto the club through word-of-mouth or
announcements on local listener-supported radio station KCRW-FM
(89.9).</TE>
<TE>   "When [people] get here, they're here to listen to the music and
talk to their friends, as opposed to seeing who else is coming," says
Carly Gecima, 25.</TE>
<TE>   The space offers club patrons ample opportunities to enjoy the
music or just enjoy each other. Lounge areas on opposite ends of the
room flank the DJ booth and the soundboard. Here, wallflowers can sip
their Mai Tais on tan leather poufs and adjust the curtains hanging
from the ceiling for a more private affair. Clubgoer Ghislane
Sefroui, who recalls the West End's "black box" interior, considers
it an improvement. "The atmosphere's very loungey and comfortable,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   Zanzibar inherited a powerful sound system from its previous
tenants that can handily accommodate live musicians. But with a few
notable exceptions, such as a rare area appearance tonight by
ethno-techno pioneer Banco de Gaia, and another by Bay Area hip-hop
heads Blackalicious on Nov. 23, clubgoers shouldn't expect to see too
many live acts. Rather, Zanzibar is staking its claim on area jocks
like KCRW's Garth Trinidad, who hosts a free Sunday DJ session, and
local dance floor hero Jason Bentley, who recently moved his popular
Bossa Nova club night from Club Sugar to Zanzibar for the Friday
night action.</TE>
<TE>   Every now and then, an occasional straggler from the West End days
will show up and wonder what's up with all of the Arab decor -- and
for them, the owners still maintain the coin-operated condom machines
in the restrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Funky decor and West End memories aside, Zanzibar shares the
operational slogan "Diversity Through Music" with the Temple Bar. But
in this case, it comes from the modern-day culture of the DJ.
"They'll go from Asia to Africa to America and Europe and back in
their selections," says Louie Ryan. "And we design clubs that evoke
that same vibe.</TE>

<HD>It's all in ghoulish fun</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Heidi Siegmund Cuda</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los ANGELES has always had an appetite for destruction, manifested in
recent years in a thriving underground of gothic and darkwave dance
club subcultures. In Ghoul Skool, death rock's found a permanent
crypt at a somewhat unlikely location: the Spike on Santa Monica
Boulevard. Each Wednesday, the music's hard-core devotees turn out to
dance to the tunes that inspired them to shave their heads and pierce
their souls in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   It took a guy from Jersey to find potential in Spike, and it
didn't hurt that he also had a wicked imagination. With a little
change of dress code, promoter Mark Splatter transforms the old bar
into a haunting dance club where death becomes you.</LD>
<LD>   The low-key bar, a stinky nightspot with few redeeming qualities,
is just the right hellhole for Splatter to create his scene. At Ghoul
Skool, pumpkins flicker year-round and cobwebs swing from disco
balls. Everyone comes dressed in ghoulish costumes, which, for some,
is their everyday streetwear: bondage pants, combat boots and skull
tees.</LD>
<TE>   You're greeted at the door by a postmodern primitive girl with
more piercings than the moon has rocks. The cross-dressing
bartender's brewing up Virgin Prunes (Jagermeister and Dr. Pepper),
Strawberry Switchblades (strawberry vodka) and Black Plagues
(Kamakazis made with black vodka).</TE>
<TE>   Although it all may sound spooky, Ghoul Skool's done in the spirit
of fun. Like the music, which demystifies, celebrates and pokes fun
at the taboo subject of death, the fans play out Halloween fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up watching horror movies and writing scary stories, and
when I found out there was music out there that mirrored the horror
movies, I was hooked," says Splatter, a graphic artist and Web
master. "It doesn't necessarily need to be depressing. It's more
about having fun. It's all done tongue-in-cheek."</TE>
<TE>   With Splatter and guests DJing, Ghoul Skool is really a place to
let loose on the dance floor. As white-faced skeletons shadow-dance
beside you, you get schooled in classic death-rock music. Among the
artists spun each week are Christian Death, 45 Grave, the Cure, the
Cramps, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Bauhaus. Not content to be
predictable, Ghoul Skool mixes things up with fast and furious rock
and punk by the Buzzcocks, the Dead Boys, the Damned, T.S.O.L., Devo
and the Ramones. Even if you're only out to observe, it's pretty darn
cool to watch the dancers get into it.</TE>
<TE>   For some, death rock is a way of life, a permanent rebellion often
brought on by religious upbringings. To really understand death rock,
take a glimpse at Marilyn Manson's book "The Long Hard Road Out of
Hell." His intense allergic reaction to his Christian upbringing
results in his reincarnation as Lord Manson. The book reads like a
sort of how-to guide for creating a death rocker.</TE>
<TE>   At Ghoul Skool, you'll find death rockers from all walks of life
-- from those who revel in rebellion to those who just wanna play
dress-up and let out a howl or two. Just say, "Boo."</TE>

<DH>Hal Willner gathers an eclectic coven of performers to pay
tribute to the enduring words of Edgar Allan Poe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What would Edgar Allan Poe have to say about a world in which we walk
in fear of a serial sniper, sit seemingly perpetually on the brink of
war and live in a general cloud of post-9/11 uncertainties?</LD>
<LD>   He already said it, before even the Civil War and the
assassination of Abraham Lincoln scarred the national psyche, says
rocker Lou Reed. To the former Velvet Underground leader, Poe's
probings of the recesses of the human subconscious in such works as
"The Raven," "The Telltale Heart" and "The Pit and the Pendulum" seem
to have anticipated modern horrors.</LD>
<LD>   "He's, to my mind, more relevant than ever," says Reed, one of the
stars of a Halloween Poe performance tonight at UCLA's Royce Hall.
"That's why he's a world-class legend. And that's why his work
endures; it's very intriguing interior psychology -- about compulsion
and obsession. I don't see how you could miss the connection."</LD>
<TE>   It's a connection Reed hopes to bring to life as one of the
performers in tonight's "Never Bet the Devil Your Head."</TE>
<TE>   The show is the brainchild of Hal Willner, who, beyond his work
producing albums and the music on "Saturday Night Live," is also
known for creating spoken-word albums with William Burroughs and
Allen Ginsberg as well as high-concept artist tribute projects
honoring avant-garde filmmaker and music collector Harry Smith, Nino
Rota, Kurt Weill and Thelonious Monk.</TE>
<TE>   This show, also featuring Harry Shearer, Will Ferrell, Catherine
O'Hara, Karen Black, Howard Hesseman, Chloe Webb and others, is the
second annual Poe event at UCLA and follows New York editions Willner
produced in 1995, 1998 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   For Willner, the show last year -- just seven weeks after the
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon --
affirmed not just Poe's relevance but also the merit of a body of
work that's about more than fears.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year there was talk that maybe it wasn't the right time for
this," Willner says. "On the other hand, what better time is there?
This is one of our great writers, and the tone of his pieces is not
just dark. What's art for? Healing. I find Poe very healing,
incredibly magical and spiritual, gets you centered."</TE>
<TE>   Like most people, Willner, 46, and Reed, 60, each first
encountered Poe in Vincent Price movies and grade-school
memorizations of "The Raven." But they both explored further and
found much more to the body of work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting how Poe is so associated with Halloween, but so
many of his poems are so romantic," Willner says. "The stuff reads so
beautifully and adapts to music so well. I always loved it."</TE>
<TE>   They first teamed on Poe when Reed was one of the participants in
the 1995 Halloween show in New York, reading "The Tell-Tale Heart" at
an event that included Ginsberg, Abel Ferrara, Diamanda Galas,
Gregory Corso and Deborah Harry. Reed was then recruited by maverick
theater director and designer Robert Wilson to collaborate on a stage
work built on Poe material. Titled "POEtry," the ambitious effort
included classic Poe works and Reed's barbed reinterpretations and
musical adaptations. It premiered to critical praise in Hamburg,
Germany, last year and then played in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Willner, who produced Reed's 2000 album, "Ecstasy," signed on to
produce "The Raven," an album drawn from the theater production, with
Reed joined by a cast including Willem Dafoe, Elizabeth Ashley, Steve
Buscemi, Amanda Plummer, David Bowie, Laurie Anderson, Ornette
Coleman and the Blind Boys of Alabama. Two versions will be released:
a two-CD set of music and spoken-word pieces and a single-disc
condensation with heavier emphasis on the songs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been rewritten since the time of the play," Reed says. "This
could be staged as well. It's a pretty amazing cast of actors and
actresses. Some of the things in it don't exist in Poe. The speech
Amanda gives, 'Imp of the Perverse,' is not in Poe at all. There is a
thing called 'The Imp of the Perverse,' which is a piece he wrote,
but the piece in here is just in the style of Poe ... seeking to
communicate to a contemporary audience."</TE>
<TE>   So far it seems to be working.</TE>
<TE>   "I performed 'The Raven' recently at the Bumbershoot Festival in
Seattle -- 22,000 people in a stadium, and they loved it," Reed says
of his reworking of Poe's most familiar poem. "I talked to some of
them afterwards and they remembered it from school, but not like
this. They could relate to this one."</TE>
<TE>   Willner notes that Reed's hardly the first to take liberties with
the original material.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember films like 'Black Cat' and 'Spirits of the Dead' -- they
were all adapted, the endings changed, characters added," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Willner, in fact, is encouraging the performers to bring their own
spins to the Halloween show, as he does with all such projects.</TE>
<TE>   Reed will be doing "The Raven" as well as performing his song
"Perfect Day" (a new version of which is on his upcoming album) and
the '70s song "Candy Says," backed by New York band Antony and the
Johnsons. Shearer, who voices many characters on "The Simpsons," will
lend his talents to "The Pit and the Pendulum." Spooky ambience will
be added in the show with performances by Pamelia Kurstin, a master
of the theremin, and goth-drama band the Voluptuous Horror of Karen
Black -- sharing a stage for the first time with its namesake
actress.</TE>
<TE>   The anything-can-happen sense is typical Willner, who is currently
collaborating with Robert Wilson on a one-woman show for Danish
actress-singer Ulla Henningsen -- and he's not afraid to acknowledge
Poe's dark allure.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just lucky," Willner says, "to get the chance to put my
unhappy childhood out to the world -- my childhood obsessions."</TE>

<LD>"We're all pink on the inside." -- Pink</LD>
<LD>   Dye your hair</LD>
<LD>   Pasty-faced Brits and angry punk rockers have been coloring their
locks a variety of hues since the early '70s, but there's still
something about hair aberration that riles authority figures. Make an
anti-conformist statement or reclaim your individualism with a box of
peroxide and Day-Glo green.</LD>
<TE>   Try one name only</TE>
<TE>   Beck, Sting, Bono, Shakira -- it works! Take your cue from Pink
and select a moniker that is strangely innocent, baffling and
slightly threatening. If you opt for a color as name, match it to
your newly dyed hair.</TE>
<TE>   Say it loud</TE>
<TE>   Even though she is neatly packaged as teen pop, Pink is never
afraid to be a publicist's nightmare. Instead of Britney's squeaky
clean, Pink is rough around edges, speaking her mind with a mouth
like a truck driver.</TE>
<TE>   Leave 'em guessing</TE>
<TE>   After releasing the sugar-sweet R&amp;B assemblage "Can't Take Me
Home," Pink upset the status quo by going gritty for last year's
"Missundaztood." Raunchy and rolling party anthems were part of a new
package, with Pink getting wild in the studio with folks like rockers
Steven Tyler and Richie Sambora.</TE>
<TE>   Believe in yourself</TE>
<TE>   Discouraged by teachers and mocked by her peers, Pink persisted in
her pursuit of the mega-celebrity dream. Look who's laughing now.</TE>

<HD>Heston ignores Moore's plea</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Charlton Heston spoke Wednesday at a National Rifle
Assn.-sponsored get-out-the-vote rally in Tucson, Ariz., despite a
last-minute plea from filmmaker Michael Moore asking him to drop out.</LD>
<LD>   The event, held two days after a University of Arizona student
there shot and killed three professors and himself, would only cause
more grief to relatives and friends, Moore said.</LD>
<LD>   "These are not the actions of a once brave and decent man," he
wrote in a letter that was sent to Heston and posted on Moore's Web
site. About 500 people, including gun control advocates, attended the
rally. Bill Powers, a spokesman for Heston, said the event had been
planned months ago. NRA President Heston, who recently announced he
is in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's, spoke for a few minutes,
Powers said.</LD>
<TE>   Moore's most recent film, "Bowling for Columbine," examines
violence in America and includes an unplanned interview with Heston.
The result was so unflattering that Jack Gilardi, Heston's agent,
said, "I don't believe Mr. Heston would listen to Michael Moore."</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Liza Minnelli won't become another Ozzy Osbourne.</LD>
<LD>   VH1 has pulled the plug on the singer's planned reality TV show,
complaining that her husband, David Gest, was impossible to work
with.</LD>
<LD>   "We weren't given the kind of access and cooperation we needed to
make the show work," VH1 spokeswoman Laura Nelson said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Gest would repeatedly cancel production meetings and shooting
schedules, and restricted VH1's access to his wife, according to an
official at VH1 who spoke on condition of anonymity. He was also a
"neat freak" who ordered a VH1 staff member to stand duty with a
vacuum cleaner while a hole was drilled in a wall, the source said.
The New York Post said Gest required VH1 crew members to wear
surgical booties while in their apartment.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Minnelli declined to comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   When plans were announced this summer, the show was supposed to
start in October. But it got pushed back to December and then
January. Only one episode has been filmed.</TE>

<LD>Seven months after winning the Oscar for directing "A Beautiful
Mind," Ron Howard finally has another movie to make.</LD>
<LD>   He had planned to remake "The Alamo," then dropped out of the
project. Now he's set to direct what his company, Imagine
Entertainment, describes as a suspense story set in the Old West,
based on the novel "The Last Ride" by Thomas Edison. Filming is
scheduled to begin in March.</LD>

<LD>Sotheby's auction house, which already has been fined $45 million for
price fixing in the United States, has been assessed $20.2 million
more by the European Union on similar charges, the BBC reports.</LD>
<LD>   Rival Christie's also was implicated in the scandal but escaped a
fine because it "was the first to provide crucial evidence," the
commission said. The firms were accused of inflating commission fees
during the 1990s and defrauding art sellers of $400 million.</LD>

<LD>Straight from Hammer's house</LD>
<LD>   In the '30s, Universal Studios produced such horror classics as
James Whale's "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein," and Tod
Browning's "Dracula." In the late '50s, the scrappy British studio
Hammer Films added a few twists on the tales. Warner Home Video has
released two of the best on DVD: "The Curse of Frankenstein" (1957)
and "The Horror of Dracula." Peter Cushing stars in "Frankenstein" as
the scientist with Christopher Lee as the terrified monster
brutalized by Frankenstein.</LD>

<TE>   Shocking 'Look'</TE>
<TE>   Nicolas Roeg directed the brilliantly evocative and terrifying
1973 thriller, "Don't Look Now," based on a Daphne DuMaurier story.
Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland are marvelously subtle, the sex
scenes raised eyebrows and the finale is a shocker.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Implied horrors</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s, Val Lewton produced a series of low-budget horror
films including "Cat People," whose chilling horrors were mostly
implied. Director Alejandro Amenabar continues the tradition with
"The Others," centered on a young woman (Nicole Kidman) and her
children, whose hypersensitivity to light keeps them indoors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Overlooked orphanage</TE>
<TE>   Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's atmospheric ghost story "The
Devil's Backbone," set during the Spanish Civil War, finds a boy
abandoned at a decrepit orphanage. An overlooked gem.</TE>

<LD>The highlight of Contemporary Classics of the Korean Cinema, which
presents six features Friday through Sunday at USC, is its concluding
film, "Chihwaeseon," a masterwork by South Korea's leading veteran
filmmaker, Im Kwon-Taek, who will be present screening. Im won the
2002 best director prize at Cannes for this compelling work revealing
the formidable challenges Jang Seung-up, later known as Ohwon (a
forceful Cho Min-sik), overcame as a low-born iconoclast to become
widely heralded amid Korea's late-19th century unrest.</LD>
<LD>   In his struggle to pursue painting, Ohwon was influenced by the
Chinese watercolor masters and achieved fame as "the drunken master
of painting" (a translation of the film's title). In this exquisite,
demanding film, Im would seem to embrace with a camera Ohwon's own
precepts as he held his brush: "Paint not the object but the thought
it evokes."</LD>
<TE>   If Im is a classicist, Hong Sang-soo is emerging as one of South
Korea's most original younger directors. His "Virgin Stripped Bare by
Her Bachelors" on Saturday recalls the French New Wave in its wry,
graceful take on sex and love, black-and-white print and Godard-like
punctuations. But the film is all Hong's: a developing triangle
divided into five chapters that move back and forth in time. There's
also a revealing switch between the point of view of the woman (Lee
Eun-ju) and the two men, one gentle and romantic (Jeong Bo-seok), the
other (Mun Seong-kun) married and forceful.</TE>
<TE>   The tone begins on a humorous note but grows darker as we discover
how awkward romance can be. The UCLA Film and Television Archive's
Halloween treat is the lush 1943 Technicolor version of "The Phantom
of the Opera" tonight. Claude Rains is a heartbreaking phantom in a
splendid period production directed with panache by Arthur Lubin.
Jack Hazan's shimmeringly beautiful "A Bigger Splash," presented by
the American Cinematheque, is a captivating re-enactment of a crisis
in the life of painter David Hockney in which all involved play
themselves. This 1974 film is at once the record of the artist's
painful loss of a lover and its impact on his work, and a witty
observation of his milieu. The film becomes a homage, emulating the
artist's direct, simple but finally enigmatic style.</TE>

<HD>50 brides flee and comedy ensues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about big fat Greek weddings.</LD>
<LD>   In Charles L. Mee's scintillating comedy "Big Love," 50 modern-day
Greek brides are slated for family-arranged mass matrimony with 50 of
their American cousins. But the young women rebel and flee to an
Italian seaside villa, where they ask for sanctuary.</LD>
<LD>   Mee didn't make up this wacky scenario. It's based on one of the
earliest extant plays, Aeschylus' "The Suppliant Women," in which 50
women seek protection in Greece from their Egyptian would-be grooms.</LD>
<TE>   But Mee transformed his musty inspiration (as well as musings from
11 other writers whom he credits in his script) into wildly funny
reflections on love, men, women and contemporary society that are
strewn throughout a woolly narrative that features music, dance, mass
murder and redemption.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Shapiro's staging for Pacific Resident Theatre seizes the
intermission-less play by the throat and doesn't let go, unfurling a
parade of passionate and intensely physical performances from a fully
committed cast.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately Mee didn't try to tell all 50 of the women's stories.
He focuses on three of the brides: the man-hating Thyona (Katy
Selverstone), the man-appreciating Olympia (Lesley Fera) and Lydia
(Dana Dewes), who is very ambivalent. Soon we meet their three
intendeds: respectively, the machismo-imbued Constantine (Scott
Conte), the enigmatic Oed (Ian Lithgow) and the would-be sensitive
Nikos (Jason Huber).</TE>
<TE>   They have landed on property owned by the suave Piero (Robert
Bailey), who lives with his aged mother (Diane Hurley). Piero's gay
nephew (Alexander Enberg) offers another perspective, as do two house
guests (Hurley and Bailey).</TE>
<TE>   Like Mee's "Wintertime," which premiered last summer at La Jolla
Playhouse, "Big Love" blends a sense of classical rhetoric and a lush
recorded musical score with extreme, over-the-top slapstick. The
young brides and grooms fling themselves to the floor so violently
that one wonders how long it will be before the understudies have to
fill in.</TE>
<TE>   Selverstone and Conte deliver especially fine-tuned rants, but the
dithering in the less extreme roles is also hilarious, as are
Enberg's languors and Hurley's suspenseful account of her old woman's
dozen sons.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Evashchen's simple set, lighted by Younwha Kong, evokes
Mediterranean pleasures, much as the whole play oozes a lusty delight
in probing life's evergreen issues.</TE>

<KH>SINGLE IN THE CITY</KH>
<HD>A lesson in survival from zombies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Samantha Bonar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I hate horror movies, and I hate being alone. Which explains why I
was home alone watching a horror movie on Halloween a couple of years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   The trick-or-treaters had come and gone. Why I thought turning on
"Night of the Living Dead" late in the evening was a good idea, I
can't imagine. This is the girl who had a panic attack in sixth grade
when a classmate simply described "The Exorcist." And I was doubly
wiggy lately, since I'd just broken up with my long-term boyfriend
and he had moved to New York City to attend grad school. It was an
ugly breakup; he had proposed for the second time and I had refused
again. Still, I missed him; it was a fresh wound, and the separation
anxiety was terrible.</LD>
<LD>   "Night of the Living Dead" is the 1968 classic black-and-white
film about zombies who kill and eat the living to survive. A bunch of
twentysomethings take shelter in a farmhouse, where they board up the
windows and doors. If they can survive the night, the hope is that
the zombies will be gone by dawn.</LD>
<TE>   I'd spent many nights lately keeping my own personal demons at
bay. In addition to the breakup, I'd lost my father to cancer a few
months earlier. Trying to make sense of the meaning of his
complicated life made me reassess the direction of my own. I was
plagued by regrets about decisions I'd made in the first 10 years of
adulthood and confusion about how to make better choices in the
coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Should I have married the ex-boyfriend? The question haunted me. I
couldn't fault him in any way, but something was missing. Was my
desire for "something" unrealistic, immature? Would I rather be alone
than with a kind, loving companion? What kind of sense did that make?</TE>
<TE>   Especially when there are horror movies on TV! It's at times like
that when you really need a masculine shoulder to burrow into.</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't turn off "Night of the Living Dead," even though it was
scaring the bejesus out of me. The dog was getting truly annoyed at
the number of times I kept throwing the afghan over our heads on the
couch. But I just had to see if anyone survived.</TE>
<TE>   The movie ended. I loosened my death grip on the remote, turned on
all the lights in the house, looked out all the windows and went to
bed, where I jerked at every small noise. But I made it through the
night. And the next night. And the next. Life went on.</TE>
<TE>   My angst abated. I learned that there are worse things than being
alone. Such as being with someone for whom you have no passion. Or
being with a jerk.</TE>
<TE>   Or having your brain eaten by zombies. Where there is life, there
is hope for a better tomorrow.</TE>

<HD>The bash master tells all</HD>
<DH>The perfect party is an eclectic blend of guests, music,
food and style, says Billy Butchkavitz.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne Valdespino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When he stops to think about it, Billy Butchkavitz has been a party
boy from way back. At 9, he took over the Christmas decorating at his
family's huge Pennsylvania farmhouse. As a teen he planned his own
birthday bashes, complete with poolside decorations, torches, fruit
baskets and fresh flowers on every table. In high school he worked
summers in the banquet department of a resort hotel, where he learned
"all the little things."</LD>
<LD>   You could say his whole life has been leading up to a career as a
professional party planner. He arranges special occasions for society
ladies from Beverly Hills and Brentwood, and big-budget dos for HBO
and other corporate clients.</LD>
<LD>   Between gigs, Butchkavitz -- a surname that even feels like an
event -- talked about his party planning philosophy and how to make a
Halloween bash stylish and surprising without spending a bazillion
bucks.</LD>
<TE>   If you're having people over tonight, quit fretting, he says. Do a
little planning, take the focus and the pressure off yourself, and go
for it. "It's not about me, me, me," he says. "It's all about being a
good host or hostess in the old sense of the word: Make your guests
feel welcome."</TE>
<TE>   But first a little background on Butchkavitz. His sense of party
all started with mom.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom was a little bit of an artist before she got married. She
did window displays for local department stores, and my dad was an
architect. They let us tinker with stuff, and they didn't mind us
making messes."</TE>
<TE>   That's how Butchkavitz, a vegetarian and a teetotaler who
"couldn't cook to save myself," grew up to be the life of the party.
What he lacks in culinary expertise, he more than makes up in style
and hospitality.</TE>
<TE>   And most importantly, don't worry about impressing guests. "Just
be yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Easy for him to say. Butchkavitz looks like an unflappable
party-planning angel sent to smooth over any earthly disaster. His
enormous blue eyes are set in a baby face that's a combination of
young Elton John and Donovan, framed by pale gold curls. In tan
patchwork pants, faded denim shirt and square-toed Palomino boots,
he's got his own laid-back style and a soothing voice that exudes the
subliminal message, "Everything's going to be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Tips from Billy's notebook</TE>
<TE>   The guest list: "It gets so boring if you're all lawyers. Bring in
dancers, college students, artists, the young and the old. It's the
responsibility of the host to entertain the guests and stimulate them
mentally."</TE>
<TE>   The music: "Mix it up. Everything from Luis Miguel to Doris Day.
Put the CD on shuffle and have music in other languages. You don't
want Britney or whatever's on the Top 40. Try to educate guests, not
bore them."</TE>
<TE>   Costumes: "In a little house or cottage, people in big proppy
costumes will knock things over. And some people are intimidated. If
you must, just ask everybody to wear black or some other color. You
can provide a hand-held mask on a stick or bizarre wigs at each place
setting."</TE>
<TE>   Drinks: "You don't have to have a special drink. Dry ice at home
is just annoying. Just do a nice punch with dried leaves and pumpkins
around it."</TE>
<TE>   Snacks: "When I do a party at my house, I get takeout from
different restaurants. It's very eclectic. For Halloween, you could
do weird stuff like snails or chocolate-covered ants, or garnish
trays with the dried fish and shrimp you buy in Chinatown. Or have
shish-kebabs with the skewers stuck into a rubber rat."</TE>
<TE>   Desserts: "I'm a big dessert person. If you have a bakery you
like, get pumpkin cookies. Or just buy slice-and-bake cookies, and
use witch and ghost cookie cutters."</TE>
<TE>   Make it memorable: "Make a punch that goes with your theme. And
when guests come to the door, have it all decorated. That makes an
impact."</TE>
<TE>   Make it stylish: "People do e-vites, but I like real invitations.
They don't have to be expensive. Make them yourself, like little
orange craft-paper pumpkins in green envelopes. And have party
favors. Trick-or-treat bags with something inexpensive."</TE>
<TE>   Make it surprising: "Do something that's not the norm. If your
friends aren't used to having three-course meals, serve salad and
entree separately and have dessert in a different room."</TE>
<TE>   Billy's twist on Halloween</TE>
<TE>   Day of the Dead house party: Use a muslin table cloth, or
painter's canvas on the table, and set out folk-art skeletons, skulls
and candles. No black-and-orange candles, use white or ivory instead.
The colors look better and you can use the candles after the holiday.
Serve snacks like orange-and-black blue corn tortilla chips with
guacamole spooned into a little black plastic caldron.</TE>
<TE>   Gothic dinner: Decorate with tall candles or candelabras and faux
spider webs. Cover everything with white fabric or sheets, the table,
the chairs -- make it look like an eerie, abandoned house. You can
get a spooky look by putting fabric over lamp shades. And have lots
of candlelight. Surprise guests by setting a formal table and then
serving burgers and fries.</TE>
<TE>   Retro bash: Do the hokey '60s thing with plastic pumpkins. And for
your buffet table, drag out the big galvanized tub -- as if you're
bobbing for apples -- but fill it with apples and floating candles.
Or stock it with ice, sodas and Coronas, so you're bobbing for
drinks. Use plastic pumpkins filled with fresh flowers or candy
treats placed around the house. Make caramel apples studded with
candy corn, and serve vintage kiddie treats: cracker jacks,
mini-candy bars, wax fangs. Have a special beverage to match the
apple decor: green apple martinis or cider for people who don't
drink.</TE>

<HD>Troupe thrives on adversity</HD>
<DH>Kirov Opera gracefully clears hurdles in L.A. for
triumphant 'Lady Macbeth.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Friday at noon, several winning young Russian singers from the
Kirov Opera gathered on a small makeshift stage on the Santa Monica
pier to offer a concert for all who happened by. It was unusual, but
not unpleasant, to hear opera at the beach. The weather, threatening
rain, was also unusual but far more comfortable and suitable to
intense Russian emotion than bright sunshine would have been.</LD>
<LD>   After the company's exciting first performance of Shostakovich's
"Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion last week,
a dark cloud over the Kirov's L.A. tour had finally lifted. Now the
cloud was back but held at bay. Not long after the concert on the
pier, it began to rain.</LD>
<LD>   Call it luck, if you like. But better to call it conviction. Keep
at it, and things will sooner or later average out. And no company in
the world keeps at it like the Kirov.</LD>
<TE>   Originally the Los Angeles Opera had planned on the Kirov bringing
the Prokofiev epic, "War and Peace," for the full company's first Los
Angeles visit, but budget overruns and uncertain sponsorship forced a
substitution for the $1 million-cheaper Shostakovich opera. "War and
Peace" was scheduled for seven performances in seven days, but most
of the large cast have small roles that can be sung day after day
without rest. "Lady Macbeth" has several killer roles, and at least
four which required triple casting, although the ever plucky Kirov
found multiple casts for nine.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the Los Angeles dock lockout, which prevented the
sets from being unloaded before the freighter headed to Tokyo,
leaving a frantic 10 days during which to build new ones from
Russian-language blueprints. On top of all that, the company's
indefatigable leader, the conductor, Valery Gergiev, was pushing it,
even for him. Flying in Tuesday afternoon from Austria, where he had
conducted the Vienna Philharmonic the night before, Gergiev allowed
himself a window of only a couple of hours before a single dress
rehearsal Tuesday for all the casts. The free hour between arriving
at the Los Angeles house in which he was a guest and heading for the
Music Center, he agreed to spend with this writer.</TE>
<TE>   Looking exhausted -- although insisting that music never makes him
tired, only stupid people do -- he mustered his remaining energy to
promote all the goings-on at the Mariinsky Theatre back home in St.
Petersburg. It is a cultural glory of the new Russia. President
Vladimir V. Putin, a native of St. Petersburg, is a fan of the
company and regularly attends with visiting dignitaries, including
President George W. Bush, whether they are opera lovers or not.</TE>
<TE>   And what this company does, as it demonstrated at its Los Angeles
appearances, is put on opera with every bit of energy it can muster.
Obstacles are to be overcome -- "I solve crises all the time, what's
the big deal?" Gergiev says, flicking his hand as if to ward off a
meaningless insect. It is a company that never stops. In Tokyo next
month, the company is scheduled to perform the five-hour "War and
Peace" twice in a single day.</TE>
<TE>   There were no stars on this tour. And in a perfect operatic world,
the young and seductive Katerina, the Russian Lady Macbeth, would not
be middle-aged and stocky as she sometimes was here. But there wasn't
a single singer in the three casts I heard that wasn't alive to the
score and stage.</TE>
<TE>   I was particularly struck by Larissa Gogolevskaya, the Katerina I
heard on Tuesday. She doesn't look the part but she proved an ardent
actress and a thrilling vocal laser beam. Likewise the dashing, young
Oleg Balashov, a Sergei I heard at the second performance, was a
perfect example of the young performers whom Gergiev tirelessly
discovers, develops at warp-speed and immediately launches -- none of
this waiting for years in the wings as at other opera houses.</TE>
<TE>   Gergiev, who never stays still for long, was already on the road
again Monday, and Maxim Shostakovich conducted the last two
performances. By Tuesday night he had the orchestra playing with
breathtaking brilliance. The composer's son may not convey the
dramatic intensity or deep soul of Gergiev, but he brought a stunning
clarity to the musical design. Brisk and loud, he pushed the singers
to shout occasionally, but again the effect was only one of added
enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night the company also pulled a trick on the audience.
Instead of one police sergeant there were two slyly sharing the role
(the night before, there were two shabby peasants instead of one).
Such is the phenomenal combination of eagerness, professionalism and
mischief that makes this unstoppable company utterly irresistible.
Triumph over adversity in Los Angeles is all in a long day's work.</TE>

<LD>It's Halloween, and Dracula is scaring up tourist dollars in Romania.
But the truly haunting segment in tonight's edition of the PBS
magazine show "Frontline/World" (9 p.m., KCET) takes place on the
other side of the globe, deep in the Cambodian jungle, where the
Khmer Rouge still strikes fear.</LD>
<LD>   This "Frontline" spinoff departs from the original's single-topic
format -- a welcome departure from the "news" magazines obsessed with
the adulterous murder plot of the week.</LD>
<LD>   Hosting a bittersweet travelogue, expatriate Romanian poet Andrei
Codrescu returns to his homeland. He finds vibrancy in hip-hop
artists and defiant Gypsy musicians, yet something eerie in the new
breed of entrepreneur running Dracula-themed restaurants and training
women to be exotic dancers.</LD>
<TE>   In another segment, Amanda Pike finds unrepentant former leaders
of the Khmer Rouge, whose reign of terror in the '70s left 2 million
Cambodians dead. Pol Pot's deputy, Nuon Chea, says, "Just because you
did something wrong doesn't mean you're a bad person."</TE>
<TE>   The scary thing about the face of evil is its ordinariness.</TE>

<HD>Urban invasion</HD>
<DH>Space Invaders, which dot city streets in Europe and Asia,
have also landed in Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shana Ting Lipton</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Space is the final frontier for some but just the beginning for one
anonymous French artist. This stealth figure is the mastermind behind
a renegade global street art project that has planted its tentacles
everywhere from Amsterdam to Hong Kong, including Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Remember those monster icons from the '70s Space Invaders video
games? This artist does, with fanatic reverence, creating an
artwork-game variation -- also called Space Invaders -- that has
invaded many public spaces, much to the chagrin of local authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Invader, as he calls himself, makes tile square "replicas" of the
arcade creatures and goes around the world affixing them to
buildings, pillars, curbs, you name it. He's well known in Paris,
where he started his work in the late '90s, hitting major monuments
like the Louvre. In the City of Light, he boasts a massive 384
"invasions," scattered through the city. His L.A. score is a less
impressive 41.</LD>
<TE>   "The Hollywood sign was the hottest to me," he says. His Web site,
www.space-invaders.com/som.html, features documentation of this
infamous hit, chronicling how the tiles found their way into a
restricted area. He also placed the tile creatures in more accessible
public locations, such as a street invasion on La Cienega Boulevard
just north of Olympic Boulevard. Another trip to L.A., for a second
wave of hits, is in the works.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere along the way, what started as an iconographic solo
project has turned into an offbeat sociological phenomenon. Other
people have begun contributing to the project, adding tiles to
existing hits.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of involving people is part of my future evolution, but
until now I have worked alone," says the artist, who has seen
interest in his Space Invaders mushroom. He sells invasion kits on
his Web site, which include one handmade tile and instructions on how
to invade. Though the product is offered under the premise of art
collecting, it also seems to be a provocation to take action.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based designer-musician Jennifer Quinn bought one of
his tiles for $100 but has chosen to display hers on the outside wall
of her home. Space Invaders has also inspired Quinn to tap into her
own creativity. "I made one for my dad for his birthday," she says.</TE>
<TE>   So, what is Space Invaders really about? Is it civilized graffiti?
A personal way of marking one's territory? Or a public display of
obsessive-compulsive disorder? If one could hover in a spaceship
looking down on this awesome, mazelike city, perhaps the answer would
be clear.</TE>
<TE>   In Invader's words: "The purpose is the invasion. The game is the
reality."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Invader was here</TE>
<TE>   Clues on where to look for</TE>
<TE>   Space Invaders</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood sign: 6342 Mulholland Highway in Griffith Park. Some
letters are "tagged."</TE>
<TE>   Near Los Angeles County Museum of Art: 5905 Wilshire Blvd.; the
cross street is Spaulding Avenue. Check out the curb.</TE>
<TE>   Boulevard hits: Look for the La Cienega Boulevard invader between
Olympic and Wilshire boulevards, on the street divider next to La
Cienega Park.</TE>

<TE>   Ben Affleck tries to squeeze into Harrison Ford's mighty shoes as
CIA hero Jack Ryan in a nuclear thriller based on Tom Clancy's
bestseller.</TE>
<TE>   In this outing, adequately directed by Phil Alden Robinson, a
coltish Ryan finds himself embroiled in a plot to lure Americans and
Russians into a nuclear standoff. Morgan Freeman is on hand.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes a pat "making of" featurette and a
more informative mini-documentary on the various special effects.
Robinson and cinematographer John Lindley provide a technical
commentary track.</TE>
<TE>   The more story-minded can listen to Robinson and executive
producer Clancy. The author, though, comes off as a pompous snob with
a crass sense of humor.</TE>

<TE>   Universal, $30</TE>
<TE>   Even though the DVDs of Steven Spielberg's films usually are
entertaining, the lack of a commentary track from the director keeps
the discs from soaring out of the stratosphere. Nevertheless, fans of
his 1982 classic "E.T." should still enjoy the new two-disc set of
this children's fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   The first disc includes the 2002 version of the film, which
features previously unseen footage and enhanced special effects; an
introduction by Spielberg; and an entertaining look at the planets.</TE>
<TE>   The second disc features the original theatrical version; a
documentary featuring tons of vintage behind-the-scenes footage and
new interviews with the cast and crew; and fun DVD-ROM features.</TE>

<TE>   Down by Law</TE>
<TE>   Tom Waits, John Lurie, Roberto  Benigni</TE>
<TE>   Criterion, $40</TE>
<TE>   Two years after his successful indie hit "Stranger Than Paradise,"
Jim Jarmusch wrote and directed this equally quirky 1986 comedy,
beautifully shot in black-and-white by Robby Muller.</TE>
<TE>   Waits and Lurie play losers from New Orleans who find themselves
stuck in a jail cell together. Their life is turned upside-down when
an excitable Italian (an adorable Roberto Benigni, in his first
American film) joins them in their cell. The three of them escape and
end up the Louisiana swamp.</TE>
<TE>   The two-disc set features a beautiful new high-definition digital
transfer, sly thoughts and reflections from Jarmusch, several
outtakes, a 1986 taped television interview with Lurie, a recent
interview with Muller, production Polaroids, a Q&amp;A with Jarmusch in
which he answers questions posed by the film's fans, and recordings
of candid phone conversations between Jarmusch and his three stars.</TE>

<LD>The Shortlist Prize for Artistic Achievement in Music is out to
rectify years of Grammy frustration, and as it attempts to become an
American analogue to the British Mercury Music Prize, the Shortlist
might one day actually boost the fortunes of critically acclaimed
releases that struggle to sell.</LD>
<LD>   But its live showcase needs to be shored up a bit. Despite some
inspiring performances, Tuesday's second annual awards presentation
at the Henry Fonda Theatre had the deadly pace of an industry
rubber-chicken banquet.</LD>
<LD>   The show, which began nearly an hour late, opened with
singer-songwriter Cody Chesnutt, whose soulful, raggedly eccentric
folk echoed Gil Scott-Heron and Ted Hawkins. Chesnutt was amusing and
intermittently beguiling, but he seemed an odd choice for an opener
-- an experimental short before an Adam Sandler movie.</LD>
<TE>   Cee-Lo, the dissident from the Atlanta hip-hop act Goodie Mob who
went solo this year with his own album, turned in an invigoratingly
ambitious set. Backed by a live band (hip-hop's most encouraging new
trend), Cee-Lo was both vaudevillian and lover man, using his
impressive tools as a rapper and singer to range freely across
styles.</TE>
<TE>   The evening ground to a halt when writer Toure read from his book
of short stories while rapper Mos Def provided musical accompaniment.
DJ Shadow rectified things with his set, an abbreviated version of
the show he brought to the Mayan Theatre earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   N.E.R.D., the hip-hop band that won the Shortlist for its terrific
album "No One Ever Really Dies," didn't make a strong claim for the
award. The band's co-leader, Pharell Williams, was annoyingly
long-winded, cutting off promising songs to disingenuously fulminate
against the music business. (Can an artist who remixes Britney Spears
really rail against the industry?)</TE>
<TE>   It took an elder to show the kids in N.E.R.D. how to really move a
crowd. Backed by two members of Swedish band the Hives, Pete Yorn on
drums and Mike Watt on bass, Iggy Pop belted out three Stooges
classics with dispatch and showed up the other acts in no time flat.</TE>

<LD>Yoshimoto reads colleagues' faces</LD>
<LD>   This is a significant season for local artist Hiroko Yoshimoto,
gearing up for a retrospective at the Ventura County Museum of Art
and History starting early in December. But for the moment, the big
news in Yoshimoto's world is a new show of art very much about
artists, in the main gallery of the Buenaventura Art Gallery.</LD>
<LD>   Her series of largish, abidingly sensitive portraits goes by the
title "Face to Face: Artists' Gaze," which says much about the work.
With this series, Yoshimoto has paid patient visits to area artists,
who peer back at us in the painter's mode of stylized realism. It
seems that she's trying to capture something concrete -- the gaze of
the artist -- and something less tangible, a probing spirit essential
to art that counts.</LD>
<TE>   Many of these works put a face on names that have paraded through
area galleries, some of them for many years. That list would include
Yoshimoto herself, who appears in a self-portrait, in the most
neutral, curious gaze in the gallery, brush in hand. She seems to
have gauged appropriate settings for each artist, often against
backdrops of their own work. That same tack has been pursued in the
ongoing series of photographic portraits in the "Focus on the
Masters" series by Donna Granata, a former student of Yoshimoto, here
presented against a flat red background.</TE>
<TE>   On one wall is a fittingly tall, generous portrait of Gerd Koch,
an engaging post-abstract expressionist painter and Yoshimoto's
former colleague in the Ventura College art department.</TE>
<TE>   Another colleague, Connie Jenkins, is paid tribute, and Shirley
Ransom is seen as a beaming presence against a spare background. That
effect contrasts with the earthy abstract setting behind rugged
blond-maned sculptor/Art City founder Paul Lindhard, or the intensity
of Maribel Hernandez's gaze.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Yoshimoto's impressive portraits of the artists
celebrate their diversity. They also let us glimpse the personae
behind some of the art we see in the region.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A chorale's silvery season</TE>
<TE>   Los Robles Master Chorale, boldly led by James Stemen, has been a
fixture on Ventura County's musical scene for many a moon. In its
history so far, it has included guest appearances by Roger Wagner,
Sir David Wilcocks and current Los Angeles Master Chorale director
Paul Salamunovich.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it may come as a surprise to some in denial about time's
passing that this weekend kicks off the 25th anniversary season for a
choral group that began its life as the Moorpark Master Chorale and
has been, along with the Ventura County Master Chorale, a brave
champion of choral tradition in these parts. The exclamation-pointed
"Pure Sterling!" season begins Saturday and Sunday with Mendelssohn's
oratorio "Elijah."</TE>
<TE>   Coming up later in the season are Handel's "Messiah" and other
Christmas seasonal sounds (Dec. 7 and 8); Orff's lusty war horse
"Carmina Burana," in conjunction with the Santa Barbara Chorale
Society (March 8); Beethoven's Ninth, in cahoots with the New West
Symphony (May 16 and 17); and a reprise of "Carmina Burana" at
Carnegie Hall in New York City.</TE>

that delighted liberals. He supported busing to end school
segregation, stricter regulation of gun owners, enhanced protection
for victims of sexual discrimination and a woman's right to choose
abortion.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities regulators, moving to implement regulations ordered by
Congress after a wave of business scandals, Wednesday proposed rules
to crack down on pro forma profit reports and off-balance-sheet
dealings.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, voting 5 to 0 on all
measures, also sent out for public comment a proposed rule to bar
executives from selling company stock when employees are unable to do
so because of pension plan "blackout periods."</LD>
<LD>   But the agency postponed until Wednesday action on a proposed rule
to require corporate lawyers to blow the whistle on securities
lawbreaking found on the job. SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt said his
staff needed more time to write the rule.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC is working to effect provisions of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act
approved in July by Congress in reaction to this year's torrent of
corporate and accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The pro forma reporting rule attacks the problem of companies
reporting profit figures that ignore various costs, departing from
nationally recognized standards known as generally accepted
accounting principles, or GAAP.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed rule, companies no longer could report
financial results on a pro forma basis without explaining how they
differed from GAAP-based results.</TE>
<TE>   The pro forma rule also would result in companies having to file
news releases and announcements that contain "material" financial
information to the SEC on the existing 8K form, exposing companies to
greater legal liability on their public pronouncements.</TE>
<TE>   The off-balance-sheet rule would require companies to talk about
any off-balance-sheet financial obligations, and the risks that they
could pose, in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section of
filings made to the commission.</TE>

<HD>Judge OKs Kmart Deal to Sell Its Web Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday approved discount retailer Kmart
Corp.'s deal to sell its Bluelight.com Internet access unit, after
Kmart resolved issues raised by Microsoft Corp. and three states
concerning software licenses and taxation.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Susan Pierson Sonderby overruled an
objection from Kmart's lenders, led by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., which
had asked that proceeds from the $8.4-million sale be set aside
instead of going directly to Kmart.</LD>
<LD>   Software giant Microsoft and others filed objections last week to
the proposed sale of Bluelight.com's Internet access business to
United Online Inc., citing software licensing and tax issues. United
Online is based in Westlake Village.</LD>
<TE>   Some of Kmart's lenders and the states of Illinois, Washington and
California also objected to the deal, which was announced in
September.</TE>
<TE>   Bluelight.com, which consists of the Internet service provider and
Kmart's e-commerce Web site, was valued at about $80 million in
August 2001 for the combined company.</TE>
<TE>   Subscribers to the service once numbered 7 million, but have
dwindled to about 165,000. Kmart, which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in January, is selling only the Internet
service assets.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, Microsoft had objected to the deal
because it said Kmart had not specifically identified which Microsoft
software licenses it planned to transfer to United Online as part of
the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois and Washington objected because they said Kmart was
seeking exemption from various local and state taxes.</TE>

<HD>State to Launch 2nd Phase in Power Bond Sale</HD>
<DH>Brokerages will begin taking individuals' orders Friday for
the $6.75-billion offering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brokerages will begin taking orders Friday from small investors who
want to buy some of the power bonds California will sell next week.</LD>
<LD>   The offering is expected to attract investors who are hungry for
decent yields, with rates on U.S. Treasury securities near 40-year
lows, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   In the second phase of the biggest municipal bond deal in history,
the state will offer $6.75 billion of tax-exempt fixed-rate bonds.</LD>
<TE>   Institutional investors, such as mutual funds, will bid for the
bonds next week, most likely Tuesday, bankers said. Small investors'
orders will be taken before the institutional orders, from Friday
through Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The deal will complete a mammoth $11.9-billion bond offering, the
proceeds of which will repay loans from banks and the state's general
fund that helped the state purchase power during the energy crisis of
2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds are being sold by the state's Department of Water
Resources.</TE>
<TE>   Customers of the state's major utilities will pay off the bonds
through surcharges on their utility bills for the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, institutional investors snapped up $4.25 billion of
adjustable-rate power bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The fixed-rate bonds will be offered in maturities from two to 20
years, with tax-free yields expected to range from about 2% on the
shortest terms to about 5.5% on the longest terms, analysts said. The
securities will be sold in $5,000 minimums.</TE>
<TE>   "We think interest from individual investors will be very high in
this deal, given the troubles in the equity market and the lack of
supply of California long-term municipal bonds this year, said Nathan
Brostrom, a vice president with J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;  Co. "However,
since this is a complex deal, it's important that investors read the
prospectus and understand the risks inherent in buying a bond like
this."</TE>
<TE>   Although rated investment grade by Wall Street credit-rating
agencies, the bond deal has been delayed by political wrangling and
legal hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Interested buyers can find the bond prospectus on the state
treasurer's Web site, www.treasurer.ca.gov. But purchases must be
made through brokers. There are 32 investment firms selling the
bonds, including J.P. Morgan Chase; Stone &amp; Youngberg; Bear, Stearns
&amp; Co.; Morgan Stanley; Siebert Brandford Shank &amp; Co.; and Salomon
Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   Bond buyers would have to open a brokerage account if they don't
have one already, bankers said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the yields will be exempt from state and federal income
taxes for California residents, the true returns on the bonds will be
higher, depending on an investor's tax bracket.</TE>
<TE>   A tax-free yield of 4%, for example, is equivalent to a fully
taxable yield (such as on a bank CD) of about 6% for a taxpayer in
the combined 33.8% federal and state tax bracket.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated $3.75 billion of the $6.75 billion of fixed-rate
bonds sold next week will be insured, meaning they will be guaranteed
against default with the backing of bond insurance firms. The insured
bonds are expected to pay slightly lower yields than the uninsured
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "My very conservative investors are even interested in the
uninsured portion," said Zane Mann, publisher of the California
Municipal Bond Advisor newsletter in Palm Springs. "We've had a lot
of calls from interested investors."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the bond underwriters will release an estimate of
yields for each of the maturities, Brostrom said. If, when the bonds
are finally priced next week, the yields differ from the estimates,
investors who placed orders won't be obligated to buy the bonds.</TE>

<HD>Catellus Profit Falls 49% on Decrease in Property Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Catellus Development Corp., one of California's largest landowners
and builders, said Wednesday that third-quarter profit fell 49% from
a year earlier as property sales decreased.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Catellus made $14.7 million, or 16 cents a
share, compared with $28.6 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The profit decline was expected because the company intentionally
accelerated sales during the first half of the year.</LD>
<TE>   "They made a decision to push sales into the first half of 2002,"
said Jim Sullivan, an analyst at Green Street Advisors. "Real estate
prices were at high levels and the fundamentals were declining. It
was a wise choice."</TE>
<TE>   Catellus reported $10.3 million in sales of buildings and land in
the quarter, down from $64.3 million the year before. Revenue from
Catellus' rental properties rose 13%, to $66 million.</TE>
<TE>   Income from property sales and fee services in the fourth quarter
are expected to be about the same as the third quarter, said Catellus
Chairman Nelson Rising. The firm expects earnings per share to grow
15% this year, to $2, depending on the timing of sales.</TE>
<TE>   Catellus, the former real estate division of Santa Fe Pacific
Railroad, owns 36.5 million square feet of rental properties and has
one of the largest supplies of undeveloped land in the Western U.S.,
capable of supporting more than 39 million square feet of commercial
development and 10,400 residential lots and units. It also owns Union
Station in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the land sales this year have been residential sites the
company owns in southeast Orange County, suburban Sacramento and the
Bay Area, Rising said.</TE>
<TE>   Catellus shares rose 15 cents Wednesday to $17.40 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The firm announced its earnings after the markets
closed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Citigroup to Separate Operations</HD>
<DH>A new research and brokerage unit is aimed at eliminating
potential conflicts of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc., which has been at the center of government probes
into alleged Wall Street misconduct, said Wednesday it will create a
new unit to house its stock research and retail brokerage operations,
and has hired a well-respected executive to run the division.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise move is aimed at eliminating the potential conflicts
of interest that have sparked multiple government investigations of
Wall Street's practices in the late 1990s, Citigroup said.</LD>
<LD>   The unit, which will include more than 300 analysts and 12,500
brokers, will be headed by Sallie L. Krawcheck, a onetime stock
analyst who had been running Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., a highly
regarded independent research firm.</LD>
<TE>   Krawcheck, 37, will report to Sanford Weill, Citigroup's chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Citigroup's research and brokerage chiefs answered to
the head of the firm's Salomon Smith Barney investment banking unit.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state probes of brokerage practices during the bull
market have shown that analysts at major firms, including Salomon,
say they felt pressured to hype stocks to help their bankers win
fee-rich corporate-financing business.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this model of splitting off the [brokerage] business and
the research product from the rest of the investment bank, and
bringing in somebody who's had an incredibly long success record ...
is a major advantage," Weill said in an interview at the financial
services giant's Park Avenue headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators have struggled in recent months with reform ideas that
would insulate analysts from banking pressure. Major brokerages have
been in intense talks with regulators over the last few weeks to
reach a "global" settlement involving reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators initially considered forcing the companies to spin off
their research units into stand-alone firms. But brokerages argued
that analysis by itself is unprofitable, and regulators feared that a
complete separation would reduce the amount and quality of research.</TE>
<TE>   However, critics say that placing research under a new corporate
designation within the same firm is only a cosmetic gesture.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup on Wednesday stopped short of implementing more dramatic
changes that some critics say are needed, such as banning all
interaction between analysts and bankers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this is a big structural reform," said John Coffee,
a Columbia University securities-law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's brokerage and research units would technically remain
part of Salomon Smith Barney. But the brokerage and research
operation would use the name Smith Barney, dropping the Salomon
reference.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup did not go further in its reforms because it doesn't
want to "jump out ahead" of whatever industry-wide reforms regulators
may eventually order, Krawcheck said.</TE>
<TE>   Her unit would be funded by fees, such as commissions, generated
by individual and institutional investors, and would be profitable on
its own, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Krawcheck has been lauded as head of Bernstein, which has no
investment bankers. She covered brokerages for Bernstein before being
named head of research in 1999, then CEO in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's announcement came as major Wall Street firms told
regulators Wednesday that they agree in theory with a proposal that
they subsidize the research of independent firms and offer it to
their own customers, in addition to in-house research.</TE>
<TE>   That plan was floated by regulators last week. However, several
firms said Wednesday that they won't consent to a deal until they
know how much they would have to pay in both fines and subsidies,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators and lawyers for the major firms will meet this morning
to discuss details.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, by taking the initiative Wednesday, hopes to remove the
cloud of scandal that has tainted its image and helped drive its
shares sharply lower. The stock gained 58 cents to $37.08 on the New
York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Though all of Wall Street has been scrutinized, Citigroup has been
under an especially intense glare and has anxiously sought a
settlement with regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon in the late 1990s was a leading underwriter of telecom
stocks, many of which left investors with enormous losses. The firm's
former star telecom analyst, Jack Grubman, was one of the sector's
biggest cheerleaders. He resigned in August.</TE>
<TE>   Weill and other Citigroup executives also have come under the
microscope personally. New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer is probing
whether Weill pressured Grubman or other analysts to talk up certain
stocks. Weill has denied wrongdoing.</TE>

<HD>Corona Plans to Seize Edison's Power Lines</HD>
<DH>Utility is expected to fight if the city invokes its right
of eminent domain to take over distribution system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated with the high rates being charged by Southern California
Edison Co., the city of Corona is expected to announce plans today to
take over the distribution of electricity within its boundaries by
seizing control of power lines from the big utility, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Corona Assistant City Manager Beth Groves would confirm Wednesday
only that the city would make an announcement regarding the city's
fledgling energy distribution system.</LD>
<LD>   But people familiar with the proposal said top city officials
huddled Wednesday to finalize plans for a utility takeover, in which
the city would use its power of eminent domain to condemn at least a
portion of Edison's power lines and substations. If that works -- it
probably would carry an enormous price tag -- Corona effectively
would take control of power distribution within its city limits.</LD>
<TE>   The move could mark the first large, full-fledged municipal
utility created since Sacramento formed one in 1947, and the first of
any size since 1983, when tiny Needles took similar steps, said Jerry
Jordan, executive director of the Sacramento-based California
Municipal Utilities Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The main hitch in the plan: "The system is not for sale," said
Edison spokesman Charley Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Corona would be forced to use its power of eminent
domain -- which probably would drive the case into the courts and
ratchet up the cost. Another city investigating the possibility of
taking over a power distribution operation recently discovered that
the cost would approach $500 million, Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It does surprise me a little bit because of the extraordinary
cost burden that it places city residents under if they choose to go
that route," Wilson said. "It is very complicated. It is very time
consuming. And it is very expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Corona's plan is the latest development in the tense fallout from
the California electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001, when wholesale
prices soared and rolling blackouts claimed everything from
restaurant refrigerators to traffic lights.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses in Corona, which is in western Riverside County, have
been complaining about Edison's rates and quality of service,
according to a filing the city made last month with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission. Some companies have threatened to move
to cities that have their own utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Corona has been involved in a bitter back-and-forth with Edison, a
unit of Rosemead-based Edison International, since April 2001, when
the city formed its own power utility and announced plans to
construct a 65-megawatt plant, primarily to serve Golden Cheese Co.
of California, a local maker of cheeses such as cheddar and Monterey
jack.</TE>
<TE>   Corona's plans foundered, however, when another potential power
customer, the California Department of Water Resources, declined to
take part. The city did begin buying bulk power, similar to the steps
taken by the City of Industry, and distributes electricity to about
50 business customers today, mostly large manufacturing operations,
according to Corona's Groves.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they still can't distribute enough power to the
cheese company because Edison has refused to build a connection
between the company and the power grid.</TE>
<TE>   Edison has alleged that the transaction would be illegal, and
Corona recently filed a complaint over that issue with FERC.</TE>
<TE>   About three-quarters of Californians pay their electric bills to
massive, investor-owned utilities such as Edison and Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co. But about a quarter of state residents pay their bills
to government agencies that run their own utilities, such as the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   The state constitution guarantees the right of municipalities to
deliver power to their residents. That effectively gives Corona the
legal right to use eminent domain to take over electrical
distribution, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   There are 30 municipal utilities in California, 12 of them in
Southern California, Jordan said. Seven of the 30 are more than a
century old, including a utility in Anaheim built in 1895, and all
but five were built before 1950.</TE>
<TE>   But the energy crisis has renewed interest among local government
agencies in reclaiming their destiny from corporate giants, Jordan
said.</TE>
<TE>   During the power crisis, for example, the City of Industry crafted
a deal with Edison to tap into the power grid and supply power to a
new 400-acre industrial park.</TE>
<TE>   Through that pact, the City of Industry began buying bulk power on
the open market last year, then transmitting it through Edison's
system for a fee. The power is supplied via cables owned by the City
of Industry -- which charges 30% less than Edison does, Industry's
Public Works Director John Ballas said.</TE>
<TE>   City of Industry officials say they made the city more competitive
because of the potential savings to manufacturing operations there.
"It's not intended to be a profit center for the city," Ballas said.
"The main purpose is to pass along the savings to the customers."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego and Fresno counties and the cities of San Marcos and
Cerritos, among others, are investigating whether it's possible to
strike out on their own, Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a huge amount of interest," he said. "There is a lot of
concern all over that they would like to have control of their
electricity future and not be subject to the whims of the market. A
lot of local elected officials and citizens looked at [the energy
crisis] and said they'd be a lot better off if they made the
decisions themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of cities are exploring whether they can take over any
facets of electrical distribution, and officials are bracing for a
wave of utility secession movements similar to Corona's, said Tony
Braun, a Sacramento attorney who represents the California Municipal
Utilities Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the legal authority to do it," Braun said. "It's a
question of economics. I imagine we'll see this again in the future."</TE>

<HD>Dynegy Posts $1.8-Billion Loss</HD>
<DH>Charges in third quarter are mainly noncash items related
to energy trading. Some analysts think firm may file for bankruptcy
protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. on Wednesday reported a staggering $1.8-billion loss for
the third quarter, largely reflecting noncash charges related to the
disintegrating energy trading business.</LD>
<LD>   The loss for the Houston energy company, a major power plant
operator in California, also highlighted how few healthy businesses
Dynegy still operates. Analysts speculated that Dynegy soon may join
its former cross-town rival and onetime acquisition target, Enron
Corp., in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't see what Dynegy can do to right the ship," said Gordon
Howald, an energy analyst with Credit Lyonnais. "These guys are in a
vortex and I don't see how they get out of it."</LD>
<TE>   Dynegy, which two weeks ago announced it would exit the energy
trading business to conserve cash amid the industry downturn, also
said it is negotiating with San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco Corp.
to end contracts under which Dynegy markets the natural gas that
ChevronTexaco produces in the contiguous 48 states. ChevronTexaco
owns 26.5% of Dynegy and is expected to write off some or all of that
$2-billion investment when it reports earnings today.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco plans to form a trading unit to take over the
marketing of the company's natural gas if it can reach an agreement
with Dynegy to terminate the contracts, ChevronTexaco spokesman Fred
Gorell said.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy Chief Executive Bruce Williamson, who joined the company
last week, said the third quarter was difficult but added that
Dynegy's $1.75 billion in after-tax charges "did not and will not
affect the company's liquidity position, which remains at a level
that is sufficient to operate our businesses and meet our customer
commitments."</TE>
<TE>   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Dynegy posted a net loss of $1.8
billion, or $4.92 a share, compared with net income of $286 million,
or 85 cents, in the same quarter last year.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter revenue was $1.7 billion, down from $2.3 billion.
Both numbers reflect an industrywide accounting change that requires
traders to book only the net profit from trades rather than the gross
value. Without the accounting change, third-quarter revenue would
have been 82% higher.</TE>
<TE>   After the earnings report was issued, Dynegy shares fell 12 cents,
or roughly 13%, to close at 79 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Charges for the quarter included $908 million for impairment of
goodwill at Dynegy's wholesale energy business, reflecting a loss of
value in the business because of low power prices and Dynegy's
decision to exit trading.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other major charges were $566 million for the loss on
the sale of its biggest pipeline, Northern Natural Gas, and $145
million in reserves taken on the company's power portfolio to reflect
reduced market liquidity.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few bright spots in the earnings report was the
performance of Illinois Power, Dynegy's regulated utility. Illinois
Power earned $36 million during the quarter, up from $26 million in
the period a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy's power plants, including several in California, earned $44
million in the quarter, down from $187 million, because of lower
power prices and a sharp drop in power sales to California under a
contract that allows the state to refuse power it does not need.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy warned investors to expect more charges in the fourth
quarter because it is firing 14% of its work force, restructuring its
business and re-auditing its financial results back to 1999.</TE>

<HD>Suit May Block DirecTV Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unimpressed by some last-minute concessions, state and federal
antitrust officials are expected today to file suit to block the
proposed marriage between EchoStar Communications Corp. and its
satellite-TV rival Hughes Electronics Corp., according to sources
close to the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Executives from DirecTV, which is owned by Hughes, and EchoStar
met Monday with Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles James and offered to
give up some of their satellite frequencies to New York-based
Cablevision Systems Corp., which wants to launch a rival satellite-TV
service.</LD>
<LD>   But antitrust officials, including state representatives from
Missouri, New York and Connecticut, continue to believe the
EchoStar-DirecTV merger would reduce competition and harm consumers.
"They got a very bad reception from both Justice [Department] and the
states," according to a source familiar with the meeting. "States
considered it a nonstarter and the Feds were highly skeptical."</LD>
<TE>   James skipped a follow-up meeting Tuesday with Cablevision
officials, who attempted to show how their new service might restore
competition in the satellite-TV market after the merger, a source
said. "We remain optimistic that the government will accept the
proposed solution, which addresses every concern relating to
competition," a Cablevision spokesman said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission blocked the merger this
month, leaving most analysts to conclude that the deal is not
salvageable.</TE>
<TE>   An EchoStar spokesman declined to comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar fell 17 cents to $19.82
on Nasdaq. Shares of El Segundo-based Hughes, a unit of General
Motors Corp., dropped 25 cents to $9.77 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Internet Retailing Is Growing Into a State of Maturity</HD>
<DH>And Along With It Comes a Flattening Out of Growth</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The good news for electronic commerce is that it isn't just for
tech-savvy shoppers anymore. The bad news is that e-commerce
merchants are now at the mercy of the same economic factors that are
battering traditional retailers.</LD>
<LD>   Online sales in the third quarter totaled $17.9 billion, according
to a report this week from ComScore Networks Inc., a market research
firm in Reston, Va. That's just a 2.3% boost from the previous
three-month period, and summer is traditionally a slow time for
retail. Last year, autumn sales were 6.4% higher than summer sales.</LD>
<LD>   Those figures suggest that e-commerce is reaching a plateau -- and
that growth will be more difficult to come by. To make matters worse,
analysts say that online merchants are unlikely to outperform general
retailers in what is expected to be a less than stellar holiday
season.</LD>
<TE>   "In the early years, the online shoppers tended to be a lot more
tech-savvy," said Michelle David Adams, vice president of retail at
ComScore. "Now online shopping is much more mainstream. Online
consumer shopping has become a very, very strong predictor of
consumer shopping as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   After years of triple-digit increases, e-commerce growth is
slowing in year-to-year comparisons. First-quarter sales for 2002
were 48% greater than in 2001, while second-quarter sales rose 40%
and third-quarter sales grew by 35%.</TE>
<TE>   No longer able to rely on novelty for continued growth, major
online retailers are now trying to mine territory they had previously
dismissed as too challenging. For example, industry bellwether
Amazon.com Inc. is putting the finishing touches on a plan to open a
virtual store to sell clothing.</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle-based company would not comment on the venture, which
has been anticipated since the summer. But Kate Delhagen, retail
research director for Forrester Research, said she has been told by
participating merchants that the launch is imminent so that Amazon
can reap the benefits of holiday shopping -- such as they may be.</TE>
<TE>   "Amazon has been making a very predictable march across all retail
categories," Delhagen said. "First came the easy-to-purchase online
items like books and CDs and in the next wave came heavier, more
problematic things such as home electronics."</TE>
<TE>   But selling apparel has been thought to be even a bigger challenge
for online retailers. Total sales of clothing online are expected to
rise to $5.2 billion this year from $4.4 billion last year, but they
will still represent only about 2% of all clothing sales, according
to Forrester Research.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely complicated," said e-commerce consultant Lauren
Freedman, president of the E-tailing Group in Chicago. "It's highly
seasonal, very diverse and subject to trends. You can have a big hit
one year and the next you have a dog."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, offering a complete line of clothing is practically
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "In electronics, you can get together with Circuit City and that
covers 80% of the kind of items in demand," Freedman said. "No one
clothing chain covers nearly that much of the category."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than sell clothing itself, Amazon will partner with
existing online merchants such as Lands' End, which said Wednesday
that it has been involved in tests for the venture. Published reports
have named Gap Inc. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. as other partners. Both
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Amazon has little choice but to pursue increasingly
difficult categories. It often has stated it will grow by offering an
ever-increasing variety of items.</TE>
<TE>   That's important because as the number of online shoppers grows,
the average amount each of them spends declines. The number of
households shopping online during the all-important holiday season is
expected to reach 36.5 million, 4 million more than last year,
according to Forrester. But the average amount spent per person is
projected to fall by $30 to $433.</TE>
<TE>   Delhagen said the time for selling clothing online has come, due
mostly to increased sophistication of marketing and online tools.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early days, it was hard to see exactly what you were
getting when you looked at the sites," she said. As for fit,
customers could only guess. Through trial and error, Lands' End and
Eddie Bauer have learned how to successfully present clothing on the
Web.</TE>

<HD>EDS Earnings Dive; Firm to Cut 5,700 Jobs</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>PLANO, Texas</DL>
<LD>Electronic Data Systems Corp. on Wednesday said it will fire about
5,700 workers and sell business units to raise cash after
third-quarter profit fell 59%. Its shares rose as much as 15%.</LD>
<LD>   The company's net income dropped to $86 million, or 18 cents a
share, from $212 million, or 44 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell
2.8% to $5.41 billion from $5.56 billion.</LD>
<LD>   EDS signed about $3 billion in new contracts, less than it
expected and down from $6.8 billion a year earlier, Chief Executive
Richard Brown said on a conference call with analysts.</LD>
<TE>   Customers cut the size of contracts with EDS or didn't purchase
additional services, and some European contracts produced less
revenue than the company expected. Profit also was hurt by the
bankruptcies of US Airways Group Inc. and WorldCom Inc. and by a loss
on the sale of a unit that processes magazine orders.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares rose as high as $15.85 in extended trading
after the release. Earlier they fell 19 cents to $13.75 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.</TE>
<TE>   The world's second-largest seller of computer services said it
will cut as many as 5,680 jobs, starting with 800 to 1,000 jobs by
year-end. EDS employs about 142,000 people.</TE>

<HD>Federal Regulators to Hear El Paso Testimony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>El Paso Corp., the largest U.S. pipeline company, will get a chance
to argue before federal regulators that it didn't limit natural gas
supply to California during the state's energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold oral arguments
Dec. 2, Chairman Patrick H. Wood III said. The procedure has not been
used since 1997.</LD>
<LD>   The commission's chief administrative law judge ruled last month
that El Paso used "unlawful" market power from November 2000 to March
2001 to limit gas deliveries on a pipeline that supplies 40% of
California's gas.</LD>
<TE>   Judge Curtis L. Wagner said in his ruling that El Paso violated
federal regulations that required it to make its entire 3.3 billion
cubic feet of capacity on California pipelines available to shippers.
El Paso shut lines for unneeded repairs and failed to notify would-be
pipeline users of all available capacity at a time when California's
gas supplies were unusually tight, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The company has disputed the decision, saying it operated its
pipeline below the maximum capacity for safety reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The judge did not specify penalties. Wagner's ruling followed
months of hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fear is that what was a favorable ruling will be mitigated by
a FERC that has in the past been blindly pro- industry," said
Christian Schreiber, an investigator with a California state Senate
committee probing the state's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Houston-based El Paso rose 57 cents, or 7.8%, to $7.90
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Stock Funds on Pace for Another Net Outflow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market has rebounded in the last three weeks, but it's
unclear whether mutual fund investors are buying it.</LD>
<LD>   Stock funds had a $16.1-billion net cash outflow in September, the
fourth month in a row that redemptions outpaced new purchases,
according to data reported Wednesday by the Investment Company
Institute, the industry's main trade group. The outflow streak is the
longest since 1988.</LD>
<LD>   This month, stock funds are on pace for another net outflow,
according to unofficial estimates. Santa Rosa, Calif.-based
TrimTabs.com Investment Research expects a roughly $9.7-billion
outflow in October, based on its sampling of funds.</LD>
<TE>   But TrimTabs says stock fund cash flows have turned positive at
many fund firms in the last two weeks as share prices have revived.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard Group expects a net inflow of about $580 million this
month for its stock funds, while Fidelity Investments expects a
"fairly slight" outflow.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, investors continue to flock to bond funds, many of
which have risen in value this year as interest rates have fallen.
Bond funds took in a net $15.9 billion in September, the funds'
institute said.</TE>
<TE>   TrimTabs estimates a $12-billion inflow for bond funds this month.
But investors who bought bond funds in mid-October might have gotten
a nasty surprise as interest rates rebounded sharply before easing in
recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard is warning customers about potential interest rate risk
in the Treasury bond market. A bulletin on the firm's Web site warns
investors of "irrational exuberance" for higher-quality bonds. If
yields continue to rebound from their recent generational lows,
investors might get whipsawed as the value of older bonds declines.</TE>
<TE>   Through the first three quarters of this year, stock funds had a
net outflow of $18.7 billion, the institute said, while bond funds
had a net inflow of nearly $120 billion. "Hybrid" funds, which hold
stocks and bonds, had an inflow of $8.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Money market funds had an outflow of $157.6 billion through
September, the institute said -- including last month's record
outflow of $62.5 billion, which reduced total assets to $2.16
trillion. Most of those outflows have been by institutional investors
moving cash into other investments, with money funds yielding about
1.2% on average.</TE>

<HD>Intel Has 30 Days to Pay Intergraph</HD>
<DH>By making the $150-million payment, the chip maker can
continue to sell Itanium processors while appealing judge's ruling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MARSHALL, Texas</DL>
<LD>A U.S. District Court judge Wednesday ruled that Intel Corp. could
not manufacture and sell its most powerful microprocessor, but then
suspended his order immediately so the world's largest chip maker
could appeal the decision within 30 days.</LD>
<LD>   In his final judgment, Judge T. John Ward of the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas again found that two patents
held by computer services company Intergraph Corp., of Huntsville,
Ala., are valid. He cited nine cases of infringement by Intel's
Itanium chips.</LD>
<LD>   Ward in his order Wednesday suspended the injunction on making the
Itanium chips until Nov. 29. The judge had ruled Oct. 11 that the
chip maker was using Intergraph's patented technology without
permission in the Itanium-brand processors.</LD>
<TE>   Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said Wednesday that the Santa Clara,
Calif.-based firm will appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Under an earlier agreement, Intel said it would pay Intergraph
$150 million if it lost a motion for reconsideration on the Oct. 11
ruling. Intel on Wednesday confirmed it will make that payment.</TE>
<TE>   But if Intel prevails on appeal, it will pay nothing and receive a
license to the technology covered by the Intergraph patents. If it
loses, Intel must pay an additional $100 million to Intergraph to
license that technology.</TE>
<TE>   Itanium chips run server computers that manage Internet sites and
corporate networks. Analysts say Intel's server chips are 50% more
profitable than Pentium PC processors, and shipments may grow twice
as fast in coming years as PC demand levels off.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to avoid paying the $100 million without an appeal is
to redesign the Itanium chips and get the design approved by the
judge.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Intergraph rose 2 cents to $19.04 on Nasdaq. Intel
shares rose 59 cents to $16.99.</TE>

<HD>Levi's Signature Set for Wal-Mart Racks</HD>
<DH>It's the jeans maker's first foray into discount market,
where firm will offer the low-priced line.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Levi Strauss &amp; Co. wants to sell its blue jeans where America shops,
and increasingly that's at the major discount retail chains.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the San Francisco-based apparel maker said it struck
a deal with Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, to
sell a new line of lower-priced dungarees at its stores beginning in
July.</LD>
<LD>   Levi has struggled with declining sales since 1996 as jeans buyers
flocked to other brands and migrated from department stores to
discounters to buy their clothes, a trend that the introduction of
its new Signature brand intends to address, Chief Executive Philip
Marineau said.</LD>
<TE>   The point is to "sell where people shop," said Marineau, who has
been working to turn around the privately held company for the last
three years, in part by introducing new products and creating better
relationships with retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Levi's Signature brand is expected to generate "hundreds of
millions" in sales annually, Marineau said.</TE>
<TE>   The company, founded 149 years ago, also is talking with other
mass-merchandise chains about carrying the line, which will include
denim pants, shirts and jackets for men, women and children.</TE>
<TE>   More than 160 million people shop in stores such as Wal-Mart and
Target each week, Marineau said, and more than a third of all jeans
sold in the U.S. are bought in such stores.</TE>
<TE>   After six months of discussions, the deal with Wal-Mart was
completed last week, Marineau said. Levi will use no print or
television advertising to launch the new products, relying instead on
Wal-Mart to promote the line, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Retail experts say Levi's move makes sense. Apparel companies
increasingly are learning that they must tap into the lower-priced
retail market or be "left in the dust," said Rozilyn Bryant, an
analyst with Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Jones Apparel &amp; Co. and Liz Claiborne have launched or acquired
new brands to sell at lower-priced stores recently. These apparel
makers and others "recognize that's where a lot of consumer dollars
are going these days," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   Levi's portfolio now will include the Levi's, Dockers and
Signature brands. The Dockers line accounts for 20% to 25% of the
company's annual sales of $4.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Jeans in the new line will sell for less than $30, further
widening Levi's already unusually broad price range for its apparel.
The company sells jeans for as low as $30 to $35 in department stores
such as Mervyn's, Sears and JC Penney and as high as $220 at Barney's
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Lois Mikita, Wal-Mart's senior vice president of men's and boys'
apparel, described Levi Strauss Signature as "a great fit" with the
retailer. The chain also stocks Bugle Boy, Wrangler and Faded Glory
brands.</TE>
<TE>   Marineau said that Levi's sales should stabilize by the end of the
year and that the firm expects to see additional revenue growth in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter ended Aug. 25, Levi sales rose 3.5%, the
first quarterly sales gain since 1996. However, the firm's earnings
dropped 9% on higher costs.</TE>

<HD>Stock Market Keeps a Grip on Rally</HD>
<DH>Investors are buying as they wait for reports on economic
growth. Retailer shares are pushed lower on Wal-Mart downgrade.</DH>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market showed renewed resilience Wednesday, continuing the
rally that began late Tuesday, as investors awaited key economic
reports.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 58.47 points, or 0.7%, to
close at 8,427.41.</LD>
<LD>   The market's broader gauges also finished higher. The Nasdaq
composite climbed 26.19 points, or 2%, to 1,326.73. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 gained 8.56 points, or 1%, to 890.71.</LD>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 21 to 11 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 20 to 12 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market Treasury yields were little changed, after
diving Tuesday on a report showing consumer confidence at nine-year
lows.</TE>
<TE>   The confidence report initially hammered stocks Tuesday, but an
afternoon rally pared most of the losses. Buyers remained in control
of the market for most of Wednesday, despite more downbeat news from
the retail sector.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what investors are liking is the momentum the market had
the last 3 1/2 weeks," said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market
strategist at brokerage A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. "The market bent
[Tuesday], but it didn't break."</TE>
<TE>   IBM may have helped investor sentiment Wednesday: Chief Executive
Sam Palmisano, meeting with IBM customers, said he sees signs that
the global economy has "flattened out." IBM rose $1.93 to $78.67.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have rebounded from five-year lows reached in mid-October.
The Dow has gained 1,141 points, or 15.6%, since Oct. 9, though at
Wednesday's close it was below its recent peak of 8,538 reached Oct.
21.</TE>
<TE>   The government today is expected to give an estimate of economic
growth in the third quarter. On Friday the government will report on
October employment trends.</TE>
<TE>   Both reports will be closely watched by the Federal Reserve, which
meets Wednesday. Many analysts believe the Fed is poised to cut its
key short-term interest rate from the current 40-year low of 1.75%,
to help the economy.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment has driven Treasury bond yields lower in recent
days, after a sharp rebound in mid-October. On Wednesday yields were
relatively stable. The 10-year T-note edged up to 3.96% from 3.94% on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury said Wednesday it will sell a total of $40 billion in
five-year and 10-year notes next week to help cover the federal
budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Among Wednesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Tech stocks rebounded, pushing the Amex networking index up
11.8% and the SOX semiconductor index up 6.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Maxim Integrated Products climbed $3.29 to $32.72. The maker of
chips used in cars and MP3 music players said fiscal first-quarter
profit rose 19%.</TE>
<TE>   * The Dow got a boost from American Express, up $1.20 to $36.13;
and 3M, up $1.58 to $127.33.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug stocks lured buyers. Pharmacia rose $1.08 to $43.50 and
Merck added 79 cents to $54.24.</TE>
<TE>   * Wal-Mart led retailers lower after the stock was downgraded by
Goldman Sachs to "market performer" and removed from the brokerage's
recommended list. Goldman said the stock's price relative to earnings
leaves little room for additional gains in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart slid $2.67 to $53.80. Other retailers losing ground
included Target, down $1.33 to $30.20, and Kohl's, down $1.24 to
$57.01.</TE>
<TE>   * Darden Restaurants slid $2.91 to $20.01. The owner of chains
including Red Lobster said October sales were weak.</TE>

<HD>EU Fines Nintendo for Price Fixing</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Union on Wednesday levied a $146-million fine against
Nintendo Co. for allegedly fixing the prices of its video games and
consoles from 1991 to 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, the EU ruled that the Japanese game company impeded
free trade among European Union countries by instructing regional
distributors not to ship products outside their territories. The
result, according to the EU, was higher prices in some countries.</LD>
<LD>   Nintendo agreed to stop the practice in 1998 when it was notified
of an investigation, which concluded in 2000 with a ruling against
the company.</LD>
<TE>   The EU fine was larger than expected, said Edward Williams,
industry analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison, an investment banking
firm in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Nintendo plans to appeal the fine.</TE>
<TE>   Peter MacDougall, executive vice president of Nintendo, said the
fine, even if it stands, would not have a significant financial
impact on the company.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Nintendo released Internet adapters for its
GameCube console. The devices, priced at $34.95, let GameCube owners
play online. The gadget launched concurrently with "Phantasy Star
Online," a game developed by Sega Corp. for online play.</TE>

<HD>PacifiCare Reports Strong Earnings</HD>
<DH>Health insurer's stock soars as investors see progress on
company's promised turnaround.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., which just a year ago was in the hot
seat with investors and health providers, is beginning to make good
on its promised turnaround.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest supplier of Medicare health plans reported
Wednesday that its third-quarter profit more than doubled, to $43.8
million, as the Cypress-based company benefited from higher premiums
and jettisoning money-losing members.</LD>
<LD>   The unexpectedly strong results, announced after the close of
markets, sent PacifiCare's stock soaring to $28.76 in after-hours
trading. Shares were up $1.30 to $24.42 in regular Nasdaq trading.</LD>
<TE>   "This quarter shows that the company is making progress in the
short-term issues," said health-care analyst Greg Crawford, referring
to problems PacifiCare has had with pricing its premiums correctly
and its methods for paying hospitals and doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Like others in the managed-care industry, PacifiCare is generating
strong earnings because premium increases are outpacing costs for
medical care. But Crawford, who is with the brokerage Fox-Pitt,
Kelton, said PacifiCare's longer-term challenge is significant.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most other health plans, PacifiCare has unusually large
involvement in the Medicare market. As Medicare payments have failed
to keep up with medical cost inflation, PacifiCare has been getting
out of some geographic markets, reducing benefits and increasing
Medicare HMO premiums. At the end of the third quarter, the company's
senior membership was down 21% from a year ago, to 795,000.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Medicare accounted for almost 54% of PacifiCare's premium
revenue of $2.8 billion in the third quarter, Crawford said. "That
makes them very dependent on a government program that has an
uncertain future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare's management is trying to address this by building its
commercial HMO membership and specialty lines such as Medicare
supplemental coverage. The company also will continue to prune its
Medicare enrollment. Next year, it plans to pull out of more areas,
which will reduce membership by 37,000.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Phanstiel, PacifiCare's chief executive, said Wednesday
that he will not reduce Medicare HMO benefits as sharply next year,
noting that the company is prepared to make a smaller profit to
maintain as large a senior membership as possible.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with reporters, Phanstiel said he expected
commercial enrollment to grow next year, although it fell 8% over the
last year and will start next year lower because of the loss of the
California Public Employees' Retirement System account.</TE>
<TE>   Higher premiums still enabled the company to sharply cut its
medical-loss ratio, which measures the portion of revenue to pay for
medical services, to 85.8% from 89.2% a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The company's third-quarter earnings of $1.20 a share compared
with 93 cents a year earlier, after adjusting for a change in
accounting standards related to goodwill. Total revenue in the
quarter dropped 6% to $2.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Phanstiel said the third-quarter results "clearly surpassed even
our own expectations."</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare officials Wednesday boosted their full-year estimate,
to $3.90 a share, from $3.40 previously, but said they were not
prepared to give financial estimates for next year. The company said
its commercial customers would see premium increases averaging 15%,
about the same as this year.</TE>

<HD>Allegheny Troubles Could Help State</HD>
<DH>The power firm's woes could allow California to nullify an
undesirable contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A unit of Allegheny Energy Inc., short of cash and seeking to borrow
$2 billion, filed an emergency petition Tuesday with federal
regulators, asking them to uphold a long-term energy contract with
California.</LD>
<LD>   By removing uncertainty over the contract, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission will make it easier for Allegheny Energy Supply
Co. to sell or securitize the $4.4 billion, 11-year contract and
raise cash, company officials argue in the federal filing.</LD>
<LD>   Allegheny's desperate situation raises the possibility that the
state will get what it seeks -- an overturning of Allegheny's power
contract. Should the company file for bankruptcy protection, the
state could nullify the agreement, said Erik Saltmarsh, chief counsel
of California's Electricity Oversight Board.</LD>
<TE>   For that reason, Saltmarsh said, state officials are not alarmed
by Allegheny's desperate condition. "We'd rather have an unreasonable
contract go away than keep an unreasonable contract," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the nation's energy companies have plummeted in value,
troubled by scandal, collapsed prices and reluctant lenders. But
among the 29 companies with which California signed long-term power
accords last year, Hagerstown, Md.-based Allegheny is the first to
experience such serious financial trouble that the state has demanded
assurances it can fulfill its contract.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the company asked for an extension on providing such
assurances. And Tuesday it filed the emergency motion with FERC.</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago state regulators asked FERC to overturn dozens of
long-term power contracts, including one with Allegheny. The state
said the contracts should be nullified because they were signed when
energy companies were illegally manipulating the state's energy
market in the spring of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   FERC has set a hearing on the issue for Dec. 2, with a decision
expected in February 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Allegheny's motion asks FERC to quickly dismiss California's
challenge to its contract because it is "inflicting significant
financial harm" on the company and its parent.</TE>
<TE>   Allegheny's stock has fallen nearly 57% in the last month, losing
10 cents on Wednesday to close at $5.70 on the New York Stock
Exchange. That's down from its 12-month high of $43.86.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Allegheny Energy disclosed that it is in
technical default under its principal credit agreements and those of
its subsidiaries. According to Standard &amp; Poor's credit-rating
service, the company has $5 billion in outstanding debt, with $230
million in cash and available credit lines on Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street credit-rating agencies downgraded Allegheny because of
the uncertainty over the contracts, which in turn has scared away
potential lenders, wrote Allegheny President Michael P. Morrell, in a
signed statement to FERC.</TE>

<HD>Pumpkin Kit Seller Seeks to Squash Infringement</HD>
<DH>Maker of carving tools has sued Restoration Hardware and
others it says violate its patents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the time of year for witches, goblins and ghosts. But to one
Denver company, nothing is more evil than patent infringement.</LD>
<LD>   Pumpkin Ltd., the maker of kits that have elevated the crude
process of carving a pumpkin to an art form, has been busy trying to
protect its chief product from what company executives say are
illegal copycats. Its latest target: Corte Madera, Calif.-based
Restoration Hardware Inc., which sells a $39 pumpkin carving kit
complete with 15 tools and a canvas tool belt.</LD>
<LD>   The suit is one of at least 50 that the maker of the Pumpkin
Masters kits has filed in the last 10 years against retailers and
manufacturers. Other big- name defendants have included
Williams-Sonoma Inc. and Walt Disney Co., which reached undisclosed
settlements with Pumpkin Ltd. A suit lodged against Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia Inc. was dropped.</LD>
<TE>   Noting the large number of defendants that have come before it,
Restoration Hardware downplayed the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like they're just trying to throw butter on the wall
and see what sticks," spokesman Dave Glassman said.</TE>
<TE>   For privately held Pumpkin Ltd., the suit is in fact all about its
bread and butter.</TE>
<TE>   "We do fiercely protect our intellectual property rights, and we
will litigate if we have to," company President Gay Burke said. Burke
added that Pumpkin Masters has changed the way America carves its
gourds with unique scooping and cutting tools that allow for
elaborate design.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, Halloween has shifted from a minor dress-up
day for children to a full-fledged cultural tradition, with adults
joining in the scary fun.</TE>
<TE>   American consumers this year are expected to spend $6.9 billion on
Halloween costumes, candy and decorations, according to the National
Retail Federation. Pumpkins, greet- ing cards and party supplies
account for $2.7 billion of the total.</TE>
<TE>   Pumpkin Masters employees have appeared on morning talk shows to
promote their kits, and the company holds an annual carving contest,
according to its Web site. In the off-season, the company sells
watermelon-carving kits.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corning Inc., the world's biggest maker of optical fiber for carrying
telephone calls and data, reported a sixth straight quarterly loss
and plans to cut 2,200 more jobs after sales tumbled 45%.</LD>
<LD>   The third-quarter net loss narrowed to $133 million, or 25 cents a
share, from $220 million, or 24 cents, in the year-earlier period,
Corning said. Sales slid to $837 million from $1.51 billion.
Per-share results reflect payment of preferred stock dividends.</LD>
<LD>   Corning forecast a fourth-quarter loss, excluding job-cut costs
and some other expenses, of 8 cents to 12 cents a share on sales of
$775 million to $825 million. The average estimate of analysts polled
by Thomson First Call is for a loss of 6 cents on sales of $845.9
million.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of the Corning, N.Y.-based company rose 14 cents to $2.02

<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS has canceled "Bram and Alice," a new sitcom starring Alfred
Molina that had been airing Sunday nights. The program is produced by
Paramount Television, which like CBS is a unit of Viacom Inc.
Paramount had attempted to shop the series -- which comes from former
producers of the studio's long-running hit "Frasier" -- to other
networks, without success, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   CBS has not announced a replacement for the time period
and probably will air reruns of its comedies to fill the void. The
network is working on a series adaptation of the hit movie "My Big
Fat Greek Wedding" that could occupy that half-hour beginning next
year. "Bram and Alice" represents CBS' first cancellation of the new
TV season.</LD>

<LD>Federal prosecutors are expected to announce today that a federal
grand jury in Houston has indicted former Enron Corp. Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow for his role in the energy firm's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Allegations in the indictment reportedly will mirror a criminal
complaint filed this month by the Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   That suggests that Fastow, who had been refusing to cooperate with
government investigators, has been unable or unwilling to bargain
away some of the charges against him by turning on his former Enron
bosses, legal experts said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A former vice president of sales at San Francisco-based Critical Path
Inc. has pleaded guilty to one count of insider trading, becoming the
fourth former executive of the company to plead guilty to stock
fraud, U.S. prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   In January 2001, Jonathan Beck sold 27,343 shares of Critical Path
stock for an average price of $24.54 and reaped proceeds of $671,213,
said the U.S. attorney's office for the northern district of
California.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutors said Beck entered his plea Tuesday. He admitted
selling the shares while he was aware that company executives were
involved in a scheme to inflate revenue at the e-mail software and
services provider.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Expanding its ability to create virtual movie sets, visual effects
giant Industrial Light &amp; Magic signed a three-year licensing
agreement with Mental Images, a German rendering software company.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies, which are privately held, declined to discuss
financial details of the deal. ILM, a San Rafael, Calif.-based
division of Lucas Digital Ltd., has used Mental Images' tools to
create photo-realistic light effects since 1995, particularly in
films such as "Pearl Harbor" and "Minority Report," said Cliff
Plumer, ILM's chief technology officer.</LD>
<LD>   Although ILM is known for developing special-effects software,
Plumer said, "In this case, it made more financial sense for us to
have an outside company provide the software tools we need."</LD>

<HD>Tommy Hilfiger to Shut Most U.S. Stores</HD>
<DH>Apparel maker will sell 37 outlets after the holiday
season, blaming weak performance in the retail industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clothing maker Tommy Hilfiger Corp. said Wednesday that it plans to
close most of its U.S. stores and expects earnings for the rest of
the year to lag, citing a bleak retail environment.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Tommy Hilfiger -- which reported a 27% rise in quarterly
earnings, helped by strength in Europe -- fell $1.85, or nearly 20%,
to $7.50, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York
Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Shaky consumer confidence "has negative potential implications for
holiday apparel spending," the company said.</LD>
<TE>   "Our previous plans had anticipated some improvement in holiday
and spring," Chief Executive Joel Horowitz said. "Although it is too
early to gauge retail performance for those seasons, we now believe
that promotional pressures will be greater than previously expected."</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Hilfiger said it plans to sell 37 of its 44 U.S. specialty
stores after the holiday selling season, citing weak performance.</TE>
<TE>   The Hong Kong-based apparel designer and retailer reported net
income of $61 million, or 67 cents a share, in the fiscal second
quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $47.9 million, or 53 cents, a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Net revenue in the quarter was roughly flat at $546.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which recently named Tommy Hilfiger chairman, was
expected to earn 59 cents a share, according to earnings tracking
firm Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of weakness in the retail industry and increased
promotional activity, Tommy Hilfiger said it expects earnings in the
second half, before charges, of 45 cents to 65 cents a share.</TE>

<LD>In a highly unusual travel warning, Canada is urging its citizens
born in countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia to think carefully
before entering the United States, saying they could run afoul of
tough new U.S. anti-terrorism laws.</LD>
<LD>   The Foreign Ministry said it issued the advisory after Washington
stipulated that anyone born in Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan or Syria
needed to be photographed and fingerprinted upon arrival in the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not something we approve of, and we've registered our
strongest disapproval with the United States authorities," Foreign
Minister Bill Graham said.</LD>

<LD>Indonesian police released sketches of three men suspected of bombing
two Bali nightclubs this month. Officials said the trio could be part
of a group of as many as 10 involved in the blast that killed more
than 180 people.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Prasetyo, a police spokesman, said the men are Indonesians,
ages 20, 27 and 30. He said detectives have identified one man but
refused to release his name.</LD>
<LD>   Maj. Gen. Made Mangku Pastika, who heads the investigation,
described the three as "field operators" who may have died in the

<LD>A Swedish prosecutor dropped a hijacking probe of a man who boarded a
plane with a loaded gun in his luggage.</LD>
<LD>   Kerim Chatty, 29, was freed last month after spending four weeks
in jail on suspicion of planning to hijack a London-bound airliner.
At that time, chief prosecutor Thomas Haeggstroem said suspicion had
waned.</LD>
<LD>   Though Haeggstroem dropped the probe, he said Chatty could still
face a weapons charge in the Aug. 29 incident.</LD>

<HD>Chechen Rebel Envoy Arrested in Denmark</HD>
<DH>Russia suspects that Ahmed Zakayev, once a key peace
negotiator, helped plan the Moscow theater siege. He may face
terrorism charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Responding to a Russian request, Danish authorities Wednesday
arrested Chechen rebel envoy Ahmed Zakayev and said he may be
extradited to face terrorism charges.</LD>
<LD>   Zakayev -- a top aide to Aslan Maskhadov, the former Chechen
president -- was once a key peace negotiator. His arrest, after last
week's deadly seizure of a Moscow theater by armed Chechens, further
reduces prospects for ending the war in Chechnya.</LD>
<LD>   Danish police said Russian authorities suspect that Zakayev, 43,
helped prepare the siege in which at least 119 hostages died, nearly
all from a gas used by Russian police forces who stormed the theater.
Moscow also accuses him of terrorist acts from 1996 to 1999.</LD>
<TE>   After days of an internationally criticized refusal by Russian
authorities to identify the gas, Health Minister Yuri L. Shevchenko
said Wednesday that it was based on fentanyl. That drug, a powerful
synthetic version of morphine, normally is not used as an inhaled
anesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   Shevchenko said the gas would not cause death unless those exposed
to it were weakened. He said he could "officially declare" that no
internationally banned chemical weapons were used in the rescue
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Zakayev's arrest came amid signs of a growing anti-Islamic
hysteria in the Russian media and widespread advocacy of tough
national security measures, which some observers see as threatening
an even bloodier conflict in Chechnya and an erosion of Russia's
still-shaky democratic freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   Izvestia, one of Russia's most liberal and influential daily
newspapers, carried an exceptionally harsh front-page commentary
Wednesday charging that "there is no freedom-fighting" in Chechnya
but only "a struggle for the right to steal oil" and "a monstrous
plan of Islamic extremists, a plan to annihilate the entire Christian
civilization."</TE>
<TE>   The attack on the theater was "part of this worldwide plan," the
commentary said. "We must understand as soon as possible that to save
civilization and save Russia means to make sacrifices." The article
also praised Yuri V. Andropov, a onetime KGB chief and one of the
last hard-line Communist leaders of the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   The article is a "landmark which signifies growing popularity of
tougher domestic policy measures among the Russian political and
intellectual elite," said Liliya F. Shevtsova, an analyst at the
Moscow Carnegie Center. "The police regime in Russia is bound to
become stronger and tougher."</TE>
<TE>   A popular Russian tabloid, Moskovsky Komsomolets, ran an article
Wednesday saying that rather than being given to relatives, the
bodies of about 50 Chechen rebels killed at the theater would be
wrapped in pigskins and buried by state security services.</TE>
<TE>   "Writing about burying Muslims in pigskins is nothing but a call
for blood feud on a nationwide scale," Shevtsova said. "What we can
see today is that former Russian liberals and democrats are marching
in the vanguard rows under the banner of the Black Hundred," a
reference to extremists who carried out pogroms in czarist times.
"This is what is scary."</TE>
<TE>   More funerals were held for dead hostages, including a joint
ceremony for two teenage friends, Arseny Kurilenko and Kristina
Kurbatova, who were in the cast of "Nord-Ost," the play being
performed when the theater was seized. They had been nicknamed "Romeo
and Juliet" by their friends, and they were buried side by side.</TE>
<TE>   "They loved each other in their own way, the way kids do," said
Artur Kurilenko, Arseny's father. He too warned against a turn to
vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is to avoid all attempts to take
revenge, especially on the basis of one's ethnic identity, because
people will die," Kurilenko told TVS television. "The most horrible
thing is that children will die. We would very much like our
children's grave to become a symbol of youth, love and peace."</TE>
<TE>   Zakayev, a onetime actor, took part in the 1996 talks that ended
the first, two-year Chechnya war with an uneasy truce and an
agreement to discuss Chechen independence in 2001. Russian forces
reentered the republic in 1999 after a series of bloody incidents
blamed on Chechen separatists, and they have battled guerrillas there
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The only direct negotiations since the war resumed came in
November 2001, when Zakayev met a representative of Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin for two hours at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport.
Russian authorities guaranteed his safety for that trip.</TE>
<TE>   While in Copenhagen for a meeting of the World Chechen Congress,
Zakayev condemned the theater raid, in which Chechen fighters took
more than 750 hostages. At the same time, he warned that if Moscow
did not agree to peace talks, radical factions outside the control of
the main rebel authorities might attack targets such as nuclear power
plants.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no military solution to the conflict, only a political
solution," Zakayev said Monday, a day of national mourning in Russia
for the dead hostages. "President Maskhadov is ready to negotiate
without preconditions, as he said before. Now it is up to the Russian
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   The Kremlin has accused Denmark of showing "solidarity with
terrorists," and in protest of Copenhagen's refusal to ban the
Chechen congress, Putin canceled a visit there for a European
Union-Russia summit scheduled for November. In an effort to placate
Moscow, Denmark agreed to move the summit to Brussels.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Wednesday
that the arrest of Zakayev did not reflect Russian pressure but was
decided "according to normal police procedures."</TE>
<TE>   To win Zakayev's extradition, Russia will need to provide more
evidence and guarantee that he will not face the death penalty,
Danish authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Germans May Call FBI Chief to Testify</HD>
<DH>Attorney says Mueller comments could help client accused of
aiding the Sept. 11 hijackers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dirk Laabs</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>HAMBURG, Germany</DL>
<LD>Defense attorneys for a Moroccan accused of providing logistical
support to the Sept. 11 suicide pilots said Wednesday that they would
seek to call FBI Director Robert Mueller and two suspected Al Qaeda
members as witnesses in the man's trial.</LD>
<LD>   Mounir Motassadeq is the first person charged with direct
involvement in the Sept. 11 plot to go on trial. Motassadeq
acknowledges that he knew the men in the Hamburg cell from which some
of the pilots came and helped transfer money to some of them. He has
said that he and the other men traveled to Al Qaeda camps in
Afghanistan. However, he says he knew nothing of the plot to attack
the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Hans Leistritz, one of Motassadeq's lawyers, said Wednesday that
he would seek to call Mueller to bolster that claim. He cited an
interview with Mueller published in the Washington Post in June in
which the FBI chief said that the planning for the attacks occurred
in Afghanistan, not Hamburg. Motassadeq could not have known about
the plan if it was conceived outside Hamburg, Leistritz asserted.</LD>
<TE>   Motassadeq's defense has also asked that Ramzi Binalshibh,
suspected of helping coordinate the attacks, and Mohambedou Ould
Slahi, suspected of helping plan a foiled millennium bombing of LAX,
be brought to testify. Both men have been captured; Binalshibh is in
U.S. custody and Slahi is believed to be.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Maklat, a 28-year-old Sudanese man who is studying in
Berlin, testified Wednesday that he knew many of the members of the
Hamburg cell and prayed frequently with Motassadeq and hijacker
Mohamed Atta. He said that he met Atta at a mosque in 1996 and that
the 33-year-old Egyptian had a particularly stern interpretation of
Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a guy who wanted always to be right. He felt he was a
leader," Maklat said. He quoted Atta as saying: "You have to show the
outside world when you are abroad that you are a Muslim, through your
behavior, your clothes; you have to be a role model."</TE>
<TE>   One day in a grocery store, Maklat said, "Atta asked me if I am
ready to fight for my faith. 'Not yet,' I answered. Atta answered,
'The brothers die in Bosnia-Herzegovina and you say no.' It was a
test for me."</TE>
<TE>   Another time, he said, Atta told him, "Joy kills the heart."</TE>
<TE>   Maklat said Atta believed that the Western world was united in
fighting against Muslims everywhere. But neither Atta nor others in
their group of friends ever talked about committing violence, Maklat
said. "I was shivering all over when I saw the pictures of [hijacker
Ziad Samir] Jarrah and the others on TV. There was no hint ever they
would do something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq has said he was unaware that any of his friends had
moved to the United States to take flying lessons. He has said he
thought Atta was in Malaysia. But Maklat said either Motassadeq or
another friend told him in 2000 that Atta was in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokesman John Iannarelli said Wednesday that the bureau had
yet to receive a summons for Mueller to testify. Lacking that,
Iannarelli said, the agency does not have enough information to know
if Mueller would agree.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and Germany have been feuding over Berlin's refusal to
share information on Zacarias Moussaoui, the man charged by the U.S.
with trying to join the Sept. 11 conspiracy as a pilot.</TE>
<TE>   America has said it will seek the death penalty against Moussaoui;
the German Constitution forbids cooperating with other governments in
capital cases.</TE>

<HD>Tipping the Scales in a War</HD>
<DH>Colombia is forming an army of citizen informers to help
stem bloodshed. Peace and cash are the lures in the controversial
program.</DH>

<DL>MARIANGOLA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>As in the past, the guerrillas blocked the road just after dawn
outside this tiny way station at the foot of snowcapped peaks in
northeastern Colombia.</LD>
<LD>   They stopped all traffic, seized five commercial trucks carrying
food and supplies and forced the drivers and passengers to head
toward the rebels' redoubt in the mountains.</LD>
<LD>   But this time, a livestock dealer saw the caravan pass by. He
stopped, placed a call on a pay phone, and within 30 minutes, the
Colombian military was on the scene. There was a brief gun battle,
and the guerrillas fled, leaving behind the trucks, the supplies and
the captives.</LD>
<TE>   "I just want the violence put behind us," said the tipster, a
52-year-old man who travels the dusty back roads of this province to
buy and sell goats, sheep and cattle. "I am tired of it."</TE>
<TE>   Ordinary as the tip may sound, it represents a revolution here in
Colombia, where the government and citizenry have long been
indifferent to each other.</TE>
<TE>   The bust was the latest success in Colombia's new and
controversial program to encourage ordinary citizens to play a bigger
role in ending this country's four-decade-long civil war. President
Alvaro Uribe is trying to create a nationwide, million-member network
of citizen informers as the centerpiece of his new plan to crack down
on the leftist rebels fighting for control of the country and the
outlawed, right-wing paramilitaries who are their sworn enemies.</TE>
<TE>   But the network is not only an effort to quell the bloodshed that
leaves nearly 4,000 dead each year, the majority of them civilians.
It's also an experiment in governance, a countrywide Civics 101
lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Colombia's most fundamental problem is that there is no
government in many parts of the country. About 10% of counties have
no police force. Mayors and city council members have fled scores of
communities under threat of death. The only law in huge chunks of
rural Colombia is either the guerrillas or the paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   The network, then, is an attempt to convince Colombians who have
become apathetic in the face of government neglect to get involved in
their country's future: You trust us and we'll respond.</TE>
<TE>   "People have learned to live with pressure from the armed groups,
to get along with them," said Army Lt. Martin Martinez, who
participated in the operation this month against the guerrillas a few
miles down the road from this tumbledown town of tin-roofed shacks
and roadside snack stands. "If we manage to get rid of them, the
people's trust will return."</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups and others, however, have denounced the
program, saying it risks turning civilians into military targets and
opens the door to anonymous accusations by neighbors who want merely
to settle scores.</TE>
<TE>   Several groups were horrified this summer when the government
began distributing reward money on live television to hooded
participants in the program. To many, it raised the specter of a
Stalinist state. The practice has since been suspended.</TE>
<TE>   "The army and police have their own intelligence networks. They
need to strengthen those structures, rather than rely on ordinary
people," said Mireya Mejia, the peace and conflict resolution advisor
to the provincial government. "This network of [civilian] informants
inserts the population into the conflict."</TE>
<TE>   'Adding Fuel to Fire'</TE>
<TE>   No one has been hurt so far, but such fears may not be unfounded.
A local rebel commander claimed that the guerrillas had already
infiltrated police ranks and were developing a list of those
participating to be targeted for assassination.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas, he said, had formed their own "network of
informants in the network of informants."</TE>
<TE>   "The moment that a citizen turns into an informant, they have
stopped being a civilian," said Comandante Domingo, a leader in the
National Liberation Army, or ELN, the second-largest Colombian
guerrilla group. "They have become helpers of the army.</TE>
<TE>   "Uribe's plan is only adding fuel to the fire," he said in a
telephone interview arranged through an intermediary.</TE>
<TE>   In concept, Uribe's plan is no more threatening than a Crime-
stopper program in the United States. Citizens call in with a tip and
are given rewards of up to $4,000, depending on the value of the
information.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a Colombian twist: Citizens who want to participate
must first pass a background check, to make sure they have no
guerrilla or criminal history. After passing, each gets a code to use
during calls. Each province has a tip line. Callers can dial in and
speak with a 911-type operator; the master list of codes and
participants' names is closely guarded.</TE>
<TE>   The day after he took office Aug. 7, Uribe inaugurated the network
here in the province of Cesar, where two soaring mountain ranges
hover over vast plains filled with cattle. Haunting plantations of
African oil palms stretch for miles, the long, regular rows of
towering trees creating forests of dark shadows and hidden places.</TE>
<TE>   The province is strategic for two reasons. First, the poorly paved
two-lane blacktop running through its middle connects Bogota,
Colombia's capital, to important ports on the Caribbean coast such as
Barranquilla.</TE>
<TE>   Second, it's rich in coal. Alabama-based Drummond Co. -- owners of
the Rancho La Quinta planned community near Palm Springs -- has a
huge open pit mine in the middle of the province that produces 40% of
the country's annual 55 million tons of exported coal. Colombia is
the largest exporter of coal to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Haven for Rebels</TE>
<TE>   The mountains that surround the province to the north and east
have long provided refuge to all the players in the nation's
conflict, making the province one of the more violent in Colombia. In
2001, it ranked second in kidnappings per capita and 13th of 32
provinces in homicides per capita, according to police figures.</TE>
<TE>   The province's high crime rate and economic importance have
brought Uribe back four times in the nearly three months he's been in
office. He has sent 400 more soldiers and police to the area,
provided new equipment and pushed for the development of the citizen
informer network.</TE>
<TE>   In short, he has demanded results -- and he has gotten them.</TE>
<TE>   A two-day tour through what had been some of the most dangerous
roads in the country revealed no guerrilla or paramilitary roadblocks
-- common features in Colombia's countryside.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic along the province's major roads soared 43% the first
month after the informant program began and increased an additional
16% last month, government statistics show. Mass kidnappings have all
but ceased. Merchant reports of shakedowns have declined.</TE>
<TE>   Community leaders, local businessmen and ordinary folks in towns
along the roads consistently praised the program, saying it had
brought a measure of security to once-forgotten byways. People who
had feared leaving their small villages said they have begun to
travel again.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that traveling along our roads was like playing the
lottery," said Genevieve Moreno, a town official in Becerril, which
lies along the road that hugs the Perija mountains bordering
Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   "If you left town, you might hit a guerrilla roadblock. Now
there's more security and more vigilance."</TE>
<TE>   Citizen informers have called in to report a variety of incidents,
both common crimes and guerrilla activity. One caller reported four
trucks filled with stolen cattle. Police captured 37 cows.</TE>
<TE>   Another caller, who had not even joined the network, phoned when
he saw a truck filled with gas cylinders parked along the road.
Rebels often use cylinders to make devastating homemade mortars.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrived, seized the truck and found a map inside of a town,
with an arrow pointing to the local military base.</TE>
<TE>   Such successes have restored many locals' confidence in
government. Participation in the province's informer network zoomed
from about 90 people to more than 850 in little more than two months.</TE>
<TE>   "If the subversives want to stop this, they're going to have to
kill everyone. People are very much behind this program," said Col.
Orlando Paez, police commander for the province.</TE>
<TE>   Police estimate that most calls come from people seeking reward
money. But 10% to 15% are from Colombians just interested in helping
out the government.</TE>
<TE>   The livestock dealer, for example, has yet to be paid, but he said
he wasn't worried. He was chased from his ranch by guerrillas years
ago and is happy to be striking a blow against them.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, people thought this was the government's problem," the
man said in an interview arranged by local police. "Now, we
understand that the guerrillas are a problem for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   The two-day tour also revealed that the military's heightened
presence along the province's highways has played a major role in
restoring law and order.</TE>
<TE>   The police and soldiers have been provided better equipment. Shiny
high-powered motorcycles patrol constantly. U.S.-built Black Hawk
helicopters with high-caliber machine guns fly overhead.</TE>
<TE>   President Criticized</TE>
<TE>   Such militarization has prompted criticism that Uribe is spending
too much on the army and not enough on social services for the
impoverished province's 1 million inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   "Uribe is turning this province into a laboratory for war," said a
human rights worker. "He doesn't care about health, education or
social welfare."</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups have also complained that the army has focused
more on attacking guerrilla groups than on targeting the
paramilitaries, who dominate the northern and central sections of the
province and are accused of working with the military to wipe out the
guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Those worries, however, seemed a distant concern to many of the
province's residents. They were simply happy enough to be traveling
the roads again.</TE>
<TE>   A trucker who slowed to stop for a police roadblock greeted the
officers with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have something to report, where do I call?" he asked.</TE>

<HD>IRA Pulls Out of Talks on Disarmament</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>The Irish Republican Army broke off contact Wednesday with the
international body overseeing disarmament in Northern Ireland, in the
latest blow to peace efforts in the British province.</LD>
<LD>   The IRA's decision to stop its slow-moving talks on scrapping
weapons -- a key goal of Northern Ireland's 4-year-old peace accord
-- followed widespread calls for the outlawed group to disband.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement to the weekly Sinn Fein-IRA newspaper Republican
News, IRA commanders said they were suspending negotiations because
of what they called "an effort to impose unacceptable and untenable
ultimatums on the IRA."</LD>
<TE>   Britain and police chiefs called the move regrettable but
predictable, while Protestant leaders said the IRA's determination to
cling to its weaponry demonstrated why Protestants should not be
expected to cooperate with the IRA-linked Sinn Fein political party.</TE>
<TE>   The IRA blamed both Britain and Protestant leaders for fueling the
crisis besetting the peace agreement, which proposed a joint
Catholic-Protestant administration for Northern Ireland and the
gradual disarmament of outlawed groups.</TE>
<TE>   But the IRA, which has largely observed a cease-fire since 1997,
said it "remains committed to the search for a just and lasting
peace."</TE>

<HD>Sharon's Coalition Falls Apart</HD>
<DH>Israel's Labor ministers resign amid a battle over funding
of settlements. Analysts say the party's leader is moving to shore up
his support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel's center-left Labor Party ended an uneasy 20-month alliance
with conservative Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on Wednesday, leaving
Israeli politics in a state of disarray at a time of intense conflict
with the Palestinians and looming regional confrontation between the
United States and Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The Labor ministers submitted their resignations from the
coalition government, which take 48 hours to go into effect, in the
midst of a showdown with Sharon over how large a share of the budget
should go to Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   The move, however, was widely read by political analysts as an
effort by Labor's leader, Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, to
strengthen his hand against rivals for the party leadership next
month by making a decisive break now with Sharon and his conservative
Likud Party.</LD>
<TE>   The Labor Party was Sharon's largest coalition partner, and its
defection forces him to either seek new parliamentary alliances with
smaller right-wing and religious parties, or chart a course for early
elections. If he opts for the latter, a vote could be scheduled as
soon as the end of January, which would be nearly 10 months ahead of
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   After a day of stormy negotiations failed to stave off the Labor
pullout, Sharon indicated that he would seek to stay in power -- for
the time being, at least -- with a narrower coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to lead the country with responsibility and
discretion," he said in a brief address to the Knesset, or
parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Labor and Likud were always strange bedfellows. As the principal
partners in a coalition steering Israel through one of its most
violent periods in decades, the two differed sharply on bedrock
issues of war and peace. Shimon Peres, the Labor foreign minister and
Nobel Peace Prize winner, had helped craft the landmark Oslo accords;
Sharon made it his mission to dismantle them.</TE>
<TE>   Although Peres resigned along with Ben-Eliezer and four other
Labor ministers, it wasn't without trying desperately to prevent the
breakup. Peres has been one of the most ardent advocates of working
from within to nudge the Sharon government in the direction of peace
overtures to the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Without Labor in the government, reviving peace efforts could be
doubly difficult, because Sharon would have to hew to a hard line to
keep his right-wing coalition partners on board. They would probably
object strongly to key provisions of a U.S. peace plan presented to
Israel and the Palestinians last week, which envisions a freeze on
Jewish settlements and an easing of Israel's military grip on the
West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government shakeup also coincides with concerted
efforts by the Bush administration to ensure that Israel will not be
drawn into any conflict involving Iraq. During the 1991 Persian Gulf
War, Israel held off on any retaliation, at U.S. behest, when Saddam
Hussein's forces launched 39 Scud missiles at the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   Although Labor is more open to rapprochement with the Palestinians
than is Sharon, Israeli political factions are more united on the
subject of Iraq. There is broad general agreement with Sharon's view
that if Israel is attacked with any weapon of mass destruction, there
would be no choice but to retaliate.</TE>
<TE>   What had kept the two factions together was a widely held notion
that maintaining a united front was paramount in a time of war.
Sharon skillfully cobbled together the largest coalition government
in Israeli political history, thus marginalizing any genuine
opposition and bolstering his every stand against the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   And Labor leaders -- coming off a devastating loss to Sharon and
Likud in February 2001 elections -- were painfully aware that their
following had dwindled; any hopes of power lay in sharing it with the
right. So they papered over their differences, and as an entire,
fearful nation moved to the right, so did the Labor Party, as part of
Sharon's government.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it was raw politics that severed the alliance.
Ben-Eliezer faces a tough internal struggle to hold on to leadership
of his party ahead of its Nov. 19 primaries. A former army general
who is almost as hawkish as Sharon, the Iraqi-born Ben-Eliezer is
most vulnerable on his left flank and must distance himself from
Sharon if he is to rebuild his power base.</TE>
<TE>   Labor's collaboration with rightist Likud diluted much of the
center-left party's political identity and erased an agenda that once
reflected a growing national consensus that Palestinian statehood was
inevitable and Israel should get on with the pragmatic task of
negotiating terms with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   To regain any standing, the influential daily Haaretz said in an
editorial, the Labor Party "must now awake from its political coma
and sharpen its dulled positions on the major issues."</TE>
<TE>   The loss of Labor support leaves Sharon with control of 55 seats
in the 120-member Knesset, in which he needs 61 votes for a majority.
His aides were said to be putting out feelers already to several
smaller parties that could provide more than enough seats to make up
that shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Such a coalition, however, would be much more unstable than the
broad-based "national unity" government with Labor. Sharon's
predecessor, Labor's Ehud Barak, learned that the hard way, presiding
over a precarious government that was constantly held hostage to the
demands of small but pivotal parties he needed to hold his majority
together.</TE>
<TE>   Early elections would pose little threat to Sharon's Likud, which
would almost certainly stand to pick up parliamentary seats. Through
more than two years of the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, polls
have consistently given Likud a substantial edge over Labor.</TE>
<TE>   But a national election could put Sharon on the defensive against
an old rival -- former Prime Minister and fellow Likud member
Benjamin Netanyahu, who remains a formidable figure in Israeli
politics, and like Sharon has made a hard line toward the
Palestinians his political trademark.</TE>
<TE>   The national budget for the coming year -- the ostensible cause of
the split -- handily won preliminary parliamentary approval after the
Labor defection, by a 67-45 vote. But the bill faces two more
parliamentary readings, and next time it comes up for a vote, Sharon
may face a plethora of fresh budget demands from his new coalition
partners.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor ministers had sought to shift $145 million from the
settlements to social spending, mainly on programs aimed at helping
Israel's poor. Although the money represents only a tiny fraction of
Israel's overall $57-billion budget, Ben-Eliezer told lawmakers that
in the end, a compromise could simply not be found.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt it impossible that in the Israel of 2002, there would be
tens of thousands of hungry children," he said. "We felt it
impossible that in today's Israel, senior citizens would be deprived
of stipends."</TE>
<TE>   By the standards of Israeli politics, the coalition over which
Sharon had presided since his election was a remarkably stable and
long-lived one. Plagued by chaotic infighting, Israeli governing
coalitions crumble with almost clockwork regularity. Sharon is the
fifth prime minister in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the national tradition -- it drives everybody crazy,
but it goes on like this," said Hanoch Smith, a pollster and
political analyst. "This may be an artificial crisis, but it's one
that had to come sooner or later."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian reaction to the Israeli political turmoil was muted.
Senior negotiator Saeb Erekat called the coalition's collapse an
internal Israeli affair but expressed concern that a move to the
right by the government would be "at the expense of the Palestinian
people and against the peace process."</TE>

<DL>AMMAN, Jordan</DL>
<LD>The body of slain U.S. diplomat Laurence Foley was flown to the
United States on Wednesday after a grim airport ceremony, but
Jordanian investigators reported no progress in tracking down his
killer.</LD>
<LD>   Diplomats fought back tears as mournful bagpipe music filled the
air and Marines and U.S. Embassy colleagues carried Foley's
flag-draped coffin from a hearse onto a slate-gray Air Force C-141
military transport at the airport in Amman, the Jordanian capital.</LD>
<LD>   Foley, 60, was shot by a lone gunman Monday in front of his home
in Amman. Police have rounded up dozens of Islamic militants for
questioning in the shooting.</LD>
<TE>   Minister of Planning and Development Bassam Awadallah praised
Foley, who worked with the U.S. Agency for International Development
in Amman, for his devotion to improving the lives of poor Jordanians.</TE>
<TE>   Jordanian officials have said the slaying was aimed at
destabilizing Jordan and harming its close relations with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "We must see to it that the intended consequences of this
despicable act are never materialized," Awadallah said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm Jr. also reaffirmed the "abiding
bonds" between Jordan and the United States. "Together we will
confront those who would seek to damage those ties," he said.</TE>

<HD>Japan and North Korea End Talks With No Real Progress</HD>
<DH>Communist state won't agree to end its nuclear program, and
Tokyo refuses to step up aid discussions. Abduction issue continues
to fester.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>North Korea defiantly refused to abandon its nuclear weapons program
Wednesday, leaving little hope of an early resolution in its standoff
with Washington, Tokyo and Seoul.</LD>
<LD>   During two days of normalization talks between Japanese and North
Korean officials in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, North Korea
turned down Japan's request to end its uranium enrichment program.
And Japan turned down the impoverished Communist country's bid to
step up the talks that could lead to Tokyo's providing much-needed
aid and cash.</LD>
<LD>   "Negotiations will take a long time," said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a
North Korea expert with Takushoku University here.</LD>
<TE>   In a limited sign of progress, negotiators agreed to form a
technical panel on security issues, with a first meeting set for
November.</TE>
<TE>   Arrangements for the two-day talks in Malaysia, aimed at
establishing relations between the wary Northeast Asian neighbors,
were made before the news broke in mid-October that North Korea
admitted having a nuclear weapons program. Japan occupied the Korean
peninsula from 1910 to 1945, and the two have never set reparation
terms.</TE>
<TE>   With the Bush administration taking a hard line against North
Korea, hopes for a diplomatic resolution have shifted to third
parties -- initially, South Korea and Japan, but possibly China or
Russia further out -- as a way of altering the behavior of
authorities in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Washington has
refused to negotiate with the isolated, totalitarian state until
North Korea agrees to unilaterally abandon its nuclear ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Seoul tried 10 days ago during talks in Pyongyang to persuade
North Korea to back down, but that went nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two days, North Korea made clear that it welcomes
Japan's money but doesn't view Tokyo as a serious partner on weapons
discussions, preferring direct negotiations with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating matters between Japan and North Korea are the
13 Japanese whom Pyongyang recently admitted abducting to train spies
during the 1970s and '80s. This is the issue closest to Japan's
heart.</TE>
<TE>   When this week's normalization talks were scheduled in September,
senior Japanese and North Korean officials envisioned a quick trip
home by the five Japanese still alive, in return for the promise of
Japanese largess and full diplomatic relations.</TE>
<TE>   The five are currently in Japan visiting relatives, and Japan's
latest stance is that it won't send them back, insisting instead that
North Korea let their families join them. Pyongyang has rejected this
stand, accusing Tokyo of breaking its "promise" to return them and of
being too emotional. The issue can't compare with the brutal colonial
treatment it suffered under Japanese imperial rule, North Korea
added.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan is complicating the abduction issue due to their distrust
of us," North Korean delegate Pak Ryong Yeon said in Malaysia,
according to Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the nuclear standoff, Japanese public opinion had
soured on normalization as more information emerged about the deaths
of the eight others abducted by North Korea. Some of the deaths are
viewed with suspicion because they are blamed on suicide
asphyxiation, heart attacks involving people in their 20s and traffic
accidents in a country with few vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental question is whether North Korea has any interest
in a quick resolution of the nuclear issue. If Pyongyang follows its
past pattern, it will try to turn up the heat, not lower it, hoping
to spread fear and eventually to get paid to abandon its nuclear
ambitions, some analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the initial stage of a slowly developing crisis," said
Scott Snyder, Seoul representative of the Asia Foundation, speaking
at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Tokyo. As of now, "there's a
clear problem but no crisis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To create that crisis, Snyder said, North Korea might expel
several International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors still in the
country, then announce that it is retaking control of several
plutonium fuel rods mothballed under a 1994 agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Further escalation might involve transferring the rods -- enough
to make five or six plutonium weapons -- to one of its research labs
or enrichment facilities.</TE>
<TE>   And a fourth, ultimately desperate, step might be to test-fire
another rocket, like the August 1998 launch of a Taepodong ballistic
missile over Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Shigemura and Snyder said the much-touted unified stance toward
North Korea by Tokyo, Seoul and Washington is an illusion. South
Korea still believes it is possible to alter Pyongyang's behavior by
using economic leverage. Washington doesn't. Tokyo is probably
somewhere in between.</TE>
<TE>   Washington and Tokyo believe that coordination with Seoul will be
essentially impossible until at least December, when South Koreans go
to the polls. Washington discounts Seoul's so-called sunshine policy
as too accommodating to the North.</TE>
<TE>   Top Japanese and South Korean political leaders view improved
relations with the North as a way to boost their popularity back
home. Washington feels the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality of North Korea and the understanding of North Korea
in Seoul, Tokyo and Washington is very different," Shigemura said.</TE>

<HD>Fewer Americans Back War in Iraq, Surveys Find</HD>
<DH>As respondents indicate that the U.S. needs support from
allies before invading, Powell notes progress in U.N. negotiations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter and Doyle McManus</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After remaining steady for months, Americans' support for U.S.
military action in Iraq has softened in recent weeks, two polls
indicated Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The apparent drop in enthusiasm for war comes as U.S. officials
report progress in U.N. negotiations aimed at crafting a resolution
that would send weapons inspectors back to Iraq and possibly set the
stage for a U.S. invasion.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Wednesday that U.N.
Security Council members were getting much closer to agreeing on a
resolution and that he expects work to be completed before the end of
next week.</LD>
<TE>   Powell also said he believes it will take "a matter of months"
once inspections begin for U.N. weapons experts to determine whether
Iraq is producing weapons of mass destruction. His comments suggest
that any military action might not occur before late winter.</TE>
<TE>   A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center from Oct. 17 to Oct.
27 found that 55% of Americans support an attack on Iraq. That was
down from 62% earlier in the month and 64% in August.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found that a large percentage of Americans are worried
about the possible consequences of a military campaign, including
high U.S. casualties and increased terrorist attacks on the United
States. And it indicated that Americans are reluctant to back
military action unless the United States has support from allies.</TE>
<TE>   A poll by Fox News with slightly different wording found that
support for a military campaign had declined from 72% to 62% in
recent weeks. But a Gallup Poll conducted Oct. 21-22 showed no
decline.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll Doherty, editor at the Pew Research Center, said he
believes that the slippage is noteworthy after months of stability.
He said the dip may reflect the fact that President Bush has not been
actively campaigning recently to build nationwide support for
military action.</TE>
<TE>   John Gorman, president of Opinion Dynamics Corp., which conducted
the poll for Fox, said the decline may reflect the fact that news
coverage of the possible war with Iraq has evolved into a story about
U.N. diplomacy "that is inherently confusing. Without constant
reinforcement of the importance of this, support erodes."</TE>
<TE>   He said the erosion may also reflect, to a lesser extent, the fact
that opponents of the war have become more visible in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   The Pew poll, which sampled the views of 1,751 adults, found
increased opposition to the war among Democrats. For the first time
since the debate over the war intensified last summer, a minority of
Democrats, 49%, support the war.</TE>
<TE>   Like earlier polls, this survey suggested that Bush needs allied
support to keep U.S. public backing for an attack on Iraq.
Twenty-seven percent said they would favor military action if allies
did not go along, down from 33% in mid-September.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, officials continued to press forward in their
planning.</TE>
<TE>   Bush met for 10 minutes at the White House with chief U.N. weapons
inspector Hans Blix and Mohammed Baradei, head of the International
Atomic Energy Agency. Blix and Baradei also met with Powell, Vice
President Dick Cheney and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, described the
meetings as part of a round of consultations Blix is conducting in
the capitals of the five permanent members of the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, in an interview with National Public Radio, was asked how
long the United States would wait to see how inspections were faring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly a matter of months before Dr. Blix and ... Mr. El
Baradei would come back and say we have made our determination
whether or not [the Iraqis] are continuing to pursue this kind of
technology," Powell said. "We understand that it will take time, and
the president understands that means that we will have to wait for
them to do their work and complete their report."</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. official suggested this week that if the Security Council
appeared headed toward failure in its negotiations, the Bush
administration might delay the outcome until after election day -- to
avoid an embarrassing defeat, and heightened fears of war, just
before voters head to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   But other officials said the negotiations were still making
progress toward a compromise. They added that in any case, U.N.
negotiations almost always take longer than planned.</TE>

<HD>Japan Opts for Tepid Reform</HD>
<DH>After weeks of debate, the finance minister backs away from
threats of an economic overhaul to better account for the nation's
bad debts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>A monthlong battle in Japan that saw Financial Services Minister
Heizo Takenaka portrayed as a reformer, destroyer and ruthless
American wannabe ended with a whimper Wednesday when the government
unveiled another in a long string of watered-down economic reform
packages.</LD>
<LD>   Takenaka, 51, had threatened changes that would force a more
accurate reckoning of the nation's bad debts -- officially pegged at
$418 billion but in reality far higher, independent analysts say --
by instituting painful accounting changes, tightening capital
requirements, and even nationalizing banks and forcing out
incompetent bank managers.</LD>
<LD>   That's heady stuff in Japan, and the outcry from the political and
business establishment was fast and furious; the toned-down nature of
Wednesday's announcement gave some indication of the tire tracks left
on Takenaka's back.</LD>
<TE>   Under the amended plan, accounting changes were put off
indefinitely, the idea of nationalizing banks was dropped, and loans
and subsidies were extended to small companies to cushion future
pain.</TE>
<TE>   "The results are just a big back-off," said Ayako Mitsui,
economist with the investment banking firm UBS Warburg. "Most
investors were disappointed to see those trying to do the right thing
defeated."</TE>
<TE>   Markets took it in stride. The benchmark Nikkei index closed
Wednesday at 8,756.59, up 47.83 points, on a day the central bank
also eased monetary policy. Today, the market opened lower at
8,682.56, down 74.03.</TE>
<TE>   In a reform tussle that Japanese media characterized as a battle
between the nation's old and new guards, Takenaka showed some of the
mettle needed to become a white knight. But ultimately he had too
little clout or political support.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his proposed reforms were fairly orthodox, at least
outside Japan's borders. But the author and former professor has
little political experience and lacked the decades of back-room
dealing required to get things done here. He also could have used
more support from his boss, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to push a plan while you're being fired on from
all sides," said Kazuo Mizuno, chief economist with Mitsubishi
Securities. "The main issue here is rebuilding Japan, and something
as significant as arguably nationalizing banks should be done by the
prime minister himself."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said a related problem is that Koizumi may not understand
economics all that well.</TE>
<TE>   Takenaka downplayed criticism that Wednesday's plan involved too
much compromise. "There are those who say it was watered down," he
said. "But I believe it was an achievement by grappling a problem
that's been lingering for 10 years in one month."</TE>
<TE>   As momentum built against Takenaka's reform plan in recent weeks,
he was labeled by tabloid newspapers as a believer in the American
"winner-take-all" approach -- not a compliment in Japan -- and
someone who enjoys real estate and stock speculation, also a less
than favorable characterization. "Takenaka Shock," said one headline.</TE>
<TE>   On other fronts, Takenaka had to battle top lawmakers from the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party who argued that he was an armchair
theorist, didn't understand the plight of small companies and picked
the wrong time to force banks into a corner. Not to be outdone, the
political opposition filed a censure motion against him in
parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's 12 leading banks also slammed his initial proposal, even
threatening to sue the government for attempting to change the rules
midstream, which they said risked causing a credit crunch and
economic collapse. The proposal that particularly angered them was
one that would have limited their ability to count deferred taxes as
part of their capital base.</TE>
<TE>   "Takenaka is learning what happens when reformers go up against
the massive inertia at the core of the political machine," said the
Asahi newspaper. "The results weren't pretty."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, analysts said, Takenaka's proposal threatened to break
apart the ruling coalition at a time when the appetite for change
seemed to be waning among voters. "Public opinion seemed to be split
between those in favor of radical change and those afraid for their
own jobs," said UBS' Mitsui.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether the dilution of Takenaka's proposals
will undercut his political effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Takenaka, a college professor with a schoolboy haircut, grew up in
Wakayama, a city of 400,000 on Japan's main island. He embraced the
dismal science after seeing his father, a shoe store owner, work hard
for so little while others seemed to slide by easily, the minister
said in a 2000 book he co-wrote called "So That's What Economics Is
About."</TE>
<TE>   Kazuaki Fujishiro, 52, a fellow student of Takenaka's at Toin High
School, remembers him as persistent, popular and someone who rarely
seemed to study but remained near the top of his class.</TE>
<TE>   "I never at the time imagined he'd be so successful," Fujishiro
said. "I respect him for taking on the minister's job given how much
resistance he knew he'd face."</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Tokyo's Hitotsubashi University, Takenaka
worked for eight years at what is now the Development Bank of Japan
before spending a decade bouncing back and forth between the United
States and Japan. He was a visiting scholar at Harvard University and
the University of Pennsylvania in 1981, where he reportedly warmed to
supply-side economics, which was just gaining attention during the
Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   Upon returning from the U.S., he spent several years in Japan's
Finance Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, he became a visiting assistant professor at Harvard
before returning to Japan to teach at prestigious Keio University,
leading to a full professorship in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Takenaka, a reformer armed with easy-to-understand arguments, soon
became a fixture on news programs and at symposiums. He once blamed
Japan's decade-long economic slump on "a society that doesn't have a
system to destroy, only to protect."</TE>
<TE>   At some point as his national profile grew, he attracted the
attention of Koizumi.</TE>

<HD>Gap Is Closing on Iraq Resolution, Briton Says</HD>
<DH>'A lot of interesting debate' has given Foreign Secretary
Jack Straw hope that France and Russia will be persuaded soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Weeks of tough negotiations at the United Nations over a proposed
U.S.-British resolution on Iraq have achieved a "very, very
significant closing of the gap," British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we probably will be able to resolve the matter," Straw
said in an interview here. "There's been a lot of very interesting
debate. I wouldn't put a specific time schedule on it. Could be next
week. Could be the week after that."</LD>
<LD>   France and Russia, which hold permanent Security Council seats
along with the United States, Britain and China, have resisted any
resolution that would allow the United States to take automatic
military action against the Iraqi regime if Baghdad refuses to rid
itself of any weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   Straw's words and tone echoed the cautious optimism expressed by
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other diplomats as the
deal-making process accelerates at the U.N. Saying he is immersed in
discussions involving numerous phone conversations each day with
other key players in the debate, the British foreign secretary
described a process that appears to be zeroing in on final
significant details.</TE>
<TE>   The essence of the debate has boiled down to not what to do about
Iraq, but who should decide it. The U.S. still claims the right to
attack the country if the U.N. doesn't take action. With British
help, however, France and the U.S. are discussing a compromise that
would require Washington to consult with the Security Council after
reports of any Iraqi violation of a new resolution -- though not be
bound by the council's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The latest proposal zinging between Paris and Washington adds
French amendments to emphasize that only the council can decide
whether violations by Iraq would constitute "a further material
breach" -- and initiate the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   France had worried that the U.S. would use other mentions of
material breach in the text as a "hidden trigger" for an attack.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never be certain about these things," Straw said. "If I
was certain, then the agreement would be there. And when you have the
final stages of the negotiation, they are always the most difficult.
But my sense is that the [five permanent Security Council] members
want to reach an agreement. My own sense is there's a widespread
recognition of the need for action to be taken by the United
Nations."</TE>
<TE>   If the council eventually crafts an agreement, Britain will have
helped to pull off a delicate diplomatic feat: endorsing a hard-line
U.S. policy toward Iraq while steering that policy through the United
Nations as urged by France and other nations worried about unchecked
U.S. power.</TE>
<TE>   In comments in Parliament on Wednesday, Prime Minister Tony Blair
similarly held out hope for an accord and rejected a legislator's
assertion that Powell had demanded a U.N. decision by the end of the
week. Withstanding political heat from Britons who are dubious about
a war against Iraq, the Blair government has served as a kind of
bridge between the U.S. -- seen by European critics as a lone
gunslinger eager for war -- and the international community during
the U.N. debate.</TE>
<TE>   Straw's role has been crucial. Despite the red-eyed pace of the
past weeks, he seemed relaxed Wednesday. He joked that the
painstaking business of crafting the U.N. resolution has filled his
head with the stilted official language of the texts.</TE>
<TE>   Another French proposal for the compromise resolution tries to
distinguish Iraq's "material breach" in the past from a possible
breach in the future, to clarify that only a new violation can
trigger action. The result is an awkward phrase opening the
resolution's first operative paragraph: "As long as this resolution
remains unimplemented...." British diplomats, masters of the art of
drafting, have been trying to find a more graceful solution.</TE>
<TE>   "I wake up rehearsing various operative paragraphs," Straw said,
chuckling. "How do you move from the conditional to the future of
French for that word?"</TE>
<TE>   Straw, 56, became Britain's top diplomat last year after serving
as home secretary, the nation's top law enforcement official, since
1997. The unflappable and bespectacled Cabinet minister became
internationally known in 1998 when he oversaw the convoluted case of
Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator who was arrested by
British police on a Spanish warrant and then sent home after 16
months in legal limbo.</TE>
<TE>   On Iraq, Straw has staked out a firmly pro-U.S. position while
articulating a policy that differs quietly from the Bush
administration on certain points. The Blair government has stopped
short of joining President Bush's combative talk about bringing down
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Our objective is the disarmament of Saddam Hussein's regime and
not regime change itself," Straw said. "We would prefer that, of
course, but it is not the objective we are seeking in the United
Nations."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Bush, who categorized Iran and North Korea as part
of an unholy trio of rogue states in his "axis of evil" speech this
year, the British government has cultivated dialogue with Tehran
because of Iran's size and strategic importance.</TE>
<TE>   Britain wants to encourage reform elements struggling for control
of the Iranian government, Straw said. He has consulted with Iranian
leaders about the repercussions of a potential confrontation between
a U.S.-led coalition and Iraq, Iran's neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing out that one or two Iranians die each day from the
lingering effects of Iraqi poison gas attacks in the 1980s, Straw
said, "They and Kuwait know more about the brutal nature of the
Saddam regime than anybody in the world except for Saddam's own
citizens."</TE>
<TE>   As for North Korea's admission that it concealed its nuclear
weapons program, Straw said Britain agrees with the United States
that the problem calls for a diplomatic approach. The difference with
Iraq is that North Korea has disclosed its transgressions to the
international community, he said in response to critics who say the
U.S.-British policy has been inconsistent in regard to the two
nations.</TE>
<TE>   "Korea has now made a disclosure ... of major importance of that
which previously they had denied," he said. "So we are in a very
different position in terms of dealing with North Korea other than
through use of force than we are with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "And if the Iraqi regime could do what North Korea has now done,
which was to make a full disclosure or move toward a full disclosure,
then the circumstances would really be very different."</TE>

<HD>EU Alleges Mob Ties to Tobacco</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein and Myron Levin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Union accused tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds in a lawsuit
Wednesday of selling black-market cigarettes to drug traffickers and
mobsters, helping them launder profits from their illegal activities.</LD>
<LD>   The 149-page complaint describes in detail Reynolds' allegedly
corrupt business dealings in Europe and Latin America, including with
members of the Italian Mafia and Russian organized crime, Colombian
drug cartels and high government officials in the Balkans.</LD>
<LD>   RJR executives "at the highest corporate level" made it "part of
their operating business plan to sell cigarettes to and through
criminal organizations and to accept criminal proceeds in payments
for cigarettes by secret and surreptitious means," the suit alleges.</LD>
<TE>   The complaint was filed late Wednesday, and RJR spokesman Seth
Moskowitz said the company could not fully respond before reviewing
it. "However, at first glance it appears that this complaint is
related" to a case "which has been dismissed," Moskowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit continues the EU's legal assault on Reynolds and other
tobacco companies that it claims have cheated member states of
billions of taxes over the years through collusion with smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   The EU's earlier complaint against RJR and Philip Morris Cos. was
dismissed in February by a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., on
grounds that it was barred by the "revenue rule," a centuries-old
common-law doctrine that generally prohibits foreign governments from
collecting tax defaults through U.S. courts. The EU has appealed the
dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis
said he would consider a suit based on money-laundering violations,
rather than tax recovery. In response, the EU filed this suit and is
expected to file a similar suit against Philip Morris and Japan
Tobacco Inc. in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   The suit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn paints
a world in which contraband cigarettes have become the currency of
choice in Europe for money laundering -- and where one of the world's
major tobacco companies allegedly aided and abetted the criminals.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit lists bank accounts in Switzerland, Italy, Cyprus,
Liechtenstein, the Isle of Jersey and the Netherlands and identifies
wire transfers used as part of money-laundering schemes.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also asserts that RJR entities frequently changed banks
where the company was going to receive payments from illicit sales to
escape detection by U.S. law enforcement. "This process was known
within RJR as 'musical banks,' " according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the earlier suit, the complaint does not seek
recovery of lost tax revenue or customs duties, because the judge
found such claims were barred. Instead, it seeks alleged losses
resulting from money laundering, including law enforcement
expenditures and other costs. The complaint does not ask for a
specific amount of damages, but it says the EU's losses are in the
hundreds of millions.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit presents a purported marriage of convenience between
tobacco executives seeking to expand their markets in Europe and
criminal gangs needing to launder profits from narcotics and weapons
trafficking and extortion, and accomplishing this through the
purchase and sale of RJR brands.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout the European community, cigarettes and narcotics are
routinely part of the same criminal transactions, and the incidence
of such violence associated with such trade is rising rapidly around
the world," the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout the 1990s and continuing to the present day, a primary
means by which ... cocaine proceeds are laundered is through the
purchase and sale of cigarettes, including those manufactured by the
RJR defendants. Cocaine sales in the European community are
facilitated through money-laundering operations in Colombia, Panama,
Switzerland and elsewhere, which utilize RJR cigarettes as the
money-laundering vehicle," the suit asserts.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the suit contends that RJR cigarettes are used as a
money-laundering vehicle for heroin sales in the European Community.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations are unusually stark and detailed, in contrast to
many civil lawsuits that lay out charges in a general form with few
specifics.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed by three U.S. law firms, but they drew upon
information gathered by law enforcement in Italy and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   The suit asserts that RJR's motivation for dealing with criminal
organizations was to increase its market share. RJR has benefited
from these illicit relations by increasing sales and profit margins
"because they require the criminals to pay a premium for their
cigarettes and/or subject the criminals to sales and credit terms
that are more favorable to [RJR] than those granted to legitimate
customers," the suit states.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other allegations in the lawsuit, RJR moved its
cigarettes through the Balkans in the 1990s by means of illicit
payments to corrupt government officials, including the current
president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, and the deceased former
head of the Montenegro's Foreign Investment Agency, Milutin Lalic.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says payments came from a company founded by Italian
organized crime figures that had the official sanction of the
investment agency and operated under the protection of Djukanovic.
The company, Montenegrin Tabak Transit, was granted exclusive rights
to move cigarettes through the Port of Montenegro, and over time made
millions of dollars in payments to members of the Yugoslav federal
government and Montenegrin regional governments, including Djukanovic
and Lilic, the lawsuit states.</TE>
<TE>   It says RJR executives and distributors were well aware that such
"licensing fees" were being paid to facilitate the movement of their
brands. They "traveled to Montenegro on a regular basis to inspect
their cigarettes and service their customers and, as such, were well
aware of these practices," the lawsuit states.</TE>
<TE>   According to European press reports, Italian authorities have
opened a criminal investigation into alleged involvement by
Djukanovic with Mafia-run smuggling operations. Djukanovic has denied
any involvement with the contraband trade.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also alleges that throughout the 1990s and continuing to
this day, RJR has violated U.S. trade sanctions against Iraq by
shipping billions of cigarettes into that country through
intermediaries.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, those profiting from the trade include
Uday Hussein, the son of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, and the PKK, a
Kurdish independence group based in northern Iraq that the U.S. has
classified as a terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   For most of this time the cigarettes followed a circuitous route
from an RJR plant in Puerto Rico to European ports, and on through
Cyprus to Turkey, where they were trucked across the border into
Iraq, the suit states.</TE>
<TE>   Although Japan Tobacco acquired RJR's international business for
$8 billion in 1999, the lawsuit says RJR remained involved in this
trade at least through May 2001 under a "transitional services
agreement" with Japan Tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations of illegal trade with Iraq also are the subject of
a criminal investigation by U.S. authorities. As The Times reported
in May, the probe is being conducted by the U.S. Customs Service and
the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most stunning allegations in the suit was that RJR
entities participated in and "received the proceeds of a massive
money-laundering scheme through the Bank of New York." That bank was
at the center of a federal investigation of Russian money laundering
in the U.S. in the 1990s, which led to indictments and guilty pleas
of a bank vice president and her husband. But until this suit was
filed, there never had been any public allegation that RJR was
connected to this scandal.</TE>
<TE>   According to the new suit, the money-laundering scheme was created
by Russian organized crime, including narcotics traffickers. In the
scheme, a group of bank entities, some legitimate and some
fabricated, opened correspondent accounts with the Bank of New York.
Through the correspondent banks and the Bank of New York, the suit
alleges, Russian criminals were able to launder hundreds of millions
of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "The RJR defendants were the prime beneficiaries of this
money-laundering enterprise," receiving millions of dollars per month
in payments through the Bank of New York that constituted the
proceeds of Russian organized crime, including narcotics trafficking,
the suit alleges. EU lawyers contend that RJR executives "knew or
should have known" that the money RJR was receiving through the bank
was the fruit of illicit enterprises and was being illegally
laundered.</TE>
<TE>   "In spite of this fact," RJR continued for years to sell
cigarettes to these customers and received criminal proceeds in New
York, the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contends that RJR executives at all times "were well
aware that they were laundering the proceeds of criminal activities"
and that they went to great lengths to conduct these activities in a
surreptitious manner.</TE>

<HD>Simon Resists Calls to Attack</HD>
<DH>With his advisors split into two camps, the GOP candidate
has hesitated to play up accusations by a convicted racketeer against
Gov. Davis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Finnegan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With five days left to make his case to voters, Republican Bill Simon
Jr. is resisting the advice of top aides to close his race for
governor with a harsh new attack on fund-raising by Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The struggle within Simon's campaign over strategy for the final
days of the race comes as polls show he faces a steep challenge in
overcoming the Democratic governor's solid lead among key voting
blocs.</LD>
<LD>   Simon's chief strategist, Ed Rollins, and others have pushed for a
scathing new television ad that would include a convicted racketeer's
newly disclosed accusations against Davis, Republicans with knowledge
of the discussions said.</LD>
<TE>   But for two days, Simon has hesitated even to discuss the
allegations of improper fund-raising in public, much less put them in
a TV spot.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's reticence underscores his other option: closing out his
campaign by moving away from attacks on Davis and emphasizing instead
a positive agenda on schools, energy and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   To make such a shift so close to election day would pose a vexing
question for Simon: After eight months of weathering a brutal ad
assault by Davis, is it too late for the novice GOP candidate to
introduce himself to voters on his own terms?</TE>
<TE>   Even some Republicans say that although Simon is unlikely to win
without promoting his own agenda, neither can he get it across in the
limited time left. GOP strategist Mike Madrid said Simon -- running
well behind Davis among women, independents, moderates, Latinos and
other key voting groups -- has no choice but to pound the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't introduce yourself eight days before the election," he
said. "What you do is go negative and hope that suppresses turnout of
your opponent's supporters."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign for governor this year has been defined almost from
the start by angry attacks and advertising like that under
consideration by the Simon campaign. Davis spent nearly $10 million
during the Republican primary to blunt the candidacy of Richard
Riordan, the former Los Angeles mayor, and having done that, has
continued the approach against Simon.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the campaign, Simon has lacked the resources to
counter Davis' message. But he has aired a substantial number of ads,
nearly all of them critical of Davis, in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign has long been split into rival camps. One, led by
Rollins and campaign manager Rob Lapsley, has advocated hard-charging
tactics. Another, led by strategist Sal Russo, has pushed for a more
cautious approach that emphasizes Simon's optimistic personal style.</TE>
<TE>   Tactics aside, Simon has framed the campaign as a referendum on
Davis. For months, the main theme of his TV advertising and public
remarks has been that Davis is a failed governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis spent California into a budget crisis," Simon said
Wednesday at a campaign stop in Sacramento. "Whether we're talking
about energy, our economy or our schools, we must recognize that all
these three things are casualties of his mismanagement of our state's
finances."</TE>
<TE>   Day after day, Simon has singled out Davis' ethics as his biggest
flaw, saying state policy is for sale to campaign donors. "Under Gray
Davis," Simon says in his latest TV spot, "corruption went up."</TE>
<TE>   The battle within Simon's campaign over how far to pursue the
ethics attack was triggered Monday by a federal judge's unsealing of
court records on allegations leveled against Davis by a convicted
felon, Mark L. Nathanson.</TE>
<TE>   Nathanson, a former state coastal commissioner convicted in a
corruption scandal, told prosecutors in 1993 and 1994 that Davis had
asked for names of people who got oceanfront building permits so
Davis could ask them for campaign money.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors found Nathanson had no credibility and concluded there
was no evidence of a crime. Davis has denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours after the records were released, Simon demanded that
Davis respond to Nathanson's accusations. Surrounded by a cluster of
reporters and TV crews he had called to a beach in Malibu, Simon
said: "Mr. Davis should reveal his calendars and notes from all
meetings and interactions that he has had with Mr. Nathanson."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon all but abandoned the matter at campaign stops Tuesday
and Wednesday, saying nothing about it until prompted by reporters.
Asked why he had dropped the topic, Simon simply repeated his remarks
from Monday, offering nothing to push the story forward.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill does not feel comfortable with Nathanson," a Simon advisor
said. "He has not wanted to push it."</TE>
<TE>   To some Republican strategists inside and outside his campaign,
the Nathanson case offered Simon just the last-minute break he
needed. And in an era when campaign TV ads can be produced and put on
the air within hours, they are baffled that days have passed without
a Simon spot on Nathanson.</TE>
<TE>   "In an ideal world, a candidate could close his campaign with a
positive, uplifting vision for California's future," said GOP
strategist Dan Schnur, who is not working for Simon. "But when you're
running behind with five days to go, and a federal judge unwraps a
gift like this one on your front doorstep, you have to take advantage
of it."</TE>
<TE>   "It may not be the ideal way to close out a campaign, but it's by
far their best opportunity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, some Simon advisors, including Rollins and
Lapsley, have pushed for an ad that includes Nathanson's charges,
Republicans said. The campaign has had at least one in production
this week, but Simon declined Wednesday to say if he would put it on
the air.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like we're caught in no-man's land," said one Republican
affiliated with the campaign. "The candidate and the campaign are
treading water."</TE>
<TE>   Summing up Simon's closing strategy, a campaign spokesman, Sean
Walsh, said: "We must remind voters that Gray Davis is a corrupt and
failed governor, and at the same time demonstrate that Bill Simon has
a vision and a plan on the issues they care about: education, jobs
and the economy, energy."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Davis has been airing an ad trying to undermine Simon's
credibility with quotes from newspaper stories on his earlier false
accusation that Davis had engaged in illegal campaign fund-raising.
At the Griffith Observatory on Wednesday, Davis cast even Simon's
minimal use of the Nathanson matter so far as "dirty tricks."</TE>
<TE>   "It's really pathetic that in the closing days of the campaign
that Mr. Simon has no vision," Davis said. "All he wants to do is
attack me."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some Republican strategists have little faith that even a
Nathanson ad can help Simon recover from his campaign blunders and
setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Dresner, a pollster for former GOP Gov. Pete Wilson, said
most voters already consider Davis a "sleazeball." So it might be
best, he said, for Simon to shift the focus to his own agenda, even
if it has little hope of leading to victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't think that either strategy works here," Dresner
said. "Simon's problem is that he's run a dismal campaign."</TE>

<HD>Church's Sex Abuse Policy Is Revised</HD>
<DH>Team of U.S. bishops and Vatican officials rework
'zero-tolerance' rules. The speed of the agreement catches some by
surprise.</DH>

<LD>The Vatican and a team of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have agreed on
revisions to the American "zero-tolerance" policy on sexual abuse
that will settle Vatican concerns about protecting the rights of
accused priests, church officials announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement, coming after just two days of closed-door
meetings at the Vatican, caught many American Catholic leaders by
surprise.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the revisions were not made public or immediately given
either to the U.S. bishops as a whole or to Gov. Frank Keating of
Oklahoma, chairman of the bishops National Review Board on sexual
abuse, which is charged with overseeing the implementation of the
U.S. policy.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the four U.S. bishops who negotiated the revisions with
four Vatican officials plan to present them to the full U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops for approval when the group meets in
Washington for a regularly scheduled meeting Nov. 11. The U.S.
bishops approved the zero-tolerance policy, formally known as the
Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People, at a special
meeting in Dallas in June.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Francis George of Chicago, one of the negotiators, sought
to reassure American Catholics that the "goals" of protecting minors
and punishing abusive priests remain in place. At the same time, he
said in a written statement released in Rome, the revisions would
meet the Vatican's concerns that the U.S. policy as originally
written could abridge the rights of priests that are set out in the
church's canon law.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the goals of the Dallas decision, i.e. to protect
minors and to reach out to victims, have been preserved and that the
Dallas documents have been completed in elaborating normative
procedures that respect the rights of priests who have been accused,"
George's statement said.</TE>
<TE>   A confidential fax announcing the agreement was dispatched Tuesday
to all U.S. bishops by Bishop Wilton T. Gregory, president of the
bishops conference. A bishop who received the fax said it contained
no details but characterized its tone as "upbeat."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a spokeswoman in the U.S. bishops office in
Washington, said there had been no drastic rewriting of the Dallas
policy. The fact that the joint commission completed its work in just
two days meant that "there was not a lot of work that had to be
done," Walsh said. "They were tweaking the norms."</TE>
<TE>   But the speed of the negotiations and the secrecy surrounding them
are causing advocates for victims of sexual abuse to worry. The fact
that the eight-member commission had finished its work in just two
days of Vatican meetings was "not a good sign," said David Clohessy
of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   "We obviously argued that the U.S. bishops should fight tooth and
nail to preserve the Dallas charter, and it was pretty clear the
Vatican wanted it weakened," Clohessy said. "We're just pessimistic."</TE>
<TE>   "It's creative and desperate spin-doctoring going on to define
these changes as tweaking rather than substantive changes," Clohessy
said. "I'd love to be proven wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Others cautioned against reading too much into the speed of the
talks. In Chicago, Father Andrew Greeley, a Catholic columnist and
author who early on was an outspoken critic of the bishops' handling
of the sexual abuse crisis, said he took Cardinal George at his word
that the policy had not been greatly weakened.</TE>
<TE>   "They couldn't have had too much to argue about," Greeley said. "I
don't see Francis George backing off from the basic premises."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. bishops approved their zero-tolerance policy in the midst of
a sexual abuse scandal that has engulfed the church in the United
States. As many as 300 priests have either been removed from ministry
or have retired early after accusations that they had sexually abused
minors. Dozens nationwide are now facing prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis has cost dioceses millions of dollars in legal fees and
settlements with the victims. At the Dallas meeting, bishops said the
accusations that the church hierarchy had failed to protect children
from sexual predators -- often moving accused priests from one
diocese to another -- had eroded their moral credibility. Many
bishops and priests have called the crisis the worst ever to face the
church in America.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas charter said that any "credible" accusation of sexual
abuse of a minor -- past, present or future -- by any priest, deacon
or other church worker would result in the accused person being
immediately removed from the ministry.</TE>
<TE>   If the accusation proves groundless, the accused person can be
restored to the ministry. But any church worker who admits to abuse
or is found guilty is to be permanently removed from ministry.
Priests would also be subject to being ousted from the priesthood,
known in the church as being removed from the clerical state.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. bishops have been free to voluntarily implement the policy,
and several, including Cardinal Roger M. Mahony in Los Angeles and
Bishop Tod D. Brown in Orange County, have said they would do so. But
in order to make the policy mandatory for all dioceses, it must be
approved by the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials, along with some leading U.S. canon lawyers,
raised questions from the start. The Vatican said it was concerned
that the due process rights of priests were being abridged. Officials
also questioned the U.S. bishops' stated intention to remove priests
from the ministry, even those who had led an exemplary life for many
years after a decades-old transgression.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Vatican officials objected to the expanded role of
U.S. lay Catholics envisioned by the Dallas charter. The charter
created sexual abuse review committees in all dioceses and said lay
Catholics should hold a majority on those panels. The committees were
to advise bishops on how to handle accused priests and oversee local
sexual abuse prevention policies. The Vatican wanted assurances that
the "proper role" of lay-dominated boards did not infringe on the
authority of a bishop.</TE>
<TE>   A third problem, in the view of Vatican officials, was the U.S.
policy's broad definition of what constitutes sexual abuse, one that
goes beyond the definition in many states' civil laws.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Vatican officials said they could not approve
the policy as written. The Vatican proposed the joint U.S.-Vatican
commission and said it would bring the U.S. policy into conformity
with the canon law that governs the church worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the Vatican took pains at the time to emphasize that
it was in "full solidarity" with the efforts by the American church
to end sexual abuse of minors, to come to the aid of victims and
their families, and to discipline priests, deacons and other church
workers. The Vatican called the sexual abuse of minors "particularly
abhorrent."</TE>

<HD>Getty Closing In on Acquiring Last Raphael in Private Hands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The J. Paul Getty Museum, outbid three months ago in its efforts to
land a coveted Rubens painting, is one step from closing a deal to
buy another Old Master: Raphael's "Madonna of the Pinks."</LD>
<LD>   The 16th century painting, whose price is estimated at $50
million, is considered the last undisputed work by the artist in
private hands.</LD>
<LD>   Getty director Deborah Gribbon, who declined to discuss the
purchase price, said the museum has agreed to buy the work from the
trustees of an English estate, the 10th Duke of Northumberland Wills
Trust, but still faces a review by the British government concerning
whether it will let the work out of the country.</LD>
<TE>   "There are no more [undisputed] Raphaels out there. This is the
end," said New York-based art dealer Richard Feigen, who met with the
sellers last year and was among those who estimated the painting's
price tag at $50 million. Feigen has bid on works at auction for the
Getty in the past, but he said he is not directly involved in the
Raphael purchase.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed purchase opens a new chapter in the life of an
artwork that migrated from Italy to England, was dismissed as a copy
and forgotten for decades, and was then rediscovered. Along with
Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, said Gribbon, "Raphael is
certainly one of the three most important Renaissance artists. So
this work would be a real keystone of that part of the collection."</TE>
<TE>   "Something like this is a real treasure," said Gloria Williams,
curator at Pasadena's Norton Simon Museum. Although many works are
attributed to "school of" Raphael or "after" Raphael, she said, the
Norton Simon owns the only other Raphael painting in the state,
"Madonna With Child and Book," painted in 1502-03.</TE>
<TE>   Art historians and dealers say the Getty's deal interrupts a rough
patch for museums worldwide, which in recent years have often found
themselves too poor to compete with a new generation of art-acquiring
plutocrats.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent such contest came on July 10 at Sotheby's in
London. Canadian newspaper mogul Ken Thomson paid an estimated $76.7
million to outbid the Getty for Rubens' "Massacre of the Innocents."
In that case, Feigen said, he represented the Getty, had a limit of
$71 million, and found that three private buyers were in contention
for the Rubens.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates outbid all others in
acquiring Winslow Homer's "Lost on the Grand Banks" for $36 million,
then the most paid for an American painting. Four years before that,
Gates purchased Leonardo's 72-page Codex Leicester manuscript for
$30.8 million from the cash-strapped UCLA Hammer Museum..</TE>
<TE>   Even when they might have enough money, "it's very difficult for
museums to get their act together in time to bid," said Old Master
specialist Paul Jeromack, a consultant for the Art Newspaper. "They
have to get approval from trustees, they have to raise money."</TE>
<TE>   But the Getty's wealth sets it apart, Jeromack said.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's Renaissance holdings are a relatively modest part of
an overall collection whose greatest strengths are works from
antiquity, 19th century painting, photography and medieval
manuscripts. The Getty collection does include two drawings by
Leonardo and one by Michelangelo. Its Renaissance paintings include
Fra Bartolommeo's 1509 work "Flight Into Egypt" and Andrea Mantegna's
"Adoration of the Magi" from circa 1495-1505.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe Raphael painted the 29-by-23-centimeter
"Madonna of the Pinks" in 1507 or 1508, drawing inspiration from a
Leonardo painting known as the Benois Madonna, which now hangs in the
Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. In the Raphael version,
the Madonna is seated with the Christ child, who plays with flowers
on her lap while a distant castle stands visible through a window.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the 20th century, "Madonna of the Pinks" was
considered an accomplished copy, until Nicholas Penny, then a curator
with London's National Gallery (and now at the National Gallery in
Washington, D.C.), rediscovered and reassessed it in 1983. For much
of the last decade, it has been on loan to the National Gallery in
London, which has displayed it along with several other Raphaels.</TE>
<TE>   Gribbon said that the purchase agreement follows nearly a year of
talks, and that a schedule for the export-review process had not yet
been set. Getty officials are hoping that the other Raphaels in the
London museum's collection will help persuade British authorities
that the Getty acquisition would make only a modest dent in that
nation's cultural holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "Works by Raphael are almost as rare as works by Leonardo and
Michelangelo, so it's a great coup to buy one of these," said J.
Patrice Marandel, chief curator of European painting and sculpture
for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Like Feigen, Marandel said
he expects the deal to survive the British government's
export-license review.</TE>
<TE>   Under that process, the British Department for Culture, Media, and
Sport's Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art decides if
a work is of particular historic or national importance. If the panel
finds that it is, the British government can delay a transaction for
several months, effectively giving British buyers a chance to match
the proposed purchase price.</TE>
<TE>   In the last dozen years, Gribbon said, the Getty has navigated
this process many times, with more successes than failures, but
perhaps a dozen failures nevertheless. The last such disappointment,
Getty officials said, came in 2000 when the museum was blocked in a
bid to acquire a Roman gem from antiquity.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we might say, thank God the economy is not so good,"
LACMA's Marandel said. "And I think the British museums are in such
financial trouble right now, it's unlikely that they would be able to
raise the money. Also, they cannot really argue that [Raphael] is not
represented in their collections."</TE>
<TE>   The purchase, Feigen said, is "exactly what the Getty ought to be
doing. It's very smart to convert a bunch of pieces of green paper
into a masterpiece. The green paper proliferates. The masterpieces
evaporate."</TE>

<HD>Bush Urges Judicial Process Changes</HD>
<DH>He wants deadlines for considering U.S. court nominees.
Timing of proposal is criticized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Frustrated by Senate delays in considering his federal court
nominees, President Bush on Wednesday proposed overhauling the
judicial nomination process, setting specific deadlines for the
Senate to act on each candidate.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, which would make the first such changes in the
nomination process since Jimmy Carter was president, would require
the cooperation of both the Senate and the federal judges who plan to
retire.</LD>
<LD>   The timing of the announcement -- six days before the
congressional elections -- and the limited consultation that the
White House conducted with the Senate left critics saying that it was
a politically motivated measure rather than one likely to have a
lasting effect.</LD>
<TE>   Under Bush's plan, judges on U.S. district and appeals courts
would be asked to notify the White House of their retirement date one
year in advance. By custom, the judges, who have lifetime
appointments, generally provide a six-month notification.</TE>
<TE>   The president would submit a nomination within 180 days after
learning of a vacancy. The Senate Judiciary Committee would have 90
days to conduct a hearing on the nominee, and the Senate would vote
on the nomination within 180 days after its submission.</TE>
<TE>   Calling his plan "a clean start" to a process that has become
mired in politics and acrimony, Bush said: "We must have an
evenhanded, predictable procedure from the day a vacancy is announced
to the day a new judge is sworn in.</TE>
<TE>   "This procedure should apply now and in the future, no matter who
lives in this house or who controls the Senate. We must return
fairness and dignity to the judicial confirmation process."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal follows a series of measures offered by the White
House in the closing days of the political campaign dealing with such
concerns as pension reform, embryo research and prescription drugs
for the elderly -- issues that hold special appeal to either the
president's conservative supporters or other constituent groups.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the sharpest criticisms of the judicial proposal came from
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the Senate Judiciary Committee
chairman. He and the White House have been tangling for months over
the pace of Senate work on court nominees.</TE>
<TE>   "The White House repeatedly has chosen to continue down its path
of trying to politicize the process," Leahy said. "The timing and
handling of this unilateral White House proposal, a week before the
elections, and after ignoring all previous invitations to consult
with the Senate, cannot help but raise questions about its purpose."</TE>
<TE>   However, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the timing
of the proposal only supported his contention that politics had not
come into play.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that it was announced this week underscores the
nonpolitical nature of it," he said. "If it was a political
announcement, you would think the White House would have withheld it
until after the elections, to see who won."</TE>
<TE>   The senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen.
Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, offered terse praise. An aide said, "We
support it," adding that Hatch would have no other comment.</TE>
<TE>   In campaign appearances in recent weeks, Bush has taken to
chastising the Senate, where Democrats hold a one-seat majority, over
what he has called a vacancy "crisis" because seats on federal
district and appeals courts are unfilled.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 849 authorized federal judgeships, the White House said, 79
are vacant.</TE>
<TE>   But there is sharp disagreement over where the responsibility for
the vacancies lies. The president argues that the Democrats are
applying inappropriate ideological standards to his nominees, and
Democrats contend that they are moving faster than the Republican-led
Senate did on President Clinton's nominations.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Bush said: "We will not find a solution in an
endless cycle of blame and bitterness."</TE>
<TE>   He complained that the Senate had voted on only three of the first
11 nominees he submitted for positions in the appeals courts. The
nominations were announced May 9, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy responded that the Judiciary Committee has voted on 100
nominees for various courts, approving 98 of them, in the 15 months
since Democrats have been in the majority.</TE>
<TE>   "We have done more in 15 months than our predecessors did in 30
months," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But there is agreement within the legal community that the process
could move faster and, said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political
science at the University of Massachusetts, "both parties share
equally" in the blame for the delays.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want real reform, it requires both parties to acknowledge
they have sinned and to make a truly bipartisan effort to reform the
process," said Goldman, author of a study of the way federal judges
have been chosen since the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   The American Bar Assn. offered a qualified endorsement of Bush's
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Alfred P. Carlton Jr., the organization's president, said in an
interview that the White House deserved "an A for effort," but that
the Senate's handling of judicial nominees is now "moving along." He
said he needed time to consider the specifics of the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal represents the first White House effort to speed up
the process since Carter created a nominating commission for the
federal bench. That process was dismantled by President Reagan.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Imposes New Rule on Sea Containers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Customs Service said Wednesday it will require sea carriers
to provide details of the contents of containers destined for this
country 24 hours before the cargo is loaded onto ships at foreign
ports.</LD>
<LD>   The agency's new rule marks its latest effort to prevent
terrorists from bringing nuclear and other deadly weapons into the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   "Terrorist organizations pose an immediate and substantial threat
to the global trading system," said Customs Commissioner Robert C.
Bonner. "With this rule, customs can better protect the American
people and the global trading system as a whole from the threat of
nuclear terror using sea containers."</LD>
<TE>   Companies that fail to provide accurate manifest information 24
hours before loading would be subject to fines under the rule.
Bonner, however, has said customs also can prevent a company from
unloading a cargo container, an option at its disposal to penalize
violators.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a noncompliant sea carrier from entering a U.S. port would
be "highly unlikely," said customs spokesman Dennis Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   Customs said the regulation won't apply to ships carrying bulk
cargo, such as oil, grain, coal or lumber.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the manifest information that would have to be provided in
advance includes a precise description of each container's contents,
date of scheduled arrival in the U.S., the foreign port of departure,
shipper's name and address and vessel name and number, said Murphy.</TE>

<HD>Chemical Affecting Frogs' Sexuality</HD>
<DH>Males are acquiring female attributes after exposure to a
common weedkiller, study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Green</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Male leopard frogs in several states are acquiring female sexual
attributes as a result of exposure to atrazine, one of the most
heavily used weedkillers in America, according to a study published
today in the journal Nature.</LD>
<LD>   Syngenta, the largest U.S. producer of atrazine, questioned the
finding. However, even if these effects are real, they have no
bearing on human health risks, said Tim Pastoor, a toxicologist based
in the company's Greensboro, N.C., offices.</LD>
<LD>   The study, the second this year by UC Berkeley endocrinologist
Tyrone B. Hayes to scrutinize the feminization of frogs by the farm
chemical, comes as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency nears the
end of an eight-year safety review of atrazine.</LD>
<TE>   The review was undertaken in 1994 after decades of heavy atrazine
use on corn and sorghum crops caused it to become the most commonly
detected pesticide in American ground- and surface water. It was even
routinely detected far from agricultural areas, in presumably
pristine sites such as national parks.</TE>
<TE>   The reason, said William A. Battaglin, a hydrologist with the U.S.
Geological Survey in Lakewood, Colo., is that atrazine is very
soluble: "It moves with rain, with air, on dust."</TE>
<TE>   Hayes was one of dozens of hormone specialists approached to study
the chemical for the EPA review. "My original thought was [that]
nothing was going to happen," Hayes said. But in April, he published
a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
showing that South African clawed frogs exposed to atrazine in the
laboratory suffered an array of sexual deformities. Hayes speculated
that the weedkiller was throwing a series of hormonal switches in the
frogs, which led to the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.</TE>
<TE>   Syngenta criticized the April study for using foreign animals in
artificial conditions. The Nature study looks at the most common U.S.
species, the leopard frog, at eight sites chosen in states in a
west-east slice from Utah to Iowa. "Now, we've shown it in the wild,
and only where there is atrazine," Hayes said.</TE>
<TE>   The finding revives arguments about atrazine in drinking water.
Since 1991, a number of European countries have banned or suspended
its use. A French ban is expected to take effect next year because
atrazine has exceeded the 1-part-per-billion level in drinking water
set for any pesticide. By contrast, the EPA set a maximum average
level for atrazine of 3 ppb in U.S. drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   Pastoor said the U.S. level was set after studying hundreds of
toxicity trials and allowing wide safety buffers: "At this rate, a
150-pound adult could drink 21,000 gallons of water a day for 70
years and still experience no adverse health effects."</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists remain concerned because frogs are regarded as
important markers of water purity.</TE>
<TE>   As global frog populations have crashed over the last 10 years,
researchers have focused on three potential causes: climate change,
urban development and pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   "From biblical times, people have relied on frogs as indicators of
water quality," said Battaglin of the Geological Survey. "If you read
records of early settlers in the Western U.S., if they got to a water
supply and it didn't have frogs in it, they wouldn't drink."</TE>
<TE>   In California, 55,000 pounds of atrazine are used every year,
mainly in agriculture. It may be one factor in the disappearance of
some of the state's most common frogs, said Carlos Davidson, an
ecologist at Cal State Sacramento. Once-common red-legged frogs have
disappeared from 70% of their former sites, and mountain
yellow-legged frogs from 90% of their territory.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson points to the pressure of urban development in basins and
on coasts, but he suspects that pesticide drift is behind the
disappearance of mountain frog populations. "Historic accounts of the
Sierra Nevada had people not being able to walk around lakes without
stepping on frogs," he said. "You go to these lakes now, and there
are no frogs."</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary EPA risk assessment for atrazine is expected in
January 2003.</TE>

<HD>Gov. Bush Is Urged to Seek Release of Haitians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A congresswoman pressed Gov. Jeb Bush on Wednesday to ask his brother
the president to order the release of more than 200 Haitian
immigrants detained in Florida after they jumped off a freighter and
waded ashore.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican governor was confronted during a campaign stop by
Rep Carrie P. Meek (D-Fla.), who said the Haitians should be treated
like Cuban immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   "All you have to do is call -- the wet foot-dry foot policy would
take effect," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Normally, Cuban immigrants are allowed to remain in the U.S. if
they reach land, while those intercepted at sea are returned.</TE>
<TE>   The governor said he agrees that the Haitians should be released
until their asylum requests have been heard, as with immigrants from
other countries. "Haitians should be treated in the same fashion that
Jamaicans, people from the Bahamas, people from any country in the
world," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, the governor said he had called White House
officials regarding the immigrants, but he did not elaborate
Wednesday or say whether he had spoken with his brother.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said that the Haitians were
being treated fairly and humanely and that the president would not
intervene.</TE>
<TE>   The 50-foot wooden freighter carrying 211 Haitians and three
Dominicans ran aground Tuesday near a causeway south of downtown
Miami. Six Haitian nationals were charged with illegal smuggling. On
Tuesday afternoon, authorities identified the Dominicans as being
Cubans who were picked up off a raft. No Cubans were aboard the
vessel.</TE>
<TE>   The Haitian immigrants consisted of 150 men, 35 women and 26
juveniles, INS spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez said. One of the minors
was hospitalized for dehydration. Gonzalez declined to say whether
any of the immigrants had asked for asylum.</TE>
<TE>   Bill McBride, the Democratic nominee for governor, released a
letter to President Bush asking him to order the Haitians' release.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Case Touched by Death Penalty Politics, Lawyers Say</HD>
<DH>Aides indicate Ashcroft will likely take it out of
Maryland, a move that is seen as unusual. There is no 'ultimate
sanction' for minors in that state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who remained distant from the investigation
of the sniper shootings during the rampage, seized control of the
prosecution this week, raising questions among some lawyers about
whether the politics of the death penalty had trumped the ordinary
rules for handling murder cases.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Montgomery County, Md., prosecutor Douglas F. Gansler
filed six counts of murder against John Allen Muhammad, 41, and Lee
Boyd Malvo, 17. He sought the death penalty against Muhammad, but
Maryland law does not allow capital punishment for those under age
18.</LD>
<LD>   "Montgomery County was the community most affected and most
impacted by the sniper shootings," Gansler said, because six of 10
slayings took place there.</LD>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, Ashcroft, having returned from a trip to Asia,
announced that federal prosecutors had filed separate charges in
Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, his office said it would decide where the case would be
prosecuted first, and liberal, Democratic-leaning Montgomery County
was not the likely venue, his aides said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why the Justice Department had intervened, Ashcroft
said, "It's important that we have available the very most serious
penalties in a setting like this. I believe that the ultimate
sanction ought to be available here."</TE>
<TE>   The public squabble over who would try the sniper suspects broke
out just hours after the pair were arrested -- in Maryland. Muhammad
and Boyd were being questioned at a county jail in Rockville, Md.,
when federal authorities insisted they be transferred to federal
custody in Baltimore. With the two in federal hands, the Justice
Department says it can take charge of the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Several former prosecutors and law professors called Ashcroft's
intervention heavy-handed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is normally the kind of case the feds would want to turn
over to the states, and Maryland has suffered the most," said Beth
Wilkinson, a former federal prosecutor who worked on the Oklahoma
City bombing case.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, U.S. authorities prosecuted Timothy J. McVeigh and
Terry L. Nichols because eight federal law enforcement officers were
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities also prosecuted Theodore Kaczynski, the
Unabomber, for his 17-year series of mail bombings. Legal experts
described that case as a classic federal crime -- sending bombs
across the country via the U.S. mail.</TE>
<TE>   The sniper shootings in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.,
resulted in 10 deaths, but murder, even crossing state lines to
commit murder, is not itself a federal crime.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's complaint, the Justice Department said it could
prosecute the sniper suspects under the Hobbs Act, a 1946 measure
intended as a weapon against Mafia bosses who used violence to
squeeze money out of legitimate businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "This is rather unusual use of the Hobbs Act," Wilkinson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like a bit of a stretch," agreed Kevin McNally, a
defense lawyer in Frankfort, Ky., who specializes in federal death
penalty cases.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department also said it might prosecute the pair under
federal firearms charges. Under this theory, Muhammad and Malvo could
be charged with transporting a regulated firearm across state lines
for the purpose of committing murder.</TE>
<TE>   But Ashcroft stressed he had not decided how the case would be
handled. Like Maryland law, federal law limits capital punishment to
those 18 or older.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, some officials favor sending the case to one of
the three Virginia counties where the sniper fired a lethal shot.
Virginia also has a newly enacted anti-terrorism law that would
simplify the prosecution of the pair.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew McBride, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, said
Virginia would give prosecutors the best chance for sending Muhammad
to his death if convicted and their only chance of winning a death
sentence against Malvo.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a shorter and more secure route to the death penalty in
Virginia," McBride said. "Under Virginia law, you don't have to prove
which one was the triggerman, and that's very useful to the
prosecutor. Of course, if I were a defense lawyer, I would want the
case to go to Maryland."</TE>
<TE>   During the Civil War, the Potomac River served as the dividing
line between the North and South, and even today, Virginia and
Maryland have rather different political cultures. Virginia is a
Republican stronghold, and Maryland leans just as strongly in favor
of Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Maryland are surprised at the sudden turn of events in a
case that had brought together the entire region.</TE>
<TE>   "After all, the hard work was done by Montgomery County and Chief
[Charles A.] Moose. They [Justice Department officials] stood back
and let this proceed as a local matter. Then, after the arrest, the
federal government steps in and takes charge," said University of
Maryland law professor Michael Greenberger, who served in the Clinton
administration. "Common sense would tell you that after what Maryland
went through, Maryland would have the strongest claim to prosecute.
But Virginia is more conservative and Republican, and I have the
sense Ashcroft may send the case there."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft has been a strong supporter of the death penalty and has
clashed with those who have a different view.</TE>
<TE>   As a senator from Missouri, Ashcroft persuaded his fellow
Republicans to vote as a bloc to defeat Missouri Supreme Court
Justice Ronnie White's nomination by President Clinton for a federal
judgeship. Ashcroft said the justice had voted to reverse some death
sentences. However, White had upheld the death penalty in most of the
cases that came before him.</TE>
<TE>   In the sniper case, officials in all the jurisdictions agree that
the death penalty is the appropriate punishment for the killer.</TE>
<TE>   They disagree only on which jurisdiction should seek it first.</TE>
<TE>   "Politics and division always seem to be involved when the death
penalty is on the table," said Richard Dieter, director of the Death
Penalty Information Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes for a very strange situation."</TE>

<HD>Mondale Accepts Call to Run</HD>
<DH>Minnesota Democratic party selects him to replace Wellstone
as its Senate candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon and Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Walter F. Mondale, whose crushing defeat in the 1984 presidential
campaign inspired a rebellion within the national Democratic Party
against traditional liberalism, was chosen unanimously Wednesday
night to replace the late Paul Wellstone as the party's Senate
nominee.</LD>
<LD>   Even before the meeting of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party began
in Minneapolis' Historic State Theatre, most of the delegates were
wearing new Mondale campaign buttons, including one that read "Let's
win one for Paul."</LD>
<LD>   In less than a minute, Mondale's nomination was ratified by a
rousing voice vote, and more than 1,000 party members chanted, "We
want Fritz! We want Fritz! We want Fritz!"</LD>
<TE>   A new poll gave Mondale a solid lead over his Republican opponent,
Norm Coleman. If elected, not only would the former vice president
retain a crucial seat for his party, but his return may stand as the
latest refutation of novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous
declaration, "There are no second acts in American lives."</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Mondale suffered the most lopsided Electoral College loss
of any presidential candidate: He won just his home state of
Minnesota and the District of Columbia, only 13 electoral votes in
all, compared with 525 for Ronald Reagan. Even George S. McGovern did
better against Richard Nixon in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   "The irony ... is that the Democratic Party has spent most of the
past 18 years trying to exorcise Walter Mondale," said Jack Pitney
Jr., a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. "When
Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton or Al Gore called themselves a
'different kind of Democrat,' they meant they were different from
Mondale. Now Democrats embrace him as passionately as they repudiated
him."</TE>
<TE>   Mondale's entry into the race came as Democrats were being
criticized for turning a Wellstone memorial service Tuesday night
into a political rally.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel used," said Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, an independent
who walked out of the service before it ended. "I think the Democrats
should be hanging their heads in shame."</TE>
<TE>   Critics complained that one speaker urged the crowd to work for a
Democratic victory on Tuesday. And Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) was booed.</TE>
<TE>   The state Republican Party later asked media outlets to offer
equal time to the GOP ticket. "I think the Democrats crossed the line
last night when their memorial service for Sen. Wellstone turned into
a get-out-the-vote rally," said Ron Eibensteiner, state party
chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone campaign manager Jeff Blodgett said he "deeply
regretted" if anyone was offended. "Some of these speakers were
Wellstone campaign workers caught up in the final days of a campaign
-- a tough campaign that we were going to win," he said. "Going on to
win this campaign is part of the grieving process for some of them."</TE>
<TE>   Mondale, a 74-year-old political legend, now faces a five-day dash
to the election.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight our campaign begins," he told the cheering crowd
Wednesday night. "I start with a pledge to you: I will be your voice,
and I will be Paul Wellstone's voice for decency and hope and better
lives."</TE>
<TE>   In his first day of campaigning today, Mondale is scheduled to
appear on two radio shows, hold a news conference and speak at a town
hall meeting at Macalester College in St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone, who died in a plane crash Friday, was locked in one of
several tight races that could determine whether Democrats remain in
control of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, a former mayor of St. Paul, was back on the stump early
Wednesday after suspending his campaign out of respect for Wellstone.
He acknowledged that running against Mondale would be a "daunting
task."</TE>
<TE>   "But we've been working close to two years here. We've laid out of
a vision, how to grow jobs, cut taxes, improve education," Coleman
said. "Nobody in Minnesota is handed anything. You work for it. So
we're going to do what we have been doing ... and that's simply get
out there and work." Coleman also began airing a new TV ad invoking
Wellstone's name.</TE>
<TE>   "All of Minnesota grieves," he says in the ad. But "now, I have to
ask you to look with me into the future" -- a subtle reference to the
expected criticism of Mondale as a representative of the politics of
the past.</TE>
<TE>   It would not be the first time that Mondale has been so
criticized. In the race for the 1984 Democratic nomination, then-Sen.
Gary Hart, Mondale's principal rival, ran on a platform of "new
ideas" and denounced Mondale as "a collection of special interests"
and a "spokesman from the past."</TE>
<TE>   Mondale's overwhelming loss in that election prompted the
formation of the Democratic Leadership Council, an influential
organization of party centrists who argued that Democrats could not
win back the White House unless they recaptured the center.
Eventually that effort flowered in the emergence of Bill Clinton and
his "New Democrat" philosophy in the 1992 presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   For many Democratic reformers, Mondale -- with his intimate ties
to labor unions and other traditional Democratic interest groups, his
skepticism of free trade, his identification with big-spending
Washington programs -- became a symbol of their efforts to liberate
the party.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Mondale's thinking was somewhat more nuanced: The central
plank of his 1984 general election campaign was a promise to reduce
the deficit that had exploded after Reagan's tax cuts. But in most
respects Mondale's 1984 campaign did represent the last hurrah for a
New Deal liberalism built on faith in a paternalistic federal
government; every Democratic nominee since has separated himself from
that tradition, promising an activist but fiscally responsible and
less bureaucratic government.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1984 campaign made it clear that the New Deal paradigm as a
formula for political success and governance was played out," said
Bill Galston, Mondale's issues director in that election and now a
professor of public affairs at the University of Maryland. "And every
presidential candidacy since has been conducted in one way or another
under the shadow of that recognition."</TE>
<TE>   While Mondale's return to the arena marks a remarkable personal
journey, in another sense it is not unique. Over the last generation,
three other defeated presidential candidates have returned to the
Senate. Barry Goldwater, repudiated in a landslide defeat as the GOP
presidential nominee in 1964, won election to the Senate four years
later; Hubert H. Humphrey won reelection to the Senate in 1970, two
years after Nixon narrowly beat him for the presidency; and McGovern
won reelection two years after his defeat in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   But none had such a long gap between their race for the White
House and their reentry into electoral politics. No defeated
presidential candidate has ever tried to return to the political
stage after a longer intermission between Act One and Act Two.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Mondale will be an elder statesman, but that can be a
significant role," said Galston. "If he wins, I wouldn't necessarily
expect him to run for reelection at the age of 80 [in 2008]. So this
is a prediction: He will feel freer than he ever has in his life ...
to vote his conscience without looking over his shoulder. I don't
expect him to be an entirely predictable voice."</TE>
<TE>   Mondale served as Clinton's ambassador to Japan from 1993 to 1996,
where he helped to negotiate trade agreements, a position that has
made him more of a supporter of such agreements than Wellstone. He is
a partner in the international and corporate practice group of Dorsey
&amp; Whitney, Minnesota's largest law firm, and has served on the boards
of BlackRock Funds, an investment management company; Northwest
Airlines and UnitedHealth Group.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale, a former state attorney general who was twice elected to
the Senate, has remained popular in Minnesota, say political
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1984 loss tarnished his image, but he remained a son of
Minnesota," said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington
University in St. Louis. "Since that time, Mondale's stature among
Minnesotans has steadily risen. While ambassador to Japan, he would
return to Minnesota from time to time to give a speech or make a
media appearance. Each time he was treated as the embodiment of the
Humphrey tradition, as a symbol of Minnesota's place in national and
world affairs, and as a model public servant."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Hofrenning, chairman of the political science department at
St. Olaf College in Minnesota, said Coleman's major criticism of
Wellstone was his political leanings made him an outsider in the
Senate, so he couldn't get things done. "Since Mondale was a leader
and Senate insider, that argument won't work anymore," Hofrenning
said.</TE>
<TE>   Arne Carlson, a former Republican governor, told the Fox TV
station here that Mondale would need to come across as "both wise and
energetic."</TE>
<TE>   At Wellstone campaign headquarters, where a block-long fence is
covered with flowers, handwritten personal recollections, union hats
and signs like one reading "Liberal and Proud," supporters of the
late senator welcomed Mondale's entry.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Spencer said that Wellstone would have approved of Mondale's
selection . "He's just the only choice we could have had," she said.
She said she expects Republicans to raise Mondale's age as an issue.</TE>
<TE>   And if that issue does come up, it would be quite an irony.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1984 presidential campaign, Reagan, then 73, was asked
in a debate whether his advancing age was a cause for concern. He
answered, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not
going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and
inexperience." The opponent: Mondale.</TE>

<CX>   Electoral College -- In a Section A story Thursday, The Times
erroneously reported that Democrat Walter F. Mondale suffered the
most lopsided Electoral College defeat of any presidential candidate.
The most lopsided outcome occurred in 1936, when President Franklin
D. Roosevelt defeated Republican Alfred M. Landon, 523 to 8. In the
1984 presidential contest, President Reagan defeated Mondale, 525 to
13.</CX>

<HD>Democrats, GOP Set a Record for Fund-Raising: $800 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Fineman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Republican and Democratic national committees together have
raised more than $800 million in the run-up to next week's midterm
congressional elections -- a record amount for a nonpresidential
election year, according to documents tallied and released by the
Federal Election Commission on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   As in past years, the Republican National Committee has raised
more money than the Democrats in the two contribution categories.
These are "hard money" -- donations that are limited by federal law
-- and "soft money" -- the unlimited contributions from unions,
corporations and wealthy individuals that will be banned after the
Tuesday elections.</LD>
<LD>   The FEC documents, which track contributions from Jan. 1, 2001,
through Oct. 16, show that the Republicans raised a total of $289
million in hard money -- more than twice the $127.4 million in these
funds contributed to the Democrats. The Republicans also led in
soft-money receipts: $221.7 million, compared with $199.6 million for
the Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   The soft-money tallies set a record, exceeding even the totals for
the 2000 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Those contributions to national political parties will be illegal
after next week's elections under the campaign reform measure that
President Bush signed into law earlier this year.</TE>

<HD>Member of Pioneer Rap Group Run DMC Is Slain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Jam Master Jay, part of the pioneering rap trio Run DMC, was shot and
killed Wednesday, the group's publicist said.</LD>
<LD>   Publicist Tracy Miller confirmed the death of the 37-year-old disc
jockey, whose real name was Jason Mizell.</LD>
<LD>   He was shot once in the head and was dead at the scene, said
police Det. Robert Price. He said the shooter remained at large and
police had no information on a motive.</LD>
<TE>   A second man, identified by police as 25-year-old Urieco Rincon,
was shot in the leg and was taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital. The
hospital did not immediately return a call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Run DMC is widely credited with helping bring hip-hop into music's
mainstream, including the group's smash collaboration with Aerosmith
on the 1980s standard "Walk This Way."</TE>
<TE>   "We always knew rap was for everyone," Mizell said in a 2001
interview with MTV. "Anyone could rap over all kinds of music."</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't the soulful R&amp;B of the '70s and '80s," he said of the
group's early work. "So we didn't want to be like the soft R&amp;B. We
wanted to go hard-core, so we put the rock 'n' roll on our rap."</TE>
<TE>   Mizell served as the group's disc jockey, providing background for
singers Joseph Simmons, better known as DJ Run, and Darryl McDaniels,
better known as DMC.</TE>
<TE>   Mizell was married and had three children, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great producer, a hard worker," he said. "He's a family
man."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of fans gathered on the outskirts of the crime scene in
Queens, where the members of Run DMC grew up.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the best. They're the pioneers in hip-hop," said fan
Arlene Clark, 39.</TE>
<TE>   Another fan who lives nearby, Leslie Bell, 33, said Run DMC often
let local musicians record for free at their studio.</TE>
<TE>   "That was their decision, to stay here and give back to the
community," Bell said. "He is one great man. The good always die
young. He's the good guy."</TE>
<TE>   The trio released a greatest-hits album earlier this year. In
2001, the rappers produced "Crown Royal," breaking an eight-year
silence.</TE>

<HD>Even if Democrats Win, Tax Cut Stays</HD>
<DH>Candidates with a chance to capture Senate seats have said
they back Bush plan. The party's leaders say it has caused deficit.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Prospects are dimming that Democrats can challenge President Bush's
tax cut, the centerpiece of his economic agenda, even if they
maintain or enlarge their Senate majority.</LD>
<LD>   That's because almost all of the Democratic challengers with a
plausible chance of capturing Republican Senate seats in Tuesday's
election have embraced the tax cut -- to the point where several are
running ads touting their support for it.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, national party leaders such as Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) have blamed the 10-year, $1.35-trillion
tax cut enacted in mid-2001 for the return of the federal budget
deficit after years of surplus. They also have linked it to the
sluggish economy.</LD>
<TE>   But the stampede toward the tax cut by key Democratic candidates
means that the party has almost no chance of amassing enough votes to
roll it back in the Senate next year, no matter the result on
election day.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, leading Democrats, like Daschle, are growing resigned to
the likelihood that not only will the tax cut stand, but also the
next cuts in income tax rates scheduled for 2004 will go into effect,
even though the federal budget ended last year with a $160-billion
deficit. "I couldn't right now see a challenge on the rates," Daschle
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, the refusal by many Democrats to challenge
the tax cut has made it tougher for Republicans to paint them as
traditional tax-and-spend liberals. But analysts in both parties say
it has also made it harder for Democrats to articulate a clear
alternative to Bush's economic plan.</TE>
<TE>   And that appears to be making it tougher for Democratic candidates
to benefit from voter unhappiness with the economy; recent polls show
the two parties essentially tied when voters are asked which could
better produce prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason [Republicans] are tied with Democrats on the economy
is they haven't offered a critique on what exactly President Bush did
that hurt the economy," said Republican pollster Bill McIntuff.</TE>
<TE>   That view is privately echoed by some leading Democratic
strategists.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Daschle, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad
of South Dakota and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
Missouri have placed primary blame on the tax cut for virtually
erasing the $5.6-trillion, 10-year budget surplus projected when Bush
took office.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, after going from record surpluses to real deficits, we're
seeing just how bad a decision that [tax cut] was," Daschle said in a
recent speech.</TE>
<TE>   In competitive Senate races, the tone is entirely different. In
New Hampshire, Democratic nominee Jeanne Shaheen has run an ad
declaring that she and GOP rival John Sununu "agree on the Bush tax
cut." In Texas, Democratic nominee Ron Kirk has been on the air
saying, "I support the president's effort to lower taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Other top Democratic Senate challengers who have endorsed the tax
cut include Mark Pryor in Arkansas, Tom Strickland in Colorado, Alex
Sanders in South Carolina and Bob Clement in Tennessee, who voted for
it in the House. "I'm for keeping the tax cuts and for making them
permanent," Clement said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Of the leading Democratic challengers, only North Carolina's
Erskine Bowles, the former Clinton White House chief of staff locked
in a close race against Republican Elizabeth Hanford Dole, has
dissented. Bowles says he would freeze further tax cuts for the top
1% of earners to pay for a prescription drug plan under Medicare,
though that would likely cover only a small portion of the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Political geography may help explain the positions taken by these
Democrats. All seven are running in states Bush carried in 2000 and
for Senate seats now held by Republicans. Apart from opposing Bush's
call for creating private investment accounts under Social Security,
all have sought to minimize conflict with the White House; all, for
instance, supported the congressional resolution authorizing Bush to
use force against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Except for Iowa's Tom Harkin and the late Paul Wellstone in
Minnesota, all of the Democratic incumbents in competitive races
voted for the tax cut and have continued to praise it. That list
includes Max Cleland in Georgia, Tim Johnson in South Dakota, Mary
Landrieu in Louisiana and Jean Carnahan in Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic candidates do quibble on further steps in the Bush
tax agenda. Most oppose Republican proposals to completely eliminate
the estate tax, claiming that would overly benefit the rich; instead,
they generally prefer a competing Democratic proposal to exempt
roughly the first $5 million in estates from taxation.</TE>
<TE>   And not all the Democratic challengers have endorsed GOP calls to
make the full tax cut permanent.</TE>
<TE>   But on the most imminent choice facing Washington in the year
ahead, Bush appears to have won the argument before a new Congress
even convenes. In January 2004, income tax rates in the four highest
brackets are each scheduled to be cut by one percentage point, with
another cut due in January 2006. Analysts have estimated that those
cuts will reduce federal revenue by about $30 billion to $45 billion
a year when the government is projecting continuing deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats always faced an uphill climb in challenging these
reductions because 12 Democratic senators voted for the tax cut bill
and have been reluctant to revisit their votes. Initially, Democrats
critical of the tax cut hoped that party gains in this year's
election might pressure some of their colleagues to reconsider,
especially if the results were interpreted as a repudiation of Bush's
economic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Some activists in both parties believe these Democrats may try to
find escape clauses that would allow them to support retrenchment of
the tax cut. But both Daschle and some senior White House officials
believe the candidates have been so emphatic that they have little
room to reverse course.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they have left themselves any wiggle room," said
one senior White House official.</TE>

<HD>Pentagon to Begin Training Journalists for Battlefield</HD>
<DH>It's the latest indication that war with Iraq is getting
closer. Course will include instruction on protection against
chemical weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the latest signal that war with Iraq may be looming, the Pentagon
said Wednesday that it will begin offering special
training--including instruction on chemical weapons protection--to
journalists who cover the military.</LD>
<LD>   "While no decisions have been made about future operations,"
Pentagon officials said in a memo to news organizations, "prudent
planning demands that we prepare for embedding media with military
units."</LD>
<LD>   The weeklong training courses are scheduled to start as early as
mid-November, at bases in Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia and at an
undisclosed location abroad. Pentagon officials said they expect
hundreds of U.S. and foreign journalists to take part in the program,
described as the first of its kind.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said the training sessions are not mandatory, and were
put together in response to recent inquiries from news organizations
about media access in the event of a war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The memo, issued by Defense Department spokeswoman Victoria
Clarke, said the Pentagon is "absolutely committed to ensuring
reporters have maximum access to our troops on the battlefield."</TE>
<TE>   Access has long been a source of friction between the press and
the Pentagon, particularly in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when the
United States expelled Iraq from Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Correspondents covering that war complained that they faced
unprecedented restrictions on where they could travel and what they
were allowed to report.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said many in the media were woefully uneducated
about military matters and ill-equipped to cover or take part in
"embedments," in which reporters accompany military units on
missions.</TE>
<TE>   There was also significant tension between reporters and the
military early in the war in Afghanistan. In one incident, a
Washington Post reporter attempting to examine the site of an allied
bombing said he was barred from the scene by U.S. soldiers
brandishing weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq poses particular concerns for correspondents because of the
threat of biological and chemical weapons. A recent CIA report warned
of a "high" probability that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein would
unleash such weapons if the U.S. invades.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the Pentagon said it would provide training and
information about equipment to protect against chemical and
biological weapons. The sessions will also offer basic survival and
first-aid training, as well as instruction on major weapons systems
and military procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke's memo also warned would-be war correspondents to be in
shape. "This training will be physically challenging and will include
road marches and some fitness training," it said.</TE>

<HD>Costly House Race Set in Land of Poverty</HD>
<DH>Candidates' spending in West Virginia may be a record. Bush
plans a campaign stop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Fineman and Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Jim Humphreys' dad was a garbage man. Today, Humphreys is a
multimillionaire -- as well as a fiercely liberal Democratic trial
lawyer trying to win a U.S. House seat in West Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Shelley Moore Capito's dad was a beloved former congressman,
three-term governor and a crook, who served three years in federal
prison for corruption after he left the governor's mansion.</LD>
<LD>   Now Humphreys and Capito, a housewife who two years ago became
West Virginia's first Republican in Congress in almost two decades,
stand on the brink of history.</LD>
<TE>   Taken together, they have run what may end up as the most
expensive U.S. House campaign in history -- in one of the nation's
poorest states.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Federal Election Commission records show that the race to
control this sleepy and diverse district of coal miners, farmers and
Washington-area commuters is this year's costliest House race: almost
$9 million spent since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   And by the time the final tallies are in for a race that also will
help determine which party controls the House, the contest's bottom
line is likely to exceed the record $11 million spent in a San
Gabriel Valley-based district in 2000, when Democrat Adam B. Schiff
of Pasadena defeated then-incumbent Rep. James E. Rogan, a
Republican.</TE>
<TE>   These figures only account for the money raised directly by the
candidates. It does not include additional money spent by national
parties and special interests on their behalf. Nationally, the two
parties have raised more than $800 million, a record amount for a
non-presidential election year.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the importance of the West Virginia race, President
Bush is to make a campaign stop today at the Charleston Civic Center
in the heart of the district in hope of providing Capito an
eleventh-hour boost.</TE>
<TE>   It will be Bush's second trip in four months to a geographically
broad, mostly impoverished and largely ignored sliver of West
Virginia. Vice President Dick Cheney, his wife, Lynne, and three
Cabinet secretaries also have stumped for Capito during the last six
months.</TE>
<TE>   For many analysts, the lavish political spending in so poor a
place defines the high stakes in Tuesday's vote. For others, it
spotlights the need for the new campaign finance laws that will kick
in the morning after the polls close.</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia ranks second in the nation in the percentage of
people living in poverty; it tops the list of states where children
live below the poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an anomaly to have that much money spent in West Virginia,"
said Allan S. Hammock, who teaches political science at West Virginia
University. "But the stakes are high."</TE>
<TE>   Added Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political analyst:
"This district is a microcosm of the high spending taking place in
the relative handful of truly competitive districts across the
country this year."</TE>
<TE>   So far, most pundits give Capito, 49, a slight edge.</TE>
<TE>   This year's race is a rematch from 2000, when Capito edged
Humphreys. That election also ranked among the most expensive House
races, with spending by the two candidates totaling $8.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, Humphreys' deep pockets were the key to setting it
apart.</TE>
<TE>   Humphreys, 53, amassed a personal fortune by winning huge
compensation claims for victims of asbestos poisoning. FEC records
show he spent $6.9 million of his own money on the last election.</TE>
<TE>   Already, he has spent nearly $6 million more on this election,
more than $2 million of it on advertising.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Capito's FEC filings show she has spent a total of $2
million, most of it raised through so-called "hard money" --
regulated contributions from individuals and political action
committees.</TE>
<TE>   But Capito has been the beneficiary of millions more dollars in
"soft money," largely unregulated contributions that corporations,
unions and individuals can make to political parties and special
interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   Such soft money will be illegal after next week's elections under
the campaign reform act that Bush signed into law earlier this year.
Capito voted in favor of the measure.</TE>
<TE>   In the final soft-money blitz, though, the National Republican
Congressional Committee alone has ponied up more than $2 million for
pro-Capito television and radio spots.</TE>
<TE>   NRCC officials say their spending is an attempt to offset the
ubiquitous Humphreys, who has used his wealth to crisscross the
district on chartered executive jets and saturate the state's
television and radio airwaves with more than $2 million in
commercials in the last three months alone.</TE>
<TE>   To reach a rich voter reservoir in the state's eastern panhandle,
where the last election was decided, Humphreys' ads are even running
in the costly Washington market. One of Humphreys' ad executives
conceded: "There are people across the Maryland suburbs who are
saying, 'Who the hell is Jim Humphreys, and why should I care?' "</TE>
<TE>   On balance, concluded one Republican operative, "the people of
West Virginia are just numb" from an onslaught of political ads that
generally have been as ill-mannered as they have been well-funded.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is fed up with the negative campaigning by both sides,"
agreed Mike Agee, chairman of the West Virginia Manufacturers Assn.
"Too much money is being spent on downgrading one's opponent."</TE>
<TE>   Each side blames the other for the negativity and the escalating
spending.</TE>
<TE>   NRCC Communications Director Steve Schmidt said his group's
efforts for Capito are needed to counter Humphreys' spending levels,
which he labeled "obscene."</TE>
<TE>   "Jim Humphreys," Schmidt added, "is living proof of the old adage
that it's easy to separate a fool from his money."</TE>
<TE>   Humphreys' strategists counter that the NRCC's spending on the
race is pushing Humphreys to write more checks to his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We just keep raising the stakes on each other," said Jason
Ralston, senior vice president of GMMB, the Washington-based
Democratic strategic communications company that is handling
Humphreys' advertising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Almost lost amid the daily charges and countercharges over
spending are the issues. Humphreys has pledged to protect Social
Security, bring down the soaring price of prescription drugs and
target corporate corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Capito has defended her record as a moderate Republican and
attacked Humphreys for supporting laws that have raised taxes on
Social Security benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, most analysts say the outcome could well come down to
something as simple as the two candidates' affability ratings among
West Virginians.</TE>
<TE>   Most also agreed, though, that the outcome is likely to be an
accurate barometer of the nation's mood.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is that [Capito] wins unless there is a fairly strong
national trend to the Democrats," said Neil Berch, a West Virginia
University political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   "If Humphreys wins, I think the Democrats regain the House."</TE>

<LD>   Connecting the Bali nightclub massacre to an attack on American
troops in Kuwait and the bombing of a French oil tanker off Yemen,
Bush said earlier this month that "it is going to take a while to
fully rout Al Qaeda. We just learned a lesson.... It's going to take
a while to succeed."</LD>
<LD>   In recent testimony before a congressional panel, CIA Director
George J. Tenet emphasized that Al Qaeda was still capable of
planning and carrying out attacks in multiple theaters of operation.</LD>
<TE>   Al Qaeda's senior leaders, though weakened and on the run,
survived the first phase of the war in Afghanistan. They have
succeeded not only in motivating hardened foot soldiers but in
inspiring sympathizers to launch independent terror attacks, sowing
fear and inflicting economic damage. Al Qaeda's strategy seems to aim
at affirming its existence and defying the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a recent audiotape by Osama Bin Laden's closest
lieutenant, Ayman Zawahiri, assumed responsibility for suicide
bombings against French engineers in Pakistan and German tourists in
Tunisia. While Zawahiri also praised "holy warriors" for the attack
on the French oil tanker and gun battles with U.S. Marines in Kuwait,
he did not accept direct responsibility in Al Qaeda's name.</TE>
<TE>   This post-9/11 campaign relies on small-scale, decentralized
operations and aims mainly at "soft" nonmilitary targets. Deadly and
effective, these operations are easier to plan and carry out than
were the complex, spectacular World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks
and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa. They also do
not require as much supervision by Al Qaeda's surviving leadership
and depend largely on the initiative of loyalists.</TE>
<TE>   Young men who are unconnected to Al Qaeda but outraged by U.S.
policies toward the Palestinians or Iraq can apparently be nudged by
the inflammatory rhetoric of Al Qaeda leaders to pursue freelance
terrorism and kill Westerners on their own, complicating and
prolonging the U.S. war on terror. The assassination of a senior
American diplomat in Jordan appears to fall into this freelance
category.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. must take seriously the rage against U.S. foreign
policies in the world of Islam. The festering Palestinian wound fuels
anti-Americanism, as does the U.S. stand toward Iraq even as
Washington maintains cozy relations with more pliant dictators. A
U.S. invasion of Iraq, with large civilian casualties, would only
make these young Muslims more inclined to join jihadi cells of the Al
Qaeda variety.</TE>
<TE>   Although most Arabs do not care for Saddam Hussein, neither do
they buy the administration's attempt to link him with Al Qaeda. They
know full well his brutal suppression of Muslim activists and the
loathing that Bin Laden has for his secularism.</TE>
<TE>   The dominant Arab-Muslim narrative stresses that an attack on Iraq
would be designed to settle old scores and make Washington the
arbiter of Arab destiny and resources, particularly oil. "This is a
war against Islam and Muslims, not against terrorism," is the common
complaint. U.S. unilateralism and insensitivity to Muslim concerns
threaten to turn Bin Laden, alive or dead, into a martyr and rallying
point for the dissatisfied.</TE>
<TE>   Initially after 9/11, Bin Laden's politics of despair and suicide
were discredited in Muslim eyes, thanks mainly to the
administration's coalition-building and limited goals. Arrests of key
Al Qaeda lieutenants in Pakistan, Morocco, Yemen, East Asia and
Europe and the freezing of financial assets took their toll on the
network. The most effective means of putting Al Qaeda out of business
is to work more closely with European and Muslim allies to tackle the
political and social roots of extremism.</TE>
<TE>   To reach the large "floating middle" of Muslim society, the U.S.
should pay more than lip service to the urgent tasks of peaceful
resolution of international conflicts, to sustainable development and
to a consistent, persuasive approach to human rights and liberty for
all.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This is homeland security?</LD>
<LD>   Two hundred Haitians sail into Miami. They swim ashore, clamber
onto a highway, surround cars and bring traffic to a standstill.
Then, and only then, do authorities seize them.</LD>
<LD>   Did our homeland securitizers know that the Haitian boat contained
no terrorists? No anthrax? No A-bomb? Or did they figure they'd let
the boat come ashore and see who, or what, spilled out?</LD>
<TE>   For its part, the Coast Guard considers Tuesday's operation a
success. On Wednesday, Lt. Jeffrey Smith, chief of the Coast Guard's
Miami station, appeared on Fox News and declared: "These people were
interdicted. This is something that worked out well."</TE>
<TE>   If "worked out well" means no loss of life, he has a point. But if
the question is whether Americans feel safe in their own country,
free from the fear that people from another country will jump onto
the hoods of their cars, maybe this thing didn't work out so well.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, if this incident amounts to sending a signal to
terrorists that the USA is still wide open, the ultimate effect of
the Miami fiasco could work out badly indeed.</TE>
<TE>   But don't be too hard on Smith; he's just reflecting the Coast
Guard's official line. As of Wednesday afternoon, the agency's Web
site offered no reaction to the Miami incident, but it did feature a
photograph of a Guardwoman consoling a child under the headline,
"Saving Migrants: We Do That, Every Day."</TE>
<TE>   Note the endlessly evolving political correctness: People who come
ashore, uninvited, are no longer "illegal aliens" or even
"undocumented immigrants." They're now simply "migrants."</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard is hardly alone in its
international-social-working approach, an approach that puts the
well-being of foreigners ahead of the safety of the citizenry.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the case of Lee Boyd Malvo, the Jamaican teenager accused
in the Beltway sniper case, which left 10 Americans dead. Columnist
Michelle Malkin reports that on Dec. 19 he was taken into custody in
Washington state by the Border Patrol, the uniformed law enforcement
arm of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Malvo admitted to
investigators that he was a stowaway. According to the rules, that
admission alone should have led to his immediate deportation. But in
January the INS ordered him released; nine months later, he was
arrested in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not just "migrants" who are getting a pass. What of the
other suspect in the sniper case, John Muhammad? The Bellingham,
Wash., Herald reports that the minister who operated a homeless
shelter where Muhammad stayed grew suspicious of his guest's
pro-terrorist comments and shared his concerns with the FBI. Yet even
after that report, Muhammad's four brushes with traffic authorities
failed to trigger alarms at the FBI's National Crime Information
Center, which is supposed to connect the dots of suspicious behavior.
Indeed, it's possible that he and Malvo would still be on the loose
if one of them hadn't allegedly called the police and volunteered a
connection to a 2001 robbery-murder in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   What do the Coast Guard, INS and FBI have in common, other than
leniency and Keystone Koppery? They're all federal agencies. The
Coast Guard is a part of the Department of Transportation, while the
INS and FBI are parts of the Justice Department. And if that's the
quality of federal response to seemingly random acts of lawbreaking,
what's the state of readiness in regard to some terrorist conspiracy?</TE>
<TE>   Not very good, according to a recent report by former Sens. Gary
Hart and Warren Rudman. The United States remains "dangerously
unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack
on U.S. soil," they declared.</TE>
<TE>   These men are worth heeding: In February 2001 they co-authored a
report on the danger of terrorism aimed directly at the United
States. To counter that threat, they proposed -- seven months before
9/11 -- the incorporation of the Coast Guard and the Border Patrol
into a new, no-nonsense Cabinet-rank homeland security agency.</TE>
<TE>   Today, of course, President Bush and Congress are still haggling
over the creation of a homeland security department.</TE>
<TE>   OK, little happens quickly in Washington. But before we even
consider invading another country -- they might have snipers in
Baghdad too -- we should make sure that our own homeland security
system is functional.</TE>

<HD>Greatest Risk of Smallpox Is Fear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marc Siegel</AU>
<BD>Marc Siegel is an assistant professor of medicine at
NYU and author of "Bellevue" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1998).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in 1797, when Edward Jenner first injected cowpox into a human,
he surely never dreamt his work would lead to a vaccination
controversy more than 200 years later.</LD>
<LD>   Yet we are now faced with a medical dilemma: With two vaccines
made from inactivated smallpox-related virus on the horizon -- one of
which is now undergoing clinical trials at the National Institutes of
Health -- should we use the outdated and more dangerous live-virus
vaccine in the meantime? And if so, who should receive it?</LD>
<LD>   The risk of smallpox appearing in the United States is still
theoretical. But ever since Ken Alibek, the former deputy director of
Biopreparat, the Soviet biological weapons apparatus, freely admitted
to extensive amounts of smallpox existing in the Soviet Union, there
is every reason to believe that some of the stockpiled virus may have
found its way into the hands of rogue dictators or terrorists. And
smallpox may be aerosolized -- if it is sprayed, it could infect
hundreds of victims right off the bat.</LD>
<TE>   Still, U.S. public health measures can be relied upon to contain
any smallpox outbreak that occurs. All contacts will need to be
inoculated, and afflicted patients will be isolated.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox spreads only when a person is already sick with a fever
or rash, so in fact it is harder to spread than more innocent-seeming
killers like the flu or measles.</TE>
<TE>   Further, there is reason to believe that everyone vaccinated
before 1972 still has some immunity and wouldn't get as sick from
smallpox. This "herd immunity" would also slow the spread in the
event of an attack.</TE>
<TE>   The fear associated with smallpox is much more contagious than the
disease. Smallpox is one of our ancient scourges, and it captures the
dark side of our imaginations. Schoolchildren learn of smallpox as
the first bioweapon, distributed in blankets to Native American
tribes by British troops during the French and Indian wars of the
1750s. Vague memories of our earliest immunizations against smallpox
haunt many of us.</TE>
<TE>   Yet smallpox never wiped out large populations the way influenza
and polio did. The greatest risk was always from secondary spread,
which existing public health measures may contain. The vaccination
program of the 1960s was undertaken largely to eradicate the disease
worldwide and not because there was a looming risk to a particular
group.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, as the risk of war -- and its associated risk of
bioweaponry -- increases, it is becoming more reasonable to vaccinate
health-care workers and emergency responders. Yet for the protection
of the public at large, the push must be to complete the research
underway on a safer vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   The old vaccine causes more than 1,000 serious complications per
million vaccinated, including brain swelling and unintended viral
contagion. This antiquated vaccine is not safe when given to people
who have certain skin conditions, are immuno-compromised or pregnant.
Unfortunately, these conditions may be hidden. The one recent death
from the smallpox vaccine occurred in a military recruit who
unknowingly was HIV-positive.</TE>
<TE>   Vaccination may be useful to treat fear, but not when there are
such side affects. It is reasonable to accumulate ready supplies of
this older vaccine in case an attack of smallpox occurs, but it is
not reasonable to use these supplies on the public now.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine shows
effectiveness of the old vaccine at 1/10 dilution, a dose that also
may dilute the risk. But diluting this dinosaur is not enough.
Instead, we must treat our fear with plenty of reason and restraint.
Our scientists must be allowed to complete their work on a more
modern, safer vaccine, the likes of which are already used for polio,
flu, measles and chickenpox.</TE>
<TE>   In a worst-case scenario, public health experts will still have
plenty of time to react to smallpox if this old enemy is deployed in
an attack against us.</TE>

<BD>Norah Vincent is a writer and a senior fellow at the
Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after
Sept. 11 to study terrorism. Web site: www.norahvincent.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dethroning a poet laureate is a sticky proposition. For starters,
it's embarrassing, not to mention possibly fraught with free-speech
complications. It's not something you do lightly, which is why it's
curious that both California and New Jersey have found themselves in
the unenviable position recently of impugning their chief bards.</LD>
<LD>   After having been tapped for the eminent literary post by Gov.
Gray Davis, California's poet laureate, Quincy T. Troupe, abruptly
resigned earlier this month when it was revealed that he had
embellished his resume.</LD>
<LD>   Troupe had claimed to have earned an undergraduate degree from
Grambling University, but it turns out that he merely attended
classes there and did not graduate.</LD>
<TE>   Because Troupe had the good grace, or perhaps shrewd instinct, to
step down when this documented mendacity came to light, California
has gotten off relatively easy on this one. Free speech didn't come
into it. If Troupe had been recalcitrant, the state would have been
as justified in firing him as any other employer who had found that
an employee lied on his resume. UC San Diego, where the poet teaches,
has an even stronger case for terminating him. After all, Troupe can
hardly be qualified to teach undergraduates when he has not himself
completed an undergraduate degree.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, with both employers, Troupe committed a terminal offense;
on the state level, he rightly paid the price for it.</TE>
<TE>   But what about New Jersey's poet laureate, Amiri Baraka? He too is
in trouble, but what to do about it has become a matter of heated
debate.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy began last month when Baraka read aloud a poem
titled "Somebody Blew Up America," which contains the following
verse: "Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed / Who
told 4,000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers / To stay home that day
/ Why did Sharon stay away?"</TE>
<TE>   An obvious reference to the widely discredited canard that the
government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had advance
knowledge of and was probably responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks,
Baraka's verse set off an understandable firestorm of protest,
including accusations of anti-Semitism from the Anti-Defamation
League.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey asked for Baraka's resignation,
but Baraka refused and has vowed to fight any effort to remove him.
Resolving this case may be a protracted and ugly process, which, as
any free-speech maven worth his salt will tell you, is as it should
be.</TE>
<TE>   McGreevey was right to upbraid Baraka for disseminating the most
loathsome bit of anti-Semitic conspiracy theory to surface since the
fraudulent "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion." But he was wrong to
try to strip Baraka of his post.</TE>
<TE>   Poets, unlike journalists and historians and a whole host of other
professionals, are not bound in their work by facts. By rights,
poems, unlike newspaper and magazine articles, advertisements and
nonfiction books, can take liberties with the truth. They are not
thereby rendered illegitimate as works of art, and their creators are
not thereby rendered unemployable.</TE>
<TE>   By lying on his resume, Troupe violated a code of ethics, and the
state of California would have been right to dismiss him for doing
so.</TE>
<TE>   By lying in verse, however, Baraka violated nothing except the
rules of common decency, which have no rightful bearing on artistic
expression.</TE>
<TE>   New Jerseyans are entitled to pillory Baraka for his hateful
views, but defenestrating a poet laureate over an offending verse
would set a dangerous and illiberal precedent for the policing of
public art.</TE>

<LD>Getting voters to the polls Tuesday will be like hauling them to the
dentist. The gubernatorial race is a hold-your-nose choice between
Gov. Gray Davis and GOP challenger Bill Simon Jr. Even those who plan
to vote aren't happy about their choices, according to a Los Angeles
Times poll published this week.</LD>
<LD>   Millions more registered voters are expected to not bother to
vote. But they should at least think of the big issues at stake in
this election. What they don't do could affect them for years to
come.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the $13-billion state bond issue for building new
schools, or the splitting of Los Angeles, or whether there will be an
emergency room available if that nonvoter has a heart attack or is
hurt in an auto accident.</LD>
<TE>   The voter who stays home may say it doesn't make any difference.
But it does. Someone will be elected governor -- either Davis or
Simon -- and he will shape the fiscal future of California, deciding
whether there should be higher taxes or massive cuts in state
services. Voters also will fill six other state offices that play
important roles in the lives of Californians.</TE>
<TE>   The lieutenant governor could wind up running the state if the
governor's office becomes vacant. The controller is a fiscal watchdog
who also serves on scores of boards and commissions such as the
California State Lands Commission, which can have a big effect on the
environment. The treasurer helps decide where the huge state
retirement systems will invest the billions that fund the pensions of
hundreds of thousands of teachers and state and local workers.</TE>
<TE>   Will the nonvoter's auto insurance cost more or less? The
insurance commissioner will decide. And, as we have learned -- the
hard way -- the commissioner can cozy up to insurance firms at the
expense of policyholders.</TE>
<TE>   By failing to vote for the school bonds in Proposition 47, the
stay-at-homers may be dooming more than 1 million schoolchildren to
crowded, deteriorating classrooms or flimsy temporary buildings. A
good education begins with a decent teaching environment.</TE>
<TE>   The state Board of Equalization decides which items are subject to
the sales tax. Its four members will be elected.</TE>
<TE>   It's understandable that voters are discouraged and even disgusted
by the nature of modern election campaigns. But the nasty ads don't
necessarily reflect the ability of the candidates to do the job.
Someone's going to be elected. It might as well be one who best
represents your interests.</TE>

<LD>When India and Pakistan -- neighbors that have fought three wars --
massed a million troops along their border last winter, U.S. and
European diplomats quickly urged restraint. Now both of the
nuclear-armed countries have announced plans to withdraw many
soldiers. The troop pullbacks can provide an opportunity for
continuing diplomacy in a calmer atmosphere.</LD>
<LD>   The main issue is Kashmir, the beautiful Himalayan territory that
both countries claim. Indian-held Kashmir conducted state elections
in September and this month, with a turnout of slightly more than
40%. That figure may not sound very high, but it took great courage
to defy terrorists threatening voters and candidates. Pro-Pakistani
militants killed scores of people in an attempt to scare Kashmiris
away from the ballot box. It didn't work.</LD>
<LD>   Although the balloting did not produce a clear winner, it did oust
incompetent state rulers who were pawns of India's federal
government. When a new state government is formed Saturday, India
should discuss providing more economic help, possibly more autonomy
and less brutal treatment of residents by Indian security forces. The
elections have not stopped daily firefights between militants and
security forces, but meaningful talks with Kashmiris about plans to
improve their lives could rob terrorists of support.</LD>
<TE>   Pakistan's elections produced a much less welcome result. Islamic
parties, which never did well in more than half a century of
independence, formed an alliance and managed big gains this time. The
coalition won control of two of four provinces and more seats in
Parliament than any other party. The victories were due in part to
dislike of the United States for ousting the Taliban in next-door
Afghanistan. But they were due in greater part to a vacuum caused by
the military government's rules curbing secular political parties
that were the most prominent critics of Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   Indian-held Kashmir has confronted a Pakistan-backed insurgency
for more than a decade. Pakistan has aided terrorists crossing into
Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state in largely Hindu India. After
attacks in Kashmir and New Delhi last year, India began its troop
buildup along the border and Pakistan responded in kind. Washington
and its allies pressured Pakistan to stop the infiltration and should
keep up the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   India says it won't talk with Pakistan until that country keeps
its promise to stop terrorist infiltration. If Pakistan complies,
India must stop imposing new preconditions for talks.</TE>
<TE>   U.S., British and European Union diplomats should keep calling for
resumption of high-level talks and remind Pakistan that if
infiltration does not stop, India may well send its troops back to
the border.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the international problems posed by Iraq and North
Korea, South Asia with its nuclear menace remains one of the world's
most dangerous regions, a place where the parties in conflict need
help.</TE>

<LD>Ever since the astronauts last set foot on the moon in 1972, people
have been waiting for NASA to take its next "great leap for mankind."</LD>
<LD>   The agency, after all, seemed to stumble in the 1980s, when it
began pouring money into the International Space Station, a
$100-billion boondoggle that has caused plenty of headaches but done
little to advance science. President Bush has rightly asked NASA
Administrator Sean O'Keefe to rein in the station's latest cost
overruns. O'Keefe, however, does not appear ready to scale back the
agency's vision. Nor should he.</LD>
<LD>   This month, at the second World Space Congress in Houston, NASA
unveiled an ambitious blueprint for the future: a space station near
the moon that would be a staging point for building and servicing
space telescopes and for launching manned explorations to Mars and
the rest of the solar system.</LD>
<TE>   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has no delusions
that Congress will fund the mission any time soon: It hasn't even put
a price tag on it. But at the convention of 13,000 international
engineers, scientists and policymakers, NASA tried to do something
interesting and significant: hold out a bold and idealistic vision at
a time when many Americans have become parsimonious with their higher
dreams, thinking them foolish at a time of earthly woes.</TE>
<TE>   President Kennedy similarly tried to milk courage out of fear in a
speech in Houston four decades ago when he established the manned
space program. "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the
other things," he said, "not because they are easy, but because they
are hard.''</TE>
<TE>   OK, so today's legislators are no JFK. In a brazen ploy,
representatives in the House held a hearing recently in which
witnesses spun wildly improbable scenarios of earthly doom they said
would ensue if the Bush administration failed to fund
asteroid-surveillance projects that just happened to be in the
legislators' districts.</TE>
<TE>   One witness testified that if any one of three large meteors that
"barely" missed Earth in the last few years had struck Southern
California, "everyone would have died." Another warned: "We should be
running scared to go out into the solar system. We should be running
fast."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, O'Keefe and his supporters have not figured out how to
appeal to our higher instincts as adeptly as Kennedy did. Still,
their new vision is no less worthy of our embrace.</TE>

now know that there is no such thing as a curse, no such thing as bad

<HD>In a Democracy, Safe Seats Are a Disgrace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bad news in "Chances Fade for Upset in House" (Oct. 28) is not
that the Democratic hope for taking the House is in trouble, but that
American democracy is in a deep coma. If only 16 House seats are up
for grabs, that means that 3.6% of the populace gets to choose a
representative. The other 96.4% might as well be voting in Iraq. If
we take the more generous estimate that 40 seats are not absolutely
safe, we could say that 9% have a voice in the membership of "the
people's house."</LD>
<LD>   This Soviet-style disgrace continues because we allow politicians
to create safe districts for themselves. In Arizona, a nonpartisan
commission creates the districts on a strict per capita formula and
the Legislature can accept or reject the plan in an up-or-down vote.
There, four of five districts, 80%, are at least new enough that
politicians feel compelled to actually go out and meet voters. The
country may be evenly divided between the red and blue states, but it
is difficult to know that for certain when fewer than 10% of
Americans get to express a preference in the one body that was
intended to be close to the people.</LD>

<TE>   Sadly, few Democrats and fewer Republicans are identifying the
"rush to war" in Iraq as the transparently cynical manipulation of
war fever to regain the Senate and retain the House under the rubric
of the war on terrorism (and control of Iraqi oil). This is what it
appears to be elsewhere in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Do we really want the general Islamic world to join Osama bin
Laden in fearing and hating the U.S., adding many foot soldiers to
the current Al Qaeda-Hezbollah-Hamas fanatic suicide cadres, or is
this just "collateral damage"? "Containing" Saddam has worked for 11
years. Why not address hunger, despair, injustice and the growing
rich-poor divide worldwide rather than military provocation?</TE>

<HD>Special Education Class an Inclusive Success</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I read "Special Ed Joins the Mainstream" (Oct. 25) with great
interest because I asked that my children, who have no disabilities,
be placed in the inclusion class at their school, as did many other
parents. Why? Because a well-run inclusion class can be a great
experience for any student. Their class was a multi-age, K-1 double
class of 40 children who shared two rooms. The staff included a
first-grade teacher, a kindergarten teacher, a special education
teacher and a highly skilled instructional aide. That's right, a
ratio of one teacher for every 10 students. Yes, in public school.
Every teacher worked with all the students. Plus, several parents
volunteered in the class every day. It was a wonderful experience.</LD>
<LD>   With their special education emphasis, the teachers were able to
offer flexible education tailored not only for the children who
learned more slowly than average, but also for the students who
learned more quickly. As an added benefit, my children did not think
of the "special" students as special -- they were just other students
in the class. When teachers truly embrace the idea of inclusion, it
is a wonderful model.</LD>

<TE>   Sierra Madre</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article on the problems San Francisco's school district is
having in its attempt to "mainstream" all special education students
illustrates why federal and state law require that a full continuum
of services be available for these students. Forcing students who
require greater services than are available or possible in normal
classrooms to attend general campuses so that they can observe normal
kids compromises the education of both the severely disabled and the
normal students whose valuable classroom time is already stretched
thin.</TE>
<TE>   The zealous advocates of mainstreaming attempted to violate these
laws and eliminate the LAUSD's special education centers under the
mantra of "desegregation." This obvious bigotry of the proponents of
mainstreaming was thwarted by a coalition of parents, educators and
district officials who demanded that the special education centers
remain open to those most in need.</TE>
<TE>   For at least the near future, the most-disabled students,
including my 16-year-old daughter, will continue to have access to
well-equipped and well-designed educational services that will give
them the best chance to succeed in life.</TE>

<HD> Balzar: Go Back to Class on 'Heart of Darkness'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I kept looking for irony in John Balzar's "Peering into Darkness"
(Commentary, Oct. 27) but, unable to find it, can only conclude that
he was sincere in finding parallels between the Bush agenda and
Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness."</LD>
<LD>   Granted, if one substitutes "Bush" for "Kurtz" and "oil" for
"ivory," and draws comparisons between 19th century European
colonialism in Africa and 21st century American nation-building in
the developing world, the analogy is alarmingly apt. But on what
basis does Balzar's rereading of Conrad's novel lead him to conclude
that "being decisive," i.e., launching a preemptive strike on Iraq,
is a good thing?</LD>
<LD>   Balzar's high school English teacher would give him a failing
grade on this one -- he missed the point. Bush -- er, Kurtz -- is not
really a god.</LD>
<TE>   He's a bad guy. Just another greedy white man in the pocket of the
corporations, willing to exterminate the natives in order to exploit
their natural resources. Kind of has a familiar ring to it. Maybe
Balzar needs to read the novel one more time.</TE>

<HD>Pretend Monsters More Fun Than the Real Ones</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Halloween. Time for candied apples, rainbow-colored leaves and, of
course, scary monsters. We love to be frightened by cinematic
creations such as Hannibal, Freddy and Jason. Unfortunately, we also
have some quite real monsters floating around this year: Osama bin
Laden and Saddam Hussein. Nobody appreciates the terror that these
ghouls inspire. Let's see how we've created these monsters ourselves.</LD>
<LD>   Franklin Roosevelt is supposed to have said of a petty dictator:
"He may be an SOB, but at least he's our SOB." During the 1980s, we
could have paid the same compliment to both Bin Laden and Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Saddam's criminal pathology was just fine as long as he vented it
on Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. And Bin Laden was A-OK when he was
blowing up Soviet tanks and not American skyscrapers.</LD>
<TE>   By funding and training homicidal dictators and dangerous
fundamentalists, we have created our own SOBs. The trouble is that
they're not our SOBs any longer.</TE>
<TE>   Like Dr. Frankenstein's creation, our Middle Eastern monsters have
turned against us with a vengeance. The good doctor learned the hard
way that, when you play with dangerous forces, you and countless
innocents can get badly hurt.</TE>
<TE>   We have to stop creating our own monsters. How? Well, many of our
Middle Eastern monsters are pretty oily characters. We need to
overcome our addiction to foreign crude. In the short term, we need
to responsibly exploit our own oil resources. In the long term, we
need to develop alternative energies, such as wind and solar power.
Hussein will never control the wind. Bin Laden can't turn off the
sun.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Frankenstein wanted to control the forces of nature, and his
arrogance unleashed a catastrophe, one that destroyed him. Let's
learn from Frankenstein's experience by controlling our nation's
appetites and ambitions. If we do, then the only monsters will be
those on the movie screen. Oh, and, of course, there are the
4-foot-high vampires, ghosts and witches who will ring our doorbell
and say "trick or treat."</TE>
<TE>   These little monsters are more than welcome at our house. Happy
Halloween!</TE>

<LD>Re "Checkpoint Hours Will Be Reduced," Oct. 23: The highway
checkpoints are part of an overall strategy to discourage illegal
immigration, drug smuggling and terrorism by making it more difficult
to illegally enter the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Lower numbers of intercepts at the checkpoints mean the strategy
is working by driving illegal entrants to more open areas and
separating them from legitimate traffic. Closing the checkpoints will
provide faster access for illegal aliens and terrorists. Rep. Darrell
Issa's (R-Vista) proposal will negatively affect U.S. security.</LD>

<LD>Re "Gas Killed 116 Moscow Hostages," Oct. 28: For two days The Times'
coverage has emphasized the use of gas and the resultant deaths. Your
coverage, had it been interested in the positive to any degree,
should have emphasized how 646 or more hostages were saved by the
actions of the Russian authorities.</LD>
<LD>   It is clear that the terrorists intended to sacrifice themselves
and the theater patrons. That has been demonstrated over and over
again by terrorist groups all over the world and clearly was the only
possible outcome in this case, due to the impossible demands of the
terrorists and the generally acknowledged practice of not granting
demands to terrorists, kidnappers and the like.</LD>
<LD>   Any deaths are a tragedy but inevitable in such a situation. It is
past time, in this day and age, to admit that fact rather than
crucify those who acknowledge it or whose actions save the many but
lose a few. If we support the need for a coordinated and worldwide
effort to stop terrorism, we need to support those who take such
steps. I believe the Russian authorities deserve praise for their
actions. An analysis of the actions is appropriate, in an effort to
improve the results; harsh criticism that does nothing positive is
not.</LD>

<HD>Margaret Booth, 104; Film Editor Had 70-Year Career</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Luther</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Film editor Margaret Booth, who began her career in silent films with
D.W. Griffith and ended it seven decades later editing "The Way We
Were" and other films for producer Ray Stark, has died. She was 104.</LD>
<LD>   Booth, who received an Academy Award nomination for "Mutiny on the
Bounty" (1935) and an honorary Oscar in 1977, died of complications
from a stroke Monday at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "Her collaboration with my company began when she was 70 years
old," Stark said Wednesday, "and her instincts were remarkable even
in her later years, when she saved many a film for me."</LD>
<TE>   Among the many movies Booth edited as a contract "cutter" and
later as a full-fledged editor or supervising editor working for
various Hollywood studios were "Camille" (1936) with Greta Garbo, "A
Yank at Oxford" (1938), "The Red Badge of Courage" (1951), "Fat City"
(1973), "The Sunshine Boys" (1975) and "The Goodbye Girl" (1977). Her
final movie as an editor was "Annie" (1982).</TE>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles on Jan. 16, 1898, Booth started in films in
1915 as a "patcher" -- a film joiner -- for Griffith. He gave her a
job just out of high school after her brother was killed in an
automobile accident and she needed to help out her family. She made
$10 a week.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few years, she was working for Louis B. Mayer at the old
Mission Road studios, where she learned the editing ropes from
director John M. Stahl. She credits Stahl, for whom she edited "The
Gay Deceiver" (1926) and "In Old Kentucky" (1927), with telling her
"the value of a scene ... when [it] drops or doesn't drop, and when
it sustains."</TE>
<TE>   "He would tell me why he went to a close-up," Booth said of the
director in a 1976 interview for Films in Focus. "He said, 'Always
play it in the long shot unless you want to punctuate something.' He
told me the different techniques of cutting."</TE>
<TE>   Booth would work long after hours, practicing on the takes Stahl
threw onto the cutting-room floor.</TE>
<TE>   "One day he couldn't get a sequence the way he wanted it and he
said, 'Did you cut this at all, with the outtakes at night?' " She
had.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I like it. I'll take that.' And he used my cut. So from
then on I started to cut for him."</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, she said, she tried to find the rhythm of a
movie, to craft a film "like poetry."</TE>
<TE>   "When I cut silent films, I used to count to get the rhythm," she
told writer Kevin Brownlow in "The Parade's Gone By," a 1968 book
about silent movies. "If I was cutting a march of soldiers, or
anything with a beat to it, and I wanted to change the angle, I would
count one-two-three-four-five-six. I made a beat for myself."</TE>
<TE>   If the film was a comedy, she stepped up the tempo. If it was a
musical, she cut on the downbeats. "Otherwise, you get a jarring cut
and it throws things off," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You should not feel the breaks," she once said. "It's like pauses
and breaths that you take on the stage. It has its ups and downs and
its pace."</TE>
<TE>   Booth told Brownlow that in her early days cutters would match the
print to the negative without edge numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes there'd be a tiny pinpoint on the negative, and then
you knew you were right," she said. "But it was very tedious work.
Close-ups of Lillian Gish in 'Orphans of the Storm' would go on for
miles, and they'd be very similar, so we had to help one another."</TE>
<TE>   Until Booth came along, film editors, many of them women, had
little status in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "You've seen clips of these women sitting at rows of Moviolas --
they were called cutters because they cut sometimes with scissors,
sometimes with razors," Cari Beauchamp, author of "Without Lying
Down: Frances Marion and the Powerful Women of Early Hollywood," said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Legendary producer Irving Thalberg was the one who began calling
cutters "film editors," starting with Booth, Beauchamp said.</TE>
<TE>   "He depended on her as much as [he did on] any writer," Beauchamp
said. "The two of them would go to a screening and sit next to each
other, making plans for how the re-shoot would be done and how it
would be edited."</TE>
<TE>   The first film Booth edited herself was "The Bridge of San Luis
Rey," released in 1929 -- notable in part because it had a sequence
that was partly sound.</TE>
<TE>   The advent of sound made things much more difficult for cutters,
who now had to worry about keeping the picture and the sound in sync.</TE>
<TE>   But Booth soon figured it out.</TE>
<TE>   "For three decades, no film left [MGM] without her imprint," Ally
Acker wrote in "Reel Women: Pioneers of the Cinema 1896 to the
Present."</TE>
<TE>   The self-effacing Booth didn't think of herself as having an
editing "style."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to go by the style of the director," she once said.</TE>
<TE>   But others told of her commanding presence.</TE>
<TE>   Film editor Dede Allen, who edited "Bonnie and Clyde" (1967) and
was nominated for an Oscar for "Wonder Boys" in 2000, said Wednesday
that director George Roy Hill did a very funny imitation of Booth.</TE>
<TE>   "She had big eyes, she was very small, very much a lady-lady,"
Allen said, "but she had tremendous command."</TE>
<TE>   Once, when editing a film for Hill, Booth was not happy with
something he was doing, Allen said, telling Hill's story.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Hill, are you telling me you want that on a 60-foot screen?"
she demanded.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I don't, do I?" he replied.</TE>
<TE>   "No, you don't," Booth said firmly. In fact, Booth once said, she
preferred directors who stayed out of the cutting room entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them are bad editors," she told Brownlow.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Mayer (no relation to Louis B. Mayer), now president of
Turner Entertainment Co., which owns all MGM films through 1986, said
Booth "represented much of what was good about the studio system: the
loyalty, the continuity, the knowledge of what went on at a
particular studio."</TE>
<TE>   Booth was at MGM from 1937 to 1968 before working for Ray Stark at
Rastar from the mid-1970s until her retirement in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Mayer said Maggie -- he knew her well and could call her by her
nickname, though she preferred most everyone to call her Miss Booth
-- was considered difficult by some in the film business, including
projectionists.</TE>
<TE>   "They complained about her, and she complained about them," Mayer
said. "Because she was a perfectionist."</TE>
<TE>   Stark said, "Margaret was a tough, unsentimental editor who read
film like others would read a book."</TE>
<TE>   Booth probably would have agreed with those assessments.</TE>
<TE>   "They liked me because I was fast," she once said. "And boy, was I
tough."</TE>
<TE>   Booth, who never married, is survived by her cousin, Marie Cetner.
A memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. today at the Good Shepherd
Catholic Church in Beverly Hills.</TE>

<HD>Peggy Moran, 84; Horror Film Scream Queen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peggy Moran, once dubbed one of Hollywood's top "shrieking violets"
for her work in the much-loved cult favorite "The Mummy's Hand" and
other horror films of the early 1940s, has died. She was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Moran, whose meteoric career included 39 films but ended abruptly
with her marriage in 1942, died Friday in Camarillo. Her son, Peter
Koster of Oakland, said she died of complications from injuries
suffered in an automobile accident Aug. 26.</LD>
<LD>   Among Moran's handful of other horror movies were "Horror Island"
and, through footage from "The Mummy's Hand" the subsequent "The
Mummy's Tomb."</LD>
<TE>   There were many, many other films during the brunet beauty's
six-month contract to Warner Bros. and three years with Universal in
an era when a B picture could be churned out in a mere two or three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Among Moran's credits were Ernst Lubitch's 1939 "Ninotchka,"
starring a luminous Greta Garbo, the adventure film "Drums of the
Congo" and westerns including "Rhythm of the Saddle," opposite Gene
Autry, and "King of the Cowboys," opposite Roy Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   Moran co-starred in comedies such as "One Night in the Tropics,"
which was Abbott and Costello's screen debut but was so bad in her
opinion that she and fellow cast member Robert Cummings called it
"One Night in the Flopics."</TE>
<TE>   She was even less impressed with her most memorable picture, "The
Mummy's Hand," calling it "probably the worst picture I ever made ...
a lousy picture."</TE>
<TE>   But it is cable television's fond replaying of that film,
featuring Moran as Marta Solvani, who shrieks fetchingly when a mummy
invades her tent during an Egyptian expedition, that rekindled the
actress' fame and made her a latter-day object of fans' adulation.
She was flown to conventions all over the country, and was invited
last year to Universal's premier of its computer-enhanced "The Mummy
Returns," starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.</TE>
<TE>   Born Marie Jeanette Moran in Clinton, Iowa -- and known as Peggy
throughout her life -- the future actress was the daughter of
ex-dancer Louise Scott and pinup artist Earl Moran, who divorced when
she was 5. Her mother brought her to Hollywood, and at age 6 she
encountered a psychic who looked at her and said, "Ah, an actress."</TE>
<TE>   She took every drama class and acted in every play available at
John Marshall High School, and after graduation was hired by studios.</TE>
<TE>   But her busy career ended abruptly with a marriage proposal and a
somewhat deceptive promise from Harry Koster, director of such
classics as "Harvey," starring James Stewart, and "The Bishop's
Wife," starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven.</TE>
<TE>   "He asked me to give up my career," she told The Times in 2000,
"but he promised he'd put me in every movie he made from then on."</TE>
<TE>   He did -- sort of. Koster had a bust made of Moran's head, and the
bust appeared in all of his films made after their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't matter," she told a fan Web site recently. "I had such
a wonderful life with him, and I was always on the set. In Hollywood,
we were known as the closest couple there was."</TE>
<TE>   Widowed by Koster's death in 1988, she is survived by her son,
Peter, and her stepson, Bob Koster of Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be private.</TE>

<HD>Mary L. Parr, 113; Said to Be Oldest Resident of U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mary L. Parr, believed to be the oldest person in the United States
and second-oldest in the world, died Tuesday at a retirement
community in St. Petersburg, Fla. She was 113.</LD>
<LD>   Parr was determined to be the oldest resident of the United States
by the Gerontology Research Group, a nonprofit organization that
studies aging. She succeeded Adelina Domingues, a California woman
who died Aug. 21 at the age of 114.</LD>
<LD>   Parr, born Feb. 1, 1889, in Mishawaka, Ind., was the world's
second-oldest person at the time of her death, the group said. Only
Kamato Hongo, a 115-year-old Japanese woman, had an authenticated age
older than Parr's.</LD>
<TE>   Parr often told the secret of her longevity: never getting
married.</TE>
<TE>   She spent many years working for the American Red Cross in Cape
May, N.J., first as a volunteer during World War I and then as a paid
employee. She also worked for the South Carolina Tuberculosis
Organization, then moved to Asheville, N.C., to care for her parents,
both of whom lived well into their 90s.</TE>
<TE>   Parr moved to Suncoast Manor, a retirement community in the
Pinellas Point neighborhood of St. Petersburg, in 1965 and lived
there on her own in an apartment until she was 107.</TE>
<TE>   Another Florida resident has apparently become the oldest U.S.
resident, according to the gerontology group. John McMorran, a former
smoker who lives in a Lakeland nursing home, is 113. He was born June
19, 1889.</TE>
<TE>   Parr is believed to have no living relatives. Her sister, Lillian
Prine, died in 1991 at the age of 100.</TE>

affirmative action, died Tuesday at a hospital in Redwood City. He
was 67.</LD>
<LD>   Tien, who was chancellor from 1990 to 1997, was diagnosed with a
brain tumor and suffered an incapacitating stroke during surgery in
September 2000. He spent the last two years under medical care at his
Berkeley home and officially retired from teaching and other duties
last year. He was admitted to the hospital again about 10 days ago as
his condition declined.</LD>
<LD>   The affable and popular campus leader stepped down as chancellor
shortly after a bruising debate on the UC Board of Regents and
throughout the state over affirmative action.</LD>
<TE>   He was one of the highest-ranking public college officials to
condemn Proposition 209, the successful 1996 ballot measure that
repealed government affirmative action programs for women and
minorities.</TE>
<TE>   A mechanical engineer by training who began his teaching career at
Berkeley in 1959, he was a highly regarded expert in heat transfer
technology who helped design and solve problems with the
heat-shielding tiles on the space shuttles as a NASA consultant.</TE>
<TE>   He advised scientists dealing with the nuclear reactor meltdown at
Three Mile Island, and made a major contribution to the design of
magnetic levitation trains in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley's seventh chancellor, Tien spent all but two years of his
four-decade UC career at the Northern California campus, where he
relished mingling with students on Sproul Plaza. All three of his
children are Berkeley graduates.</TE>
<TE>   As chancellor, he weathered severe financial austerities, a wave
of senior faculty retirements, a deadly fraternity house fire and an
apparent assassination attempt by an assailant who disagreed with the
university's plans for Berkeley's fabled People's Park.</TE>
<TE>   "Chang-Lin was an exceptional leader during one of UC Berkeley's
most challenging periods, a time of severe budget cuts and political
changes," said UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl. "His energy
and optimism, his willingness to fight for the principles he
cherished, and his loyalty and love for this campus made it stronger
and better."</TE>
<TE>   Tien frequently invoked his experiences in the United States as a
poor Chinese immigrant in the 1950s when defending affirmative action
programs in higher education.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Wuhan and raised in Shanghai, he was one of eight children
of a well-to-do government banking official who fled with his family
to Taiwan before the Communist takeover of mainland China in 1949. In
Taiwan, Tien and his large family lived as refugees in a
12-foot-by-12-foot room.</TE>
<TE>   Prosperity returned after the former mayor of Shanghai became the
governor of Taiwan in 1950 and made Tien's father his top deputy.</TE>
<TE>   But when his father died of a heart attack two years later, the
family's fortunes were dashed again. All but one member of his family
eventually immigrated to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Tien was the third to arrive. In 1956, the graduate of National
Taiwan University was 21 and nearly penniless when he landed in
Louisville, Ky., to study on a teaching fellowship in the University
of Louisville's department of mechanical engineering.</TE>
<TE>   He stepped right into the pre-civil rights South.</TE>
<TE>   In Louisville, he encountered signs that labeled the washrooms and
drinking fountains either "whites only" or "colored." For a long time
he stood on buses near the driver, until he was finally told to sit
in front with the whites. He avoided the bus for a year after that.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really confused and scared," he said in 1990. "I'm yellow.
I don't know if that's colored or white.</TE>
<TE>   "That left a very deep impression on me. This is a tremendous
injustice to humiliate any human being that way."</TE>
<TE>   In class, a professor called him "chinaman" for three months until
Tien learned that it was pejorative and challenged him. "So he'd say,
'hello,' 'come.' But he never called me 'chinaman' anymore," Tien
said.</TE>
<TE>   When Tien was hired to teach at Berkeley, restrictive covenants
prevented him from buying a house in certain neighborhoods. Decades
later as chancellor, he encountered racism again when the
university's football team won the Citrus Bowl in Florida in 1992 and
hecklers greeted him with chants of "Buy American, Buy American."</TE>
<TE>   Tien earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering at
Louisville before moving on to Princeton, where he obtained a second
master's degree and a doctorate in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   That year he joined Berkeley's faculty. In 1962, he became, at the
age of 26, the youngest professor to receive Berkeley's Distinguished
Teaching Award.</TE>
<TE>   He rose to full professor in 1968 and later headed the department
of mechanical engineering for seven years. He was vice chancellor for
research for two years, from 1983 to 1985.</TE>
<TE>   He was away from Berkeley for only two years, from 1988 to 1990,
when he served as executive vice chancellor at UC Irvine. In that No.
2 post, he was responsible for creating programs to turn the campus
into a nationally prominent research school.</TE>
<TE>   He was on track to become chancellor of UC Irvine when he was
chosen to lead Berkeley, the oldest UC campus, long considered its
flagship.</TE>
<TE>   He became the first Asian American to head a UC campus at a
particularly challenging stage: Tensions were rising over threatened
draconian budget cuts, selective admissions policies that some
charged discriminated against whites and Asians, and a brew of
community issues.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after he arrived, a fraternity house fire killed three
students. Later, a deranged gunman took 30 students hostage at a
local pub, killing one before he was shot to death by police. Two
years into his tenure, his campus residence was invaded by a
machete-wielding activist who was upset with the university's plans
to build volleyball courts and other facilities at People's Park, the
scene of 1960s protests. She was killed when she lunged at police
with the weapon, but Tien and his wife escaped unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   The crises showcased Tien's style. With his thick accent and
goggle-like glasses, the chancellor was feared by some to be a chilly
technocrat, but he proved quite the opposite. After the fire, he
spent the entire day at the fraternity house, soothing students and
even helping to identify one victim's body to spare the parents a
trip to the coroner's office. During the hostage crisis, he was the
first to embrace the students after they were freed and later wrote
personal notes to their parents.</TE>
<TE>   He said the most important crisis he faced as chancellor was the
recession of the early 1990s, which left UC Berkeley with a
$70-million shortfall within four years. During the same period, 27%
of the faculty left on early retirement packages offered to help
offset the fiscal problems. Tien said at the time that the
combination of challenges could mean the difference between Berkeley
being excellent or mediocre.</TE>
<TE>   But the campus lost no academic luster. In 1995, for the third
consecutive decade, UC Berkeley was ranked one of the nation's
premier research universities by the National Research Council.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the credit was given to Tien, who personally recruited top
young scholars to teach at the school and sought to ensure that
prominent professors would remain on the faculty.</TE>
<TE>   He also made fund-raising a top priority.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, he helped bring in more than $975 million,
becoming the most prolific fund-raiser in UC Berkeley history. He
achieved that in part by drawing on the untapped largess of Asian
donors. In the week before he announced his resignation, the school
received a $15-million gift from Taiwanese donors for a new East
Asian library. It was the largest international gift Berkeley had
ever received.</TE>
<TE>   Tien's job heated up again in 1995, when then-Gov. Pete Wilson
pushed the UC Board of Regents to end the use of race, ethnicity or
gender in admissions. The regents voted to ban the policy over the
objections of Tien, the eight other chancellors and faculty leaders
on every campus.</TE>
<TE>   The debate continued the next year, when Proposition 209 was
placed on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Tien spoke out against both drives, even though friends had hinted
that, as he noted in a 1996 New York Times article, "it might make
more sense" for him as an Asian American to support them. Affirmative
action, critics said, gave priority to underrepresented minorities
over qualified Asians and whites. But Tien maintained that the policy
was needed until the playing field was level for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really rather fearless in the way he spoke out on issues,
so much against major currents," said Berkeley Asian American studies
professor Ling-chi Wang, who noted that Tien also spoke out against
Proposition 187, the controversial anti-immigrant measure that was
passed by voters in 1994 but largely invalidated in a court
challenge. "That's what made him such a great leader and
intellectual."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, after reports surfaced that Tien was considering other
jobs, the regents gave him a $20,000 raise. He used $10,000 of it to
start the Berkeley Pledge, a $1-million program to help prepare
disadvantaged students to meet admission requirements at UC Berkeley.
The first concrete step taken by any UC campus to maintain racial
diversity after the regents banned affirmative action, it targeted
youths for the college track as early as the seventh grade, providing
university mentors, special academic coaching and scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Tien's announcement in July 1996 that he planned to resign within
a year caught the campus by surprise. Although there was speculation
that he was embarrassed by the regents' handling of the search for a
new UC president the previous year (several regents had led him to
believe he was a leading candidate), the chancellor acknowledged only
that budget worries and the difficulty of satisfying the often
conflicting constituent groups had made the job more challenging.</TE>
<TE>   He remained on campus as a distinguished professor of engineering
and was the first recipient of UC's presidential medal.</TE>
<TE>   An ardent defender of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos National
Laboratory scientist once suspected of passing nuclear secrets to
China, Tien was active politically as a founder of the Committee of
100, a national organization of prominent Chinese Americans.</TE>
<TE>   His survivors include his wife, Di-Hwa, of Berkeley; daughters
Phyllis, a UC San Francisco physician, and Christine, deputy city
manager of Stockton; a son, Norman, who teaches engineering at UC
Davis; and four grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Nov. 14 at UC Berkeley's
Zellerbach Hall. A reception will follow.</TE>
<TE>   His family requests that memorial donations be made to the UC
Berkeley Foundation for the Chang-Lin Tien Center for East Asian
Studies, c/o Vice Chancellor-University Relations, 2440 Bancroft Way,
No. 4200, UC Berkeley, CA 94720-4200.</TE>

<HD>Kidnappers Take Woman From Her Home</HD>

<BD>From a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police searched Wednesday for two men who kidnapped a 60-year-old
West Covina woman from her home at gunpoint and sped away with her.</LD>
<LD>   The men, one of whom was identified as Miguel Angel Escalera of
Sun Valley, drove into the driveway of Angelina Bejarano's house on
West Sherway Street at 8 p.m. Tuesday and knocked on the door. When
she answered, they grabbed her and hustled her into a dark-colored
SUV, police said. Police declined to discuss the motive.</LD>
<LD>   Bejarano's 31-year-old daughter ran after the abductors, and one
of them grabbed her. She broke free, and one fired a shot at her as
she fled. She wasn't hit.</LD>
<TE>   A witness who didn't want to be identified said the two women
screamed one man's name, asking him to stop. He said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Police traced a phone call from one of the kidnappers to a Sun
Valley residence. There, they found a Mitsubishi Montero similar to
the getaway vehicle but no trace of Bejarano.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Escalera is 29, about 5 feet 7 and 250 pounds, with
letters tattooed on his chest. They said they had no information on
the second man.</TE>

<HD>Panel Accepts Latest Study on Ahmanson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite vehement protests, a Ventura County panel Wednesday approved
a new environmental study of the planned 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch
subdivision at the Los Angeles County line, and sent it to the county
Planning Commission for a second stage of review.</LD>
<LD>   The committee of county staff members unanimously approved the
4,000-page study, saying its exhaustive look at the proposed
mini-city's effect on rare frog and flower species is complete.</LD>
<LD>   Under state law, "the level of analysis does not need to be
perfect," said air quality specialist Chuck Thomas, a member of the
Environmental Report Review Committee. "It must be adequate. And I
think this [environmental impact report] meets that standard."</LD>
<TE>   But the committee told Ahmanson developer Washington Mutual Bank
that it would have to shut down a water well on the ranch if testing
shows it is connected to polluted ground water by a subterranean
plume at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory near Simi Valley. The lab,
where rockets were tested for decades, is two miles from the site of
the proposed community.</TE>
<TE>   The well in question, however, is only about 1,000 feet away from
the project's nearest homes and would be used to irrigate an 18-hole
golf course. Steve Westin, the developer's attorney, said the company
would comply with the request.</TE>
<TE>   In approving the study, the environmental committee discounted
opponents' arguments that the review is flawed because it does not
update a 10-year-old study on the project's effect on traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The committee members also brushed aside critics' demands that
they delay approval until a state water agency explores the potential
health risk of the toxic chemical perchlorate detected in the ranch
well.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an example of irresponsible and reckless government,
especially when it comes to public health and safety," opponent
Tsilah Burman said after the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's public hearing was the sixth the county panel has held
since the hotly contested report landed in its lap early this year.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County supervisors ordered the study after the California
red-legged frog and the San Fernando spineflower were discovered on
the rolling grasslands three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The $2-billion golf course community west of the San Fernando
Valley was first approved by Ventura County in 1992. But years of
litigation and the discovery of the two rare species have delayed
construction. The analysis found that the project would affect the
frogs and flowers but that safeguards would reduce the problem to
acceptable levels.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have assailed the report as insufficient on a number of
fronts. Their criticism Wednesday focused primarily on the discovery
of perchlorate in the one well.</TE>
<TE>   Perchlorate, which has been linked to thyroid problems, was found
last summer in a 550-foot-deep sample at 28 micrograms per liter,
seven times higher than new state safety guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Though government officials have not yet pinpointed the source of
the contamination, critics said it could have migrated in aquifers
from the Santa Susana lab, the site of rocket and nuclear reactor
testing after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Without clear information about the chemical's source, opponents
pleaded with the panel to delay approval of the study.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a shadow of a doubt that there is a threat to human
health, you must take every step possible to investigate this," said
Susan Cashman, a West Hills resident.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the housing project also turned out at Wednesday's
hearing, although many of them did not speak. They sat in the
audience wearing neon-green stickers that read, "Yes, Build It."</TE>
<TE>   If the report passes muster with the Planning Commission next
month, it will move to the Board of Supervisors for a final vote.</TE>

another step in a long process. But it's an important one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the report passes muster with the Planning Commission next
month, it will move to the Board of Supervisors for a final vote.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters would like to see that happen before January, when
Ahmanson critic Linda Parks joins the board.</TE>
<TE>   One other supervisor, Steve Bennett of Ventura, has already voiced
concerns that the report is insufficient, especially since it does
not include a new traffic study.</TE>
<TE>   Project critics believe Supervisors John K. Flynn or Kathy Long
are on the fence and could be persuaded to form the three-supervisor
majority needed to reject the study.</TE>
<TE>   If that were to happen, developer Washington Mutual would have to
conduct another time-consuming environmental review--an economic
hardship that opponents hope would derail the project for good.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the project had nearly given up on stopping the
subdivision after about a dozen failed lawsuits. But the campaign got
new life last year when Hollywood director Rob Reiner joined the
fight.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner helped form Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, a
celebrity-studded opposition group, and has succeeded in urging
politicians across the state to denounce the project.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, former Vice President Al Gore also weighed in,
urging that the oak-studded land be saved as open space.</TE>

<LD>Speaking at a town hall meeting in Reseda, Los Angeles Police Chief
William J. Bratton said Wednesday night the San Fernando Valley would
benefit along with the rest of the city from the top-to-bottom
reforms he is proposing to strengthen his department and its
partnership with the community.</LD>
<LD>   The new chief repeated his intention to crack down on the
profusion of guns on city streets and to root out hard-core street
gangs. "Job one is going to be reducing crime throughout the city,"
Bratton said. "We can beat the gangbangers. We can beat the
terrorists."</LD>
<LD>   His appearance before several hundred in the Reseda High School
auditorium capped a busy itinerary for Bratton, who has crisscrossed
the city several times in recent weeks as part of a get-acquainted
tour.</LD>
<TE>   Bratton began the day at the West Valley Division. He later was on
hand with Mayor James K. Hahn to dedicate a West Valley regional
public library branch and at a groundbreaking for a new West Valley
police station, which will replace the existing Reseda facility. The
station is scheduled to be completed in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton returned to Parker Center downtown only to head off again
to Highland Park for a "meet the mayor" event, which consisted of
one-on-one discussions with selected constituents on public safety
and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   At that event, Bratton heard from a woman whose son's friend was
gunned down by gang members at a party. Rosa Rivas praised the work
of the senior lead officer in her community but said he could not do
the job alone and asked that new Police Academy graduates be assigned
to the Northeast Division. Bratton vowed to move more officers to
areas where they are most needed.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Bratton's time, however, was spent in the Valley. With the
vote on Valley secession a few days away, neither Hahn nor Bratton
mentioned it specifically in their remarks. Bratton's only public
response on the issue occurred the day he was named chief. "I can't
even begin to imagine why [anyone] would want to secede from L.A.,"
he said at the time.</TE>

<TE>   Hahn and L.A. Councilman Dennis Zine said city bond money was
being used to build the West Valley Station -- as well as the
adjacent library -- and that people remember the city "delivered what

<LD>Citing poor supervision at a West Hills psychiatric hospital where
two teenage patients were assaulted, the Los Angeles County
Department of Mental Health is planning to strip the private facility
of its ability to treat some patients, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Under such a mandate, Pine Grove Hospital would lose its ability
to detain and treat mentally ill patients admitted involuntarily,
said David Meyer, the agency's chief deputy director.</LD>
<LD>   Pine Grove administrators will have 30 days to respond to the
findings, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Law enforcement authorities have investigated five reported
incidents of sexual molestation in the last three years involving
patients and former patients.</TE>
<TE>   Two former employees and a 17-year-old patient have since been
convicted of sexually assaulting teenage girls they met at the
hospital.</TE>

<LD>A publicly funded health plan is donating $200,000 to temporarily
reopen four school-based medical clinics in Los Angeles County that
closed recently because of budget cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The grant from L.A. Care Health Plan will allow the clinics at
four L.A. Unified schools to operate for four months, said John
Wallace, a spokesman for the county Department of Health Services.
The clinics provided free walk-in services to about 200 children each
month.</LD>
<LD>   To keep the centers open after the four months, Wallace said, the
Board of Supervisors will have to look for more funds.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city and county of Los Angeles approved payments totaling more
than $1 million to settle lawsuits stemming from two separate police
shootings, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved
payment of $925,000 in the lawsuit of Grover Smith of Northridge, a
bystander shot in the leg nearly six years ago by officers who
mistook him for a robbery suspect.</LD>
<LD>   Smith's attorney, Stephen Yagman, denied that the lawsuit is
settled, and called the allocation "wishful thinking" by the council
and the city attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors approved a settlement of $200,000
for the next-door neighbors of a Stevenson Ranch man killed in a
fiery Aug. 31, 2001, gun battle with federal agents and sheriff's
deputies. The officials were trying to serve a search warrant on
James Allen Beck, who barricaded himself in his home and opened fire
on the officers, killing Deputy Hagop "Jake" Kuredjian.</TE>
<TE>   The county will pay $167,500 to Phil and Marilyn Lombardi, who
were forced to hide in their bathroom with their day-old daughter
Gianna after sheriff's deputies mistook their house for Beck's and
fired more than 100 rounds into it.</TE>
<TE>   The county also approved payment of $32,500 to neighbor Steve
Rizzo and his 4-year-old daughter, who waited trapped in their home
for several hours.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing a "crisis" in convention bookings, the managers of six
downtown hotels called Wednesday for Mayor James K. Hahn to press for
the replacement of George Kirkland as president of the Los Angeles
Convention and Visitors Bureau.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Hahn, the hotel general managers threatened to stop
paying membership dues unless he steps in and effects "an immediate
change in leadership" at the bureau, which is mostly funded by the
city through a contract.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn spokeswoman Hilda Delgado said the bureau's board, not Hahn,
has the power to appoint and replace the president. She said the
mayor had no comment on the letter.</LD>
<TE>   In a recent radio interview, Hahn signaled that he was watching
the performance of Kirkland and the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   In their letter, the hoteliers criticized the board for refusing
to accept Kirkland's offer earlier this month to resign.</TE>
<TE>   "The gross mismanagement of the bureau is unprecedented and yet
the board has stated that Mr. Kirkland has done a good job" the hotel
executives said in the letter, released Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland did not return calls for comment, but bureau board
Chairman Alan Rothenberg issued a statement that defended Kirkland
and the board against the hoteliers' criticism.</TE>

<HD>Taxi Driver Guilty in Fellow Cabbie's Fatal Shooting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury on Wednesday convicted a former taxi driver of voluntary
manslaughter for shooting another cabbie to death after what
authorities say began as a murder-suicide pact.</LD>
<LD>   Chae Jung Han, 56, faces up to 12 years in prison when he is
sentenced Jan. 31 by Orange County Superior Court Judge Kazuharu
Makino.</LD>
<LD>   Han, 56, David Keum Yung Ji, 55, and Hyang Baek, 55, all
cabdrivers from Garden Grove, drove around Orange County in Ji's cab
April 26, 2000. They were drinking soju, a Korean drink similar to
vodka, discussing their financial troubles and contemplating suicide,
a prosecutor said.</LD>
<TE>   Han parked the car at the Newport Beach Pier parking lot, where
they had planned to carry out their pact, prosecutors say. Han shot
Baek in the head with Baek's .38-caliber revolver. After the
shooting, Ji--who apparently had changed his mind about
dying--struggled for the gun and handed it to police when they
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Ji also faced murder charges, but he pleaded guilty to being an
accessory to murder and was placed on three years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn Carlisle-Raines said the law prohibits
assisted suicides.</TE>
<TE>   "The men were despondent and had talked about dying,"
Carlisle-Raines said. "But you can't consent to being murdered. The
laws of the state don't permit that."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Constance Istratescu could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   During the monthlong trial she argued that there was no evidence
who fired the shot because no recognizable fingerprints could be
found on the gun.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she argued, either Ji fired the shot or Baek killed
himself.</TE>
<TE>   The drivers were depressed about their jobs because they had not
been hired by a new company that had contracted with John Wayne
Airport.</TE>

<LD>Sacramento</LD>
<LD>   It figures: This dreary, repulsive race for governor is nearing an
end in the gutter.</LD>
<LD>   An old accusation by a once-desperate political racketeer surfaces
amid the campaign muck. A desperate dark-horse candidate, Bill Simon
Jr., picks up the crud and tries to use it.</LD>
<TE>   Standing on the beach at Malibu, behind a tacky podium and in
front of cameras, Simon demands that Gov. Gray Davis come clean --
fess up how his political pay-for-play has infected the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Simon may not have heard: His problem is not that voters need to
be convinced Davis is a voracious money-raiser who returns favors for
donors. Voters assume all politicians do that. Simon's problem is he
still hasn't convinced voters that he is an acceptable alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Polls, incidentally, consistently have shown that voters consider
Davis more honest than Simon, the businessman-investor.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, the accused governor -- accused by a convicted
extortionist with zero credibility -- adamantly denies the allegation
that, long ago, he pushed for Coastal Commission approval of projects
so he could hit up the happy applicants for campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "Scurrilous," Davis says.</TE>
<TE>   Some recap is needed here:</TE>
<TE>   Mark L. Nathanson, a Hollywood bagman for then-Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown and Brown's appointee on the Coastal Commission, was
convicted of extorting payments from celebrities seeking permits to
build on the Southern California coast. Nathanson was one of 14 pols
-- including lawmakers and lobbyists -- convicted after an FBI sting
in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Nathanson was sent to prison for nearly five years. In 1993, he
offered to rat on Davis for a lighter sentence, asserting he could
prove that the then-state controller had urged him to obtain approval
of coastal projects for potential donors.</TE>
<TE>   This is a line I particularly enjoyed in the letter to prosecutors
from Nathanson's attorney: "Nathanson has to date been unable to
recall any specific conversation with Davis about the ... matter
(although recollection of one may click into his memory at any
time).... "</TE>
<TE>   Also: "I believe Nathanson's memory regarding specific Davis
incidents will get better the more he thinks about it."</TE>
<TE>   The next year, another Nathanson attorney wrote prosecutors: "Mark
has now recalled that Davis specifically promised him four
inheritance tax appraiser appointments" for a coastal deal.</TE>
<TE>   Quid pro quo. That would be illegal. The other accusations -- I
need a favor -- seem perfectly legal.</TE>
<TE>   At any rate, the U.S. attorney didn't bite, explaining to a judge
years later that Nathanson "lied during debriefings, withheld
information, described conduct which was not legal and/or provided
information which could not be corroborated."</TE>
<TE>   Liberal U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton sealed the Nathanson
letters, trying to shield Davis and others from "hearsay
accusations." The Sacramento Bee sued, won, and on Monday the judge
was forced to unseal the letters -- eight days before the election.</TE>
<TE>   The judge probably would have done Davis a favor by releasing the
documents years ago. They'd be long forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   Unless there's truth to these allegations. Then the memories of
other people surely will be jogged. And they might rat. But that
seems highly unlikely, since the only person who has ever leveled the
charges was a racketeer looking for a prison break.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are disturbing side issues here:</TE>
<TE>   * Even if somebody did do what Davis was accused of, most of it
would be legal. Should it be?</TE>
<TE>   Should a politician be able to use the Coastal Commission or any
regulatory agency as a fund-raising tool? I was happy to help. Next
week I'm having a fund-raiser. It subverts the regulatory process,
favoring big donors.</TE>
<TE>   * The reaction this week from Democrats was that Davis didn't do
it, but, even if he did, this sort of thing happens regularly.</TE>
<TE>   "Politicians call on a daily basis lobbying for their friends or
supporters," says one government insider. "It's not at all illegal or
even untoward. The appearance isn't good.</TE>
<TE>   "Politics is ugly when you look below the surface at the innards.
It's nothing we don't walk through knee-deep every day in
government."</TE>
<TE>   And this concession from a legislative insider: "You gain office
through the private sector. Then once you're elected, you're supposed
to represent the public interest without regard to how you got there.</TE>
<TE>   "People who invest [money] in candidates believe they will vote
their interest. You don't break that cycle unless voters decide they
want to make campaigns public activity."</TE>
<TE>   Public financing of campaigns. The public gets what it pays for.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's getting a lot of muck and ugly innards.</TE>

<CX>   Mark Nathanson -- George Skelton's Capitol Journal column Thursday in
the California section contained a typographical error that changed
the meaning of a quote. It should have read that the U.S. attorney
explained to a judge that convicted felon Mark L. Nathanson described
conduct about Gov. Gray Davis "which was not illegal," rather than
"not legal," as the story erroneously said.</CX>

<HD>Mahony's Top Chiefs All Resign</HD>
<DH>Budget cuts at the L.A. Archdiocese as well as personal
factors appear to push the five managers to step down in joint
announcement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All five of Cardinal Roger M. Mahony's top executives have resigned
their posts, church officials said Wednesday, a sign of continuing
turmoil in the nation's largest Roman Catholic archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   Several church sources familiar with the departures said the moves
were linked, at least in part, to a feeling among the executives that
Mahony had failed to consult them last month when he eliminated or
severely cut the budgets of at least seven church programs to close a
$4.3-million deficit. The budget cuts have required layoffs of
roughly 60 church employees.</LD>
<LD>   Mahony's spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on the
resignations.</LD>
<TE>   All five of the executives signed an e-mail Wednesday afternoon to
employees at the headquarters of the archdiocese announcing that they
were leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "We've come to this at different times" for varying reasons, one
of the executives said Wednesday night. "The announcement is made
together. We didn't make the decisions together." But the official
added that Mahony did not ask for their resignations and that their
decisions were their own.</TE>
<TE>   Another of the five, reached at home, refused comment but said an
official announcement would be made today.</TE>
<TE>   The resignations caught priests and other church workers by
surprise. Most declined to comment by name, but Father Vicente Lopez,
pastor of St. Raphael Church in South-Central Los Angeles, called the
developments stunning.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is very tenuous, and it's spooky, very
Halloweenish, because it's not clear who is going to do what," Lopez
said. The departure of at least some of the executives was a "logical
consequence" of the budget cuts, which had left some of them with
little to supervise, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Another priest, who asked to remain anonymous, said, "Obviously
the question is, is this a comment on the cardinal?"</TE>
<TE>   Mahony and other archdiocesan officials have said that the cuts in
the budget were needed to close a deficit caused by losses in the
stock market. Others have pointed to the church's need to set aside
money against the future costs of sexual-abuse settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Many priests in the archdiocese, however, have pointed to the
costs of the new $189-million Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in
downtown Los Angeles. Mahony has insisted the cathedral costs are
unrelated to the budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The five executives who are leaving oversee a broad range of
church functions -- including schools, personnel, charitable giving
and outreach ministries -- in the archdiocese, which serves 5 million
Catholics in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   Among those resigning from their posts was Msgr. Terrance Fleming,
who as vicar general of the archdiocese serves, in effect, as
Mahony's chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   The others are Sister Cecilia Louise Moore, who as chancellor of
the archdiocese oversees its charitable foundations as well as its
personnel office; Msgr. Richard Loomis, who heads the secretariat for
administrative services; Sister Bernadette Murphy, who oversees the
church's educational programs; and Thomas Chabolla, a layman who
heads the church offices for pastoral and community services.</TE>
<TE>   Church sources said some of the resignations were influenced by
personal factors. Fleming, for example, had long planned to step down
as vicar general to take a sabbatical, the sources said. Fleming, who
is reportedly in England, was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, who is 74, was nearing the end of her term of office and is
undergoing treatment for cancer.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, the resignations appear to be tied more
exclusively to the budget cuts and what some see as a distant and
authoritarian style of decision-making by Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   Chabolla, for example, heads the church secretariat that oversees
the ministries hardest hit by the budget cuts. Those included
outreach to ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, lesbian and
gay Catholics, and ecumenical and inter-religious affairs.</TE>
<TE>   One priest who had spoken with Chabolla said he felt he had been
left out of the decision-making on the cuts. "They were left in the
position of having to make these cuts and layoffs, and I think some
of them felt really in a very bad position because they hadn't been
part of the decision-making process," the priest said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was very little consultation in a post-Vatican II church
where people are consulted broadly," another priest said. "How could
there be such an incredible decision of such magnitude and be such a
surprise to everybody?"</TE>
<TE>   Another source, who saw the e-mail, said a new management team was
expected to be in place by early next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows what it's going to look like. No one wants the top
job because it's too vague," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the resignations came less than a month after priests in
the archdiocese personally confronted Mahony over the budget cuts
during an annual meeting.</TE>
<TE>   At the time some priests told Mahony that his management style was
"paternalistic" and "unilateral." But there was no hint at the time
that the cardinal's highest-ranking managers were planning to resign.</TE>

<HD>Healer's Patient Described as Desperate</HD>
<DH>Dead man's son speaks out. Authorities seek help from
others who may have been treated by Van Nuys woman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Luis Caceres said his 54-year-old father was desperate when he
arrived at the doorstep of a Van Nuys faith healer Monday evening for
an injection that police believe killed him.</LD>
<LD>   Roberto Caceres, a handyman, had suffered from an irritating body
rash that medical doctors couldn't seem to cure, his son said
Wednesday at a news conference outside the Van Nuys police station.</LD>
<LD>   The rash caused the elder Caceres to miss so much work that his
employer threatened to fire him, Caceres said. Without a job, his
father would lose his medical insurance.</LD>
<TE>   "My dad was sick for two years. He went to a lot of doctors,"
Caceres said. "He had an HMO. They never wanted to go the extra mile
for him.... They always gave him the same medicines. It didn't help."</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Caceres heard about Reina Isabel Chavarria on a popular
morning show on a Spanish-language radio station and traveled from
Santa Ana to the modest white house in the 15700 block of Marlin
Place for help.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a lot of faith in this girl," Caceres said. "He didn't
know he would die."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had begged his father not to go, but his father was
afraid that his persistent illness would cost him his job and medical
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a feeling it was not the right thing," the son said.</TE>
<TE>   Caceres spoke near a framed photograph of his parents, Roberto and
Hilda Caceres, and mug shots of the women accused of killing his
father.</TE>
<TE>   Chavarria, 48, and her assistant, Margarita Montes, 28, were
arrested Monday on suspicion of manslaughter, which carries a bail of
$25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Chavarria posted bail and was released from Van Nuys jail before
prosecutors filed additional charges Wednesday and asked that bail be
raised to $75,000. She is set to be arraigned Nov. 19.</TE>
<TE>   The women were charged Wednesday with two felonies, involuntary
manslaughter and the unauthorized practice of medicine causing death.</TE>
<TE>   Montes pleaded not guilty Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior
Court. She is being held in lieu of $75,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, each defendant faces up to nine years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the first time Roberto Caceres went to Chavarria's
house, he paid $310 and was given ointments and pills. These didn't
cure the rash and he returned Monday for two injections, costing
$140.</TE>
<TE>   Montes first told Roberto Caceres and his wife that the first
injection was vitamin B12, said Los Angeles Police Det. Al Aldaz.
Then, she said, the patient looked nervous and she offered him a
second injection of an unknown substance.</TE>
<TE>   After the shot, Caceres went into convulsions and died minutes
later at Valley Presbyterian Hospital, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Aldaz said the women refused to call for emergency help and forced
Roberto Caceres and his family out of her house as soon as he fell
ill.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers were nearby on an unrelated matter and responded
to cries from family members for help, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities still do not know what the injections were. They are
awaiting the results of an autopsy to be performed today.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives are seeking the public's help in locating other
possible victims and to learn more about the defendants, who have
lived together in Van Nuys for about a year.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call the Los Angeles Police
Department Homicide Division at (818) 756-8377 or the watch commander
at (818) 756-8346.</TE>

<HD>Davis Helped Gambling Hit $6-Billion Jackpot</HD>
<DH>Only Nevada exceeds California's annual revenue since he
signed casino compacts, bills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis, who repeatedly has said he endorses
merely modest growth of gambling, instead has presided over a rapid
expansion, fueled by the rise of casinos on Indian land.</LD>
<LD>   Since Davis signed compacts with Native American tribes in 1999,
his first year in office, revenue at Indian casinos has more than
tripled, from $1.5 billion in 1999 to about $5 billion a year, and
the number of casinos has grown to 50, up from 38 in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Davis also has signed legislation expanding off-track betting on
horse races and ensuring that card rooms can continue to operate. The
California Lottery continues to flourish as well, with more games and
more people buying tickets than ever.</LD>
<TE>   Altogether, revenue to casinos, card rooms and racetracks
approaches $6 billion a year. Under Davis' watch, California
operators' winnings has surpassed New Jersey's $4.3 billion, and is
second to Nevada's $9.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "For sure, California is the fastest-growing state in terms of
gaming revenue, slot machine growth and employment," said Jason Ader,
gambling industry analyst for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. "There are
countries that could be comparable ... but not individual states."</TE>
<TE>   The rise of tribal casinos has created a new political force in
California, evident in campaign contributions and in local land-use
disputes. Taken together, tribes have become among the state's
richest campaign donors, having spent more than $120 million on
ballot measures and legislative and statewide races since 1998. Davis
has accepted $1.34 million from the tribes since he took office in
1999, and gambling interests altogether account for about $2.5
million of the $67 million he has raised in that period.</TE>
<TE>   Major Test</TE>
<TE>   Neither Davis nor his Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr. have
discussed gambling in any detail during the campaign. The next
governor will face a major test early next year when negotiations
reopen over key parts of the compact with the tribes, including the
number of slot machines that tribes can have. Simon and Davis refused
in recent days to discuss how they would handle the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent campaign stop, Davis said he has kept his promise
about "not letting the number of machines get out of hand." He
portrayed himself as having had little choice about how he handled
the compact negotiations in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm responding to the will of the electorate," Davis said. He
added that a 1988 federal law requires governors to negotiate with
tribes over the extent of gambling. "I have to follow the law," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and tribal representatives cite economic gains for
California Indians brought about by gambling. Employment by tribes
grew to 35,000 in the last year, a 12% jump. "If tribes make money,
good things happen," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 deal, which was ratified by the Legislature and approved
by voters, grants California's 105 bands of Native Americans
exclusive rights to operate casinos with slot machines and various
other games of chance on their land. Proposition 1-A, drafted by the
Davis administration, permits casinos on Indian land. It amended a
state constitutional provision, approved in 1986 when voters
authorized the state lottery, that specifically barred "Nevada-style
casinos" in California.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, each tribe can have two casinos with a combined
2,000 slot machines, about the number in large Las Vegas Strip
casinos. Tribes without casinos or with relatively small casinos were
promised payments of $1.1 million a year from the bigger tribes.</TE>
<TE>   "For too long, California's Indians have been denied the respect
and dignity they deserve," Davis said in 1999. "That sad chapter in
our history ends today."</TE>
<TE>   His words marked an about-face for the state. Davis' predecessor,
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, had blocked tribes from any significant
expansion. Federal authorities had sued to shut down the casinos.</TE>
<TE>   Tribes reacted by spending $63 million to win passage of
Proposition 5 in 1998. Proposition 5 would have given them the right
to operate casinos of any size on their land, but the state Supreme
Court struck it down in August 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The compacts ended the uncertainty and launched a construction
blitz.</TE>
<TE>   "What the Davis administration did with those compacts was ...
secure and legitimize the industry for the foreseeable future," said
attorney Howard Dickstein, who represents five casino tribes. "That
had a tremendous impact."</TE>
<TE>   Tribes File Suit</TE>
<TE>   But some have been critical of the compacts, which are based on a
single template, complaining of ambiguity or that they give the state
little power to regulate the casinos. Two tribes sued earlier this
week seeking to clarify parts of the document. "The compact is
woefully inadequate," said Sonoma County Counsel Steven Woodside,
among the officials fighting unsuccessfully to stop an Indian casino,
financed by a Texas company, in the wine country of Alexander Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The governor publicly has been ambivalent about gambling, often
vetoing bills one year, then signing similar measures later. In 1999
and 2001, he rejected bills to permit more mule racing and allow
horse tracks to increase the size of purses, thus adding to the
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not personally favor gambling, and I certainly do not
encourage others to gamble," Davis said as he vetoed the mule racing
bill. "Therefore, I am not generally inclined to support measures
that allow more than a modest expansion of gaming."</TE>
<TE>   Davis reversed himself this year by signing a single bill allowing
more mule racing and richer purses. With the growth of gambling has
come conflict. In San Diego County, there have been disputes over a
tribe's demand for water for its resort, and the county's eight
casinos worsen sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody anticipated the wildly dramatic dimensions of the
development," said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who like most
legislators voted for measures approving tribal casinos. "Clearly, we
made a mistake. I don't know how to fix it."</TE>
<TE>   In the state's rural reaches, residents can do little to stop
casino development. That has become obvious at the Dry Creek
Rancheria in the Alexander Valley, a prime wine grape region.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer in July wrote to the Pomo Indians
complaining that they failed to comply with the compact's safety and
environmental provisions, and asking to meet to resolve the dispute.
Three months later, construction crews financed by Nevada Gold &amp;
Casino Inc., of Houston, remain hard at work, having bulldozed the
tops of hills to accommodate a casino with 1,600 slots. Gamblers
already play slot machines in a finished section.</TE>
<TE>   There are no water or sewer lines to the casino. Water is trucked
up, and sewage trucked out. Sonoma County Fire Marshal Jack Rosevear
warned in an affidavit of fire danger on the brush- and oak-covered
hillside. A blaze "could present a serious problem for guests in
terms of panic from smoke and possible fire exposure," Rosevear said.
The road to the casino may be too narrow for firetrucks to squeeze
past fleeing vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The tribe's attorney, Frank R. Lawrence, responded by telling
Sonoma County officials that they have no authority over the
construction, and warning that if they return, they're "at grave risk
of personal individual liability in a federal civil rights lawsuit
that the tribe is presently contemplating."</TE>
<TE>   Looking for Help</TE>
<TE>   If Davis' first term has brought security to the state's gambling
industry, the winner of Tuesday's election may be tempted to look to
the industry for help with California's returning budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Given that tribes pay no state taxes on casino profits, the next
governor could agree to raise the cap of 2,000 slots machines per
tribe so long as tribes help the state solve its fiscal crisis by
paying some form of fee or tax. Connecticut, home to the largest
Indian casino, receives 20% of the operation's slot machine revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Slots are especially lucrative, with each device bringing in
$100,000 or more a year. Ten tribes have 2,000 slots each, or nearly
that number. Some may seek to remove the cap.</TE>
<TE>   "The tribes hope the governor would be open to letting the market
decide," said Jacob Coin, director of the California Indian Nations
Gaming Assn., a lobby group in Sacramento. Aware that tribes may be
asked to help bail out the state, Coin said: "Clearly, there will be
a search for more revenue."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how many slot machines the tribes can amass under the
current company remains in dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The hastily drawn agreement is ambiguous on this key point. Davis
initially contended that the compacts limited tribes to a combined
total of no more than 40,000 slots, twice the 19,137 machines in
operation in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The nonpartisan state Legislative Analyst contends the compact
permits 113,000 machines.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a middle ground, the California Gambling Control Commission
places the number of machines authorized under the compact at 61,957.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the latest number of 44,913 machines in operation, Davis
said the deal he struck "allowed for a modest increase in the number
of machines.... I think we've kept our promise."</TE>

<HD>$6 Million for Observatory Project to Come From Bond</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis announced Wednesday that Los Angeles will receive $6
million from the state in voter-approved park bond money to help
renovate and expand the aging Griffith Park Observatory.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference with Mayor James K. Hahn and other local
officials, the leaders never mentioned that L.A. had asked for $12
million from the money raised by Proposition 40, approved two years
ago. Instead, officials said they were pleased about the money.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a very important landmark," Davis said. "The Griffith
Observatory is as much a part of Los Angeles' history as the
Hollywood sign and the Santa Monica Pier." (The pier is in Santa
Monica, not L.A.)</LD>
<TE>   "My hope is that the observatory will keep the farthest reaches of
space within the reaches of every child who comes up here," Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the observatory is an institution treasured by residents
and a great draw for tourists. Visitors, in particular, want to see
the building because it has been prominently featured in films for so
many years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it was attacked by aliens or in a James Dean movie ... it
is one of the places people almost always stop by on their visits,"
the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the observatory, closed since January, call for
extensive renovations, including cleaning of the copper domes and
construction of a theater to be named after actor Leonard Nimoy of
"Star Trek." Nimoy donated $1 million to the project.</TE>
<TE>   The remodeling will retain the observatory's Art Deco architecture
while the expansion occurs underground for the theater. The cafe and
terrace also are being renovated.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no major improvements to the observatory since it
opened in 1935.</TE>

<HD>Donation to Reopen 4 Clinics</HD>
<DH>The school-based health-care facilities, closed by county
budget cuts, will be kept afloat for four months by $200,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Erika Hayasaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A publicly funded health plan is donating $200,000 to temporarily
reopen four school-based medical clinics in Los Angeles County --
three of them in the San Fernando Valley -- that closed recently
because of budget cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The grant from L.A. Care Health Plan will allow the clinics at
four Los Angeles Unified School District campuses to operate for the
next four months, said John Wallace, a spokesman for the county
Department of Health Services. The county had funded the clinics,
which offer free walk-in services to a total of about 200 children
each month.</LD>
<LD>   To keep the centers open beyond the four months, Wallace said, the
county Board of Supervisors will have to look for more donations,
grants or county funding.</LD>
<TE>   "We're delighted," said Maria Reza, assistant superintendent for
student health and human services for L.A. Unified. "Without these
clinics, many of these students would not have access to any medical
services."</TE>
<TE>   The county board voted in August to close the clinics and 11 other
community health centers. That trimmed $31.3 million from next year's
health budget, but the health department still faces a deficit of as
much as $750 million in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the clinics at Vaughn Street Charter School in San
Fernando, Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, Pacoima Middle School
and Gardena High School stopped providing such services to students
and their siblings as immunization, pediatric care, health screenings
and treatment for conditions like asthma, ear infections and soar
throats.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 10 employees were reassigned, according to Gretchen
McGinley, a county official who was in charge of the three Valley
clinics. Those workers may return over the next several weeks, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   McGinley said she is happy that the clinics will have more time to
look for permanent funding. But she added that the economic
challenges are so serious that she is worried the centers may shut
down again.</TE>
<TE>   "I have hope," she said. "But I don't have confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace said shutting the facilities again is a possibility but
"not something we want to do." L.A. Care oversees state and federal
government-funded managed-care plans that serve more than 800,000
recipients of aid from Medi-Cal, CaliforniaKids and Healthy Families
in Los Angeles County. After covering its costs, the organization
uses its resources to help other nonprofit health-care efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The 13 L.A. Care Health Plan board members, who represent medical
and health-care professionals as well as Medi-Cal consumers, approved
the grant to the county Oct. 3, said Jo Ann Yanagimoto-Pinedo, a
spokeswoman for the organization. On Tuesday, the Board of
Supervisors voted to accept the funds.</TE>
<TE>   School-based clinics support the organization's mission to serve
low-income families and children, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Howard A. Kahn said the funds "give L.A. Care an
opportunity to assist in providing children with needed access to
health-care services."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Rivera, a nurse at Pacoima Middle School, said she has been
swamped with students since the clinic closed. Previously, the school
sent its 300 seventh-graders to the facility for immunizations, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Rivera and a part-time nurse administer them. "I will be very
grateful if they open it back up," she said of the clinic. "There are
so many students and so few nurses."</TE>
<TE>   Yvonne Chan, principal of the 1,400-student Vaughn Street Charter
Elementary School, said the clinic there is badly needed, because
many of her students are immigrants who have nowhere else to turn for
services.</TE>
<TE>   "It serves kids who live in poverty," she said. "It is a very
needy school, and achievement will not happen without kids being
healthy."</TE>

<HD>In 24 Years, Food Program Grows to Feed Thousands of Needy
Citizens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were talking about all the food that went to waste in the fields
of Ventura County. There were seven of them, sitting in a garage,
thinking how great it would be if they could get some of that food
and give it to the homeless.</LD>
<LD>   That was 24 years ago, and it was the start of the largest food
bank in Ventura County -- an operation that now distributes $10
million worth of food a year to thousands of citizens, with a special
emphasis on children.</LD>
<LD>   Jewel Pedi remembers that day. She and the others decided to take
matters into their own hands, and hit the farmlands to glean whatever
they could from the fields to pass along to the needy. They came back
with a few boxes of cabbage.</LD>
<TE>   "That was the start," she said last week, sitting in one of the
offices of the huge Oxnard warehouse that is now the storage center
for the thousands of pounds of food distributed daily by Food Share
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Within two months, we had 75 gleaners," she said. After two
years, the group moved into an old fire station, "and we were
distributing up to about 5,000 pounds of food a week."</TE>
<TE>   Pedi ran the organization for the next 15 years. Today, it serves
320,000 meals a month to more than 38,000 people. A force of 500
volunteers gleans the waste from the county's fields and helps with
warehouse operations. James Mangis is president; Pedi is the program
director.</TE>
<TE>   A program called Kids Cafe brings a special passion to Pedi's
tone. "If you have an empty stomach, you cannot study," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kids Cafe serves about 3,000 children every week. "About half our
Kids Cafes have kitchens that can serve hot meals in the afternoon
during the school year and breakfast and dinner during summer. The
others have microwaves and blenders for things like pizza and tacos
and smoothies."</TE>
<TE>   "But there are a lot more kids who need this," she added. "We
should probably be doing double what we are doing now."</TE>
<TE>   Mangis said Food Share's resources are limited: "We are maxed
out."</TE>
<TE>   This holiday season, The Times is highlighting programs and
organizations that serve needy youths and families in Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties as part of its
effort to raise money for worthy causes. Food Share received $15,000
from the Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign was established in 2000 and is run by the Los Angeles
Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune Foundation. The
foundation will match the first $700,000 raised at 50 cents on the
dollar. The foundation and The Times will absorb all administrative
costs.</TE>

<HD>2 Vie for Bully Pulpit as State Superintendent of Schools</HD>
<DH>Katherine Smith and Jack O'Connell compete for a post that
could be marginalized under a reorganization plan afoot in
Sacramento.</DH>

<LD>If there is anything Katherine H. Smith and Jack O'Connell agree on,
it's the job they both want: California superintendent of public
instruction.</LD>
<LD>   Smith is a Republican school board president from Anaheim, a
self-styled Sacramento outsider who talks about the need to restore
civility to schools.</LD>
<LD>   O'Connell is a Democratic state senator from San Luis Obispo who
wants to expand popular class-size reforms into higher grades. A law
he wrote six years ago puts a limit of 20 students per class in
kindergarten through third grade.</LD>
<TE>   The two are vying to replace Supt. Delaine Eastin, who must leave
office because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   The superintendent oversees the 1,600-member Department of
Education but has little real authority to define policies, which are
set by the State Board of Education.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the superintendent vies for visibility with the
secretary for education, who is appointed by and represents the
governor on education matters.</TE>
<TE>   The existence of the two positions and the state board confuses
many educators, who say they receive guidance from all of them.</TE>
<TE>   The elected position could be marginalized by a new proposal in
Sacramento to place many of the superintendent's responsibilities --
and most of the staff -- directly under the governor's secretary for
education.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the two candidates say they want the job because it
provides a bully pulpit to advocate for the state's 6 million public
school students.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm passionate about improving public education," said O'Connell,
51, who is being forced from his current Senate seat, also by term
limits.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell wrote laws to create the state's new high school exit
exam and raise salaries for beginning teachers. He also spearheaded a
successful effort two years ago to reduce the vote threshold for
local school bonds from 66% to 55%. That state initiative has enabled
many school districts to raise money for new campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-year veteran of the Legislature has raised $6 million and
enjoys wide backing from many of the state's unions. The California
Teachers Assn. and the California Federation of Teachers -- the
state's two teachers unions -- together have given O'Connell more
than $370,000.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell also has received large donations from prominent
individuals, including $100,000 from philanthropist Eli Broad and
$250,000 from Reed Hastings, president of the State Board of
Education.</TE>
<TE>   As superintendent, O'Connell says, he would focus attention on
struggling schools that are at risk of state takeover. "I think I'm
really primed for this position," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, president of the Anaheim Union High School District, says
she would lobby to expand vocational education and will call on
teachers to further embrace the basics in the elementary grades, such
as phonics, grammar and rote math instruction.</TE>
<TE>   She talks about her successful effort to introduce a moment of
silence each morning into Anaheim's secondary schools -- not meant
for prayer but to give students time to collect their thoughts -- and
to help bring uniforms to the junior high schools of Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has raised $138,000 for her campaign so far. She and her
husband, Clarke, loaned her campaign $60,000. The rest has come in
smaller contributions from numerous friends and supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack O'Connell is a politician. I am not," said Smith, 61. "I am
a citizen who is committed to change. If I can leave this [job]
better than when I found it, then it will have been worth it to me."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the candidates have accused each other of
misrepresenting their own qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Smith said O'Connell misled voters by adding
"teacher" to his ballot designation even though he had not taught
full-time in two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack has not been in the trenches for 20 years. He's been in the
halls of Sacramento talking to legislators," Smith said. "They're all
out of touch with what we're dealing with in our school systems."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell, who has a teaching credential, taught high school
full-time in Oxnard from 1975 to 1980. He most recently taught an
adult education class last summer in Sacramento, he says, to
reconnect to the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell said he added "teacher" to his ballot designation to
more accurately reflect his background.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, O'Connell has questioned Smith's public claim of being
a teacher, although she identifies herself on the ballot only as a
governing board member of the Anaheim district.</TE>
<TE>   But in interviews and in her campaign biography, Smith says she
worked in 1964 as a private school teacher in Anaheim and as an
elementary school substitute teacher in Anaheim in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Smith does not have a teaching credential and acknowledges she
never received her bachelor's degree at Cal State Hayward.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes down to it, we're all teachers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the candidates' backgrounds may be less important than
their abilities to build bridges in Sacramento. The state
superintendent must work closely with the State Board of Education,
the Legislature, the secretary for education and the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Eastin, the current superintendent, has had a frosty relationship
with Gov. Gray Davis, and the governor, declaring education his top
priority, has often overshadowed her in public debate and in the
media.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Mayor's Deal Is Probed</HD>
<DH>O.C. Grand Jury hears testimony by five city officials in
$1.8-million land sale he brokered.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Beach's top city leaders testified Wednesday before a grand
jury convened by the Orange County district attorney's office to
investigate Mayor Wayne Baglin's role as a real estate agent in the
$1.8-million sale of two properties to the city for a senior center.</LD>
<LD>   City Manager Kenneth C. Frank, City Atty. Philip Kohn and three
council members were among the witnesses led one by one to a closed
grand jury room at the county's main courthouse in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, some acknowledged they had been subpoenaed to testify
but declined to comment, saying they were sworn to secrecy.</LD>
<TE>   Baglin said Wednesday that he was not called to testify and
strongly denied that he did anything improper in the real estate
transaction last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I had freely talked about this during the last year and
voluntarily met with the district attorney's office to go over the
details," Baglin said. "At this point my attorney advised me it would
be unwise to discuss the issue any further."</TE>
<TE>   His Newport Beach attorney, Michael Molfetta, said his client is
innocent and "looks forward to this whole thing being put to rest."</TE>
<TE>   The case dates from January 2001, when the City Council voted to
buy a pair of adjacent parcels on 3rd Street through eminent domain.
The city wanted to use the downtown land for a long-awaited senior
center.</TE>
<TE>   The property was owned by Baglin's clients and longtime friends,
Edgar and Dorothy Hatfield. Baglin represented the couple during
negotiations with the city. And within days, and without the need for
eminent domain, the two parties agreed on the price. Baglin earned a
$54,000 commission.</TE>
<TE>   Baglin, then a councilman, recused himself from the city's vote to
buy the land and disclosed his relationship with the sellers. Still,
the sale remains an issue in Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have argued that a conflict of interest existed because
Baglin relinquished his role as a councilman in favor of his clients.
The higher the price he was able to broker, the higher the cost for
taxpayers and the higher his commission, they argue.</TE>
<TE>   Molfetta said that Baglin has always been open about being a real
estate agent and that he is allowed to earn a living. He also pointed
out that the commission Baglin earned was below the going rate in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "First and foremost, this isn't one of those things that came to
light after the fact," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no impropriety," he added. "When we have our day in
court, it will be proven that Mr. Baglin has not run afoul of any
law. In fact, he is innocent of any wrongdoing."</TE>
<TE>   But Fred Smoller, political science chairman at Chapman University
in Orange, said the deal raises concerns.</TE>
<TE>   He said council members should never represent anyone with
business before the council if they have a financial interest in the
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the better job he does for the client, the better off
he does at the public's expense," Smoller said.</TE>
<TE>   Molfetta said the grand jury is trying to determine whether Baglin
violated government code section 1090, which prohibits elected
officials from being financially interested in any contract made by
them in their official capacity, or by any body or board of which
they are members. The violation is a felony, punishable by a fine of
up to $1,000 or by imprisonment. Those found guilty can also be
banned forever from holding office in California.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors declined to comment on the case or say when the grand
jury will complete its work.</TE>
<TE>   Baglin was first elected to the council in 1978 and lost his seat
in 1998. He was elected in 2000 and is in the middle of a four-year
term.</TE>

<HD>Living Wage Issue Put in Voters' Laps</HD>
<DH>The measure on the Santa Monica ballot will culminate a
years-long battle over mandating a base pay for workers in the city's
tourism zone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Groves</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With three sons and her mother to care for, Flora Andrade finds that
her wages as a Santa Monica hotel housekeeper run out long before her
family's needs do.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't pay for my rent, my bills, my food," she said. "It's just
too little."</LD>
<LD>   That is why the Guatemala-born Andrade, 41, is risking the ire of
her employer, the Doubletree Guest Suites, to speak out for Measure
JJ, a referendum on Tuesday's ballot that would enact a "living wage"
for thousands of workers in the city's coastal and downtown tourism
zone.</LD>
<TE>   Since Baltimore passed the nation's first "living wage" law in
1994, more than 90 cities or counties, including Los Angeles and San
Francisco, have adopted laws boosting the pay of the working poor.
Until now, the ordinances have covered companies that have contracts
with or get direct economic aid from cities.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica's ordinance goes a step beyond. It would be the first
to establish a wage floor for private employers of hotel maids, food
servers and retail clerks, on the grounds that the businesses benefit
from public investments.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, it is being closely watched nationwide by labor
activists who view a victory as a way to propel their movement -- and
by business owners who say such measures could distort wages and
erode profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   "This ordinance definitely pushes the envelope," said Madeline
Janis-Aparicio, executive director of the Los Angeles Alliance for a
New Economy, a coalition that helped enact Los Angeles' living wage
in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica ordinance would require employers in the tony
coastal zone and downtown to pay $10.50 an hour with health-care
benefits, or $12.25 an hour without. The rates would be adjusted
annually for inflation. Businesses with more than $5 million in gross
annual sales for each of the last two years would qualify. The sales
figure also would be adjusted each year.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council passed the ordinance last year. But before it
went into effect, a hotel coalition succeeded in putting the issue
before the voters.</TE>
<TE>   Taking Sides</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, Santa Monica's nearly 56,000 registered voters have
been deluged with campaign mailers, phone calls and precinct walkers
urging them to vote for or against. Both sides are accusing the other
of misleading arguments and dirty tricks.</TE>
<TE>   The high-stakes squabble is rooted in the city's decision two
decades ago to encourage the development of tourism rather than big
office buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The city rezoned the area along and near Ocean Avenue, luring a
number of hotels, many owned by multibillion-dollar corporations,
such as Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide and Loews Hotels. It also
spent millions of dollars to develop the pier, the beachfront and the
Third Street Promenade.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the Miramar Sheraton, the city's only unionized hotel,
launched a union-busting drive, a move that clashed with the city's
famously liberal sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Monicans began to realize that this was an industry built
on the backs of hundreds of low-wage workers," said Vivian Rothstein,
a union organizer who directs Santa Monicans Allied for Responsible
Tourism, or SMART, an organization of community activists, clergy and
others.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the group proposed a living wage ordinance. Months later,
a hotel-backed group calling itself Santa Monicans for a Living Wage
countered with its own petition.</TE>
<TE>   Known as Measure KK, it was derided by SMART as a "phony living
wage initiative" that would cover just 62 people and prohibit the
City Council from enacting the kind of measure SMART proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Measure KK made it onto the 2000 ballot but was trounced, 78% to
22%, even though the hotel group spent more than $1 million to drum
up support and to unseat council incumbents who favored SMART's
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a city-commissioned study found that the typical
low-wage worker in Santa Monica had a family income of $20,000 to
$26,000, no health insurance and a costly 1 1/2-hour commute. The
report projected that the typical family's after-tax income would
rise by 13% to 20% under the SMART ordinance. The conclusion: The
hotels could afford the living wage.</TE>
<TE>   Referendum Campaign</TE>
<TE>   In July 2001, the council passed the SMART ordinance. The next
day, a coalition of hotels and other businesses began a campaign to
place a referendum on the ballot. The result was Measure JJ.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say the measure is aimed primarily at large employers
in the tourism zone, particularly a dozen or so luxury hotels --
including Shutters on the Beach, Casa del Mar and Le Merigot -- and
retailers such as Macy's and Robinsons-May. Many workers in the zone
earn $6.75 an hour, the state's minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   But several of the city's hottest restaurants say they will also
be caught up in a living-wage web. Some, such as P.F. Chang's China
Bistro, have threatened to eliminate their lunch or sidewalk trade --
laying off workers in the process -- to push sales below $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in favor of everybody getting a fair living wage, but it's
got to be equal throughout the area," said Marvin Zeidler, co-owner
of the Broadway Deli on the Third Street Promenade. "If it's for the
United States, fine. If it's for California, fine. But to single out
two or three blocks in Santa Monica and indicate [minimum wages] will
be double the normal is unfair."</TE>
<TE>   More than half of Zeidler's 170 employees would qualify for the
living wage. "If we had to pay the money required, we'd effectively
be out of business," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Living wage advocates counter that the ordinance would allow
"hardship" exemptions, but the criteria have not been established.</TE>
<TE>   Economists differ wildly on Measure JJ's effects. The city study
concluded that 2,000 workers at 47 businesses would be covered,
whereas a hotel-sponsored report projected more than 4,000 employees
at 100 businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Santa Monica, already mired in a budget crisis, would
not be immune. Estimates suggest it would have to increase wages to
city workers by $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Certain to qualify would be two luxe hotels -- Shutters and Casa
del Mar -- owned by Edward Thomas Cos., based in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   But the company's president, Timothy S. Dubois, said all of the
company's 375 hourly workers who do not receive tips already make
more than the proposed minimum wage and have for the last two years.
The hotels' starting wage, he said, is $10.82 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Against Unionization</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the company has contributed $875,000 over the last three
years to fight the living wage. Why? Because Dubois sees the
ordinance as a thinly veiled attempt to force the hotels to unionize,
something he fiercely opposes.</TE>
<TE>   He shows off rooms at Shutters, many of which feature peek-a-boo
windows that allow ocean views for guests soaking in bathtubs.</TE>
<TE>   Each room or suite also comes equipped with a snorkel-sporting
rubber duck or other bath toy. The rooms bring $350 to $2,000 a
night.</TE>
<TE>   The lower rate is about what housekeeper Andrade pays each month
for her government-subsidized apartment in a graffiti-scarred

<HD>Year of Searching Ends in Grief</HD>
<DH>Man's body lies forgotten in a Hawthorne hospital morgue as
family members desperately look for him.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For 333 days, the body of Armando Chapal Ramirez lay forgotten and
decaying in the morgue at Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in
Hawthorne while his family searched for him.</LD>
<LD>   Ramirez's father said he had taken a photograph of his 21-year-old
son to the hospital, two miles from the family home, in the days
after his son's disappearance.</LD>
<LD>   No, he was told, your son is not here.</LD>
<TE>   But Armando Ramirez, identified as John Doe, was in the hospital's
intensive-care unit after paramedics had found him wandering near the
Century Freeway, high on cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials said they could not identify the young man at
the time. Ramirez, however, had his last name tattooed on the back of
his neck.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven months later, the body of Ramirez was discovered in the
hospital morgue and turned over to the coroner's office. It took
investigators five weeks to identify the decomposed body, which had
been kept at 40 degrees but not embalmed.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 24, more than a year after Ramirez disappeared, his family
was told of his death. The body was in such a state of decomposition
that the family was not allowed to view it.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital "had him there the whole time down there. Meanwhile,
we were suffering day and night, waiting for the worst," said
Ramirez's father, Jesus, 45, a stock clerk in Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez "didn't have an ID; he didn't have anything. But he had a
name. He had a family. He had been to that hospital before," said
Ramirez's mother, Luz Elena, 45, a housekeeper at a Culver City
hotel. "So what happened?"</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials told family members that the attending
physician left on maternity leave around the time Ramirez died. When
the doctor returned, she found that his body had never left the
morgue.</TE>
<TE>   A hospital spokeswoman told The Times that the facility is unable
to explain how Ramirez's body was overlooked for so long.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the process of investigating," said Carla Singleton
Turner.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Shaffer, an attorney for the Ramirez family, said the
hospital had violated a state law that requires medical facilities to
transfer bodies to the coroner's office after any unusual death,
including one involving drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the height of incompetence and neglect," Shaffer said.</TE>
<TE>   A Father at 16</TE>
<TE>   Armando Ramirez dropped out of Hawthorne High School in the 10th
grade.</TE>
<TE>   At age 16, he became a father and named his son Daniel.</TE>
<TE>   He joined a gang and had the name of the group tattooed on his
back -- a secret he kept from his family for several years. He had
the name of his son's mother, Veronica, tattooed on his right leg.</TE>
<TE>   When he and the boy's mother separated, he remained close to his
son, family members said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez taught Danny to play soccer, a sport Ramirez had played at
Lennox Middle School. He doted on the boy, now 5, helping him learn
the alphabet, the names of colors, how to write his name, family
members said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez's parents and his three sisters hoped the boy would be the
push Ramirez needed to stop smoking crack cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez would go on a cocaine binge for two or three days every
month or so, his father said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez would usually call one of his sisters during his binges
and ask them to tell their mother not to worry. And though he would
return home exhausted, Ramirez remained robust in appearance and
health, his family said.</TE>
<TE>   Coping with their son's addiction was never easy. Ramirez
occasionally snapped at them and brooded. Although he was well-known
in the neighborhood, he had few friends, spending most of his time
with his son, who lived with Ramirez and his parents.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried so hard to change him, to teach him how to be a better
man," his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 30, 2001, the Ramirez family gathered in the backyard of
their Hawthorne home for a barbecue. Ramirez and his father cooked.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime after midnight, Ramirez slipped out of the house. When
his family realized he was gone, they waited for his usual phone
call. It never came.</TE>
<TE>   His parents began driving around the neighborhood, inquiring at
several area hospitals. For a year, they said, they jumped every time
the phone rang. Danny Ramirez would ask, "Where's my daddy?" He was
told that no one knew. The boy would shrug and say, "I know he's
coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Ramirez filed a missing-person report with police. He said
he was haunted by his son's absence. "He was always with me, all the
time," Jesus Ramirez said.</TE>
<TE>   The parents, along with other relatives, spent nearly a year
looking for Ramirez in the Hawthorne area, thinking he was
disoriented and lost. Each day, they slowly drove the streets where
Ramirez used to hang out. They asked store owners, friends and
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't see him. No one saw him -- nothing," Luz Elena Ramirez
said. "And we just kept looking for him, and still nothing. No one
had seen him."</TE>
<TE>   Arrives at Hospital</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 1, 2001, paramedics brought Armando Ramirez to the
emergency room at Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center. He had been
spotted wandering near the Crenshaw Boulevard onramp of the Century
Freeway. Bystanders had pulled him from the street.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics described Ramirez as agitated but alert, according to
one report. Initially, they thought his name was Fernando Martinez.
It is unknown whether Ramirez might have given a name other than his
own, or whether paramedics misunderstood him.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez was described as combative when he was admitted to the
hospital. He had a temperature of 106 degrees, which is not uncommon
for a person under the influence of cocaine and who had been
physically active, one medical expert said. Drug tests showed he had
consumed marijuana and cocaine. He had pneumonia in one lung,
according to his medical report.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Ramirez was transferred to intensive care. His
condition continued to deteriorate, according to a report. He
suffered kidney and liver failure. On Oct. 6, he was put on a medical
ventilator and a dialysis machine.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez died at 9:33 p.m. on Oct. 9, 2001. His body was moved to
the hospital morgue.</TE>
<TE>   "Therein the mystery begins," said Craig Harvey, chief
investigator for the coroner's office. "We don't know why he wasn't
reported to the coroners. Standard operating procedure is that you
call a law enforcement agency and ask them to take a death report,
which generates a report to the coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   "That was apparently not done."</TE>
<TE>   The coroner listed the cause of death as related to cocaine abuse.</TE>
<TE>   One Last Look</TE>
<TE>   The night before the family finally got the news from the
coroner's office, Luz Elena Ramirez had driven around the
neighborhood one more time, looking for her son. She used to tell her
husband that she thought something awful had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Ramirez wouldn't hear such talk. Too negative, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyday we expected a call, something from him, anything. But we
got nothing," the mother said.</TE>
<TE>   When the call finally came from the coroner's investigator, Luz
Elena Ramirez at first thought her son had died recently. Then she
learned what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great horror," she said, weeping. "I'd never expect that
a hospital would just keep a young man all alone like that."</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez will be buried today.</TE>

<HD>Pine Grove Faces Limits on Patient Care</HD>
<DH>In response to sexual assaults at the West Hills
psychiatric hospital, county plans to halt involuntary admissions to
the facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing poor supervision at a West Hills psychiatric hospital where
two teenage patients were assaulted, the Los Angeles County
Department of Mental Health is planning to strip the private facility
of its ability to treat some patients, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Under such a mandate, Pine Grove Hospital would lose its ability
to detain and treat mentally ill patients admitted involuntarily,
said David Meyer, the agency's chief deputy director. This could
deprive the hospital of a significant portion of its Medi-Cal
funding, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "This is very, very severe business," Meyer said. "We don't
undertake these things lightly. We only do it when we think the
situation requires vigorous action."</LD>
<TE>   Pine Grove administrators will have 30 days to respond to the
findings, which could lead to a less-severe ruling or a complete
reversal of the county's decision, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry McFarland, the administrator of the 80-bed hospital, could
not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement authorities have investigated five reported
incidents of sexual molestation in the last three years involving
Pine Grove patients and former patients. One incident took place away
from the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Two former employees and a 17-year-old patient have since been
convicted of sexually assaulting teenage girls they met at the
hospital. Two other former employees were investigated for separate
molestation allegations but were not prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   In concluding its own investigation of the hospital last week, the
county Mental Health Department found "a pattern of shortcomings with
respect to quality of care, especially with respect to the young
people" at the hospital, Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer said the decision to limit patient care at the hospital was
based on the molestation incidents and "a variety of other complaints
that we received from families and parents."</TE>
<TE>   The county's actions will not take effect until after the appeal
process, but the agency began sending patients' rights advocates to
the hospital this week for daily monitoring visits.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Health Services conducted an on-site
investigation of Pine Grove last week to determine if it is fit to
receive federal welfare funds. The department will release the
results of its probe in November, spokeswoman Norma Arceo said.</TE>
<TE>   The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
also has opened an inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   All four victims in the reported incidents at the hospital were
underage girls, according to hospital documents and police records.
The most recent occurred Aug. 13, when a 17-year-old boy raped a
13-year-old fellow patient in her hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   This year, two hospitals -- Hollywood Community Hospital of Van
Nuys and City of Angels Medical Center-Ingleside -- have been
stripped of their ability to detain patients without their consent by
the Mental Health Department. Officials alleged the hospitals
released patients to unlicensed and unsafe boardinghouses.</TE>

<LD>The Santa Ana Planning Commission voted 5 to 1 this week to deny a
swap meet mall a variance that would have allowed it to stay open.</LD>
<LD>   The mall had operated for several years; its owner says its use
was shown in plans filed when it opened. The city says first objected
two years ago during a code enforcement program.</LD>
<LD>   Commission member Chris Leo opposed the denial. Wayne Avrashow,
attorney for owner Dale Lee, said Lee will appeal the decision to the

<LD>A former Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. investment banker has settled
allegations over his role in the firm's alleged failure to disclose
the risks of investments related to Orange County's 1994 bankruptcy,
U.S. regulators said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth Ough of Post Falls, Idaho, settled the charges by agreeing
not to violate applicable provisions of securities law. He paid no
monetary fine or penalty, the Securities and Exchange Commission
said. He did not admit or deny guilt.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement comes more than two months after the firm, which is
now RBC Dain Rauscher, agreed to pay $500,000 to settle SEC
allegations that it did not tell investors that $680 million raised
from six other municipalities in 1993 and 1994 would go into the
faltering Orange County investment pool.</LD>

<HD>Among Honorary Officials in Hollywood, Is Mudslinging Also
Honorary?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ihate all the last-minute mudslinging in political campaigns. And
there's a lot of it going on in Hollywood, where secession proponent
Douglas Carlton has accused honorary mayor Johnny Grant of living in
Toluca Lake (a shocking thing to say about anyone) instead of
Tinseltown.</LD>
<LD>   In a press release, Carlton declared himself the new honorary
mayor, explaining he had unilaterally impeached Grant, who is opposed
to cityhood for Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The odd thing -- well, one of the odd things -- about Carlton's
announcement is that he represents a preservation group called Keep
Old Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   An L.A. that lost Hollywood would, of course, be a New Los
Angeles. Johnny went Hollywood a long time ago: As for Grant, he
actually lives in the penthouse suite of the Roosevelt Hotel on good
old Hollywood Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   And there's no requirement for the honorary mayor to live in
Hollywood except on an honorary basis. Grant, however, is so visible
in the community that "people think he is the real mayor," said Leron
Gubler, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce boss.</TE>
<TE>   "They see him walking down the street and they'll come up to him
and complain about things like potholes. And Johnny will tell them
who they have to get ahold of. I'm sure if Mr. Carlton would like to
take care of those problems, Johnny would make him a Special
Ambassador of Potholes."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that kind of body shop: Michael Kersey of Corona came
upon an auto garage with a wraparound banner that could be
misinterpreted (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayer dollars at work: John Greenwood of Beverly Hills,
meanwhile, noticed a no-selling sign that was being used by a cheeky
offramp entrepreneur to prop up his goods (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   A welcome relief for computer users: Are you an e-mail recipient
being driven crazy by spam? Ted Creveling of Valinda found an inn
that will give you relief (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, ladies: An offer that would no doubt be snapped up by
countless wives was sent my way by John Brossart of Cerritos (see
accompanying). But he added that it was placed in 1982 and he just
came across it, so it's only of historical value now.</TE>
<TE>   Mystery solved: In Wednesday's column, I said I was mystified by a
South African billboard that displayed a "Rainbow" logo and a caption
that said, "No hooting please. Chickens resting."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Fine of Tustin, who grew up in that country, writes: "In
South Africa, a car's horn is called a 'hooter.' Rainbow is a massive
chicken producer, like Foster Farms, and the billboard implies that
their chickens need some peace."</TE>
<TE>   Treating a disobedient car, no doubt: The police log of the Los
Alamitos News-Enterprise reported that "a man was seen hitting the
dashboard of his car with a wooden baton." I hope he didn't wake up
any chickens.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: Fans of Bill Keene, KNX radio's late traffic/weather
reporter, will recall this was the day he would give the temperatures
in such scary locales as Maliboo, Hacienda Frights, Ghosta Mesa, Bell
Goblins, Woodland Chills, Aghoula, Spookamonga, Santa Scarita, West
Munster and, of course, multi-governed Hollyweird. Happy Halloween.</TE>

<LD>A jury convicted a former taxicab driver Wednesday of voluntary
manslaughter for shooting another cabbie to death after what
authorities say began as a murder-suicide pact.</LD>
<LD>   Chae Jung Han, 56, faces up to 12 years in prison when he is
sentenced Jan. 31.</LD>
<LD>   Han, 56, David Keum Yung Ji, 55, and Hyang Baek, 55, all
cabdrivers from Garden Grove, drove around Orange County in Ji's cab
on April 26, 2000. They were drinking soju, similar to vodka,
discussing their financial troubles and contemplating suicide, a
prosecutor said.</LD>
<TE>   Han parked at the Newport Beach Pier parking lot, where they had
planned to carry out their pact, prosecutors said. He shot Baek in
the head with Baek's .38-caliber revolver. Then Ji, who apparently
had changed his mind about dying, struggled for the gun and handed it
to police when they arrived.</TE>

<LD>The Orange County Water District will receive $9 million from the
Army Corps of Engineers to help an endangered bird's recovery and
also eradicate a fast-growing, bamboo-like invader that drinks up
thousands of gallons of potable water a year.</LD>
<LD>   The money is part of an effort to offset the impact of raising the
height of the Prado Dam, which is near Corona in Riverside County.
The corps built and operates the flood-control project.</LD>
<LD>   The dam is expected to be raised 28 feet, greatly expanding the
Prado flood basin. Construction could start by January.</LD>
<TE>   Part of the funds will help wildlife management for the least
Bell's vireo, an endangered California songbird in the project area.</TE>
<TE>   The money will be paid over a seven-year period and also fund
eradication of Arundo donax, an invasive, non-native reed that can
grow two inches a day. It thrives in parts of Southern California,
choking out native plants.</TE>
<TE>   The money will also help pay for habitat restoration, public
education and recreational management, an Orange County Water

<HD>Ryder Gave 2 Stories to Store Guards, Court Told</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moments after Winona Ryder was apprehended with more than $5,500 in
unpaid merchandise outside Saks Fifth Avenue, she calmly asked
security guards, "Didn't my assistant pay for it?" according to
testimony Wednesday in the actress' ongoing shoplifting trial.</LD>
<LD>   Saks security investigator Colleen Rainey told jurors in a Beverly
Hills courtroom that Ryder gave guards two different explanations
about why she left the posh department store with the designer
clothes and accessories. The second reason, Rainey said, was a claim
by Ryder that she was preparing for roles in two future films: "White
Jazz" and "Shopgirl."</LD>
<LD>   Ryder's publicist, Mara Buxbaum, said outside court later that
Ryder did talk about possible future projects while she was in the
security room. But any claim that the actress said she was
shoplifting for those films was "utterly ridiculous," the publicist
said.</LD>
<TE>   Rainey's boss, security manager Kenneth Evans, also testified
earlier this week that Ryder said she took the clothes as research
for a film role. Evans finished his testimony Wednesday after
spending much of three days on the stand narrating surveillance
videotapes showing Ryder's December shopping spree. The tape never
showed an assistant with Ryder.</TE>
<TE>   Rainey, due to be cross-examined by defense attorney Mark Geragos
today, said Ryder was calm and relaxed as she was questioned by
security guards. Rainey, who has since left Saks, identified about 20
items that she said Ryder never paid for, including a $760 Marc
Jacobs thermal top, a $540 Natori handbag, a $225 Eric Javits hat and
an $80 pair of Donna Karan socks.</TE>
<TE>   During her testimony, Rainey told jurors that while Ryder was in a
dressing room, she grabbed scissors from her purse and cut sensor
tags off two expensive handbags. The guard said she witnessed Ryder
through slats in the dressing room door.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder tried to cut tags off two other purses, Rainey said, but was
stymied by the plastic security devices. Before leaving the dressing
room, the actress concealed socks and hair bands in tissue paper and
stuffed all of the items in a shopping bag, the guard testified.</TE>
<TE>   During his cross-examination earlier in the day, security manager
Evans told jurors that he did not have personal feelings, one way or
the other, about the Oscar-nominated actress. Defense attorney
Geragos then asked Evans about a lunch he had with a former co-worker
and asked Evans if he had said, "I'm gonna nail her" and "I'm gonna
get her one way or another."</TE>
<TE>   Evans acknowledged having the lunch but denied making such
statements. Geragos said later that he would probably call the
co-worker to the stand in Ryder's defense.</TE>
<TE>   During one section of the video presented Wednesday, Evans pointed
out Ryder reaching into her own pocket and putting something in a
pocket of a coat on a rack in the Gucci area. Evans said that coat
was not there later when he went to look for sensor tags.</TE>
<TE>   Evans also reiterated that he had found four tags, which matched
merchandise Ryder was found with, in a jacket pocket in the Chanel
boutique.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos accused Evans of making up that testimony, pointing out
that it was not mentioned in any report.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder is charged with grand theft, burglary and vandalism and
could be sentenced to three years in state prison if convicted.
Geragos, however, insists that Ryder was set up and didn't shoplift
anything. She bought about $3,700 in merchandise from the posh
department store on Dec. 12, the day of the arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, who turned 31 on Tuesday, took notes as she listened to the
testimony. Appearing frustrated at points, Ryder shook her head and
took deep breaths. Her parents, along with her publicist and several
friends, filled a portion of the Beverly Hills courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   A Saks sales associate, Shirley Warren, testified Wednesday that
Ryder appeared to cut her finger while she was in the second-floor
dressing room and that she helped the actress put on a bandage. "She
just appeared to be a little nervous," Warren told jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Another sales associate, Sophie Seyranian, testified that Ryder
asked to be placed in a specific dressing room on the third floor.
"She preferred to have some privacy," said Seyranian, who helped
Ryder purchase a brown jacket and two blouses.</TE>
<TE>   Both sales associates said Ryder did not leave a credit card
imprint or tell them to leave her account open. Seyranian said Ryder
did not give her any other items to purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox also announced that he would
hold a hearing this afternoon in response to an appellate court
ruling questioning his decision to seal several pretrial motions and
hold closed hearings.</TE>
<TE>   The film projects referred to Wednesday by former security guard
Rainey are based on a James Ellroy novel and a Steve Martin novella.
Neither film has yet been produced, although "Shopgirl," about a
salesgirl at Neiman-Marcus, is due to be filmed early next year with
a cast that does not include Ryder.*</TE>

<HD>Defendant Testifies in Woman's Fatal Fall From Balcony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A businessman testified Wednesday that his lover, a subordinate in
the company where he was vice president, fell accidentally to her
death from a hotel's eighth-floor balcony where they were making
love.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Lee Salazar, 39, also testified that he did not call police
and made inconsistent statements to investigators the following day
because he was afraid to lose his wife and executive job if their
affair was discovered.</LD>
<LD>   Salazar -- vice president of Houston-based Skillmaster Staffing
Services at the time of the death -- made the statements while on the
stand in Pomona Superior Court, where he is accused of killing Sandra
Orellana, 27. Orellana worked in the company's workers' compensation
department.</LD>
<TE>   "I was scared that if I called they weren't going to believe me
because I was drunk," he said. "I was worried about my wife, kids and
my family -- they would leave me."</TE>
<TE>   Michael R. Coghlan, his defense attorney, walked the jury through
the events of Nov. 12 and 13, 1996, portraying them through the eyes
of Salazar.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar and Orellana arrived in Los Angeles to get acquainted with
a subsidiary that Skillmaster had just purchased. The two checked
into separate rooms at the Industry Hills Sheraton.</TE>
<TE>   After a day of work, Salazar, Orellana and a representative of the
subsidiary had dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar and Orellana spent the rest of the night drinking and
dancing at the hotel bar, and Salazar testified that the two began
kissing.</TE>
<TE>   According to Salazar, the duo, intoxicated, went to the eighth
floor, where Orellana pulled him into her bedroom, and she took off
her clothes.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Salazar said, she went to the balcony, wearing just
a top. Salazar, also partially dressed, followed, and they kept
making love.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar said Orellana was facing the railing, and he was standing
behind her when she said, "hold on," and began to face him.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Salazar testified, she began to turn, lifted her leg and
hopped to sit on the railing and fell to her death.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one motion," he said, adding that he had no chance to help
her.</TE>
<TE>   He grabbed some of his clothes and went next door to his room,
where he pretended for several hours that he did not know what had
happened.</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz tried to
get Salazar to reveal facts and poked holes in his story to support
the prosecution's theory: that Salazar got Orellana drunk, had sex
with her and, at the last minute, was afraid that he would lose
everything if she revealed their affair.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Foltz got Salazar to admit that, with a
bachelor's degree in business management, Salazar was familiar with
sexual harassment laws.</TE>
<TE>   Foltz pointed out that just two weeks earlier, Salazar had become
third in command in the company and had helped write the sexual
harassment policy that prohibited sex between a supervisor and
subordinate.</TE>
<TE>   The killing occurred, Foltz suggested, when Salazar realized
Orellana could pose a danger to him.</TE>
<TE>   "If Sandra Orellana had survived that night," Foltz said, "she
could have ratted to anyone on the planet: He got me drunk and had
sex with me."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar dismissed that suggestion saying, "If we had been thinking
that far ahead, we would not have been doing that."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar is expected to return to the stand today.</TE>

<LD>Mexican drug cartels, attracted by the state's rich soil and remote
forests, grew nearly three-quarters of the pot seized in California
this fall, state officials announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   That marks a dangerous shift toward large and sophisticated
growing operations, said Sonya Barna, commander of the Department of
Justice's Campaign Against Marijuana Production.</LD>
<LD>   "It used to be an industry controlled by hippies with small
gardens," Barna said. "Now, it's not uncommon to see cartels planting
anywhere from 2,000 to 10,000 plants in a garden."</LD>

<HD>Valley Mayoral Candidates Offer Proposals, Endorsements</HD>
<DH>One contender suggests deporting illegal immigrants
suspected of minor crimes. Another gets a little help from his
elected friends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Fox and Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Candidates hoping to become mayor of a San Fernando Valley city
stepped up their campaigning Wednesday with a flurry of new proposals
and endorsements, including a hotly debated plan by one contender to
deport illegal immigrants who commit minor crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Boyer, a candidate who sported a white cowboy hat (and a
black eye from a football game), said if elected he would urge police
to crack down on "illegal alien criminals," even those caught tagging
a wall with graffiti. "Instead of arresting the same guy 10 times and
letting him go, let's get him out of the country," Boyer, an alarm
company manager, said at a news conference outside the Van Nuys
courthouse.</LD>
<LD>   Boyer took issue with a Los Angeles Police Department policy
adopted in 1979, known as Special Order 40, that prohibits officers
from questioning people just to determine their immigration status.</LD>
<TE>   The policy also bars officers from turning over to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service people accused of misdemeanors and other
minor violations, such as loitering. The police can notify the INS
when an illegal immigrant is booked on suspicion of committing
felonies or multiple misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   Boyer's proposal to water down Special Order 40 drew strong
opposition from other Valley mayoral candidates and civil
libertarians.</TE>
<TE>   "You are going to have individuals in the community who would be
afraid to approach the police," said candidate David Hernandez Jr.,
adding that Boyer's plan is "not realistic" because jails could not
accommodate every illegal immigrant stopped for minor violations.</TE>
<TE>   Mayoral hopeful Benny Bernal said Boyer was "going extremely too
far." Mayoral candidates Leonard Shapiro, Gregory Roberts and Marc
Strassman agreed, saying they would leave Special Order 40 in place.</TE>
<TE>   But mayoral candidate Henry Divina said he supports allowing
police to notify the INS on illegal immigrants charged with
misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   American Civil Liberties Union attorney Dan Tokaji said diluting
Special Order 40 would hinder crime-solving because witnesses who
face misdemeanor charges would be afraid to come forward with
information.</TE>
<TE>   At another Van Nuys news conference Wednesday, Assemblyman Keith
Richman (R-Northridge) announced that several lawmakers from Santa
Clarita and Simi Valley have endorsed his run for Valley mayor.
Richman represents both cities at the state level.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the privilege of seeing how these smaller cities work,"
Richman said. "There's a big difference between how city services are
provided in Los Angeles, Simi Valley and Santa Clarita."</TE>
<TE>   The comparison is somewhat strained, however, by the vast
difference in the size of the cities. Simi Valley has a population of
115,000 while Santa Clarita has 160,000. A new Valley city would have
1.35 million residents.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley council members Paul Miller and Steven Sojka joined
Simi Mayor Bill Davis in supporting Richman and Valley cityhood, as
did Santa Clarita Mayor Frank Ferry, Mayor Pro-Tem Cameron Smyth and
council members Robert Kellar and Laurene Weste.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Wilson, another Valley mayoral candidate, convened a news
conference Wednesday in Van Nuys to decry the influence of developers
on the secession debate.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession campaign has raked in more
than $5.5 million, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from
major developers such as Majestic Realty Co., Castle and Cook Inc.
and Beverly Hills Construction Management.</TE>
<TE>   "What are they going to get in return for giving money to defeat
Valley independence?" said Wilson, a Realtor. "When you can write a
check for $250,000 ... this far exceeds what we know is reasonable.
It really flies in the face of local control."</TE>

<HD>Valley Mayoral Hopefuls Cite Plans, Support</HD>
<DH>One contender suggests deporting illegal immigrants
suspected of minor crimes. Another gets a little help from his
elected friends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Fox and Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Candidates hoping to become mayor of a San Fernando Valley city
stepped up their campaigning Wednesday with a flurry of new proposals
and endorsements, including a hotly debated plan by one contender to
deport illegal immigrants who commit minor crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Boyer, a candidate who sported a white cowboy hat (and a
black eye from a football game), said if elected he would urge police
to crack down on "illegal alien criminals," even those caught tagging
a wall with graffiti.</LD>
<LD>   "Instead of arresting the same guy 10 times and letting him go,
let's get him out of the country," Boyer, an alarm company manager,
said at a news conference outside the Van Nuys courthouses.</LD>
<TE>   Boyer took issue with a Los Angeles Police Department policy
adopted in 1979, known as Special Order 40, that prohibits officers
from questioning people just to determine their immigration status.</TE>
<TE>   The policy also bars officers from turning over to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service people accused of misdemeanors and other
minor violations, such as loitering.</TE>
<TE>   The police can notify the INS when an illegal immigrant is booked
on suspicion of committing felonies or multiple misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   Boyer's proposal to water down Special Order 40 drew strong
opposition from other Valley mayoral candidates and civil
libertarians.</TE>
<TE>   "You are going to have individuals in the community who would be
afraid to approach the police," said candidate David Hernandez Jr.,
adding that Boyer's plan is "not realistic" because jails could not
accommodate every illegal immigrant stopped for minor violations.</TE>
<TE>   Mayoral hopeful Benny Bernal said Boyer was "going extremely too
far." Mayoral candidates Leonard Shapiro, Gregory Roberts and Marc
Strassman agreed, saying they would leave Special Order 40 in place.</TE>
<TE>   But mayoral candidate Henry Divina said he supports allowing
police to notify the INS on illegal immigrants charged with
misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   American Civil Liberties Union attorney Dan Tokaji said diluting
Special Order 40 would hinder crime-solving because witnesses who
face misdemeanor charges would be afraid to come forward with
information.</TE>
<TE>   At another Van Nuys news conference Wednesday, Assemblyman Keith
Richman (R-Northridge) announced that several lawmakers from Santa
Clarita and Simi Valley have endorsed his run for Valley mayor.
Richman represents both cities at the state level.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the privilege of seeing how these smaller cities work,"
Richman said. "There's a big difference between how city services are
provided in Los Angeles, Simi Valley and Santa Clarita."</TE>
<TE>   The comparison is somewhat strained, however, by the vast
difference in the size of the cities. Simi Valley has a population of
115,000 while Santa Clarita has 160,000 people. A new Valley city
would have 1.35 million residents.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Simi Valley's crime rate is the lowest among U.S.
cities with populations over 100,000, Simi Valley Mayor Bill Davis
recounted how his city incorporated decades ago to escape the same
sort of neglect Valley secessionists complain about today.</TE>
<TE>   "We were way out there on the eastern end of [Ventura] county, and
nobody seemed to care much about us or our services," he said. "Now,
our city speaks for itself."</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley council members Paul Miller and Steven Sojka joined
Davis in supporting Richman and Valley cityhood, as did Santa Clarita
Mayor Frank Ferry, Mayor Pro-Tem Cameron Smyth and council members
Robert Kellar and Laurene Weste.</TE>
<TE>   But secession has drawn opposition from officials in other nearby
cities, including San Fernando and Alhambra. Alhambra Mayor Mark R.
Paulson has expressed concern that a breakup could inflict "a serious
financial blow to our neighboring city [Los Angeles]."</TE>
<TE>   Mel Wilson, another Valley mayoral candidate, convened a news
conference Wednesday in Van Nuys to decry the influence of developers
on the secession debate.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession campaign has raked in more
than $5.5 million, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from
major developers such as Majestic Realty Co., Castle and Cook Inc.
and Beverly Hills Construction Management.</TE>
<TE>   "What are they going to get in return for giving money to defeat
Valley independence?" said Wilson, a Realtor.</TE>
<TE>   "When you can write a check for $250,000 ... this far exceeds what
we know is reasonable. It really flies in the face of local control."</TE>

<HD>City, County OK Funds to Settle Suits in Police Shootings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city and county of Los Angeles approved payments totaling more
than $1 million to settle lawsuits stemming from two separate police
shootings, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved
payment of $925,000 in the lawsuit of Grover Smith of Northridge, a
bystander shot in the leg nearly six years ago by officers with the
Los Angeles Police Department's elite Special Investigations Section,
who mistook him for a robbery suspect.</LD>
<LD>   Smith's attorney, Stephen Yagman, denied that the lawsuit is
settled, and called the allocation "wishful thinking" by the council
and city attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't respond to things the City Council does, and that
includes wishful thinking," Yagman said. "Mr. Smith's case is
scheduled for trial Nov. 12." He would not say if Smith still lives
in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors approved a settlement of $200,000
for the next-door neighbors of a Stevenson Ranch man killed in a
fiery, Aug. 31, 2001, gun battle with federal agents and sheriff's
deputies. The law enforcement officials were trying to serve a search
warrant on James Allen Beck, wanted on suspicion of impersonating a
U.S. marshal and possessing weapons. Beck barricaded himself in his
home and opened fire on the officers, killing Deputy Hagop "Jake"
Kuredjian.</TE>
<TE>   Under the settlement, the county will pay $167,500 to Phil and
Marilyn Lombardi, who were forced to hide in their bathroom with
their day-old daughter, Gianna, after sheriff's deputies mistook the
Lombardi house for Beck's, and fired more than 100 rounds into their
home.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Lombardi said the matter had been mediated a few months ago
and he and his wife were "glad to be putting it all behind them and
moving on."</TE>
<TE>   The county also approved payment of $32,500 to neighbor Steve
Rizzo and his 4-year-old daughter, Taylor, who waited trapped in
their home for several hours until authorities escorted them to
safety.</TE>

<HD>Fine for Sewage Spill Is Derided</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks city attorney will urge council to appeal,
saying water board's $200,000 reduction of $2.3-million penalty
'wasn't meaningful.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state water quality board has reduced its $2.3-million fine against
the city of Thousand Oaks by about $200,000 for a 1998 sewage spill,
but city lawyers say the amount defies a court order to reconsider
the hefty penalty.</LD>
<LD>   City Atty. Mark Sellers said he will recommend the City Council
appeal last week's decision by the state Regional Water Quality
Control Board, which levied the fine after a pipeline rupture sent 86
million gallons of sewage gushing into streams and the Pacific Ocean
during an El Nino storm.</LD>
<LD>   "The water board is saying, 'We don't care what natural disaster
occurs, you guys are paying for it,' " Sellers said. "Does that mean
the ratepayers of Thousand Oaks will have to pay for all the future
acts of God that occur?"</LD>
<TE>   The reduction was based on a ruling in December by Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs, who found that evidence
presented in court by the water quality board did not justify the
$2.3-million fine and ordered the agency to reconsider the sum.</TE>
<TE>   The city had appealed the original fine imposed by the board in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   The water board reviewed all the evidence at its Oct. 24 meeting,
taking into account Janavs' ruling and the city's ability to pay the
penalty, said Stephen Cain, a spokesman for the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "The board isn't interested in bankrupting Thousand Oaks," Cain
said. "This penalty was appropriate for the type and size of the
spillage. It was a very serious violation and the evidence shows it
could have been avoided. It would be unfair to all the cities dinged
by us for Thousand Oaks to get off the hook."</TE>
<TE>   The pipe failure came nearly two years after a city public works
study determined the three-mile pipeline that traverses a deep canyon
needed to be replaced and suggested homeowners be assessed an extra
$5.20 a month for repairs.</TE>
<TE>   But Sellers said that even if the city had voted for the fee
increase, the replacement would not have been completed before the
1998 flooding. The $20-million project required an environmental
impact report and the approval of various regulatory agencies,
including the state Department of Fish and Game, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council agreed to the repairs after the spill, and the
project was completed about six months ago, Sellers said.</TE>
<TE>   The rupture occurred at the height of a historic El Nino weather
pattern that pounded Southern California with storms for nearly a
month and overwhelmed the worn sewer line, which spilled its contents
into Conejo Creek.</TE>
<TE>   The contaminated water coursed through a creek in Camarillo and
farmland near Oxnard before dumping into the Pacific Ocean near Point
Mugu.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers said the board's small reduction fails to recognize the
spill was caused by a rare natural disaster over which the city had
no control.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't a meaningful reduction and it wasn't consistent with
the evidence," he said. "We showed that a wall of water that had
never been seen before in the recorded documentation of that creek
had occurred in that canyon."</TE>

<LD>Benjamin Lesko's dining room table, which is about 2 feet wide and 3
feet long, is not much of a dining room table, much less a
headquarters for a political campaign. Piled with folders, covered in
vinyl and overlooked by small maps and inspirational messages taped
to the wall above, it is nonetheless the nerve center of a quixotic
crusade for a city council seat that may never exist.</LD>
<LD>   The 48-year-old Lesko, a man broad of gesture and girth, is one of
eight candidates for the 10th district seat in the proposed San
Fernando Valley city. Los Angeles voters are being asked to carve the
new municipality from the existing city on election day Tuesday.
Given that polls indicate the secession measure may fail badly, Lesko
must be broad of spirit, too, to continue pressing his quest.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, it's a losing battle, a totally losing battle," he
acknowledges with a smile and a wave of his hand. "It goes back to my
experience getting sober and my religious experience -- you take all
the steps and leave the rest up to God. It's important to me that,
come Nov. 5, I leave nothing on the playing field. If it doesn't
work, at least the energy will continue. In the long run, I'll feel
better about myself and look better to my kids."</LD>
<TE>   It's impossible to generalize about the 121 men and women whose
names will be on the ballot in hopes of achieving elective office in
the hypothetical city. Like Lesko, however, all but a few are
venturing onto the landscape of politics for the first time, impelled
by a sense that a brand new city offers ordinary citizens unique
opportunities to take a hand in public affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Their ranks include schoolteachers, small-business owners, actors,
building contractors, a plumbing engineer, a dressmaker, a private
investigator, a psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>   Lesko, who lives in Van Nuys, has worked as a rock-group road
manager and technician, rock pianist, cartoon screenwriter, music
video production manager, recording studio owner and organizer of
charity golf tournaments. He recently put aside his latest and rather
ailing business enterprise, as a self-employed calibrator of air
cargo scales, to devote himself fully to his campaign. "This is very
passionate stuff," he said. "Remember, I've been fixing scales for
five years."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, Lesko haunted Panorama Mall in Panorama
City, which is outside the centrally located 10th district but often
patronized by district residents. The district includes Northridge,
Reseda, North Hills as well as parts of Van Nuys and Encino. He
proffered brightly colored copies of his single campaign brochure
(Slogan: "It's not about family values. It's about the value of
family.") and accosted prospective electors with a jovial "Hi, are
you guys voting in the Nov. 5th election?"</TE>
<TE>   Many said they were not. Many others spoke no English. Others who
expressed interest were showered with half-humorous, extemporaneous,
sometimes nearly stream-of-consciousness campaign-talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Vote for me and I'll abolish parking tickets," he declared to
three amused young men at an MTI mobile phone kiosk in the shopping
mall.</TE>
<TE>   "All right!" the young men chorused.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked away, Lesko confided to a companion, "I'm a
politician now. I'll say anything."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, as he drove his careworn Ford Ranger pickup
truck to collect his fiancee's daughter at school (and do a little
campaigning among waiting parents), a man in a Honda Accord abruptly
swerved into his lane, nearly causing a collision. Lesko caught up
with the errant driver at a red light, and rolled down his window.
The man looked over hesitantly.</TE>
<TE>   "You voting in the Nov. 5th election?" Lesko asked.</TE>
<TE>   The surprised man said he was.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm running for city council," Lesko said. "Vote for me. Look at
the sticker on my rear bumper to get the address of my Web site."</TE>
<TE>   The man, no doubt relieved, nodded he would.</TE>
<TE>   The home-grown nature of Lesko's campaign is evident in his first
campaign signs. They were made of pegboard and painted by 10-year-old
Maggie Moore, the daughter of Lesko's fiancee, Jessica Moore, with
whom he lives. (The couple plan to marry next March; Lesko already
refers to Maggie and her 11-year-old brother Jacob as "my kids.")
More recently, Lesko has acquired professionally printed campaign
signs of bright green.</TE>
<TE>   "My signs were 200 for $300, and that was about my total budget
for the whole election," he said, shaking his head ruefully. "I
started thinking I'd spend zero, but I'm not going to spend more than
a thousand dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Lesko has been withholding most of the new signs for "a blitz"
just before the election. That, he reasons, will give them more
impact, and opponents less time to tear them down, the latter an
important consideration given that he can't afford to buy any more.</TE>
<TE>   His hope is that his expenditure of energy and wherewithal will
prove a wise investment. Although council members' salaries in the
new city would initially be paltry (under state law, $12,000 a year),
he believes future referendums would raise them to $60,000 or $70,000
a year. Frankly, he said, he needs a job, and the council job would
be a good one.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he's been unable to persuade his mother-in-law-to-be, who
opposes Valley secession, to let him stake one of his signs in her
yard. "I need to get her to understand that she can vote for me
without voting to secede," he said. "I need to give her the
'it's-money-for-the-family' talk."</TE>
<TE>   Lesko admits his motives for running are in large part personal.
Last May, he became the owner of a small house, which now often
features a basset hound named Molly lounging by the front door. He
hopes that "like Santa Monica or Burbank," a new Valley city would
mean increased property values.</TE>
<TE>   Self-interest, however, is not his only motivation, he said. A
council seat would also allow him more effectively to do "what I do
anyway, being of service to my neighbors." Lesko long has been active
in Cocaine Anonymous and learned sign language in order to serve as a
volunteer interpreter at public events, and to work with deaf cocaine
abusers.</TE>
<TE>   Later in his day of campaigning, Lesko worked the mothers and
grandmothers picking up children at Stagg Elementary School, a few
blocks from his house.</TE>
<TE>   "I live in your neighborhood; my daughter goes to this school," he
told one young woman he'd buttonholed. "If you vote for me, I'll take
care of you."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, perfect, that's wonderful," she responded.</TE>
<TE>   Encouragement is the lifeblood of political candidates, but one of
the requirements of being worthy of the name is learning to deal with
discouragement.</TE>
<TE>   The afternoon light was waning when Lesko brought his campaign to
the Pumpkin Patch, a Halloween amusement park set up at Lake Balboa
Park. It was a venue for which he had high hopes.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the candidate was seated on a hay bale, Molly the basset
hound slumped at his feet, a stack of undistributed brochures piled
next to him. "This has been kind of a dud," he admitted, looking a
bit forlorn. "What I've been getting is people saying, 'I'm here to
get pumpkins, not to talk politics.' "</TE>
<TE>   Prospects, however, soon began to look rosier. By the time he
called it a day at the Pumpkin Patch, Lesko was able to declare, "I
think I picked up about 10 more votes."</TE>

<HD>Parachutist in Willis Film Presumed Dead Off Pismo</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rescue workers scouring the ocean for a parachutist who disappeared
off Pismo Beach during the filming of a movie said Wednesday that he
is presumed dead and that they are now looking for the body.</LD>
<LD>   Michael K. Barber, 39, of Phoenix, jumped from an airplane with
eight other chutists Tuesday as part of a shoot for a Bruce Willis
movie about Navy SEALs.</LD>
<LD>   The men were supposed to land on the beach at the Oceano Dunes
State Vehicular Recreation Area, but two drifted off course and into
the surf.</LD>
<TE>   One man was quickly pulled to safety. But Barber disappeared into
the water and has not been seen.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Screen Actors Guild, of which Barber was a
member, dispatched representatives from its national stunt and safety
department to investigate the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The union created the special branch a year ago to look into
accidents and deaths on shoots, spokeswoman Ilyanne Kichaven said.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, which is called "Tears of the Sun" and is set to be
released in March, Willis plays a Special Operations commander who
leads his team into the jungle of Nigeria to rescue a doctor and
refugee children.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the movie has been shot, and neither the director nor
Willis was in Pismo Beach on Tuesday. In a statement, officials at
Revolution Studios in Santa Monica said they were cooperating with
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a devastating event for all involved," the statement
said. "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of
Mike Barber."</TE>
<TE>   Oceano Dunes park is a popular spot for filming, said Baxter
Boyington of the San Luis Obispo film commission. Cecile B. DeMille's
1923 "The Ten Commandments" was filmed there.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Christian School Sues City</HD>
<DH>Campus officials say seldom-enforced land-use rules have
cost the senior high a third of its enrollment and threaten its
survival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A struggling Christian high school on Wednesday sued the city of
Ventura, alleging officials are deliberately driving it toward
bankruptcy with seldom-enforced land-use rules.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Ventura
County Christian High School contended the city's allegedly arbitrary
shutdown of portable classrooms on the midtown campus has cost the
school nearly one-third of its enrollment.</LD>
<LD>   Unless a judge allows use of the buildings, the school could be
forced to close, the lawsuit said.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, classes continue -- though some have been dropped -- in
rented space at a church across the street.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is the latest problem to beset the five-acre patch
that is home to the once-stately Washington School, a 1925 building
that became a haunt for vagrants and vandals after it was shut in
1983. Three years ago, the Ventura Unified School District agreed to
lease the property to the Christian school for $1 a year, with the
private institution agreeing to transform it into a working campus.</TE>
<TE>   But the future of the 20-year deal was threatened last fall when
city officials insisted on a number of expensive improvements the
school said it could not afford.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Boehm, Ventura's city attorney, declined comment on the
suit, saying he would need time to study it.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bays, a Christian High School parent and one of its key
financial donors, said the school's problems stem partly from an
anti-religious bias among some city employees.</TE>
<TE>   "We played by the rules from the beginning and never asked anyone
for special treatment," he said. "We're just asking not to be
discriminated against."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is based on the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, a federal law that requires
government to treat religious and secular groups equally.</TE>
<TE>   The school's problems began last October, when two of its
neighbors complained to the city that the portable classroom
buildings had been set too close to their backyards. That prompted
city officials to demand the school acquire a conditional use permit
before the buildings could be used.</TE>
<TE>   But the permit would have meant some big expenses, including
$40,000 in traffic mitigation fees and at least $20,000 for moving
the portables to another site on campus. On top of that, the school
had already spent about $100,000 and obtained at least that much in
free services as the old building got a fresh coat of paint, a new
roof and a wrought-iron fence.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, school officials were convinced they were answerable not
to the city but to their landlords at the school district.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike other properties throughout the city, school district
properties are regulated by the school district," contended Bays, a
plaintiff in the suit. "The city has no authority here."</TE>
<TE>   School officials bolstered that belief by researching other
private groups operating out of portable buildings at Ventura public
schools. They found at least eight sites where day-care centers and
other businesses were not required by the city to obtain conditional
use permits, according to the suit. Also, a Native American group
that recently left a leased building on the Washington Elementary
School campus had not been forced to obtain a permit, the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also alluded to alleged anti-Christian comments by city
staff members.</TE>
<TE>   "Who do you Christians think you are?" a city planner was alleged
to have remarked at a 1996 meeting. "You won't ever get that
property. It has to go to the city first and it is going to be
low-income housing."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Darby, a Christian High School board member and another of
the suit's plaintiffs, said she was at that meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I believe in miracles," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Tingstrom was Ventura's mayor when he brokered the
arrangement between the school district and the Christian high
school. On Wednesday, he said he was angered by the city's recent
demands of the school.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's criminal and uncalled for," he said. "After all
these years, why all of a sudden did they do this? It just doesn't
pass the smell test."</TE>
<TE>   But Don Austin, an attorney for the Ventura Unified School
District, said he thought officials of the private high school may
have misinterpreted the law. While construction of public schools is
regulated by the state, private facilities on public campuses can be
regulated by the city, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested the problem hadn't arisen at other Ventura schools
because local residents may not have complained to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Before the lawsuit is heard by a jury, the school will ask a judge
for an order allowing occupancy of the portables, said Nicholas P.
Miller, a Los Angeles attorney representing the school.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the school must pay about $3,400 a month to rent the
unused buildings as well as pay rent for its current classroom space.</TE>
<TE>   The school's enrollment has dwindled from 90 to 54 in the past
year, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   If the suit fails, the school will go on, Bays said, vowing,
"We'll persevere at some level in another place."</TE>

<HD>Tackling a Fabric Stain of Huge Proportions</HD>
<DH>Two cloth-covered domes housing coke are coated in a grime
that defies cleanup efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Ferrell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't complain to James E. Holland about your soiled carpet or
shirt-collar ring. He's grappled for most of three years with the
granddaddy of all fabric stains: grime covering more than four acres,
the entire surface of two immense domes on Terminal Island.</LD>
<LD>   The fabric-covered domes were once nearly white. Now, for reasons
no one can fully explain, they are the blackened color of a child's
dirty knees.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Export Terminal shelled out $20 million to build
the domes in 1998 and 1999, and has spent virtually all of the time
since then in a futile battle to remove the dirt, said Holland, the
facility's vice president of operations.</LD>
<TE>   Consultants have been brought in. Various cleansers have been
tried. Holland has scrubbed the walls himself, out beyond the
oleander hedges, and has weighed the merits of various protective
coatings.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has come close to working.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an embarrassment," he said. "It's a major frustration."</TE>
<TE>   Each dome is 140 feet tall, topped by an additional 30-some feet
of squarish housings for conveyor equipment. In a landscape otherwise
dominated by square lines and angles, the adjoining domes are
distinctive features of Los Angeles Harbor, filling your field of
vision if you cross the Vincent Thomas Bridge traveling east toward
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   They were created in response to community outcry and a ruling by
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which decreed that
dust-causing petroleum coke -- a byproduct of oil refining used for
export -- can no longer be stored in the open air.</TE>
<TE>   The privately operated export terminal collects tons of the black,
gravelly substance from nearby refineries and loads it onto ships
bound for Japan, Thailand, Europe and the Philippines. The coke,
worth upward of $10 a ton on the world market, is burned overseas as
a fuel for power plants, cement factories and steel mills.</TE>
<TE>   Domes were seen as the most cost-efficient way to stockpile the
material. Each one can store up to 75,000 metric tons of coke until
it can be transported to freighters by means of a mile-long, covered
conveyor belt.</TE>
<TE>   The domes' deep charcoal appearance has become a public relations
nightmare, however. Even though homeowners fought to put them in
place, some critics say the stains symbolize the continuing pollution
problem at the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Diesel fumes, coke dust, oil smoke, tire rubber and other
chemicals form a "toxic goulash," as one activist called it, that
invades San Pedro and Wilmington any time the breezes stir.</TE>
<TE>   The AQMD estimates that 34,000 trucks a day roll through the
harbor, billowing tons of airborne contaminants. A container ship in
port for three days spews as much as an entire day's output from an
oil refinery.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I don't inhale, I guess, I'm fine," said activist Judy
Cairns.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Schwab, who moved to Wilmington as a child in 1927, has
attended community meetings about dust and air pollution for six
years. His wife, Gertrude, a former Los Angeles Harbor commissioner,
was one of the more vocal residents until she became ill and died in
April, a few months after being diagnosed as having lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "Never smoked," Schwab said. "That's what's happening: We've got a
big epidemic of cancer in this community, and asthma."</TE>
<TE>   Schwab understands that trucks and ships account for most of the
airborne pollution, but he also looks askance at the discolored
domes.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're black -- and they were white -- where's the black
coming from?" Schwab said. "It tells you that they're leaking. [The
coke dust] is in the air. Everybody can see it on the domes."</TE>
<TE>   Coke dust, though not a carcinogen, is extremely fine and thus a
serious health risk, said Carol Coy, an AQMD compliance engineer who
helped develop the new storage regulations. Similar types of fine
dust have been linked to asthma, respiratory infections and premature
death, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But residents are misguided if they criticize the domes, which
have accomplished their purpose by eliminating tons of airborne
pollution, Coy added.</TE>
<TE>   Very little coke dust now finds its way into the air, Coy said,
and it is infinitesimal in quantity compared to the enormous amounts
of matter, including carcinogens, that pour out of diesels and ships,
making the harbor one of the region's most dangerous places for
cancer risk.</TE>
<TE>   "The domes are the solution," she said. "They don't leak. [They]
are actually what the community begged for for years."</TE>
<TE>   Holland said the real mystery is why dirt sticks so tenaciously to
the domes while surrounding buildings remain relatively clean. One
theory is that the nonporous fabric and foam layer beneath it create
a static electrical charge -- like a sock pulled from a dryer.</TE>
<TE>   The domes tend to be darkest where the underlying layers of foam
are the thickest. A consultant suggests that the plasticizer used in
the foam has been breaking down and migrating to the surface, causing
a stickiness that catches airborne grit.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly," Holland said, "we haven't figured it out."</TE>
<TE>   Domes have the advantage of containing a large amount of material
within a small space. Construction involved laying down rings of
concrete, attaching fabric to them and inflating the fabric with air.
Foam was then sprayed onto the interior. Reinforcing steel bars and
concrete were set in place beneath that.</TE>
<TE>   Holland compared it to spraying a swimming pool upside down.</TE>
<TE>   From 100 to 200 covered trucks arrive at the facility every day,
dumping more than 20 tons per trip. The coke forms mountainous piles
inside the domes, a nearly black landscape despite powerful ceiling
lights.</TE>
<TE>   Bulldozers climb a steep ramp to enter the domes, moving the coke
into funnel-like "draw-downs" that feed the conveyor system. The coke
finally gushes out at a rate of nearly 5,000 tons an hour into the
holds of cargo ships.</TE>
<TE>   Working in the domes is surreal, dozer operators say. Steam rises
from the piles. Machinery vibrates. In the blackness, the walls seem
to close in.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to have your mind on your work," said veteran Jim
Callazzo, 73.</TE>
<TE>   Although some see the domes as an interesting landmark on Terminal
Island, operators of the export terminal cast their own vote when
they opened a third, 75,000-ton coke storage structure earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding the chance to extend a line of domes across the harbor
landscape, they opted for the most boring design they could come up
with: a building known as The Shed.</TE>
<TE>   But it's as clean as a starched shirt.</TE>

<HD>Natural-Gas Bus Fuel Depots Are Trouble for O.C. Agency</HD>
<DH>The novel underground two-tank system is causing problems.
A $1-million AQMD grant will help build an aboveground backup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two novel fuel stations that supply liquefied natural gas to the
county's ailing fleet of clean-air transit buses have been inadequate
and undependable, regional air quality regulators say.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Transportation Authority operates two fuel
depots for 232 natural gas buses at facilities in Anaheim and Garden
Grove. The stations, which cost $4.5 million each, include two
underground 25,000-gallon tanks, although virtually all such
facilities elsewhere are aboveground.</LD>
<LD>   The underground design -- and unusual size -- of the tanks means
using custom pumping equipment, which has proved troublesome and
costs more to maintain and repair.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the board of the South Coast Air Quality
Management District granted the transportation agency $1 million to
help build a new 30,000-gallon fueling system as a backup and to
provide for bus fleet growth. The overall project will cost between
$1.4 million and $1.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA and air quality officials say the existing tanks have several
problems, including undependable pumps and heaters used to warm
super-cooled liquefied natural gas as it enters bus fuel tanks. The
buses themselves have had mechanical problems, costing the agency
about $1 million in repair bills and forcing the return of polluting
diesel buses to the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality officials have been working with the OCTA to resolve
many of the fuel-station problems. Their efforts have led to a
reengineering of the systems and plans to add the conventional,
aboveground station.</TE>
<TE>   "They took a very novel approach and ran into difficulties that no
one envisioned," said Henry Hogo, an AQMD officer who specializes in
science and technology. "We have managed to solve a lot of the
problems."</TE>
<TE>   AQMD has supported clean-fuel vehicles to reduce air pollution.
Funding for district grants comes from fines and settlements
collected by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   James Ortner, the OCTA's manager of technical services, insists
that the tank problems have not affected bus operations, other than
by requiring more time to fuel coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We are managing these problems," Ortner said. "We have never
missed putting a bus on the street on time."</TE>
<TE>   There is only one other underground fueling station in the United
States -- in Pennsylvania -- and it serves only seven vehicles, not a
fleet of buses.</TE>
<TE>   Hogo said the stations worked well when the transportation
authority had only 20 buses that relied on liquefied natural gas. As
the fleet of clean-air buses grew to more than 200, problems arose,
and fueling vehicles took far longer.</TE>
<TE>   Once the fueling systems were enlarged to accommodate the larger
fleet, the pumps vibrated, and valves were shaking off. Heaters used
to warm the fuel also were unreliable.</TE>
<TE>   A new fueling station would help the OCTA service its buses and
provide a reliable backup whenever there were problems with the
underground facilities, AQMD officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2000, when OCTA was considering putting the tanks
underground, the authority's leadership was told they would cost $3.5
million more than aboveground facilities and be more difficult to
maintain and repair.</TE>
<TE>   "Your agency is about to waste another $3.5 million on a facility
it doesn't need," said James N. Harger, a vice president of Pickens
Fuel Corp. "From a taxpayer standpoint and [as] an industry expert, I
am appalled at the lack of professionalism displayed by your staff to
the community and our company."</TE>
<TE>   Pickens, which is owned by Texas oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens, had
proposed building a cheaper aboveground facility for OCTA with a
50,000-gallon capacity but was rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Ortner said the agency wanted underground tanks for security
reasons, as well as to save space at the Garden Grove and Anaheim
stations. He said the cost difference between above- and below-ground
facilities was only $100,000, a figure Harger disputes.</TE>

<HD>O.C.'s Bus-Fuel Tanks Cause Hassles</HD>
<DH>The underground natural-gas system is a headache for the
transit authority. A $1-million AQMD grant will help build an
aboveground backup.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two novel fuel stations that supply liquefied natural gas to the
county's ailing fleet of clean-air transit buses have been inadequate
and undependable, regional air quality regulators say.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Transportation Authority operates two fuel
depots for 232 natural gas buses at facilities in Anaheim and Garden
Grove. The stations, which cost $4.5 million each, include two
underground 25,000-gallon tanks, although virtually all such natural
gas storage facilities elsewhere are aboveground.</LD>
<LD>   The underground design -- and unusual size -- of the tanks means
using custom pumping equipment, which has proved troublesome and
costs more to maintain and repair.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the board of the South Coast Air Quality
Management District granted the transportation agency $1 million to
help build a new 30,000-gallon fueling system as a backup and to
provide for bus fleet growth.</TE>
<TE>   The overall project will cost between $1.4 million and $1.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA and air quality officials say the existing tanks have several
problems, including undependable pumps and heaters used to warm
super-cooled liquefied natural gas as it enters bus fuel tanks. The
buses themselves have had mechanical problems, costing the agency
about $1 million in repair bills and forcing the return of polluting
diesel buses to the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality officials have been working with the OCTA to resolve
many of the fuel-station problems. Their efforts have led to a
reengineering of the systems and plans to add the conventional,

<TE>   "They took a very novel approach and ran into difficulties that no

stations. He said the cost difference between above- and below-ground
facilities was only $100,000, a figure Harger disputes.</TE>
<TE>   "T. Boone Pickens wanted business from us," Ortner said. "We had
other sources. Our board told Jim Harger, 'Thank you very much, we
like the direction we are going.' "We would reassess building them
underground today," Ortner said.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches powered by liquefied natural gas make up 44% of OCTA's
fleet of 523 transit buses. The authority bought the vehicles from a
Hungarian manufacturer in 1998, when federal rules went into effect
banning the purchase of diesel buses and requiring all buses to run
on clean fuel by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the buses have constantly needed repair ever since.
Most problems involve the fuel system. It is not uncommon for more
than 30 of the buses a day to be out of service awaiting repairs.</TE>
<TE>   The authority has been withholding a final $1.7 million payment to
the manufacturer, North American Bus Industries, until the problems
are solved. The owner of the company has accused OCTA of illegally
withholding the payment.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Arthur Leahy, OCTA's chief executive officer, reported
to the board of directors that tensions between the bus company and
the authority have eased.</TE>
<TE>   "The chairman of the company has been talking to us about the
problems," Leahy said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any cures yet, just a more cooperative vendor."</TE>

<HD>Court Halts Work at L.A. Port</HD>
<DH>Appeals panel bars completing $47-million project pending
review of impact on residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a major setback for a Port of Los Angeles expansion project, a
three-judge panel on Wednesday permanently enjoined construction of a
massive new terminal near the Vincent Thomas Bridge, pending a review
of its impacts on the health and safety of local residents.</LD>
<LD>   In a unanimous ruling, the 2nd District Court of Appeal panel
sided with a coalition of community and environmental groups that
argued the city violated state environmental law by failing to gauge
the cumulative impact of the entire project before allowing
construction of the first of its three phases, a $47-million wharf
that is 83% complete.</LD>
<LD>   The court order bars the pouring of 200 additional feet of
concrete needed to complete the wharf.</LD>
<TE>   The coalition contends that the terminal, which is being built 500
feet away from San Pedro homes, will spew cancer-causing diesel
exhaust and generate other potentially harmful effects, including
trips by as many as 1 million trucks a year on local streets and
freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an amazing slap in the face of the Port of Los Angeles,"
said attorney Gail Ruderman Feuer of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, one of the principal litigants in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's a spectacular win for the people who have been battling
the port for decades over the right to breathe without fear," she
said. "This is the first time a court has stepped in and told the
port that it must follow the law to protect the rights of the
communities."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Councilwoman Janice Hahn, whose district includes the
port, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Chalk one up for the little guys," she said. "We don't want to
stop port operations entirely, we only want to get at the truth about
this project. But it seems the only way to get at the truth is to
stop it in its tracks."</TE>
<TE>   Port officials counter that the process of reviewing the project's
environmental effects was approved by the Los Angeles City Council,
the California Costal Commission and other state and federal
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, the judges stayed further construction pending a final
decision on the project, which has been engulfed in controversy since
the Los Angeles City Council more than a year ago awarded China
Shipping a $650-million lease on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's decision raised questions about the ultimate fate of
the construction effort originally intended to include two wharves
designed to handle 260 cargo ships and 1.5 million 20-foot containers
a year.</TE>
<TE>   City officials expressed concerns that China Shipping may decide
to pull up stakes and seek a new home for its terminal elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the four 16-story cranes the firm bought for $7
million each. The cranes, which are currently being stored on a barge
in the harbor, may never be erected given that activists contend they
will block coastal views.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they sink," said San Pedro activist Janet Gunter, who has
urged that the city consider buying less intrusive collapsible
cranes.</TE>
<TE>   Such ideas had been summarily dismissed by port authorities as so
much wishful thinking. Not anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever needs to be done will be done," said Harbor Commission
President Nick Tonsich. "We've requested that staff take a better
look at collapsible cranes."</TE>
<TE>   Harbor-area organizations originally filed a lawsuit 18 months ago
in Los Angeles Superior Court against Los Angeles, the Los Angeles
Harbor Department and China Shipping.</TE>
<TE>   The state court ruled against the coalition, which includes the
Natural Resources Defense Council, San Pedro and Peninsula Homeowners
Coalition, San Pedro Homeowners United Inc. and the Coalition for
Clean Air.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition appealed the state court ruling. But it also moved
to federal court, challenging a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit
to build the first wharf. The corps approved that phase after
determining that the terminal would actually improve regional air
quality by enhancing the efficiency of cargo handling in an existing
industrial zone.</TE>
<TE>   In August, a federal judge rejected the coalition's request to
halt construction, and the work continued.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the state appellate court reversed the earlier state
court's decision until a new environmental review is completed.
Lawyers on both sides of the issue said that could take six months or
longer.</TE>
<TE>   Port officials have predicted that delays caused by a court order
could cost the port about $1.2 million a month. They also fear that
such delays may damage their reputation as good business partners
with some of the world's largest shipping firms.</TE>
<TE>   David McKenna, who is in charge of the city attorney's harbor
division, which fought the coalition's challenge, said, "The reversal
of the trial court decision is disappointing. Hopefully, we'll be
able to move forward with the project. We'll comply with all
requirements."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Feuer said it was unlikely that "the city would have
to tear up the nearly completed wharf." But she said the new
environmental review will "take into consideration whether the
project's later phases still make sense."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Jesse Marquez, chairman of the Wilmington
Coalition for a Safe Environment, said, "I'm just happy the justices
made an honorable and correct decision to uphold California
environmental laws, and respect the public's interests."</TE>
<TE>   "When I first heard about the ruling, a tear came to my eye, and I
sighed with relief," he said. "We've put in thousands of hours trying
to prove our point and, until today, it seemed like no one wanted to
listen."</TE>

<HD>Vandals Destroy 15 Trees in Granada Hills</HD>
<DH>Replacement of the 14 flowering saplings and a sycamore
will cost a contractor more than $7,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mulch.</LD>
<LD>   That's about all that can be done with 14 flowering saplings and a
sycamore tree that vandals destroyed in Granada Hills this month.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody's upset and angry," resident Paul Libis said as he
scanned a row of trees along Sesnon Boulevard, where broken,
inch-thick branches still lay in the gutter. "I can't imagine anybody
local would do this."</LD>
<TE>   Libis, 50, and his brother, Steven, 48, noticed the damaged trees
about a week ago while jogging through the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   International Environmental Corp. planted the trees last month as
part of a city beautification program. Landscaping contractor Henry
Cespedes said the company is responsible for maintenance of the trees
for a month after planting.</TE>
<TE>   It will cost him about $7,000 to replace the 14 pink- or
lavender-flowering Chitalpa trees near O'Melveny Park that were
snapped in half. Cespedes also must replace a sycamore about a mile
up the street where 11 more trees were stripped of branches, but can
be saved.</TE>
<TE>   Cespedes said that in the nearly 40 years he's contracted with the
city of Los Angeles, only once or twice has his work been destroyed
by vandals.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police said the vandalism was reported Oct. 18.
Cespedes said he planned to file a police report.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Morriss, an inspector for the city's street tree division,
said such vandalism occurs more often near schools and parks, rather
than in front of homes.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the tops of about 60 newly planted trees were lopped off
along Victory Boulevard in Valley Glen. A North Hollywood man was
charged with vandalizing the trees, allegedly in retaliation for
traffic tickets he had received. The case has not yet gone to court.</TE>

<HD>Group Behind Tustin Mailer Lists False Donor</HD>
<DH>Law firm head says she never heard of or contributed to an
organization that sent a brochure slamming a City Council candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County prosecutors are being asked to investigate a political
mailer sent to Tustin residents by a group that falsely lists its
address as that of a major Southern California law firm and its
largest contributor as the firm's co-managing partner.</LD>
<LD>   The downtown Los Angeles address given by Education Alliance of
Orange County, whose name is similar to a well-known Tustin-based
group, is the same as attorneys Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. In a
campaign report filed with the city Oct. 24, the group listed the
firm's co-managing partner, Marjorie Lewis, as a $3,000 donor.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis said she had never heard of the group nor given it any
money. She said she was unaware of the mailer until Monday, when she
received several messages from the firm's attorneys in Orange County
wanting to know why she'd get involved in the Tustin council race,
where six candidates are vying for two seats.</LD>
<TE>   "Someone very deliberately sought to use my name," Lewis said.
"I'd like to get to the bottom of it."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bucher, who has operated The Education Alliance for several
years from offices in Tustin, said he prepared a complaint Wednesday
for Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas. William Davis, the treasurer for
Education Alliance of Orange County, listed a private mailbox
business in Tustin as his address, but gave Bucher's address to
postal officials.</TE>
<TE>   Bucher said his group had nothing to do with the new group or its
mailer, and knew nothing of Davis. "This isn't dirty campaigning,
it's criminal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The mailer, sent earlier this month to absentee voters, alleged
that council candidate Doug Davert had assaulted two women at a
Tustin Unified School District board meeting in 1997. The mailer
showed photographs taken from a videotape -- one of a man threatening
a woman and a second showing the man being removed by a security
officer.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot allow this to happen in Tustin," the mailer said. It
noted in smaller print that the event depicted wasn't the meeting
Davert attended. The mailer alleged, however, that "numerous
eyewitnesses" saw Davert assaulting the women.</TE>
<TE>   Davert, who served five years as a city planning commissioner,
admitted in an interview Wednesday that he shouted at a woman during
a March 1997 meeting held to discuss changes in school boundaries. He
said he was offended after she accused him of making racist remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "I got in her face and said, 'You'd better think before you call
me a racist,' " he said, describing the incident as a 30-second
altercation. There was no physical exchange, he said, though he did
"use some profanity." Davert was asked to leave the meeting during a
break and did.</TE>
<TE>   "I can handle a vicious hit piece but now these people [behind the
mailer] are hiding," he said. "I have an impeccable record as a
citizen. I'm incensed. The subterfuge is mind-boggling."</TE>
<TE>   Calls to the south Orange County phone number listed by Davis
weren't returned Wednesday. The group reported collecting $7,050 in
contributions, including small amounts from North Tustin activist
Dessa Schroeder and Carol McCauley of San Diego, who attended the
1997 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Both women were quoted in the mailer complaining of Davert's
"frightening conduct," Davert said. Neither could be reached for
comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   School board trustee Jane Bauer said she was called in May or June
by a "Bill Davis" of the Education Alliance asking her to provide a
quote for the mailer. She declined. Bauer said she was upset,
however, when three other trustees sent letters to voters in recent
days defending Davert and denying that he'd behaved badly at the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a loose cannon," she said.</TE>

<HD>12th District Is a Study in Variety</HD>
<DH>Candidates for the Valley city council seek to mesh needs
of NoHo arts area, masses of tenants and longtime homeowners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Hong</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 12th district of the proposed San Fernando Valley city council is
dense, bustling and diverse, taking in endless blocks of apartment
buildings but also cloistered neighborhoods of grand homes. The needs
of the North Hollywood-Valley Village district, as spelled out by the
seven candidates for the seat, are similarly varied.</LD>
<LD>   They range from sidewalks on some residential streets to better
lighting in the NoHo arts district to a continuation of rent control
for all those apartment dwellers. The candidates also want lower
business taxes, more police officers and a say in any expansion of
nearby Burbank Airport. The winner will take office if Valley
secession wins at the polls Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of candidates are talking about breaking up the school
district, but for me those are not the issues that come first," said
Carlos Ferreyra, a longtime secession activist and perhaps the
best-known contender in the 12th district, which also includes Toluca
Lake, Valley Glen and part of Studio City.</LD>
<TE>   Ferreyra, 50, a Valley Village resident who owns a medical
equipment sales business, said his top priority would be "ensuring
the city of the future has the best municipal services, including
police and fire service, for the cost."</TE>
<TE>   Earl Howard, 37, a billing manager at a law firm, is among the
candidates pushing for a breakup of the Los Angeles Unified School
District. The secession election does not involve the schools, but
Valley cityhood proponents say a new municipality could persuade the
state to carve up the LAUSD.</TE>
<TE>   Howard also describes himself as a progressive who will fight for
rent control and a living-wage law in a Valley city, as well as for
road and sidewalk repairs in neglected areas of the district.</TE>
<TE>   Daryl A. Sanchez, 35, of Toluca Lake, is running because his goal
"has always been to work in government service." A recent
Southwestern University law school graduate, Sanchez said that as a
council member he would "make sure the new city would be fiscally
responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Sheftel, 41, said he would work for more homeless and drug
rehabilitation programs. The Valley Glen resident, who owns a North
Hollywood candy store, would also focus on street repair and cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   "The streets are terrible; there are potholes everywhere," Sheftel
said. "In some areas there are no sidewalks, and refuse stays on the
street for weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Victor N. Viereck, 63, an accountant, Realtor and apartment owner,
wants to cut the business license tax and promote housing
construction by streamlining the planning and permitting process.</TE>
<TE>   Viereck, a former head accountant for the LAUSD, said his
experience makes him well-suited for the challenges of starting a
city.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only do we need a new Valley city, we need people who
understand taxation, budgets and housing. I have experience and
background in all those areas," he said.</TE>
<TE>   David Molony, 41, is a computer programmer who just completed a
one-year term as executive director of the California Libertarian
Party. Molony, who moved to Valley Glen a year ago from San
Francisco, said he wants to "lower tax rates and lower the costs of
doing government. I've always felt less government is better."</TE>
<TE>   Dion Gazzaruso, 34, a finance manager for Valley Holiday Inc., a
commercial real estate holding company, did not return phone calls
requesting an interview. The candidate's Web site lists his
priorities as better policing, representation for a Valley city on
the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport board, improved street lighting
and support for the NoHo arts district.</TE>

<HD>Conflict-of--Interest Probe of Ex-Elections Staffer Sought</HD>
<DH>The official helped certify voting machines, then joined a
firm that sells the devices. He denies any impropriety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California's elections chief has requested a formal investigation of
a former staff member who helped certify voting machines for use in
the state, then went to work for one of the vendors.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Bill Jones asked the state's political watchdog
agency this week to examine whether the conduct of his former voting
systems director, Lou Dedier, constituted a conflict of interest or
other impropriety under the Political Reform Act.</LD>
<LD>   Until his resignation Oct. 14, Dedier's duties included compiling
evaluations and tests for an in-house panel that decided whether to
allow vendors to sell their voting machines to California counties.</LD>
<TE>   Dedier, 39, quit to work as a vice president overseeing California
operations for Elections Systems &amp; Software, a Nebraska company
competing for a share of hundreds of millions of dollars that
counties are expected to spend to upgrade their voting systems in
coming years.</TE>
<TE>   "I am insulted that after 22 years as a state employee, an
accusation of inappropriate conduct would come up," Dedier said in an
interview Wednesday. "I know I did not violate anything. I was very
careful."</TE>
<TE>   Dedier said the firm was already certified in California when he
joined Jones' office about two years ago. He said he showed no
favoritism toward his prospective employer and, in fact, recommended
the full certification of a competing firm as his final act as a
state employee.</TE>
<TE>   State law prohibits employees from using their official position
to influence governmental decisions affecting prospective employers.</TE>
<TE>   James Rhoades, Kern County's registrar of voters, said that when
he visited the secretary of state's office in April, Dedier had a
worker demonstrate an Elections Systems voting machine.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very enthusiastic about the technology and potential of
the machine, but he said that because of his job, [he] could not
recommend any product," said Rhoades, who added that the county
bought a system from a competing company.</TE>
<TE>   Dedier said that Elections Systems did not offer him a job until
this month and that a few vendors left demonstration equipment in the
office for local election officials to examine.</TE>
<TE>   "I always would tell the elections officials that all the
equipment is good and they need to select the equipment that suits
their needs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing his hiring on Oct. 16, the company said Dedier will
"lead the ES&amp;S partnership" with local election officials who will be
modernizing their systems. And Dedier said in the news release, "I've
evaluated several election management vendors over the years, and
ES&amp;S clearly has by far the best elections systems and support."</TE>
<TE>   That statement upset Jones because he said it unfairly undercut
the credibility of his office's multilayered certification process,
which includes independent evaluations by outside experts.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it was inappropriate," Jones said in an interview. "I
want to make clear to all vendors that each has an opportunity ...
under the transparent process we established."</TE>
<TE>   Two competitors complained about Dedier's move in letters to Jones
that were forwarded Monday to the state Fair Political Practices
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Diebold Election Systems representative Deborah Seiler said her
company was concerned that Dedier could share with his new employer
proprietary information from competing companies. Dedier's
activities, she wrote, "may raise ethical concerns as well as
potential conflict-of-interest violations."</TE>
<TE>   Another vendor, Hart InterCivic, raised a question about "missing"
company documents sent to the secretary of state's office, saying,
"Due to recent developments with Lou Dedier's employment status, we
are very concerned about the disposition of this documentation, as it
contains intellectual property and trade secret information."</TE>
<TE>   Dedier said he was not privy to anything that was not public
information and did not remove anything from Jones' office except
personal property. "I would welcome anyone searching my home, my
[computer] system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   An FPPC spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Former state employees are banned for a year from influencing the
departments where they previously worked. Dedier said he will neither
lobby the state nor be involved in sales.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two animal rights groups have asked the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service to list the Anacapa deer mouse as an endangered species and
immediately halt a rat eradication program underway on Anacapa
Island.</LD>
<LD>   The Fund for Animals and the Channel Islands Animal Protection
Assn. filed an emergency petition Tuesday, saying the poisoning of
black rats was wiping out the indigenous island deer mouse.</LD>
<LD>   The National Park Service began poisoning black rats last year to
prevent the rodents from feeding on the eggs of endangered seabirds.
The rats also eat deer mice, park officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "The deer mice are doing extremely well," said Kate Faulkner,
chief of resources management for Channel Islands National Park.
"There is no threat of eradication."</TE>
<TE>   But Michael Makarian, president of the New York-based Fund for
Animals, said the park service was causing an "ecological disaster"
with its poisoning campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The group failed in an attempt last year to obtain an injunction
to stop the program.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Wildlife Service has 90 days to make a decision.</TE>

<HD>Burk May Organize Masters Protests</HD>
<DH>Head of women's group is unhappy with Finchem's response to
questions about relationship between PGA Tour and Augusta National.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Besides flowering azaleas, the blooming dogwood, Magnolia Lane and
Rae's Creek, here's something else you can probably expect to see at
the Masters next April at Augusta National Golf Club -- protesters.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Burk, chair of the National Council of Women's
Organizations, didn't care much for what she learned Wednesday in PGA
Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem's state-of-the-tour message, so Burk
said there very well could be women's rights protesters outside the
tall hedges and gates of Augusta National and stretching down
Washington Road when the 67th Masters begins the week of April 7.</LD>
<LD>   "If nothing has changed, I'm sure we're going to see some public
demonstrations of unhappiness," Burk said.</LD>
<TE>   At a news conference in Atlanta, Finchem was asked several
questions involving the PGA Tour's posture regarding the Masters and
Augusta National, which has no female members, and whether that
stance runs contrary to the PGA Tour's policy of not holding
tournaments at golf clubs with exclusionary membership policies.</TE>
<TE>   It is the PGA Tour's position that because it has no contractual
or co-sponsorship agreement with Augusta National Golf Club, the
policy has not been breached. Finchem relayed this response in a
four-paragraph letter he wrote to Burk on Aug. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Finchem told reporters Wednesday at East Lake Country Club in
Atlanta that his letter to Burk speaks for itself and he was not
willing to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very straightforward in answering the question that she
posed with respect to whether or not we would consider withdrawing
recognition from the Masters as a major championship on our tour,"
Finchem said. "We said while we appreciated and respected her
position, and we do, that's just something for all factors considered
that we were not prepared to do. So we have been very clear on that."</TE>
<TE>   Finchem had a less polished response when he fielded a question
that hinted about a possible protest at the Masters and what his
reaction would be.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I know, there's going to be a tournament at Augusta,
the Masters, and it's going to be on CBS television and our players
are going to go play," he said. "What else happens, I'm not going to
speculate on that."</TE>
<TE>   Burk expected something different from Finchem and said she was
upset she didn't get it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm astounded," she said. "I expected him to try to justify what
the tour is doing or make a comment that it's under review.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's dreaming if the PGA Tour continues to stonewall and
it's going against its own policies. What he's done is to establish
the PGA Tour as an arm of Augusta National ... a lackey. He hops to
their tune. He answers to Hootie [Johnson] and nobody else."</TE>
<TE>   Burk's group, a coalition of 160-member organizations, is waging a
campaign to force Augusta to admit a female member by the 2003
Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Burk contends that the PGA Tour is creating a double standard that
benefits Augusta by counting the prize money for the season totals of
players. And, by allowing the Masters to continue to receive
recognition by the PGA Tour while the club "discriminates against
women," Burk says the tour is giving its stamp of approval to the
practices at Augusta National.</TE>
<TE>   Burk said she has not spoken with any of the PGA Tour's primary
sponsors -- Coca-Cola, Buick and Nationwide -- about the tour's
position on Augusta National, but she said it is in her plans to do
so.</TE>
<TE>   Finchem said he has spoken with sponsors, but refused to explain
the nature of the conversations. Instead, he stuck to his script.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to discuss what other conversations I've [had] with
sponsors," he said. "I know you're going to try to move me out of the
confines of my statement, but you're not going to be successful."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goodbye Senior Tour, hello Champions Tour. The 23-year-old tour
for professionals 50 and older will tee it up with a new name in
2003, Finchem announced. Also, Finchem didn't talk about it, but
senior players voted two weeks ago to change the rules on carts in
2003. Caddies will not be allowed to use carts, but a player can ride
a cart if he chooses.</TE>
<TE>   Finchem announced one more name change. The Buy.com Tour is now
the Nationwide Tour. Nationwide becomes the fourth title sponsor of
the developmental tour since it began in 1990.</TE>

<LD>Thomas Boswell in the Washington Post: "Traditionalists feared that
someday two wild cards would reach the World Series and disgrace the
event. We would see sloppy play, boring games and an unworthy
champion.</LD>
<LD>   "The Series win of the wild-card Florida Marlins in the dreadfully
inept '97 Series was seen as a warning shot.</LD>
<LD>   "Now, thanks to the Anaheim Angels and the almost equally
excellent San Francisco Giants, we can relax. If this is the kind of
series wild cards can produce, then give us more."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the UCLA record for pass completions in a
game?</TE>
<TE>   Dusty's dilemma: Skip Bayless in the San Jose Mercury News: "Dusty
Baker sounded [recently] like a man who can no longer work under
Peter Magowan for any amount of money.</TE>
<TE>   "The two biggest reasons Baker will strongly consider managing the
Chicago Cubs have nothing to do with money. Baker wants to call his
own shots on player acquisitions. And perhaps even more important,
Baker wants to be treated with more 'respect.'</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes Baker can act more spoiled and ungrateful than Barry
Bonds. Yet Bonds is a far greater player than Baker is a manager.
Bonds has often made Baker look a lot better than he is."</TE>
<TE>   Say it isn't so: From David Letterman: "This is bad news. Earlier
today, North Korea announced that they have the technology to create
their own rally monkey."</TE>
<TE>   More Letterman: His take on the Angels: "It took them 42 years to
win the World Series, or as the Boston Red Sox call it, 'beginner's
luck.' "</TE>
<TE>   That's good casting: Comedy writer Alex Kaseberg in the San
Francisco Chronicle: "The Angels are going to be in a parade, visit
the White House and appear on talk shows. And David Eckstein is going
to star in 'Home Alone 4.' "</TE>
<TE>   Real reason to cry: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "The
image of Dusty Baker's son Darren crying his 3-year-old eyes out
after the Giants lost the series was cute as a button, but think of
the tears he's likely to shed if Dad takes the Cubs' job."</TE>
<TE>   Now, on to other sports: From the Caught on the Fly column in the
Sporting News: "Fly's Top 5 or 'Until Shaq is back, these are the
centers of attention when you look to the West, which explains why
this conference will be forward thinking for now': 1. Raef LaFrentz;
2. Michael Olowokandi; 3. Yao Ming; 4. Vlade Divac; 5. Dale Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1959, USC defeated California, 14-7.
It was USC's sixth straight victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans would go on to record an 8-0 record before losing to
UCLA and Notre Dame in the final two games of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Troy Aikman, 32, against USC in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bill Lankhof of the Toronto Sun on baseball: "It's
the only industry where owners try to outdo each other every season
by announcing who lost the most money.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be suspicious of people who are this eager to prove
how dumb they are."</TE>

<HD>Bad First Impression by Clippers</HD>
<DH>They open season by playing in lackluster fashion, losing
to Cavaliers, 98-96, on Ilgauskas' late shot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No contract talk. No second-guessing trades. No fretting over
injuries. The Clippers had a game to play Wednesday night and it was
time to worry about putting the ball in the basket more often than
the opposition.</LD>
<LD>   That other stuff had to be put aside when they tossed up the ball
for the first time at Staples Center. An off-season of decidedly
mixed results was best forgotten when the Clippers took the floor to
face the Cleveland Cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   Judging by their lackluster play during a 98-96 loss to the
woebegone Cavaliers before a nonsellout crowd of 16,822, the Clippers
have a whole new set of concerns.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers simply didn't click in their season opener, falling
with a thud on Zydrunas Ilgauskas' nine-foot turnaround jump shot
with 2.8 seconds left and disappointing Coach Alvin Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not a very good team right now," Gentry said. "Getting beat
to loose balls and giving up 19 offensive rebounds really bothers
me.... We got beat by hustle plays. We've got some guys who've got to
get themselves ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette's basket with 7.3 seconds left pulled the Clippers
into a 96-96 tie. But Ilgauskas, a 7-foot-3 center, never hesitated
in sinking a jumper over Clipper center Michael Olowokandi. He scored
nine of his 19 points in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper loss had nothing to do with the fact that neither
Olowokandi nor Elton Brand got the fat new contracts they coveted
during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   It had a good deal more to do with the fact that neither
Olowokandi nor Brand was fit to play during most of training camp.
Olowokandi had tendinitis in his left knee and a strained left hip
muscle. Brand underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Sept. 26.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the Clippers seemed to believe they could defeat the
Cavaliers by cruising in third gear for most of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough loss," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Andre Miller certainly didn't disappoint in his
Clipper debut, moving the ball with precision. He scored 15 points
with 14 assists in 41 minutes, showing the value of the July 30 trade
that sent Darius Miles to Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi had 18 points and 13 rebounds in 39 minutes. Maggette
and Quentin Richardson each added 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Davis led the Cavaliers with 25 points, eight assists and
seven rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Under different circumstances, Brand might have sat out Wednesday.
Another week of rest and rehabilitation on his knee wouldn't have
hurt, he said before the game. But he pushed hard to return in time
to face the Cavaliers because he's mindful of what's at stake this
season for the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt," Brand said. "The first two weeks [after having
surgery], I just knew I was going to miss the start of the season.
But we want to get off to an excellent start. Every game counts. We
learned that last year when we let a few games slip away from us."</TE>
<TE>   It was clear right from the start that Brand wasn't at his best,
huffing and puffing around the court but not managing to accomplish
much. He would play 27 minutes, but did not score. Brand reported "no
pain," in his knee at game's end.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very frustrating not being out there in the fourth
quarter," he said. "I'll be ready soon."</TE>
<TE>   Miles received a warm reception from a Staples Center crowd that
cheered his frequent flights toward the hoop in two highlight-reel
seasons as a Clipper. Hours before the game, Miles made the rounds at
Staples Center, hugging arena employees, signing autographs and
spending a few minutes with his former teammates.</TE>
<TE>   The game began and Miles, as if on cue, scored the first basket on
a dunk. It was to be Cleveland's only lead of the first half. Miles
scored 15 points in 39 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Elton Brand, Michael Olowokandi and Corey Maggette started up front
Wednesday in the Clippers' season opener against the Cleveland
Cavaliers. It wasn't a surprise, but each had been injured during
training camp and Coach Alvin Gentry was more than a little cagey
when asked Tuesday for his starting lineup.</LD>
<LD>   Brand underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept. 26
and missed almost all of camp. Olowokandi had tendinitis in his left
knee and a strained left hip muscle and also missed the bulk of camp.
Maggette sprained his right thumb in the team's final exhibition game
last week.</LD>
<LD>   Gentry apologized Wednesday for being in a cranky mood the day
before but wouldn't say precisely what had upset him. It's believed
that he was miffed about the Clippers' final cuts Monday. The team
waived forward Mike Batiste and veteran guard Bryant Stith in order
to get to the 15-player limit Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Gentry admired Batiste, in particular, for his scoring ability.
Batiste, from Long Beach Wilson High and Arizona State, led the
Clippers in scoring for a time during their eight-game exhibition
schedule. The Clippers instead kept forward Tremaine Fowlkes, who
filled in for Maggette late last season.</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, the pregame notes listed the Clippers'
starters as Maggette, Cherokee Parks, Sean Rooks, Andre Miller and
Quentin Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry stuck by his training camp prediction that a sprained right
ankle will sideline forward Lamar Odom until at least Christmas. Odom
has been shooting baskets with his teammates, but can't yet run hard,
according to Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   "He's making progress," Gentry said. "Regardless of what anybody
says, it's going to be about Christmas. I don't see anything
miraculous happening. He can't push it any faster with his rehab.
He's got to stay off it and not push it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers added Mel Proctor to their broadcast team. Proctor,
who works for a television station in Palm Springs, will call games
on KXTA (1150) when the team is shown on Channel 5 with announcers
Ralph Lawler and Mike Smith.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Woodie's World"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Today, 4 p.m., ESPN Classic.</LD>
<TE>   Heywood Hale Broun, known to his friends as "Woodie," became
famous for prose that was as colorful as his sports coats. Brown, who
died last year at 83, brought a wry sense of humor and literary
sensibility to the world of sports through his weekly features on the
"CBS Saturday Evening News" during the 1960s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Now ESPN Classic is offering viewers a chance to relive Broun's
reports -- or discover them for the first time. Today's show is the
first of a 13-part series hosted by Bud Lamoreaux, Broun's longtime
producer and colleague.</TE>
<TE>   Each weekly half-hour show will include four of Broun's reports.</TE>
<TE>   The first in tonight's show is on Ted Williams and his return to
baseball at 42 as manager of the Washington Senators in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Another is about the Manitowoc County Chiefs, the nation's oldest
minor league football team. Manitowoc is in Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   Of the players, Broun says, "Shakespeare wrote of the uncertain
glory of an April day. Equally uncertain is the glory of a minor
league football player's night. His bruises are as blue as those in
the NFL, but his paychecks are a lot less green."</TE>
<TE>   You won't find that kind of prose in television sports reporting
these days.</TE>

<KH>Chris Dufresne ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL</KH>
<HD>Irish? Here Are Four New Horsemen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You wouldn't believe the stuff that piles up on a college football
writer's desk during the course of a year in which Notre Dame starts
8-0.</LD>
<LD>   I try my level best to keep up and have more Post-It reminder
notes than a soccer mom but things fall through the cracks --
specifically four of this year's more compelling stories: Iowa,
Georgia, North Carolina State and Bowling Green.</LD>
<LD>   Let the record state these schools are a combined 32-1 with nary a
peep out of your command central correspondent.</LD>
<TE>   Truth is, when Notre Dame is hot the Irish suck media attention
like a fire eats oxygen, and let's just say presently the Irish have
four burners lit.</TE>
<TE>   If this keeps up, you can reach me through December at a post
office box in South Bend.</TE>
<TE>   Miami, of course, has to be covered because the Hurricanes are
defending national champions and haven't lost a game in 25 months, so
I actually saw Miami beat Florida in Gainesville.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma demanded attention during the annual Red River Show Up
(and humiliate) Texas week and Ohio State caught my eye in Columbus
on a trip to scout Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   This hasn't left much time for the Rest of the Nation.</TE>
<TE>   These poor orphans of Notre Dame's success deserve more ink, but
unfortunately my "Things to Do" list was only recently discovered
beneath a pile of potatoes and cabbage.</TE>
<TE>   Memo to self: find out more about:</TE>
<TE>   Iowa: Does team still play in Big Ten; is Hayden Fry still coach?
May be time to get tailback Ronnie Harmon some pub.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State: Find out if games against East Tennessee
State and Massachusetts will hurt Wolfpack's RPI ranking and seeding
in NCAA tournament (Updated memo: Scratch that -- those teams are on
the school's football schedule).</TE>
<TE>   Georgia: Follow-up on Uga VI's off-season trip to Washington.
Heard 4-year-old canine mascot flew to nation's capitol in private
jet and got the red carpet treatment -- most dogs only get their
noses rubbed in it -- in halls of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Bowling Green: There's a Bowling Green in Ohio and Kentucky. Find
out which one has the football team ranked ahead of Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Seriously, with Notre Dame's next game only days away, this might
be the only chance to sneak in a few thumbnail sketches on non-Irish
teams between now and St. Patrick's Day.</TE>
<TE>   * Iowa (8-1): The No. 9 Hawkeyes are coached by Kirk Ferentz
(turns out Fry retired years ago) and are possibly Rose Bowl bound.
The Hawkeyes' only loss was to rival Iowa State but the team has won
six consecutive games since, including a Big Ten, 34-9 eye-opener at
Michigan last week. Consider it payback for 1902, the year Michigan
nipped Iowa, 107-0. Quarterback Brad Banks ranks third nationally in
pass efficiency, which comes as news to Big Ten schools who recruited
Banks to play defensive back.</TE>
<TE>   Fast fact: Did you know this is the first time Iowa has ever
defeated Michigan and Penn State in the same season?</TE>
<TE>   Some bad news: Iowa and Ohio State are undefeated in conference
but don't meet this year because of a Big Ten schedule rotation
system that also didn't have Ohio State and Northwestern paired in
1996, the year those schools tied for the conference title.</TE>
<TE>   National title hopes? Iowa picked the wrong year to have one
defeat, but would gladly settle for fresh-cut roses.</TE>
<TE>   * North Carolina State (9-0): No more jokes about this school's
schedule, only to respectfully note the Wolfpack has defeated two
Division I-AA teams while the other seven victories were logged
against major college teams with an aggregate record of 23-37.
Listen, North Carolina State is taking enough grief in the BCS
standings with its 85th strength-of-schedule mark.</TE>
<TE>   Who wouldn't want to be 9-0? Only Miami (29) and Bowling Green
(10) have won more consecutive games and North Carolina State
quarterback Philip Rivers leads the nation in passing.</TE>
<TE>   The most fascinating statistic, however, belongs to freshman
running back T.A. McLendon, who has 492 rushing yards and nine
touchdowns in the three games -- Texas Tech, North Carolina, Clemson
-- in which he has vomited on the sidelines. It's a nervous reflex
that dates back years. Word is, fans at McLendon's high school games
wouldn't rest until the star put his head in a bucket.</TE>
<TE>   National title hopes? North Carolina State is 14.04 points out of
the No. 2 bowl championship series spot. In outer space terminology,
that's the equivalent of 14.04 light years.</TE>
<TE>   * Georgia (8-0): That Uga-goes-to-Washington-last-summer story is
true. While the homeless lined up for lunch at area shelters,
Georgia's famous bulldog mascot ate roast beef out of the hands of
U.S. senators. When Uga barked during a speech, some said it was the
most intelligent thing emanating from the caucus room in years.</TE>
<TE>   Uga's lobbying efforts have paid off handsomely on the field, as
No. 5 Georgia is poised to win its first Southeastern Conference
title in 20 years. The only annual hang-up is this week's game
against Florida, which has won 11 of the last 12. That was then, this
is now, and no school was happier to see Steve Spurrier scratch his
NFL itch than Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   National title hopes? Very real. The Bulldogs are No. 4 in the BCS
and only a couple chess moves removed from having a roast-beef-eating
dawg in this hunt.</TE>
<TE>   * Bowling Green: (7-0): Report from research department: It's the
one in Ohio, located on a map about halfway between football powers
Michigan and Ohio State. The coach is Urban Meyer, who may become
Urban Legend if he keeps squeezing wins out of this rock. The Falcons
are doomed in the Big Picture because they play in the non-BCS
Mid-American Conference, yet have done all they can do with the
nonconference schedule, having defeated the last five BCS opponents
they have faced.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer has led Bowling Green to a best-ever No. 18 ranking in this
week's coaches' poll, ahead of Florida State, Penn State, Florida and
Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike coaches at those schools, though, Meyer has to sell his
school like soap. The team hasn't had more than 22,000 fans for any
home game this year, forcing Meyer to pen a letter asking students to
buy tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, if these kids don't fork over some pizza money, the next
letter Meyer signs may be at the bottom of a Big Ten contract.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   Never has the BCS faced a more critical stretch to its survival
than the next five weeks. And, trust me, there are powers within that
privately hope full-blown chaos will trigger an accelerated course
toward a playoff. You want worst (or is it best?) case scenarios?
Imagine that five of the six unbeaten schools in the top 10 finish
undefeated and Notre Dame edging out Miami for the No. 2 spot in the
BCS. That would leave a BCS national title game between Oklahoma and
Notre Dame, with Miami, No. 1 in both polls, possibly playing
undefeated North Carolina State for the Associated Press title in the
Orange Bowl. Meanwhile, Georgia could cap a perfect season by winning
the Sugar Bowl while Ohio State could end up 14-0 if it wins the Rose
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny," Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said of the
national title race, "It shakes out every year, but it's mighty
hairy. They'll be somebody upset, you know that."</TE>
<TE>   Tip-toeing around giants: Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany
acknowledged he has not disciplined Penn State Coach Joe Paterno this
year for run-ins with officials because, well, he's Joe Paterno. "If
anyone has earned the benefit of the doubt, I would think Paterno has
earned it over the years," Delany told USA Today and a few other
reporters this week at the Big Ten basketball media day in Chicago.
Last weekend, during Penn State's 13-7 defeat, Paterno touched an
official while seeking clarification of a disputed call, the second
time this season the legendary Nittany Lions' coach has made contact
with a referee.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with Delany's deference to Paterno is it has given
other Big Ten coaches almost free rein to lash out -- Northwestern's
Randy Walker, to name one -- without fear of reprisal. Delany has
been forced to give all his coaches more latitude and has only asked
them to use "good judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Delany is in a tough spot, and it only figures to get tougher.</TE>
<TE>   Call a plumber: Miami's defense has given up 659 rushing yards in
its last two victories, against Florida State and West Virginia,
deplorable for a defensive front once considered to be the nation's
best. In five previous games, no opponent had gained more than 163
rushing yards.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no sky falling here as far as the run defense," Miami
Coach Larry Coker said. "We'll do what we need to do to fix it." With
Notre Dame trailing Miami by only .33 in the BCS, Miami needs to fix
it fast.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado has done it again, recovering from a 1-2 start to stand
6-2 overall and 4-0 in the Big 12 Conference's North Division. Last
year, the Buffaloes lost their opener and nearly made it to the
national title game. Gary Barnett's teams at Colorado have gone 7-9
in August-September games and 12-4 in October. The Buffaloes'
comeback makes this week's trip to BCS No. 1 Oklahoma all the more
interesting in that Colorado is an astounding 8-0-1 against Oklahoma
since 1988 and hasn't lost at Norman since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado tailback Chris Brown, the nation's leading rusher, needs
to average 174.3 yards in his last four games to break the 2,000
mark.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State, a final tribute? The Seminoles have lost seven
games the last two seasons after losing only 17 in the previous 14.
From 1987 through 2000, Florida State never finished lower than fifth
in the final AP poll. Bowden: "I think one of these days we'll look
back and say, 'I don't know how we did it.' "</TE>

1   OKLAHOMA  (7-0)       Sooners not thrilled about having to share
                          this week's top spot with "Jackass, the
                          Movie."
2   MIAMI (7-0)           School is only 18 shy of tying Oklahoma's

4   GEORGIA  (8-0)        Haven't heard of an offensive Southern

7   TEXAS  (7-1)          Longhorns have a roper's chance of getting

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Sawyer a Charter Member of Fight Club</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BOSTON -- Fights during games have decreased thus far this season.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, everyone seems to be waiting for Mighty Duck left wing Kevin
Sawyer to come to town.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday in Edmonton: George Laraque fought Sawyer after the Ducks
scored a goal. It was Laraque's first fight of the season.</LD>
<TE>   Monday in Toronto: Tie Domi and Sawyer scrapped in what was Domi's
first fight.</TE>
<TE>   It was also the Maples Leafs' first fighting major of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday in Montreal: Stephane Quintal picked up the Canadiens'
first fighting major when he battled Sawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Little wonder why Sawyer ranks second in the NHL with 53 penalty
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at the stats and saw George had only eight penalty
minutes, so he hadn't fought yet," Sawyer said. "Then we got to
Toronto and saw Tie hadn't fought yet. So I figured both times there
was a good chance."</TE>
<TE>   Fighting is slightly down this season, from 1.4 fighting majors a
game last season to 1.3 through Monday's games. The faster faceoffs
and the crackdown on obstruction are two reasons given for the drop
in fights.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is any time to fight now," Duck General
Manager Bryan Murray said. "What happened before between faceoffs,
players had a chance to go back and forth with each other. The
increase in penalties for obstruction means there is less of a need
for it. Before, good players were being confronted and held up, so
the protectors felt they had to go protect."</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer sees that the enforcer role is changing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 10 years ago, you could get away with just being an
enforcer in this league," Sawyer said. "That's not true now. You have
to be able to play defense, skate and check.</TE>
<TE>   "Ice time is too important to a guy in my spot to just get into
fights."</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring that point is Sawyer's ability to draw penalties,
which he has done in each of the Ducks' last three games.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like getting an assist for a guy like me," Sawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will see two former teammates tonight, Marty McInnis and
Steve Shields.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis spent most of four seasons with the Ducks before being
traded to Boston last March. "I think it will be fun to see the
guys," McInnis said. "It's going to be a good time."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis, who was born in Massachusetts and played at Boston

<DH>Ebell has been sold short his whole life, and he wasn't
happy about waiting his turn at UCLA, but now he's the man</DH>

<LD>The tiny kid with the dancing eyes and mischievous grin dashes down
the Ventura pier and through the door of a seafood restaurant. He
grabs a mint from a tray next to the cash register and bolts back to
the beach.</LD>
<LD>   He runs two miles on the sand until he reaches his taskmaster
father and hands him the mint. The small crime is repeated daily
until the tiny kid becomes as much a product of operant conditioning
as Pavlov's dogs.</LD>
<LD>   He runs. He eludes capture. He grabs the prize. He runs some more.</LD>
<TE>   His reward? Stature.</TE>
<TE>   It's all Tyler Ebell has ever pursued. The tiny kid has grown up
to become UCLA's tailback as a redshirt freshman even though, at 5
feet 9, 170 pounds, he has been labeled too small so often that the
words elicit another conditioned response -- belligerence.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder he identifies with Mighty Mouse, sporting a tattoo of
the rodent superhero delivering an uppercut that he got at a Ventura
Hell's Angels hangout at 14. Ebell relishes being the fruit fly in
your face, the groundhog in your garden, the possum raiding the dog
food in the dead of night, an annoyance impervious to eradication.</TE>
<TE>   In four games, he has confounded some of the finest pest control
experts in college football -- coaches Dennis Erickson of Oregon
State, Mike Bellotti of Oregon, Jeff Tedford of California and Buddy
Teevens of Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (5-3) won only two of the games against those Pacific 10
Conference opponents, struggling with injuries and play-calling. But
for Ebell, October marked an uninterrupted ascent.</TE>
<TE>   He cracked the lineup in the second quarter against Oregon State
on Oct. 5 because of an injury to Manuel White and rushed for 203
yards, the second-highest total by a Bruin freshman. Three more
100-yard games followed, giving him an average of 146 yards per game
for the month.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell is 72 yards from breaking the UCLA freshman record for yards
in a season (703, by Eric Ball in 1985) and is on pace to reach 1,200
yards. It's still a far cry from his senior year at Ventura High,
when he put up some of the best rushing numbers in the history of
high school football, setting a national record with 4,494 yards and
a state-record 64 touchdowns, but it's more than nearly every
so-called expert expected.</TE>
<TE>   Most college coaches recruited Ebell as "an athlete," rather than
as a tailback and planned to convert him to defensive back or
receiver. UCLA promised he would be a tailback, but Coach Bob Toledo
admits he did not expect Ebell to become an every-down ballcarrier
durable enough to get 39 carries, as he did against Stanford on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Impatient and impetuous, Ebell can't fathom why he began the
season fifth-string. Why anyone would doubt his ability. Why anyone
would discount him because of his size.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really understand why it took so long to get me some
time," he said. "I felt I could have contributed earlier."</TE>
<TE>   He knew all along what is obvious to everyone now.</TE>
<TE>   "He's better running between the tackles than I gave him credit
for, he's done a great job of that," Toledo said. "He does everything
we want a back to do. He's proven it to everybody. He's energized our
offense.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we'd have to use him as a situational,
substitution-type guy and isolate him. Funny how things work out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first person to believe in Ebell was his father. No surprise
there, but conviction became obsession for Dennis Ebell, an ex-Marine
and semi-pro football player.</TE>
<TE>   His son soon was programmed to believe in himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd wake up in the morning and there would be a quote hanging in
my face, like 'It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the
size of the fight in the dog,' " Ebell said. "He expected a lot out
of me, but he always made me believe I could do anything."</TE>
<TE>   He lived alone with Dennis, although he is close to his mother,
Karen Hewlett, who also is in Ventura. Ebell's friends were
astonished when his father required him to do 50 pushups before he
could go out to play.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the two of us, and we grew up like Spartans," Dennis said.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell began playing youth football and always included his jersey
number with his signature.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd sign my birthday and Mother's Day cards, 'Tyler Ebell, No.
2.' " Karen said.</TE>
<TE>   Call it a Napoleon complex, but he all the while he had his sights
set on No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore at Ventura he led the Channel League in rushing
with 1,200 yards, but was voted second-team all-league.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time I believed I was slighted," he said. "That
really made me mad. I kept the all-league team posted in my bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   Every game day he ate a turkey and provolone deli sandwich and
watched video of Walter Payton and Barry Sanders. During the summer,
he ran with his linemen on the beach in their shoes, grabbing mints
to prove to Dennis that they'd made it all the way to the pier.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of Ebell's senior year, that single-minded drive had
propelled him to 7,285 yards rushing and what was then a state-record
111 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   He counted every yard, asking reporters on the sideline about his
total during games and begging his coach not to remove him until he
had eclipsed 300 -- which he did 10 times.</TE>
<TE>   "The main goal is winning, always, but numbers matter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere along the way, behind the mischievous grin and dancing
eyes, Ebell became outspoken. Maybe it's an inevitable part of the
package for an undersized player whose aspirations are sky high.</TE>
<TE>   When others do not share his faith in himself, he seethes. Even
though he is in the lineup now, he can't forget that it took his
entire redshirt season and four games this year to get an
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   It also bothers him that coaches said he was a fumble risk early
in the season, especially as a punt returner. He muffed a punt
against Stanford when a teammate was blocked into him a split second
before the ball arrived, and he bristled when asked about it during a
news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "For the record, I did not fumble," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis speaks his mind as well, although he regrets posting
messages critical of Bruin coaches on an Internet board.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been good to Tyler at UCLA, we were just frustrated it
took so long for him to contribute," Dennis said. "It was a long year
and a half. I don't believe he was getting a look."</TE>
<TE>   Washington, which UCLA plays Saturday, is among the colleges that
did not recruit Ebell as a running back. He uses the memory as
motivation, much like the all-league snub so long ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I like proving to those coaches that didn't give me a chance that
I can run," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Watch Ebell scurry through a hole and his longtime infatuation
with Mighty Mouse makes perfect sense. He began watching reruns of
the cartoon when somebody gave him the nickname after a youth game.</TE>
<TE>   He got the tattoo as a high school freshman with the blessing of
his father as a reward for making the honor roll and rushing for
1,000 yards for the junior varsity. That's also the year he began
wearing the Mighty Mouse T-shirt under his jersey that he wears
today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so small now that I had to cut out the neck and arms," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell has saved the day twice for UCLA -- rushing for 363 yards in
victories over Oregon State and Stanford -- but he might want to
update his icon.</TE>
<TE>   He creates commotion and emerges unscathed in the manner of the
21st century cartoon rodent from the movie, "Lilo and Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   Stitch, an unruly four-armed alien with outsized incisors, is run
over by a large truck and escapes injury. Likewise, Ebell has never
been injured. Not in college, high school or youth league.</TE>
<TE>   "All the things people say about small guys -- injuries, fumbles
-- none of it has applied to me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He has not dropped the ball in 135 carries this season. In 401
carries his senior year at Ventura he fumbled once -- and a teammate
recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   His lack of height works in his favor.</TE>
<TE>   "His pad level is low and guys don't get a shot at the ball,"
Bruin offensive coordinator Kelly Skipper said.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell understands there are advantages to being short, but he
still yearns to grow in the eyes of others. In the UCLA team photo,
he is standing in the second row beside 5-9 cornerback Ricky Manning.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on my tiptoes," Ebell said gleefully. "That's why I look so
much taller than Ricky."</TE>
<TE>   And he's gaining stature with every carry.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Giddy About Future</HD>
<DH>With the rare luxury of returning everyone and the '03 MLS
Cup in its stadium, team likes its chances to defend title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the moment the Galaxy completed a regular season that included
the team winning Major League Soccer's Western Conference
championship, team captain Cobi Jones made a promise to himself, the
media and all interested observers.</LD>
<LD>   During the Galaxy's postseason run, he would not talk about the
team's past shortcomings in the MLS Cup title match.</LD>
<LD>   It was a sensitive topic to be sure. Though the Galaxy was,
percentage-wise, the seven-year-old league's most successful team, in
three previous MLS Cup championships, the team was woebegone and
winless, losing in 1996, 1999 and 2001.</LD>
<TE>   So Jones stayed true to his word, reminding his teammates of the
task at hand while writing inspirational affirmations on locker room
chalkboards and keeping the team on an even keel after both playoff
series wins.</TE>
<TE>   Not so much as a bottle of champagne was popped in the Galaxy's
Invesco Field locker room after it swept the Colorado Rapids to
clinch a spot in the championship.</TE>
<TE>   But after the Galaxy exorcised its title-game demons with a
sudden-death, 1-0 victory over the New England Revolution in the
title match, Jones let it all out in the Galaxy's victory
celebration, a rally that drew an estimated 7,500 and nearly filled
Staples Center's lower bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't have done it without you fans," the normally low-key
Jones screamed into the microphone. "You've been there for us since
the beginning and now we can say that we're the 2002 champs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have everything in our favor now and in 2003, the Cup has to
come through L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The champions will have the opportunity to defend the title on its
home field as the Galaxy's still-under-construction, 27,000-seat
stadium at the Home Depot National Training Center in Carson is
scheduled to open in June and host both the MLS All-Star game and MLS
Cup next year.</TE>
<TE>   And why shouldn't the Galaxy repeat?</TE>
<TE>   In the single-entity MLS, the Galaxy has the rare luxury of
bringing back every player from this year's team, which finished with
the best regular-season record in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's out of contract so that's the beauty of it. We have that
option," Galaxy General Manager Doug Hamilton said. "It's not a
situation where we don't have to beg people to come here."</TE>
<TE>   Plus, only four players -- Jones, Mauricio Cienfuegos, Ezra
Hendrickson and Alexi Lalas -- are over 30.</TE>
<TE>   "We're coming off several different platforms to excite the
community," Hamilton said. "We're coming off a championship, which
everybody loves. We're moving into a new building, which everybody
loves. And we have the league MVP, which everybody loves.</TE>
<TE>   "These things give us some degree of confidence but regardless of
any of that, our job is to get better. We are not going to sit still.
That's not an option."</TE>
<TE>   After the World Cup, the Galaxy made it known that it planned on
fielding a Korean player in 2003 to whet the Korean community's
appetite.</TE>
<TE>   The organization can only hope it strikes gold in Asia as it did
in signing Carlos Ruiz last winter.</TE>
<TE>   All the Guatemalan striker did was lead the league in goals (a
franchise-record 24), set MLS postseason records for goals (eight)
and points (18) and win the league's most-valuable-player award while
bucking the Galaxy's mediocre record of bringing in international
forwards.</TE>
<TE>   At the Galaxy's championship rally, Ruiz, who turned 23 on Sept.
15 and scored the title-match winner, took his turn on the microphone
to address the heavily Latino crowd.</TE>
<TE>   With the crowd screaming, Ruiz led an arena-wide sing-along of his
hometown team's fight song, substituting "Galaxy" for "Municipal."</TE>
<TE>   This, of course, was after he collected on a bet with Lalas, who
promised his young ward a new watch if Ruiz scored 15 goals.</TE>
<TE>   With Lalas in a wedding and absent from the rally, Peter Vagenas,
Ruiz's first Galaxy roommate, did the honors, presenting Ruiz with a
Rolex from Lalas.</TE>
<TE>   "theseQue hora es?" Ruiz asked the gathering. What time is it?</TE>
<TE>   According to Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid, it's time for his team to
start collecting MLS titles.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting the first one, there was great satisfaction and a little
bit of relief," said Schmid, who won three national championships at
UCLA but was zero for his first two in the MLS Cup with the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   "The next time we play for the title, we don't have to worry about
those questions [about losing the final] and we can just focus."</TE>
<TE>   In a raucous celebration in which the players fought their way
through yellow and teal streamers in a victory lap around Staples
Center to share the championship trophy with the fans, the Galaxy
felt the love.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just enjoying this, letting it all soak in," Jones said.
"It's nice to be able to put all of that in the past now and not have
to worry about all those other championship games and to sort it all
out with this last one. We finally came through."</TE>

<LD>Megan Chavez scored a goal in each half Wednesday night in Victoria,
Canada, and Costa Rica defeated Jamaica, 2-0, in the CONCACAF Women's
Gold Cup soccer tournament.</LD>

<HD>Santa Anita on Krone's Comeback Trail</HD>
<DH>Hall of Fame jockey will race Saturday in California Cup on
her second day after returning to competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There will be something different this year about the California Cup,
which will be run for the 13th time Saturday at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   It isn't the size of the fields. Plenty of California breds enter
the 10 races and that's true again in 2002. A total of 110 horses
were entered Wednesday morning, topped by an overflow 17 in the
$150,000 California Cup Distaff.</LD>
<LD>   What is new is a certain jockey. Julie Krone, the winningest
female rider in history with 3,545 victories and a member of racing's
Hall of Fame, will make her debut in the popular event on her second
day back in the saddle.</LD>
<TE>   Krone, 39, who announced almost two weeks ago that she was making
a comeback, is scheduled for three races Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In the second, the $150,000 Matron at 1 1/16 miles, she will ride
contender Cee's Elegance for trainer Doug O'Neill, then is named on
longshot First Draft for trainer Jack Van Berg in the $100,000
Distance Handicap at 1 1/4 miles on the turf. First Draft finished
third in Wednesday's seventh race, so it seems extremely unlikely she
will run again Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Krone, who has been working horses regularly since July, then has
first call on also-eligible Mabel Kent in the $150,000 Distaff at
about 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Her second call, Yes We Do, is in the body of the race. Both are
trained by Ian Jory.</TE>
<TE>   Krone will have a little warmup on Friday. She is named on
first-time starter Justly Royal in the fifth, a 6 1/2-furlong turf
race for 2-year-old maiden fillies.</TE>
<TE>   A daughter of 1990 Breeders' Cup Mile winner Royal Academy, Justly
Royal is owned by the T N T Stud and trained by Richard Mandella, a
fellow Hall of Famer who hired her to work horses during the summer
Del Mar meet.</TE>
<TE>   "I already feel like I'm back because I've been working horses in
the mornings and hustling and talking to people," said Krone, who
retired April 19, 1999, after winning three races at Lone Star Park
that day. "After 20 years, you fall back into a groove."</TE>
<TE>   The richest event of Cal Cup Day, the $250,000 Classic at 1 1/8
miles, drew 10, headed by 3-1 morning line favorite Hot Market.</TE>
<TE>   Bred and co-owned by John Harris and trained by Craig Lewis, the
4-year-old Cee's Tizzy gelding has won five of 14 and three of seven
at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Second to Disturbingthepeace in the Pat O'Brien Handicap at Del
Mar more than two months ago, Hot Market will be making his first
start at the Classic distance.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the entrants, Eric Da Bomb and Grey Memo, are holdovers
from last year. A 5-year-old Flying Victor gelding, Eric Da Bomb
finished fifth after setting the pace at 22-1 while Grey Memo, whose
biggest victory came in the Godolphin Mile this year in Dubai, was
sixth. Grey Memo, who will have a new rider in Alex Solis, is the 4-1
second choice on Jeff Tufts' line.</TE>
<TE>   From the inside out, here's the rest of the Classic field: Groom
On The Run, Earl Of Danby, Slippery When Bet, Bonus Pay Day, Calkins
Road, Continental Red and Long Gone Con.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Baffert, who leads all trainers with seven Cal Cup wins,
doesn't have a runner in the Classic, but he entered Martinblestme in
the $125,000 Juvenile, Stormy Jack in the $150,000 Sprint and
Servaline and Small Town Girl in the $125,000 Juvenile Fillies.</TE>

<LD>No. 1 singles player Christine Dao has returned to the Granada Hills
girls' tennis team after a 12-3 vote last week by teammates allowed
her to return to the team in midseason after she decided to skip the
season to concentrate on schoolwork.</LD>
<LD>   Dao, a junior ranked No. 39 in the U.S. Tennis Assn. girls' 18
division, has played for Granada Hills (11-0, 8-0) in the
Highlanders' last three matches and makes the Highlanders a City
Section title contender.</LD>
<LD>   "[The vote] was a pretty strong indication that the team wanted
her back," Coach Ron Wood said. "I had second thoughts myself, but
they didn't. She's come back, and it's like she never left."</LD>
<TE>   Carson, which has two ranked players, and Granada Hills have met
in the City Section championship match the last three seasons, with
Granada Hills winning in 1999 and Carson winning the last two years,
all by 4-3 margins.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have a real chance," Wood said. "Without her, we didn't.
With her, we do."</TE>

<TE>   There were a record number of sub-16-minute clockings by boys and
sub-19-minute efforts by girls in the Mount San Antonio College
Invitational cross-country meet last week.</TE>
<TE>   One-hundred and thirty-one boys broke 16 minutes and 97 girls
dipped under 19 on the 2.91-mile course that has been in use at Mt.
SAC since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The previous high totals of 108 boys and 69 girls were recorded in
the 2000 Mt. SAC Invitational.</TE>

<TE>   Thousand Oaks, The Times' No. 4-ranked girls' cross-country team,
won the individual sweepstakes title in the Mount San Antonio College
Invitational on Saturday, but none of the Lancers' top runners are
expected to compete in the Ventura County championships at Lake
Casitas on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   That's because Coach Robert Radnoti wants to make sure his team is
not over-raced heading into the last month of the season.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Ventura is now favored to win the Ventura County title with
its strongest challenges expected to come from defending champion
Simi Valley Royal and Oak Park.</TE>

<LD>   Anaheim Katella (7-0, 2-0) vs. Orange Lutheran (5-2, 2-0) at Brea
Olinda HS, 7, tonight</LD>
<LD>   Katella, ranked No. 5 in the Southern Section's Division VI poll,
has three shutouts this season and has allowed seven points or less
in five games. Brandon Barnes and Kevin Stout have seven
interceptions each, a big part of the 26 turnovers forced by the
defense and special teams. Barnes has been the main target for
quarterback Tony Savala, catching 25 passes for 377 yards and five
touchdowns. Orange Lutheran, ranked No. 4 in Division VI, saw its
high-powered offense suffer a setback when running back John Ausmus
broke his leg last week against Placentia Valencia and is out for the
season.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chino Hills Ayala (6-1, 1-0) at Chino (7-0, 2-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Both teams may be hindered by injuries in this Sierra League
showdown. Ayala quarterback Colin McNeil is questionable with a
slightly separated shoulder that caused him to sit out last week
during the No. 21 Bulldogs' 21-6 victory over Glendora. Jacob Flowe,
running back for No. 2 Chino, is still nursing a sore ankle that
limited his playing time last week during the Cowboys' 26-21 victory
over La Verne Damien. If McNeil is unable to play, the Bulldogs will
turn to a more run-oriented attack led by Corey Tello (451 yards
rushing) and Bobby Meza (360), who is also a threat as a receiver and
kick returner. Kes Ekpre-Olomo, who rushed for 186 yards last week,
can carry the load for Chino.</TE>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *Hacienda Heights Los Altos (6-1, 1-0) at Covina Charter Oak (6-1,
1-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   If recent history is any indication, the stakes in this game are
self-evident: In the last two years, the winner has won the Miramonte
League title and the Southern Section Division VII championship.
Charter Oak, No. 18 in The Times' rankings this season, won last
year's game and No. 11 Los Altos won in 2000. Though the teams now
play in Division VI, the same could happen again. Los Altos is No. 1
in the division poll and Charter Oak is No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Springs Santa Fe (5-2, 2-0) at Whittier Pioneer (7-0,
2-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   It's not just a game with Del Rio League title implications -- it
will also determine the top team in the Southern Section Division VII
rankings and give the winner the inside track to the division's top
playoff seeding. Pioneer, currently No. 1, is led by Ricky Reyes, who
has rushed for 919 yards in 98 carries -- an average of 9.4 yards per
carry -- and has scored 13 touchdowns. Santa Fe's Adam Sandoval has
840 yards rushing and eight touchdowns, and Dan Banzet has 577 yards
passing with eight touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei (6-1, 2-0) at Anaheim Servite (7-0, 2-0) at
Cal State Fullerton, 7 p.m., Saturday</TE>
<TE>   Servite is off to its best start since it began 8-0 in 1985. The
teams have played every year since Servite fielded its first team in
1960, but Servite hasn't won since 1988. Mater Dei holds a 25-13 edge
in the series and there have been two ties, including 0-0 in 1992.
Servite is ranked No. 8 by The Times and No. 3 in the Division I
poll, and Mater Dei is No. 9 and No. 4, respectively. The winner will
have an inside track on the Serra League title, though both still
must face Bellflower St. John Bosco, also undefeated in league.</TE>

<TE>   CITY SECTION</TE>
<TE>   Fremont (7-0, 2-0) at Crenshaw (4-3, 2-0), 2:15 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Many eyes in the City will be focused on this matchup of title
contenders. Quarterback Michael Beach, with his running and passing
ability, may be the final piece to a championship puzzle for the
high-scoring Pathfinders, No. 12 in The Times' rankings. But they
haven't faced a defense as physical as Crenshaw's. Lineman Brandon
Mebane and cornerback Daymeion Hughes are the anchors of a unit that
hasn't allowed an offensive touchdown in league play. With Andrew
Simpson at quarterback and former quarterback Bryant Thompson moved
to running back, the Cougars' offense has become more diversified.</TE>
<TE>   Gardena (5-2, 2-0) at Wilmington Banning (4-3, 2-0), 6:30 p.m.,
Friday</TE>
<TE>   Improved offense has been one of the keys for the Panthers as they
try to avoid repeating last year's late-season swoon. Quarterback
LaFerrell Payne is in charge of an option attack that averages 29
points. Payne has rushed for 506 yards, and tailback DeAndre Hughes
(454 yards in five games) and fullback Jason Franklin (472 yards) are
the other threats. Banning counters with its veer-option offense,
powered by running backs A.J. Tuitele and Patrick Perry, who
accounted for 236 yards and three touchdowns last week in wearing
down Harbor City Narbonne. The winner figures to stay in a
first-place tie with Carson, which plays winless Washington this
week.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forfeits can change the complexion of a season. Just ask San
Bernardino Aquinas Coach Josh Henderson, whose Falcons recently had
to forfeit all five victories for using an ineligible player.</LD>
<LD>   Aquinas, which last week appeared to be a shoo-in for the Southern
Section Division XII playoffs, is 0-7 and destined not to make it
into the postseason at home.</LD>
<LD>   Forfeits can be nothing more than a minor nuisance. Just ask San
Clemente Coach Eric Patton, whose Tritons defeated Huntington Beach
Edison in their season opener only to learn more than a month later
that they would have to forfeit the victory for failing to submit
paperwork regarding a 14-year-old player. Even with the forfeit loss,
San Clemente is on track for a playoff-qualifying finish in the South
Coast League and a decent draw in the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   Thirteen schools have forfeited football victories this season for
violations ranging from illegal transfers to administrative errors.
While that figure represents an increase from last year, it is not
unusually high, said Thom Simmons, the section's media relations
director.</TE>
<TE>   "There's quite a few new athletic directors this year, and there's
a learning curve there," Simmons said. "Plus there's more rules and
regulations and paperwork that people need to file than there was 10
years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons said his office has fielded several calls from upset
coaches and administrators who say the forfeits needlessly harm their
players because, in many cases, they are the result of an adult's
oversight. Simmons said he reminds them that his office enforces the
rules and that they can appeal to their league representative to
amend the regulations through the section council, which serves as
the legislative body for 537 schools.</TE>
<TE>   Forfeits are problematic when they occur during league play, which
determines playoff entrants. A forfeit that knocked a team from third
to fourth place in a six-team league might determine if it makes the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Forfeits can also affect at-large playoff entries. A team that
fails to receive one of its league's automatic playoff entries must
hope for an at-large bid. But if a nonleague forfeit causes a team's
overall record to fall below .500, it would be ineligible to compete
in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   While San Clemente's forfeit probably won't keep it out of the
playoffs, Patton acknowledged that "it's a blemish on our season. If
anything, it makes the people who manage the football team more
conscious of some of the little things. We will check our records
more closely and follow the procedures next time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Katella is showing what a little devotion can do for an
under-performing program.</TE>
<TE>   The Knights are 7-0 for the first time in school history, Coach
Dominik Unger said, because their seniors and juniors showed a
renewed commitment to staying in shape during the off-season. Players
who wrestled and ran track still made time to lift weights, and those
who didn't made sure they ran and lifted on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most dedicated group I've had," said the sixth-year
coach. "Their dedication to physical strength and quickness is paying
off."</TE>
<TE>   Katella has five offensive linemen who squat more than 400 pounds.
The speedy defense has 20 interceptions and defensive lineman Jose
Herrera has set a single-season school record with 15 sacks. Not bad
for a team that last won a league title in 1968 and has never won a
section title.</TE>
<TE>   The Knights, one of 19 section teams to start 7-0, could hang an
Empire League championship banner in the school gym if they win their
final three regular-season games, including a game against Orange
Lutheran (5-2, 2-0) at 7 tonight at Brea Olinda.</TE>

<TE>   Santa Margarita running back Ashton White and linebacker Dustin
Slinkard are questionable for the Eagles' Serra League game against
Los Angeles Loyola on Saturday at Glendale High.</TE>
<TE>   White, who needs 812 yards to become Santa Margarita's all-time
leading rusher, continues to be hobbled by a knee injury. Slinkard,
who has 64 tackles, two fumble recoveries and two interceptions,
might not play for a second consecutive week because of a hand
injury.</TE>

<TE>   Ribet Academy officials say the Fighting Frogs' 28-0 San Joaquin
League football loss to Anaheim Fairmont Prep should not have been
stopped in the fourth quarter despite several unsportsmanlike conduct
penalties, the ejection of an assistant coach and a parent's removal
from school grounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Fighting Frogs, who are 0-6 and have scored six points all
season, had one of their more competitive efforts last Friday against
Fairmont. The game's head referee, Chris McNeese, stopped the contest
with nine minutes left in the fourth quarter after Ribet Coach Omar
Smalley and his assistants questioned the use of a running clock.</TE>
<TE>   Smalley, a first-year coach, didn't defend any unsportsmanlike
actions of his players or the parent, but he said none of his
assistant coaches were verbally abusive to the referees and he
questioned the need to stop the school's homecoming game. He said he
did not ask for a running clock, something he has done three times
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We were playing one of our best games," Smalley said. "We've
never had a ref do that on his own until that game. Going into the
fourth quarter, to see the clock running was a shock. There was no
explanation from him. I had to ask and I had every right to wonder
why it was running."</TE>
<TE>   McNeese, who is the assigner for the San Gabriel Valley Officials
Assn., did not comment on his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Cuppari, who assigns officials for the San Fernando Valley,
said a referee has the authority to stop a game but often employs a
continuous clock only at the request and approval of both coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "If a score is really bad, the official may go to the losing coach
and ask if he wants to run the clock," Cuppari said. "Usually the
official doesn't do it on his own."</TE>
<TE>   Tempers began to simmer when Fairmont's Justin Harris caught a
30-yard pass and was tackled at the four-yard line as time ran out in
the first half. McNeese ordered two seconds back on the clock in
order to move the first-down chains, and Fairmont's Won Choi scored
on the next play to give the Huskies a 21-0 lead.</TE>

<LD>MICHAEL BUMPUS</LD>
<LD>   School: Culver City Ht.: 6-0 Wt.: 180 Year: Junior</LD>
<LD>   Culver City High wide receiver Michael Bumpus has put up a lot of
impressive numbers this season. He has 38 catches for 667 yards -- an
average of 17.6 yards per catch -- for a team that is 7-0 overall and
2-0 in the Pioneer League.</LD>
<TE>   Yet there is one number that transcends his statistical
contributions on the football field: five.</TE>
<TE>   That's the number of sports the multitalented junior plans to play
this year. In addition to football, Bumpus said he will participate
in soccer and basketball in the winter and track and lacrosse in the
spring. He's already played most of the sports, just never in the
same school year.</TE>
<TE>   In ninth grade, he played on the freshman football team and was a
midfielder and forward on the varsity soccer team, scoring 15 goals.
As a sophomore, he was a starting receiver and free safety on the
varsity football team, a starting guard on the varsity basketball
team (averaging 15 points) and a starting right fielder on the
varsity baseball team (with a batting average around .300).</TE>
<TE>   He also figures to be successful at lacrosse and track because of
his superior speed and hand-eye coordination.</TE>
<TE>   "I love anything that has to do with sports," Bumpus said.</TE>
<TE>   Bumpus' drive to play five sports will necessitate the consent of
a handful of coaches. Football Coach Tom Salter has already given his
blessing.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be all for whatever he wants to do," Salter said. "I
encourage kids to play more than one sport. It's good for the high
school and it's what you should do."</TE>
<TE>   Though he excels at every sport he plays, Bumpus said his
overwhelming favorite is football, where he also displays his talents
as a punter and backup quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "I like playing on Friday nights," said Bumpus, who didn't play
organized football until high school but likely will parlay his skill
in the sport into a college scholarship. "There's a lot of people at
the football games and it's exciting."</TE>
<TE>   This Friday will be particularly thrilling for Bumpus because his
father, Mark, is traveling from his home in Biloxi, Miss., to see his
son play for the first time in high school. Culver City's homecoming
game against Torrance starts at 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Bumpus is also excited about Culver City's matchup with undefeated
league rival El Segundo on Nov. 8 in a game that will likely decide
the league champion.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a big game," Bumpus said. "We've never played each other
[Culver City played in the Bay League until this season], but it's
already being billed as a rivalry."</TE>

<LD>After running in three consecutive Grade I races around two turns,
Tali'sluckybusride is dropping in class and shortening up in her
comeback today at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   A $23,000 purchase more than two years ago by owners Ron and Susie
Anson, the 3-year-old Delineator filly makes her first start since
Feb. 10 in the $75,000-added Cascapedia Stakes at six furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Alfredo Marquez, Tali'sluckybusride, who finished third
in the Hollywood Starlet and Las Virgenes after winning the Oak Leaf,
is the co-third choice at 4-1 in the Cascapedia, which drew seven
other fillies and mares.</LD>
<TE>   The 5-2 morning line favorite in the race is Madame Pietra, who
has three seconds and a victory in her last four starts for trainer
Howard Zucker.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the field in the Cascapedia are Rollette, Imperatriz
Rafaela, Shameful, Brisquette, Refine and Harvest Girl.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: River Bridge will try to bounce back for trainer
Darrell Vienna in the third at Oak Tree, a $50,000 claimer for
fillies and mares at about 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jack Carava. Oak Tree's leading trainer swept the final
three races on Wednesday's card. With four days left in the meet,
Carava has 12 victories, four more than Bob Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Robert O'Connor. With 10 months of the year almost
complete, the Kentucky-based trainer is winless in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta keying Kalookan Star on top in the

<DL></DL>
<LD>CHICAGO -- Welcome back, Ziggy Palffy. Adios, Adam Deadmarsh.</LD>
<LD>   The revolving door to the Kings' training room took another
unexpected swing Wednesday when Coach Andy Murray said that Palffy,
who has been sidelined six of the last seven games because of a
strained left groin, is expected to play tonight against the Chicago
Blackhawks.</LD>
<LD>   Deadmarsh, however, probably will sit out after suffering a right
wrist injury in Sunday's 5-1 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets, then
aggravating the injury in Tuesday night's 4-0 victory over the
Atlanta Thrashers.</LD>
<TE>   Deadmarsh, whose goal Sunday was his fourth in two games, played
less than eight minutes against the Thrashers and wore a wrist brace
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said it was possible he could play tonight, but the coach
drew up a lineup that did not include the rugged winger.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather tell the guys, 'This is how we're going to play
without him,' " Murray said. "Then if he can play, we plug him in and
it's a bonus."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Felix Potvin's shutout Tuesday was his 26th in 572 NHL games, his
12th in 101 games with the Kings. He had a career-high six last
season.... Steve Kelly was recalled from the minors when Jason
Allison was put on injured reserve.</TE>

<TE>   Update -- The Blackhawks made the playoffs last season, ending a
four-year drought, and are off to a strong start this season, but few
in Chicago seem to have noticed. Only 10,203 turned out for Tuesday
night's 3-2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets at the United
Center. Goaltender Jocelyn Thibault picked up his 200th victory.</TE>

<HD>Allison Will Miss 2 Months</HD>
<DH>Knee injury 'could have been worse' for the Kings' leading
scorer, who won't need surgery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CHICAGO -- For Jason Allison and the Kings, the bad news out of
Culver City on Wednesday was actually good.</LD>
<LD>   Or, at least, not as bad as they had initially feared.</LD>
<LD>   An MRI exam on Allison's injured right knee revealed that the
team's scoring leader had suffered a torn medial collateral ligament
and a sprained anterior cruciate ligament in Tuesday night's 4-0
victory over the Atlanta Thrashers.</LD>
<TE>   In layman's terms: The injury, suffered in a violent knee-on-knee
collision with Thrasher defenseman Andy Sutton, is not as serious as
first thought.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, 27, is expected to be sidelined eight to 12 weeks,
keeping him out of the lineup probably into late December and
possibly into late January, the heart of the schedule. He could be
sidelined for nearly 40 games.</TE>
<TE>   But he should be back for the regular season's final two months
and, if the Kings can build on their fast start in his absence, the
playoffs too.</TE>
<TE>   And he won't need surgery. A torn ACL would have required a
complete reconstruction of the knee and would have ended Allison's
season after only nine games. It would have sidelined him for six
months -- or, in reality, 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed in what happened," Allison said from his
Manhattan Beach home in a statement released by the club, "but there
was a chance that it could have been worse, so there is something
positive to take from this."</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, where the Kings will wrap up a five-game trip tonight
against the Chicago Blackhawks, the news was met with a sigh of
relief.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, really good news," captain Mattias Norstrom said. "I
think we're all really happy to hear it. When we saw him last night,
getting on the bus and getting on the plane, it looked really bad....</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the replay today a couple times. It looks ugly. And when I
heard the news it was [only] eight to 12 weeks, you're like, 'Wow.'
He was really lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray gathered the team for a meeting late in the day
to discuss lineup changes and carrying on without Allison, who has
scored 85 points in 82 games since joining the Kings last October in
a trade with the Boston Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great player and you miss great players," Murray said of
Allison, who has 11 points in nine games this season, "but I haven't
even thought about what we're losing. I'm trying to figure out what
we can get from these other guys."</TE>
<TE>   Allison was carrying the puck up the right side of the ice near
the red line midway through the first period Tuesday night when he
tried to sidestep the onrushing Sutton, who at 6 feet 6 and 245
pounds is one of the league's biggest players.</TE>
<TE>   Sutton, however, seemed to stick his leg out as the 6-3, 215-pound
Allison tried to maneuver around him to the inside. Their right knees
slammed together.</TE>
<TE>   Allison fell to the ice, grimacing and clutching his knee.</TE>
<TE>   Helped off the ice, he spent the rest of game in the dressing
room. He flew with the Kings to Chicago after the game, then flew
home Wednesday morning to meet with team physician Robert Kvitne. His
rehabilitation has already started.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, meanwhile, believe that the hit warrants a suspension
for Sutton, even though referees Stephane Auger and Ian Walsh did not
penalize him.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a little angry and upset when you see an injury like that
because hopefully the players have respect for each other," Norstrom
said. "Looking at the replay, I can't really say that Sutton did this
with intent to injure, but it's a pretty dangerous play to step up at
someone like that."</TE>

<HD>Shaq Won't Lighten Up in Feud With Walton</HD>

<LD>PORTLAND, Ore. -- Shaquille O'Neal stepped around Bill Walton in the
cramped locker room at the Rose Garden, and spat a profanity at him.</LD>
<LD>   For days O'Neal had groused about comments Walton, the out-there
ESPN broadcaster, had made about his weight.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night, face to face with the Hall of Fame center,
O'Neal growled at Walton, "I ain't no peon. You better watch your
mouth."</LD>
<TE>   Walton, interviewing Kobe Bryant, did not respond. Later, Walton
said, "All I ask the players is to listen to what I say, not what
someone told them I said."</TE>
<TE>   Walton's point, he said, was that O'Neal's foot and toe injuries
might not be so severe if O'Neal were lighter, and that he'd be a
better player as well.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he weighs 342 pounds and his body fat is 17%.
Recovering from Sept. 11 toe surgery, he recently began a light
running program.</TE>
<TE>   "He talks too much," O'Neal said. "Don't act like you're my friend
and then talk derogatory about me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The luxury tax is coming and, as currently configured, with 14
players and a payroll of about $63 million, the Lakers could be more
than $10 million beyond the threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Jerry Buss previously had been adamant about living within
the means defined by the luxury tax for what he called the fiscal
health of the game. He laughed when asked how he settled in his mind
the spike in salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more about settling it in my pocketbook," he said, smiling,
on opening night. "I cry. I try to borrow money from Kobe and Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is this: I'm pretty well geared to live by those
rules, because quite honestly there won't be a game without those
rules. The thing that threw a wrench into the works was that
television revenues decreased instead of increased at their normal
rate.... We were out there on a limb and we had no choice. I really
could not see letting Devean George go."</TE>
<TE>   Said George: "That's good, because I didn't want to go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who wore Nike shoes in six of eight exhibition games, has
worn Nike in both regular-season games. He does not have a shoe
contract and is believed to be considering Reebok along with Nike....
O'Neal and his girlfriend, Shaunie, are expecting a boy in May. It
would be the couple's third child together. Bryant and his wife,
Vanessa, are expecting a girl in February.</TE>

<HD>Road Gets No Easier for Lakers</HD>
<DH>Trail Blazers blow them out, 102-90, for a rare 0-2 start.
Bryant, George suffer sprained ankles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PORTLAND, Ore. -- They'd call it one lousy quarter, the second, when
they were outscored by 22 points and Kobe Bryant and Devean George
sprained their ankles.</LD>
<LD>   It was, and now it's two lousy nights, two lousy games, too little
Bryant, and no Shaquille O'Neal at all.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant and George limped away from a 102-90 loss to the Portland
Trail Blazers on Wednesday night at the Rose Garden, and so the
Lakers are 0-2 for the first time in 12 years, they've played well
for about a quarter and a half in two games, and at this rate they'll
be out of athletic tape by Thanksgiving.</LD>
<TE>   "How many did I say?" Phil Jackson asked afterward with a thin
grin.</TE>
<TE>   Seven.</TE>
<TE>   "Right," the coach said.</TE>
<TE>   He'd said they could start 0-7, his annual reach for candor and
patience and perspective, and then Bryant's right foot landed atop
Ruben Patterson's shoe after a jump shot in the second quarter, and
then George, a replacement for the suspended Rick Fox, turned his
left ankle four minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt a lot of crunching," Bryant said. "I just tried to relax.
I knew from experience if I could walk off the court and put some
pressure on it, I felt like I could come back in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant did, but it was all but lost in the three-plus minutes he
was in the locker room, as many of the Lakers took that opportunity
to go to stone. They turned a 26-23 lead into a 36-29 deficit without
Bryant. So emboldened, the Trail Blazers led by 22 points just before
halftime, by 23 points late in the third quarter, and by 24 points
before Trail Blazer Coach Maurice Cheeks took mercy on them all.</TE>
<TE>   "They got momentum," Jackson said. "We got confused."</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers had to win, of course. If they'd lost with
O'Neal on the bench and Bryant on one leg, owner Paul Allen would've
had to sell off the franchise, $104-million bit by $104-million bit.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant limped to the bus, 20 paces or so behind George. The Lakers
play again Friday against the Clippers, and both players said they
expected to participate, but it's too soon to tell.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hurting pretty bad right now," said Bryant, who did not play
the final 7:21.</TE>
<TE>   George arrived with a sore right ankle, turned during the final
exhibition game and aggravated in Tuesday night's loss to San
Antonio. Then he landed awkwardly beneath the Laker basket, and
trainer Gary Vitti led him, too, to the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "Our younger players, and our older players even, just couldn't
match the athleticism of the Blazers," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Rasheed Wallace scored 28 points and Damon Stoudamire scored 16
for the Trail Blazers. Bryant had 25 points, 11 in the first quarter,
and Slava Medvedenko scored 15 in 23 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers aren't really much for fall anyway, being more winter
and spring types when it comes to basketball, and when they awoke in
Portland on Wednesday morning the temperature was in the mid-30s and
the leaves on the trees were scarlet and gold.</TE>
<TE>   Still, predicting early losses is one thing, experiencing them
quite another, particularly for a proud team bent on its fourth
consecutive championship. While the Lakers bore expressions of
boredom with the whole topic of early failure, neither could they
completely set it aside.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll get a win on Friday," Jackson offered.</TE>
<TE>   He'd probably like to know that the last team to win the NBA title
after losing its first two games was the 1990-91 Chicago Bulls, his
first champion.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to figure out a way to get a win in the next few
games," guard Derek Fisher said, "get that off our backs, then just
look forward to keeping guys healthy and in game conditions and not
be too hard on ourselves to expect too much at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes into the second quarter, Bryant fell to the floor and
held his right ankle. He had missed a jump shot and landed on
Patterson's foot, and now it was Patterson standing above him, his
hand out. Earlier in the week, Patterson had again touted his defense
against Bryant. Bryant took his hand Wednesday, but bristled
afterward about who's stopping whom these days.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't play one-on-one basketball," he said. "You want to play
one-on-one, he can holler at me in the off-season. We'll go down to
Rucker [Park, in Harlem]."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "That's so 1996 for me," he said.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Leaves 'Em Laughing in Toronto</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan played so poorly that people laughed at him.</LD>
<LD>   Morris Peterson scored 20 points and Jordan went scoreless in the
second half -- and even missed a dunk -- and the Toronto Raptors
opened their season with a 74-68 victory over the Washington Wizards
on Wednesday night at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, coming off the bench, scored eight points in 25 minutes,
missing 10 of 14 shots. After missing two free throws with 4:06 left,
he missed a breakaway dunk as the ball clanged off the back rim. The
crowd laughed at Jordan, who turns 40 in February.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm pretty sure everybody is going to look at the one play,"
Jordan said. "I felt like I exploded pretty good. I got hit on the
knee, but I still should have finished it. Other than that I felt
good."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Vince Carter had 18 points in his first game since
surgery on his left knee in March.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse had a team-high 19 points for the Wizards, and
Kwame Brown had a career-high 18 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 100, Utah 75 -- Baron Davis had 21 points and 10
assists in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 17,668 at New
Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first regular-season NBA game in New Orleans since the
Jazz left for Utah in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 106, San Antonio 98 -- Antawn Jamison scored 36
points and Jason Richardson had 22 at Oakland, and the Warriors won
in Eric Musselman's coaching debut.</TE>
<TE>   Jamison scored 15 of his points in the first half. Tim Duncan had
24 points and nine rebounds for San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 100, Miami 86 -- The Magic improved to 2-0 for the first
time since 1993, taking advantage of the Heat's sputtering offense
and defensive breakdowns at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady scored 24 points and Grant Hill had 17 for the
Magic, which shot 55% from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 86, New York 77 -- Richard Hamilton scored 22 points in
his Piston debut and Detroit's depth wore down the injury-depleted
Knicks at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Houston scored 31 points and helped New York lead by as many
as 12 points in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 119, Memphis 108 -- Steve Nash scored 24 points at Memphis,
Tenn., to lead the Mavericks to their eighth consecutive victory over
the Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Gordan Giricek scored 29 points for Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 83, Denver 77 -- Newcomer Troy Hudson scored 23 points
for the banged-up Timberwolves at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets went on a 22-4 run and took advantage of poor
Minnesota shooting to pull to within 70-63 after three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 99, Boston 96 -- Trenton Hassell scored eight of his 14
points in the last three minutes, including two three-pointers, to
twice give the Bulls the lead at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Boston's Antoine Walker had 14 points and 11 rebounds, but made
only five of 23 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 95, Milwaukee 93 -- Allen Iverson had 28 points,
including a go-ahead jumper in the final minute, to lead the 76ers at
home.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Allen scored 28 points for Milwaukee, but missed a long jumper
and turned the ball over in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 105, Atlanta 94 -- Jason Kidd had 16 points, 12 assists
and eight rebounds to lead the Nets at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 86, Phoenix 73 -- Brent Barry had eight of his 25 points
in the fourth quarter to lead the SuperSonics at Seattle.</TE>

still a laughingstock. When he left last summer, they weren't just
local darlings, selling out their last 16 games and running
attendance up to an unheard-of 18,000 a game, they were a national
phenomenon as well, with Miles' and Lamar Odom's jerseys ranking
among the NBA's top-10 sellers.</LD>
<LD>   Now Miles is a Cleveland Cavalier, having been traded for Andre
Miller, the Clippers' point guard of the future, or at least the next
two seasons. By then, Miller will have become eligible for free
agency ... as will Michael Olowokandi ... and Elton Brand ... and
Odom, Corey Maggette and Eric Piatkowski.</LD>
<TE>   Notice a trend?</TE>
<TE>   Last summer as the team began negotiations with Olowokandi and
Brand, the players waited for a sign that this was a new day in
Clipperdom</TE>
<TE>   None came. With no one to bid against, owner Donald T. Sterling
nevertheless overcame the temptation to re-sign any of them.</TE>
<TE>   Now the young players who put all those Clipper jokes behind them
and vowed to start a new tradition, wonder about their futures here
-- or, to be more accurate, are skeptical about having one -- which
isn't where you'd like their heads to be at the start of a season.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I heard," said Miles before the Cavaliers' 98-96 upset of
the Clippers on Wednesday night. "That's completely crazy. I don't
know what they're doing. That's their thing, though....</TE>
<TE>   "Elton Brand made the All-Star team last year and he didn't even
get a contract [extension]. He's the only big-name player in his
[draft] class that didn't get a contract. [Houston's] Steve Francis
got a contract, [New Orleans'] Baron Davis, [Phoenix's] Shawn Marion.
They're all in Elton's class, Andre's class. They only signed Mike
[Olowokandi] for one year....</TE>
<TE>   "I know they [Clipper players] have got to hold their tongue but I
can say something. I'm not on their team any more. I hope them boys
get some nice contracts. They deserve them. They're some good
players, they deserve everything they can get.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's a shame that you can get a good team, you get a team
that can be a contender and a team in the future that can be one of
the No. 1 teams in the world and you haven't signed anybody.
Everybody's on a rookie contract. You've got all the money, you just
don't want to give it up.</TE>
<TE>   "But you know, that's their thing. That's Elgin Baylor and Donald
Sterling."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, since large financial commitments are the sole province
of Sterling, it's not Baylor. Publicly, the organization expects big
things this season.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, the basketball operation is worried, to say the least.
Miles spent much of the day with his buddy, Quentin Richardson.
Before the game, he went down to the Clipper bench and offered Coach
Alvin Gentry his fist.</TE>
<TE>   It's different now. The Clippers were young and talented. The
Cavaliers are young and starting over, having just traded Miller,
who'd been their best player for three seasons, before they had to
sign him to a long-term deal. Tuesday night, they began the season in
Sacramento with a 27-point loss.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it [getting traded] didn't hurt at all because I know I'm in
the best situation," Miles said. "I get a lot of minutes, a lot of
shots. I get to show the world what I can really do, instead of
holding some of my game back.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good [Clipper] team. There were a lot of good players on
the team but I couldn't do what I can fully do on that team, and I
understand that. Either way, I was in a good position....</TE>
<TE>   "They're really cool. You know, we were young, cool, so everything
was right."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the trade may be what Miles needed. He's still an
incredible athlete and a terror in the open court but they don't play
fastbreak basketball in the NBA any more, so he's going to have to
learn to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did his former teammates look good. Despite a significant
superiority in talent and size, the Clippers were fighting for their
lives all night, until Zydrunas Ilgauskas' shot with 2.8 seconds left
iced them for good.</TE>
<TE>   After a summer of futile negotiations followed by a training camp
full of injuries, the Clippers open the season and go splat. Not
quite what they'd like to have seen in the way of omens.</TE>
<TE>   The darlings of Clipperdom are still young but they aren't as cool
as they used to be. Nor is everything right any more.</TE>

<HD>Williams Is Sued in Driver's Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of a limousine driver shot to death inside Jayson
Williams' mansion in New Jersey on Wednesday filed a wrongful death
lawsuit against the former NBA player.</LD>
<LD>   Costas "Gus" Christofi's family demanded in a lawsuit filed in
state Superior Court in Bergen County that Williams pay damages for
causing the driver's death and covering it up, according to a
statement released by the family's attorney.</LD>
<LD>   During a night of heavy drinking, Williams humiliated and cursed
Christofi before showing off with a shotgun and fatally shooting him,
prosecutors contend in court documents filed Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The details of the Feb. 14 shooting came in prosecutors' response
to a defense motion seeking to dismiss charges against Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 34, is accused of recklessly handling the gun that
killed Christofi and then trying to make the shooting look
self-inflicted. He could face nearly 45 years in prison if convicted
on all charges, including first-degree manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   In their filing, prosecutors allege, among other things, that
Williams had a probable blood-alcohol concentration of between 0.18%
and 0.22% at the time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege Williams asked guests to lie to investigators.
Two guests, Kent Culuko and John Gordnick, have pleaded guilty to
tampering charges and agreed to testify against Williams.</TE>

<TE>   A federal appeals court ordered a judge to resentence former
boxing heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe to at least 18 months in
prison for abducting his wife and their five children from their home
in Charlotte, N.C., in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The three judges on the appeals court ruled that the judge erred
in giving Bowe credit for time spent on probation, which allowed Bowe
to avoid prison time.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Marat Safin of Russia reached the third round of the Paris
Masters, beating David Nalbandian of Argentina, 6-3, 6-2, and earning
a spot in the season-ending Masters Cup next month at Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Roddick, seeded 11th, defeated Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia, 7-6
(4), 7-6 (3), and James Blake lost to 10th-seeded Carlos Moya of
Spain, 6-3, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Conchita Martinez and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario won singles matches,
giving Spain a 2-0 lead over Austria in their Fed Cup semifinal at
Maspalomas, Canary Islands. Italy and Slovakia were tied, 1-1, in the
other best-of-five semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan exercised his right to demand a
trade, when his agent filed the required paperwork with the Major
League Baseball Players Assn., but while the Dodgers will listen to
offers for Jordan, they aren't expected to seriously attempt to deal
him.</TE>
<TE>   If no deal is reached by March 15 and Jordan does not rescind his
request, he would become a free agent. But in so doing, Jordan would
lose free-agency rights for three years and forfeit $11.5 million on
his current contract, which includes a guaranteed $9 million in 2003
and a $10.5-million option for 2004 that can be bought out for $2.5
million.</TE>
<TE>   Angel reserve outfielder Orlando Palmeiro, 32, filed for free
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro had a pinch double and scored a run in four World Series
at-bats. He was hitless in his other two postseason at-bats. Palmeiro
batted .300 in 263 at-bats during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Roger Clemens declined to exercise a $10.3-million player
option for 2003, the New York Yankees said. But the option was really
an illusion designed to lower the Yankees' payroll figure during the
last two seasons because the five-time Cy Young Award winner gets a
$10.3-million buyout.</TE>
<TE>   The Yomiuri Giants beat the Seibu Lions, 6-2, at Tokorozawa to
complete a four-game sweep in the Japan Series. It was the Giants'
20th title, the most in Japan, and their first since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   USC senior center Kostas Charissis, who sat out the Trojans' final
eight men's basketball games last season because of a stress fracture
in his left ankle, has re-aggravated the injury in practice and is
out for an undetermined length of time.</TE>
<TE>   Tomas Kapusta's first goal of the year at 16:33 of the third
period turned out to be the game-winner in the Ice Dogs' 4-3 victory
over Anchorage at Long Beach Arena.</TE>
<TE>   The Ice Dogs moved to 2-2-0. Anchorage fell to 1-7-0.</TE>

<HD>Dallas' Woodson Is Fined $75,000</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dallas Cowboy safety Darren Woodson was fined $75,000 by the NFL on
Wednesday for a fourth-quarter hit on Seattle's Darrell Jackson, who
had a seizure after the game and spent a night in a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Woodson did not comment on the fine, but said, "I can't change the
way I was taught how to play."</LD>
<LD>   He was fined $7,500 twice before this year for hits, one on
Houston tight end Billy Miller and the other on Arizona quarterback
Jake Plummer.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson, who has heard in recent days from Woodson, is undergoing
more medical tests. He won't play against Washington on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren indicated that the seizure Jackson had
was more serious than initially believed.</TE>
<TE>   "The simple thing of the matter is Darrell almost died," Holmgren
said. "That's the deal. Is anything worth that?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis running back Edgerrin James might sit out Sunday's
game against Tennessee because of a partially torn right hamstring.
The Colts listed James as doubtful.</TE>

<TE>   Arizona receiver Bryan Gilmore was put on the injured list after
breaking his left leg against San Francisco on Sunday when he crashed
into a photographer's camera.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Super Bowl most valuable player Larry Brown, 32, was
arrested and charged with writing bad checks at Las Vegas casinos.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a former cornerback for the Cowboys, was released from jail
Monday after agreeing to pay nearly $44,000. He was arrested Oct. 23.</TE>

<TE>   A skeleton found last month under a fence in rural Afton, Okla.,
was identified as the former wife of Hall of Famer Gene Upshaw, now
executive director of the NFL Players Assn.</TE>
<TE>   It does not appear that Jimmye Lee Hill-Upshaw, who was 59, was
the victim of foul play, investigators said.</TE>

<LD>SAN JOSE -- The NCAA women's basketball tournament ended nearly eight
months ago. But the Pacific 10 Conference is still feeling the sting
of having only two teams -- Stanford and Arizona State -- placed in
the field of 64.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a slap in the face," USC Coach Chris Gobrecht said during
Pac-10 media day on Wednesday. "We've been preaching that our
nonconference schedules should be together; nonetheless, they weren't
that bad last year. Even though we were a young conference I still
say what happened last year was wrong."</LD>
<LD>   Other coaches described the NCAA selection committee's snubs as a
wakeup call. And one of the responses was to schedule every women's
basketball team short of the Sparks.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the big-name opponents playing Pac-10 schools in the
2002-03 season include defending NCAA champion Connecticut; Final
Four representatives Tennessee and Oklahoma; and Kansas State, Boston
College, Notre Dame, Pepperdine, Georgia, Texas Tech, New Mexico and
Louisiana State.</TE>
<TE>   All of them expect to start the season in the top 25 or wind up
there eventually.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard all about the [lack of strong] scheduling and RPI stuff
last year," Oregon State Coach Judy Spoelstra said. "I don't know if
enough schools took heed....</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be 10 schools strong in this conference. We can't just
let one or two schools pull us up."</TE>
<TE>   Beefing up the nonconference schedule is only part of the
solution. The conference needs more victories -- quality or otherwise
-- before other regions begin to give it the kind of respect it feels
it deserves.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't talk about it; we have to act upon it on the court,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "You have to play the [good]
teams but you have to beat them."</TE>

<LD>Clipper fans showed a healthy skepticism Wednesday night. Some of
them stayed away from Staples Center altogether, the empty purple
seats evidence of discontent. They were right to be unhappy.</LD>
<LD>   With what, though?</LD>
<LD>   Certainly with the 98-96 loss to Cleveland, a team that's not very
good.</LD>
<TE>   But with what else?</TE>
<TE>   With owner Donald Sterling's unwillingness to commit to the
future, to the way Michael Olowokandi and Elton Brand are playing
more for big contracts with other teams?</TE>
<TE>   With the players and their high school enthusiasm but with their
high school reluctance to play hard defensively, to wander with some
aggressiveness but not so much purpose on offense and to zone out
when there's no chance to score?</TE>
<TE>   With the realization that the Clippers may not be any closer to
the NBA playoffs than they were a year ago or two or three?</TE>
<TE>   Is it hard to watch Olowokandi hustle for a while, to demand
rebounds even if he takes them from teammates, and not think that he
is auditioning for that $100 million contract for next year?</TE>
<TE>   Is it hard not to find the strange hands to head circle
celebration thing a bit awkward now when it is being practiced not
only by the young Clippers -- Quentin Richardson, Corey Maggette --
but by the young Cavalier, Darius Miles?</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't much noise, except for the fellow who yelled "Angels"
during the national anthem and there wasn't much enthusiasm by the
end for a team that seems flummoxed as to where it wants to go.</TE>
<TE>   And it is past time for the Clippers to know where they want to
go.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry was wise when he said the other day that he
admired the Angels and the way they understood the advantages of true
teamwork, of sometimes putting aside one's personal goals for
something grander.</TE>
<TE>   And Gentry was unhappy, despondent almost, at what he saw from his
team in its 98-96 loss to Cleveland, a team which had been blown out
by Sacramento one night earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry lamented a lack of hustle, a disinterest in playing
defense, a refusal to go hard after loose balls. "They won the battle
of the hustle plays," Gentry said. "That's my biggest disappointment.
Not that we lost. We didn't do a very good job in defending. Too many
times it was one pass and shoot. That's what bothered me."</TE>
<TE>   So is it hard to warm up to this unformed entity? When will Lamar
Odom be healthy; he's already wealthy but will he ever be wise? Will
he ever be reliable and eager to work as part of the group?</TE>
<TE>   Is it worth getting worked up in November for a team that might
disintegrate by January? There should be substantial doubt about the
mind set of the Clippers -- the ones who might be distracted by the
swirl of contract speculation and the others who watch and wonder
what will happen to them when the contract expires?</TE>
<TE>   Why be bothered about a team that, with less than four minutes
left, in a tie game, let Ricky Davis rebound his own, horrible
clanged shot, let Davis grab it without moving a step, let him get it
while five Clippers watched?</TE>
<TE>   "That signified the whole night," Gentry said. "Davis shot the
ball and he still wanted the ball back more than we did." Where's the
percentage in being emotionally involved in this?</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand wasn't on the floor at the end, when the Clippers were
letting rebounds dribble off their fingers, letting passes trickle
out of bounds. Brand is clearly not in playing shape after knee
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   But this is a team without much margin for error. They are
supposed to improve. They are supposed to make the playoffs. It won't
be enough this year to dawdle, assume their natural talents will take
them into the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   The way this game disappeared in the fourth quarter, the way
Olowokandi took a shot outside his comfort range at the end when
Cleveland center Zydrunas Ilgauskas found just his spot, nine feet
from the basket, where he calmly shot over Olowokandi with 2.8
seconds left and made the game winner, may be haunting in March and
April when, if they're lucky, the Clippers will be scrapping for
playoff spot No. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, as Gentry said, wasn't quite ready to play. And he is the
best Clipper, the most reliable, the steadiest and hardest worker.
But it was discouraging to Gentry to see so many others on the floor
who didn't, wouldn't, couldn't pick up for Brand.</TE>
<TE>   "I have got to decide who I'm going to go with, who's going to
play," Gentry said. "I'm not gonna play 10 guys."</TE>
<TE>   That sounds like a threat and it should. The Clippers should be
better than what they offered Wednesday. And if a team can't be
excited on opening night, February could be grim.</TE>

<HD>Instead of a Hug, Sterling Really Needs Angel Magic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So I see Mickey Mouse in the car leading the Angels' victory parade
Tuesday, and right away I'm feeling better about Donald and the
Clippers' chances for success this season.</LD>
<LD>   But then I went to the team's first game Wednesday night and ran
into Sterling, who immediately made like Angels' broadcaster Rex
Hudler, and tried to hug me.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, I just stood there with my arms nailed to my sides,
displaying no emotion whatsoever -- thankful now that so many girls
had done the same to me early in life preparing me to handle this
moment.</LD>
<TE>   "Hug me, come on, hug me, put your arms around me," Sterling said,
and I remember begging like that, too, and getting nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW FOR hugging's sake, I hope someone treats Hudler to a Clipper
game this season and introduces him to Sterling because there's one
clinch for the record books. I'm sorry if I hurt Sterling's feelings
when I kept yelling into his ear, "Leave me alone," in the same tone
of voice I remember hearing from so many girls years ago. But at
least I didn't call him "a loser."</TE>
<TE>   Sterling finally got the hint, introduced me to his wife, and I
noted she put her hand out to shake mine because she's obviously all
hugged out living with this guy.</TE>
<TE>   "So what's your prediction this year?" I asked Sterling, and he
said, "Just hopeful." I didn't think it was that tough of a question,
so I tried again. "Do you think the team has a chance of making the
playoffs?" and he blew me a kiss.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I was having as a good a week with the wife as I've been
having with Hudler and Sterling, but then Hudler and Sterling have
reasons to be excited. The Angels have just completed the impossible
dream, and now it's the Clippers, who have been just as enjoyable to
watch the last two years as the Angels have been the last two months,
trying to stretch everyone's imagination.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, New Jersey proved it last year going from 26 wins a year
earlier to 52 and making the NBA Finals," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry
said. "It's very similar to what the Angels did, only the Nets ran
into Shaq and they couldn't very well intentionally walk him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CLIPPERS' motto this year is "Pure Basketball," which is
discouraging because NBA basketball these days isn't very
scintillating, and downright boring if you caught the Lakers' opener
against the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago the Clippers put on the best show in town, and while
they didn't always win, no one seemed to mind -- selling out the last
16 games.</TE>
<TE>   But that's how far the Clippers think they have come, playing the
kind of basketball one team official described as a "hard-working, no
pretense, unselfish style of play," designed to take the team to the
next level -- the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're healthy and play to our potential, we're a playoff
team," Gentry said, and with the Lakers standing 0-2 I guess it would
be nice to have one team in town displaying postseason potential.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is the Clippers are still owned by Donald, which until
recently seemed like a Magic Mountain too high to climb. But the cast
members who worked in Angel red for Michael Eisner this season proved
anything is possible no matter how Goofy the guy in control seems
most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were 6-14 to start, so following the leader, of course,
the Clippers are 0-1 to start. Nothing to worry about.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHINESE ROOKIE Yao Ming, who is 7 feet 5, made his debut for
Houston and scored no points in 13 minutes of play. Yao-wza. How do
you like his chances against Shaq?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE FALL issue of LA Youth is out -- a special issue on sports,
and begins with a wonderful story by Sharine Xuan from South Pasadena
High on Nastja Rebrin, a 16-year-old athlete with one arm. Xuan
obviously has the talent to replace sports columnist Bill Plaschke
down the road. Writers Gary Gray (Sunland Christian Academy) and Joo
Yoon (Troy High) already appear ready to take over Page 2 duties, and
I intend to advise school officials they have two troublemakers on
their hands. Anyone interested in obtaining a copy of LA Youth can
e-mail editor@layouth.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WONDER if Martha Burk knows what she's doing. So far all she has
accomplished is making the Masters the only commercial-free broadcast
of a sporting event on network TV. I have no idea now when I'm going
to be able to talk to the wife.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT'S JUST speculation on my part right now. But now that
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue is one of 74 names under consideration
for the Hall of Fame, I wonder if he makes it in January, and then
convinces NFL owners in March to place a Super Bowl in New York to
honor those killed on Sept. 11, if he'll follow Pete Rozelle's lead,
surprise everyone and announce his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOUSTON IS a three-point pick to defeat Cincinnati on Sunday,
although it's an expansion franchise and Bengal Coach Dick LeBeau has
predicted a victory.</TE>
<TE>   I agree with LeBeau, however, and make the Bengals the lock of the
year to defeat the Texans straight-up, and knowing sports editor Bill
Dwyre is going to be in Las Vegas over the weekend with company money
in his pocket, I have no doubt the Tribune Co. is going to appreciate
such expertise and the chance to make extra money when Dwyre returns
with the company's winnings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Len Gilman:</TE>
<TE>   "If your story today about Phil Jackson was tongue in cheek then
it just wasn't funny. If it was serious then you're a MORON. Have a
nice day. No offense intended."</TE>
<TE>   If your final comments were meant to be tongue in cheek, they
weren't funny. If you're being serious, well ...</TE>

<LD>Preparations for the men's and women's soccer tournaments at the
Athens 2004 Olympic Games are behind schedule, FIFA said Wednesday,
and world soccer's governing body added that the proposed match
schedule also needs refining.</LD>
<LD>   The FIFA Organizing Committee for the Olympic Football Tournament
met Tuesday in Zurich, Switzerland, under the chairmanship of African
Football Confederation President Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and
received what it called "a comprehensive report" on the status of
preparations from ATHOC, the Athens Olympic Organizing Committee.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement released on its Web site Wednesday, FIFA "expressed
concern in this regard, particularly regarding delays in the
construction of stadiums and other facilities," and set up a
subcommittee to monitor future progress.</LD>
<TE>   It also said that match schedules "would have to be reviewed for a
number of reasons, including the timing of the women's final." It did
not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The 2004 Olympic Games will take place Aug. 11-28, with the soccer
tournaments scheduled to be played in Athens, Patras, Volos,
Thessaloniki and Heraclio on the island of Crete.</TE>
<TE>   Champions League</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Real Madrid and the champions of England,
Germany and Spain advanced to the final 16 of the European Champions
League, bringing the number of teams that have secured a place to
nine.</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal slumped to its fourth loss in a row, 2-1, in front of
51,200 at Borussia Dortmund, but both teams went through to the next
round because Auxerre was beaten, 2-0, by PSV Eindhoven in the
Netherlands and cannot catch either team.</TE>
<TE>   French forward Thierry Henry gave Arsenal the early lead, but an
own goal by the Gunners' Brazilian defender Gilberto Silva tied the
score. Tomas Rosicky won it for Borussia with a second-half penalty
kick.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish champion Valencia earned a 1-0 victory at Liverpool on a
goal by Francisco Rufete to clinch its place.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, out-of-form European champion Real Madrid crashed to a
1-0 loss to AS Roma in front of 70,000 in Madrid, where Francesco
Totti scored the decisive goal in the 27th minute. AEK Athens' 1-1
tie at home with Genk of Belgium assured Real Madrid of advancing,
however.</TE>
<TE>   In other Champions League games, Inter Milan thumped Rosenberg
Trondheim, 3-0, and Ajax Amsterdam shut out Olimpique Lyon, 2-0, in
France.</TE>
<TE>   MLS Draft Set</TE>
<TE>   Major League Soccer will hold its 2003 player draft on Jan. 17 in
Kansas City in conjunction with the 56th annual convention of the
National Soccer Coaches Assn. of America, the league announced.</TE>
<TE>   Washington D.C. United will have the first selection overall.</TE>
<TE>   The league champion Galaxy will pick 10th in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Pope Has Surgery</TE>
<TE>   D.C. United and U.S. national team defender Eddie Pope will be
sidelined for six weeks after having surgery to remove scar tissue
from his knee, the MLS club said.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup 2006</TE>
<TE>   Franz Beckenbauer, a two-time World Cup winner for Germany and now
chairman of the organizing committee for the 2006 World Cup, said he
favors seeing five Asian countries take part in the event rather than
four as in Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   "Asian teams have improved significantly," Beckenbauer said while
on a visit to Qatar.</TE>
<TE>   The comment puts Beckenbauer at odds with FIFA President Joseph
"Sepp" Blatter, who wants an Oceania team to be given the place left
open in the 32-nation event now that the defending champion has to
qualify rather than gain automatic entry.</TE>

<HD>NFL Has Super Interest in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Tagliabue says a Super Bowl, likely in 2007 or 2008, could
be awarded to a significantly renovated Rose Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the seven years Los Angeles has been without an NFL team, the
league has entertained all sorts of stadium possibilities -- from
Carson to a rebuilt Coliseum, from Dodger Stadium to South Park.</LD>
<LD>   Now the spotlight is on the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Wednesday the league will
consider awarding a Super Bowl to a renovated Rose Bowl, and the most
likely candidates are the 2007 or 2008 games.</LD>
<TE>   "The [Super Bowl] committee consensus is that priority should be
given to playing a Super Bowl in the Los Angeles area if there were a
significant renovation of the Rose Bowl, which is under discussion,"
said Tagliabue, overseeing the league meetings in New York. "And that
membership should be prepared to give very serious consideration to a
Super Bowl in the Rose Bowl, whether or not there is an NFL team in
Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The league has never awarded a Super Bowl to a city -- or, in the
case of L.A., a region -- that does not have an NFL team. This
unprecedented move suggests the league already might have a team in
mind to move to L.A. and wants to grease the skids for a new or
refurbished stadium with its crown-jewel incentive. The San Diego
Chargers and Indianapolis Colts are among the teams that quietly have
investigated moving to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Tagliabue's comments might send Pasadena hearts aflutter, but
there is no rock-solid guarantee the Rose Bowl will land its sixth
Super Bowl. It's unlikely a vote would be taken on the matter within
the next year, and there is a weighty caveat: The stadium must
undergo a "significant renovation."</TE>
<TE>   Just as the NFL giveth, the NFL taketh away. Consider the case of
San Francisco, which was awarded the 1999 Super Bowl to be played in
a totally reconstructed Candlestick Park. But when then-49er owner
Eddie DeBartolo Jr. got into legal trouble over a riverboat-gaming
license and his grandiose plans for a stadium/shopping mall fell to
pieces, the league moved that Super Bowl to Miami and gave the Bay
Area a rain check.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, there is no San Francisco Super Bowl on the horizon.
The 2003 game will be played in San Diego, and the three after that
are scheduled to be played in Houston, Jacksonville and Detroit. A
warm-weather city is a likely candidate for the 2007 game, with New
York a top candidate for 2008.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to L.A., it's clear the NFL has turned its attention
to the Rose Bowl, considered by many people to be the next-best
option after a coalition of L.A. businessmen dropped their plans to
build a downtown football stadium adjacent to Staples Center. The
group cited political infighting and stepped-up competition from the
Coliseum as the main reasons for pulling out.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl ascended from an afterthought to a legitimate player
in August when John Moag was retained to help lure an NFL team. Moag,
chairman of a Maryland sports investment-banking firm, cleared the
way for the Cleveland Browns to move to Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "The commissioner's statement is highly significant," Moag said.
"It's an affirmation of the partnership that's developed between us.
But the statement on its own means nothing, because the onus is still
on us to produce."</TE>
<TE>   Moag is in the process of assembling a team of architects and
financial specialists who can put together a plan for a new Rose
Bowl, one that would have luxury suites and roughly two-thirds its
current capacity of more than 90,000 spectators. Two of the
cornerstone financing tools would be the promise of multiple Super
Bowls and a $150-million loan from the league.</TE>
<TE>   Coliseum officials also are positioning their stadium as an NFL
solution. Pat Lynch, the stadium's general manager, said Wednesday he
is not discouraged by the league's apparent fascination with the
Pasadena alternative. He merely sees it as a move to still the pot in
a market that's forever fluid.</TE>
<TE>   "My bet is there's no action taken on this for quite some time,"
Lynch said. "It's a great effort to get the L.A. marketplace excited,
and John Moag can walk around like he's a hero because maybe he
stimulated something. But the reality is they're just doing this to
shake up the marketplace. And they're doing a good job of it."</TE>

<HD>Mathis May Not Stay to Watch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every time Tyler Ebell rushes for 100 yards, Wendell Mathis feels as
if he has taken another step backward.</LD>
<LD>   Like Ebell, Mathis is a highly recruited Bruin redshirt freshman
tailback.</LD>
<LD>   Like Ebell, Mathis waited behind veterans Akil Harris and Manuel
White early in the season.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike Ebell, who has averaged 146 yards the last four games,
Mathis has not played much.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt it's frustrating," he said. "The coaches always say that
when you get an opportunity, make the most of it. Tyler's done that.
I just haven't had my opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Mathis entered the season ahead of Ebell on the depth chart.
However, Ebell was impressive returning punts and got the call when
Harris was ineffective and White was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Now it appears the productive Ebell won't relinquish the job --
perhaps for four years.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis, a cousin of basketball assistant Gerald Madkins, is loyal
to UCLA, but he would consider transferring.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to talk to the coaches and ask where they see me
fitting in," he said. "I love it here, but I'm not going to sit
around and waste the talent God gave me."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Skipper, the Bruin offensive coordinator, said Mathis might
replace Ebell on occasion in short yardage situations.</TE>
<TE>   "Wendell is a strong back, a good back, and he'll get some
opportunities," Skipper said.</TE>

<TE>   When a defense plays as well as UCLA's has the last two years, the
man primarily responsible deserves credit. And in Phil Snow's case,
he could deserve a head coaching job.</TE>
<TE>   Snow, in his second season as defensive coordinator, readily
acknowledges that he wants to run his own program. Someday.</TE>
<TE>   "The right opportunity and situation needs to come along," he
said. "We've got four games, plus potentially a bowl game to go, so
I'm not even going to look at that right now."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA ranks first in the Pacific 10 Conference against the pass,
ninth against the run and is third in total defense.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nate Fikse was named Pacific 10 Conference special teams player of
the week after kicking five field goals against Stanford. They were
the first field goals of Fikse's four-year career.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he averaged 43.8 yards on four punts and had five of
eight kickoffs result in touchbacks.</TE>

Olson will start at quarterback until Saturday.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Campaign Begins for Palmer</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC will step up its Heisman Trophy campaign for quarterback Carson
Palmer this weekend when it mails and e-mails a color picture
postcard highlighting his achievements to national media outlets.</LD>
<LD>   The promo is a "V.I.P. Pass" to "The Carson Show," and features an
action photo of Palmer with statistical information on the back. USC
also is adding a special Palmer link to its Web site and, with the
Trojans in a bye week, Palmer is scheduled to appear on ESPN's "Game
Day" show on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer said Wednesday that he would not be distracted by the
Heisman buzz.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not worried or even thinking about it," he said. "I'm just
going to keep doing what I'm doing. It shouldn't affect me because
I'm not going to pay much attention to it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserves and players expected to redshirt will receive the bulk of
the playing time tonight when the Trojans scrimmage in what Coach
Pete Carroll calls a Halloween Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he is especially looking forward to evaluating such
players as redshirt linebackers Frostee Rucker and Lofa Tatupu and
freshmen linemen Kyle Williams, Chris Doyle and Kurt Katnik.</TE>
<TE>   Tatupu, the son of former USC fullback Mosi Tatupu, welcomes the
opportunity after transferring to USC from Maine.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming from Maine to a real football school has been great," he
said. "Back there, it's all hockey."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Doyal Butler, who backed up Omar Nazel against
Oregon and recorded a sack, said tonight's scrimmage is one more
chance to improve.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm nowhere near as good as I can be yet," said Butler, who
switched from tight end to defensive line at the end of training
camp. "I took a big step in the right direction last week and now I
have a week and a half to get ready to do something the next game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC assistants will spend much of today recruiting before
returning for practice. Carroll will be on the road recruiting on
Friday and Saturday.... Redshirt quarterback Brandon Hance, who is
recovering from shoulder surgery, will take snaps for the service
team next week, Carroll said. Hance is not expected to throw passes
until possibly the following week.... Offensive tackle Jacob Rogers
did not practice to rest his right knee.... Cornerback Justin Wyatt
did not practice because of a stomach virus.</TE>

<HD>Running on Empty</HD>
<DH>Many drivers have abandoned CART series, but Vasser says he
hasn't decided about next season</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Sunday's Toyota 500 at California Speedway, Jimmy Vasser may be
the only American left standing in Championship Auto Racing Teams. Or
maybe he'll be gone too.</LD>
<LD>   "I still want to work at saving CART, but things are very much up
in the air about next year," the 36-year-old former CART champion
said after arriving home from a harrowing trip to Australia last
week. "Nothing is 100% right now. I could be back in CART, I could be
in NASCAR driving in the Busch series, or I could even be in the
[Indy Racing League].</LD>
<LD>   "The only thing for sure is that I will be driving in the
Indianapolis 500 again for Bobby Rahal and Miller."</LD>
<TE>   Vasser, with Michael Andretti, one of only two American drivers in
Sunday's 500, will be driving Team Rahal's No. 8 Shell Ford Lola when
practice opens Friday on the two-mile oval in Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   Andretti already has announced that he will be in the IRL next
year with his own team, which includes Scotsman Dario Franchitti and
Brazilian Tony Kanaan from CART.</TE>
<TE>   "Only time will tell, but the way [President and Chief Executive
Chris] Pook is energizing CART, I think it has a chance," Vasser
said. "It's a good product, has good venues, a lot of good people and
if Pook can rebuild it in the next two years I think it has a good
future."</TE>
<TE>   Only four drivers who competed in the U.S. 500 in 1996, when CART
held a race opposite the IRL and the Indianapolis 500 on the same
day, are still in CART for Sunday's race. They are Vasser, who was
the U.S. 500 winner, Andretti, Christian Fittipaldi and Paul Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   One thing CART can't survive is many more debacles such as last
Sunday's rain-swamped "race" in Surfers Paradise, Australia, in which
Vasser was involved in a nine-car pileup on the first lap. The race
was started a second time and got even more bizarre as CART officials
changed the length of the race several times before stopping it on
Lap 41 of a scheduled 70 with Mexico's Mario Dominguez declared the
winner.</TE>
<TE>   "It was zero visibility," Vasser said. "I was coming down, trying
to maintain my pace to take the green flag when Adrian [Fernandez]
checked up and by the time I could see him it was too late. I was
only about four or five feet from him. It was too late."</TE>
<TE>   On the narrow Gold Coast street course, the two cars blocked the
road -- with several rows of cars coming at them and unable to see.</TE>
<TE>   "After I clipped Adrian and got sideways, someone hit me and the
next thing I knew I was upside down sliding down the street. I could
see Michael [Andretti's] car nose coming straight at me and I was
thinking, 'Don't hit the cockpit.'</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, he didn't, but there were cars flying everywhere. With
the mist in the air and the spray from the tires on the wet pavement
there was absolutely no way to see where you were going. It was a job
just to find the road."</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez and Tora Takagi were hospitalized, but both were
released in time to make the trip home. Fernandez, who suffered neck
injuries, will not drive Sunday, but Takagi is cleared to compete.
Fernandez, the team owner, chose Max Papis to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the wrong place at the wrong time," Fernandez said. "The
visibility was zero and I was hit from behind and then Tora's car
landed on top of my head. It could have killed me. It was just one of
those things."</TE>
<TE>   After more than an hour, the mess was cleared and the race
restarted with half the field, including Vasser, in backup cars. A
late pit stop, mandated by CART rules, dropped Vasser from third to
12th after 34 of the 40 laps were run under yellow caution flag
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst part was sitting an hour and a half behind the pace
car," said Vasser. "I was soaking wet, it was getting dark, real
dark, the wind went down and it was freezing. I felt like I had
frostbite."</TE>
<TE>   California Speedway, where Vasser has a win and three top-five
finishes in six starts, should be drier.</TE>
<TE>   His win in 1998 was one of the most memorable of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "That race was pretty wild since I was racing against Alex
[Zanardi, Vasser's teammate] and Greg [Moore, who was killed the next
year at Fontana]. We swapped the lead back and forth and I was able
to get by Greg at the checkered flag.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking back, that was a very special race. In the truck that
went around the track after the race, we had Alex, Greg, Chip
[Ganassi, Vasser's car owner], Bobby [Rahal, who drove in his final
race] and David Letterman [Rahal's partner]. Obviously, a lot of
things have happened since that victory lap and now I'm driving for
Bobby and David. I would like to give them a win at Fontana."</TE>
<TE>   In 17 races this year, Vasser's best finishes were second at Long
Beach and third at Miami, both street races.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we can salvage something from this season," Vasser said.
"Fontana is a horsepower track and we've been a little down on power,
especially top-end power, but maybe the Ford [engineers] can get us
some more horsepower this week. They've done a fantastic job with
their resources, but Honda and Toyota have put a lot more money into
their programs."</TE>
<TE>   The Ford Cosworth engine, used by Vasser and teammate Michel
Jourdain, Player's Forsythe teammates Patrick Carpentier and Alex
Tagliani and Australia winner Dominguez, is virtually the same one
that will be used by all CART competitors next year. The turbocharged
V-8 engines will be detuned around 100 horsepower in the interest of
durability and cost.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota, which like Honda is switching to the IRL next year,
clinched the CART manufacturers' championship last week when Kenny
Brack finished fourth at Surfers Paradise.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll look like a spec series next year, no doubt, with everyone
using the same engines and the same old chassis, but if that's what
is necessary to keep the costs down, we've got to do it," Vasser said
of CART's 2003 program.</TE>
<TE>   Vasser's future is in question, but he is far from through with
this year. After the season-ending CART race Nov. 17 in Mexico City,
he will drive a Class 1 buggy in the SCORE Baja 1000 the following
week. The race runs the length of Baja California, from Ensenada to
La Paz.</TE>
<TE>   "I did some pre-running down near Ensenada with Mike and Robbie
Groff and I can't wait to do the real thing," Vasser said. "I had
never done anything like that before and I was amazed at the
capabilities of the car. It was very impressive."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Is there really such a thing as a ghost ship? The Queen Mary in Long
Beach has long been a source for stories about ghost sightings and
eerie occurrences. People have often wondered if ghosts really exist
aboard the historic ship.</LD>
<LD>   The pool, which is no longer in use, has been a familiar
ghost-sighting area. Over the years, there have been stories of women
dressed in old-style bathing suits near the pool, the sound of water
splashing, children's laughter and wet footprints leading into the
changing room.</LD>
<LD>   In the first-class staterooms, there have been reports of running
water and lights turning on in the middle of the night. And some say
they have heard a baby's cry from a room that once was the site of
the third-class children's playroom.</LD>
<TE>   You can decide for yourself if the tales are fact or fiction at
the "Ghosts &amp; Legends of the Queen Mary" show. This special-effects,
walk-through tour dramatizes historic and supernatural events that
have been reported on the ship during the past 66 years.</TE>
<TE>   The show takes guests through locations known for "ghostly"
activity including eerie lower decks, the original swimming pool and
alleyways and boiler rooms.</TE>
<TE>   This spooky show is open daily. Tours leave hourly.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, please call (562) 435-3511 or visit

<HD>'The Year There Was No Halloween'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: There's no pumpkin patch and nobody's
ever heard of trick-or-treating or Halloween either!</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bobette Newcomer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody at school mentioned Halloween, and I didn't either. Enough
people already thought I was crazy. In spite of everything, I was
still sure that I was right!</LD>
<LD>   I waited until it was dark outside. Then, I put on my long black
cape, messed up my hair, smeared some of my mom's red lipstick on my
face and called Casey so I could put on her leash.</LD>
<LD>   The first house I went to was right next door. They had not put up
any Halloween decorations that I could see -- how boring! When I rang
the doorbell, Mrs. Larson came to the door.</LD>
<TE>   "Well, hello Jake," she said, looking surprised to see me standing
on her porch after dark with my dog, a brown paper bag, and makeup on
my face.</TE>
<TE>   "What can I do for you?"</TE>
<TE>   "Trick or treat!" I shouted.</TE>
<TE>   "Trick or treat? What's that?" she asked, acting puzzled. "Jake,
are you OK? You look like you are bleeding!"</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Larson," I said quickly, "it's Halloween, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   She just shook her head. "No," she said, "it's not ... uh -- I'm
sorry, what was that thing you just asked me about, Jake?"</TE>
<TE>   "Halloween," I answered. "Isn't there a fun holiday every Oct. 31
called Halloween?"</TE>
<TE>   "Jake," Mrs. Larson said, "you are scaring me! Why are you wearing
a black cape and bleeding at the mouth? I'm calling your mother right
now!"</TE>
<TE>   Now I was embarrassed. All I could think of to say was "Thank you
anyway, Mrs. Larson."</TE>
<TE>   I ran down the sidewalk and went to another house that was farther
down the street -- the house I liked to go every Halloween because
they always gave out big candy bars.</TE>
<TE>   I knocked on the door. There was only a porch light and one dim
light on inside -- just to make it more spooky, I thought to myself.
I waited, wondering why they were taking so long to open the door. I
finally realized they were not going to come to the door at all
because nobody was home.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: What has happened to Jake's favorite holiday?</TE>
