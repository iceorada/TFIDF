<HD>'Brown Sugar': The Hip-Hop of Romance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Famuyiwa's "Brown Sugar" is a sly and sophisticated romantic
comedy with a depth of characterization matched by its appreciation
of the world of hip-hop. It's a mainstream movie in the best sense:
an all-too-infrequent big-screen depiction of successful, affluent
African Americans facing complex personal and professional choices.
Pictures like "Barbershop" and "Brown Sugar" provide crucial balance
to urban action dramas. Significantly, "Brown Sugar" marks an
executive producer debut for Magic Johnson, a pioneer in bringing
new, first-class movie theaters to African American communities.</LD>
<LD>   Sanaa Lathan stars as Sidney, a talented pop music writer
departing the Los Angeles Times to return to her native New York to
become editor of a hip-hop magazine. Hip-hop has been the center of
Sidney's life since as a little girl she came upon a bunch of guys
performing in a park on a July day in 1984. It is of equal
significance that on that day she met a little boy, Dre, who was
equally enthralled by this new music, and their shared passion would
make them best friends.</LD>
<LD>   Back in New York, Sidney and Dre (Taye Diggs) are glad to see one
another again but are feeling awkward, although they long ago decided
against taking their friendship to a different level.</LD>
<TE>   Yet Sidney is overcome with an emotional rush (which she instantly
denies), since Dre is about to march up the aisle with one of the
glamour girls who ordinarily last about a month in his life.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the two cannot resist seeking one another's support,
especially since Dre is becoming increasingly unhappy with his
high-paying job at a record company--his boss is intent on trying to
mainstream hip-hop. Not only does hip-hop provide a vibrant
soundtrack for the film but also a serious subtext. Hip-hop is sacred
to Sidney and Dre as an expression of young black experience and
aspirations in which they recognize themselves. Traditionally, the
mainstream has come to hip-hop and not the other way around, and this
is an important moral distinction to Sidney and Dre.</TE>
<TE>   When Dre goes ahead and marries the spectacular-looking Reese
(Nicole Ari Parker), Sidney is ripe for the attentions of the
similarly striking Kelby (Boris Kodjoe), a basketball star looking to
break through as a hip-hop artist. But as Sidney's pal Francine
(Queen Latifah), a truth-teller from the get-go, says to Sidney, who
is she kidding?</TE>
<TE>   Famuyiwa and co-writer Michael Elliott show persuasively that the
bond between Sidney and Dre is so strong and of such duration that
they are just plain scared of endangering it. In short, they are
overwhelmed by their familiarity with one another as friends and
terrified of the unknown territory they would be traversing as
lovers. Since they're adults, it's easy to identify with Francine's
exasperation over their mutual reticence, but the filmmakers deflect
this by wisely presenting Reese and Kelby in the round. Reese is a
forthright, successful attorney eager to make work a marriage she
rightly feels is becoming overshadowed by her husband's special
friendship. Kelby is an intelligent and witty man who loves Sidney
and is unafraid of expressing his devotion to her.</TE>
<TE>   "Brown Sugar" is as satisfying as it is sleek, and Famuyiwa
inspires carefully nuanced portrayals from his cast, which includes
Mos Def as a humorous hip-hop artist who would rather drive a cab
than sell out. Indeed, "Brown Sugar" proves as appealing as its
title.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG 13, for sexual content and language. Times
guidelines: The sexual overtones are discreet; the language is blunt
but realistic.</TE>

<HD>Children's Museum Deferring Downtown Art Park for Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Children's Museum of Los Angeles has put on hold plans to build
its $60-million museum in Little Tokyo, one of two new proposed
branches, because of the weak economy, the president of the museum's
board of trustees said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "There are no immediate plans to build downtown," said President
Ronald Gastelum, who also serves on the board of governors. The
museum will go forward on a new, $40-million facility in Hansen Dam
Recreation Area in the northeast San Fernando Valley, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to defer Art Park and focus the museum's resources on
Hansen Dam was made last week after months of debate by the museum's
board of governors.</LD>
<TE>   "The business reality began to creep in that we had to take stock
of whether we could raise the $112 million [needed for both projects]
in the time frame we had set," said Gastelum, who is also chief
executive officer of the Metropolitan Water District.</TE>
<TE>   "After much debate, both boards are of a single mind that the best
business course of action would be to focus on one campus at this
time," he said. "The logical choice is the less expensive Hansen Dam
campus--plus, we are further along in our engineering and
architectural work on Hansen Dam."</TE>
<TE>   Although the museum has no plans to go forward with the downtown
project at this time, he said, "that doesn't mean it's not going to
be reexamined on a regular basis."</TE>
<TE>   Formerly housed near the proposed Little Tokyo site, the
Children's Museum closed in 2000. Architect Thom Mayne of the Santa
Monica firm Morphosis completed conceptual drawings for a downtown
museum, whose angled walls suggest the Japanese art of origami, or
folded paper.</TE>
<TE>   The museum was to stand at the corner of Temple and Judge John
Aiso streets, near the Japanese American Cultural Center and the
Geffen Contemporary art museum. Supporters hoped it would add
critical mass to an increasingly lively downtown arts scene.</TE>
<TE>   The museum has a long-term lease from the city on the property.
Gastelum said the city's willingness to hold the property for Art
Park would also be a factor in the ultimate fate of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Both projects have their champions on the boards, he said. But in
the end, there was unanimity that the museum should concentrate on
Hansen Dam. "Economic conditions are really driving this for us," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The nature-oriented, environmentally friendly facility in Lake
View Terrace will be the first major museum to be built in the San
Fernando Valley. Gastelum said the current lack of a major cultural
center made the Valley project appear to be "a more urgent need."</TE>
<TE>   Since Hansen Dam was originally conceived as a satellite, the
design may have to be modified to accommodate administrative offices,
Gastelum said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hansen Dam museum was designed by Sarah Graham of the Los
Angeles architectural firm Angelil/Graham/Pfenninger/Scholl. Edwin
Schlossberg's New York firm has completed plans for the exhibits at
Hansen Dam, which will focus on the natural elements of earth, air,
fire and water.</TE>
<TE>   Schlossberg, whose work includes exhibits at New York's Ellis
Island, was also retained to design the exhibits for Art Park, which
was to focus on the urban environment and the performing and visual
arts.</TE>
<TE>   The target date for groundbreaking at Hansen Dam is June 2003 with
completion in 2004 or 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is committed to a first-rate children's museum for our
community," Gastelum said. "Our vision for two campuses can't be
realized today. But I think our boards are very pleased we still have
a good opportunity to build one campus today that will serve the
entire community."</TE>

<HD>The Modern World Prays for Answers</HD>
<DH>'On earth as it is in heaven,' a haunting work by About
Productions, examines four individuals who are searching for meaning
in their lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One unavoidable consequence of living in an era of cultural
relativism and information overload is the loss of ready-made answers
to spiritual questions. Another is a profound sense of isolation from
one another, heightened by the absence of a shared value system.</LD>
<LD>   Both of these modern maladies of the psyche figure prominently in
the latest interdisciplinary creation from About Productions: "On
earth as it is in heaven" at the 24th Street Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Combining words, movement, music, abstract sculpture and light to
explore the mystery of prayer in our secular age, this haunting work
illuminates the thorny relationship between spiritual uncertainty and
alienation. Not only are the problems connected, the piece suggests,
but also in our grappling with the former lies at least a glimmer of
a solution to the latter.</LD>
<TE>   Employing the prism-like narrative equivalent of a Cubist
painting, co-writers Theresa Chavez (who also directs), Laurel
Ollstein and Rose Portillo tackle these issues from the fragmented
perspectives of four characters from diverse walks of life. Their
isolation is established in opening choreography that has them
darting restlessly around the stage, never acknowledging one another,
before launching into their individual histories. Each examines from
a different angle the role of prayer and its potential to fill the
holes in his or her life.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting her family reservation, a thoroughly "assimilated"
American Indian (Portillo) finds herself unexpectedly reconnected to
her long-forsaken cultural roots through the mystical insights of her
dying aunt. A coolly rational neurologist (Alberto Antonio Araiza),
hiding from his inability to deal with clinical death, buries himself
in empirical research into strange brain activity during prayer. A
former dancer (Ollstein), facing a deteriorating body that modern
medicine is powerless to remedy, attempts to reconcile the spiritual
and physical dimensions of her being. An angry teenage prostitute
(Jesse Ramirez) embraces self-destructive behavior to exact revenge
on his deeply religious mother.</TE>
<TE>   Telling these stories through interlocking monologues is a risky
structural device that serves in far too many modern plays as a
Band-Aid for inability to craft dialogue. Here, however, the form is
essential to the theme of alienation, not only in emphasizing the
vast distances between the characters but also in moving toward an
underlying commonality of human experience through parallel themes
and images that emerge in the respective soliloquies. These people
never meet for coffee at Starbucks, but their fragmented identities
commingle and increasingly reinforce one another.</TE>
<TE>   The play's challenging, densely packed visual, verbal and aural
associations repay careful attention but leave little opportunity for
viewers to coast on theatrical cliches and expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Balancing the heady thematic content are the rich emotional
textures in Anne LeBaron's evocative original score. Recorded string
quartet, harp and wind instruments are accompanied by a live
percussionist (Joshua Jade or Zack Behrens), in angular, rapidly
shifting moods suited to the characters.</TE>
<TE>   The equally inventive visual components include Noah Riskin's
hand-held lights and an abstract set design of suspended rectangular
plexiglass panels designed by architect Gustavo Rincon and Plasis
Design. In combination, the images thrown by body-mounted lights on
the semi-opaque panels transform the actors into eerie figures
reminiscent of a Francis Bacon painting.</TE>
<TE>   All four actors display solid control of their characters,
although Portillo and Araiza turn in the more layered performances.
Araiza's wistful ruminations on the limitations of intellect are
starkly complemented by Portillo's intense descent into ritual.</TE>
<TE>   The play's tough-minded vision permits no easy assurances; simply
"finding religion" is not an option here. But what is possible (and
ultimately essential) for these characters is groping through their
individual pain toward a terrifyingly partial, unromanticized access
to faith in the modern world.</TE>

<HD>'Transporter' Breaks His Own Rule, All Heck Breaks Loose</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis; Kevin Thomas; Gene Seymour; John Anderson;</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This month's Luc Besson movie plays a lot like last month's--only
better. As with "Wasabi" and a few other action titles marshaled by
the prolific French producer, "The Transporter" centers on a smooth
professional whose routine is interrupted by a hailstorm of bullets
and a beautiful woman. The professional here is Frank Martin (Jason
Statham), a former British military agent who lives on the Cote
d'Azur, where he earns his keep delivering packages to whoever will
pay his exorbitant fee. A man of few scruples and three exacting
rules--including the dictum that he never opens the package--Martin
inaugurates his potential demise when he peeks inside a squirming
duffel bag. Inside the package is a ravishing hostage (Taiwanese
actress Shu Qi); outside, of course, a world of trouble.</LD>
<TE>   With his bullet head and cut-glass profile, Martin doesn't
initially come across as an especially appealing addition to the
ranks of action heroes. Dressed in a black suit and white shirt while
seated behind the wheel of his BMW, he looks a lot like a
moonlighting bouncer, one of those guys who takes his shaved head and
muscles a little too seriously. Until he shifts into drive, that is,
and starts looking more like Clive Owens in one of those nifty
Internet shorts produced by the German car company and directed by
the likes of the late John Frankenheimer. Martin doesn't just zip
through the perilously winding French streets, he flies--launching
the character and this enjoyable trifle on an action high it mostly
sustains for the next hour.</TE>
<TE>   As with many movies of this type, the plot doesn't rate as high as
the quality of the bodies in fast, furious motion. What counts in
"The Transporter" isn't the wafer-thin story about smugglers, the
kind that television dramas burn through each week; it's the way
Martin kicks open a door, fends off a couple of axes and uses a
perfectly ordinary sport shirt as a weapon. The paucity of dialogue
makes it impossible to know if Statham could handle, say, Shakespeare
(he's done stints in the Jet Li vehicle "The One" and Guy Ritchie's
gangster features), but the actor certainly seems equipped to develop
into a mid-weight alternative to Vin Diesel. That's particularly true
if he keeps working with director Cory Yuen, a Hong Kong action
veteran whose talent for hand-to-hand mayhem is truly something to
see.</TE>

<TE>   Love and Redemption</TE>
<TE>   Cooked in Hell's Kitchen</TE>
<TE>   For his fifth feature, Edward Burns takes a refreshing departure
from romantic comedy to make one of his best, most mature films, "Ash
Wednesday," a taut, melancholy tale of brotherly love and redemption
set in the darkly atmospheric Irish American underworld of
Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen. "Ash Wednesday" has understandably been
compared to Martin Scorsese's "Mean Streets," but it's the fatalistic
aura of Eugene O'Neill that hangs over it most strongly.</TE>
<TE>   The film takes place between sunrise and sunset on Ash Wednesday
1983. Because its settings are exclusively old apartment buildings,
worn taverns with lots of dark wood and an immense Victorian-era
Catholic church, and because it concerns itself with the playing out
of an ancient vendetta, "Ash Wednesday" could easily be set a century
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Three years earlier to the day, young Sean Sullivan (Elijah Wood),
tending bar, overhears three thugs in the Moran gang plotting to
imminently rub out Sean's older brother Francis (Burns). Sean reaches
into a drawer, pulls out a gun and opens fire. Shortly thereafter,
only Sean's arm, identified by his wristwatch, turns up in the East
River. In an instant, Francis straightens out his life and looks
after Sean's widow (Rosario Dawson) and infant son.</TE>
<TE>   For all its brooding quality, "Ash Wednesday" is suspenseful and
ultimately unpredictable, with a sterling ensemble cast.</TE>
<TE>   David Shire's evocative score and Russell Fine's moody camerawork
blend seamlessly to create a drama that beautifully expresses Burns'
abiding concerns of brotherhood, Catholicism and morality that is as
embracing as it is seductively destructive.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Thomas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rated R for pervasive language and some violence. Exclusively at
the Fairfax Cinemas, Beverly Boulevard at Fairfax Avenue, L.A., (323)
655-4010. Running time: 1 hour, 38 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   In the Scary 'Below,'</TE>
<TE>   It's Enigmas Ahoy</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, director David Twohy's "Below" has the makings of
a B-movie horror classic. Somewhere in the Atlantic during the Second
World War, the crew of the U.S. ship Tiger Shark happens across three
survivors from a downed British ship. Among the rescued are two
sailors and an inquisitive female nurse (Olivia Williams) whose very
presence provokes consternation among the crew. The men think she
foretells bad luck, and so she does--with shivers and appreciable
intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Written by Darren Aronofsky ("Pi") and Lucas Sussman, along with
horror veteran Twohy, "Below" has a slamming first hour. As Ian
Wilson's camera darts over Charles Lee's spookily atmospheric sets,
enigmas sprout like mushrooms. A turntable spins uncontrollably
("Sing, Sing, Sing" it commands), and ghostly faces materialize with
the persistence of unwelcome guests. The captain (Bruce Greenwood)
twitches with the certainty of the condemned while everyone
else--Matt Davis, Holt McCallany, Scott Foley, Zach Galifianakis,
Dexter Fletcher, Jason Flemyng and Nick Chinlund--wanders about with
the haunted look of men who can't find a way out. Every bang makes
them jump (us too).</TE>
<TE>   If "Below" had been released in 1943--the year of its story--it
would have come in at an agile 70 minutes instead of a protracted
104. Twohy has said he studied the work of Jacques Tourneur, the
director of sleek 1940s thrillers such as "Cat People." You can see
Tourneur's imprint on "Below," which makes better use of shadow than
most neo-noirs, as well as that of his three-time producer Val
Lewton, whose 1943 "The Ghost Ship" may be another inspiration. A
legendary figure, Lewton had a genius for restraint--including brisk
running times. One look at "Below" and he would brought out the
scissors, knowing as he did that the key to great horror isn't how
much you explain but how little.</TE>

<TE>   Mob Rule Once Again</TE>
<TE>   in 'Knockaround Guys'</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Hopper and John Malkovich as Italian American Brooklyn
crime bosses? After three-plus seasons of "The Sopranos" and dozens
upon dozens of gangster epics, casting two of cinema's iconic weirdos
as mob royalty in "Knockaround Guys" seems ... what? ... too
reductive, too shallow, too ... exotic? Certainly, Malkovich's
portrayal of mob lieutenant Teddy Deserve (!) and his lacquered
swagger represent the only thing here that you haven't seen a hundred
times before.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Koppelman and David Levien, making their directorial debut
after writing the screenplay for 1998's cult-fave poker flick,
"Rounders," seemed to have started out with an unusual premise. Matty
Demaret (Barry Pepper), son of crime czar Benny Chains (Hopper), is
trying to get a job as a sports agent but is rebuffed because of his
family ties. With Matty's own real-world prospects narrowing, he asks
his dad and "Uncle Teddy" for a chance to prove himself by
supervising what seems a routine transfer of illicit cash. He gets
three buddies: faux swinger Chris (Andrew Davoli), muscleman Taylor
(Vin Diesel) and grubby gofer Johnny Marbles (Seth Green). While
flying the bag of swag from Spokane to New York, Johnny stops to
refuel in Montana, where the sight of a local lawman (Tom Noonan)
spooks him and the scheme goes awry. Everyone carries out assigned
roles with conviction, even Diesel and Green, who fit into the
confines of this genre better than one would expect.</TE>

<HD>These Hosts Have a Considerable Legacy to Uphold</HD>
<DH>The longest-running show on public radio, 'All Things
Considered' is getting two new anchors, one a loyal fan and the other
an NPR veteran.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like so many other fans of National Public Radio's afternoon
newsmagazine, Michele Norris has sat in her driveway, transfixed by a
story on "All Things Considered," unable to shut off the car until
the report is over.</LD>
<LD>   Come Dec. 9, she'll be the one on the other end of the radio.</LD>
<LD>   Norris was named co-host of "All Things Considered" this week,
joining NPR correspondent Melissa Block. Norris leaves ABC, where she
was a Washington-based correspondent for "World News Tonight,"
"20/20," "Nightline" and "Good Morning America," and joins NPR on
Monday. She'll go on the air Dec. 9, on the program heard locally on
KPCC-FM (89.3) weekdays from 3 to 6:30 p.m. and on KCRW-FM (89.9)
from 4 to 7 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   "It's one of the few places where you can discuss Los Alamos and
Los Lobos in the same broadcast," said Norris, who calls herself a
long and loyal listener of the show. "The opportunity to help shape
and guide a broadcast of substance and depth, it's the highlight of
my career."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, NPR announced that its national security
reporter, Steve Inskeep, will become host of "Weekend All Things
Considered," which airs on KPCC and KCRW from 5 to 6 p.m. Saturdays
and Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   "Finding hosts for our shows is not always an easy task," said
Bruce Drake, NPR's vice president for news and information. "The 'All
Things Considered' jobs are demanding jobs, and there's not a lot of
people who could do these."</TE>
<TE>   But not a lot of people needed to because of the show's stability.
Robert Siegel, Noah Adams and Linda Wertheimer had co-hosted the
weekday program for 13 years, until the network reassigned Wertheimer
as a roving correspondent in January. Then in March, Adams went on
sabbatical to write a book about the Wright brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, NPR officials announced that Block, their New York
correspondent, would join Siegel in February to fill one of the
vacancies, and now Norris completes the trio on "All Things
Considered."</TE>
<TE>   The program, which started in 1970 and is the longest-running show
in public radio history, reaches about 12 million listeners per week.</TE>
<TE>   "The show is incredibly elastic, which is part of its success,"
said Norris, 41. "They cover the news and then go beyond that, to
bring a bit of whimsy into our lives. They bring all of these
interesting people in my life and place them in the passenger seat
next to me on the way home."</TE>
<TE>   Before joining ABC in 1989, Norris worked at the Los Angeles
Times, the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Post, where she won a
Livingston Award and several other honors for a series on a
6-year-old living in a crack house. When she gets to NPR, Norris
said, she wants to continue her interest in covering education and
social issues, and said she has a "strange fascination with suburban
life" and the suburbs' new immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Drake said it was the breadth of Norris' experience and body of
work that made her stand out from the dozens of others considered.</TE>
<TE>   "Her range is broad," he said. "She's comfortable reporting on
everything from Washington politics to popular culture."</TE>
<TE>   And while NPR has long been a groundbreaking venue for
women--Wertheimer was the first woman to anchor a broadcast network's
election night coverage, for example--Norris, an African American,
becomes one of the network's few hosts of color.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased that Michele will bring diversity to the show,
but it's not something that would drive a decision like this," Drake
said. And, Norris added: "All newsrooms benefit from diversity of all
kinds. I'll do all I can to help bring new voices to the broadcast."</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up, I know what it's like to turn on the TV and not
always see people who look like you," or turn on the radio and not
hear people speaking from your same perspective, she said. So she
wants listeners to "turn on the dial and hear something of
themselves. I think that's important, and I think NPR realizes that."</TE>
<TE>   Inskeep, 34, joined NPR in 1996 and has covered both presidential
campaigns since then, several airline crashes, the Sept. 11 attack on
the Pentagon, the civil war in Colombia and the defeat of the
Taliban. He also has filled in as host on several NPR shows, but
joked, "I've been reluctant to get into hosting, because it's not
like honest work."</TE>
<TE>   He succeeds Lisa Simeone, who left "Weekend All Things Considered"
in March and now hosts NPR's "World of Opera."</TE>
<TE>   "He's really developed as an on-air presence," Drake said, "and
he's a good interviewer, and he has a sharp and skeptical mind."</TE>
<TE>   Inskeep, who takes over the show Nov. 1, said he wants the weekend
program to cover a broad base of topics, but added, "we have no
choice but to focus on the looming war."</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to know what's on the minds of people in the Muslim
world," he said. But he also wants to cover less weighty topics "and
do a story about Wilco, this really cool band that broke up."</TE>
<TE>   "That part of it is going to be cool," he said, but the element
that's both thrilling and intimidating is, "you just cover
everything. That scares me, in a way."</TE>
<TE>   While covering the Defense Department, he said, he's attained a
knowledge and comfort level that comes from focusing on a single
beat. "It's a little daunting to think you've got to have that
expertise for the whole world."</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to the network, to NPR, to make 'All Things
Considered' a great program seven days a week," he said, "and I
intend to help them do that."</TE>

<HD>Forget 'Must-See TV'; Series Vying for 'Must-Wear' Label</HD>
<DH>Fashion* This fall's new shows are trying to pick up the
slack, with styles for hip teens, cool crime investigators and
suburban moms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY HEVRDEJS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debra McGuire knows all about the thought and brainstorming that go
into dressing TV characters. She has spent eight years dressing
Rachel, Phoebe, Monica, Ross, Joey and Chandler for NBC's "Friends."</LD>
<LD>   That the show influenced fashion (and hair) on the streets doesn't
completely surprise McGuire, who has a store in Pacific Palisades and
a handbag line.</LD>
<LD>   "I think what 'Friends' did then--like 'Sex and the City'--was
extremely radical. It created an environment that people wanted to be
part of. They wanted to hang out in the loft, in the coffee shop and
to carry the handbags."</LD>
<TE>   Although movies were influencing clothing long before television,
it is television's daily presence in people's lives that gives it so
much influence on fashion, says Mark-Evan Blackman, an assistant
professor and chairman of the department of menswear at the Fashion
Institute of Technology in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to television, people didn't realize how other people
lived," he says. "My mother grew up in Harlem and she said, 'We
didn't realize we were poor until a neighbor got a television.' "</TE>
<TE>   MTV took imitation several steps further.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point, if you were a middle-class kid in Nebraska, you
weren't wearing oversized jeans, hats on backward and large logo
T-shirts. That all changed with MTV," Blackman says. Now, "someone
can get in their car and drive from Boston to Laguna Beach and ...
every 14-year-old girl will be dressed alike.</TE>
<TE>   "That is because of the power of television."</TE>
<TE>   But with "Friends" beginning its fade-out (this probably will be
the last season), and "Sex and the City" on a maternity leave of
sorts (for Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon), are there any new
shows this season that might pick up the fashion slack?</TE>
<TE>   If any theme is emerging so far, it's vintage and it's rich
(sometimes too rich for the salaries that the characters probably
would collect, but we're not talking reality TV here).</TE>
<TE>   In CBS' drama "CSI: Miami," costume designer Cynthia Bergstrom
went darker than the South Florida stereotype.</TE>
<TE>   "Because pastels were done before on 'Miami Vice,' I didn't want
the [new] show to replicate that whatsoever. I wanted deeper, richer
tones," Bergstrom says.</TE>
<TE>   They may be mucking around in homicides, but that doesn't mean
Bergstrom can't dress crime-scene investigator Horatio Caine (David
Caruso) in Helmut Lang suits and richly colored shirts from Prada and
Gucci. And you can expect Bergstrom to dress the "serious and
sophisticated" DNA specialist Megan Donner (Kim Delaney) in Chloe,
Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Theory.</TE>
<TE>   Over at Fox, the drama "Fastlane" has costume designer Julie
Schklair outfitting undercover cops in Guess, Hugo Boss and Donna
Karan.</TE>
<TE>   Tiffani Thiessen's character, Billie, "is very androgynous--sexy,
edgy," Schklair says. For the guys, when "they are wearing suits, we
keep their shirts untucked and open-necked."</TE>
<TE>   The message that clothes send not only to the streets but also
about the characters is not lost on television executive Susanne
Daniels.</TE>
<TE>   She had a hand in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," a show that gave
teens more than fashion inspiration in Sarah Michelle Gellar's Buffy
and Alyson Hannigan's Willow. Now, Daniels is executive producer for
NBC's comedy "Hidden Hills."</TE>
<TE>   So, how does she go from outfitting hip, cool teens to couples
living the suburban life?</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the blue jeans, Daniels says, there was debate over walking
the line between an image of "a good parent, yet still young and
sexy."</TE>
<TE>   If you want some cues for yourself, consider that character
Belinda (Kristin Bauer) showed up in khaki capris to help coach
softball. "It was really important that she look hot, but not over
the top," Daniels says. "Shorts was trying too hard."</TE>

company.</TE>

<KH>All That Jazz</KH>
<HD>Bebop Roots, and So Much More</HD>
<DH>Sheila Jordan's first L.A. appearance in more than a decade
reflects her highly eclectic choices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Singer Sheila Jordan remembers the exact moment when she decided what
her life's work would be.</LD>
<LD>   "I sang all the time when I was a little kid," she recalls. "But I
didn't know what kind of music I wanted to sing until I heard Charlie
Parker. It was on one of those old Savoy 78s, I think--Charlie Parker
and His Re-Boppers. And as soon as I heard it I said, 'Oh, that's it.
That's the music I want to devote the rest of my life to. Whether I
sing it or just support it or whatever.' "</LD>
<LD>   Jordan has remained remarkably true to that childhood vision.
Although she has never had the audience reach of, say, an Ella
Fitzgerald or a Diana Krall, she has always been highly regarded by
musicians and critics. And in her role as a vocal instructor in the
jazz program at the City University of New York, she has had--and
continues to have--a powerful impact upon a generation of young
artists.</LD>
<TE>   This week Jordan is making her first local appearance in more than
a decade, singing with pianist Steve Kuhn at the Jazz Bakery through
Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   She has always reached in many directions for her material, and
her opening set Wednesday night was no exception. Jordan sang an odd,
off-the-wall rendering, with words, of Tom Harrell's "Buffalo Wings,"
then dipped into some of the Native American chanting that is part of
her own personal heritage as an introduction to "Jazz Child." Moving
in a different direction, she found the atmospheric subtleties in
Jimmy Webb's "The Moon's a Harsh Mistress" and combined her own
"Ballad for Miles" with a touching, highly personal rendering of "My
Funny Valentine."</TE>
<TE>   Between numbers, she chatted amiably with her listeners, careful
to identify each of her songs and their composers, for the music
students in the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Her musical sensibility is rooted in bebop. For the Detroit-born
Jordan, raised in coal mining country, the music was both a
revelation and an escape. And Charlie "Bird" Parker was the catalyst
for her musical growth.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I actually saw Bird, in person, was when he came
to the Club El Cino," she says. "I was determined to get in to see
him, but when I tried, the manager just said I should go home and do
my homework, even though I'd forged my mother's birth certificate to
get in. But we were just kids, so we snuck out into the alley behind
the club to hear him. I remember that Tommy Flanagan, the piano
player, was with us too. And it was incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Her connection with the inner sanctum of bebop became somewhat
more direct in 1952, when she married pianist Duke Jordan, who had
worked with Parker in the late '40s. (They were divorced in 1962.)
But until the early '60s, her own singing was largely relegated to
performances in small Greenwich Village clubs, honing her highly
personal style. In 1962 she became one of the rare vocalists to
record for Blue Note. That album was followed by a remarkable version
of "You Are My Sunshine" on a George Russell album--a rendering that
blended the dark perils of her own childhood with her growing efforts
to bring an instrumental-like improvisational freedom to the process
of jazz singing.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone once asked me," Jordan says with a laugh, "if I do some
of the offbeat things I do--like occasionally singing solo with just
bass accompaniment--to be different. And I told him, 'No, I just do
the things that I hear in my head.' "</TE>
<TE>   Those "things" can range from intense, almost Middle
Easternscatting to dark, throaty tones, from whimsical humor in
lightweight vocalise numbers to storytelling in ballad standards--but
storytelling that often puts a completely new slant upon familiar
items, both musically and lyrically. Audiences are sometimes startled
by Jordan's musical unpredictability, by her insistence upon
maintaining improvisational spontaneity--refusing to do a number the
same way twice.</TE>
<TE>   "I know, I know," says Jordan. "After all these years [she will be
74 on Nov. 18], I'm still pretty much of an underground act. But when
I first heard Bird, when I first decided to devote my life to this
kind of music, it wasn't with the idea that I'd just imitate what
somebody else was doing. Bird inspired me to find my own path. And
I've been doing it that way much too long for me to do anything
different now.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like what they say in the program," concludes
Jordan, who has been drug- and alcohol-free for 17 years. "You have
to give it back to keep it. It's the same way with music. Which is
why I love to teach. And which is why I know that the only way I can
keep my music is for me to give myself to it completely."</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Jordan and Steve Kuhn perform at the Jazz Bakery, 3233
Helms Ave., Culver City, through Sunday. Shows at 8 and 9:30 p.m. $25
admission. (310) 271-9039.</TE>
<TE>   Definitive Jazz: Two of the most prestigious jazz labels, Blue
Note and Verve, have taken the rare step of joining forces to create
a series of albums gathering selections from the archives of both
companies. Appropriately, the series is called "The Definitive." Not
completely inclusive (many artists recorded for a wide range of
companies), the compilations nonetheless offer a wide reach,
embracing not only selections from Blue Note and Verve but also from
such associated catalogs as Capitol, Decca, EmArcy, Pacific Jazz,
Roost and Roulette.</TE>
<TE>   Each company is releasing seven CDs. The Verve releases feature
such artists as Clifford Brown, Stan Getz, Joe Henderson, George
Shearing, Dinah Washington and Joe Williams. The Blue Note collection
features Cannonball Adderley, Chet Baker, Nat King Cole, Bud Powell,
Jimmy Smith, Art Tatum and McCoy Tyner.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the more obvious inclusions, there are some offbeat
items as well: Nat Cole with Benny Carter, Coleman Hawkins and Max
Roach on the spirited "Riffamarole"; Bud Powell's only quintet studio
date, with Sonny Rollins, Fats Navarro and Roy Haynes; Cannonball
Adderley romping through "King Porter Stomp" in a Gil Evans
arrangement for a 14-piece band; a 1962 pairing of George Shearing
and a youthful Gary Burton on "Over the Rainbow"; a similarly early
(1963) recording by Joe Henderson, performing his "Recorda Me"; Stan
Getz playing "Once Upon a Time" from the too rarely heard Eddie
Sauter orchestral work "Focus"; Clifford Brown and Sarah Vaughan
swinging together improvisationally in "Lullaby of Birdland"; and Joe
Williams superbly displaying his ballad chops in "What Are You Doing
New Year's Eve?"</TE>
<TE>   The 14 albums, in total, don't exactly make for a complete jazz
collection on disc, but they do provide a solid foundation--as well
as a set of music that offers continual re-listening pleasures.</TE>
<TE>   Guitar Tribute: John Collins, who died a year ago, was a member of
the Nat King Cole Trio for a decade and a half, during which his
Charlie Christian-influenced guitar playing was an integral element
in the smooth Cole sound. Beginning Oct. 20 at 2 p.m. at Musicians
Hall in the Musicians Union building at 817 N. Vine St. in Hollywood,
a five-hour concert will raise funds for the Collins Memorial
Scholarship Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The anticipated roster of performers, topped by singer Nancy
Wilson, is an all-star assemblage, particularly rich with guitarists,
including Anthony Wilson, Russell Malone, John Pisano, Al Viola, Ron
Eschete, Doug McDonald, Barry Zweig and Joe DiOrio. Donations of $20
at the door.</TE>

<HD>'Columbine's' Aim Slightly Off</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 6 a.m. on April 20, 1999, just hours before they killed a dozen
classmates and a teacher at Columbine High School, Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold went bowling. Was there a connection? Is it logical to
blame the sport or, for that matter, any single thing for America's
spectacularly violent nature? "Bowling for Columbine" doesn't have
the answers and really doesn't expect to find them. For documentary
writer-director Michael Moore, the asking, as always, is what's
important.</LD>
<LD>   Moore made his reputation trying to ask questions of an elusive
Roger Smith, chairman of General Motors, in his 1989 documentary
"Roger &amp; Me," a puckish film that is apparently still the
highest-grossing narrative documentary.</LD>
<LD>   In "Bowling for Columbine," his troubling and troublesome look at
America's gun culture, Moore (who has gone on to write best-selling
books like the current "Stupid White Men") is as much a provocateur
as he is a filmmaker. That style has charms, and limitations.</LD>
<TE>   Moore's concern about issues is genuine, and his showboating
technique is often entertaining. But he is not the most organized
person in the world, and there is a scattershot randomness about this
film that is both its essence and a source of frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Like a sociopolitical magpie, Moore can't resist including all
kinds of amusing yet haphazard stuff that connects loosely at best
with his themes, like a 1950s TV commercial for the Sound-O-Power, a
toy gun that sounds real, and a clip of comedian Chris Rock doing a
riff on what a different world this would be if bullets were priced
at $5,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   Moore also has an unerring radar for eccentricity, for turning up
strange individuals like Columbine's bowling team and the man who was
No. 2 on a domestic bomb-threat list in Oscoda, Mich., who felt
chagrined that he hadn't placed higher. "I wanted to be No. 1," the
man confesses. "It's an ego thing."</TE>
<TE>   With its picture of America as a nation of wayward and well-armed
wackos, "Bowling for Columbine" was sure to gain a sympathetic ear
from Europeans. True to form, it was the first documentary in
competition at Cannes in 46 years, where the jury awarded it a
special 55th anniversary prize.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite its lapses and despite being all over the map,
"Bowling for Columbine" does confront the intractable issue of
violence, and there's not a lot of competition in that arena. Moore's
shambling on-screen persona camouflages his fierceness and
persistence, his conviction that, as the father of a Columbine victim
puts it, there's something wrong in this country when a child can
grab a gun and kill.</TE>
<TE>   Moore starts "Bowling" with some riffs on the state he grew up in,
Michigan, "a gun lover's paradise." He turns out to be a rarity for a
liberal, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Assn. as well as the
recipient of an NRA award as a teenager. And he takes us on a tour of
some of Michigan's stranger firearms byways, like a barbershop that
sells ammunition and a savings and loan that offers a free rifle
("More Bang for Your Buck") with certain accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the film concentrates, as much as it is able to concentrate,
on the shootings at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo. We see
chilling footage of the massacre from the school's security camera
tapes, talk to "South Park" co-creator Matt Stone, once a Littleton
resident, and find out that Lockheed Martin, one of the world's
largest arms manufacturers, is headquartered in the town.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more absorbing sections involves a search for a reason
why Americans perpetrate so much violence, why our gun-related
homicides are so astronomical compared with the rest of the world's.
USC professor Barry Glassner talks persuasively about our culture of
fear and the way money is made from it, and Moore takes a diverting
trip to Canada, a country with lots of guns but such a different
culture that even city dwellers typically don't lock their doors.
(Moore tries some random doors and finds them open.)</TE>
<TE>   "Bowling for Columbine's" final and most focused section involves
a shooting in Moore's hometown of Flint that especially galvanized
him: the school killing of a 6-year-old first-grader by another
6-year-old. Moore looks into the "welfare to work" program that kept
the shooter's mother separated from her son, challenges Kmart
officials about their chain's sale of ammunition and, in the film's
climax, confronts Charlton Heston about why he came to Flint for a
pro-gun rally just after the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   What does all this add up to? Perhaps nothing, certainly nothing
conclusive. But although his approach is scattershot, so to speak,
Moore hits some targets. Anything that coaxes us into thinking about
why we are the way we are, even as imperfectly as "Bowling for
Columbine" does, is an energizing change of pace.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R for some violent images and language. Times
guideline: chilling Columbine murder footage.</TE>

<HD>In 'Tuck,' a Poetic Fable Sensitively Adapted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Tuck Everlasting," a sweeping romantic fable about love and
mortality, targets an audience of girls in their early teens, but has
been made with such skill and sensitivity that its appeal spans
generations. It surrounds two talented and ingratiating young
newcomers to the big screen, Alexis Bledel and Jonathan Jackson, with
veteran actors Sissy Spacek, William Hurt, Ben Kingsley, Amy Irving
and Victor Garber, all of whom excel in crucial roles.</LD>
<LD>   Director Jay Russell, who did such a winning job in bringing the
late Willie Morris' "My Dog Skip" to the screen, does the same with
Natalie Babbitt's heralded novel for young people, which has been
deftly adapted by Jeffrey Lieber and James V. Hart. Bledel, best
known for TV's "Gilmore Girls," plays Winnie Foster, a 15-year-old
chafing at the restrictions placed on her by a formidable and proper
mother (Irving). The year is 1914, and the setting is a Western
wilderness outside the small town of Treegap. The Fosters are the
rich aristocrats of the region and live in a fine Victorian mansion
in a clearing next to the forest they own.</LD>
<LD>   Despite its rural setting, the Foster home is surrounded by a
formal wrought-iron fence as if it were in the heart of town.
Headstrong Winnie feels increasingly imprisoned by that fence, and
one day she moves beyond it to explore the surrounding woods; she
soon encounters Jackson's Jesse Tuck.</LD>
<TE>   The two are instantly taken with each other, but when Jesse's
older brother Miles (Scott Bairstow) suddenly appears, he takes the
story in an unexpected direction. There is every reason to suspect
that Jesse, Miles and their parents (Spacek and Hurt) are moonshiners
who want to keep their activities secret. "Tuck Everlasting" emerges
as a meditation on the value of mortality and the paramount
importance of pursuing a life well-lived. It is also a tremendously
evocative film. It captures an America in transition, when a
predominantly rural nation gave way to an increasingly urban society.
The realization that the Tucks will find it increasingly hard to live
in splendid isolation in an Eden on Earth is inescapable.</TE>
<TE>   In re-creating this crucial time of transition in American life,
production designer Tony Burrough and his team have done their
homework. The Fosters still live in well-upholstered Victorian
comfort, which was the case with many wealthy families at that time.
Even though their home has been electrified, they have not given up
their kerosene lamps because electricity was still unreliable,
especially in rural areas. Similarly, when Spacek's Mae Tuck is seen
making her way down Treegap's main street in her horse-drawn wagon,
she encounters a goodly scattering of automobiles. Mae dresses in
timeless farm-woman attire; the gowns designed by Carol Ramsey for
Irving's regal Mrs. Foster could have come from Worth of Paris. James
L. Carter's camera work brings a uniform glow to the film, a quality
enhanced by William Ross' romantic score. Elisabeth Shue serves as
the film's unseen narrator.</TE>
<TE>   Spacek and Hurt, and Irving and Garber offer contrasting portraits
of parental love, with Bairstow's troubled Miles emerging as the most
complex figure among the younger generation. Kingsley, a mysterious
stranger in a yellow suit, is an unsettling shrewd and insinuating
presence.</TE>
<TE>   As for Bledel, who displays the focus and intensity Reese
Witherspoon radiated from the start, and Jackson, who is as relaxed
and open as he is handsome, they couldn't ask for a better project
than "Tuck Everlasting."</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for some violence. Times guidelines. Themes of
death and mortality.</TE>

<HD>Sharks and Jets: Musical History</HD>
<DH>Movies* Cast and crew from the 1961 classic 'West Side
Story' gather in Hollywood for a reunion screening in honor of their
director, Robert Wise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING and RACHEL USLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The leader of the Sharks and the leader of the Jets, sitting side by
side. Bernardo and Riff brought together by a common affection for
Robert Wise, director of the Oscar-winning movie musical "West Side
Story."</LD>
<LD>   "We are forever in his debt for the opportunity of a lifetime,"
said George Chakiris, who won a best supporting actor Oscar as
Bernardo. "He believed in what we were doing, and it created a bond
that has made us a family to this day." From the audience, a
significant number of that reunited family, including Oscar-winning
Rita Moreno (Anita), Russ Tamblyn (Riff) and Marni Nixon (the
uncredited singing voice of Natalie Wood's Maria) and 19 assorted
Jets and Sharks cheered in agreement.</LD>
<LD>   It was one of several expressions of appreciation during the
reunion screening Wednesday of the 1961 musical based on the Leonard
Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim 1957 Broadway musical. Billed as "A
tribute to director Robert Wise from the cast and crew," the
screening at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood showed off an improved
picture and sound that wowed even Wise, now 88.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm glad I had the chance to see it again on the big screen, the
way it's meant to be seen," he said. During the screening, people
snapped along with the Jets and clapped at each cast member's
entrance and after each number.</TE>
<TE>   In the panel discussion that followed, Wise, Moreno, Chakiris,
Tamblyn and Nixon, as well as assistant director Bob Relyea and
executive producer Walter Mirisch, took turns expressing their
gratitude at being part of the film. "I must comment on the
extraordinary privilege I feel tonight to be reminded again of the
genius of the creators of this material," Mirisch said.</TE>
<TE>   Ernest Lehman, the screenwriter, sent a note in his absence: "I
got caught in the middle of a vicious fight between the Jets and the
Sharks and luckily came away with only a broken ankle. From my
wheelchair, I salute you all, especially Bob Wise and the late Jerry
Robbins [choreographer and co-director]. They took a remarkable group
of actors and made magic with them."</TE>
<TE>While acknowledging both the absent Richard Beymer, who played Tony,
and Wood, who died in 1981, the panel also mentioned some of the
unsung heroes of the film. Moreno paid tribute to the hard work of
Relyea, who was "a shepherd for us toddlers." Nixon thanked Johnny
Green, the conductor, and Saul Chaplin, the music supervisor. All of
them acknowledged the work of Simon Oakland, in the antagonist role
of Lieutenant Schrank. But they also agreed how fresh the story still
felt. Mirisch, who said the play's theme of racial discord "was one
of the great attractions of filming it," felt that "40 years later,
it is still a radical and important film."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the reunion, Wise, Tamblyn, Moreno and Chakiris
reminisced about the classic and its place in film history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Jerome Robbins Factor</TE>
<TE>   Robert Wise: The company came to me and asked if I would like to
do "West Side Story." I said yes. I saw it in New York and I felt it
was very important to get Jerry Robbins on the film because it was
his baby. He directed and choreographed not only the Broadway
production, but the touring company and the London production. He was
unwilling to come out here unless he could have more to do with the
film than just choreography. I said to the company (United Artists),
"Why don't you let him direct?" They said, "No, he's never directed a
picture." I went home that night and figuratively took my director's
hat off and put my on my producer's hat and asked the question:
What's the best thing for the film? I went back to them the next day
and said, "I thought this over and if there is some way we can work
it out, I'll go along with it."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it was decided that he would be in charge, and the main
director, so to speak, of all the musical parts of the thing, and I
would be there on stage with him to make any suggestions that might
help him. That worked fine for about 60% of the movie. We were
getting further and further behind schedule and over budget. The
company was very unhappy. They attributed the fact that we were way
over schedule and budget to the co-director [Robbins] and they
insisted that he leave the film. Fortunately for me, he had rehearsed
all the other dance numbers we hadn't shot and all but one of his
assistants stayed on to help me, and his rehearsal pianist also
stayed on.</TE>
<TE>   Rita Moreno: It was hard working with Robbins because he worked
you so hard. The other problem was that he was extremely sadistic.
All the dances were done in sections. For "America," we had, I guess,
about three or five sections and he would have a different version
for each section. So he would say, "Let me see version A of section
2." We were learning three different dances with some variation. That
is what made it confusing because some of the steps would remain the
same and others would be changed. It was really wild. That being
said, I would drop my drawers to work with him again. He was a
genius. I was one of the people he was not mean to. I never quite
understood that.</TE>
<TE>   George Chakiris: No matter what anybody says about Jerry, you
can't take away his genius. He was such a perfectionist, not only for
the people he was working with but also himself as well. That's why
things took longer because, to Jerry, once you got a great take on
something, there was always a better way to do it or any way to try
it. He was never satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Getting the Role</TE>
<TE>   Russ Tamblyn: I was under contract to MGM. This was not an MGM
movie but MGM let me go and test for the part of Tony. I tested with
several girls and I also tested with Michael Callan who played Riff
on Broadway and I was playing Tony. What happened was my agent called
me and said, "They made up their minds and they have taken Richard
Beymer for the role of Tony and they offered you the part of Riff but
MGM has turned it down." I said, "What? I would love to do the part
of Riff."</TE>
<TE>   So I went to the [head of MGM] and he said, "Russ you have a good
reputation here and in 'West Side Story' you have to say all of these
lines like 'My father wears a dress' and we don't think this would be
good for you. So we have booked you into another movie called 'Where
the Boys Are' with Connie Francis." I had to beg them. I almost
didn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   Rita Moreno: I auditioned and screen-tested just like every other
girl with brown eyes did in Hollywood. But I had made the only two
movies Jerome Robbins ever made--"The King and I" and "West Side
Story." After "The King and I," I think it was Jerry who brought me
up with Bob Wise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Love That Bob</TE>
<TE>   Rita Moreno: Robert Wise is a lovely man. He was very patient and
very low-key. What's not to love. The contrast with him and Robbins
was kind of astonishing.</TE>
<TE>   George Chakiris: He makes you feel wonderfully comfortable, and he
gives you kind of a free rein. If you have questions, he has an
answer to give you. He gives you the time that you need. It is really
part of who he is as a person as well.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Tamblyn: He's good with actors who, like myself, don't like a
lot of direction. He hires people he thinks are capable of doing the
job. For actors who need a lot of direction, he is not good with
[them]. They seem disappointed. Bob Wise gives you a little taste and
points you in the right direction and then you are on your own.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Legacy</TE>
<TE>   Rita Moreno: Someone was asking me the other day, "When you made
the movie, did you have a clue [it would become such a classic]?" I
said, "We knew we were in a very special and unique movie." It wasn't
a musical that had glittery costumes in it. No names to speak of--the
movie became the star. Who knew? Here we are 40 years later and we
are in this astonishing classic that broke every kind of rule about
what musicals should be in movies and has yet to be equaled, as far
as I am concerned.</TE>
<TE>   It meant a great deal to every Hispanic actor I have ever met.
Benjamin Bratt said to me, "If I hadn't seen you, I would never ever
have tried. But I figured, if you can do it, I can do it." That is
quite a tribute.</TE>

<HD>'West' Heading South</HD>
<DH>TV* Despite another Emmy win, 'West Wing's' ratings are the
lowest since its first season, but it still wins its time slot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite claiming a third consecutive Emmy last month as best dramatic
series, NBC's "The West Wing" appears to be losing some clout with
its Nielsen constituency.</LD>
<LD>   The last two weeks the political drama has posted the lowest
ratings since its first season in 1999. Viewing is off sharply
compared to a year ago--when the audience soared above 20 million
after a topical episode regarding tensions in the Middle East--and
has declined each week this fall. Wednesday's episode still won its
time period but slipped to 16 million viewers, based on Nielsen Media
Research estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, the program is looking particularly vulnerable among the
younger demographics that the networks use as currency in their
dealings with advertisers. On Wednesday, for example, 6.8 million of
its viewers fell into the 18 to 49 age bracket, per Nielsen data,
well behind the 8.3 million viewers in that category watching ABC's
unscripted dating show "The Bachelor," which attracted 12.8 million
viewers overall.</LD>
<TE>   If "The West Wing" is experiencing a ratings slump, it has picked
an inopportune time, since NBC and Warner Bros. Television, which
produces the show, have yet to hammer out a new contract that would
extend beyond this season.</TE>
<TE>   Before the fall began, sources were anticipating that "West Wing"
would command a huge raise from the nearly $2 million an episode the
network now pays the studio. A significant increase remains likely,
especially since CBS and ABC are both said to have tacitly expressed
interest in acquiring the program should NBC balk at Warner Bros.'
asking price.</TE>
<TE>   NBC officials declined to discuss the show's ratings on Thursday
but have long pointed out that the program garners premium rates from
sponsors because it delivers a disproportionately high number of
affluent, better-educated viewers--ranking first among prime-time
programs in the percentage of viewers with an income level above
$75,000.</TE>
<TE>   " 'The West Wing's' qualitative and quantitative merit is still
quite high, particularly among the upscale audience and light TV
viewers," said John Rash, senior vice president and director of
broadcast negotiations at Campbell Mithun, a Minneapolis-based
advertising agency.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the program's blockbuster credentials and long-term
durability appear less assured than they did a year ago, which could
somewhat weaken Warner Bros.' negotiating position.</TE>
<TE>   Competition has become particularly intense on Wednesdays, with
rival networks almost uniformly seeking to counter "West Wing" by
targeting younger viewers. In addition to "The Bachelor" and CBS'
"The Amazing Race," this week saw the WB network introduce "Birds of
Prey," a superhero series that drew an impressive 7.6 million viewers
and fared well among young adults.</TE>
<TE>   "Wednesday at 9 o'clock is arguably the most competitive time
period on television," said Warner Bros. Television President Peter
Roth, suggesting that some erosion in the program's younger audience
was to be expected.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, AOL Time Warner units produce five of the six programs in
that hour: "Birds of Prey" is produced by Warner Bros., as is the Fox
series "Fastlane," which is currently being preempted by playoff
baseball. "The Bachelor" and UPN's "The Twilight Zone" come from
other studio subsidiaries.</TE>
<TE>   "Creatively, the show could not be in better shape," Roth added,
referring to the present story line following President Bartlet's
reelection efforts, which will conclude in November.</TE>
<TE>   Although "The Bachelor" represents a clear bright spot for ABC,
meanwhile, the network sought to address its rating woes elsewhere on
Thursday, confirming an overhaul of its prime-time schedule that
alters three nights and includes canceling the new dramatic series
"Push, Nevada" and "That Was Then."</TE>
<TE>   The changes will include moving "The Drew Carey Show" and "Whose
Line Is It Anyway?" from Mondays to Fridays at 9 p.m. where "That Was
Then" aired and shifting the detective series "Monk" to Monday
nights.</TE>

<HD>Scorsese-Spielberg Match Called Off</HD>
<DH>Movies* Each had a project with Leonardo DiCaprio set for
Dec. 25, but Miramax rescheduled to avoid rivalry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MASTERS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The celebrity death match pitting the lightweight Leonardo DiCaprio
against the heavyweight Leonardo DiCaprio has been called off.</LD>
<LD>   Miramax has decided to move Martin Scorsese's costly and
long-in-the-making epic "Gangs of New York," which features DiCaprio
in a central role, from Dec. 25 to an earlier date in December that
had not been determined by midday Thursday. That means Scorsese's
gritty tale of gang warfare in 19th century Manhattan will not go
head-to-head with Steven Spielberg's "Catch Me if You Can," a holiday
confection that also stars DiCaprio.</LD>
<LD>   "There are challenges to having the two films on the same date,"
Miramax spokesman Matthew Hiltzik said. "Whatever the eventual date
will be, we're extremely confident in the film. This is one of the
great times of the year to release the film, and there's plenty of
opportunity for this and other quality projects to perform well."</LD>
<TE>   At DreamWorks, Miramax's decision brought relief after months of
tension over the clashing dates. "We didn't like having to share
Leo's audience with that movie, and we also didn't think it was
seemly to have two of America's greatest directors square off against
each other," DreamWorks executive Walter Parkes said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the two directors have a long and complicated friendship.
Their vastly different styles are on display in these two films,
which feature dramatically different DiCaprios. In "Gangs," he is
bulked up to play a grubby street fighter. He is trimmed down and
squeaky clean for his turn in "Catch Me if You Can" as an early-'60s
teenage con artist who poses as a pilot, doctor and lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   The holiday season is packed with high-profile movies, and finding
a new date for "Gangs" could prove difficult. On Dec. 6, Warner Bros.
releases "Analyze That," the sequel to its hit comedy with Billy
Crystal and Robert De Niro. The following weekend, Paramount launches
the latest installment of "Star Trek." And on the 18th, New Line will
open "The Two Towers," the second episode in its "Lord of the Rings"
trilogy.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the industry are wondering how Miramax can handle its
extraordinary number of films set for holiday release. Aside from
"Gangs," a few films have generated early buzz. "Chicago," a musical
starring Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere, already is being mentioned
as an Oscar contender. Other Miramax openings include "Confessions of
a Dangerous Mind," directed by George Clooney; Roberto Benigni's
"Pinocchio"; and "The Quiet American," a Philip Noyce-directed drama.</TE>
<TE>   Industry executives said head-to-head competition between "Gangs
of New York" and "Catch Me if You Can" wouldn't have been good for
either project. But most believed that the underdog in such a contest
would have been Miramax's "Gangs," with its violence and
length--approaching two hours and 40 minutes. And the stakes are
high. The picture has a budget substantially in excess of $100
million, making it by far the most expensive film Miramax has made.
It's arriving a year late.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks' "Catch Me if You Can" cost about half as much, and
Spielberg shot it in 55 days. At about two hours, it is shorter than
"Gangs" and considerably sweeter. And it pairs Spielberg with Tom
Hanks, one of the most bankable stars. Finally, there's DiCaprio,
looking much as he did when he made legions of female fans swoon in
"Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   "Gangs of New York" doesn't lack star power. Along with DiCaprio,
it has Cameron Diaz and Daniel Day-Lewis, whose performance may put
him in Oscar contention. But the characters have an eccentric period
look, and they are coated with meticulously re-created 19th century
grime. As one producer observed, "Nobody's cute in 'Gangs of New
York.' "</TE>
<TE>   Miramax spokesman Hiltzik says early tracking shows that "Gangs"
will appeal to a broad audience. "An action film with romance
starring Leo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and Daniel Day-Lewis, directed by
Martin Scorsese with music by U2, has tremendous, widespread appeal,"
he says. Research shows that the potential audience has an
exceptionally high awareness of the film before Miramax has run the
first ad for it.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Sherak, a partner at Revolution Studios, thinks "Gangs" can
perform strongly, especially now that it has been moved. "It looks
like something that I want to see," he says. "It has a cachet to it."
But he expects that the picture, with its dark themes and violence,
will appeal primarily to big-city audiences, and that would limit the
box office potential to about $100 million, he says. "It can't do as
much business as a picture that plays everywhere," he predicts.</TE>
<TE>   "Catch Me if You Can," on the other hand, looks like a film with
appeal in the heartland as well as in urban areas. "If a movie is
going to work big, it works from the middle [of the country] out,"
Sherak says.</TE>
<TE>   Most industry watchers were surprised that Miramax took as long as
it did to move the film to a different date. One prominent agent
speculated that Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein was reluctant to move
"Gangs" in part because of the ongoing rivalry between his company
and DreamWorks. The two have engaged in bitter Academy Awards battles
for several years.</TE>
<TE>   There were rumors that DiCaprio was so upset over the conflict
that he threatened to back away from publicity chores for either
movie unless some accommodation was reached. Ken Sunshine, the star's
publicist, says those reports were "completely bogus."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, says one prominent agent, Weinstein had no choice but
to yield. "Harvey would alienate everybody in the whole world if he
were trying to throw another Leo DiCaprio movie out there on
Christmas Day," he says. "It's blood sport setting these dates, but
there is a certain amount of cooperation that has to go on with these
studios when it comes to releasing movies with the same stars."</TE>
<TE>   Miramax contends that Weinstein set "Gangs of New York" for
release Dec. 25 after DreamWorks principal Jeffrey Katzenberg assured
him that "Catch Me if You Can" would open in November. DreamWorks
denies that Katzenberg made such a promise. But if Weinstein had
consulted a release schedule, he would have seen that the Spielberg
movie was parked on Dec. 25 when he announced the "Gangs" date.
Miramax contends that Weinstein set that date without checking. On
Thursday, Katzenberg said, "We're going to root for them in every way
we can."</TE>
<TE>   One source with knowledge of Weinstein's actions says he and
Scorsese hastily agreed on the Christmas date just before the Cannes
Film Festival in the face of mounting media interest in the progress
of the much-delayed "Gangs." "I think they figured they'd work it out
or they'd win," this insider says. "It was a mistake." (Scorsese's
publicist, Lois Smith, said Scorsese never involves himself in
scheduling decisions. And Hiltzik said the date had been set weeks in
advance of Cannes.)</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks says it never considered moving "Catch Me if You Can"
from its date. But the studio clearly wanted "Gangs" to move. To that
end, Spielberg did something he had never done in his storied career:
He cut together 14 minutes of footage from his film to show to
selected members of the press. In other words, DreamWorks flashed its
poker hand to show that it wasn't bluffing.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Spielberg made a friendly gesture toward his old friend
Scorsese. When Scorsese couldn't get a Miramax-provided jet to the
recent Hollywood Film Festival Awards, Spielberg offered his plane.
Scorsese--still toiling over "Gangs of New York" in the editing
room--decided not to attend.</TE>
<TE>   The two directors and their projects have undergone a series of
twists. "Gangs" is a project that Scorsese had dreamed about making
for decades. Spielberg, on the other hand, did not intend to direct
"Catch Me if You Can." At one time, DreamWorks wanted Lasse Hallstrom
to take the helm. But the studio couldn't strike a deal with Miramax,
which would have had to release Hallstrom to take the assignment.
When DiCaprio committed to "Catch Me if You Can," DreamWorks delayed
the start of production so that he could finish filming "Gangs."
During that interlude, Spielberg decided to direct the film, and the
confrontation between the two directors inadvertently was set into
motion.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg and Scorsese have a long-standing relationship that an
executive who has worked with both describes as "friendly but
strained." When both were starting out, Spielberg was the one who
seemed to be at a disadvantage, according to Peter Biskind, author of
"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls." "Steven said to me at one point that
when he was coming up, he wanted to be Marty," Biskind said. "He
wanted to be an auteur." Spielberg, who had worked in television, was
"too studio" for Scorsese's crowd, Biskind said. According to
Biskind, Spielberg was so concerned about his artistic bona fides
that he briefly decided not to direct "Jaws." But after he
established himself as a box office titan, it was Scorsese's turn to
be concerned about his failure to make a highly commercial film,
according to executives familiar with both directors.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '90s, the two briefly switched roles. Three
executives familiar with the episode give the following account:
After Spielberg tried to develop "Schindler's List" without success,
he turned the project over to Scorsese, who commissioned screenwriter
Steven Zaillian to tackle it. Zaillian came up with a successful
approach, and Spielberg wanted the project back. Spielberg asked
Scorsese to attend a reading of another script--a reworking of the
1962 thriller "Cape Fear." Scorsese traded "Schindler's List" for the
presumably more commercial "Cape Fear" remake. As an incentive, one
of the executives said, Scorsese's deal gave him a percentage of the
film's gross for the first time--the kind of deal that had long been
a matter of routine for Spielberg. The directors' representatives
would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   The bargain paid off for Scorsese--to a point. "Cape Fear," which
pulled in $77 million at the box office, was the highest-grossing
film he has directed. But "Schindler" grossed $96 million. And in a
moment of considerable irony, Spielberg won the Academy Award for
best picture and director--both honors that have eluded Scorsese to
this day.</TE>

<HD>'Twelfth Night' With a Twang</HD>
<DH>The Globe Playhouse production moves the setting to
Kentucky coal-mining country with happy results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shakespeare is sent traveling through time so often that he deserves
some sort of cosmic frequent flier miles. His "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" might get transferred to colonial India, for instance, while
"The Taming of the Shrew" is sent packing for the Wild West.</LD>
<LD>   The writer and his plays usually hold up well, however, and the
new settings--more familiar to today's audiences than the ones
Shakespeare gave them--open the stories to easier understanding.</LD>
<LD>   A new staging of "Twelfth Night" is so successful in this regard
that it gets the audience smiling before the play has even begun.
Upon entering the Globe Playhouse in West Hollywood, theatergoers
find a mountain hoedown in progress, with lively folk songs spurring
some participants to break into foot-stomping dances.</LD>
<TE>   "An Appalachian Twelfth Night," as this Dancing Barefoot
production is called, is set in 1938 in Kentucky coal-mining country,
where the twangy dialect embraces the text (Appalachian is thought to
be a holdover of Scottish-flavored Elizabethan English).</TE>
<TE>   The story of separated twins, each thinking the other dead, finds
a comfortable home here. The female twin, Viola (Kelley Birney),
disguises herself in a man's cap and work jacket, and finds
employment with Duke Orsino (Gerald Hopkins), a mine foreman. Olivia
(Susan Brindley), the mourning countess who refuses to hear Orsino's
suits of love, is distraught over the deaths of her father and
brother in separate mining accidents.</TE>
<TE>   This is a time and place characterized by hard work and
perseverance. Then love sweeps in to make life strange and magical.</TE>
<TE>   Olivia, aching for comfort, falls for the sensitive, well-spoken,
male-garbed Viola. Viola, meanwhile, is in love with Orsino,
who--also thinking her a man--has taken her into his confidence.
(Worth the price of admission alone: the mix of embarrassment, panic
and choked desire in Birney's face as Viola finds herself talking
with Orsino while he takes a bath.)</TE>
<TE>   Also caught in love's snare is Olivia's puritanical steward,
Malvolio (Gene Gillette), rendered here as a starchy church deacon. A
ruse brings his repressed desire for Olivia to full flame, much to
the amusement of those playing the joke on him: the moonshine-loving
Sir Toby Belch (Robert L. Williams) and cohorts Sir Andrew Aguecheek
(Andrew Elvis Miller), the clown Feste (Sean Galuszka), serving woman
Maria (Mary Eileen O'Donnell) and fun-loving Fabian (Joel West), all
of whom keep running afoul of Malvolio.</TE>
<TE>   Playfully conceived by Williams and touchingly rendered by
director Susan Lambert, the staging further benefits from extensive
use of old-time folk music, under Rob Kendt's supervision. It's a
toe-tapping, laugh-spreading good time.</TE>
<TE>   "An Appalachian Twelfth Night," Globe Playhouse, 1107 N. Kings
Road, West Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends
Nov. 10. $20. (310) 285-5575. Running time: 2 hours, 45 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   ABC Makes a Home</LD>
<LD>   for 'Home Alone 4'</LD>
<TE>   After three theatrical outings, the "Home Alone" franchise is
moving to television. ABC said Thursday that it has scheduled a new
installment, "Home Alone 4," to air on "The Wonderful World of
Disney" on Nov. 3, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Weinberg will star as 11-year-old Kevin McCallister, and
French Stewart, co-star of the long-running sitcom "3rd Rock From the
Sun," will play his nemesis, Marv.</TE>
<TE>   It's the second sequel announcement for Stewart this week: Disney
said earlier that he'll star in "Inspector Gadget 2," a movie that
will go directly to video in March.</TE>

<TE>   Letterman at Crossroads in Indiana Suburb</TE>
<TE>   The City Council in Lawrence, Ind., an Indianapolis suburb,
unanimously approved a resolution this week renaming a portion of a
street after CBS late-night star--and Indianapolis native--David
Letterman.</TE>
<TE>   A portion of what used to be 59th Street near the former Fort
Harrison is now called David Drive. It crosses an existing street
called Letterman Road--named years ago for a hospital in San
Francisco--which runs through an area that once was part of the fort.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, there is an intersection of David Drive and Letterman
Road. Deputy Mayor Chuck Ricks said the signs are designed so that
the words "Drive" and "Road" will be small, allowing "David
Letterman" to stand out.</TE>

<TE>   Warm Homecoming</TE>
<TE>   for Ousted Director</TE>
<TE>   Simone Young returned to Sydney this week for the first time since
being ousted as music director of Opera Australia and got what
Melbourne's newspaper the Age described as a rousing response from
the audience when she attended a performance of "Carmen" at the
Sydney Opera House.</TE>
<TE>   Young had been here, conducting Los Angeles Opera's "Girl of the
Golden West," when she learned last month that the board had voted
unanimously not to renew her contract beyond 2003, saying her vision
for the company was too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   She expressed hope that her supporters would not take out their
anger on the company. "If people want to support me," she told the
Age, "then the best thing they can do is make sure my performances
are full, that all our performances are full."</TE>

<TE>   Florida Orchestra Reports Budget Surplus</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the financial tunes emanating from classical music
halls these days are negative. The Florida Orchestra reports that for
the fiscal year that ended in June, it had a surplus of $480,000 on
its cash budget of $7.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry as a whole suffered shock as the result of Sept.
11," the orchestra's executive director, Leonard Stone, told the St.
Petersburg Times. "Many orchestras took weeks to recover, some took
months to recover and some did not recover, with red ink all over the
place. Our sales held the line and even increased. Somehow, we didn't
experience anything from which we had to recover, and contributions
moved along at a steady pace."</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Orchestra may have benefited, however, from having
made course corrections the previous year, when it ran a $600,000
deficit and cut $650,000 from its budget to bring it into balance.</TE>

<TE>   New Look for London's Royal Festival Hall</TE>
<TE>   Royal Festival Hall, the 50-year-old home of the London
Philharmonic Orchestra, has received a $23.3-million lottery grant
for renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell said she was delighted by news of
the grant--about a quarter of the estimated cost of $83.7
million--and that it was "wonderful to see this project moving
ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Plans have been on the drawing board for six years. Some work has
begun to create a new cafe and improve access to the building, part
of the national arts complex on the south bank of the River Thames.</TE>
<TE>   The entire hall will close for 15 to 17 months beginning in 2005.</TE>

<TE>   Bail Denied for Indian Actor in Fatal Accident</TE>
<TE>   A Bombay magistrate on Thursday refused to release on bail Indian
movie star Salman Khan, who is facing charges of culpable homicide
for allegedly driving his car onto a Bombay sidewalk and killing one
person sleeping there.</TE>
<TE>   Three other people were hospitalized with major injuries in the
Sept. 27 accident. If convicted, Khan can be jailed for up to 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   The muscular actor, who has played tough-guy roles and romantic
leads in more than 20 blockbuster movies, was arrested several hours
after the accident and initially charged with rash and negligent
driving, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. He
was released on bail, only to be arrested again this week on the more
serious charges following criticism that the police were being too
lenient.</TE>
<TE>   Khan's attorneys have said he was not driving the car at the time
of the accident.</TE>

"Have a Holly Jolly Christmas" and "I've Got My Love to Keep Me

<HD>'Dinner' Roasts Ovitz, With 'Godfather's' Help</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A12-minute video that pokes fun at Michael Ovitz for his tell-all
Vanity Fair interview in August is making the rounds in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The filmmakers, Steve Young and Denise David, decided to make "My
Dinner With Ovitz" after reading the eyebrow-raising article in which
Ovitz blamed his demise in the industry on the so-called gay mafia.
In the article, Ovitz points a finger at some of Hollywood's most
prominent players--including DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen,
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, Vivendi Universal Entertainment's
Chairman Barry Diller and President Ron Meyer--for his colossal
failures after leaving the agency he co-founded, Creative Artists
Agency.</LD>
<LD>   Writer-director Young said he just wanted to have a little fun.
"It's a great joke," Young said Thursday. "It's Hollywood history,
and I'm a satirist; it's what I do."</LD>
<TE>   A sequence reminiscent of "The Godfather" scene with a bloody
horse's head opens the spoof, but this time it's Eisner who wakes up
and finds a bloody Mickey Mouse in his bed. The tape goes on to show
actors playing Eisner, Geffen, Diller, Meyer and screenwriter Joe
Eszterhas plotting to silence Ovitz by "whacking him." In the tape
Eisner asks incredulously, "What do you think this is--the music
business? Where you just do a drive-by?" They arrange for Geffen to
meet Ovitz at the gay bar Mother Lode. Geffen then shoots Ovitz in
the head for fear of another article being written.</TE>
<TE>   Young said the tape is not for sale but that he and David
distributed about 75 copies, including to Geffen, Eisner, Diller and
Meyer.</TE>
<TE>   Young said they did not send tapes to Ovitz or Steven Seagal, who
is portrayed as Ovitz's incompetent bodyguard, because they did not
know how to reach them.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is that we got it around to people who would get the
joke," said Young, who adapted quotes from Vanity Fair and lines from
"The Godfather" as dialogue.</TE>

<LD>"The Same Thing We Do Every Night," an exhibition playfully devoted
to the theme of "technology addiction," features seven artists who've
no doubt spent more than a few late-night hours bathed in the blue
glow of computer monitors.</LD>
<LD>   Their work, much of it rooted in the aesthetic and thematic
principles of the video game, cultivates a user-friendly atmosphere
in the Project gallery, which makes the exhibition a thoroughly
enjoyable experience</LD>
<LD>   Andy Alexander's small inkjet prints, most stashed in out-of-the
way locations throughout the room, are clean, futuristic images that
lend an element of cryptic science fiction.</LD>
<TE>   Gabriel Fowle's video piece "Revelation I," which dubs an old
"Transformers" cartoon with a passage of text from the Bible ("I am
the alpha and the omega," one towering machine growls to his
followers), is bare-bones simple but startlingly effective in both
its humor and its menace.</TE>
<TE>   Janine Cirincione and Michael Ferraro's "The Bloviator"--a
complicated installation of small screens, shelves, wires, jars,
speakers and mysterious colored liquids--evokes another sci-fi
messiah: a round-headed, slit-eyed little creature who preaches a
bizarre blend of physics, philosophy and grammar from a submerged
video screen to a small crowd of identical plastic figures.</TE>
<TE>   Yucef Merhi's "Atari Poetry" series--in which the artist has
reprogrammed old Atari game consoles to produce crudely pixilated
fragments of poetic text ("As a dog I look for the bones of my body
to bury them again in me," for example)--will surely incite the
nostalgia of old-school technophiles.</TE>
<TE>   For the more up-to-date, there's James Bruckhouse's "Tap," a very
charming program for individual personal digital assistants
(available for download on the Internet) that features the animated
figure of a tap dancer. (The piece, which was included in the 2002
Whitney Biennial, appears here on a sample personal digital
assistant, alongside two preparatory sketches.)</TE>
<TE>   Jason Salavon's "Golem" is, like "Tap," a product of programming:
a digital archive of 100,000 abstract "paintings," which the viewer
can scroll through on a computer screen and which are also projected
on a nearby wall. Though these are hardly great paintings by
traditional standards, there's something soothing about their
quantity, their availability. "Why paint when you can program
painting?" Salavon seems to be asking.</TE>
<TE>   For a moment or two, it sounds like a reasonable question.</TE>

<TE>   Intelligent Work Forges Links</TE>
<TE>   In a statement accompanying her current exhibition, Iona Rozeal
Brown poses the question: "What does it mean to be linked, connected
to someone or something and only feel it or suppose it but not know
why or how to even explain it?"</TE>
<TE>   In a shrinking world, where ethnic boundaries are fluid and
cultural identification is an ever more lucrative commodity, this is
a significant--and tellingly convoluted--question. The specific
connection that Brown refers to in her work is one she's observed:
contemporary Japanese and Korean youth forging with African American
hip-hop culture.</TE>
<TE>   Her flat, colorful paintings are rendered in the Ukiyo-e style of
Japanese imagery, a style developed in the 17th century that is
generally associated with images of everyday life and leisure. But
they also incorporate idiosyncratic fragments of hip-hop fashion.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to traditional Japanese robes, slippers and hair
combs, for example, Brown's figures wear Afros, cornrows, caps with
logos and brown skin paint. They smoke cigarettes, spin records and
gaze coolly at the viewer, as if posing for CD covers.</TE>
<TE>   Implicit in Brown's treatment of this subject is another important
connection: her own fascination, as an American, with the behavior of
these Asian youth and the aesthetic traditions of Asian culture
generally. Her adoption of the Ukiyo-e style is, after all, not so
far removed from her subject's adoption of hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   Although she must be aware of this peculiar reciprocity, she stops
short of addressing it directly. Indeed, one senses throughout the
work that Brown is far more interested in raising provocative
questions than in answering them. Her paintings aim to jar
expectations through the unexpected juxtaposition of coded icons,
which may be a useful tactic in dealing so frankly with issues of
race.</TE>
<TE>   The shortcomings of the work are largely formal and suggest that
the project has yet to reach its full maturity. (This is Brown's
first solo exhibition since graduating from the Yale School of Art
last spring.) For all her researched familiarity with the Ukiyo-e
style, Brown's use of line feels tentative and thick, her colors
uncomfortably self-conscious. One finds oneself longing for greater
delicacy and a sense of spontaneity, qualities admittedly more
difficult to acquire than research.</TE>
<TE>   Brown seems considerably more confident of her ideas than her
images. That said, this is work of great intellectual energy; her
images may just need the time to catch up.</TE>

<TE>   Proof of Talent</TE>
<TE>   Lies in the Details</TE>
<TE>   Justin Moore's first solo exhibition is a study of cataclysmic
violence on two levels: one geological (enormous and occurring over
hundreds of thousands of years), the other vehicular (small and
occurring in an instant). Working in a variety of media, he conveys
images of both--craggy rock formations on the one hand, piles of
crumpled metal on the other--on roughly the same scale, rendering
them all but indistinguishable.</TE>
<TE>   It is, on the whole, an intelligent and cohesive project. The
highlights are the works that showcase Moore's great talent for
intricate detail.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of lithographs on Formica and a digital print (available on
the gallery's Web site) depicting junkyard mounds of automotive
flesh, buckled and twisted beyond recognition, transcend the
grittiness of their subject to achieve a sense of organic unity. In
two larger works--an ink drawing and an oil painting, each of which
depicts a bird's eye view of a rocky island floating mysteriously in
a sea of white--Moore's delicate handling of detail creates a
fantastical mood that makes the works thoroughly engrossing.</TE>
<TE>   The show's two installations are somewhat less convincing.
"Tectonic" consists of half a dozen video monitors running abstracted
images of automobile accidents with an ominous soundtrack. It's a
stylish but ultimately underwhelming addition that feels largely
unnecessary alongside to the more genuinely absorbing two-dimensional
works.</TE>
<TE>   The larger installation involves a toy slot car track and a very
long acrylic painting--a jungle panorama with a car wreck at one
end--that wraps around the track on three adjacent walls. The track
is fun to play with but ultimately negligible in its conceptual
impact; the painting, which seems to have been all too quickly
assembled, is largely generic in design, amateurish in technique and
on the whole not nearly interesting enough to justify its size.</TE>
<TE>   The failings of these last two works are largely the failings of
ambition, the result, one senses, of an attempt by the artist to move
into new media. In a relatively young body of work like this, such
ambition can hardly be viewed too critically; it might prove an asset
in the end.</TE>

<TE>   Exhibition Details</TE>
<TE>   Eoff's Maturation</TE>
<TE>   In his third solo exhibition at the Patricia Faure Gallery, Jason
Eoff has clearly got his game down. The paintings assembled
here--square and rectangular fields of rich, glossy color, each
encrusted with a small cluster of jewel-like dots in a different
color of paint--are pure sensual pleasure, tuned to near perfect
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   The works are constructed on wood panels with some combination of
modeling paste, resin and oil paint, but they transcend their
individual materials.</TE>
<TE>   Each field is liquid smooth and appears, when viewed from the
front, considerably deeper than its actual quarter inch. Eoff's
clever manipulation of the modeling clay beneath the surface of the
resin--though indiscernible as such--gives the impression of swirling
movement. The result is a strangely gelatinous quality, as though the
work might quiver when touched.</TE>
<TE>   Though roughly similar in design, the works are remarkably nuanced
in color and tone. One is a hot harlot red; another a deep regal
purple; another an earthy ochre and tan swirl. The surface patterns
are considerably less pronounced than those in earlier works, which
often assumed concrete shapes like circles and starbursts. Here, they
serve merely as accents in either contrast or affinity with their
given fields: a cool turquoise on the hot red, for example, or a
substantiating mauve atop the purple.</TE>
<TE>   The show on the whole has an air of sublimation. It's difficult to
see where Eoff might take this work from here without sinking into
repetition; but, in the meantime, it's a pleasure to enjoy his
achievement.</TE>

<HD>Funny, but All 'The Rules of Attraction' Does Is Repulse</HD>
<DH>Based on a Bret Easton Ellis novel about bored collegians,
the film takes its subjects too seriously.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost everything you need to know about Roger Avary's swaggering
adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' 1987 novel "The Rules of Attraction"
happens in the movie's first 10 minutes. At an "end of the world
party" where she's had too much to drink, a college freshman named
Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon) follows a film student into a bedroom where
she expects to lose her virginity. Lauren keeps drifting in and out
of consciousness, which is why it takes her a few seconds to realize
that the guy flailing on top of her isn't the film student because
the film student is recording the scene with his digital camera.
Resigned or too drunk to care, Lauren shuts her eyes--whereupon the
stranger vomits all over her face.</LD>
<TE>   That's repulsive, but what makes it noteworthy is that in the book
the guy doesn't throw up on the girl--he uses a wastebasket. There's
something to be learned from what's been added to an adaptation,
which can be as instructive as the stuff that's been omitted. Avary
adapted the novel into a screenplay as well as directed the film, and
in addition to the regurgitation tweak, he's added a temporal kink
not in the original story. Rewinding the action so that people and
beer flow in reverse, he shows Lauren and the film student walking
backward out of the bedroom and into the party, at which point the
story picks up with another character, who announces that his "life
lacks forward momentum." It isn't the only thing in the movie that
does.</TE>
<TE>   As in the book, the film revolves around three undergraduates at
an elite New England college that sounds a lot like Bennington, the
school Ellis attended in the mid-1980s when he published his first
novel, "Less Than Zero." "The Rules of Attraction," the author's
second book, centers on a drug dealer named Sean Bateman (James Van
Der Beek), younger brother to Patrick Bateman, the eponymous serial
killer from yet another of Ellis' titles, "American Psycho." Everyone
on campus seems to have a thing for Sean, including Paul (Ian
Somerhalder), a senior who once went out with Lauren, who, in turn,
soon finds herself attracted to and repulsed by the big pusher on
campus.</TE>
<TE>   Both the novel and film of "The Rules of Attraction" are stitched
together from competing interior monologues steeped in narcissism and
the sort of self-conscious anomie on which a thousand and one teen
stories have burned bright. The book is set during the mid-1980s, a
fertile period for Ellis' brand-name lampooning. For him, college is
a hunting ground in which no one ever goes to class, cracks open a
book (much less a smile) or gives serious thought to the future,
including such then-hot causes as ending apartheid. When they're not
imbibing dope, partaking in sexual musical chairs or feeling
oppressed by their parents' money, the characters are riffling
through high and low culture like bored teenagers flipping through
bins of used CDs.</TE>
<TE>   To underscore the sheer meaningless of, like, you know, life,
every so often someone mentions the "postmodern condition," which
Ellis seems to think is another word for alienation. It's this sense
of juvenile despair that likely appealed to Avary, who, because he
takes the characters and their discount ennui as gospel, manages to
turn a parody of adolescent angst into a pricey exploitation movie.
The principal problem for Avary is that in contrast to Ellis, a
writer whose slippery point of view tends to send up the characters
he enshrines (intentionally or not), the director doesn't have the
gift of speaking out of both sides of his mouth at the same time.
However many crude jokes he cracks, Avary takes these kids seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Priming the pump of adult outrage comes with being young, as does
showing off. When one of the characters in the film slits her wrists,
the suicide is as flamboyantly staged (and lovingly shot) as a Vegas
floor show. Avary, whose other feature is the shock caper film
"Killing Zoe" (1994) and who remains best known for co-writing "Pulp
Fiction" with Quentin Tarantino, isn't one to indulge in empathy,
particularly if gets in the way of a cool setup. His film is crammed
with such showboating technique. The camera prowls and zips for some
Brian De Palma loop-de-loop by way of David Fincher. In one scene,
the screen splits into two halves that are subsequently fused
together; in another, a fantasy takes up one side of the image while
reality weighs down the other.</TE>
<TE>   Set in an ambiguous time period that looks like the present but is
rife with 1980s touchstones (pop music mostly), Avary's film exists
in a vacuum. It's as hermetically sealed as a Hollywood backlot or
one of those dystopian Shangri-Las from the movies; the off-campus
world exists solely in the local dealer's shack or as a ribald
restaurant scene with Paul's mother (Faye Dunaway). The exception is
a cleverly accelerated interlude in which a character named Vincent
(Kip Pardue) narrates his recent whirlwind tour of Europe with the
animation and run-on sentences of a speed freak. The sequence is
funny and a relief--a welcome escape from the campus sturm und drang.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't just that there's no place for the outside world in the
film--no one is glued to CNN or even MTV News--it's that there's no
place for meaning. Bubble boys and girls trapped inside their own
self-consciousness, Avary's characters drift from dorm to dorm, party
to party. The boys are cool, the girls are hot and none of them are
interested or interesting. However little Ellis' characters studied,
at least the author's vanity meant his undergraduates knew the names
of the books they weren't reading. Avary entertains no such worries.
One dorm wall flaunts a Robbie Conal poster, but the film's cultural
references are primarily confined to music and movies, including a
wincing reference to Tarantino.</TE>
<TE>   That reference is as mystifying as it is embarrassing, and also
comes in the film's first 10 minutes. As with the early reversed
footage, all the Tarantino mention does is make you think that Avary
somehow means to go backward in time, and, in some respects, that's
what he does. There's a Blondie song on the soundtrack, even an
allusion to Tom Cruise's BVD dance in "Risky Business." The actress
who plays Lauren recalls Winona Ryder, while the actor who plays Paul
resembles Rob Lowe, two more blasts from the teen-movie past. Like
Van Der Beek's noisily hyped role as a bad boy, though, none of it
adds up to anything. Cinematic pyrotechnics aside, the only thing
Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude. It makes
sense that he went back to school to check out the girls--his film is
a frat boy's idea of a good time.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong sexual content, drug use, language and
violent images. Times guidelines: adult language and themes; plus a
graphic razor-blade suicide, some casual violence and a lot of
emotion-free sex.</TE>

<HD>Intense Incursions on a Fragile Domestic Truce</HD>
<DH>'James and the Handless Maiden' probes a marriage that's
tottering along on thin ice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Brandes; Daryl H. Miller</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Are people better off knowing things they can't do anything
about--especially in relation to their spouse's loyalty? That dilemma
takes on unexpected urgency for a contemporary couple in Max Mayer's
"James and the Handless Maiden" at the Gascon Center Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Intense, committed performances drive this inaugural production by
the promising LA Stage &amp; Film theater company, although some
scripting lapses remain intractable.</LD>
<LD>   In the title role of James, a restaurateur on the financial and
marital ropes, Kevin Kilner sports a convincing breezy charm that
accounts for the popularity he enjoys despite his extreme
selfishness. Initially reflecting on whether it's better to fess up
to a past infidelity or keep it forever secret, James frames the
issue entirely in terms of convenience. He clearly has no regard for
either honoring or sparing the feelings of his actress wife, Sarah
(Catherine Corpeny). Sarah, in turn, admits to doing one thing very
well in life--pretending.</LD>
<TE>   Abruptly intruding on their paper-thin domestic truce is Sarah's
sister, Troy (Mary McDonnell), newly discharged from a mental
institution where she's been confined for stabbing her husband.
Brittle, caustic and equipped with an unerring instinct for
manipulation, McDonnell's chillingly vengeful Troy soon precipitates
a pivotal crisis for James and the metaphorically handless Sarah (the
reference is to a morbid fairy tale from the sisters' childhood).</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the cross-fire is James' lifelong best friend, Stanley
(David Starzyk), who harbors a secret attraction to Sarah and a past
connection to Troy as well.</TE>
<TE>   Framed by handsome production values, Randle Mell's staging is
well paced and pulls no punches in the confrontational scenes. The
glaring problem, however, is the general unpleasantness of these
characters. With personality traits ranging from self-deluded to
self-absorbed to self-destructive, there is little reason to root for
anyone onstage. Sarah, tentatively attempting to rebuild trust, asks
James, "Do we go on rescuing and terrorizing each other forever?" But
the real question is: Do we care?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, unfortunately: Not enough.</TE>

<TE>   A Lennon</TE>
<TE>   for the Faithful</TE>
<TE>   For millions of fans, the world ended with John Lennon's death in
Manhattan on Dec. 8, 1980. They get another chance to pay homage in
"One Night Only" at the Stella Adler Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director Stephen A. Roberts' intriguing conceit imagines
Lennon (Tim Piper) performing a private concert for an invited
audience. The opening finds roadies doing last-minute technical
checks on Christian Struzan's backstage setting.</TE>
<TE>   A scrim drops, the turntable revolves and "Dr. Winston O. Boogie"
appears, launching an explosive rendition of "Revolution." The
proceedings take Lennon through numbers charting his long and winding
road to this evening. This rambling commentary battles thunderstorms,
psychedelic projections and surreal voice-overs, courtesy of Tim
Stratton's lighting and Lee Harry's sound and multimedia designs.</TE>
<TE>   Piper's vocal and visual representation of Lennon is amazing. He
totally rocks out, assisted by Don Butler on lead guitar, Greg Piper
on bass and Jim Marsala on drums.</TE>
<TE>   However, though catnip for acolytes, "One Night Only" does not
excavate much new insight beneath its keenly designed surface. The
reliance upon familiarity with Lennoniana to supply nuances may
frustrate less worshipful observers, and the use of Samuel Barber's
"Adagio for Strings" as accompaniment to the newsreel epilogue is not
exactly fresh.</TE>
<TE>   The amplification levels, though undoubtedly authentic, are
unacceptable in so compact a venue, masking the lyrics and therefore
blurring content. This will be immaterial to the faithful, but
attendees with delicate eardrums should take precautions.</TE>

<TE>   'Hollywood' Afire</TE>
<TE>   With Titillation</TE>
<TE>   Like the underground films to which it pays homage, Michael
Sargent's "Hollywood Burning" is determined to shake things up.
Taking stylistic cues from the likes of Kenneth Anger, Jack Smith and
Andy Warhol, it is defiant, bewildering and titillating.</TE>
<TE>   A skeptic might say, however, that those filmmakers merely used
art as a cloak to see what they could get away with, and the same
could be claimed of Sargent's play in its premiere at the Evidence
Room, where it leads off a repertory cycle devoted to Los Angeles
writers (Justin Tanner and Peter J. Nieves are also featured) and
their thoughts about Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Sargent's story unfolds in the satanic chapel-sadomasochistic
torture chamber of a Hollywood Hills home that is outfitted, in Jason
Adams and Erik Hanson's wry design, with a sarcophagus and
scary-looking medieval weapons.</TE>
<TE>   This is the residence and filmmaking studio of Kenneth Angry (Tom
Fitzpatrick). With mop-top hair dyed jet black and eyes rimmed with
dark eyeliner, he cultivates an avant-garde image, opening those
raccoon eyes as wide as they'll go while delivering such arch
statements as "I hate Hollywood, and it hates me back. It's a perfect
relationship."</TE>
<TE>   That sort of off-kilter humor drives the first half of the story,
as Angry's former superstars L.A. Joe (Charlie Santore, playing a Joe
Dallesandro type) and Nita (Liz Davies, as an Edie Sedgwick type)
return to make one more film. Co-starring as their humiliation victim
will be Angry's current protege, the brainless pretty boy Puck
(Jamison Haase).</TE>
<TE>   Much of this is familiar territory for Sargent. Film has been his
topic in such plays as "I Hate!" and "Tarantula," with their twisted
takes on classic-movie motifs, as well as in "Sweet Hostage" and
"Steeltown," about the porn industry.</TE>
<TE>   The yuks turn to yucks, however, as Angry's filmic allegory
quickly devolves into a pretext for stripping the performers and
having them engage in sex, blocked from audience view yet leaving
little to the imagination.</TE>
<TE>   The actors gamely debase themselves, and Sargent, serving as his
own director, stylishly stages the action to a throbbing soundtrack.
But surely there's more humor--not to mention insight--to be drawn
from underground filmmaking than Sargent delivers in this XXX-rated
assault.</TE>

<HD>After 19 Years at the Wave, Program Director Is Departing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Brodie, the only program director the Wave, KTWV-FM (94.7), has
ever had, is leaving the smooth-jazz outlet at the end of the year.</LD>
<LD>   "Going on 19 years, I think I've been intimately involved with
raising a very healthy station," Brodie said Thursday. But now she
wants to spend more time with her 10-year-old daughter, Leah.</LD>
<LD>   Brodie has been at the station since 1984, when it was still
KMET--"the Mighty Met," where album-oriented rock was said to have
been invented.</LD>
<TE>   Saying she "made probably the ultimate transformation," Brodie
helped shepherd the format change from rock to smooth jazz in 1987,
with KTWV becoming a pioneer in exclusively featuring such artists as
Sade, Anita Baker and Kenny G.</TE>
<TE>   "At best, it was exhilarating. At worst, it was very difficult--we
were under a microscope," she said. "The eyes of the industry were on
it. The world kind of looked on us as a wacky experiment."</TE>
<TE>   The station worked through growing pains, such as realizing a
DJ-free format didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   "The major highlight was really watching in the mid-'90s, when the
station reached its own," she said, and ratings and advertising
revenue surged.</TE>
<TE>   She said she foresees the station continuing efforts to increase
its exposure, publicizing itself to new fans. She'll spend the last
months of her unusually long tenure working with her bosses to find a
replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm taking the time to stretch out a little bit and explore some
other opportunities," Brodie said, and also to see what it's like
just to be a consumer of music and radio. "I think it's going to be
good for my perspective on a lot of things."</TE>

<LD>If you could convert neuroses and insecurity into gasoline, then
Jerry Seinfeld could provide us with an alternate national fuel
reserve. What makes "Comedian" more than just another documentary
about the comedy club comeback of a sitcom prince is that it
contrasts his struggle with that of just another stand-up climber,
Orny Adams. Where Seinfeld is high-test, Adams is no-lead and
no-clue: arrogant, image-conscious and bereft of humility.</LD>
<LD>   The differences in the two comics' priorities could fill volumes.
While Seinfeld (who is also producer) could be short-shrifting Adams'
performance moments, one doubts it. One need only compare the young
pup's wired bravado with the relaxed sheen of Bill Cosby, Garry
Shandling, Jay Leno and Robert Klein, among the many veterans who
blow in and out here.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, success can be confidence-building. The film's most
revealing moments, however, show superstar Seinfeld in full flub mode
and high pre-show anxiety. Hopefully, Adams is taking notes, or he'll
need to be content with these 15 minutes of piggyback fame.</LD>

<HD>Hunt Lieberson's Voice Can Fill the Void</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lorraine Hunt Lieberson wasn't particularly successful in filling
Royce Hall; the audience was small for her recital Wednesday night.
But this mezzo-soprano also happened to fill Royce Hall more
impressively than any vocalist I have ever heard in the UCLA
auditorium. Even in an age of dazzling mezzos lurking around
practically every corner, her combination of imposing dramatic
intensity and overwhelming vocal presence astonishes.</LD>
<LD>   It is hard to fit Hunt Lieberson into categories. She has starred
in stunning recordings of Handel operas and oratorios. In her
vehement staged performances of Bach cantatas, she has invested the
unflinching essence of life and death. She's ideal for Berlioz as
well; her just-announced appearance in Metropolitan Opera's new
production of "The Trojans" early next year is eagerly awaited.</LD>
<LD>   Married to an excellent composer, Peter Lieberson, Hunt Lieberson
also is devoted to music of our time. She returns to Los Angeles
later in the season for John Adams' "El Nino" with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, which has commissioned a song cycle for her from her
husband for 2005.</LD>
<TE>   What is perhaps most unusual about Hunt Lieberson, though, is that
while she embodies the versatility and vivid theatricality of the
ideal modern singer, she also maintains the traditional virtues of
singers of bygone eras. Who else today throws herself into every
utterance with such abandon?</TE>
<TE>   Anything Hunt Lieberson sings, anything at all, is sure to be
riveting, and that was the case at Royce. After a sustained illness a
couple of years ago, she has made a comeback, sounding stronger and
fresher than ever. And her ideas about programming haven't become any
more conventional.</TE>
<TE>   Two Handel opera arias, "Scherza infida" from "Ariodante" and the
famous "Lascia ch'io pianga" from "Rinaldo," immediately set the tone
of high seriousness and acute emotion. With no ado, no warming up or
settling in, she wrenched listeners out of their world and into
Ariodante's tormented, suicidal psyche with the very first note she
sang, and there was no letup for the rest of the evening. The aria
from "Rinaldo," beloved of singers of old for its weepy beauty,
filled the hall with the massive old-fashioned robust lusciousness of
her voice, but her sensitivity to the modern ideas about the Baroque
style also made it sound newly minted.</TE>
<TE>   Five French songs by five different composers from the late 19th
century and early 20th century followed. Debussy, Ravel, Chausson,
Faure and Emile Paladilhe were each a distinct musical personality
but shared the same devotion to poetic language. And Hunt Lieberson
made each word speak, with the exception of Ravel's "Vocalise en
Forme de Habanera," which has no text and in which she lost herself
in sensual abandon.</TE>
<TE>   After intermission came two songs by the American composer Ricky
Ian Gordon to sad poems about cherishing life under death's shadow by
Jane Kenyon. Unlike the French, Gordon is a composer who stays out of
poetry's way, not so much giving words a voice as a cushion for them
to sit on and air around them to let them resonate. Here restrained,
Hunt Lieberson, whose own bout with cancer must have made the words
personal, let them tell their own story. But she then turned to
hot-blooded Spanish music by two Jaoquins, Turina and Rodrigo, and
poured out the passion in huge lyric streams, reminding us that she
could be a Carmen for the ages if she ever gets around to singing the
role.</TE>
<TE>   The last set was a cycle of five recent songs by Lieberson to
German poems by Rainer Maria Rilke. Once a composer of rigorous
atonal music, Lieberson has become more of a colorist and fantasist
in recent years, creating engaging, brilliant scores often
illustrative of wondrous Tibetan Buddhist legends. The expressionist
Rilke songs are something of a throwback, earnest explorations of the
darker corners of the soul. But here Lieberson's music doesn't stay
depressingly black; light finds a way to shoot through in the piano
accompaniment, as does Lieberson's inherent sense of wonder. The
mezzo, for her part, seemed to live each of Rilke's diffusive lines.</TE>
<TE>   A short recital, it also was an exhausting one that had two short
encores--a surprising early song from Copland, "Pastorale," and a
serenely potent performance of "Deep River." Robert Tweten was the
astute, assured pianist. He played as accompanists mostly do, with
the piano lid down. I would have liked to have had it up. I think
Hunt Lieberson could handle it as she seems to be able to handle
everything else.</TE>

<HD>Help! Couple Overboard</HD>
<DH>Madonna and husband Guy Ritchie's outdated update of 'Swept
Away' is even less plausible than the original.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't blame her--well, at least, not too much.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, it was Madonna who agreed to star in her writer-director
husband's remake of Lina Wertmuller's grimly unfunny "Swept Away ...
by an unusual destiny in the blue sea of August." Apparently she and
Guy Ritchie didn't know that the 1975 Italian film about a wealthy
woman and an indigent fisherman stranded on a deserted Mediterranean
island was dated the minute it hit. A remake about two people who
claw at each other before falling into the surf like Burt Lancaster
and Deborah Kerr didn't just seem untenable; it seemed pointless. It
wasn't simply that the original's chatter about capitalists and
communists was so 1968. It's that the image of a woman melting into
the arms of her attacker was antediluvian--the rape of the Sabine
women played for laughs.</LD>
<TE>   Ritchie's version closely follows the arc of Wertmuller's story
with only a handful of changes and what sounds like less dialogue.
The first iteration begins at sea, with the characters already in
gear, while the new "Swept Away" (the cutesy subtitle has been
dropped) starts with an American retinue of the rich and pampered
cutting a swath through an Italian pier on its way to a yacht. Set
for a cruise to the Greek islands are Madonna's character, Amber; her
pharmaceutical magnate husband (Bruce Greenwood); two other men
(David Thornton and Michael Beattie) and their female accessories,
the ship's resident bimbo (Elizabeth Banks) and a cartoon dipsomaniac
(Jeanne Tripplehorn) who appears patterned on Patsy from "Absolutely
Fabulous."</TE>
<TE>   A diva with a frosted leonine mane, her eyes obscured by
windshield-sized sunglasses, Amber enters complaining, stopping only
long enough to take hits off her cigarillos. Some of her criticisms
read silly, the mewling of a spoiled child (the ship doesn't have a
gym); some are perfectly reasonable (she doesn't like reheated
coffee), although these are minor infractions compared to the way she
treats the help. She's rude to the captain and insulting to the first
mate, Giuseppe (Adriano Giannini, whose father, Giancarlo, had the
same role in 1975), whom she alternately calls Guido and Pee-Pee. Her
philosophy of life, or at least her excuse for living, is summed up
by a speech about capitalism that she delivers while furiously
pedaling an exercise bike; in essence, those who control the goods,
the situation and the power have the right to do what they want.</TE>
<TE>   This diluted political analysis doesn't have the sting of
Wertmuller's exchanges, which, however reductive, at least had the
benefit of topicality. Set in a climate of intense partisan strife
and terrorist violence, the first "Swept Away" used class
struggle--the fisherman is a Sicilian communist, the woman a blond
Northerner--to obscure deeply unpleasant ideas about men, women and
our true natures. At the core of the story is the near infantile
dependence the rich have on their employees, a reliance that takes an
ironic twist after its Adam and Eve land on the island and the woman
discovers she can't fend for herself. Soon after they're cast ashore,
the fisherman forces the woman (who had taken to licking wet rocks
for water) into wholesale servitude, insisting that she call him
master.</TE>
<TE>   For Wertmuller, we're all opportunists no matter what color our
flag. Her cynicism is dispiriting but it's also calculating because
her jive about class is purely a means to score points about men and
women. In the end, all the rich woman needs to find happiness,
perhaps even love, is a few well-placed punches and kicks, along with
the threat of sexual assault. This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act
didn't play well then and it plays worse now. It's bad enough that
the director of the noisome gangster films "Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch" likes women even less than his
predecessor; unlike Wertmuller, he proves incapable of sustaining a
scene or a mood, much less a moment of quiet.</TE>
<TE>   It's puzzling what attracted Madonna to "Swept Away," unless she
thought that the film could help soften her metal-plate persona.
She's had a famously difficult time finding roles that can fit with
her outsize personality, and perhaps the idea of getting publicly
smacked around seemed like a good way to curry favor with audiences
that no longer hang on her every costume change.</TE>
<TE>   In surer, kinder hands, the strategy might have worked. What she
couldn't have counted on is that the streak of sadism evidenced in
Ritchie's previous features would work so cruelly against her,
beginning with her character's diminished wit and savvy, and
continuing through the unflattering way in which she is often
photographed.</TE>
<TE>   More than a harsh taskmaster, Amber is an aggressive, almost
masculine creation, from the cut of her bespoke pants to the cut of
her muscles. It seems no coincidence that the character comes across
as an uglier version of the pop goddess, a kind of fantasy of what we
all think we know about the star. It is, to put it mildly, a
bewildering strategy. Madonna may be better in this film than she's
been in some of her recent endeavors, especially when she stops
screeching her lines, but she's done herself no favors with her
choice of material. In Wertmuller's version the once-imperious woman
notoriously begs the fisherman to sodomize her, a request that's
meant to symbolize her submission as well as her degradation. That
exchange doesn't happen here but it doesn't matter--the woman is
debased from the start.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and some sexuality/nudity. Times
guidelines: adult language throughout, plus one scene of lovemaking
and some discreet nudity.</TE>

<LD>It's been over a month since "The Caroline Rhea Show" took to the
airwaves, the hand-picked successor to the daytime-talk franchise
carved out by Rosie O'Donnell. But in these few weeks, the show's
prospects for success have only become murkier.</LD>
<LD>   It's not so much what has happened in front of the cameras. Rhea,
a talented actress and stand-up comic who is perhaps best known as
co-star of the TV series "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch," has pretty
much delivered what was expected. Monologue, celebrity interviews,
comedy bits, musical guest--it's a heavily formatted package with a
stridently upbeat veneer, presided over by Rhea's sunny wit and, when
that lapses, sheer energy. And the guest list has been impressive
(Goldie Hawn, Ron Howard, Julie Andrews, the TV debut of the new
Pretenders).</LD>
<LD>   But a grab-bag of other featured bits--guessing which secret goes
with which guest, using a stack of stock question cards a la the
Bravo channel's James Lipton, and audience participation gags have
been wobbly.</LD>
<TE>   Even the show's opening segment is being retooled, and there's
reportedly a lot of nail-biting going on behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   The wildly varying time slots for the syndicated program haven't
helped. O'Donnell's show held down a plum 3 p.m. spot, but despite
Rhea's similarly strong afternoon vibe, she airs weeknights at 11 in
Los Angeles on KCAL-TV Channel 9. And even in the show's home base of
New York, it's on after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell alluded to the problems during a visit to "Caroline"
this week. "You're doing a great job," she told Rhea, "and I think
the only person in this room who doesn't believe it is you."</TE>
<TE>   Rhea looked as if she wanted to crawl under her desk, but
O'Donnell knows what it takes to survive in these waters. We'll see
if Rhea has what it takes to stay afloat.</TE>

<HD>Isn't It Daringly, Absurdly Romantic?</HD>
<DH>'Punch-Drunk Love' mines real emotion on the extreme edges
of the genre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Love is strange," the old rock lyric insists, and it's never been
stranger, more unsettling and more exuberantly unexpected than in the
daring high-wire act Paul Thomas Anderson shrewdly calls "Punch-Drunk
Love."</LD>
<LD>   Anderson, the gifted writer-director known for such intense and
creative films as "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia," is not the person
you'd expect to be turning out a 97-minute made-for-each-other
romantic comedy, but a desire to challenge himself is what led him
here, and something completely different is the postmodern result.</LD>
<LD>   What Anderson and his equally unlikely stars, Adam Sandler and
Emily Watson, have managed is to stretch the boundaries of the
romantic comedy genre to their extreme outer limits. Charming and
outlandish by turns, this misfit love story of disconnected people
trying to find one another in an antagonistic world is a comedy of
discomfort and rage that turns unexpectedly sweet and pure. The
notion of falling in love has always had an element of the
dangerously absurd about it, but never more so than here.</LD>
<TE>   Only a filmmaker of exemplary skills could make something
memorable out of such contradictory material--and win the best
director award at Cannes in the bargain. You can feel Anderson's
singular vision, his intense pleasure in creating cinema, in
everything from Jon Brion's percussive soundtrack and Robert Elswit's
color-saturated cinematography to Jeremy Blake's gorgeous digitally
generated plasma screen art to create mood. You can even feel it in
"Punch-Drunk Love's" still moments, when nothing appears to be
happening but something definitely is.</TE>
<TE>   One of the remarkable things about "Punch-Drunk Love" turns out to
be how cagey it is, how determined to hold back from letting on
exactly what is going on. This is a film in which both the audience
and the characters need to allocate some time to taking a deep breath
and getting their bearings.</TE>
<TE>   As much as it is a romance, "Punch-Drunk Love" is a character
study illuminated by the two actors Anderson wrote the film for,
especially Sandler as Barry Egan: Valley resident, small-business man
(his company manufactures novelty bathroom plungers) and awkward lost
soul whose mantra might be "this is making me very uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   A man without a life who wears a suit to work as if to convince
himself he really is in business, Barry has been terminally
browbeaten by seven thoughtlessly aggressive sisters who break his
confidences and savagely tease him without a moment's remorse.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Barry periodically goes berserk from the stress
of it all. He has a tendency to cry for no reason, to physically
attack glass doors and tear apart innocent bathrooms, to unwisely
confess to a brother-in-law, "I don't like myself sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   He is, not to put too fine a point on it, not just some
misunderstood nice guy but also a man who is truly disturbed. There
is probably no one but Sandler who could so convincingly play Barry's
combination of genuine innocence with ramped-up hostility. In Watson
he finds a co-star whose presence is so luminous that Sandler said at
Cannes that she was the first co-star his girlfriend didn't mind
watching him get romantic with. "Punch-Drunk Love" opens very early
on a very quiet morning, the kind when anything can happen, when a
Checker Cab, for instance, can pull up in front of Barry's place of
business and unceremoniously deposit a harmonium on the street. Or
when an attractive woman named Lena Leonard (Watson) can drop her car
off early at the garage next door and ask Barry if he'd mind keeping
an eye on it. (He wouldn't.)</TE>
<TE>   Barry can't focus too much on any of this because he is
preoccupied with an epochal discovery he's made: The Healthy Choice
company has made a marketing mistake in a promotions, a mistake that
will enable him to buy more than a million frequent flier miles for
the price of some cups of pudding. A great many cups of pudding,
actually, but still pudding. Barry is too timid to actually travel,
but this is the opportunity of a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, still checking on the fine print about the
pudding in his anonymous Sherman Oaks apartment, Barry stumbles on a
"Are you ready for an intimate affair?" ad for phone sex. He dials
the number, partly on a whim, partly just for human contact and
possibly not with sex on his mind at all.</TE>
<TE>   But his involvement with the mysterious world of Georgia (Ashley
Clark) and Dean (Philip Seymour Hoffman) causes a blowback that adds
major complications to his life.</TE>
<TE>   Unlikely as it is, "Punch-Drunk Love" was initially inspired by
reality (the pudding ploy, figured out by a UC Davis professor,
actually happened) and returned the favor by using real locations and
many nonactors. When you hear Shelly Duvall sing Harry Nilsson's "He
Needs Me" from the "Popeye" soundtrack at key moments in the film,
you'll know the emotion in "Punch-Drunk Love" is for real as well.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong language, including a scene of sexual
dialogue. Times guidelines: a realistic phone sex sequence.</TE>

<HD>Artful 'Oleander' Needs More Compelling Voice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A double sense of loss runs through the film version of Janet Fitch's
bestselling novel, "White Oleander," a feeling of absence that is
partly appropriate and partly not.</LD>
<LD>   What's intended is the loss felt by young Astrid Magnussen,
suddenly thrust into the maelstrom of a series of disturbing foster
homes when her controlling, uncompromising, breathtakingly dangerous
mother, Ingrid, is imprisoned for murdering her lover.</LD>
<LD>   The thrust of both Fitch's impressive novel and the artful Peter
Kosminsky film that's been carefully made from it is the complex and
difficult route Astrid must take to become her own person, to
separate from a toxic parent who is even more frightening because she
loves her daughter very much.</LD>
<TE>   But to watch the film version (which stars Michelle Pfeiffer as
Ingrid, newcomer Alison Lohman as Astrid, and Robin Wright Penn and
Renee Zellweger as two of her foster mothers) is to feel, even if one
hasn't read the novel, an unwanted sense of loss, a sense that this
film, possibly inevitably, has not gotten all there is to get from
Fitch's work.</TE>
<TE>   This despite the fact that "White Oleander" has done many things
right in its adaptation, starting with the casting of Pfeiffer, who
gives a riveting, impeccable performance in what is literally and
figuratively a killer role. "When I heard Michelle do Ingrid," author
Fitch has said, "it raised the hair on my arms."</TE>
<TE>   Fitch also signed off on Mary Agnes Donoghue's screenplay and its
inevitable telescoping of events: The number of foster homes has been
cut down, and Astrid's age range changed, from 12 to 19, to 15 to 18.
There is also an inevitable softening of incident from a screenwriter
whose best-known credit is "Beaches." Gone are some of Astrid's
rougher sexual experiences, gone is a dog attack that physically
scars her, and scenes with a boyfriend ("Almost Famous' " Patrick
Fugit) have been beefed up and sweetened.</TE>
<TE>   But even as one admires "White Oleander's" avoidance of the
crasser side of melodrama, the equally powerful sense that something
critical is missing refuses to go away. This is a film without a
center, a film whose young protagonist should have more texture, more
of a compelling voice than she does. Through no real fault of the
acting, young Astrid does not compel our attention the way she must
if "White Oleander" is to succeed completely on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   The novel's great strength is that it is told in Astrid's voice.
She may be only a teenager, but she has a vivid and wonderful way
with language, a sensibility alive with thoughts like "I felt my
guilt like a brand" and "A tone I'd never heard crept into her voice,
serrated, like the edge of a saw." Except for the occasional
voice-over, it's in the nature of the filmmaking process that this
compelling voice disappears, leaving us with the usual inarticulate
teenager, a character who almost by definition can't carry her
intended weight. Kosminsky (whose background is mostly in British TV)
has said in interviews that he cast the chameleon-like Lohman because
he wanted someone "who was hard to read." Given the obstacles this
kind of role presents, opaqueness doesn't seem like the best
qualification.</TE>
<TE>   Lohman does best when her character is challenged, and that
responsibility is almost exclusively filled by the incandescent
Pfeiffer, who brings power and unshakable will to her role as
mother-master manipulator.</TE>
<TE>   Changed from the book's poet to the more visual occupation of
artist, Pfeiffer's Ingrid is a genuinely threatening individual,
given to comments like "Love humiliates you, hatred cradles you" and
determined, even from prison, to leave her controlling mark on all of
Astrid's foster situations. "Stay away from broken people" is her
motto, and in Ingrid's eyes, that means everyone but her.</TE>
<TE>   Astrid's first foster home is with Starr, a born-again former
stripper and recovering alcoholic who lives in Tujunga with her
boyfriend, Ray (a cool Cole Hauser), and wants to know if Astrid has
accepted Jesus as her savior. This character may sound like a cliche,
but as played, very much against type, by Wright Penn in an excellent
performance, she is completely individual and holds Astrid and our
attentions almost as much as Ingrid does.</TE>
<TE>   Claire Richards (Zellweger), Astrid's next placement, is quite
different, an insecure actress who lives in Malibu with a husband
(Noah Wyle) who's always on location. She's looking for a sister and
a companion more than a child, and there's a bit of awkwardness about
Zellweger's performance that sometimes serves this conception,
sometimes not. By the time we get to the final foster mom, the
capitalist-in-training Rena (Svetlana Efremova), Astrid's
inscrutability has worn on us, and we care as little as she seems to
about where she ends up.</TE>
<TE>   But even though "White Oleander" (named for a plant that is both
poisonous and beautiful) is not always compelling, it's a tribute to
the strength of the book's conception and the good work that's gone
into it that it retains the power to haunt us. This may be an
incomplete film, but it's also one that gives us reasons to watch.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for mature thematic elements concerning
dysfunctional relationships, drug content, language, sexuality and
violence. Times guidelines: Disturbing in myriad ways, much more than
its rating would have you believe.</TE>

<LD>The Power of Place</LD>
<LD>   What is your neighborhood like? How are your neighbors different
from you? What do you share in common?</LD>
<LD>   Located just east of downtown and the L.A. River is Boyle Heights,
a special Los Angeles neighborhood. Boyle Heights has been home to
people from different places who have different beliefs and who speak
different languages.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1930s, people of Jewish, Japanese, Italian, Russian and
Armenian backgrounds as well as many African-Americans lived in Boyle
Heights. More than 70 years later, it is still home to people from
many different cultures, cities, states and countries. Like many
neighborhoods, it is always changing.</TE>
<TE>   Most of us have places in our neighborhoods that we visit time and
again. In the 1940s, Boyle Heights residents could be seen in
Hollenbeck Park or at the buzzing corner of Brooklyn and Soto. Today,
Avenida Cesar Chavez, a street that runs through the neighborhood,
has many businesses, organizations and places of worship where people
come together.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about the special neighborhood of Boyle Heights
in the exhibition "Boyle Heights: The Power of Place" at the Japanese
American National Museum through Feb. 23. After seeing the
photographs, objects, artwork and images that tell the history of
Boyle Heights, go home and explore your own neighborhood. Find out
about its history. Talk to your family and friends and record what
they say. Take photographs of your favorite landmarks. Draw pictures
of your community. Put it all together and make a scrapbook about
your neighborhood. Be sure to share your discoveries with others! For
more information about the museum and its exhibition, call (213)
625-0414 or visit www.janm.org.</TE>

<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I noticed at the recent Emmy Awards that many
men wore four-in-hand ties instead of the usual black bow tie. Is
this a new trend and, if so, what color tie is best with a black
tuxedo and white shirt?</LD>
<LD>   --SURVEYING THE SCENE</LD>
<LD>   Dear Surveying: There is indeed a trend going on, Mr. Up on
Things! For the past few years more and more male celebs have opted
out of the traditional tuxedo and instead are donning dark suits with
white shirts and neckties. A major indicator that things were
changing was when Steve Martin hosted the awards in 2001 in a suit.
While there were still some tux holdouts at the recent Emmys, actors
Michael Chiklis, Kelsey Grammer, Ray Romano, Kiefer Sutherland, Tom
Hanks, Bernie Mac, Peter Krause and Richard Schiff all went tux-less.
If three's a trend, as the saying goes, this constitutes a major
sartorial shift.</LD>
<TE>   If you're wondering why, ask a man--any man--how he feels about
wearing a tuxedo and he'll probably mimic self-strangulation or say,
"I wouldn't be caught dead in that penguin costume." In other words,
most men loathe tuxedos and given a choice between that and a suit
they'll pick the latter every time.</TE>
<TE>   We have a couple of theories about why this award show trend
started. One is that our culture has experienced a major movement
toward casual dressing in the last decade or so, helped along by
stars who donned T-shirts with their Armani suits. But that doesn't
track with the fact that women at these events often dress to the
nines--or even the tens--to take that publicity-grabbing stroll down
the red carpet. That leads us to theory No. 2: Since so much
attention is heaped upon the gals and their gowns, the guys probably
figure that no one really cares if they wear a tuxedo or not. They
could probably show up in Bermuda shorts and a Hawaiian shirt and few
would bat an eye. Let's face it--men's formalwear isn't all that
exciting. As long as the men are clean and presentable the public is
happy.</TE>
<TE>   As to your question about what color tie is best with a black
tuxedo and white shirt, a black bow tie is best. In fact, men
shouldn't even think about adulterating a tuxedo by substituting a
four-in-hand tie. It's a fashion faux pas to wear a regular tie with
a tux. It's like wearing sneakers with a ball gown. With a tux a man
has to go the whole nine yards, no exceptions at all. Not even a
celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   From the Fashion Police blotter: All good things must come to an
end, according to the hackneyed phrase, and this column is no
exception.</TE>
<TE>   This is our final Fashion Police column, and if you'll allow us to
slip into the first person, I'd like to thank everyone who has
contributed over the years because without you there would have been
no column.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't know what to expect four years ago when I started Fashion
Police at the suggestion of my editor. What burning clothing issues
were on the minds of men, women and children? What perplexing fashion
problems stymied even the most stylish fashion plates? Little did I
know that many women pine for breast pockets in their jackets, that
people are sick of seeing their co-workers dress like slobs on casual
Fridays and that no one has any idea what to wear to a wedding.</TE>
<TE>   You haven't always agreed with me, but even your most vitriolic
letters and e-mails were welcomed, because getting your
feedback--good, bad or ugly--became my raison d'etre (please forgive
the pretentious use of French).</TE>
<TE>   At the very least I hope my advice has helped you get dressed
without too much Sturm und Drang (please forgive the pretentious use
of German) and that once dressed you feel a bit more confident. And
never forget the most important thing of all: They're only clothes.</TE>

<LD>Traipsing across a strip of asphalt disguised as a garden
terrace--fresh sod studded with ochre-colored flagstones--hundreds of
art lovers entered Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport for the
benefit opening of the Los Angeles Art Show.</LD>
<LD>   Diane Keaton, Billy Dee Williams and Vin Scully were a few of the
600 guests who sipped fine wines and sampled appetizers as they
cruised exhibits that ranged from spare black-and-white sketches by
Henri Matisse to generous Technicolor canvases by David Hockney. One
eye-catcher at the recent event: an art installation by Evan Sugarman
in which a microphone caught the sound of water dripping from a pod
of orchids suspended above a pyramid of soil. "I like it; it makes me
feel peaceful," said guest Jeff Cohen. "But I don't like the smell of
the dirt." The event raised about $40,000 for the Music Center's
Spotlight Awards program for aspiring high school visual and
performing artists.</LD>
<LD>   Downing Hama Hama oysters-on-the-half-shell while standing
up--wine glasses, handbags and art catalogs in hand. Impossible.
"Just slurp 'em down," a cook from Ocean Avenue Seafood told hungry
guests.</LD>
<TE>   Center Launch</TE>
<TE>   Bejeweled and bow-tied, hundreds of theater buffs celebrated the
opening of South Coast Repertory's new Folino Theatre Center at a
gala netting $430,000 for its annual fund. Launching Orange County's
social season, the recent "Light the Night" benefit featured the
first illumination of the $19-million Costa Mesa facility designed by
noted architect Cesar Pelli. "We have created an instrument," Pelli
said of the building that houses the Segerstrom and Julianne Argyros
stages. "The art of playing the instrument is what this [gala] is all
about." SCR trustee Sue Stern was gala co-chairwoman.</TE>
<TE>   For giving the theater $10 million--the largest single donation in
its history--SCR presented Emulex Corp.'s Paul Folino and his wife,
Daranne, with a DeBeers 24-karat gold hourglass filled with 2,000
tiny diamonds. "Now that's a timepiece," whispered one wide-eyed
guest.</TE>

<LD>Part 5: The story so far: Elaine is the new kid in school but she is
finally starting to make friends.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   I can't believe how different things are at school. I actually
wanted to go to school this morning!</LD>
<TE>   Ms. Howard said that she should have had me stand up in front of
the class and tell everyone a little about myself on my first day.
She asked if I would like to do it this morning and I said sure.</TE>
<TE>   This is what I said:</TE>
<TE>   Hi, my name is Elaine and I am 8 years old. I just moved here and
I'm the new kid--but I guess you know that. The thing is that it's
really, really hard being the new kid. And I think that maybe we
should try to make it a little easier for the next new kid at this
school. Maybe we could start a buddy program like they had at my old
school. That way a new kid wouldn't have to feel so alone and funny.
Anyway, that's about all I have to say except I have a dog and his
name is Charlie, my favorite color is red and I love to read--a lot!</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Howard thanked me and said that was the best idea she had
heard in a long time. So the next new kid will have a buddy.</TE>
<TE>   At lunch, Kathy, the fruit cocktail girl, has told me she has a
gecko ... that's a little lizard. She told me to come over after
school next week to meet him. I never met a gecko but I want to. She
likes Nancy Drew too.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's this kid, Ben, who has read every Harry Potter
book 25 times, and he has a desert turtle named Sidney. They want to
meet my dog, Charlie, too.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen and Ben and I are going to work on a team science project
together.</TE>
<TE>   At lunch today, my old table was back, but no one was sitting
there. Ellen and Ben asked me to sit with them. It was totally cool.
We even had tacos for lunch! And my apple tasted great!</TE>
<TE>   Now I can't wait for school on Monday! I knew it would get better!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cherie Troped loves to write stories and knows that it's really,
really hard to be the new kid. This story will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.com/kids. A new, five-part story begins Monday.</TE>

<HD>A French New Wave</HD>
<DH>Surfer scene inspires hot-weather fashions that leave the
cliches behind</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PARIS--The world capital of fashion has a "Blue Crush" on surfing.</LD>
<LD>   Like the all-girl surfing movie that washed over screens this
summer, fashion for the hot months of next year is riding a wave of
ocean-inspired fashion. As nine days of nonstop fashion shows end
here today, many designers endorsed the "sports" in sportswear but
skipped the predictable interpretations.</LD>
<LD>   The California surfer's sleek wetsuit is the latest image to
inspire designers, but don't expect to see a revival of
Hawaiian-print shirts and board shorts. Spring's trends are an odd
assortment of military looks, romantic blouses, punk-rock accents and
miniskirts and shorts. Still, the inventor of sexy, neoprene
swimwear, Body Glove designer Robin Piccone of Los Angeles, should be
feeling confident of her place in fashion history with these Parisian
trendsetters following in her sand-and-saltwater footsteps.</LD>
<TE>   When Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld sent out a finale of double-C
logo surfboards, kites, swim fins and a host of rubber accessories,
fashion needed no other endorsement to jump into the water. Unlike
Nicolas Ghesquiere at Balenciaga earlier this week, Lagerfeld avoided
literal riffs on wetsuits for daytime wear. Instead, he added the
surprise of a neoprene jacket to the largely black, white and
pale-pink classic sportswear. His new swimwear features cheeky,
low-cut boy-shorts and a host of accessories, including rubber Chanel
bags and loads of logo-stamped gear--just the thing to aid civil
disputes. Maybe if swimmers toted statusy Chanel surfboards and swim
fins past Malibu mogul David Geffen's property, he'd never have
fought public access to the beach below his home.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those tres chic deep-sea accessories will probably be on
the wish lists of Chanel loyalists, said Catherine Kiek, director of
the Beverly Hills boutique.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we'll get a couple of those surfboards," she said, knowing
from past experience that the Chanel logo can sell everything from
motorcycle helmets to furry apres-ski boots.</TE>
<TE>   The sizable collection played to an international audience of
buyers whose biggest challenge will be paring down the choices. They
can select from ruffled micro-minis, chiffon gowns with trains and a
new high-waist silhouette. After 20 years of tweaking the famous
Chanel signatures, Lagerfeld hasn't run out of ways to update the
collarless chenille jacket, the swags of pearls and chains and the
image of Mademoiselle Coco herself. With a punk-rock bent, he put her
image on medallions linked to chain belts slung low and heavy. Coco's
silhouette was woven into sweaters and her face printed on the kind
of round pins that punkers once stabbed through their motorcycle
jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Lagerfeld still cuts a lean, mean Chanel jacket, but he's not
about to miss the wave of big shapes that's come ashore. With rows of
tucks on each side of the hip, Lagerfeld debuted an extra-wide-leg
pant and full miniskirt, along with an up-to-the-bust, high-waist
pant and skirt.</TE>
<TE>   Though most jackets and sweaters are narrow and trim, Lagerfeld
unveiled a Chanel jacket shape with broad shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ford at Yves Saint Laurent also squared out the shoulders,
sometimes in a neat, ladylike jacket, or even in a beaded,
square-shoulder cape worthy of Liberace. It wasn't Vegas flash that
Ford was after, but the surrealism of Salvador Dali, with a little
help from the YSL archives and Sigmund Freud. Ford's sexual
preoccupation took on a literal translation that poured right onto
the surface of clothes. Jacket fronts were darted and tucked into
rosette nipples, silk flowers bloomed from bust lines like giant
pasties and seams outlined panty shapes on leather skirts. The
blouses with an X-ray spine etched into them were fun in a Halloween
kind of way.</TE>
<TE>   But the question of the evening was just what makeup product
colored the models' nipples purple, brown or black, which were then
intentionally framed by plunging, off-kilter necklines? (Paint, we're
told.) Is that why "Purple Haze" rang throughout the show? Though the
trapunto stitching that swirled into bosoms on a mauve satin coat was
wonderfully wicked, it is the designer equivalent of the classic
Harley-Davidson T-shirt that reads, "Put something exciting between
your legs." Not subtle, and surely Ford can do better.</TE>
<TE>   At least Ford charted a new direction for the sex obsession that
has seen latex skirts, bondage-strap pants, fetish-worthy high heels
and bold lingerie pop up on many runways here. If it's latex you
want, West Hollywood, not Rodeo Drive, is your destination.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Paul Gaultier also went through the lingerie drawer for
inspiration. While many pretty young things are busy flashing their
thong panties from the tops of extra-low pants, Gaultier did them one
better. He dropped the "waist" line of hip-huggers to below the
crotch and let wildly patterned pantyhose tops show off. Of course,
walking became nearly impossible for the models, but they seemed
happier with their Alexander Calder-inspired dresses and bikinis.
Gaultier cut out colorful, abstract shapes of plastic and linked them
into modern-art swimwear, or suspended them in cutout dresses and
pants. With a mosaic of linked pieces circling the hips, Gaultier
allowed plenty of peekaboo on pants but updated the tired low-riding
trend.</TE>
<TE>   Yohji Yamamoto unveiled his new Y-3 collection, a new Adidas
project for which he serves as creative director. Y-3 is a new, third
division for Adidas, which has collaborated on exclusive shoe
collections with the Japanese designer for three seasons. The new
label includes men's and women's wear, unisex footwear and a top tier
of artistic active wear that in the United States will sell only at
Maxfield in L.A. and Barneys in New York. Twenty U.S. stores will
carry the larger collection of such core pieces as wetsuit-inspired
neoprene jackets, tops and shorts, along with classics updated with
new three-stripe logos. Though at prices of up to $1,500 for
exclusives, few customers will break a sweat in this designer-label
finery. The line's creative striped logos, sexy shapes and attention
to details will raise the standards for active wear and have
manufacturers sweating over how to copy it.</TE>
<TE>   Even Valentino was in a sporty frame of mind, though he's leagues
removed from the court or gym. There is virtually no equal to
Valentino's ability to create refined sportswear for women of all
ages. His perfectly executed collection of sleek, cream daywear
accented with golden hoop insets, flowing, print chiffon evening
gowns and safari-inspired jungle jackets was well-timed. Displayed
the morning after President Bush virtually promised a war with Iraq,
Valentino made a point by stretching Andy Warhol's "Camouflage 1986"
silk-screen across his runway's backdrop. Pacifist Valentino titled
his collection "No War. Just War-hol" and let a gentle mood, fun
fringed bags and beautiful prints of banana leaves and abstract art
carry the delighted audience into a calm state of mind.</TE>
<TE>   Even next to established designers, newcomer Phoebe Philo at Chloe
delivered an impressive collection of neatly controlled silhouettes.
Blame Philo, and Lagerfeld and Valentino, if fashion design schools
get swamped with applications next semester. Their well-executed and
thoughtfully realized clothes made the job of fashion designer look
not only glamorous, but also really easy.</TE>
<TE>   Philo's tulip-shaped dress silhouettes carried the vague air of
'60s shifts without looking stale and retro. Rather, adorned with bib
necklaces, they gave a sexy curve to satin cocktail attire. Her smock
tops, paper-bag-waist pants and rolled up shorts were clever twists
on the cinched-up big shapes that mimic architecture's "compression
and release" aesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   While other designers dived neatly into the ocean for inspiration,
Julien Macdonald got stuck in fishnet at Givenchy, where he continues
to flounder like a fish out of water. The drawstring waist jackets
looked cozy, though not exactly original. The vivid mesh and applique
beach cover-ups, chunky bangle bracelets and 4-foot strands of bead
fringe on tight dresses summoned visions of Miami Beach, circa 1982,
a very bad year.</TE>
<TE>   Though Ennio Capasa at Costume National also used lingerie as a
shortcut to seduction, the man has a way with coats. It's rare that a
gal can put on a black coat that covers her to the knees and wrists
and still look fetching. His secret? Cut it to show thigh, accent the
waist and hug the arms. The Italian designer's corsetry seaming,
latex dress straps, bared shoulders and micro-minis also helped him
achieve the "unconventional eroticism" theme of his collection.</TE>
<TE>   It was, in all, a solid and creative season here, perhaps one of
the best in years. Clearly, the city remains the heart and soul of
high fashion. Still, when that soul needs its war-wary spirits
lifted, it's nice to know that the beach is still a source of solace
and inspiration. Hang ten, baby.</TE>

<LD>When the Swedish Academy awarded Hungarian writer Imre Kertesz the
2002 Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday, it once again recognized
not only aesthetic excellence but also an author's particular
relevance to the moral moment in which the world finds itself.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, when the prize went to V.S. Naipaul, the ruins of the
World Trade Center still were smoking and thousands of the dead
remained unaccounted for. A British subject, born in Trinidad of East
Indian parents, Naipaul's entire life and work represent a majestic
condemnation of the vile sectarianism and intolerance that produced
Sept. 11's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In the months since, one of the most alarming international trends
has been the rise of anti-Semitism, some of it fueled by the very
groups that attacked New York and the Pentagon, some of it promoted
by Arab governments, some it the work of Islamic emigres and
right-wing political thugs who have set upon Jewish institutions
across Europe. Recently, some British and American scholars have gone
so far as to attempt organized boycotts of their Israeli colleagues
out of purported sympathy for the Palestinian cause.</LD>
<TE>   By selecting Kertesz, the Swedish Academy has powerfully summoned
the world of literature and--through it--the community of ideas to
weigh carefully where the slander and hatred of Jews may lead.</TE>
<TE>   The 72-year-old Kertesz, a Budapest-born Jew and the first
Hungarian to win the prize, was arrested by the Nazis in 1944 and
deported, first to Auschwitz and then to Buchenwald, from which he
was liberated in 1945. On his return to Hungary, he worked briefly as
a journalist, then turned to fiction and essays, as well as to
translating philosophical and psychoanalytic texts, including those
of Nietzsche and Freud.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of his work, which the academy singled out for special
recognition, is a trio of novels, which appear to be
semiautobiographical reflections on the Holocaust. The first,
"Fateless," recounts the story of a young man who survives a
concentration camp through utter conformity, physical and
psychological. "The shocking credibility of the description derives
perhaps from this very absence of any element of the moral
indignation and metaphysical protest that the subject cries out for,"
the academy wrote. "For him, Auschwitz is not an exceptional
occurrence. It is the ultimate truth about human degradation in
modern experience."</TE>
<TE>   The trilogy's second volume is "Fiasco," whose protagonist writes
a novel concerning Auschwitz, which he expects will be rejected.
When--to his astonishment--it is published, he feels only deep
emptiness and experiences acclaim as a loss of privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "If I think of a new book," Kertesz once said, "I think of
Auschwitz."</TE>
<TE>   The final novel in the sequence is "Kaddish for a Child Not Born,"
whose narrator is a middle-aged Holocaust survivor working as a
writer and translator. Looking back over a failed marriage and a
disappointing career, he agonizes most deeply over his unwillingness
to bring a child into an irredeemably cruel world.</TE>
<TE>   Only the trilogy's first and second volumes are available in
English. None of his collections of shorter work, including "The
Holocaust as Culture" and "Moments of Silence While the Execution
Squad Reloads," has yet found an English-language publisher. Taken as
a whole, Kertesz's work "upholds the fragile experience of the
individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history," the
Swedish Academy wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a great writer," Nobel Peace Laureate Elie Wiesel said
Thursday. "His style and his approach are of such high quality that
he deserved to be given this highest prize in literature."</TE>
<TE>   Kertesz, who is currently teaching in Berlin, said he hopes the
award will awaken his countrymen to their own history. "There is no
awareness of the Holocaust in Hungary," he said. "People have not
faced up to the Holocaust. I hope that in the light of this
recognition, they will face up to it."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night, the author received another honor, Germany's
Hans-Sahl Prize for Literature. In his acceptance remarks, he said
that those willing to ponder the continuing significance of the death
camps should look first to the writer-witnesses of his generation.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the last," he said. "Ask us."</TE>
<TE>   Dryden Project Complete</TE>
<TE>   A monument of supreme importance to everyone who reads or writes
the English language was completed this week at UCLA. No ceremony
will mark the occasion, however, for this memorial--53 years in the
making--is constructed not of bricks, but of books: 20 volumes of
12,217 pages, published by the University of California Press,
representing the complete works of John Dryden, the 17th century
poet, playwright, critic and translator.</TE>
<TE>   It is to Dryden, the Restoration's towering literary figure, that
contemporary readers and writers of English owe the structure of the
sentences they now take for granted, their admiration of the rhymed
couplet as a satiric vehicle, heroic tragedy as a dramatic form and
dramatic criticism as a distinct genre.</TE>
<TE>   The last complete collection of his protean output was assembled
in 18 volumes in 1808 by Sir Walter Scott and revised later that
century by the English scholar George Saintsbury. In the late 1940s,
scholars in UCLA's English department realized that the rare book
collection in their Williams Andres Clark Memorial Library housed the
finest Dryden collection outside the British Library. They began to
assemble a team to publish a definite Dryden collection with all the
benefits of modern commentary.</TE>
<TE>   One of those drawn to the project was a 28-year-old Harvard
graduate student named Vinton Dearing, who had helped one of his
professors compile a collection of Alexander Pope's correspondence.
In 1948, he joined the UCLA faculty and its Dryden project. This
week, as emeritus professor of English, he oversaw publication of the
collection's final volume as the series' editor in chief.</TE>
<TE>   What have 53 years of familiarity with subject taught him?</TE>
<TE>   "There are a couple of things that often are overlooked about
Dryden," said Dearing, who retired from teaching in 1991. "One of
them is how well he could write prose. The other has to do with his
impact on the English language. You know, he walked in Oliver
Cromwell's funeral procession with John Milton, and I think that was
a fateful conjunction. Milton, of course, believed that English prose
should resemble Latin as closely as possible with the verbs at the
end of clauses and sentences. Dryden was a master of the easier
vernacular style. He thought that written English ought to do what
spoken English did--begin a sentence with its subject followed by the
verb and the object. As far as I'm concerned, he was the source of
how we write prose today."</TE>
<TE>   As an example of the author's spiritual authenticity, Dearing
quotes a bit of verse the poet composed at the dinner table of
Elizabeth Creed, a relative he admired:</TE>
<TE>   So much religion in your name doth dwell</TE>
<TE>   Your soul must needs in piety excel.</TE>
<TE>   For in you, belief and practice do together go</TE>
<TE>   My prayers shall be while this short life endures</TE>
<TE>   These may go hand in hand in you and yours.</TE>
<TE>   As Dearing points out, the sentiments were reciprocated in a
memorial plaque Creed erected in her village church after Dryden's
death:</TE>
<TE>   "We boasted he was bred and had his first learning here, where he
has often made us happy by his kind visits and most delightful
conversation. Afer 70 odd years, when nature could be no longer
supported he received the notice of his approaching dissolution with
sweet submission and entire resignation to the Divine will and he
took so tender and obliging a farewell of his friends as none but he
himself could have expressed (of which sorrowful number I was one)."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The appearance of designer mini-dresses, short-shorts and ruffled
miniskirts no bigger than the valance on your kitchen windows might
once have been taken as a sign of good things to come--for the
economy.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly a century, as economic outlooks and stock market
indexes rose, so did hemlines, though not exactly in perfectly timed
tandem. Exuberance begat sex appeal, recessions brought dowdiness.
Now things seem to be headed the other way around. As news broke
about the Dow industrial average and the NASDAQ scraping the gutters,
designers from New York to London to Milan and now here hiked
hemlines.</LD>
<LD>   Already, it's a style shift that's meeting resistance. "I think
the looks are a little too mini," said Linda Wells, editor in chief
of Allure magazine. "It's nice to see a change, but these are really
short. It's unforgiving."</LD>
<TE>   Designers aren't cutting hems high because fabric is expensive.
They're trying to advance fashion. So said Anna Wintour, editor in
chief of Vogue magazine, who takes a "something for everyone"
approach to the spring collections.</TE>
<TE>   "The sexpot, Barbarella look is fine for the beach or the
nightclub. Or for a young girl," she said. The real message "is more
about designers trying to get everyone's eye attuned to a different
length. To me, it's an option." Wintour, for example, loved the mini
wetsuit dresses from Balenciaga.</TE>
<TE>   Mini makers may be cutting their future profits if they insist on
the shortest of short for spring. They probably won't, though.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the things on the runway are there for a point," said
Julie Gilhart, vice president of fashion merchandising for Barneys
New York. "They'll be longer when they're in the stores," she said,
promising an extension of at least three inches. Gucci designer Tom
Ford, however, said he would allow only about four-inch extensions to
his ultra-short dresses. There is a market for that kind of thing,
particularly in the land of the professionally thin and beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   "Short skirts are a natural for Los Angeles," said Gilhart, who
predicted that the Beverly Hills Barneys will stock high hemlines,
along with other skirt looks.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the mid-'90s, the last time when designers widely endorsed
the ultra-short look, spring's new collections almost always include
hemline options. Skirts and dresses end at or above the knee or drag
the floor, but few hit between mid-calf and ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Though the realistic minis and ladylike knee-length skirts won't
be mistaken for a belt, retailers like the message the itty-bitty
skirts send: youth, fitness, sex appeal--and maybe the hope of a
stronger retail season.</TE>

<HD>NBC Ousts Executive Producer of 'Today'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After behind-the-scenes tension at the "Today" show, NBC on Thursday
decided to replace the morning show's top producer, Jonathan Wald,
two network executives said.</LD>
<LD>   Former "Good Morning America" senior producer Tom Touchet is a
leading candidate to replace Wald, one NBC executive said.</LD>
<LD>   Wald, 36, became executive producer of the "Today" show in May
2001, replacing Jeff Zucker, who was promoted to NBC entertainment
president. Previously, Wald had been executive producer of "NBC
Nightly News." He is expected to remain at the network in another
post.</LD>
<TE>   Under Wald, the "Today" show maintained its ratings dominance. The
program, anchored by Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, during the last
year has averaged 6.1 million viewers, or 1.5 million more than ABC's
"Good Morning America." ABC has nibbled into the lead of "Today,"
last week narrowing the gap to 1.1 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   NBC executives said the shake-up had little to do with ratings.
"They thought it would be better to make a change before they had a
problem," one executive said.</TE>
<TE>   NBC sources said all was not sunny on the "Today" set. Couric and
Lauer "lost confidence in the guy," one executive said.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, USA Today reported that Couric angrily confronted
Wald after ABC's Diane Sawyer got an exclusive interview with a
rescued Pennsylvania miner. ABC also made a deal with the miners for
a TV movie.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, NBC executives were furious that ABC showed segments
of a Ted Koppel interview with Bruce Springsteen after NBC had been
assured an exclusive.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the "Today" show canceled Lauer's planned trip to Cuba,
saying the government had reneged on a promised interview with
President Fidel Castro. Instead, ABC's Barbara Walters landed the
interview, and "Good Morning America" aired excerpts.</TE>

<HD>Massachusetts Calls for Fine, Reform by CSFB</HD>
<DH>Brokerages: Demands could complicate efforts toward
industrywide settlement. Also, U.S. attorney seeks data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Massachusetts securities regulators are demanding that Credit Suisse
First Boston pay a fine of at least $100 million and clearly separate
its stock research from investment banking to settle the state's
civil investigation of the firm's practices, sources said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan has sent a letter to
Massachusetts officials requesting documents from their CSFB probe,
sources said--an indication that federal criminal prosecutors are
looking more closely into alleged conflicts of interest on Wall
Street.</LD>
<LD>   Though civil investigations have garnered more attention, James
Comey, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York,
reportedly has been studying whether brokerage conduct rose to the
level of criminal wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   His request for information was discussed Thursday during a
conference call among state securities regulators. A spokesman for
Comey had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Massachusetts' demands for restitution and reforms by
CSFB could complicate efforts to arrange a universal settlement
between major brokerages and state and federal regulators to end
their various probes.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, under Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt, has sought to broker a universal settlement. But state
regulators have worried that Pitt wouldn't be tough enough in forcing
industry reforms.</TE>
<TE>   In their settlement talks with CSFB, Massachusetts regulators have
insisted that the firm consent to a penalty of at least $100 million,
to be paid to Massachusetts and other states, sources said. That is
the amount Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. paid this year to end a similar probe
by New York.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators have been investigating allegations of widespread
misconduct by brokerages during the bull market. The allegations
include that brokerages gave executives of favored clients shares in
hot new stock deals, and that analysts routinely recommended stocks
solely to curry favor with the companies' executives.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts has gathered a number of e-mails in which CSFB
analysts indicated they felt internal pressure to hype stocks of CSFB
investment banking clients.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails and other documents have spurred calls for brokerages
to completely separate research from investment banking. But industry
officials and regulators have differed on how to best achieve a
genuine separation.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts officials have demanded that CSFB's parent, Credit
Suisse Group, create a subsidiary into which it would transfer its
research unit, sources said. The firm also would have to implement
other measures, such as having the parent company rather than the
banking department fund research.</TE>
<TE>   The state's settlement demands were outlined in a call Wednesday
morning between Massachusetts regulators and their counterparts in
about two dozen states.</TE>
<TE>   However, CSFB later balked at the requirement that research be
sequestered in a separate subsidiary and the talks have bogged down
over that point, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian McNiff, a spokesman for Massachusetts Secretary of State
William Galvin, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   At CSFB, a spokeswoman said: "We cannot comment on any discussions
we may or may not be having with regulators and state officials. But
as we've said, we continue to cooperate with all government officials
and regulatory authorities on these matters."</TE>
<TE>   Though state and federal regulators recently joined forces to
negotiate a unified settlement with Wall Street, they have yet to
agree on a consensus set of demands.</TE>
<TE>   The talks between CSFB and Massachusetts are aimed at resolving
the probe by that state in conjunction with other states. Any deal
also could be incorporated into a global settlement, if one is
reached.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts' Galvin has said any settlement would have to
clearly wall off research from investment banking. Among other
demands, Massachusetts wants Credit Suisse's compliance and legal
department to oversee stock research. Also, investment bankers could
not order the hiring or firing of analysts, nor have input in
performance reviews of analysts. And CSFB could not promise research
coverage when it is seeking banking work from companies.</TE>
<TE>   As the SEC and state regulators have pursued civil cases to force
Wall Street reform, a big question has been whether criminal
prosecutors also might seek to charge individuals or firms.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't clear whether U.S. Atty. Comey's interest in the
investigations could delay efforts to reach a universal settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts last month recommended that New York Atty. Gen.
Eliot Spitzer consider filing criminal charges against CSFB under a
state law that gives prosecutors great leverage in bringing criminal
fraud cases against securities firms.</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq May Rethink Delisting Rules</HD>
<DH>Trading: The market, which already has eased requirements
for stocks under $1, may consider new steps to help more companies
stay listed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Nasdaq Stock Market may have to rethink whether shares trading
under $1 should automatically be pushed off its market, given the
sheer number of companies whose stocks have been pummeled under that
threshold, Nasdaq's chief said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Any such change in listing rules could throw a lifeline to many
California companies whose stocks now are threatened with delisting
from Nasdaq--a move that would effectively banish them from many or
most investors' radar screens.</LD>
<LD>   Nasdaq Chairman Hardwick Simmons, speaking at the Security Traders
Assn. annual conference in Boca Raton, Fla., said about 500 of
Nasdaq's 3,800 stocks are priced under $1, as the long bear market
has hammered equity values.</LD>
<TE>   "That's putting us to the test of whether we want to change our
old rules about delisting stocks trading under $1," he said. "Some of
these are real companies with real balance sheets."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons did not give specifics about revising Nasdaq's rules, and
Nasdaq representatives in Washington offered no further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq already has taken steps to help companies that are in
danger of violating its listing rules. Under previous rules, a
company on the Small Cap market (the lower tier of Nasdaq) whose
stock fell below $1 for 30 days had 90 days to bring the shares back
above that level before facing delisting. Nasdaq extended that grace
period to 180 days in January.</TE>
<TE>   "If a company's stock price goes under a dollar, the company knows
best what kinds of transactions will enhance its business and
financial stability, many of which take longer than 90 days to
complete," said Helen Scott, co-chair of Nasdaq's listing and hearing
review council.</TE>
<TE>   After the initial grace period, if a company meets one of three
listing standards--market capitalization of $50 million, net annual
income of $750,000 or stockholders' equity of $5 million--the firm
can apply for an additional 180-day grace period to bring its stock
price back up.</TE>
<TE>   The loosened rules have helped reduce the number of Nasdaq
delistings this year, despite the continuing bear market. Through
August, 188 companies were deleted from Nasdaq, a 42% decrease from
the 324 firms deleted during the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of those deletions are formal delistings: Some companies
disappear through mergers or because they start listing on the New
York Stock Exchange. But Nasdaq representatives say the decline in
deletions this year is in part because of the longer grace periods.</TE>
<TE>   Even the new grace periods, however, haven't been enough to help
some companies escape delisting. Nasdaq this year has delisted
California companies including IPrint Technologies Inc., a Santa
Clara online printing service; VantageMed Corp.; a Rancho
Cordova-based software healthcare information firm; and Aqua Care
Systems Inc., a Vista-based maker of water filtration systems.</TE>
<TE>   With a Nasdaq address, companies can maintain an image of
respectability and potentially maintain brokerage research coverage.
Delisting usually pushes a stock from Nasdaq to the OTC Bulletin
Board or the so-called Pink Sheets market. Those are electronic
markets, like Nasdaq. But stocks listed on those markets can become
nearly invisible to many investors, jeopardizing a company's ability
to raise capital.</TE>
<TE>   "When a company is delisted entirely, at that point it becomes
extremely difficult to develop a turnaround plan," said Michael Emen,
a senior vice president of listing qualifications for Nasdaq. The
longer grace periods give companies "time to raise more capital and
turn their business around. Then we've helped shareholders and we've
helped the company," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While some critics say Nasdaq shouldn't be helping "penny stock"
companies to attract new capital--given the historically high risk
inherent in such shares--others argue that there also is a fairness
issue with regard to current shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "Who should the markets favor? Would-be shareholders, existing
shareholders, the customers?" said Junius Peake, professor of finance
at the University of Northern Colorado and an expert on Nasdaq. "As
long as the proper disclosure is being made, there's not a problem
here."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>EchoStar-DirecTV Deal Blocked by Regulators</HD>
<DH>Television: The FCC unanimously rules that a merger would
harm consumers. Firms plan to modify proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Communications Commission blocked EchoStar Communications
Corp.'s proposed $16-billion buyout of satellite television rival
DirecTV on Thursday, declaring the harm to consumers would be
"staggering."</LD>
<LD>   The FCC's four commissioners brushed aside EchoStar's last-minute
offer to amend the merger and unanimously ruled that a combination of
the nation's No. 1 and No. 2 satellite television companies would
stifle competition and innovation, lead to higher prices for
consumers and hurt the quality of service.</LD>
<LD>   "The combination of EchoStar and DirecTV would have us replace a
vibrant competitive market with a regulated monopoly," FCC Chairman
Michael K. Powell said at a news conference in Washington. "This
flies in the face of three decades of communications policy."</LD>
<TE>   The decision marks the first time since 1967 that the FCC has
voted to halt a major merger. Analysts said it sets the stage for a
potentially massive legal battle, either between the government and
the two companies, or between the two companies themselves, fighting
over who is to blame for the merger's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC vote also is the most significant ruling since Powell and
his fellow commissioners were appointed by President Bush last year.
The vote surprised EchoStar and its aggressive chairman, Charlie
Ergen, who may have underestimated the opposition to the merger and
the skepticism and resentment he faced from government regulators,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC left the door open for EchoStar and DirecTV to modify the
deal within the next 30 days. But commission officials said it was
unlikely that any changes--including the divestiture of some
satellite slots to create a new national satellite provider--would be
enough to address their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed merger of EchoStar and DirecTV was announced with
great fanfare last October and would have created the nation's
largest pay-television company, with more than 18 million customers.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar, based in Littleton, Colo., owns the Dish Network. Hughes
Electronics Corp., based in El Segundo, owns DirecTV, and is a unit
of General Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   With prospects for government approval now dim, GM will be eager
to move on and start searching for a new buyer for Hughes, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   The most likely buyer is Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which
lobbied heavily to block the deal and lost a bidding war for DirecTV
a year ago. Managers at DirecTV also have talked about proposing a
management buyout, sources said, though Hughes executives deny that
any formal plans are underway.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, EchoStar and Hughes vowed Thursday to press ahead
with a revamped merger proposal, which the companies plan to present
this month to the FCC and the Justice Department, which also is
leaning against approving the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We still want the merger to go through," said Richard Dore, a
spokesman for Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   The two satellite TV rivals have contended that a combined company
would enable them to better compete against local cable TV providers
by offering more local channels than they currently can, and rolling
out additional services such as high-speed Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   But the EchoStar-DirecTV proposal drew strong opposition from
broadcasters and several rural communities, which feared the combined
company would have a pay-TV monopoly in markets that can't receive
cable.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the FCC agrees to suspend its decision over the next 30
days, the agency will refer the merger next to an administrative law
judge. EchoStar and DirecTV have the right to ask the judge to review
the FCC's ruling. But it's an expensive, time-consuming process that
is seldom exercised. Most companies opt to drop their merger.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV Chief Executive Eddy Hartenstein said Wednesday that he
did not expect the companies to extend their previously established
Jan. 21 deadline for closing the merger, and it's highly unlikely
that an administrative hearing could be completed by then.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC ruling breaks with tradition because historically the
agency has delayed merger decisions until after the Justice
Department completes its antitrust review. That allowed the FCC to
consider the Justice Department's findings and avoid the
embarrassment of approving a merger later rejected by another
government agency.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell has hinted for months that he might not wait until the
Justice Department announced its decision. Some accused him of
political grandstanding, but others said the decision to move
independently reflects Powell's no-nonsense style and confidence that
the EchoStar-DirecTV merger would be bad for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   FCC officials also were irritated by EchoStar's last-minute
attempt Monday to revise the deal and Ergen's sudden request for a
public hearing, which insiders viewed as a disingenuous delaying
tactic. They note that EchoStar has still not submitted any formal
request to modify the deal.</TE>
<TE>   FCC Media Bureau Chief W. Kenneth Ferree said EchoStar's record
was a factor in the review, particularly when the agency considered
whether the company could be relied upon to live up to the promises
it made in the merger application.</TE>
<TE>   He said the commission rejected EchoStar's assertion that it does
not compete against DirecTV, and concluded that the promised benefits
of the merger were either speculative or too modest.</TE>
<TE>   "EchoStar and DirecTV ... compete vigorously, not only with cable
but with each other," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Although EchoStar offered to create a national pricing system to
ensure that rural customers would not pay exorbitant rates, the
commission found that such a scheme would, in effect, replace the
free market with government-regulated rates.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts predict that the FCC's rejection may splinter the fragile
partnership of EchoStar and DirecTV, two rivals that have spent the
last year trying to put up a united front.</TE>
<TE>   But if the deal falls apart, the companies probably will return to
being full-time rivals, leading to a "litigation lollapalooza," said
Blair Levin, a former FCC official and an analyst at Legg Mason in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect the parties to sue each other for breakup fees, with
both sides blaming the other for the deal's demise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the deal collapses, the merger contract calls for EchoStar to
pay Hughes a $600-million termination fee and to purchase Hughes'
stake in satellite operator PanAmSat for $2.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect Ergen to search for ways to reduce or avoid the
breakup fee. But even if the deal fails, EchoStar emerges a winner
because it has kept its chief rival tied up for a year, gotten a
closer look at DirecTV's books and prevented a takeover by News
Corp., analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Ergen also is expected to modify the deal to appease regulators.
One possibility involves New York-based Cablevision Systems Corp.,
which is offering to take over some of EchoStar's satellite slots and
create a nationwide service.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision Chairman Charles F. Dolan said Thursday that he hoped
to work with EchoStar to restructure their plan. But regulators
remain skeptical that Cablevision has the money or technology to
offer a competitive national satellite service.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's shares fell 3 cents Thursday to $16.98 on Nasdaq.
Hughes' shares fell 25 cents to $8.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Television, Film Production Staging a Rebound in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Sharp rise in activity surprises unions, economists and
suppliers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's no longer quiet on the set in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   After a painful yearlong slump, Southern California film and TV
production is enjoying a surprisingly strong resurgence greater than
unions, suppliers and economists expected.</LD>
<LD>   The main reason is that studios have finally burned off the fat
supply of films stockpiled last year as a precaution against possible
strikes by actors and writers. But TV production also is surging as
the advertising outlook grows healthier. Hollywood's fantasy
factories are again operating at near capacity.</LD>
<TE>   "We're finally seeing a return to normal," UCLA economist Chris
Thornberg said.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in four years, all 30 soundstages at the Warner
Bros. lot in Burbank and five more at the studio's nearby ranch are
booked, thanks largely to the studio's brisk TV business. Last month,
shooting on the streets of Los Angeles rose 55% from a year earlier,
the highest September level since 1998, according to permit agency
Entertainment Industry Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In late August, Local 600 of the International Alliance of
Theatrical Stage Employees compiled a 24-page job report listing 11
feature films, six one-hour dramas and seven half-hour shows being
shot in the area. Last week, that same report rose to 85 pages
boasting 17 movies, 34 one-hour shows and 34 half-hour programs.</TE>
<TE>   Back also are the daily encounters with film shoots that were so
routine for L.A. residents. Colorful makeshift signs are showing up
more and more on street poles to direct crews. Streets are being shut
down, snarling traffic and forcing cars to maneuver around studio
trailers.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the Sony Pictures sequel "Charlie's Angels: Full
Throttle" was being filmed at the Griffith Observatory.
Paramount Pictures' remake of "The Italian Job" was being shot at the
Sepulveda Dam in Encino. The Harrison Ford action comedy "Hollywood
Homicide" began shooting around Los Angeles. A community of lavender
houses sits among the suburban Simi Valley sprawl as an outdoor set
for Universal Pictures' "Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat."</TE>
<TE>   "It's in full stride now," said Bob Harvey, senior vice president
of worldwide sales for camera rental company Panavision Inc. in
Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Still unclear is whether the production recovery is a temporary
spike with roots in last year's labor troubles, or whether it will
have legs. Economists and unions say the latest surge appears to
reflect additional production rather than any significant dent in
Hollywood's 20-year battle against runaway production to cheaper
locales.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to competition from Canada, historically the most
aggressive country at luring U.S. projects through low costs and
incentives, Hollywood is increasingly shipping productions to
Australia, Mexico, Ireland and New Zealand. None of the five films
nominated for best picture Oscars this year was shot in Los Angeles,
and only two of them in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as other nations are committed to luring away motion
pictures and TV producers with financial incentives, we're going to
be in for a fight," said Bruce Doering, national executive director
of the Cinematographers Guild.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the production rebound is good news for Hollywood's
blue-collar work force, marking the end of what became known as
2001's "de facto strike."</TE>
<TE>   Although writers and actors settled their contracts in May and
July of last year, respectively, studios had no reason to shoot new
projects. Fearing a dual strike that would shutter the industry,
projects were frenetically filmed in the months leading up to
negotiations as part of a broad contingency plan. After the
settlement, production came to a virtual halt.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really dead," camera operator Jeffrey Norvet said.
"Business had completely dried up. Now, there's a lot of work
around."</TE>
<TE>   Norvet's financial predicament was so bad that he moved to a
smaller home to cut his mortgage payments. Now he's back in demand,
putting in 19-hour days on such shows as NBC's "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Most affected in the slowdown were feature films. Because the time
required to prepare and film movies is so long, studios began
shooting up to a year in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, about one-third of the 4,000 drivers, location
managers and animal handlers represented by Teamsters Local 399 were
unemployed. Now the union might have to admit new members to keep up
with demand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incredible change," business agent Steve Dayan said.</TE>
<TE>   Job statistics reflect only modest increases. The Los Angeles
County Economic Development Corp. estimates film and TV production
employment in August at 229,100. Although up 14,000 from the bottom
reached in February, the number remains well below the more than
270,000 people estimated to be working in the business in Los Angeles
County in 1998 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But economists say the latest numbers lag behind the recent jump
and should soon begin to reflect it.</TE>
<TE>   Also benefiting from the upturn are scores of firms that supply
the industry. Nearly all of the 500 makeup, wardrobe and cast
trailers rented out by Star Waggons of Sylmar are spoken for. Earlier
this year, the company had to store and refurbish many of its
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't keep up with the demand," President Lyle Waggoner said.
"It's a great relief."</TE>
<TE>   Alf Jacobsen's Jet Mockups/AFTP was nearly evicted from its
Pacoima facility this year when business was bad. Now Jacobsen's
renting his airplane mock-ups to such TV shows as CBS' "Jag" and the
independent movie "Bikini Airways."</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't even get a phone call before," Jacobsen said. "Now
people are going full bore."</TE>

<HD>Realtors Say Home Price Rise to Slow</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Group says rate of increase in state may drop
to 10% in 2003, down from 18% this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California home prices will continue to rise next year, but at about
half the rate of this year's torrid pace of 18%, the California Assn.
of Realtors said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The projected increase would push the median cost of a
single-family home to a record $344,000 in 2003. That's a 10%
increase in the price of what's expected to be this year's median
home price of $313,000.</LD>
<LD>   Citing a dearth of new construction and a crowd of investors drawn
to real estate as the stock market falters, the Realtors group said
the forecast suggested that housing prices are returning to a more
normal rate of growth.</LD>
<TE>   "It's leveling out," said Robert Bailey, president of the
California Assn. of Realtors. "It's not an alarming number at all."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the forecast was higher than some other analysts expected
for next year.</TE>
<TE>   "A price rise of that level, with very little inflation, is a high
rate of increase and might not be sustainable," said Tom Lieser, a
senior economist at UCLA's Anderson School.</TE>
<TE>   With the Bay Area's economy still shaky, Southern California
prices would have to rise even more than 10%, which Lieser said is
unlikely, for the statewide average to be 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Home sales, meanwhile, are expected to decline 3% next year from
this year's record pace of 547,300, the Realtors group said. Bailey
said the record gains in sales and prices cannot be maintained,
leading to tempered expectations next year. But even with the drop,
sales are projected to post the third-highest mark ever.</TE>
<TE>   Interest rates still are helping to fuel home buying. In a
separate report Thursday, secondary mortgage investor Freddie Mac
said average 30-year rates edged down nationwide. Mortgage rates fell
to 5.98% from 6.01% last week, the lowest level since the company
began tracking weekly figures in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Falling interest rates have led to brisk activity in the housing
market. Industry groups estimate sales of new homes will reach a new
peak of 936,000 nationwide, while sales of previously owned homes
probably will top an all-time high of 5.53 million and break last
year's record.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the low rates have created a record amount of home
refinancings in California.</TE>
<TE>   Despite historically low mortgage rates, rising home prices pushed
more buyers out of the market during August.</TE>
<TE>   The Realtors group reported Thursday that only 28% of Californians
can afford to purchase a median-priced home, down 2 percentage points
from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Realtors group also said only 30% of Los Angeles County
residents were able to afford a median-priced home, down 4 percentage
points from a year ago. In Orange County, the percentage declined to
23% from 27%.</TE>
<TE>   The median home price statewide rose 18% in August from a year ago
to $334,100, the group said.</TE>

<HD>Director Who Helped Stabilize Homestore Quits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore Inc. said Thursday that it has lost a key director:
construction and finance expert Barbara T. Alexander, one of the
nation's leading housing analysts, who helped stabilize the Internet
real estate firm after a major accounting scandal erupted last fall.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander, 53, a senior advisor on investment banking deals at UBS
Warburg, joined Homestore's board in April 2001. She resigned to
devote more time to her other pursuits, the Westlake Village company
said.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander served on Homestore's audit committee, which met 63
times since November 2001, when the board learned that much of the
company's reported advertising sales were bogus under national
accounting standards.</LD>
<TE>   An exodus of top executives early this year was followed by
revelations that $160 million in Homestore revenue was improperly
recorded in 2000 and 2001. Three former Homestore executives agreed
last month to plead guilty to fraud and cooperate with government
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore's board, however, was given credit for its cooperation
by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and Securities and Exchange Commission
officials, who said they would not charge the company itself.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander supervised the reorganization of the firm's finances,
helped hire new management and worked to select and manage outside
lawyers and accountants who sorted out the mess, said Homestore
Chairman Joe Hanauer.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore said it has hired the executive search firm Spencer
Stuart to find new directors for the board, which has six remaining
members.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore shares rose 4 cents to 37 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Waksal Is Accused of Forgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An ImClone Systems Inc. lawyer accused company founder Samuel Waksal
of forging a stock certificate 16 years ago. The allegation came in
testimony Thursday before a House oversight panel investigating the
handling of ImClone's cancer drug Erbitux.</LD>
<LD>   General counsel John Landes never notified the company's board and
made the allegation for the first time before the committee. Waksal,
indicted Aug. 12 on insider trading, perjury and bank fraud charges,
allegedly forged the lawyer's signature on a 1986 document to sell
12,000 ImClone shares then valued at $90,000, Landes said.</LD>
<LD>   Revelations about Waksal, who was ImClone's chief executive until
he resigned in May, came as lawmakers grilled company executives
about oversight of the company and its most promising product.
ImClone executives said Waksal's leadership was more important than
what they characterized as his personal financial problems.</LD>
<TE>   "I regarded Sam Waksal as a visionary who started the company and
enabled c225, or Erbitux, to be brought to the company and
developed," said Paul Kopperl, chairman of ImClone's audit committee.</TE>
<TE>   Landes said he learned of the alleged forgery in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Pomerantz, Waksal's attorney, didn't return a message left
with his assistant seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration's rejection of ImClone's Erbitux
application, which the company disclosed Dec. 28, sent shares down
88% and led to three government probes. The New York-based
biotechnology company faces a dozen shareholder lawsuits claiming it
misled investors.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone shares fell 16 cents to $6.86 in New York Stock Exchange
trading.</TE>
<TE>   The panel asked directors about their oversight during what
lawmakers said was a pattern of spending abuse by Waksal.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, the company approved more than $1 million in
personal loans to Waksal. In July 2001, ImClone loaned him $18.2
million, which allowed him to exercise stock options and warrants.</TE>
<TE>   Board members told the panel that he has repaid "every penny."</TE>

<HD>Lions Gate Puts Kazaa Net to Use</HD>
<DH>Media: Other studios hate the file-sharing service; the
independent distributes trailers on it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the world's largest entertainment companies, the controversial
Kazaa file-sharing network is Public Enemy No. 1--a wildly popular
source of free, downloadable music and movies.</LD>
<LD>   But to Lions Gate Entertainment, an independent film studio based
in Marina del Rey, Kazaa is the means to a more profitable end.
Breaking ranks with mainstream Hollywood, the company is using Kazaa
to promote its big fall film through the Internet--with the financial
help of Microsoft Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Kazaa's software connects tens of millions of users to one
another's computers through the Internet, enabling them to easily
find and copy digital songs, movies, games and other files. Major
film and record companies call it the online equivalent of
shoplifting, and they are seeking an injunction against Kazaa from a
federal judge in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Lions Gate faces the same piracy problem, with unauthorized copies
of the film "Frailty," episodes of the TV program "The Dead Zone" and
many of its other productions freely available on Kazaa.
Nevertheless, it has been using the network to distribute up to
10,000 trailers each day for its forthcoming film "The Rules of
Attraction," a satirical look at sex and drugs on an affluent college
campus.</TE>
<TE>   There's no direct relationship between Lions Gate and Kazaa.
Instead, Kazaa users are being steered to the "Attraction" trailer by
Altnet, a Los Angeles-based service that helps copyright holders
deliver files securely over the Kazaa network.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Lions Gate paying Altnet for its services, said Tom DeLuca,
Lions Gate's vice president of new media. The undisclosed tab is
being picked up by Microsoft, which provided the software Lions Gate
used to digitize the trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't ignore these networks," DeLuca said. "The audience for
'Rules of Attraction,' they're the ones on the peer-to-peer
networks."</TE>
<TE>   Altnet's pitch to entertainment companies is simple: It offers
cheap distribution while deterring piracy. By relying on Kazaa users
to transmit more than 90% of its files to other users, Altnet can
distribute files virtually for free. And by wrapping those files in
electronic locks, it can protect against piracy and give copyright
owners a way to demand payment.</TE>
<TE>   To Lions Gate, using Altnet is a form of counterattack. "We know
that piracy is a problem, and this is our move to try to take control
of the situation," DeLuca said.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft declined to comment about its dealings with Altnet, a
subsidiary of Brilliant Digital Entertainment of Woodland Hills.
Altnet also is partly owned by Joltid, a company owned by the
developers of Kazaa's network.</TE>
<TE>   The major studios and record companies have kept their distance
from Altnet, in part because they don't want to complicate their
lawsuit against the companies that created and maintain Kazaa.
Kazaa's backers are trying to convince U.S. District Judge Stephen V.
Wilson that the network has a substantial legitimate use, which is a
defense against contributory copyright infringement.</TE>
<TE>   About 35 other companies have used Altnet to distribute
independent label music, games, software programs, adult content and
promotional material through Kazaa, said Kevin Bermeister, chief
executive of Brilliant and Altnet.</TE>
<TE>   Kazaa and Altnet collect a small fee each time one of these files
is downloaded, and Altnet also makes money by placing files on the
network and earning commissions when they are purchased.</TE>
<TE>   About 150,000 secure music and video files are being delivered
daily with Altnet's assistance, Bermeister said. Only 1.5% to 2% of
the free downloads are being converted to purchases.</TE>

<HD>Shares Stage Vigorous Rally, Interrupting a 7-Week Slide</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The Dow recovers strongly from an early tumble
to climb 247.68 points. Upbeat reports from Aetna, Yahoo buoy
investors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street interrupted its seven-week slide with a badly needed
rally Thursday as investors focused on several upbeat corporate
earnings reports.</LD>
<LD>   The market recovered strongly after a tumble in the first
half-hour that prompted at least one Wall Street strategist to
predict that stocks have hit their low point for the year.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average erased an early 88-point loss to
climb 247.68 points, or 3.4%, to 7,533.95, bouncing from Wednesday's
five-year low. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index soared 49.26
points, or 4.4%, to 1,163.37, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
rose 27.16 points, or 3.5%, to 803.92.</LD>
<TE>   Treasury yields surged as investors piled into stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investors weary of hearing that the 2 1/2-year-old bear
market has hit bottom had plenty of reason to be skeptical. Though
volume was heavy, winners topped losers by an unimpressive 10 to 7 on
Nasdaq and 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   But Rick Bensignor, technical strategist at Morgan Stanley in New
York, said he believes the market has seen its low for 2002: "It may
not be the low low--meaning the end of the bear market--but we could
see at least a 20% rally from here, and after that only time will
tell."</TE>
<TE>   Positive profit reports or forecasts from Aetna, Yahoo and others
helped stoke the day's move. Yahoo gained $2.29 to $12.27 after it
reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings after the market
closed Wednesday. And Aetna rose $5.11 to $36.80 after saying--also
late Wednesday--that its third-quarter profit would be double
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   But there was plenty of news to remind investors that robust
earnings growth may not come until 2003 or later.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing
for unemployment benefits fell below 400,000 last week. But analysts
noted that the four-week average--a more reliable gauge of economic
health--remains above 400,000 and still suggests that the labor
situation is deteriorating.</TE>
<TE>   Also, U.S. retailers in September posted their smallest sales
gains in a year, according to a report from the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Sales at such merchants as Wal-Mart Stores, Target
and Kohl's were less than forecast, although many retailers rode the
tide of the rising market. Wal-Mart gained 90 cents to $51.64 and
Target added $1.08 to $27.83. Kohl's, however, plunged $5 to $49.45.</TE>
<TE>   Also, fast-food operator Yum Brands, owner of Irvine-based Taco
Bell, fell $6.18 to $23.57 after reporting weak September sales at
its KFC chain. The S&amp;P index of restaurant stocks fell 2.4%</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, with war against Iraq still looming, many analysts
are doubtful the market can sustain Thursday's gains. Numerous
rallies have turned into one- or two-day wonders this year. Including
Thursday's bounce, the Dow has notched eight one-day gains of at
least 3% this year yet remains off 24.8% year-to-date.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of problems, the market has a history of rallying late
in the year, said Steve Colton, manager of the Phoenix-Oakhurst
Growth &amp; Income fund in Scotts Valley, Calif. Important lows often
have been reached during October.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not be selling stocks," Colton said. "There's a good
chance you might miss a fourth-quarter rally."</TE>
<TE>   Safe-haven investments suffered as stocks rallied Thursday. The
yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.66% from Wednesday's
close of 3.57%, while gold prices fell again, losing $3.10 to $316.50
an ounce in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   Among the highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The Dow utility index, which plunged 9.6% on Wednesday, surged
8.2%. American Electric Power jumped $3.51 to $21.20 after saying it
will discontinue speculative energy trading, and Duke Energy rose
$2.35 to $18.91.</TE>
<TE>   * Other stocks that were moving on positive earnings news included
data processor First Data, up $3.26 to $29.86; printer maker Lexmark
International, up $6.30 to $51.40; and software maker Network
Associates, up $2.16 to $10.76.</TE>
<TE>   * European markets rallied, including a 5.2% jump in Germany and a
3.8% rise in France.</TE>

<HD>News Corp. Could Win DirecTV</HD>
<DH>Merger: With the Hughes-EchoStar deal blocked, Murdoch
could get entry into the U.S. satellite market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>News Corp. may be the biggest beneficiary of a decision Thursday by
federal regulators to reject a proposed merger of the nation's only
two satellite providers, Hughes Electronics Corp. and EchoStar
Communications Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The media giant controlled by Rupert Murdoch negotiated with
Hughes' parent General Motors Corp. for more than a year before it
was trumped last October by a surprise 11th-hour bid for Hughes by
its smaller satellite rival, EchoStar.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with that deal rejected by the Federal Communications
Commission, Murdoch is expected to launch another bid for Hughes,
which owns the leading satellite provider DirecTV. News Corp. may be
able to snatch it up at a much cheaper price than a year ago, filling
a U.S. gap in the company's global satellite business.</LD>
<TE>   DirecTV executives, eager to spark a bidding war that would bring
a higher price, say the financial improvements at their company over
the last year will give them alternatives other than selling out to
News Corp. if the deal collapses. But industry executives and
analysts say GM is under pressure to act swiftly.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect Hughes to come back on the block by midyear, and for
Murdoch to get it in a heart beat," said Jimmy Schaeffler, an analyst
with Carmel Group, which tracks the satellite business. "GM still
needs the money and must be much more expedient and efficient this
time around."</TE>
<TE>   They say the automaker still needs the cash from a satellite sale
to fund its pension liabilities and may not be able to wait for a
stock market rebound to spin off its controlling 30% stake in Hughes
to public shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   GM and Hughes shareholders also are losing patience as the
satellite subsidiary's value has dropped sharply as the merger
process has dragged on. Since GM first hired investment bankers in
September 2000 to explore a sale of Hughes, the value of the
satellite subsidiary has declined to about $10 billion, from $44
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Investors drove down the price of Hughes again Thursday because of
fading prospects of receiving the 20% premium offered by the proposed
EchoStar bid. Hughes shares closed at $8.15 on the New York Stock
Exchange, down 25 cents. Last October, when the deal with EchoStar
was struck, Hughes shares were trading at about $15.</TE>
<TE>   Any prospects for a bidding war are slim, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Few media companies other than News Corp. have the balance sheets
to pull off such a large transaction. General Electric Corp., the
owner of NBC, is considered to be one potential candidate, but has
been unwilling to make large media acquisitions that would dilute
shareholder value.</TE>
<TE>   Although some within Hughes have contemplated the possibility of a
management buyout, financial experts say raising money for such a
deal is unlikely in today's conservative lending environment.</TE>
<TE>   GM is unlikely to initiate discussions with any new buyers before
the merger agreement with EchoStar officially expires at the end of
January. Any talks before then could jeopardize a $600-million
break-up fee the agreement requires EchoStar to pay Hughes if the
deal doesn't go through. EchoStar also agreed to buy Hughes' PanAmSat
satellite firm for $2.7 billion if the deal busts.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect EchoStar to challenge the break-up penalties in
court, which could further delay any Hughes sale.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch played a role in undermining the merger by hiring
lobbyists to pressure Congress and state attorneys general to oppose
it as a monopoly. Over the last year, he also has amassed a cash war
chest to make another run for Hughes in anticipation of the EchoStar
deal collapsing.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent investor conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.,
he said the price and structure of any new bid would be different.</TE>
<TE>   After all, GM's 30% stake in Hughes, which trades as a tracking
stock, has sharply declined in value. It now is worth about $3
billion--half of what it was a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Wall Street sources say News Corp. may not need
partners. Its balance sheet now is healthier, with nearly $3 billion
in cash reserves. Murdoch sold Fox Family Worldwide to Walt Disney
Co. for $5.2 billion last year to raise money for the Hughes bid. The
company recently registered to sell off to the public an additional
$1.5 billion in equity in its Fox Entertainment Group subsidiary.</TE>

<HD>Order Blocking Paxil Ads Is Lifted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Los Angeles has rescinded an order for a temporary
injunction that would have barred British pharmaceutical giant
GlaxoSmithKline from running television ads for its Paxil
antidepressant that said the drug was not habit-forming.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer's decision Thursday was a
victory not only for GlaxoSmithKline but also for the Food and Drug
Administration, which had approved the ads. The FDA's authority as
the sole arbiter of accuracy and truth in direct-to-consumer
marketing had been challenged by the judge's original decision to
block the ads.</LD>
<LD>   "We are very gratified by the judge's decision," FDA spokesman
Brad Stone said.</LD>
<TE>   "We are pleased that the judge has reviewed additional scientific
evidence and the expert opinion presented by the FDA," said David
Stout, president of US Pharmaceuticals, GSK.</TE>
<TE>   "Experts including the FDA and leading physician and mental health
organizations agree that antidepressant medications like Paxil are
non-habit-forming."</TE>
<TE>   The injunction had never gone into effect because Pfaelzer had
issued a stay of her order pending further arguments and submissions
from the federal government on why Paxil, one of the world's
bestselling drugs, was not habit-forming.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it "strongly disagreed" with the judge's earlier
decision, GlaxoSmithKline voluntarily pulled the ads. The company is
now free to run them.</TE>
<TE>   The request for an injunction was part of a class-action lawsuit
filed in August 2001 on behalf of 35 former Paxil users from around
the nation, who said they suffered withdrawal symptoms such as
nausea, fever and electric zaps to their bodies. The suit was filed
in Los Angeles because many of the 35 plaintiffs are from Southern
California, as is the law firm that is handling the case.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' lawyers said Thursday that they were waiting to see
the judge's written opinion and were withholding comment until then.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department lawyers and the FDA had argued that it was a
mistake to say the presence of withdrawal symptoms meant the drug was
habit-forming. They said Paxil produced no craving for the drug in
its users.</TE>
<TE>   But psychiatrists differed broadly on the question, with some
saying they had patients who needed months to get over the drug and
others saying the withdrawals were relatively mild in all but a few
rare circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a no-brainer that Paxil is not habit-forming," said Marc
Graff, a psychiatrist and past president of the Southern California
Psychiatric Society.</TE>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline's shares rose 71 cents to $40.21 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Cargo Resumes Moving at Ports</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billions of dollars' worth of cargo that piled up at West Coast ports
during the 10-day shutdown began moving out across supply chains
Thursday--but not without glitches.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, representatives of the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Assn. employers group said
they expected negotiations with a federal mediator to resume next
week.</LD>
<LD>   As work at harbors from San Diego to Seattle resumed Thursday,
shipping companies and freight forwarders were scrambling to locate
empty truck trailers, which were in short supply because seagoing
containers were piled on them during the lockout.</LD>
<TE>   Railroads were hard pressed to handle the demand. Although most
containers move by truck, the rails have become a critical piece of
the containerized shipping supply chain. With goods undeliverable
during the lockout, rail carriers moved their equipment east, noted
Steve Stallone, a spokesman for the ILWU.</TE>
<TE>   Stallone said that in Oakland alone there are 36 ships in port,
each with hundreds of rail containers aboard. But railroad officials
are accepting only 180 containers a day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Union Pacific Railroad, one of the nation's leading carriers,
brought about 90 locomotives to Southern California in anticipation
of Wednesday's opening and expects to operate at least 30% more
trains than normal from the West Coast in the coming days, according
to spokesman Mike Furtney.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing we can do is tell everybody to stay calm and wait
for the situation to catch up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast's 29 ports opened Wednesday night after a federal
judge granted President Bush's request for a temporary injunction
under the Taft-Hartley Act, launching an 80-day cooling-off period
for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., representing shipping lines and
terminal operators, locked out the ILWU on Sept. 29, claiming the
union was engaging in disruptive work slowdowns to protest stalled
contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Maritime Assn. spokesman Steve Sugerman described the work
pace as sluggish Thursday, and said the group continues to monitor
the ILWU's activity to determine whether there are any orchestrated
slowdowns. The group is prepared to seek court sanctions against the
ILWU if it believes a slowdown is in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders, who have vowed to "work safe" in the wake of the
deaths of five ILWU members on the waterfront this year, say the slow
pace is a result of a backlog of containers and a shortage of
staffing and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Although containers were moving out, port and shipping executives
warned that the backlog of tennis shoes, computer parts, Halloween
decorations and other goods was so huge that it would take weeks
before the transpacific supply chain was back to normal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not unreasonable to expect that we're going to feel the
impact of this work stoppage for at least another six weeks," said
Robert Kleist, an advisor to Taiwan-based Evergreen.</TE>
<TE>   With each day of additional congestion, the bill for the port
closure mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Giant clothing retailer Gap Inc. on Thursday warned that its
fourth-quarter earnings could be 50% below expectations because of
the port closure. And the Los Angeles County Economic Development
Corp. estimated that the 10-day shutdown cost the U.S. economy at
least $5 billion, nearly half of that in California.</TE>
<TE>   Even with everyone working overtime to get ships on their way, it
will take weeks to work through the backlog because there are more
vessels at sea, said Dick McKenna, executive director of the Marine
Exchange at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   As the day began Thursday, hundreds of workers crowded into the
ILWU hiring hall in Wilmington and hundreds of trucks lined up across
the harbor at Pier 400, the largest shipping terminal in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Orcutt of Long Beach, a union mechanic, said he is concerned
about how the next several weeks will play out. Orcutt was in the
first group of workers allowed back into Pier 400. Upon entering, he
said, officials of the terminal company handed his group of mechanics
a list of more than 50 vehicles and cranes that needed repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "The shipping companies will have to understand that we are doing
the best job possible with what they have given us to work with," he
said. "We all want to do our job."</TE>
<TE>   Across the U.S., businesses wondered when their freight would be
delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Miranda Su, vice president of sales and marketing for Irvine-based
technology firm Iogear Inc., said she was desperate to get her firm's
containers of computer peripherals and networking equipment off a
ship in Long Beach. If she fails, clients such as Fry's Electronics
Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. will be caught without some of Iogear's most
popular products.</TE>
<TE>   One industry particularly hard hit by the port closure was the
import automakers. Gardena-based Nissan North America and
Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. are predicting U.S. sales
could drop by as much as 15% in October because of shortages of
popular vehicles they import from Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Motor Co. said Thursday that it will close three of its U.S.
manufacturing plants for an undetermined period because of parts
shortages that developed while the ports were closed.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers John O'Dell and Dan Weikel contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Power Exchange Execs' Pay at Issue</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Creditors question the millions given to
officers of the California nonprofit before Chapter 11 filing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top officers of the California Power Exchange paid themselves more
than $5 million in salary and other compensation in the weeks before
the electricity market's March 2001 bankruptcy filing, according to
court papers filed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The payments are raising questions among the electricity market's
creditors, which were some of the biggest sellers of power to the
state and were branded as gougers by Gov. Gray Davis for charging
high electricity prices during the state's energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Such market participants pay the continuing bills of the
out-of-business energy market, and now they are worried that they may
have been gouged by the Power Exchange, the Pasadena-based nonprofit
corporation created by California's landmark law launching the
state's ill-fated venture into electricity market competition in
1998.</LD>
<TE>   Power Exchange Chief Executive George Sladoje said Thursday that
he had not seen the creditor filing, but he added that all salaries,
benefits and severance payments were approved by the corporation's
governing board and were reviewed by the exchange's legal advisors.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you that every payment and every policy and plan for
payments were made with approval by the board," Sladoje said.</TE>
<TE>   The filing late Thursday by power-selling subsidiaries of
Houston-based Dynegy Inc., Atlanta-based Mirant Corp., Houston-based
Reliant Energy Inc. and San Diego-based Sempra Energy is careful to
draw no conclusions about the propriety of the large payments to
executives as the exchange was turning its own lights off in early
2001 because California's two largest electricity utilities were
running out of cash.</TE>
<TE>   The document details compensation to Sladoje of $1.9 million in
the 90 days before March 9, 2001, the day the exchange filed for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. By that time, the exchange's electricity market, which once
handled 90% of the power bought and sold in the state, had been
closed for more than a month. The court filing also reports
compensation of $628,000 in the 90-day period for Lynn Miller, the
exchange's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Both amounts represent the executives' normal annual compensation
to run the intricate marketplace, which once employed 200 people, and
to oversee the complex bankruptcy and the company's response to the
tangle of investigations into California's energy meltdown, Sladoje
said.</TE>
<TE>   The creditor filing also lists $2.6 million in payments to six
other top officers, most of whom left their jobs soon after the
bankruptcy filing. One officer, who was an employee for less than one
month after several months as an outside contractor, received
$372,000, according to the filing.</TE>
<TE>   The expenditures were a varying mixture of salary, incentive
bonuses, retention payments and accelerated payment of retirement
benefits, the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   "In sum, the once-orderly [Power Exchange] compensation process
broke down in the months before bankruptcy. Policies were adopted or
adjusted without board oversight; plan documents were interpreted to
maximize the money officers could pay themselves and other employees;
and the officers made advances to themselves," the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   The filing, made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles, was
designed to call attention to the payments, which the creditors
discovered through an independent investigation, according to the
document. Any further review or action would have to come from the
Bankruptcy Court, the U.S. Trustee or a new nine-member board of
directors of the Power Exchange that is expected to be confirmed
soon, said lawyers familiar with the proceeding, who wished to remain
anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   "We avoided calling this a feeding frenzy," said one lawyer. "It
is unclear to us as to what payments were approved or not approved by
the [Power Exchange] board. But when it's clear that the company is
going out of business, it's pretty alarming" that such payments were
made.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading
Forum, whose members are Power Exchange creditors, said the filing
"raises questions of were these appropriate payments, who authorized
them and why were they made?"</TE>
<TE>   The exchange, which opened on March 31, 1998, was the cornerstone
of California's pioneering push into electricity deregulation. For
the first time, independent power sellers and the big power buyers
cut deals for electrons in a competitive market.</TE>
<TE>   But power prices soared in May 2000, creating huge debts for
Southern California Edison, the utility arm of Rosemead-based Edison
International, and PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. of San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The utilities were freed from the legal requirement late in 2000
that they must buy the bulk of their electricity from the Power
Exchange, guaranteeing extinction for the market.</TE>
<TE>   The exchange administers a trust fund of $1.4 billion, consisting
largely of funds from Edison, that eventually will be distributed to
creditors when the state's refund case is settled, Sladoje said.
PG&amp;E, which also is operating under bankruptcy protection, has not
yet contributed to the trust fund.</TE>
<TE>   Sladoje said the Power Exchange employs only 10 people full time.</TE>

<LD>Federal regulators Thursday approved a new technology for offering
digital radio service, one of the biggest upgrades in decades in
sound quality and choice of stations and a challenge to the growing
pay-satellite radio services.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission at its regular monthly open
meeting approved the technology for the digital radio service
developed by IBiquity Digital Corp., a privately held firm backed by
many of the biggest radio broadcasters.</LD>
<LD>   "The beauty of digital is it always has the potential to provide
better services for consumers with more efficient use of the
spectrum," said FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers eventually will have to buy new radios, which are not
expected to be on the market until next year, and stations will have
to upgrade their transmitting equipment at an average cost of about
$75,000, according to IBiquity.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the IBiquity technology will allow broadcasters a separate
stream within the existing spectrum they use to offer other services
and applications, such as weather or traffic data as well as news and
stock quotes.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the backers of IBiquity are Clear Channel Communications
Inc., with some 1,200 stations; Viacom Inc.'s Infinity Broadcasting,
with about 185 stations; and Walt Disney Co.'s ABC Radio network,
with about 230 affiliate stations.</TE>

<HD>Languid September Sales May Portend a Sluggish Holiday
Shopping Season</HD>
<DH>Retailing: Study of stores finds only 1.2% rise from last
year's level, which tumbled because of the terrorist attacks. Dock
lockout adds to the pain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warm weather, the weak stock market and concern over a possible war
with Iraq kept many would-be shoppers out of stores in September,
another warning sign that this year's holiday gift-buying season may
not be merry for retailers or the U.S. economy, analysts and
merchants said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Retail sales in stores open at least a year rose a scant 1.2% in
September from a year earlier, according to Goldman Sachs' retail
composite index.</LD>
<LD>   The poor showing was especially troubling to economists, many of
whom expected sales to look strong compared with the sharp drop-off
in the weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Sales in September
2001 were flat.</LD>
<TE>   "This paints a very pessimistic outlook for holiday shopping,"
said Michael Niemira, senior economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in
New York. "If we see another drop in consumption in the overall
economy, my view is that it would be a new recession."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to many retailers' woes is the tangle at West Coast ports,
which threatens some holiday sales because of delays in getting key
merchandise such as apparel, toys and housewares delivered to stores.</TE>
<TE>   Although the offloading of ships has resumed after nearly two
weeks of disruption, the backlog of containers already on the docks
and on ships still moored off the coast could mean that some
merchandise is several weeks away from getting to store shelves.</TE>
<TE>   Gap Inc., which posted its 29th straight month of declining
same-store sales, said merchandise delays caused by the lockout at
the ports could cut the San Francisco-based company's fourth-quarter
earnings by half. The parent company of Gap, Banana Republic and Old
Navy stores said a quarter of its holiday merchandise was sitting in
containers waiting to be offloaded.</TE>
<TE>   Gap's same-store sales fell 2% last month, slightly better than
some on Wall Street expected. Its stock rose 12 cents to $9.42 on
Thursday in New York Stock Exchange trading. The Standard &amp; Poor's
index of 87 retail stocks rose 1.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, are a
key measure of a retailer's health. The figure excludes sales from
new and closed stores, which can skew results.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were troubled by September's sales tally because of the
nearly across-the-board weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Discount stores, which have routinely out-performed the rest of
the sector, again fared better than department and specialty stores</TE>
<TE>   Costco Wholesale Corp. was among the discount leaders, posting a
5% same-store sales gain.</TE>
<TE>   But Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer and usually
a performance leader, pulled out a 3.3% same-store sales gain to hit
the lower end of its plan--only after revising its numbers downward
midway through the month.</TE>
<TE>   Target Corp. reported a 0.8% decline in same-store sales, and
Kohl's Corp., a hybrid discount and department store adored by
investors and shoppers, suffered its worst month in at least five
years, with same-store sales falling 3.2%. Kohl's shares fell $5, or
9.2%, to $49.45 on the NYSE. Kohl's is rolling out the first of about
30 stores in California early next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the high and mighty fell," said Todd Slater, an analyst with
Lazard in New York. "It was a very depressing month."</TE>
<TE>   In the department-store sector, Federated Department Stores Inc.,
May Department Stores Co., J.C. Penney Co. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
reported sales that were flat to 3.1% lower than a year earlier. One
exception was Fresno-based Gottschalks Inc., which has 13 Southern
California stores. It reported a 1.4% gain.</TE>
<TE>   California-based specialty merchants such as Hot Topic Inc. and
Pacific Sunwear Inc. posted above-average gains, while Wet Seal Inc.
said sales plunged 7.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Higher-end chains were a bright spot in Thursday's numbers, with
Sharper Image Corp., Saks Inc. and Neiman Marcus Group Inc. posting
strong gains.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason Slater isn't ready to write off the holiday
season.</TE>
<TE>   "September is not a proxy for Christmas," Slater said. "I think
it's a proxy for how weak the consumer is, but I don't think at the
end of the day consumers are going to ignore Christmas, which could
be better than people think."</TE>

<LD>   Vivendi Universal plans to slash by a half its corporate staff in
Paris and New York in the next year, saving more than $138 million in
costs.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi will cut 152 jobs at its Paris headquarters and 100 jobs
from the company's New York office, which is moving from Park Avenue
to an less expensive office a few blocks away on 3rd Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts come as Vivendi Universal is prolonging the auction of
its publishing business because bids have been so far below the
asking price, prompting speculation over whether the troubled media
giant will conclude a deal this year to lessen its debt.</TE>

<LD>   Verizon Communications Inc. received court approval to give
work-time credit to as many as 12,500 female workers who took
maternity or pregnancy leave, entitling them to millions of dollars
more in pension benefits, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
said.</LD>
<TE>   Verizon predecessors Nynex and Bell Atlantic were accused of
violating federal law by not counting time on pregnancy and maternity
leave toward a worker's pension from 1965 to 1979, and on child-care
leave until 1983.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest U.S. local-telephone company agreed to give the credit
to workers in 13 Eastern states and the District of Columbia.</TE>

anti-virus software, reported better-than-expected profit growth for
the third quarter, sending its shares up 25%.</LD>
<TE>   Network Associates also said it cut 100 jobs and would shift
one-third of the nearly 600 workers at its Santa Clara, Calif.,
headquarters to a facility near Dallas to reduce costs.</TE>
<TE>   Net income was $9.1 million, or 6 cents a share, contrasted with a
net loss of $11.3 million, or 8 cents, in the same period a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The results include $24.8 million in charges related to the
purchase last month of the remaining 25% of McAfee.com that it didn't
already own. Excluding the charges, net income would have been $27
million, or 15 cents a share, 3 cents higher than estimates. Revenue
increased 13% to $232.2 million.</TE>

transmission, saving millions of dollars in costs.</LD>
<TE>   GM already sells some truck transmissions to Ford for use in its
medium-duty pickup trucks, and the world's two largest automakers
have cooperated in other areas before. But they never have
co-developed key vehicle parts. Such cooperation is more common
across borders between the U.S., Asian and European automakers.</TE>

<HD>USAI to Buy Rest of Ticketmaster Shares</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a step toward uniting the various electronic commerce companies
controlled by USA Interactive, Chairman Barry Diller announced
Thursday that the company will purchase the shares of Ticketmaster it
does not already own.</LD>
<LD>   But the $730-million deal falls far short of accomplishing
Diller's goals.</LD>
<LD>   USAI also announced it is ending efforts to buy the outstanding
shares of its two other publicly traded subsidiaries, Expedia Inc.
and Hotels.com, after the boards of those companies dismissed USAI's
overtures.</LD>
<TE>   Though bringing Ticketmaster within USAI is a welcome event, Vice
Chairman Victor Kaufman said he was disappointed that USAI could not
close similar deals with the other two firms it controls but does not
wholly own.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed the independent directors who represent the minority
shareholders to agree to the proposal and we never were able to get
the energy level" to that point, Kaufman said.</TE>
<TE>   Expedia and Hotels.com remained independent, C.E. Unterberg,
Towbin analyst Bailey Dalton said, because their shares are
appreciating faster than USAI's.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, "Ticketmaster is a more mature company with less
growth potential," Dalton said, noting that those shareholders had
more to gain from the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The noncash deal values shares in the Los Angeles-based company's
ticket, dating service and city listings businesses at $15.17.</TE>
<TE>   Ticketmaster's shareholders will receive 0.935 share of USAI
common stock for each Ticketmaster common stock they own, a 20%
premium on the 20-day average ratio of Ticketmaster to USAI stock
prices leading up to the initial June 3 offer.</TE>
<TE>   That's an improvement over USAI's initial offer of $4.5 billion,
which represented a 7.5% premium. USAI holds a 66.5% equity stake in
Ticketmaster and subsidiaries Match.com and Citysearch.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's trading, Ticketmaster shares rose $3.35, or 26.6%,
to $15.95, USAI climbed $1, or 6.2%, to $17.22, Hotels.com rose
$5.19, or 12.2%, to $47.85, and Expedia gained $3.76, or 9.5%, to
$43.43, all on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the setback, Diller told analysts Thursday that "there was
no chance" USA would divest its interests in Hotels.com or Expedia
and that online travel would continue to be an important area for the
company.</TE>

<HD>2 Former WorldCom Managers Plead Guilty</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Middle-level execs agree to cooperate with
government's probe of alleged fraud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two former WorldCom Inc. middle-level managers pleaded guilty
Thursday to securities fraud, becoming the third and fourth
executives to implicate superiors and help in the government's probe
of alleged accounting fraud at the telephone giant.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom, the No. 2 U.S. long-distance telephone carrier and one
of the world's leading movers of Internet traffic, filed for
bankruptcy protection in July.</LD>
<LD>   Betty Vinson, 47, and Troy Normand, 35, both of Madison, Miss.,
pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud in federal court in Manhattan.
Their plea deals include an agreement to cooperate with prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Both defendants are certified public accountants who worked in
WorldCom's general accounting department and assisted in the
preparation of financial documents.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
related civil case against Vinson and Normand.</TE>
<TE>   Although the two were middle-level managers, their information is
expected to help prosecutors build a case against WorldCom's former
chief financial officer, Scott D. Sullivan, who was indicted on fraud
and conspiracy charges. He pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors previously said the investigation is continuing and
others could be charged in the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Both Normand and Vinson said during their plea hearings that they
were ordered to falsify WorldCom financial records by their
supervisors in order to inflate WorldCom earnings to meet Wall
Street's expectations and mislead the investing public.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi lawyer Joseph Hollomon, who represents both
defendants, told reporters after the hearings that his clients had
voiced their concerns to their superiors.</TE>
<TE>   Both Vinson and Normand were supervised by Buford Yates,
WorldCom's former director of general accounting. On Monday, Yates
pleaded guilty to two securities fraud charges and said he had been
ordered by his supervisors to falsify financial records.</TE>
<TE>   Yates reported to David Myers, former WorldCom controller. Myers
reported to Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Vinson and Normand carry a total possible
maximum prison term of 15 years, but they are expected to receive
lighter sentences because of their cooperation. Vinson is scheduled
to be sentenced Jan. 13 and Normand April 10.</TE>

<HD>L.A. a Contender to Host Next Summer's X Games</HD>
<DH>Television: ESPN may announce its decision by the end of
the month. Events would be held in and around Staples Center,
boosting local firms.</DH>

<LD>Los Angeles is under consideration as the site for next year's X
Games, an ESPN spokesman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Games, invented nearly a decade ago by the sports network as
alternative programming for Generation Y, have quickly evolved into
the Olympics of action sports.</LD>
<LD>   They attract hundreds of athletes and hundreds of thousands of
spectators for events ranging from skateboarding to speed climbing.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles is competing with Miami to host the summer X Games in
2003 and 2004, said Josh Krulewitz, ESPN's director of media
relations.</TE>
<TE>   If Los Angeles gets the nod, the events will be held in and around
Staples Center, Krulewitz said.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN, owned by Walt Disney Co., hopes to announce its decision by
the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   This summer's X Games, held over five days in Philadelphia, drew
300 athletes, more than 220,000 spectators and pumped an estimated
$40 million into the local economy, according to ESPN and the city's
convention and visitors bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Although the economic impact is considerably less than the $125
million of a Super Bowl, it would be a welcome "piece of change" for
area hotels, restaurants and other tourist businesses struggling with
an economic slowdown, said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN hosted the first X Games in Rhode Island seven years ago, the
product of network brainstorming over how to woo younger viewers with
action sports on the new ESPN2 cable channel.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, events have been added, and dropped--street luge, for
example--and the Games have grown into a cultural happening,
marketing experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent Games featured 21 events in seven sports
categories: skateboarding; aggressive in-line skating; bike stunts;
moto-x; speed climbs up walls; downhill BMX bike racing; and wake
boarding, the only water competition. In keeping with its grass-roots
beginning, there is no admission fee.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of parents didn't think they were serious events," said
David Carter, a local sports marketing consultant who attended the
first X Games in 1995. "Over the course of the last decade, the
interest and exposure of extreme sports has grown faster than any
other sport, except for NASCAR." Carter, who also teaches a graduate
course on sports business at USC, said there is great interest in
action sports among his students. "They'll say, 'We talk about the
Olympics. Why don't we talk about the X Games?' "</TE>
<TE>   He said the message hasn't been lost on corporate sponsors, which
have flocked to the X Games and action sports in order to tap their
audience of high-spending pre-teens, teenagers and young adults.</TE>
<TE>   Among the X Games sponsors: Taco Bell, Mountain Dew, Levi, Saturn
and Activision.</TE>
<TE>   This year's X Games were viewed by more than 63 million people,
said Krulewitz, and the average age of viewers was 27. That compares
with 43 for viewers of ESPN professional football and 49 for
baseball, he said.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Reverses Lobbyist Policy</HD>
<DH>Law: Tony Rackauckas had allowed staff to use law
enforcement funds to buy food and alcohol for politicians. O.C.
supervisor urges him to reimburse taxpayers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER and JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas has canceled a new policy
that allowed his staff to use money earmarked for law enforcement
activities to buy food and alcohol for lobbyists and lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   The action, which Rackauckas outlined in a letter to Orange County
Chief Executive Officer Michael Schumacher, comes three months after
he created the rules in response to a grand jury report.</LD>
<LD>   That report criticized the district attorney for permitting the
practice even though it violated county rules.</LD>
<TE>   County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who had been critical of the
alcohol expenses, praised Rackauckas for his action but implored him
to reimburse the county for alcohol his employees purchased during
lobbying meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the D.A. finally got it right," Spitzer said. "He's
acknowledged he's going to comply with county policy, but he still
has an obligation to reimburse the county [for alcohol expenses].
That's an improper use of taxpayer funds."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Rackauckas issued a written statement saying the
district attorney would not comment for this article.</TE>
<TE>   In his memo to Schumacher, Rackauckas said his employees will now
act "in accordance with county policy," which prohibits employees
from billing the county for alcohol. The memo said lobbying expenses
will be billed to the office's general fund, not the special witness
fund.</TE>
<TE>   The spending became an issue for Rackauckas over the summer when
the Orange County Grand Jury issued a report that questioned the more
than $4,700 his chief investigator billed the county for food and
alcohol during meetings with lawmakers, lobbyists and others.</TE>
<TE>   The money came from a fund used for witness protection, meetings
with informants and expenses related to undercover investigations.
County supervisors allocated $90,000 for the fund in last year's
budget.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury noted that a 1994 office policy prohibited
employees from using the fund for anything other than law enforcement
expenses, such as witness protection and undercover operations.</TE>
<TE>   While the panel recommended that Rackauckas enforce the 1994
rules, he instead changed the policy to allow the fund to be used for
lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Schumacher and county counsel Benjamin de Mayo
had pressed Rackauckas for explanations about his policy for alcohol
purchases, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a violation of county policy. It's a clear rule and everyone
knows it," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher said he was satisfied with Rackauckas' actions.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney has told me in writing the way he plans to
handle the payment of costs for legislative activities. I have
confidence that's how he will proceed," Schumacher said.</TE>
<TE>   But the policy reversal was not enough to satisfy some of
Rackauckas' critics. Orange County government watchdog Bill Mitchell,
former chairman of the county's Common Cause chapter, said Rackauckas
should discipline those who violated the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the message for the public when this individual is allowed
to bend and break the rules?" Mitchell asked.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in California, district attorneys have similar funds but
do not allow the money to be used for lobbying. Instead, they use
county lobbyists or other funds.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury's June report accused Rackauckas of misusing public
resources, showing favoritism in cases involving political supporters
and in personnel decisions. The district attorney has denied any
wrongdoing.</TE>

<HD>Growth a Costly Ballot Issue</HD>
<DH>Development: Measures in Ventura, Santa Paula and Simi
Valley pit landowners and builders against activists in the first
major challenges to county's SOAR laws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Landowners and developers have poured $1.5 million into a trio of
Ventura County ballot measures that pit them against
environmentalists and citizen activists in the ongoing war over
suburban sprawl.</LD>
<LD>   In Ventura, Santa Paula and Simi Valley, development interests are
setting spending records on initiative campaigns that would define
the boundaries of growth in the three cities for decades to come.</LD>
<LD>   Family landowners who want to build 1,390 homes in the rugged
canyons and hillsides overlooking Ventura have spent the most--about
$905,300--since the beginning of the year, according to campaign
finance statements filed this week.</LD>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, an Arizona-based developer has spent about
$425,000 backing one of the initiatives in hopes of moving the city's
growth boundary to clear the way for up to 2,250 homes.</TE>
<TE>   And in Simi Valley, landowners and business boosters have shelled
out $167,000 fighting an initiative that would further restrict
growth just outside the city's boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the countywide slow-growth group Save Open Space and
Agricultural Resources has spent just $56,600 on all three campaigns
since the beginning of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The huge discrepancies illustrate the significance of the
measures, which are the first major challenges to the strict
growth-control measures passed by county voters in 1995, said Herb
Gooch, political science chairman at Cal Lutheran University.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be that the lesson for SOAR is, 'Watch out what you
accomplish lest you end up having to play in a game with higher
stakes,' " Gooch said. "One side has a very vested interest in a
narrow issue and has large financial resources."</TE>
<TE>   SOAR has raised about $125,000 since Jan. 1, largely from
individual contributions of $100 or less. Other citizen committees
that have joined the fight against Ventura's Measure A and Santa
Paula's Measure F have raised an additional $5,300, most of which was
spent on yard signs and postage.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Steve Bennett, SOAR's chief spokesman,
said it has been a daunting challenge to get the group's message out
as deep-pocketed companies have saturated local airwaves and swamped
mailboxes with campaign material.</TE>
<TE>   "It should alert the public that some people are going to make
some huge profits," Bennett said. "Knowing those motives may help you
to analyze the credibility of their argument."</TE>
<TE>   But critics say Bennett and his supporters have scared the public
with misleading information. As a result, initiative proponents have
to spend more money working to debunk the myths, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Something may be a complete lie, but it scares the uneducated
voter," said Greg Boyd, who is leading the effort to pass Measure F
in Santa Paula on behalf of Arizona-based Pinnacle Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to defend this at every step along the way so the voter
can make the right decision," Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Merryman, spokeswoman for the pro-Measure A campaign in
Ventura, said SOAR may be able to spend less because its message is
simple: No development.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Lloyd Properties, which has owned the hillside land for more
than 100 years, wants to donate 3,050 acres of it to the public as
open space, said Merryman. "It's important to the families, it's
important to the community and it's our only shot."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign statements, which cover spending through Sept. 30,
show that Ventura's Measure A and Santa Paula's Measure F are being
bankrolled totally by the landowners who would benefit from their
passage.</TE>
<TE>   Expenditures range from rent on campaign offices to high-priced
public relations consultants and pollsters.</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, the No on Measure B campaign has taken donations
from a variety of real estate interests, including $77,316 in service
contributions from Unocal Corp. and $15,000 from Greenpark Ranch,
LLC.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal, which owns a 2,400-acre parcel known as Alamos Canyon, has
proposed building a large industrial business park and 1,600 homes on
the land. Greenpark Ranch owns Runkle Canyon, where 550 homes are
proposed.</TE>
<TE>   If Measure B passes, the City Council could not approve any
development on either property without a vote of the public.</TE>
<TE>   SOAR's largest campaign donation was $5,000, which it received
from actor Larry Hagman, who lives in Ojai, and Ventura's Christopher
Albrecht, president of HBO Original Programming.</TE>
<TE>   The grass-roots group may be having an especially difficult time
raising money this campaign season because of a general lack of
political interest among many voters and a sagging economy, Gooch
said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state, he said, candidates and organizations that rely
on support from individuals are struggling to raise funds.</TE>
<TE>   That only widens the gap between what is being spent by developers
and other corporations.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual thing for Ventura County, Gooch said, is to see
developers so unabashed in their financing of an election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't seem to have any embarrassment about it," he said.
"They're going right for the jugular."</TE>

<HD>Council Expected to OK Bratton Today</HD>
<DH>Police: After a week of meetings, the nominee for chief
wins support from the majority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After days of behind-the-scenes questioning by Los Angeles City
Council members, police chief-nominee William Bratton--a career cop
credited with dramatically cutting the crime rate in New York
City--is expected today to receive the eight votes necessary to
confirm his selection as head of the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   Alex Padilla, president of the 15-member council, said he would
back Bratton and predicted that a majority of his colleagues would as
well.</LD>
<LD>   "As important of a decision that this was for the mayor, it is
also an important decision for us," Padilla said. "Mr. Bratton has an
unmatched resume in the world to take on this job. I'm confident he
will do a good job. He has earned my support."</LD>
<TE>   At Mayor James K. Hahn's request, Bratton began meetings with
council members last Friday. Since then, council members have taken
the Boston native on tour after tour of their districts, introducing
him to Los Angeles even as they questioned him about his policing
philosophy and plans for the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, Bratton good-naturedly listened to
Councilman Tom LaBonge's soliloquies about the virtues of Los
Angeles. Bratton and his wife dined with Councilman Eric Garcetti and
his fiancee at the Pig 'n Whistle on Hollywood Boulevard. (Bratton
ordered French fries with his cheese pizza.) And the chief-in-waiting
spent hours inside Dennis Zine's City Hall office, its shelves filled
with police memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Zine, a longtime LAPD officer and Police Protective League
official, said he and Bratton bonded, "cop to cop."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of his meetings with the council members, Bratton--who
turned 55 Sunday--had won over many skeptical city lawmakers with his
pledges to revamp the LAPD's efforts to manage its officers and to
cut crime by importing some of the programs that worked in New York
City.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden, a staunch supporter of former Chief
Bernard C. Parks, is the only member of the council who refused to
meet with the nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bratton is still expected to get a long grilling from
council members in open session today, most of the 15 lawmakers have
indicated that they will give Bratton the thumbs-up to start work
Oct. 28.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very pleasantly surprised from our meeting," said Garcetti,
who was initially among the council members encouraging Hahn to give
the job to Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, a veteran of the LAPD. "I
think Bill Bratton is going to be a real change agent. He's very open
to broad-based policing with community partners. I'm pretty psyched.
It's going to be good."</TE>
<TE>   Zine, another Lopez supporter, said he, too, had been won over by
Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   "He had all the right answers to all the tough questions," said
Zine, who met with Bratton on Monday evening. "I'm going to vote
affirmative. I'm not impressed just because he tells a story, but
when I go beneath the surface on law and order issues, he has great
answers. I feel comfortable that he can handle the job."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Garcetti, Zine and Padilla, other council members
who say they support Bratton are Cindy Miscikowski, Jack Weiss, Wendy
Greuel, Ruth Galanter, Janice Hahn, Hal Bernson and LaBonge.</TE>
<TE>   "I was impressed with his background and his personality," Bernson
said. "He understood that he wasn't my first choice. I felt it should
have been someone who came up through the ranks of the department.
But I told him I would support him. It's a foregone conclusion
anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Council members who said in interviews that they were undecided on
Bratton's candidacy are Nick Pacheco and Ed Reyes, who both supported
Lopez for the job, and Jan Perry and Mark Ridley-Thomas, who were
strong backers of former Chief Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "There is reason to be impressed, and there is reason to be
concerned," Ridley-Thomas said. "He really does have to learn the
city and the department."</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said he plans to ask Bratton to give a timeline on how
quickly he can reduce crime in the city. "I want specifics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, city officials say they expect Holden to vote against
Bratton's confirmation. Holden, who sharply criticized Hahn's
decision to oppose Parks' reappointment, declined to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton was chosen for the position after a nationwide search
attracted 51 applicants. The Police Commission--which voted in April
to deny Parks a second five-year term--eventually winnowed the list
to three finalists and sent the names to Hahn for the final pick.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn announced Oct. 3 that Bratton was his choice for the job.
Also up for the position were Lopez, who spent the bulk of his career
in the LAPD, and former Philadelphia Police Commissioner John
Timoney, who was second in command under Bratton at the NYPD.</TE>

<HD>3 Condors Are Released in Mexico</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in a generation, California condors are flying
free over Mexico after three of the giant birds were released
Thursday in a mountainous region of Baja California.</LD>
<LD>   It took two days for the trio to leave their flight pen and soar
above the pine forests of the Sierra San Pedro de Martir National
Park.</LD>
<LD>   Two other condors, North America's largest birds, will be freed in
the next few weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a biological and symbolic significance here," said Mike
Wallace, who heads the San Diego-based condor recovery team. "These
birds haven't been seen in this area since the 1930s, when they were
lost to shooting and poisoning."</TE>
<TE>   The park rises from 6,000 to 9,000 feet and is covered in
old-growth pine, fir, hemlock and spruce forests. Summers are hot,
and winters are snowy and cold, unlike most of the other condor
habitats.</TE>
<TE>   Condors have now been successfully released in Los Padres National
Forest, Big Sur, the Grand Canyon and Baja California.</TE>
<TE>   "Although condors were common in the first half of the last
century, these magnificent birds are unknown to the younger
generation," said Horacio de la Cueva, who helps run the Baja condor
project. "Our education plans aim to teach both about the biology of
this bird and the global importance of environmental conservation in
Baja California."</TE>
<TE>   The condors, hatched from eggs at the Los Angeles Zoo and the
World Center for Birds of Prey in Boise, Idaho, have been in a flight
pen since August. Wallace released just three of the five condors
initially to let them adjust and ensure a smooth transition to the
wild.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be far easier to manage three inexperienced birds than
the whole group," he said. "Once they have a routine, they can teach
the last two condors where to roost and how to find the food we place
out."</TE>
<TE>   Condors are fed frozen calf carcasses to keep them from foraging
and getting poisoned by lead or other pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   There are now 73 condors in the wild and 129 in captivity. The
goal is to establish two populations of 150 birds each in California
and Arizona with 15 breeding pairs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a necropsy performed on a condor chick found dead in
Los Padres National Forest near Fillmore last week continues.
Pathologists at the San Diego Zoo say the level of decay has made
finding the cause of death difficult, if not impossible.</TE>
<TE>   They said the 5-month-old bird had good stores of fat, no broken
bones and no metal in its gastrointestinal tract.</TE>

<HD>Film Agency Audit Urged</HD>
<DH>Report: As part of overhaul, city attorney also calls for
removal of elected officials from the board of the troubled nonprofit
corporation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles city attorney's office called Thursday for an
overhaul of the beleaguered Entertainment Industry Development Corp.,
saying city officials failed to "properly monitor and audit" the film
permit agency, which is now under investigation by the district
attorney's office for possible misuse of public funds.</LD>
<LD>   In a 17-page report to the City Council, City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo proposed a city audit of the nonprofit corporation's
finances and the removal of all elected officials from its board of
directors.</LD>
<LD>   He also said the EIDC board should consider limiting agency
President Cody Cluff's responsibilities and suspending reimbursement
of expenses for officers until it can be determined whether public
funds were misspent.</LD>
<TE>   "It's clear no one was minding the store," Delgadillo said in an
interview. "The failure to have oversight and the actions of the CEO
[Cody Cluff] muddied the waters over whether money was spent
properly."</TE>
<TE>   The film agency is under investigation by the district attorney's
office to determine whether it improperly spent public funds on
lavish expenses and political contributions to elected officials on
its board.</TE>
<TE>   EIDC officials have argued that the agency is private and
therefore can make political contributions and have entertainment
expenses not acceptable in the public sector. The district attorney's
office, citing a state Fair Political Practices Commission advisory
letter, has said the agency may be a public entity prohibited from
making election contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said his review of the agency concluded that it was
intended to be a private con- tractor expediting film permits for the
city. He said the removal of elected officials from the board will
help clarify that the EIDC is a private corporation that will be held
accountable by the city through a contract with regular audits.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to take government out of the EIDC and remove the
politicians from the board," Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the EIDC board's
executive committee, said Thursday that he had not seen the city
attorney's report yet. He said he agreed with the concept of elected
officials no longer serving on the board. But he added that it is too
early for such a move.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, I do believe that has to happen," Yaroslavsky said.
"But right now, I think the executive committee has an immediate
responsibility to determine what's going on [with EIDC] and right
this ship, and I don't think it can wait for weeks or months to
renegotiate a contract."</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said confusing and ambiguous rules, the management of
Cluff, the involvement of elected city and county officials on the
agency's board, and the city's "failure to properly monitor and audit
EIDC has blurred the line between public and private."</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo recommended that the mayor and the members of the Los
Angeles City Council and the county Board of Supervisors be removed
from the EIDC board to help reduce confusion over whether it is a
private or public agency.</TE>
<TE>   He said that "only an audit can definitively determine if EIDC
inappropriately used any public funds, and thus we recommend this
audit begin immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney also called for the city to renegotiate the
terms of its contract with the agency to clarify and limit its role.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo's recommendations were endorsed Thursday by several
elected officials, including City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, who
heads the council's audit committee.</TE>
<TE>   "I am in complete agreement with the recommendations in his
report," said Greuel, who had, before her election, served on the
film agency's board as an executive with DreamWorks SKG.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure we reform and clean up those things that are
problematic. Major changes are needed," Greuel added, promising to
take Delgadillo's recommendations to the EIDC board for adoption.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Michael Antonovich said he wants to see a report
now being prepared for the EIDC board by former City Administrative
Officer Keith Comrie on reforms before committing to proposals by
Delgadillo.</TE>
<TE>   "The city attorney's recommendations and the City Council's
recommendations are premature until Keith Comrie's report comes
back," Antonovich said.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich endorsed the concept of developing a protocol for more
oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "It is essential to have an EIDC that has the integrity and
support of the public and private sector. Having appointed members
from the private sector ... makes more sense."</TE>
<TE>   Cluff said Thursday evening that he had not seen the report, but
"we're pleased to know that the city attorney agrees with us on the
fundamental issue that the EIDC is a private corporation. We look
forward to working through the rest of the issues with the city and
county on a reasoned basis."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of whether the EIDC is a private or public agency could
be crucial to whether its executives face criminal prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said it is clear that when the city and county set up
the agency in 1995 it was intended to be a private, nonprofit
corporation that would contract with the two government jurisdictions
to expedite film permits.</TE>
<TE>   He said one city document called it a "quasi-public agency," but
said the overwhelming majority of city records suggest the city
intended for it to be an "independent, nongovernmental" agency.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo disputed a state Fair Political Practices Commission
opinion that indicated EIDC was a public agency, saying it passes
through funds meant for the government and keeps fees from production
companies for expediting their permits.</TE>
<TE>   "We disagree with the FPPC's conclusion and find that the facts
indicate that the city is not the primary source of funds to EIDC,"
Delgadillo wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Steve Berry, Anita M. Busch and Ted Rohrlich
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Angels Staff Is Rushing to Put Team's House in Order by
Tonight</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Team, stadium staffs have countless tasks to
complete before the crowds arrive at Edison Field for Game 3 of the
league championship series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consider planning Major League Baseball's version of a wedding for
45,000 guests. Throw in a dose of uncertainty, the usual first-time
jitters and figure the whole event will be documented by about 600
journalists and viewed by millions across the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Don't forget decorations, fireworks, entertainment and food. These
are just some of the details that staff of the Anaheim Angels and
Edison International Field are rushing to complete before the
American League Championship Series against the Minnesota Twins
resumes tonight with the first of three games in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   "We're absolutely ramped up," said Robert Alvarado, the Angels'
marketing and promotions director. "We're working a mile a minute to
get things done."</LD>
<TE>   Alvarado is trying to arm every fan with a pair of inflatable, red
plastic ThunderStix to slap together. That would be easy if the
Angels had a warehouse full of the noisemakers. But these were
ordered only after the Angels upset the Yankees, and the ThunderStix
are coming from China--a distinct problem considering the 10-day
lockout at the Los Angeles-Long Beach ports that has had cargo backed
up for days.</TE>
<TE>   "You've heard of the slow boat from China?" Alvarado said. "We
didn't want to risk it. Our vendor is actually hand-delivering them.
He's getting on a freight plane, flying into LAX, coming straight
here on Friday. We're barely going to make our window."</TE>
<TE>   Those are just the freebies. Tim Fisk, general manager of Facility
Merchandising Inc. can barely keep the team store stocked. He even
had to have a new service counter built to accommodate more cash
registers.</TE>
<TE>   "As fast as they unload the stuff, we're delivering it up to the
[store] door," Fisk said.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the stadium, workers are whizzing through the halls in golf
carts, talking into walkie-talkies. Beepers buzz, cell phones ring.</TE>
<TE>   A casual observer might not notice the changes, but there are
many. Red, white and blue bunting circles the stands. The tops of the
dugouts have been painted, then repainted--first to say "American
League Division Series," then updated to read "American League
Championship Series." Six plate glass windows at the stadium's
entrance now have murals of Angel players.</TE>
<TE>   Groundskeepers are mowing fresh patterns and carefully imprinting
a big "A" into the grass. The pattern is created by rolling the grass
in one direction, like running your hand across carpet, head
groundskeeper Barney Lopas said.</TE>
<TE>   Construction crews still are building additional press boxes and
installing hundreds of telephone lines for the media. A typical game
must accommodate about 100 journalists. For this series, the Angels
are expecting about 600 print, TV and radio representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment manager Peter Bull is finishing the script for the
announcers and the pre-game show. Major League Baseball has issued a
few new guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Inning breaks, for example, are longer to allow for commercials
and special features on FOX. Upcoming batters must be announced two
minutes after the last out of the previous half inning. An umpire
will be standing by with a stopwatch.</TE>
<TE>   Some gimmicks from the regular season are gone. No more T-shirts
catapulted into the audience or trivia contests. Now Bull and his
staff are busy lining up national anthem singers and arranging
military flyovers with the Department of the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the food. Extra hot dogs, popcorn and cotton candy
aside, chef Marco Zapien must prepare a special menu for the Diamond
Club, an upscale restaurant inside the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   His shopping list included 100 pounds of quail, 110 pounds of
fish, 200 pounds of shrimp and 160 pounds of carved items including
veal and beef. During the games against the Twins, the Diamond Club
will have a special seafood station, besides the regular carving
counter and pasta bar.</TE>
<TE>   "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy," Zapien said about life at the
stadium the past couple weeks. Zapien also is preparing food for
postgame parties, which are held at the stadium for three hours after
every playoff game. One will have a Rally Monkey theme, complete with
Bananas Foster and steel drum music. Red Hot Angels night will
feature salsa music and Mexican food.</TE>
<TE>   "It's for the Angels, the visiting teams, Major League Baseball,
the other ballclubs that are sending a rep out here, media, our
sponsors, the city of Anaheim folks," said Jenny Price, party planner
and human resources manager. "You want it to be spectacular."</TE>
<TE>   Three games. Three parties for about 750 people. Three themes.
That's not counting the gala if the Angels reach the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really busy and we're pulling our hair out, but it's a
really fun kind of busy," Price said. "We'd rather be doing this than
standing on the sidelines watching some other team."</TE>

<HD>USC Benefactor Sues Over Gift</HD>
<DH>Academia: He says the school is defying his wishes and
wants it to give up the money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After watching his beloved grandfather succumb to cancer more than 50
years ago, Paul F. Glenn promised himself that if he ever became
wealthy, he would donate generously to medical research.</LD>
<LD>   Glenn, now 71 and head of a venture capital firm in Santa Barbara,
went on to earn a fortune as a commodities speculator. And, true to
his pledge, he gave USC $1.6 million in the mid-1990s to promote
medical research on aging.</LD>
<LD>   But that touching story hasn't had a fairy-tale ending.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, it has turned into a nasty lawsuit, with Glenn saying
that USC is defying his wishes, concealing how it is using his money
and hurting his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   The legal skirmish sheds light on the conflicts, usually
behind-the-scenes, that occasionally arise between universities and
disenchanted donors. It also puts a spotlight on Glenn, a Harvard Law
School graduate and health buff who has filed at least a half dozen
unrelated lawsuits around the country over the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   University officials, citing a standing policy, will not comment
on the pending litigation, except to say that USC and Edward L.
Schneider, dean of the school's Andrus Gerontology Center,
"vigorously dispute" Glenn's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn, who tries to keep himself healthy by taking 30 nutritional
supplements each morning and evening, said the aim of his donation to
USC was in keeping with the stated mission of his 37-year-old Glenn
Foundation for Medical Research. That is "to extend the healthy
productive years of life through research on the mechanisms of
biological aging."</TE>
<TE>   According to Glenn, USC initially appeared to be living up to its
end of the bargain. As Glenn stipulated, a young outside researcher
investigating the biology of aging soon was hired for the Paul F.
Glenn Foundation Chair in Cellular and Molecular Gerontology. It was
to be a rotating three-year position.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn said his aim was to propel the careers of promising young
biomedical researchers who otherwise wouldn't have support.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, however, Glenn said he learned that the first two
professors appointed to the endowed position were not given the
income from his $1.6-million endowment to cover their research
expenses. He called that a "great mystery" that remains unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   The first holder of the chair, Pamela Larsen, confirmed that she
never received income from the endowment. Larsen, now a research
chemist at UCLA, said she left USC in 1999 over that issue and other
problems.</TE>
<TE>   But Julie K. Andersen, who was the second person to hold the Glenn
chair, said she was "well-supported" and that she believed her
funding came from the Glenn endowment.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn said he was surprised he could not get an explanation from
Schneider, whom he had known for years and who he says pursued him
for the donation.</TE>
<TE>   "I never dreamed of him double-crossing me, and I don't know why
he did it," Glenn said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Glenn said, the current holder of the chair, Valter D.
Longo, was named even though Glenn objected because Longo already was
on the USC faculty.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked to us like a backdoor way of just using our funds to
hype the budgets of people already on the faculty, and that's not
what was intended," Glenn said.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn likened his situation to an ongoing legal flap at Princeton,
where he earned his undergraduate degree in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   Princeton is being sued by relatives of a couple who in the 1960s
set up a foundation to fund the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
International Affairs. They accuse the university of mishandling the
foundation's nearly $600 million in assets.</TE>
<TE>   "The larger issue is that the intent of the donor in the long run
becomes eclipsed in favor of the political purposes at the
university," Glenn said.</TE>
<TE>   Princeton spokeswoman Lauren Robinson-Brown said the university
believes the funds have been managed properly.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon E. Steinbach, general counsel for the American Council on
Education, said such legal action remains rare but that donor suits
and threatened suits appear to have increased slightly in recent
years. He attributes that to the country's growing litigiousness in
general.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach said universities try to resolve disputes quietly to
avoid controversies that could alienate other potential donors. "It's
unusual when they reach the public arena," Steinbach said.</TE>
<TE>   One way of doing that is to simply return a donor's money.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Yale University did just that in 1995. It returned a
$20-million donation from Lee Bass, apparently because the Texas
businessman wanted veto authority over faculty members who would
teach the new Western civilization courses that his money was
intended to fund.</TE>
<TE>   Although Glenn's has become a public squabble, the financial
stakes are modest by the standards of a school like USC. The
university has received four donations of about $100 million each
over the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   The suit is by no means Glenn's first foray into the courtroom.
Court records in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Arizona, Pennsylvania
and Illinois show Glenn as a plaintiff in several recent lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn says his suits are attempts to collect debts and recoup
losses from former business partners and commodities brokers who have
cheated him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been too trusting," Glenn said. "If I liked the cut of a
guy's jib, and he had an idea that sounded reasonable, I would back
him. Why do they steal the money? Because they can. They're looking
for people who trust them."</TE>
<TE>   Some targets of Glenn's lawsuits, however, describe him as
mercurial and quick to litigate. Robert R. Horton, chairman and chief
executive of Alchemix Corp., an Arizona company specializing in
low-polluting energy technologies, said he was sued by Glenn after a
$40-million clean-coal venture in Pennsylvania failed. The case is
scheduled to go to trial next month.</TE>
<TE>   "If things don't work out as well as they might, he becomes
litigious," Horton said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that our experience was that we saw him as an angel
in our venture and when we were unable to make it work, we found that
[he] wasn't all angelic."</TE>
<TE>   Glenn said the coal venture with Horton turned out to be "a clear
case of fraud."</TE>
<TE>   One of Glenn's oldest friends, Daniel L. Ritchie, chancellor of
the University of Denver, called him a philanthropist with exacting
standards. "He doesn't throw money away," said Ritchie, who noted
that his university has not received any donations from Glenn and
that he doesn't anticipate any.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very scrupulously honest person who expects the same of
other folks," added Ritchie, who used Glenn as his commodities broker
in the late 1950s. "When they don't live up to that, he probably
feels that he has an obligation to do his part to encourage them to
do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   No trial date has been set for Glenn's case against USC, which, in
addition to seeking damages, seeks to force the university to
transfer the donation to another research institution.</TE>
<TE>   For now, researchers involved remain undeterred. Longo, the
current holder of the Glenn chair and an assistant professor at USC,
said university officials "haven't told me anything" about the
dispute other than that a lawsuit was filed. Longo led a research
team that discovered how the chief molecular villain of Alzheimer's
disease kills nerve cells, and it identified two drugs that combat
the process.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks to the Glenn Foundation, we've published some important
research," Longo said.</TE>

<PH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Simon Offers Snafu 'Regret'</HD>
<DH>Politics: The candidate calls his mistaken claim that the
governor broke the law a 'sorry episode.' A Davis aide asks, 'Where's
the apology?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. expressed regret
Thursday for accusing Gov. Gray Davis of illegally accepting a
political donation, calling the matter a "sorry episode" that has
distracted voters from the important issues of the race.</LD>
<LD>   "I find it necessary to express to everyone my sincere regret for
the way this matter was handled," the GOP candidate said during a
speech to Town Hall Los Angeles at a downtown hotel.</LD>
<LD>   "Now, many of you may have seen my latest commercial, where I say
I'm not perfect, and that's indeed true," he added. "Now we know, of
course, my campaign is not perfect."</LD>
<TE>   Simon's remarks were his first public acknowledgment that he erred
this week when he claimed that a photo showed Davis taking a $10,000
check from a police organization in his state office when he was
lieutenant governor. Accepting campaign donations in state offices is
a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   However, the photograph of Davis and the group's former executive
director, Alfred Angele, was actually taken at a private home in
Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate said he offered his regrets in the same spirit in
which he demanded an apology from Davis for attacking Simon's record
during Monday's gubernatorial debate. But Simon stopped short of
using the word "apology." And he maintained that he had never said
the photograph was taken in the lieutenant governor's office--even
though on Tuesday he had called the picture "proof" that the governor
violated the law.</TE>
<TE>   "I never said that picture was what other people said it was,"
Simon told reporters after his speech. When pressed on the matter, he
added: "To the extent to which I should have said 'purported,' I
accept that."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he was eager to move on to other matters, but the Davis
campaign said the issue was not settled.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the apology?" asked Davis campaign strategist Garry
South. "This man, a so-called former prosecutor, stood in public
before the state press corps and called the governor a criminal and
said he had evidence to prove it. He owes the governor an
apology--not an apology to the people, but to the person he defamed."</TE>
<TE>   The other man in the picture, Angele, held a news conference
Wednesday at the lavish house where the picture was taken in January
1998. Surrounded by television cameras in the foyer, the spot where
the photo was shot, Angele demanded letters of apology from both
Simon and the police organization for charging that he had given
Davis the check in the state capitol.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why somebody didn't pick up the phone and at
least call me and say, 'Where was this picture taken?' " Angele said.
Angele said he was particularly incensed by allegations that he broke
the law, because he is a Davis appointee to the Board of Prison
Terms, where he holds sway over the sentences of prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Angele's lawyer, Stephen Warren Solomon, told reporters the
house--then the home of developer Bruce Karatz--was "392 miles from
the lieutenant governor's office."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a defamatory act, accusing him of a crime," Solomon said.
"It was done with reckless disregard of the truth, and we are reviewing
now a potential defamation suit against all potential parties in this
matter."</TE>
<TE>   He said Angele would wait a few weeks for letters of apology
before deciding whether to sue. "Unlike Mr. Simon, we're not going to
jump and run," Solomon said.</TE>
<TE>   The episode, occurring with just weeks to go before the Nov. 5
election, has roiled Simon's already struggling campaign and
astonished many political strategists, who were dumbfounded at what
they termed a severe misstep.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Simon campaign strategist Ed Rollins acknowledged
that the incident had caused the businessman's candidacy serious
damage. "Some people in our campaign thought this was a silver
bullet," he told reporters. "I think it was a bullet. I think we put
it in the gun wrong. We shot ourselves in the head."</TE>
<TE>   Rollins actually went further than Simon on Thursday, offering his
apology to the candidate and the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "I apologize for being a part of something that accused him of
lawbreaking with no evidence," Rollins said. He added that the
campaign would continue to embrace the endorsement of the group that
supplied the picture: the California Organization of Police and
Sheriffs.</TE>
<TE>   During his Los Angeles speech, Simon said he had believed COPS
when its leadership told his campaign it had evidence of illegal
behavior by the governor. He said he believed it in part because
reporting the instance would also implicate the group, and he noted
that Davis's fund-raising practices have been questioned in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Simon spokesman Mark Miner, meantime, said any legal action by
Angele would be "nothing more than a frivolous lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   "The information was provided by COPS in a good-faith effort and
turned out to be inaccurate," Miner said. "We admitted our mistake,
and now we're moving on."</TE>
<TE>   Rollins, however, said the campaign is considering writing a
letter of apology to Angele.</TE>
<TE>   The incident, which has upset Republicans and demoralized Simon's
campaign staff, was initially seen as a way for the campaign to get
on the offensive. Low on money, Rollins said, the campaign had hoped
that the release of the photo would give Simon's candidacy a
much-needed bump.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been running on fumes," Rollins said. "When you're sitting
there with 4 or 5 million dollars ... and he's got 21 [million] left
and he's been hitting us with $30 million, we've got to do things
like this to stay in the game. We're in guerrilla warfare."</TE>
<TE>   Rollins said campaign officials didn't have an opportunity to
verify the photo before the police organization released it Tuesday,
but went forward with the charge because they were repeatedly assured
by members of the group that it was authentic.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not stupid," Rollins said, adding that the campaign asked
about the veracity of the picture scores of times. "In hindsight, we
look stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Simon was not aware that the police organization was going to
release the photograph until Saturday, when his advisors told him to
ask Davis during Monday's debate if he had ever taken political money
in a state office. Rollins said the candidate did not ask them if
they had vetted the picture.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we were so assured it was going to happen the way we laid
it out to be," he said, adding: "We made some assumptions that
obviously we shouldn't have."</TE>
<TE>   After enduring four days of often-hostile questioning about the
photo, Simon said he was eager to move on to other matters. He vowed
to spend the rest of the election talking about such issues as the
economy, education and the state's infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 26 days, I want to do my level best to raise the
dialogue in the campaign," he said.</TE>

<HD>KOCE-TV's Foundation Makes Bid to Buy Station</HD>
<DH>Media: Fund-raising group's takeover from college district
would maintain local control. FCC deadline for digital conversion
looms.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's public television station would remain locally owned
and controlled under a proposal by the station's fund-raising
foundation.</LD>
<LD>   The KOCE-TV Foundation has made a bid to acquire the license and
take over operations of the station from the Coast Community College
District and to fund KOCE's conversion to digital broadcasting,
foundation officials said Thursday. A price wasn't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The foundation has raised $4 million to pay for equipment so that
KOCE meets a Federal Communications Commission deadline for all
public television stations to switch from analog to digital
broadcasting by 2003.</LD>
<TE>   The cost of moving to digital technology prompted the college
district in May to solicit bids for a partner or buyer for the
station.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman University submitted a bid, but withdrew it recently.</TE>
<TE>   University President James Doti said a full slate of construction
projects at its campus in Orange, including a $25-million film
studio, left him no time to take on the station and its conversion to
a new technology.</TE>
<TE>   With an Oct. 1 deadline for bids, that left the KOCE-TV Foundation
as the sole suitor, foundation board chairman Bob Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "The objective of our proposal is to make sure KOCE remains a
community owned and operated station with a license that is
controlled within the community," Brown said. "This is really an
investment in the future of Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   The community college district board needs to approve the deal,
and a vote might not come for three or four months, district
spokeswoman Erin Cohn said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not anything that's going to happen right away," she said.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $4.5 million is needed to upgrade facilities and
cameras at KOCE's studios at Golden West College in Huntington Beach.
That would allow KOCE to produce programs that take full advantage of
the four channels on which it will be able to broadcast a signal
using digital technology. The additional channels are expected to be
used by schools and colleges for educational programming.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said the district's solicitation for bids dried up
fund-raising for this second stage of digital conversion, as
potential donors were uncertain whether KOCE--and its valuable
broadcast license--would remain in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   If the foundation's takeover of the station is approved, Brown
said he expects the additional money could be raised within nine
months.</TE>
<TE>   KOCE's switch to a digital transmitter atop Mt. Wilson in January
could increase the station's audience by 40%. But to the average
viewer, who doesn't own a digital television or a conversion box, the
change will go unnoticed for now.</TE>
<TE>   Under FCC rules, analog broadcasts nationwide won't disappear from
the airwaves until December 2006, said Roger Yoakum, KOCE's director
of engineering and chief engineer.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer has to catch up," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Moves to Replace Two Airport Commission Members</HD>
<DH>LAX: The two express surprise and say their outspokenness
may be behind the action. Both had often challenged the panel's
leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn has asked the City Council to remove two of the
most outspoken members of the Los Angeles Airport Commission several
years before their terms run out.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn made the request as he worked to complete his $9.6-billion
proposal to modernize aging Los Angeles International Airport. The
commission is expected to consider the plan sometime next year.</LD>
<LD>   Both of the commissioners Hahn seeks to replace--the panel's vice
president, Warren Valdry, and Westchester representative Ruth Mahala
Brown Walter--said they were surprised by the action and speculated
that Hahn wants to remove them because they frequently question the
leadership of Commission President Ted Stein.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said it is not unusual for a mayor
to switch commissioners mid-term. Hahn wants to make sure that a
"number of people have the opportunity to serve," Middlebrook said.</TE>
<TE>   Pending City Council approval, Valdry would be replaced by Peter
Weil, a real estate lawyer who sits on the city's Planning
Commission. Walter would be replaced by Alan Llorens, a corporate
communications manager at Southern California Edison and Westchester
community activist.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn sent letters to the council Sept. 30, announcing the proposed
appointments and seeking formal approval.</TE>
<TE>   Valdry, a businessman appointed to the commission in 1993 by Mayor
Richard Riordan, often has clashed with Stein, a lawyer who has
raised money for Hahn. Valdry's term is scheduled to expire June 30,
2004.</TE>
<TE>   "You are the first to share with me that I'm being asked to
leave," Valdry told a reporter Thursday. "I guess I was asking too
many questions."</TE>
<TE>   Middlebrook disputed the assertion that Valdry had not been
informed of his removal.</TE>
<TE>   "Valdry was told," Middlebrook said. Deputy Mayor Troy Edwards
"told him directly."</TE>
<TE>   Walter, a retired schoolteacher and a Westchester resident for 33
years, was appointed by Hahn in July 2001. Her term is to expire June
30, 2005.</TE>
<TE>   She said she received a call from Edwards on Wednesday, informing
her that the mayor was going to replace her and asking if she was
interested in sitting on any other city commissions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a total shock," Walter said. "My understanding is that I was
to serve for my full term. I'm quite sure I asked too many
questions."</TE>
<TE>   Walter and Valdry have previously complained that Stein left them
"completely out of the loop" on such important matters as extending
the contract for the airport's major food and beverage providers and
on efforts to draft a new modernization plan for LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Valdry often challenged Stein's stewardship of the commission.
Earlier this year, he wrote a stinging six-page memo to Stein,
accusing the commission president of "autocratic leadership" and
complaining about Stein's conduct at a meeting with staff members for
the city agency that operates LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "Your manner was confrontational, abrasive, disrespectful and
uncivil," Valdry wrote. He said Stein had ordered him to leave the
meeting with potential bidders on a contract to place commercial
advertising throughout the airport because he had not been invited.</TE>
<TE>   Weil, whose term on the Planning Commission doesn't expire for
four more years, is a Hahn insider well-versed in planning issues. He
has served on the city's Board of Zoning Appeals and its Rent
Adjustment Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Weil clearly has spoken his mind and has challenged staff at the
planning level and voted against council members' wishes on matters
when he feels it's appropriate," said City Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski. "His experience on the Planning Commission with issues
like traffic and how it impacts a neighborhood will provide a useful
perspective on the Airport Commission."</TE>
<TE>   Weil, who said the mayor's office called him last week, agreed
that his planning experience would be useful in working to improve
the city's aging international gateway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an interesting time," said Weil, a partner in Los
Angeles-based Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil &amp;
Shapiro. "They're working on a new master plan and a lot of other
important land-use issues."</TE>

<HD>Giving Kids Back the Sound of Music</HD>
<DH>Education: Amid budget cuts, Oxnard elementary district is
reviving on a smaller scale a program that was axed 11 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Boeing remembers it well. The budget was tight, they said, and
music--which he had taught in Oxnard elementary schools for 23
years--was on the chopping block.</LD>
<LD>   Administrators grumbled. Parents and students protested. But in
the spring of 1991, school district leaders decided to ax the
thriving program.</LD>
<LD>   Now, more than a decade later, Oxnard school leaders have decided
it's time for a music revival.</LD>
<TE>   Boeing has been rehired to run a pilot program at five elementary
schools, where he is teaching fifth- and sixth-graders to play any
instrument they choose, from the violin to the tuba.</TE>
<TE>   "Music helps kids academically and helps them to stay out of
trouble," said Boeing, 61, whose energy for his craft is evident
within minutes of meeting him. "Ten years' worth of kids didn't get
that chance."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard's move comes, ironically, in the middle of another fiscal
crunch that has forced education cuts throughout California.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, school board members slashed $2.3 million from the
2002-03 school year's $114-million budget, both by cutting costs and
shifting funds from other sources.</TE>
<TE>   But they added $100,000 annually to restore music.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, we have always felt that the arts, and music in
particular, is an important part of education, but unfortunately
everything can't be a priority," said Richard Duarte, superintendent
of the Oxnard Elementary School District. "At this point, we are
attempting to recognize that the arts have a priority, and we're
trying to open that door."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the limited budget, only five schools are participating
the first year.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure fairness, officials divided the district into five equal
areas and chose schools from each in a lottery system, said Martha
Hernandez, who is coordinating the program. They are Brekke, Ramona,
Sierra Linda, Marina West and Lemonwood.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to start small and plant a seed that will hopefully
grow into a full program over the next five years," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Boeing--who has taught first grade at Harrington
Elementary School since the music program ended in 1991--said
Oxnard's new program will work a lot like the one that was in place
11 years ago, but on a much smaller scale.</TE>
<TE>   He will move from school to school, teaching three to four classes
at each, in strings, woodwinds, brass and advanced band. He also will
help guide teachers at other grade levels in incorporating music,
either via wind instruments called recorders or basic music
appreciation, into their classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest hurdles to the music classes, which began this
week, will be obtaining instruments: The program doesn't have any.</TE>
<TE>   Children will have to rent or buy their own until the program can
amass donated instruments or raise money to buy instruments, Boeing
said.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing said he got his start in music as a fourth-grader, when he
learned to play the clarinet in school. He never stopped loving music
and still plays saxophone in a Ventura-based band that gives free
concerts every year.</TE>
<TE>   He also enjoys teaching, which he has done for 37 years. He said
the rewards are in the positive effect on students--whether improved
achievement in other subjects or just the look on a young flutist's
face when she nails a high C without squeaking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to do and it's relaxing to play," Boeing said. "I want
to help other people, especially kids, feel that too."</TE>
<TE>   Elementary grades are a good place to start, he said. Not only do
children pick up the playing of musical instruments easily at a young
age, they tend to lose interest in trying by the time they get to
junior high.</TE>
<TE>   "At that age, the hormones have kicked in," Boeing said.</TE>
<TE>   Fundi Legohn, director of the Oxnard High School band, said he has
felt the effects of the elementary district's lack of a music
program. Overall interest in band is down, he said, and those who do
come in have only one to two years of experience from junior high.</TE>
<TE>   Other Ventura County districts with programs for younger students
have an automatic advantage, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though many school districts had to cut back or eliminate music
programs in the early 1990s, several have since been able to
reinstitute or expand them.</TE>
<TE>   Hueneme, Ocean View, Pleasant Valley, Conejo Valley and Simi
Valley school districts all offer instrumental music for children
beginning in the fourth grade. Rio Elementary and Ventura Unified
remain without.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard school board member Dorothie Sterling, who was on the board
when the program was cut, said she will fight to see the program
expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Although she had some concerns about reintroducing the classes at
the same time the district is implementing major budget cuts,
Sterling said she is convinced it is the district's job to teach
music.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a core program--just like reading and math," Sterling said.</TE>
<TE>   To donate an instrument to Oxnard's new music program, call Martha
Hernandez at the school district at 487-3918.</TE>

<LD>Republican congressional candidate Jeff Chavez, who dropped out of

the March primary, is back in.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez said an unexplained family situation that precipitated his
decision in March was resolved more quickly than expected. He said
his campaign will send mail to voters in the district this month.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll have a budget sufficient to put out a handful of strong
pieces to a broad mix of voters in the district," he said. "It'll get
the message out."</LD>
<TE>   Chavez dismayed local Republican leaders when he announced shortly

<LD>A coalition of environmentalists has written to Gov. Gray Davis to
urge him to continue supporting efforts to convert a trailer park at
the historic Crystal Cove State Park into a state campground.</LD>
<LD>   The residents of the El Moro trailer park, whose leases expire in
two years, have sued, accusing the state of an inadequate
environmental report for a state park.</LD>
<LD>   "The public bought the land for Crystal Cove State Park in 1979,
and it's their turn to enjoy El Moro Canyon and beach. El Moro Canyon
is the only access point in the park for both beach and canyons, and
the conversion to a much lower-intensity use will benefit both public
and wildlife," said Elisabeth Brown, president of Laguna Greenbelt
Inc., one of the coalition groups.</LD>

<HD>Students Catch Rare Glimpse of High Court</HD>
<DH>State justices let classes observe arguments in a live
case to help improve understanding of the judicial system.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mojave High School senior James Webb woke up three hours before
sunrise to see the California Supreme Court in action.</LD>
<LD>   He and six classmates drove 60 miles to Bakersfield to watch a
live broadcast this week of the oral arguments before the high court
in a Calabasas murder case.</LD>
<LD>   They also witnessed a small piece of history.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Supreme Court has in the past televised selected
proceedings with widespread interest, such as those involving the
constitutionality of the three-strikes law, its programming has never
before been geared to use in classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   To mark the occasion, hundreds of students from across the Central
Valley studied the history and procedures of the high court and some
of the legal issues justices would confront during their visit.</TE>
<TE>   The court's outreach to students is unprecedented, according to
Chief Justice Ronald M. George. The goal is simple.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they get a better understanding of the workings of our
system of justice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before getting down to official business, George, dressed in a
black robe and surrounded on the bench by the court's six associate
justices, greeted students in the audience and those watching the
broadcast elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In another break with tradition, the justices took a few prepared
questions from their teenage audience before calling the first case.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening remarks, George described the program as "a unique
learning experience," and marveled at how technology can "expand the
walls of the courtroom."</TE>
<TE>   About 120 students watched inside the small Fresno courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   In Bakersfield, four local appellate justices--Dennis A. Cornell,
Nickolas J. Dibiaso, Gene M. Gomes and Rebecca A. Wiseman--watched
the broadcast with more than 150 high school students in a conference
room at school district headquarters. They answered questions about
cases, procedure and their job as jurists.</TE>
<TE>   One student asked, "How many times have you been bribed?"</TE>
<TE>   A startled Gomes quickly responded, "Do you mean how many times
have there been attempts to bribe us?" he asked. The short answer was
never.</TE>
<TE>   Another student, referring to the recent murder of a Bakersfield
prosecutor, asked if the justices ever feared for their lives. Gomes
told the group that judges learn to live with death threats. He said
he has sentenced more than 60,000 defendants during his 11 years as a
trial judge "and, you know, not everyone was happy."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the student program focused on convicted murderer Robert
Rosenkrantz, 35, who was denied parole after serving 17 years in
prison. He was convicted in 1985 of slaying a classmate who revealed
Rosenkrantz's homosexuality to the killer's father.</TE>
<TE>   The inmate's attorneys have accused Gov. Gray Davis of illegally
refusing to parole any murderers. Davis' attorneys said the governor
holds the ultimate power to decide about prison releases.</TE>
<TE>   For more than an hour, the Supreme Court justices engaged
attorneys in the Rosenkrantz case as students watched for clues about
how the court might rule.</TE>
<TE>   Most students--from government classes and mock trial
teams--weren't intimidated by references to habeas corpus or ex post
facto. At Bakersfield High School, students had studied the
Rosenkrantz case and were familiar with the legal issues.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching out to high school students is part of a larger effort by
the California judiciary to build public confidence in its branch of
government through increased access to judges and the courts.</TE>
<TE>   As chief justice, George has made community outreach a cornerstone
of his tenure. He personally crisscrossed the state, visiting all 58
counties, during his first year in the top job in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, he stressed the importance of educating
the public about the judicial system. Ignorance about the court, he
said, is widespread and cuts through all socioeconomic levels.</TE>
<TE>   "I have had educated individuals come to the appellate courts and
ask, 'Where is the jury box?' " George said. (Appellate issues are
decided by a panel of justices, not a jury.)</TE>
<TE>   As part of the outreach effort, the Supreme Court has begun to
take its show on the road. Last year, the court held oral arguments
in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the Supreme Court meets in San Francisco, Los
Angeles and Sacramento, with the October session set in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Presiding Justice James A. Ardaiz of the 5th District Court of
Appeal invited the high court to Fresno a year ago. When the justices
accepted, he began working on a plan to involve students.</TE>
<TE>   In his efforts, Ardaiz secured seats in the courtroom for students
from as far away as Tulare and Kings counties. He persuaded the
Supreme Court justices to take a few moments to answer students'
questions. And he enticed local cable channels as well as the
California Channel to broadcast the Supreme Court to a broader
audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Our objective was to create a program that would show a case
argued before the Supreme Court," Ardaiz said, crediting the justices
with being "good sports" for consenting to the arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Kern County educators worked with the court to prepare a study
guide that was widely distributed over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The government class at Bakersfield High School studied the
Rosenkrantz case for a week before watching the oral argument.</TE>
<TE>   Several seniors conceded that the case was sometimes difficult to
follow. Yet they were conversant with its key issues and had their
own opinions on a just outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they should put him on parole," said Nicole D. Yap,
noting that Rosenkrantz was 18 when he entered prison.</TE>
<TE>   One of the issues in the case is whether Davis has the power to
review Rosenkrantz's parole, because California governors lacked that
authority at the time Rosenkrantz was convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Yap never used the Latin terms favored by attorneys and judges in
explaining her opinion of the case. But she proved that she had
picked up some of those concepts in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   She compared the deal Rosenkrantz had with prison authorities at
the time of his conviction to her cell phone plan: You can't change
the conditions after you've signed up for the service.</TE>
<TE>   Her friend, Claudia Flores, was less interested in the televised
proceedings. She liked the live discussion with the local appellate
court justices much better.</TE>
<TE>   But she was a bit disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be more like 'Judge Judy,' " Flores said.</TE>

<LD>From a concert hall in Tel Aviv to an intimate nightclub in San
Francisco to a high school auditorium in Van Nuys, musicians of all
genres joined in a worldwide tribute honoring slain journalist Daniel
Pearl on Thursday, the day he would have turned 39.</LD>
<LD>   Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped and slain
by terrorists in Pakistan in January, was an accomplished classical
violinist, bluegrass fiddler and mandolin player.</LD>
<LD>   In every community he lived, event organizers said, he joined a
band, orchestra or chamber group, leaving behind a long trail of
musician friends.</LD>
<TE>   The Daniel Pearl Foundation, established by his family in April,
put together the international concert to commemorate Pearl's love of
music and commitment to dialogue among people of different
backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's desire for tolerance and global unity was evident at
performances throughout Los Angeles on Thursday as musicians playing
jazz, bluegrass, rock, folk and classical works came to celebrate his
legacy of promoting cross-cultural understanding.</TE>
<TE>   At the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, more than 200 visitors
viewed a large photograph of Pearl set above his beloved violin and
signed a memorial book as traditional Jewish folk music played.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided that this was a way to both celebrate this Renaissance
man and to remind people that he was murdered because he was a Jew
and an American," said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the museum's associate
dean. "It is the kind of gesture he would have appreciated and lets
our small corner add something to the musical quilt in his honor."</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was memorialized at his alma mater, Birmingham High School
in Van Nuys, in an hourlong concert before several hundred students
in the performing arts center.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli American singer and songwriter Tova brought many in the
audience to tears with a haunting ballad, "Dear Daniel," written from
the perspective of Pearl's infant son.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's widow, Mariane Pearl, gave birth to the couple's only
child, Adam, four months after her husband disappeared on Jan. 23 in
Karachi, Pakistan, while investigating local ties between "shoe
bomber" Richard Reid and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network.</TE>
<TE>   Among the verses of "Dear Daniel," which the 17-year-old Tova sang
plaintively to a hushed audience:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I want to tell you that I'm sorry</TE>
<TE>   That you can't see me laugh or cry</TE>
<TE>   I never got to call you daddy</TE>
<TE>   And I don't know the reason why</TE>
<TE>   They say you couldn't wait to hold me</TE>
<TE>   And that you couldn't wait for me to know</TE>
<TE>   All the things you planned to teach me</TE>
<TE>   All the things I would've known</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other local tributes Thursday included a jazz concert and readings
from a collection of Pearl's articles in Covina, and performances by
the Kadima String Quartet at three locations in the San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestras and ensembles were scheduled to perform in remembrance
of Pearl in more than 50 cities worldwide, including Hong Kong,
Shanghai, Bangkok, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, London, New York, Boston and
San Francisco, organizers said.</TE>

<HD>Mayor Urges Cooley to File Hate Charges in Beating</HD>
<DH>Rally: Hahn says decision not to seek longer term in West
Hollywood assault 'sends the wrong message.' Cooley has said there's
no evidence of a hate motive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY WOLCOTT and DANIEL HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As actor Trev Broudy returned to his parents' house from the hospital
Thursday to recuperate from a severe beating Sept. 2, Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn called on Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley to reconsider
the decision not to file hate crime charges against the men accused
of the attack.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing a crowd of about 300 gathered in West Hollywood to
remember Matthew Shepard, murdered four years ago in Wyoming because
he was gay, Hahn said Cooley's decision in the attack on Broudy
"sends the wrong message."</LD>
<LD>   "If he needs more time to investigate it," Hahn said, "take the
time to make the decision correctly."</LD>
<TE>   Hahn was more blunt in a letter he sent to Cooley a week ago
criticizing him for filing charges suggesting that "crimes motivated
by hate against members of the gay community will not be enforced to
the full extent of the law."</TE>
<TE>   "In so doing," Hahn said, "the decision unfortunately perpetuated
the harm that was caused by these attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, a former Los Angeles city attorney, and Sheriff Lee Baca
both have urged Cooley to amend the charges to include hate crime,
which could potentially add one to four years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Broudy, who was hit in the head numerous times with a baseball
bat, was released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and went to his
parents' home in Carpinteria.</TE>
<TE>   Broudy was attacked after he and his friend Edward Ulett hugged
goodbye on Cynthia Street, just off Santa Monica Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing the evidence, the district attorney's office
charged Larry Walker, 29; Vincent Dotson, 18; and Torwin Sessions,
19; each with one count of attempted robbery, two counts of assault
with a deadly weapon and one of conspiracy to commit robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The three men have pleaded not guilty on all counts.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley has said there is no evidence to indicate that the assault
on Broudy and Ulett was a hate crime because the attackers didn't say
anything about the victim's homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Millington, who heads the district attorney's hate crimes
unit, said Wednesday: "I have reviewed the case, the district
attorney and his executive staff has reviewed it. We are unanimous in
our opinion that we cannot prove a hate crime beyond a reasonable
doubt."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Plain and simple, to charge based on public opinion or
political pressure is improper."</TE>
<TE>   But Broudy's father, Sherrill, said Thursday night that his son
and the family believe the attack was motivated by hate.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question about it," Sherrill Broudy said. "If they
wanted to rob him, they could have taken the money he had with him,
but in our estimation, robbers are usually looking for someone
affluent, and he was out in his regular clothes. We all believe this
was ... gay bashing."</TE>
<TE>   Trev Broudy's stepmother, Charlene, said he is tired, angry and
sad but hopeful of recovery. The parents say Broudy can remember bits
and pieces from around the time of the attack, but some things elude
him.</TE>
<TE>   "When we went to his apartment before coming here, he tried to use
his computer but had difficulty and started to cry," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors are uncertain about his chances for a full recovery,
Broudy's family said, and say he may eventually need a plate in his
skull.</TE>
<TE>   "They attacked a person with enormous potential and permanently
altered that," Sherrill Broudy said. His son is "improving, but he
still has a long way to go," he said. On Wednesday, West Hollywood
Mayor Sal Guarriello announced an effort to collect signatures from
10% of the registered voters in Los Angeles County within 160 days on
petitions to recall Cooley from office.</TE>
<TE>   "I have zero tolerance for people who commit hate crimes against
my residents and visitors," he said. "I also have zero tolerance for
district attorneys who fail to adequately prosecute people who come
into West Hollywood and commit hate crimes."</TE>

<HD>Infrastructure Graded and Warnings Sounded</HD>
<DH>Facilities: County gets a C overall, with its direst
problems being schools and urban runoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Schools in disrepair. Backed-up sewers. Polluted beaches.</LD>
<LD>   Is Orange County threatened with an infrastructure meltdown?</LD>
<LD>   A UC Irvine-led coalition of academics, development consultants,
public officials and others are warning that the county may be if the
problems are left unresolved. The group spent six months studying the
county's infrastructure, leading to Thursday's release of a "report
card" on it.</LD>
<TE>   Although the county's overall infrastructure rates a C, the grade
is dangerously close to an F for schools and urban runoff. Grades are
also in significant danger of sliding even in those areas where the
county is doing well.</TE>
<TE>   The project is an offshoot of an annual national report card that
the American Society of Civil Engineers began putting out last year.
In the society's March report, the nation's average infrastructure
grade was a D-plus. Orange County fares better, those involved in the
project say, because most of the roads, sewers, water systems and
other public facilities are newer.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Bein, who was president of the society when the national
report card came out and is the CEO of RBF Consulting in Irvine,
organized the Orange County project with UCI Civil and Environmental
Engineering Affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   "We did this to raise awareness that we are living on borrowed
time with our infrastructure," he said. "Now is the time to put in
the resources needed that will get our infrastructure back up to a
level that can support the quality of life we are used to in Orange
County."</TE>
<TE>   The report graded eight areas: transportation, schools, water,
aviation, parks, urban runoff, waste water and solid waste. The
grades were given by committees of experts from each field who
collected and evaluated data. Review councils of industry leaders,
environmentalists and academics then critiqued the findings.</TE>
<TE>   The schools group found widespread evidence of leaking roofs,
broken pipes, seismic safety problems and even sinking buildings.
They gave a grade of D-plus.</TE>
<TE>   The county fared even worse on urban runoff, which received the
lowest grade of all, a D. The report explained the grade by citing
the 1999 shoreline closures in Huntington Beach. It says massive
improvements to the county's flood control system are needed. But it
would take $1.2 billion worth of such improvements to bring the urban
runoff grade to an A.</TE>
<TE>   There was better news in the areas of water and solid waste, which
each received a B. But the report warned that the grade could easily
slip if those systems aren't shored up and improved.</TE>
<TE>   The report says most of these issues can be solved only at the
local level.</TE>
<TE>   "This places responsibility for infrastructure renewal and
development squarely with individual voters," the report says.</TE>

<TE>   Room for Improvement</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine led a coalition, which included engineers and public
officials, to assess Orange County's infrastructure and "raise
awareness that we are living on borrowed time." The coalition report
card:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WATER -- B</TE>
<TE>   The county has 7,500 miles of water main pipes and 300 drinking
water storage tanks that are aging.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AVIATION -- C+</TE>
<TE>   Commercial air and air cargo demands need long-term solutions. The
forecast for annual passengers in the county by 2025: 37 million,
compared with the 8.4 million-passenger cap now at John Wayne
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SCHOOL FACILITIES -- D+</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the county's public school buildings are old,
outdated or overcrowded.</TE>

<TE>   PARKS, RECREATION, ENVIRONMENT -- C</TE>
<TE>   More state aid is recommended to maintain services.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TRANSPORTATION -- C</TE>
<TE>   Another funding source like Measure M is needed to continue
maintaining and improving the county's transportation system.</TE>

<TE>   More revenue is needed to improve aging facilities, and for new
stormwater projects.</TE>

<HD>Spotlight Is Cast on Paid Endorsements</HD>
<DH>Mailers: Rapid growth of political fliers brings charges
that candidate listings are for sale to the highest bidder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Slate mailers, an increasingly popular form of political
communication in California, are giving candidates new opportunities
to reach the electorate--but are also undermining campaign finance
rules and, according to critics, handing out endorsements to the
highest bidder.</LD>
<LD>   The multimillion-dollar business produces pamphlets sent to
millions of voters. The pamphlets purport to list candidates endorsed
by public service organizations but, in reality, candidates pay
political consultants to appear on the mailings, bartering for the
cost of an endorsement.</LD>
<LD>   Normally, slate mailers operate in the background of the state's
political campaigns, churning out mail but otherwise attracting
little attention. This week, however, one of the groups was thrust
into the limelight when the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Bill
Simon Jr., charged that Gov. Gray Davis had accepted campaign
contributions on government property--which, if true, would have been
illegal. The contribution, Simon alleged, had come from a law
enforcement group known as the California Organization of Police and
Sheriffs, which operates one of the slates.</LD>
<TE>   In the aftermath of those charges, which were quickly disproved,
campaign disclosure reports revealed that Simon had paid $300,000 for
a position on the group's mailings. The police group has given Davis
its support in the past, but endorsed Simon over Davis this year
after the GOP candidate bought a slot on its slate. Davis, a Democrat
who ran essentially unopposed during the primary, refused to buy one.</TE>
<TE>   The police group has received more than $750,000 in contributions
to its slate mail committee during the first nine months of this
year. Kelley Moran, the group's political director, was paid $175,000
in 2000, the last full election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   A largely California phenomenon, slates allow little-known
candidates who cannot normally afford television advertising a chance
to get their name before the state's massive, diffuse electorate.
Their backers say they give underdogs a chance against well-funded
opponents and give the electorate what it wants.</TE>
<TE>   Appealing to Voters</TE>
<TE>   "If you find an electorate that is interested in reading political
debate along the lines of the Federalist Papers, you will see
consultants turning out literature along the lines of the Federalist
Papers," said Daniel Lowenstein, a law professor at UCLA who
represents slate mailers. "You turn out an electorate where it's hard
to get their attention," he continued, and voters will find slate
cards.</TE>
<TE>   Slates must publicly disclose the money that they are paid for
endorsements in campaign reports, but efforts to impose additional
regulations have been mixed.</TE>
<TE>   The mailers are required to include an asterisk next to the names
of candidates or initiatives that they endorse in return for payment.
The 1998 campaign finance initiative, Proposition 208, would have
required that marking to become a dollar sign. The slates
successfully challenged that provision in court.</TE>
<TE>   Several slates also use the names of the state's major political
parties in their titles, but can make endorsements contrary to the
party line for a fee. Legislators have tried to force mailers to
disclose when they contradict party endorsements, but a federal court
last month overturned the regulation, ruling that it interfered with
the slates' 1st Amendment rights.</TE>
<TE>   "It tells you how difficult it is to have 'election reform,' "
said the author of the measure, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton
(D-San Francisco). Of slate makers, he added: "They ain't ... in it
for good government; they're in it to make money."</TE>
<TE>   Slates rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, at first under
the control of partisan organizations such as the Westside Democratic
Berman-Waxman machine. But the slate business has evolved since then,
with many of the mailers representing themselves as nonpartisan
interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   California's Secretary of State lists 220 slate mailer groups,
compared with the roughly 60 that were registered 12 years ago. They
range from small neighborhood lists focused on local city council
races to massive statewide mailings that churn through hundreds of
thousands of dollars in fees every election season.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of getting your two or three pieces of mail from
Berman-Waxman, now everybody gets tons of them," said a veteran
Democratic political consultant, Bill Carrick. "You have public
officials hustling a slate. You have people doing it around issues,
or in some cases pseudo-issues."</TE>
<TE>   Medical Slate Mailer</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years ago, political consultant Rob Katherman was
having a drink with an advisor to the Los Angeles County Medical
Assn. when the two hit on an idea: How about starting a slate that
endorses candidates who are good for health care? From that came
Californians for Quality Health Care.</TE>
<TE>   Katherman, who also publishes a larger slate called Republican
Voter Checklist, which is not affiliated with the Republican Party,
said that he relies on medical advisors to say which candidates are
"green-lighted, yellow-lighted or red-lighted." He requires
candidates to at least get a "yellow light" before he offers them
spots on the slate, but said he is open about what he does.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a business and we certainly will make no bones about it,"
Katherman said. "What we are trying to do, besides make some money,
is to get candidates that are reasonably disposed to our position."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Toman, a candidate for the GOP nomination for state
treasurer, in January agreed to pay Katherman's company $5,000 to
appear on the Republican Voter Checklist in the March primary,
according to court papers. But four weeks, later a representative of
the mailer called Toman and told her it would list her rival, Greg
Conlon, because he had paid $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Toman sued to stop the slate from backing her rival, alleging
breach of contract. A Los Angeles judge granted the injunction and
forced the slate to go out to 800,000 voters with Toman's name on it.</TE>
<TE>   Katherman said money was not the issue--it was his longtime
friendship with one of Conlon's consultants, Ron Rogers. In court
papers, Katherman's attorney said that Rogers' firm had made a
payment for "the right of first refusal" on the slate. Katherman did
not recall that money had changed hands but said that he had reserved
the space and that an employee erroneously sold the spot to Toman.</TE>
<TE>   Some consultants involved with slates argue that a handful of
questionable slates tarnishes the entire industry. "We aren't all the
same," said Larry Levine, a San Fernando Valley consultant who runs
what observers say is California's biggest slate, the Voter
Information Guide. "There are those of us who try to adhere to some
ideological principle and I think do a pretty good job."</TE>
<TE>   Levine, a Democrat who works closely with unions, has three
employees cranking out 1.5 million to 3.2 million mailings per
election cycle. Those mailings generally promote Democratic
candidates. His consulting company earned $323,000 from the operation
in 2000, though Levine stressed that some of that had gone to
overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Working with sophisticated computer programs that sort through
databases of registered voters, Levine tailors each mailing to the
city council and legislative district in which the voter lives.
Voters on the Eastside will find candidates for offices representing
their neighborhoods; Valley voters will see an entirely different
group of recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Business vs. Ideology</TE>
<TE>   Levine said he tries to adhere to his Democratic ideology and
gives free space to several Democratic candidates. But, he said,
business demands occasionally intrude.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in 1996, Levine's slate bucked the Democratic party
line and backed three ballot measures that would have limited
lawsuits against a range of companies. Levine said he was originally
going to oppose the measures, but had to change his position because
the Democratic opponents of the initiative pulled out of a commitment
to pay $90,000. Levine said he had to call the initiatives' backers
to recoup some of the money. He ultimately received $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I was left with a huge hole in my financing and a commitment to
get other pieces out, and I had to do something," Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) for 20 years has sent a
slate of recommendations to her constituents in South Los Angeles.
Her endorsement has become highly prized in local elections. In last
year's city attorney's race, the mailer, run by Waters' daughter
Karen, backed then-City Councilman Mike Feuer after receiving a
$10,000 contribution. But it switched in the runoff election,
endorsing then-Deputy Mayor Rocky Delgadillo after receiving a
$35,000 payment from him.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Levine, Feuer's consultant, said that Karen Waters had
sought more money from the campaign in the general election--though
he added that he also had known that Waters was under political
pressure to change her endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   Waters said the switch came because she disagreed with stances
Feuer had taken on airport expansion after her initial endorsement.
"My recommendations aren't done because people can pay in," Waters
said.</TE>
<TE>   Waters' slate received money from other individuals and groups to
pay for Delgadillo's spot on the mailer, according to state records.
Some of those contributions exceeded the city's $1,000 cap on
donations to citywide candidates. For example, defense lawyer Mark
Geragos gave the slate $1,500 to support Delgadillo; Pedus Building
Services Inc. donated $2,000 on his behalf; and Premier Building
Maintenance Services gave $1,500.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Davis backers have charged that Simon bought the
endorsement of the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs by
paying for his place on the group's mailer. Similar accusations have
been made in the past against other groups, including the Howard
Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Named after the architect of the 1978 tax-limitation Proposition
13, the group supports a slate mailer that recommends candidates to
the organization's 400,000 members, mostly homeowners and
high-propensity voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Candidates running for office who share the same philosophy as
the committee are encouraged to apply for our program with a
deposit," said a letter from the Save Proposition 13 committee,
mailed to candidates and political consultants in September 2001 as
the primary season heated up. The letter also urged candidates to ask
about the incumbent discount.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Bill Lord-Butcher, the Jarvis association's political
consultant who also helps run the slate, sent a letter to Timothy
Draper, the multimillionaire backer of a school voucher initiative,
proposing that Draper pay the slate mail group $850,000 to endorse
the voucher measure. Draper refused, and the Jarvis taxpayer
association backed the campaign against the measure, which paid the
slate mailer $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   That money, in part, goes to people who are close to the taxpayer
association, though the association said none of its executives makes
money from the slate. Lord-Butcher received $220,000 in payments from
the slate group to his Orange County direct-mail firm in 2000. Joel
Fox, who had stepped down as the Jarvis group's president at the end
of 1998, was paid $43,000.</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis Executive Director Kris Vosburg said that the slate is
separate from the Jarvis association and denied that payments to the
slate committee would influence whether the Jarvis association
endorsed a candidate or ballot measure. To get on the slate,
candidates must agree to back Proposition 13; to gain the Jarvis
association's endorsement requires a more detailed interview.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the voucher initiative, Vosburg said the Jarvis
group would have opposed it, even if it had bought onto the slate
that the organization backs.</TE>
<TE>   Vosburg said the Jarvis association endorses the Save Proposition
13 slate because it finds it one of the few honest ones in the field.
"Generally speaking," he said, "I think slates are very misleading."</TE>
<TE>   This year, a slate mailer was credited for helping unseat Orange
County Supervisor Cynthia Coad, who had backed building an airport at
the closed El Toro Marine Corps base. The mailer was operated by the
political consultants who ran the initiative opposing an airport at
the base.</TE>
<TE>   It backed Coad's opponent, Chris Norby, and gave most of its space
over to attacking Coad.</TE>
<TE>   As such, the supervisor's backers charged it amounted to a
$140,000 attack ad for Norby, which would have vastly exceeded the
county's $1,000 contribution limit.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors this summer approved new campaign
restrictions that would essentially bar any such coordinated effort
in the future by limiting candidates to $1,000 for slates and
requiring them to pay for mailers that devote more than 25% to
attacking an opponent.</TE>

<HD>Councilman Fox Leads the Pack in Campaign Funds</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: The incumbent has collected more than
$78,000 so far, almost three times more than his nearest challenger
in the race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two-term incumbent Andy Fox has amassed a campaign war chest nearly
three times the size of his nearest challenger in November's Thousand
Oaks City Council race.</LD>
<LD>   Fox, one of nine candidates vying for three full-term seats on the
panel, gathered 527 contributions totaling $78,178 this year, with
$60,543 arriving from July 1 through Sept. 30, according to campaign
finance documents released this week.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just very gratified that 500-some residents who live in the
community have appreciated the job I've done and my independence on
the City Council," Fox said. "I look forward to continuing to do a
good job for them."</LD>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Gillette, who is seeking a second four-year
term, received $27,353 through the end of September, of which $13,718
arrived after July 1, making him second in fund-raising at this stage
in the race. He lent his campaign $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Deposed Planning Commission Chairman Michael Farris, one of four
candidates running together as the so-called Certified Slow Growth
Team, raised $26,558.64 to date. This included $11,000 in loans to
his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In the contest to determine who will serve out the term of
Councilwoman Linda Parks, who joins the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors in January, restaurateur Bob Wilson--a Farris running
mate--leads a trio of candidates for the two-year post. He collected
$23,950, which includes a $16,000 personal loan.</TE>
<TE>   The other candidates running for Parks' seat are Randy Hoffman and
Donald H. Morris. Hoffman, a millionaire businessman who
unsuccessfully challenged Parks for the supervisor's post last
spring, has contributions of $8,374, including a $1,500 personal
loan. Morris, a retired Rockwell engineer, raised $4,472, including
$3,470 that he lent to his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commission Chairwoman Claudia Bill-de la Pena, another
member of the Certified Slow Growth Team, raised $22,088, which
includes a $7,000 personal loan. Laura Lee Custodio, a Granada Hills
English teacher and another slate candidate, raised $15,570,
including a $10,000 loan from her and her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Del Campo, another one-term incumbent seeking reelection, has
raised $11,055. Del Campo, who joined Custodio on a three-person
"Clean Sweep" slow-growth slate in 1998, has angered many of his
former supporters who maintain he often votes with council members
considered too friendly with development interests.</TE>
<TE>   Farris said members of his slate may have to abandon a voluntary
$25,000 spending cap, similar to a limit in effect during the council
contest four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We had hoped to keep the campaign spending to no more than
$25,000 each, but we also said we're not going to unilaterally lay
our arms down," Farris said. "So, if necessary, we may have to spend
more to make sure that we can get our message out."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the slate's message, Farris said, will be to challenge
Fox's position that he has been a champion for slow growth and open
space. Fox cites the conversion of more than 1,500 acres into public
open space and a measure he crafted that gives residents the right to
vote on any change to the city's General Plan.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a lot of money out there to try to convince people that
he is slow growth," Farris said of Fox. "Our job is to tell people we
don't think what he's done is true slow growth. Look at the amount of
development around town."</TE>
<TE>   Health care executive Rick D. Velasquez has raised $2,175, which
includes a $500 loan he made to his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Television producer David Sams reports he only collected $100 that
he and his wife lent to the campaign. He pledged not to accept any
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "I am running as the clean-slate candidate," he said. "When folks
cast their votes for me, they will know that I owe nothing to
anyone--except for the residents of Thousand Oaks. I'm starting out
clean--no favors to pay, no ax to grind."</TE>
<TE>   Sams hints that he will use more of his own money before Nov. 5.
"I believe that there is a time and a place to spend a hard-earned
dollar."</TE>
<TE>   Civil engineer David Seagal, who ran for the council in 1998, has
an even more spartan campaign. Not only does he refuse outside
donations, but he suggests he will spend next to nothing during the
race.</TE>
<TE>   "As a matter of conscience, I am not planning to raise any money,"
Seagal said. "I don't want to ask people for money unless I know I'm
going to go all the way in the campaign. Right now, I'd put my odds
of winning at about 1 in 100."</TE>

<HD>Tollway Agencies Create Board to Oversee Merger</HD>
<DH>Highways: Move could help San Joaquin Hills road avoid bond
default, fund proposed project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The boards of Orange County's two toll road agencies Thursday
unanimously approved a new 21-member governing body that would
oversee a probable merger, the first step in an effort to save the
financially ailing San Joaquin Hills toll road.</LD>
<LD>   If the merger is completed, the board would control all of the
county's tollways, replacing two governing bodies that now run the
San Joaquin Hills and Foothill/Eastern toll roads.</LD>
<LD>   The board would include representatives from the 18 cities and
three county supervisorial districts through which the highways run.</LD>
<TE>   The merger is necessary, officials say, to ensure that more than
$1 billion in bonds sold to pay for the San Joaquin Hills toll road
don't go into default, as they are expected to do by 2012. The
tollway, which runs from Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano, has
failed to meet traffic and revenue projections since opening in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Merging the toll roads would also help the Irvine-based
Transportation Corridor Agencies, which administers the two, to
successfully sell bonds for the proposed Foothill South tollway,
which would stretch from Mission Viejo to south of San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   "This will make us a better security risk and the bonds that we
would sell in the future would be at a better interest rate," said
Scott Diehl, chairman of the Foothill/Eastern corridor agency.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to be as efficient as we can be. Merging makes a lot
of sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the merger is contingent on the findings of a $1.84-million
traffic and revenue study, which is expected to be completed early
next year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police on Thursday released a composite sketch of one of two men
suspected of robbing and severely beating a former local resident
several months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The 52-year-old victim, who has asked not to be identified,
sustained major injuries in the attack and was unable to immediately
assist police. He later recovered and moved out of the area but
recently returned to help police with the drawing.</LD>
<LD>   According to Det. Rick Perez of the Port Hueneme Police
Department, the victim was attacked June 1 while walking with a
friend in the 100 block of B Street. He was repeatedly beaten with a
gun and kicked, Perez said.</LD>
<TE>   The robbers may have believed the victim was carrying a large
amount of money because he told several people that day that he had
sold some property. However, he had only a small amount of cash on
him, which was taken.</TE>
<TE>   His friend was not injured.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect whose sketch was released is described as about 6 feet
1 and 210 pounds. The other one wore a mask during the heist.</TE>

<LD>A 44-year-old man died Thursday when his car was struck head-on by
another vehicle, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Vincente M. Rivera, a nine-year employee at Moorpark Rubbish
Disposal in Simi Valley, was killed in the 5:15 a.m. crash in the
northbound lanes of Santa Clara Avenue just north of Central Avenue,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera of Oxnard was headed to work when his 1977 Ford Mustang was
struck by Jorge Luis Mejia's 1988 Mazda 626. Mejia, 24, was traveling
south on Santa Clara when his car drifted into the northbound lane,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Mejia of Santa Paula sustained cuts to his face and leg. He was
treated at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard and released,

<HD>U.S. Needs Alliances, Not Short-Term Allies</HD>
<DH>Bush's approach places global stability at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES E. GOODBY and KENNETH WEISBRODE</AU>
<BD>James E. Goodby is a retired diplomat with more than
four decades of service to the U.S. government; Kenneth Weisbrode is
a member of the Atlantic Council of the United States in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerns over American unilateralism have receded over the last few
weeks as the Bush administration and the president himself have
gradually begun to say positive things about the need for allies to
accomplish U.S. aims in the Middle East. Few proponents of war
against Iraq or any other evil regime now assert in principle that
the United States should act by itself or with just one or two
coalition partners.</LD>
<LD>   Polls show that a wide majority of Americans also reject "going it
alone." The shift toward a greater concern for allies is a positive
one; it has warmed the heart of the multilateralist backers of
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell in the administration and in the
media.</LD>
<LD>   However, the shift has overlooked a critical distinction. Allies
are not the same things as alliances. The latter subject has barely
been mentioned in the administration's public pronouncements.</LD>
<TE>   Aside from a bow to the importance of institutions such as NATO,
there is no hint in the recently released National Security Strategy
of the United States that alliances must play a central role in
establishing a democratic peace or that the U.S. is part of those
alliance systems. It speaks of allies and alliances in a single,
identical breath.</TE>
<TE>   Today's situational, short-term thinking presumes an automatic
link between friendly allies and stable regional environments. It is
much more akin to the mind of Cardinal Richelieu or Otto von Bismarck
than to the ways of the American and European democratic statesmen
who created NATO and the European Community.</TE>
<TE>   International diplomacy has evolved considerably during the last
half-century, mainly through the redefinition of an alliance as
something more than a temporary meeting of the minds and a pledge to
work together. The United States' and the world's most successful
20th century military alliances--NATO and the U.S.-Japan and
U.S.-Korea alliances--were institutional as well as political. They
were built on a sustained and deepening system of cooperation, across
many levels and at high frequency, over many years. The result has
been a far more stable international environment made possible by the
inherent trust that has emerged from working together so often for so
long.</TE>
<TE>   For some reason both the second Clinton and now the Bush
administrations have come to discard this very American reconception
of alliance organizations in favor of the traditional, Old World
approach: temporary allies of convenience rather than
institutionalized cooperation, or what many have come to call the
promotion of nascent "security communities."</TE>
<TE>   At the local level we might consider the distinction as one
between well-armed and adaptable police states and inherently safe
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The key task for the Bush administration is to convince current
and potential allies that such organizations are made up of more than
thin spokes emanating from an American hub with the sole aim of
nipping hostile threats in the bud.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of strong alliance structures means that allies will
require ever greater short-term incentives to support such aims and
will be ever more likely to defect or to seek alternatives to
complying with U.S. demands.</TE>
<TE>   To their vast credit, the statesmen of the 20th century realized
that the condition of "free security" for the United States had gone
the way of the clipper ship. Like it or not, the world had grown
interdependent; rather than fight that condition, these statesmen
sought to make it work in favor of U.S. (and, it may be argued,
world) interests. President Bush's oft-mentioned "balance of power
that favors freedom" seems to support that mission in principle. Yet
if the United States discards the form of interdependent,
institutional alliances for something more ad hoc and temporary, the
glue of international stability may soon dissolve. Increasingly,
Bush's vision will be viewed as a balance of power that favors U.S.
interests against all others. And in this condition no American will
be free of foreign dangers, or fear.</TE>
<TE>   Let us not forget all that we have learned since 1945 about the
value of alliances as well as allies. It is not too late to put
things back on the right track.</TE>

<HD>Gulf War Offers a Poor Model</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AVIGDOR HASELKORN</AU>
<BD>Avigdor Haselkorn is the author of "The Continuing
Storm: Iraq, Poisonous Weapons and Deterrence" (Yale University
Press, 1999).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several fallacies have found their way into the current debate about
the U.S. policy on Iraq. The most popular sees the 1991 Gulf War as a
model to be emulated in case of another conflict with Iraq.
Proponents of this argument demand that the United States act only
under the authority of the U.N. Security Council and as a member of a
coalition of like-minded countries.</LD>
<LD>   Such an approach would gain any new American military action
political legitimacy, it is argued. Further, the U.S. partners would
help defray the cost of the war.</LD>
<LD>   The Gulf War, however, is far from a paragon to be duplicated.
According to members of the former Bush administration, the U.S. did
not topple Saddam Hussein in 1991 because it sought to abide by the
U.N. mandate, which was limited to the liberation of Kuwait. Former
President Bush and his aides say they feared any deviation from that
mandate would fracture their hard-won coalition.</LD>
<TE>   So it follows that the coalition warfare model of Desert Storm is
responsible for leaving Hussein in power and for the fact that the
U.S. now must confront him again.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, since the end of that war, the U.S. effort to sustain
the coalition has enabled Russia, China and France to severely dilute
the U.N. inspection regime in their efforts to curry favor with the
Arab states. Coalition politics also have been responsible for Iraq
flouting U.N. resolutions with impunity.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to preserve the coalition allowed Iraq to play its
members against one another. As a result, according to a recent CIA
report, "key aspects of Iraq's offensive [biological warfare] program
are active and most elements more advanced and larger than before the
1990-1991 Gulf War."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the cost-sharing argument of Desert Storm, it is a
fallacy to believe that foreign contributions actually alleviated the
U.S. expense last time.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Congressional Research Service, the Gulf War cost
$61.1 billion, of which 80% was paid by other nations. It must be
recalled that after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, oil prices
climbed from $15 a barrel to $40 in two months. Prices remained high
for more than a year in what many economists saw as a tax on
worldwide consumers that allowed Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to pay down
the American and allied bill for the war. After all, a $1 increase in
oil prices costs U.S. customers an estimated $2 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this sorry record, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman
of the Armed Services Committee, has suggested that Hussein and his
commanders would be less likely to use weapons of mass destruction if
an international coalition was standing against him.</TE>
<TE>   The senator ought to know better.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the coalition warfare model led Hussein to escalate the
fighting. He fired Scud missiles into Israel in a calculated attempt
to draw the Israelis into the war and thus wreck what the Iraqis
termed "the 30-nation aggression."</TE>
<TE>   This strategy was hardly farfetched. Hussein understood that the
Arab participation was meant to contain U.S. war goals.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Hafez Assad, then Syria's president, put so many
conditions on his joining the coalition that the Syrian contingent
went virtually unused. In the single instance that it engaged in a
military operation, Syrian artillery intentionally overshot its
assigned targets.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, for this gallant effort Assad was paid $2 billion by
the Saudis, which he promptly used to buy Scud missiles and two
missile factories from North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   If Syrian Scuds ever hit U.S. regional targets or Israeli cities,
it will be thanks to the coalition warfare model of the Gulf War.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>BRUCE HERSCHENSOHN</AU>
<BD>Bruce Herschensohn teaches foreign policy at the
Pepperdine University School of Public Policy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have lived in Los Angeles since the early 1940s. For the last 18 of
those years I have lived in Hollywood. I think.</LD>
<LD>   The reason that I am unsure is because the borders of Hollywood
have always been disputed. There's a new map now, and it looks like
I'm included, but a lot of people don't like the new map. It depends
on whom you talk to.</LD>
<LD>   I generally believe that the best government is the one that is
closest to the people. That philosophy made me, instinctively,
sympathetic to the secession of Hollywood, to be voted on in
November. I probably would be in favor of Hollywood's secession if
Hollywood were a place with sharp boundaries and a defined
population. But it isn't. And it never has been.</LD>
<TE>   "Hollywood" is the name of a fantasy of laughter and tears and
romance and dreams and happy endings. Hollywood is directors and
writers and musicians and singers and dancers and actors from Clark
Gable and Marilyn Monroe to Tom Cruise and Britney Spears, and few of
them have inhabited or worked in the geographical entity defined on
the ballot. The artists of Hollywood more often lived in Bel-Air or
Malibu or Beverly Hills or Encino or, yes, even Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Even most of the Hollywood movie studios aren't in Hollywood. The
old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, now Sony Pictures, is in Culver City.
The old 20th Century Fox was mainly in what is now Century City.
Paramount Pictures and the old studios of RKO Radio Pictures are
probably in Hollywood, but there has been some argument about that.</TE>
<TE>   Leave well enough alone. Hollywood gets along extremely well with
its honorary mayor, Johnny Grant, who is known throughout the world
and captains Hollywood for what it is: a magnificent, distinctive and
appealing idea that is becoming as glamorous as its name implies.</TE>
<TE>   Within the last few years, the business section of Hollywood
Boulevard has been undergoing a metamorphosis without bureaucratic
governing. Grauman's Chinese Theatre, with its forecourt of
handprints and footprints, has been renovated to live up to its
reputation, and the Walk of Fame has taken on a significance that
identifies the people who created the legend of the Hollywood name.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood is a place with people who have talent, imagination and
passion. Those dream-makers should not have to endure a governmental
bureaucracy. Those who consider themselves Hollywoodians wouldn't
understand such bureaucracy, and Hollywood doesn't need one. Unless
we want Hollywood to be like any other place. I live there, and I
don't.</TE>

<HD>In Era of Broken Rules, Society Breaks</HD>
<DH>'Make 'em up as you go along' just doesn't work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN CHARLES RAUL</AU>
<BD>Alan Charles Raul is a Washington lawyer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rules are for chumps. That was obviously the prevailing ethos (if you
can call it that) of the Tyco and Enron plutocrats and their
enablers. And likewise for the sticky-fingered Sen. Robert Torricelli
(D-N.J.), who apparently also saw his opportunities and took 'em.</LD>
<LD>   But so too for the New Jersey Supreme Court. No small-minded rules
were going to stand in the way of letting those jurists mete out
justice. They replaced Torricelli on the Nov. 5 ballot with former
Democratic Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg on the theory that, well, just
because the state Legislature allowed substitutions only up to 51
days before the election didn't mean the court couldn't allow 33 days
instead.</LD>
<LD>   But New Jersey is hardly the only court to take the "rule" out of
the rule of law. In the case involving handicapped golfer Casey
Martin's use of a golf cart, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to toss
out the PGA Tour's rules and make its own instead. Justice Antonin
Scalia, dissenting, said Congress did not authorize "misty-eyed
judicial supervision of such a revolution" of the rules of
competition.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1990s, of course, there was a revolution in the business
realm. None of the old rules about stock markets and valuation held
up. Even dress codes didn't survive the decade. And a lot of
executive suites ended up pushing "business casual" well beyond the
loss of suits and ties. During the dot-com era, with its unreal
market caps, billion-dollar options and glorification of the
unconventional, how could you expect corporate executives to act more
than "relatively" honestly?</TE>
<TE>   Rules were for chumps.</TE>
<TE>   After all, if an openly lying U.S. president could just about get
away with it, why shouldn't everybody else go for it too?</TE>
<TE>   How did all this happen?</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, Harvard theologian Joseph Fletcher materially advanced
the end of a rules-based society by writing an important book of
philosophy called "Situation Ethics: The New Morality." In it, he
elaborated a morality without rules; in short, moral relativism. Not
quite "whatever feels good," but close.</TE>
<TE>   Then Thomas A. Harris popularized the ideas of Eric Berne in the
fabulously successful "I'm OK--You're OK," which exalted
self-realization and rationalized self-indulgence.</TE>
<TE>   There was also the Vietnam War's destruction of the social fabric
and the free-love generation's assault on authority figures, social
conventions and bourgeois rules of behavior.</TE>
<TE>   In a nutshell, self-gratification beat out self-discipline, and it
was only a matter of time before codes of personal conduct and the
rule of law would be corrupted by fuzzy, "situational" thinking.</TE>
<TE>   There was one place that publicly bucked the trend. In New York
City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani--aided by Police Commissioner William
J. Bratton--attacked such "quality of life" crimes as graffiti,
aggressive panhandling and turnstile jumping.</TE>
<TE>   Were these as bad as murder or assault? Of course not. But
enforcing rules, even petty ones, fosters a culture of compliance.
Rules, ritual and tradition help keep our baser selves in check.</TE>
<TE>   Rules, though, need keepers. They used to be the judges, lawyers,
accountants and, most important, parents. Now, all of us have fallen
down on the job. We have relied too much on legal enforcement to
maintain the social order and not enough on old-fashioned
self-discipline reinforced by social stigma.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we can make some headway against greedy individualism by
refocusing on good manners, rehabilitating some minor social rules
and getting people back into the habit of complying with them.
Getting rid of "business casual" is my vote for a good place to
start. It may not prevent the next Enron, but it can't hurt until we
think of something better.</TE>

<HD>Love's Road Is Bumpy, Even When It's High-Tech</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a New York writer. Her Web site:

<DL></DL>
<LD>Placing or answering a personal ad used to be a cause for shame. If
you did it, you did it on the sly and lied about it. More often,
though, you ridiculed the very idea, reading aloud the back pages of
your local free weekly with the same campy tone of condescension that
you reserved for the dirty parts of pulp novels. And there was a good
reason for such disdain. Advertising for love represents the nadir of
the romantic ideal, the cynical commodification of that most precious
and mysterious of human emotions. The stigma surrounding such ads was
justified.</LD>
<TE>   But now that stigma is gone, or so the proliferation of high-tech
personals on the Web would seem to suggest, and that has led to the
kind of debased and panting free-for-all that makes good
old-fashioned promiscuity look quaint. The Internet has ushered in a
brassy new world of dial-up, free-market romance that far outstrips
its clunky and geeky predecessor, the computer date. Personal ads are
infinitely more sophisticated than they used to be. Most now come
with color pictures, detailed profiles and instant messaging
capabilities. And people are placing them in far greater numbers.
What's more, they're doing so with exhibitionistic abandon,
consenting to have their mugs and foibles beamed around the globe via
the Web sites of publications like Salon, the Onion, LA Weekly, Jane
and Time Out New York. Each day, some new ripe and marketable face
appears, complete with a quirky teaser dripping with hip innuendo,
until you begin to wonder whatever happened to the joys of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The brains behind the blitzkrieg is Spring Street Networks, which
has made a business of repackaging personal ads and selling them to
publications whose audiences fit the sought-after demographic: young,
savvy, cool. Spring Street Chairman Rufus Griscom says the personals
account for 50% of the income of Spring Street parent Nerve.com and
probably a considerable portion of subscriber publications' incomes
as well. Love for sale, anyone? Add money, money, money, plus a lot
of desperate people and the technological know-how to sell the
bejesus out of their insecurities, and you get the "catch of the day"
following you through the ether with his virtual fly open.</TE>
<TE>   Spring Street Vice President Brian Battjer ascribes the company's
success to something he calls the "credit-based" model of personal
advertising. Users browse ads free but have to buy credits to send
messages to the irresistible "hottie" who, they've just learned,
happens to be online at this very moment. Contact happens and the
register goes cha-ching! as the users buy more credits to keep up the
badinage.</TE>
<TE>   More people are meeting their dates and mates online, which seems
like a good thing on the surface. Epistolary romance is making a
comeback, as are the staid courtship rituals that went with it.
Instead of jumping into bed with someone they met in a pickup joint,
people are learning about each other's childhoods, likes and dislikes
and even personal habits long before they meet. But then comes the
kicker. All too often, people fall in love with what has been
hyperbolized in cyberspace and inevitably are disappointed when they
meet their keyboard pals face to face.</TE>
<TE>   How could it be otherwise? Some real and lasting encounters happen
but with the same frequency as they happen in real life: rarely.
Blanketing the Internet with your psychosexual resume may get you
more dates, but it isn't going to change the brutal odds of true
love.</TE>

<LD>Hoover Dam in the 1930s and the State Water Project in the 1960s,
traditional water projects with massive dams and aqueducts, were once
hallmarks of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California,
the giant water wholesaler to the region. Now, with no more big
rivers to dam and with water demands rising, the water district is
developing untraditional sources and partnerships to bring water to
the urbanized desert. This creativity is good, but public ownership
of water supplies cannot be compromised.</LD>
<LD>   The district has been a pioneer. In the mid-1980s it paid for
water-saving projects in Imperial Irrigation District farmlands--such
as lining canals to stop leakage--and got for urban use the water
that was saved. "Met," as the Metropolitan Water District is known,
has been ahead in storing water underground in wet years for use in
dry times.</LD>
<LD>   A Metropolitan project in conjunction with a private company,
Cadiz, was hailed in 1997 as a prototype public-private venture:
Business gathers and perhaps stores the water, then sells it to the
public agency. But after years of study and controversy, this
proposed experiment had too many nagging problems. The district's
37-member board did the right thing in killing the project Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Cadiz, run by entrepreneur Keith Brackpool, owns a 35,000-acre
ranch in the Mojave Desert, sitting atop an underground aquifer
formed over centuries. Cadiz proposed a 35-mile-long pipeline to link
the ranch with Met's California Aqueduct, which already carries
Colorado River water to the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   In wet years, Met would divert surplus river water to Cadiz and
store it underground. Additionally, and most critically, Cadiz would
sell aquifer water as well, enough for up to 100,000 households. The
company said it could remove that much a year without harming the
desert's fragile plant and animal life, but others challenged such
claims in regulatory proceedings. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)
came out in vigorous opposition this year.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool may not have been helped by his friendship with Gov.
Gray Davis and wooing of legislators. And it appeared that Met might
not have much surplus water to store at Cadiz because California will
have to cut back on its take of the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   The failure of Cadiz does not mean there is no role for private
companies in water trading and marketing. But the water belongs to
the people of California. Government agencies must be certain that
however water is traded, diverted or manipulated, the public interest
remains the highest priority.</TE>

<HD>The Wrong Resolution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The resolution Congress passed early today authorizing the use of
military force against Iraq gives too much power to this and,
potentially, future presidents to attack nations unilaterally based
on mere suspicions.</LD>
<LD>   This could fundamentally change the nation's approach to foreign
policy. It could also, as Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) observed this week,
"have ramifications for the future of the world, because other
countries will adopt this same philosophy." A preemptive strike
against Iraq could spring open a Pandora's box of aggression. Russia
could cite it to crush insurgents in Georgia. India could use it to
justify a nuclear strike to prevent Pakistan from such an attack.</LD>
<LD>   When John Quincy Adams declared that America "goes not abroad, in
search of monsters to destroy," he articulated a doctrine that has
served the nation well. In two world wars and the Cold War, the
United States could pride itself on acting defensively. America did
not seek out evil; evil sought out America.</LD>
<TE>   History has also shown the risks of straying from this policy of
restraint. Because Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in
1964, giving President Lyndon B. Johnson the power to send more
troops to Vietnam, many thousands of young Americans died in a war
the nation ultimately lost. In that case, legislators could
legitimately say the White House had misled them. Today Congress has
no such excuse.</TE>
<TE>   Though shorn of the original resolution's more sweeping language,
the measure approved by Congress is clear. It expands presidents'
powers and undercuts Adams' doctrine of defense. On Thursday, Sen.
Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) warned: "We have said historically we are a
defensive nation. This new foreign policy ... is a dramatic departure
from that.... I beg and caution my colleagues to think twice about
that."</TE>
<TE>   It is to the nation's credit that the quality of debate in
Congress matched the gravity of the occasion. The public's reasoned
unease about heading into war seems to have prompted President Bush's
turn toward caution and new emphasis on the role of the United
Nations and an international coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the resolution has passed, Congress and the American
people should urge the president to interpret his mandate narrowly.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48
hours of any military action against Iraq and to submit at least
every 80 days a report to Congress about any  campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Alamo) reflected the judicious approach
to that requirement when she said she expected Bush "to provide clear
plans for military engagement that explain our military strategy,
detail where our troops will be based, report to Congress on his
efforts to secure international assistance, protect us against
simultaneous threats from other parts of the world and define plans
for Iraq after Saddam."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush would be wise to do everything possible to avoid ever
reaching that point. Neither the United States nor any other nation
can be sure it is safe until Saddam Hussein opens every inch of Iraq
to weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   If the president can get the U.N. Security Council to pass a tough
new demand for unlimited probes, backed by an unequivocal threat of
force by many nations' armies, the United States would avoid ever
testing the radical new doctrine of unilateral, preventive first
strikes.</TE>
<TE>   The world has indeed changed since Sept. 11, 2001. Iraq must be
disarmed. But even the new terrorist threats should not panic this
nation into abandoning one of its guiding principles.</TE>

<LD>Wait a minute! Yet another U.S. Senate candidate, this time a Montana
Republican facing poor polling numbers, has withdrawn deep in the
race. Silly us. We thought the election was Nov. 5. This may save
concession speech time on election night, but it's disturbing because
that state party could try to substitute a more popular candidate, as
New Jersey Democrats successfully did when their incumbent suffered
from a scandal. As a democracy, we have filing deadlines. They vary
by state, but all demand compliance.</LD>
<LD>   New Jersey Democrats substituted a retired senator after the
deadline, and the courts, confronting the possibility of a blank line
on the ballot for an important office, approved. The New Jersey case
seemed an aberration then.</LD>
<LD>   Politically, it is tempting to change horses three weeks before
likely defeat. Would some California Republicans like to slip former
Mayor Richard Riordan into the gubernatorial contest today to replace
the trailing Bill Simon Jr.? But that ignores rules and subverts
citizen participation through the flawed but official primary process
and absentee voting well underway.</LD>
<TE>   Montana's Mike Taylor, Republican challenger to Sen. Max Baucus,
blamed his sudden withdrawal on a new Democratic Party ad that Taylor
and state human rights advocates said appealed to homophobes. Though
Baucus, chairman of the powerful Finance Committee, seemed vulnerable
last year, Taylor, a state senator, trailed badly in recent polls,
54% to 35%. Montana's ballot deadline is long passed; write-ins may
file up to 15 days before the election. Maneuvers such as last-minute
dropouts and write-ins have effects beyond any immediate race. Lack
of a candidate or the sudden appearance of a more popular one can
drastically affect voter turnout and thus all races and referendums.</TE>
<TE>   New technology should enable states to ponder later filing
deadlines. Great, let's talk. But no party should be able to
substitute candidates this late to seek a better result. For now,
let's apply the same rules to everyone.</TE>

<LD>Re "Priests Stand Up to Cardinal on Budget," Oct. 8: I have been
arrested twice for protesting the gross expense of Cardinal Roger
Mahony's new cathedral (climbing his bell tower and occupying his
bulldozer), and I'm delighted to hear the priests speaking up for the
needs of our struggling sisters and brothers of color, the
incarcerated and their victims, gays and lesbians and those in need
of religious education.</LD>
<LD>   Not telling the regional bishops about this pending financial
crisis and announcing decentralization without any plan to hand over
ministries is irresponsible. Sounds like someone wants a thousand
points of unpaid light.</LD>
<LD>   As a church we try to form community, with all its ups and downs.
We seek to figure out how to share our resources; to make sure no one
has too much, and no one has too little. We tend to the needs of the
suffering before ourselves. We pray together, reflect on the word,
break bread and wish one another God's peace. We proclaim that
message to the world, primarily by how we act.</LD>
<TE>   The cathedral is a hollow sign until the cardinal leaves the cozy
fund-raisers, gets out of that comfortable chair on the altar and
personally practices the works of mercy and justice by serving the
poor.</TE>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. David O'Connell stated that Cardinal Mahony gave reasons for
axing key ministries in the archdiocese, but "didn't feel the pain."
Narcissists rarely, if ever, feel the pain of others. Hopefully, the
political pressures of the priests and laity will reverse some of
Mahony's bad decisions.</TE>

<LD>We desperately need new schools. However, I am going to vote against
Measure K, the current school bond on the ballot. It seems that all
the Los Angeles Unified School District has managed to build in
recent times are one Belmont project and seven private bathrooms. I
have no confidence that it can actually build schools.</LD>
<LD>   The school district already has more than $500 million for
building schools. Let the LAUSD show us first what it can do with all
this money, before it asks for more.</LD>

<LD>Re "Stalin's Bash Doesn't Hold a Candle," Oct. 8: The article's
description of a few of the extravagant gifts received by President
Vladimir Putin at his 50th birthday party in Moscow was certainly
noteworthy. As a college professor who occasionally writes for
publications, I appreciated especially the gift of three pages of
text by the former deputy prime minister of the Russian republic of
Bashkortostan. This text, addressed to Putin, was composed solely of
words beginning with the letter P and ended with praise: "Po Planete
postavyat pamyatniki Pervomy Prezidentu Planety Putinu" (All around
the planet they will put up monuments to the first president of the
planet, Putin).</LD>
<LD>   I have heard more than once during my four visits to Russia in the
past two years that Putin's extravagance is not so well appreciated
by the average Russian. I suggest that any future article that
pertains to Putin's stature as president of Russia be worded
something like this: Paradoxical, perpetually poor publicity
professing President Putin's popularity predicates perjurious pride.
Or should I have worded this in Russian?</LD>

<LD>Re "Truth on Iraq Seeps Through," by Robert Scheer, Commentary, Oct.
8: It is important to keep in mind a little-remembered news item of
June 16. As reported by the New York Times, it read: "Classified
investigations of the Al Qaeda threat now underway at the FBI and CIA
have concluded that the war in Afghanistan failed to diminish the
threat to the United States. Instead, the war might have complicated
counterterrorism efforts by dispersing potential attackers across a
wider geographic area."</LD>
<LD>   If President Bush's first war to make us safe did no such thing,
what can we expect of the second? And of those that will inevitably
follow? Time has proved that Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland) was the
only one who got it right the first time.</LD>
<LD>   Offering the president carte blanche is a bad idea.</LD>
<TE>   Silvio Levy</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer's latest attempt to discredit Bush exposes more truths
about Scheer than about Bush. This is one reader who is sick and
tired of reading Scheer's acerbic attacks on Bush. Scheer and all of
his anti-Bush pals are opposed to a U.S. "invasion" of Iraq. So am I.
I haven't heard Bush even mention the word.</TE>
<TE>   What I heard Bush request was a resolution from Congress
authorizing the use of force to enforce a new U.N. resolution
requiring unfettered inspections in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   What's wrong with that? Is Scheer afraid that Bush will prove that
he is a great leader?</TE>
<TE>   Richard Keck</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's edition, a letter and floor-debate excerpts from
Rep. Tom Lantos and Rep. Dan Burton each state or imply that opposing
an invasion of Iraq is equivalent to appeasing Hitler in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   These three men get the lesson of history backward. The failure of
Neville Chamberlain and other appeasers was to tolerate the
unilateral invasion of one sovereign nation by another, stronger one.
Bush is claiming that the Sept. 11 terrorists successfully changed
the hard-learned international standard that unilateral attacks on
other nations are intolerable. Iraq is just one on the president's
list of "evil" countries. He claims the United States should not be
subject to the standards of an international criminal court.</TE>
<TE>   To fail to oppose Bush's planned invasion of Iraq is to fail to
have learned the lesson of what's wrong with appeasement.</TE>
<TE>   Guy Webster</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One can't help wondering if Bush's analysts have figured out
whether the risk of a terrorist attack on the U.S. or its citizens
will be increased or decreased by going to war with Iraq. It could be
that a war with Iraq is at cross purposes and counterproductive with
our current war on terrorism. An increase in terrorist recruits and
the possibility of a religious-based conflict are more dangerous than
any threat of nuclear weapons use.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Seeks State Funds for Planned Great Park</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Irvine Wants State Taxpayers to Fund Big Park," Oct. 8: So the
good citizens of Irvine decline to build an airport on the closed El
Toro Marine base but ask that taxpayers from around the state help
build the park and museums they prefer to a regional airport. On the
face of it, this is a blatantly self-serving strategy: decline to
assist in accommodating the needs of the same air traffic to which
they themselves contribute, but expect others to finance the open
space and cultural resources "in their own backyard."</LD>
<LD>   However, the self-serving may go deeper. If this travesty of
funding does slip through on the coattails of Proposition 51, does
anyone want to guess how Irvine will view out-of-area visitors to
"their" park? Perhaps, as yet another source of the same congestion
they claimed as a reason to reject an airport?</LD>
<LD>   Elizabeth Shadish</LD>
<TE>   Gardena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Talk about chutzpah! First, Irvine opposes sharing future problems
of air congestion at LAX. Then it has the temerity to ask the entire
state to build an outdoor park for its over-privileged area.
Evidently the residents have not heard about crises in education,
health and transportation. If Irvine residents want this park, let
them pay for it out of local taxes. No on Proposition 51.</TE>

<LD>Quite possibly the most moronic and self-defeating phenomenon in
politics today is the Green Party. These seem like people who remain
relentlessly confident that biting off your nose to spite your face
is progressive politics. After successfully giving us George W.
Bush's victory in the last election (Ralph: Do you still think that
there's no difference between Bush and Al Gore?) they have set their
sights on a new debacle--eliminating Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone.
This is despite the fact that Wellstone is possibly the most
left-wing and environmentally friendly candidate in American politics
and that the Democratic Senate majority is a razor-thin one seat.</LD>
<LD>   One might understand the persistence of the Green Party if its
candidates had a snowball in hell's chance of winning, but they
don't. The difference between a parliamentary system of government,
such as is found in Germany, and our winner-take-all system seems
vastly beyond their intellect.</LD>
<LD>   I consider myself a left-wing environmentalist--the natural
constituency of the Greens, and indeed I used to be a financial
supporter of them. But I now despise them. They are a cancer on
progressive politics.</LD>

<HD>Farm Bill Could Slow Population Growth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' signing of the mandatory mediation bill gives farm
workers a better shot at fair pay and working conditions (Oct. 3).
Too, it may have another good but unforeseen consequence: a reduction
of our population growth pressures. Growers have consistently opposed
effective controls on their sources of cheap immigrant labor. If farm
workers can improve their lot, it will make the work more attractive
to our unemployed poor people, about whom we repeatedly hear that
they won't take the tough field jobs. Some surely will want the work,
if pay and conditions improve. Thus a start for them on an upward
ladder and a move off the welfare rolls.</LD>
<LD>   The corollary consequence may be that growers will see less need
to push politicians to free up immigration. And, since immigration is
about two-thirds of U.S. population growth, we could realize some of
the many benefits of slower population growth. Politicians of both
parties seem averse to talking about our overpopulation, despite
polls showing that many people consider it one of our biggest
problems. This new mediation legislation may be an indirect way of
lessening the need to stick their political necks out.</LD>

<LD>Re Enrique's journey from Honduras (Sept. 29-Oct. 7): Gut-wrenching
poverty, starvation and cruel exploitation brought Enrique and his
mother before him to this country. Many who worry they will be
deprived of their abundance feel we shouldn't have to share this
great country with starving foreigners.</LD>
<LD>   This is the same way the Indians felt when the starving Europeans
landed in North America and asked, then demanded that the Indians
share their corn, squash and beans with them. It's the same old story
of the comfortable not wanting to be disturbed by those less
fortunate. The more things change, the more they stay the same.</LD>

risk in trying to reach family here, and perhaps in the process,
appreciate more about what we have in our country and take less for
granted.</TE>

<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas has canceled a new policy
that allowed his staff to use money earmarked for law enforcement
activities to buy food and alcohol for lobbyists and lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   The action, which Rackauckas outlined in a letter to Orange County
Chief Executive Officer Michael Schumacher, comes three months after
he created the rules in response to a grand jury report.</LD>
<LD>   That report criticized the district attorney for permitting the
practice even though it violated county rules.</LD>
<TE>   County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who had been critical of the
alcohol expenses, praised Rackauckas for his action but implored him
to reimburse the county for alcohol his employees purchased during
lobbying meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the D.A. finally got it right," Spitzer said. "He's
acknowledged he's going to comply with county policy, but he still
has an obligation to reimburse the county [for alcohol expenses].
That's an improper use of taxpayer funds."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Rackauckas issued a written statement saying the
district attorney would not comment for this article.</TE>
<TE>   In his memo to Schumacher, Rackauckas said his employees will now
act "in accordance with county policy," which prohibits employees
from billing the county for alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   The memo said lobbying expenses will be billed to the office's
general fund, not the special witness fund.</TE>
<TE>   The spending became an issue for Rackauckas over the summer when
the Orange County Grand Jury issued a report that questioned the more
than $4,700 his chief investigator billed the county for food and
alcohol during meetings with lawmakers, lobbyists and others.</TE>
<TE>   The money came from a fund used for witness protection, meetings
with informants and expenses related to undercover investigations.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors allocated $90,000 for the fund in last year's
budget.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury noted that a 1994 office policy prohibited
employees from using the fund for anything other than law enforcement
expenses, such as witness protection and undercover operations.</TE>
<TE>   While the panel recommended that Rackauckas enforce the 1994
rules, he instead changed the policy to allow the fund to be used for
lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Schumacher and county counsel Benjamin de Mayo
had pressed Rackauckas for explanations about his policy for alcohol
purchases, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a violation of county policy. It's a clear rule and everyone
knows it," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher said he was satisfied with Rackauckas' actions.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney has told me in writing the way he plans to
handle the payment of costs for legislative activities. I have
confidence that's how he will proceed," Schumacher said.</TE>
<TE>   But the policy reversal was not enough to satisfy some of
Rackauckas' critics.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County government watchdog Bill Mitchell, former chairman
of the county's Common Cause chapter, said Rackauckas should
discipline those who violated the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the message for the public when this individual is allowed
to bend and break the rules?" Mitchell asked.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in California, district attorneys have similar funds but
do not allow the money to be used for lobbying. Instead, they use
county lobbyists or other funds.</TE>

<LD>The leader of one of Compton's oldest street gangs has pleaded guilty
to federal charges that he headed a massive cocaine ring, eliminating
the need for a trial that was scheduled to begin this week.</LD>
<LD>   Frederick Staves, 39, leader of the Santana Block Crips, entered
his plea Tuesday. He faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years
or a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.</LD>
<LD>   Staves and three other defendants, who also pleaded guilty
Tuesday, are scheduled to be sentenced in January, according to a
statement from the U.S. attorney's office. The pleas capped a
two-year, multi-agency investigation that netted 40 pounds of
cocaine, a quarter-million dollars in cash, and cars and guns, the
statement said.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Administrators at Antelope Valley Hospital must recognize the
card-style ballots submitted by registered nurses who are considering
union representation, according to a decision issued this week by an
administrative law judge.</LD>
<LD>   In May, a majority of nurses at the 350-bed hospital submitted
cards indicating that they wished to be represented by the California
Nurses Assn., CNA spokeswoman Beth Kean said. The hospital's board of
directors, however, maintained that a secret ballot election was
necessary.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Donn Ginoza, an administrative law judge with the
state's Public Employment Relations Board, ruled that the hospital
must recognize the cards. Ginoza said a new state law permitting such
elections overrides a local rule calling for a secret ballot vote.</LD>
<TE>   Hospital officials have not decided if they will appeal the
ruling, spokesman Ed Callahan said.</TE>

<LD>A state appeals court Thursday gave the developers of Playa Vista the
go-ahead once again to work on widening a stretch of Culver
Boulevard. The day before, two appellate judges had ordered the work
temporarily halted so they could consider a lower court's decision to
let the work proceed.</LD>
<LD>   Wetlands proponents earlier sought an injunction to halt the work,
which they say is destroying habitat. The injunction was sought by a
Sierra Club task force in a suit against the state Coastal Commission
and Playa Vista.</LD>
<LD>   All work on the project must cease on Tuesday, the
state-designated start of the rainy season, which lasts until March
30.</LD>

<LD>Sheriff's deputies returned to an isolated oil field Thursday to
search for the body of a woman reported missing more than 13 months
ago by her husband, who has since been charged with her murder.</LD>
<LD>   But after spending nine hours combing the oil field, officials
ended the search without finding the body of Lakewood resident Jana
Carpenter-Koklich, the 41-year-old daughter of the late state Sen.
Paul Carpenter.</LD>
<LD>   She was reported missing April 20, 2001. Her husband, Bruce
Koklich, a 43-year-old real estate executive, is scheduled to go on
trial next month. He was charged with his wife's death after traces
of her blood were found in their home and in her abandoned sport
utility vehicle.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff's Lt. Ray Peavy said there were no new leads in the case.</TE>

<HD>3 Condors Are Released in Wilds of Baja California</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in a generation, California condors are flying
free over Mexico after three of the giant birds were released
Thursday in a mountainous region of Baja California.</LD>
<LD>   It took two days for the trio to leave their flight pen and soar
above the pine forests of the Sierra San Pedro de Martir National
Park, which rises to 9,000 feet.</LD>
<LD>   Two other condors, North America's largest birds, will be freed in
the next few weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a biological and symbolic significance here," said Mike
Wallace, who heads the San Diego-based condor recovery team. "These
birds haven't been seen in this area since the 1930s, when they were
lost to shooting and poisoning."</TE>
<TE>   "Although condors were common in the first half of the last
century, these magnificent birds are unknown to the younger
generation," said Horacio de la Cueva of the Baja condor project.</TE>
<TE>   "Our education plans aim to teach both about the biology of this
bird and the global importance of environmental conservation in Baja
California."</TE>

gutted a sprawling home under construction on Island Vista in Newport
Coast. The 8,200-square-foot home had been under construction for
about three years and was only about two months from completion,
according to its owners. The loss was estimated at $3 million. The
cause of the fire is being investigated. There were no injuries in
the blaze, which broke out about 10:45 p.m. Wednesday.</CP>

than four decades who played a leading role in the cleanup of the
Exxon Valdez oil spill, has died. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Evison, who later headed the Grand Teton Natural History Assn.,
died Oct. 4 of cancer at his daughter's home in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   In a 42-year career with the Park Service, Evison was known for
his strong advocacy of conservation and environmental education, and
offered an articulate vision of the role of national parks in
American society.</LD>
<TE>   "Evison is considered to be one of the greatest and most
influential leaders of the National Park Service," Karen Wade,
intermountain regional director of the National Park Service, told
the Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune. She said he "touched the lives of
thousands of National Park Service employees and influenced the
overall management of the entire national park system and its service
to 280 million annual visitors."</TE>
<TE>   Evison served as superintendent or interim superintendent of
Saguaro National Monument in Tucson, Sequoia-Kings Canyon National
Park, Grand Canyon National Park and Great Smoky Mountains National
Park. He also held the post of assistant director for park operations
in Washington, D.C. In 1978, he was offered the position of director
of the National Park Service, but he declined it to go to
Sequoia-Kings Canyon as superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the 1980s, he was based in Alaska as regional director
of the National Park Service. While there, he helped lead the cleanup
of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington, D.C., native earned his bachelor's degree in
forestry and wildlife management from Colorado A &amp; M in 1954 and a
master's degree in environmental communications from the University
of Wisconsin. He began working with the Park Service as a fire
control aide in Grand Teton National Park and moved into the
permanent ranks as a ranger in Petrified Forest National Park in
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from the Park Service in 1994, he became executive
director of the Grand Teton Natural History Assn., where he was
credited with expanding scientific and educational programs.</TE>
<TE>   "He ... believed in the power of remembrance, saying that it was
important that people take from any of our national parks a vivid
memory that might fuel interest in their own public lands," said Jan
Lynch, acting executive director of the Grand Teton Natural History
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his daughter Kathy, he is survived by his wife,
Barbara; a son, Chris; and two grandchildren. A memorial service is
scheduled for Nov. 13 at Grand Teton National Park.</TE>

<HD>Administration May Cut Klamath's Flow Again</HD>
<DH>Water: Indian groups and environmentalists say plan to end
a temporary increase in the river's level could further devastate
fall salmon runs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration pushed ahead Thursday to cut back flows on
the Klamath River, prompting angry predictions that the action could
wreak havoc on fall salmon runs already hit hard by a die-off that
claimed as many as 30,000 fish last month.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of salmon and the Indian tribes that rely on them for
food and jobs said the actions by Bush bureaucrats are further
evidence that the administration favors farmers with its water
policies.</LD>
<LD>   A collection of tribes, commercial fishermen and environmentalists
are predicting that many surviving salmon or their eggs could be
stranded as the river's flow is cut by almost a third in the coming
days.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm angry, and I'm frustrated," said Sue Masten, chairwoman of
the Yurok tribe, which depends on the river, which slices from Oregon
into Northern California, emptying on the coast near Crescent City.
"The Bush administration could get another black eye over this."</TE>
<TE>   Masten and others had hoped federal water officials would maintain
the river at its current level by drawing from two reservoirs--Gerber
in Oregon and Clear Lake in California--that have yet to be tapped to
help bolster the low flows in the troubled Klamath.</TE>
<TE>   Federal water officials and local groups have been fighting for
more than a decade over water from the river. The Klamath must
support not only salmon, including one endangered species, the coho,
but upriver farmers who want the water for irrigation and downriver
users who fish the Klamath.</TE>
<TE>   But federal officials--saying they are still grappling over what
exactly caused the massive die-off of salmon last month on the
river--contend no easy solution is in sight.</TE>
<TE>   They say taking water from the two reservoirs might not prevent
more salmon deaths--because the water might be too warm to help the
fish.</TE>
<TE>   When fish began turning up dead in late September to a combination
of bacterial and protozoa infections, the Bush administration faced
accusations that too much river water was diverted this summer to
help farmers upstream. The dearth of water raised water temperatures
and harmed the fish, critics said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal water officials responded within days by hiking the river
flows. But they said that "pulse flow" would only last about two
weeks, because of concerns it would draw down Upper Klamath Lake,
creating a whole new set of problems for two species of endangered
sucker fish in the Oregon lake.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Ellen Wooldridge, an Interior Department deputy director, said
Thursday it is unclear whether tapping Clear Lake or Gerber Reservoir
would do more harm than good.</TE>
<TE>   Water from those reservoirs, she said, might be too warm for the
fish. She cited a report issued last March by the National Research
Council suggesting that warm water--not lower flows--could prove the
chief culprit for fish losses on the Klamath.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunately more complicated than just saying fish need
more water," Wooldridge said. "What they need is good, quality
water."</TE>
<TE>   Tribal leaders and commercial fishermen rejected suggestions that
diverting water from the two reservoirs would prove futile. Instead,
they suggested that the Bush administration was once again doing what
was best for farmers, rather than the fish, including endangered coho
salmon.</TE>
<TE>   But farmers worry that drawing off those two reservoirs could
create a water shortage in eastern stretches of the Klamath Basin if
the coming winter proves dry. Irrigators admit that the two
reservoirs are among the hardest hit in dry years.</TE>
<TE>   Glen Spain of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Assns.
said it is a sad example of the Bush Administration playing politics.</TE>
<TE>   "The farmers get what they want," he said, "and we get a river
full of dead fish."</TE>
<TE>   Angry members of several tribes--the Yurok, Hoopa, Karuk and
Klamath--were planning to gather at federal offices in Klamath Falls,
Ore., to protest the water cutback on the river, which is key part of
their cultural and economic heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot afford to take another hit," said Masten, noting that
the Yurok have suspending fishing to ensure more salmon make it
upstream.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people depend on that fishery for our way of life. We can't
afford to stand by any longer."</TE>
<TE>   Biologists at the California Department of Fish and Game contend
low river flows combined with hot summer weather caused salmon to
delay their migration up the Klamath. The crowding of the fish
together helped disease spread quickly.</TE>
<TE>   With the increased flows of the last two weeks, many of the
surviving fish have moved upstream.</TE>
<TE>   But several new threats lurk, biologists say. As flows decrease,
disease could spread anew among adult fish. Eggs laid in
gravel-strewn eddies could be left high and dry, meanwhile, as the
water recedes.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, as the river narrows, fish would be forced to spawn in
deeper sections where heavy winter flows could scour the bottom,
destroying their nests of eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, fish just making their way into the river--including
the fragile coho salmon, a species threatened by extinction on the
Klamath--could be blocked from entering creeks and tributaries where
they spawn.</TE>
<TE>   One such tributary, the Scott River, is already essentially walled
off by cobbles at its juncture with the Klamath.</TE>

<HD>Angels Are Rushing to Get Their House in Order by Tonight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consider planning major league baseball's version of a wedding for
45,000 guests. Throw in a dose of uncertainty, the usual first-time
jitters and figure the whole event will be documented by about 600
journalists and viewed by millions across the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Don't forget decorations, fireworks, entertainment and food. These
are just some of the details that staff of the Anaheim Angels and
Edison International Field are rushing to complete before the
American League Championship Series against the Minnesota Twins
resumes tonight with the first of three games in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   "We're absolutely ramped up," said Robert Alvarado, the Angels'
marketing and promotions director. "We're working a mile a minute to
get things done."</LD>
<TE>   Alvarado is trying to arm every fan with a pair of inflatable, red
plastic ThunderStix to slap together. That would be easy if the
Angels had a warehouse full of the noisemakers. But these were
ordered only after the Angels upset the Yankees, and the ThunderStix
are coming from China--a distinct problem considering the 10-day
lockout at the Los Angeles-Long Beach ports that has had cargo backed
up for days.</TE>
<TE>   "You've heard of the slow boat from China?" Alvarado said. "We
didn't want to risk it. Our vendor is actually hand-delivering them.
He's getting on a freight plane, flying into LAX, coming straight
here on Friday. We're barely going to make our window."</TE>
<TE>   Those are just the freebies. Tim Fisk, general manager of Facility
Merchandising Inc. can barely keep the team store stocked. He even
had to have a new service counter built to accommodate more cash
registers.</TE>
<TE>   Rally monkeys are the hottest seller--roughly 5,000 were purchased
during the two home playoff games against the Yankees. Now there is a
whole new collection of playoff T-shirts, caps, baseballs, pins and
pennants.</TE>
<TE>   "As fast as they unload the stuff, we're delivering it up to the
[store] door," Fisk said.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the stadium, workers are whizzing through the halls in golf
carts, talking into walkie-talkies. Beepers buzz, cell phones ring.</TE>
<TE>   A casual observer might not notice the changes, but there are
many. Red, white and blue bunting circles the stands. The tops of the
dugouts have been painted, then repainted--first to say "American
League Division Series," then updated to read "American League
Championship Series." Groundskeepers are mowing fresh patterns and
carefully imprinting a big "A" into the grass.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really busy and we're pulling our hair out, but it's a
really fun kind of busy," said Jenny Price, party planner and human
resources manager. "We'd rather be doing this than standing on the
sidelines watching some other team."</TE>

<HD>Home Fire Kills 'Laugh-In' Star</HD>
<DH>Accidents: Teresa Graves, who appeared in 'Get Christie
Love!,' dies after a faulty space heater ignites a blaze in her
bedroom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Teresa Graves--who appeared regularly on "Rowan and Martin's
Laugh-In" and went on to star in her own television series, "Get
Christie Love!" died early Thursday after a fire swept through the
back of her home in the Hyde Park district, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Graves, 54, was found unconscious in a bedroom where the fire
apparently broke out. Doctors at Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood
were unable to revive her.</LD>
<LD>   Fire investigators said the blaze, which broke out about 12:30
a.m., was apparently caused by a faulty space heater in the bedroom,
which had been added by enclosing a porch on the house in the 3400
block of West 78th Place. A smoke detector in the front of the house
apparently went off, but failed to awaken the actress, officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   Graves, who was born in Houston, started her entertainment career
as a singer with the Doodletown Pipers in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Her 1969 acting debut came in the popular comedy show "Laugh-In,"
hosted by Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. The show, consisting largely of
a disjointed series of skits, launched several actors on successful
careers, including Goldie Hawn, Arte Johnson and Graves.</TE>
<TE>   Graves appeared on several Bob Hope television specials in 1970
and 1971 and had a featured role in "The Funny Side," a television
series in 1971 and 1972. Her biggest role was that of the title
character in "Get Christie Love!" which aired in 1974 and 1975.</TE>
<TE>   She appeared in several movies in the mid-1970s, including "That
Man Bolt," "Black Eye" and "Old Dracula." Her final show business
appearance was in a Bob Hope special in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood publications indicate that she abandoned her acting
career in 1983 to concentrate on her involvement with the Jehovah's
Witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said she leaves her mother, who had lived with her but
was hospitalized recently after a stroke.</TE>

<HD>Crowded Future Challenges Imaginations of Planners</HD>
<DH>Development: A USC exercise asks activists and
professionals to find room in the Southland for 6 million new
residents expected in the next 25 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The task seemed straightforward: Figure out where 6 million people
whom forecasters project will be added to Southern California in the
next quarter-century are going to live.</LD>
<LD>   But the headaches it created were enormous.</LD>
<LD>   The Great Park at El Toro became tens of thousands of housing
units. Preserves at Ballona Wetlands were wiped out, and high-rises
were placed in the heart of agriculture zones in Ventura County.</LD>
<TE>   And that was before the 200 civic leaders at the Reality Check on
Growth held at USC on Thursday even had to make their toughest
decisions, as they placed stickers representing thousands of homes or
millions of square feet of commercial space on maps of the region.</TE>
<TE>   By day's end they would be calling for tunnels through the
mountains of the Cleveland National Forest, bullet trains to carry
suburbanites home to Palmdale, and warehouses on biologically
sensitive land at Rancho Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   The "visioning" process sponsored by USC's Lusk Center for Real
Estate and the Urban Land Institute of Los Angeles flustered even the
most experienced urban planners.</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, was the point: to force local leaders to confront
the reality the region is facing. Anyone who placed their stickers
consistent with current growth patterns found it impossible to
complete the game. There simply wasn't enough room.</TE>
<TE>   "You are going to have to think outside the box," warned Raphael
Bostic, a professor of real estate at USC, as the exercise got
underway. "Things people said you couldn't do, you are going to have
to do."</TE>
<TE>   The participants worked in teams that were mixed with people from
clashing backgrounds. Developers had to work with environmentalists.
Low-income housing advocates stood alongside elected officials from
wealthy suburbs. Consensus did not come easily.</TE>
<TE>   The teams produced vastly different visions for how the region
should grow. One map had the 6 million newcomers living mostly among
densely packed transit villages--some in areas that are built out and
would have to be redeveloped. Existing rail lines were replaced with
high-speed versions. There was even a bicycle freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Across the room, the opposite approach was taken. A group proposed
creating an entirely new master-planned community for hundreds of
thousands of residents in the Antelope Valley. Their plan included
building new infrastructure from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   One concept that was not too popular with participants was
low-density housing, defined by yellow stickers.</TE>
<TE>   The groups started off with 582 of the stickers. They quickly
found that it was nearly impossible to fit them all on the map. Most
groups traded the bulk of their low-density stickers for much smaller
ones that symbolized clustered and high-rise development.</TE>
<TE>   Event organizers, many of whom have been supporters of building
high-density clusters, say their intention is to engage civic leaders
in a new type of planning that forces entire communities to work
together in tackling the tough questions raised by growth issues.</TE>
<TE>   That was particularly appealing to Los Angeles City Councilman Ed
Reyes, who said his district already is overcrowded with 147 people
per acre and doesn't have enough housing to go around.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to make sure that we consider what kind of quality of
life these decisions would create for people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet during the exercise, Reyes resisted the temptation to steer
all the new population toward low-density suburbs. Doing so, he said,
would wreak havoc on environmental resources all of Southern
California relies on.</TE>
<TE>   The visioning process was first tried in Salt Lake City a few
years ago, where it was wildly successful.</TE>
<TE>   The process triggered a regional dialogue that ultimately changed
many people's perceptions about alternatives to single-family
residential sprawl. The city ultimately adopted a growth plan that
linked many planned villages to alternative transportation.</TE>
<TE>   The Utah process stretched out for several months. Planners are
hoping the same thing will happen on both a local and regional level
in the Los Angeles metropolitan area under the guidance of the
Southern California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's exercise offered a sampling of what that would involve.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a remarkable process," said Stuart Gabriel, director of the
Lusk Center for Real Estate. "How often do you get environmentalists
and developers who usually moan about one another standing side by
side and working on solutions?"</TE>

<HD>Charles Guggenheim, 78; His Documentaries Won 4 Academy
Awards</HD>

<LD>Charles Guggenheim, one of the country's most honored and prolific
documentary filmmakers, whose work earned four Academy Awards, has
died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Guggenheim, a pioneer director of political campaign TV
commercials and films who was media director for the presidential
campaigns of Adlai Stevenson, Robert F. Kennedy, George McGovern and
Edward M. Kennedy, died of pancreatic cancer Wednesday in Georgetown
University Hospital in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday Review movie critic Hollis Alpert once described
Guggenheim as "probably the most accomplished maker of documentary
films in the country."</LD>
<TE>   He began his five-decade career in film in 1952, when he produced
TV political spots for Stevenson. He went on to direct and produce
more than 100 documentaries on a broad range of subjects: from
construction of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis and the refurbishing of
the Statue of Liberty to remembering D-day and chronicling hate
crimes in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Guggenheim, who received awards in major international film
competitions and a George Foster Peabody Award in 1951 for a live
production on the Bronx Zoo, received 12 Academy Award nominations.</TE>
<TE>   He won his four Oscars for "Nine From Little Rock" (1964), about
the 1957 school integration crisis; "Robert Kennedy Remembered"
(1968), a film biography completed in six weeks after Kennedy's
assassination in June 1968 and shown at the Democratic National
Convention; "The Johnstown Flood" (1989), which commemorated the 19th
century disaster in Pennsylvania that killed 2,300; and "A Time for
Justice" (1994), the story of the civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   Eight of Guggenheim's documentaries are on permanent exhibit at
various institutions, including the Ellis Island Museum in New York,
the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena and the National D-Day Museum in
New Orleans, as well as the presidential libraries of Harry S.
Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "He helped tell the story of America with his genius," Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with the 1956 presidential campaign of Stevenson,
Guggenheim directed media campaigns into the 1980s for more than 75
congressional, gubernatorial and presidential candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the first in it, and I think he set the style for
it too," Jack Valenti, president  of the Motion Picture Assn. of
America and a close friend of Guggenheim, told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "He recognized early on, before almost any political filmmakers,
that people vote viscerally, not intellectually," Valenti said. "So
he tried to appeal to the emotions--the heart rather than the head.
And that's what made his campaign stuff not only unique but
powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Guggenheim took the same approach with his documentaries, Valenti
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He took events which had an emotional impact, and then he brought
them to full display on the screen, and that's what I think was his
great power."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Guggenheim received the International Documentary
Assn.'s Career Achievement Award.</TE>
<TE>   Guggenheim was born and raised in Cincinnati, where his father and
grandfather were well-to-do furniture merchants.</TE>
<TE>   But Guggenheim's privileged childhood was unhappily marked by a
then-little known learning disorder: He had dyslexia, and didn't
learn to read until the fourth grade. Considered slow, he endured the
taunts of classmates.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I was smart," he told the Washington Post in 1996.
But without his childhood anguish and the sensitivities it gave rise
to, he said, he may have wound up "selling furniture in Cincinnati"
instead of becoming a filmmaker.</TE>
<TE>   After studying agriculture for a year at Colorado A&amp;M, he was
drafted into the Army in 1943. After World War II, he studied
contemporary European history and rhetorical criticism at the
University of Iowa, then moved to New York intent on getting into
broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   His first job, at CBS radio, was running errands for humorist Herb
Shriner. But by 1952, he was producing "Fearless Fosdick," an NBC
children's TV series featuring marionettes, on which, Guggenheim once
said, he "began to learn the business from the top down."</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, after working at public broadcasting stations in Ames,
Iowa, and St. Louis, Guggenheim launched Guggenheim Productions,
which he moved from St. Louis to Washington, D.C., in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Guggenheim produced and directed his first feature movie in 1959:
"The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery," a modest crime caper starring
Steve McQueen.</TE>
<TE>   "I've made a few feature films and more than a few political
commercials," Guggenheim said at the time of his Career Achievement
Award, "but mainly I've stuck with documentaries, because that's what
feels right to me."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, Guggenheim began making documentaries for the
U.S. Information Agency under motion picture service director George
Stevens Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say as a documentary filmmaker, Charlie had more strings in
his bow than anyone of our time," Stevens told The Times on
Wednesday, listing several of Guggenheim's memorable and diverse
films.</TE>
<TE>   "The other thing is he had, in everything he did, a level of taste
and integrity that was at the very top," said Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   Guggenheim battled with cancer the last seven months, but until a
month ago he continued working to finish the movie he had begun more
than two years ago</TE>
<TE>   "Berga: Soldiers of Another War," a co-production with WNET-TV in
New York, is the first film told and narrated in Guggenheim's own
words.</TE>
<TE>   It is the untold story of 350 American soldiers who were captured
during the Battle of the Bulge and, because they were Jewish or
looked Jewish, were sent to a brutal slave labor camp in Berga,
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Some of them were from Guggenheim's infantry division, but
Guggenheim, who was Jewish, had been hospitalized with a foot
infection when his fellow soldiers left for Europe and the Battle of
the Bulge in 1944. In what he called "an act of fate," he didn't go
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was haunted by that act of fate a long time, and it
was one of the things that propelled him to make that movie," said
Guggenheim's son, Davis, a director whose television credits include
"NYPD Blue" and "ER" and who is married to actress Elisabeth Shue.
"Berga: Soldiers of Another War" will air nationally next spring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a brave and wonderful film," said Valenti, who has seen it.
"It's a miracle he was able to get through it, but I just think he
willed himself not to take to a bed until that movie was finished,
and that's exactly what he did."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Guggenheim is survived by his wife,
Marion; his daughter, Grace of Washington, D.C., who worked with her
father as a producer; another son, Jonathan of Los Angeles, a
screenwriter; and four grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service in Washington is pending.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Hospital Official, Wife Charged in Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former executive at the City of Hope and his wife have been
arrested on charges that they stole more than $1 million from the
hospital through a fraudulent auction of hospital properties.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Rohn, 40, and Julia Eleanor Castlen, 39, were arrested
Tuesday in Los Angeles and San Diego respectively on charges of
conspiracy, grand theft and money laundering.</LD>
<LD>   Rohn is also charged with two counts of fraudulently altering or
falsifying corporate papers by a corporate agent. They were being
held on $1.3-million bail each and were expected to be arraigned
early next week.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, lawyers for Rohn, the former real estate department
director of the hospital, a nonprofit cancer research and treatment
center in Duarte, said the charges against him stemmed from a
"misunderstanding" by new hospital management over the extent of
Rohn's authority to manage the hospital's real estate interests.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office alleges that Rohn sold some of the
properties that had been donated to the hospital in an all-or-nothing
bulk sale in 1996. Oil assets were also sold.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on Rohn's advice, the hospital accepted a bid of $288,120
for the properties from a company called K&amp;K Oil.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint against Rohn and Castlen alleges that Rohn
influenced the hospital to accept K&amp;K's bid because he and his wife
had an interest in K&amp;K through another company they controlled, and
that Rohn added "valuable City of Hope real estate to the assets sold
in the bulk sale."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials said that the properties sold to K&amp;K had a
market value substantially higher than K&amp;K's bid and estimated that
they had lost in excess of $1 million on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Victor M. Minjares said that the arrests had
been made after an independent property evaluation firm confirmed
that the numbers provided by City of Hope were accurate.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope filed a civil suit against Rohn in June. That suit is
still pending, said City of Hope's general counsel, Glenn Krinsky. In
the meantime, he said, the hospital has been cooperating with the
district attorney's investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Rohn's attorneys, John Vandevelde and
Janet Levine, charged that the City of Hope had "instigated, directed
and in part, financed a four-year investigation by the district
attorney."</TE>
<TE>   "Even though Mr. Rohn has cooperated fully in the criminal
investigation," the statement said, " ... the district attorney chose
to use two raid teams to effect totally unnecessary early morning
arrests of Mr. Rohn and his wife, taking them away from their two
infant children and holding them in custody on an artificially
inflated bail."</TE>

<HD>Owner of Ranch for Unwanted Horses Disputes Allegations
That They Have Been Mistreated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine a wave of inspectors showing up at a hospital--and accusing
the owners of wrongdoing because there are sick patients inside.
According to James Hardie, that's roughly what's happened at his
Inland Empire ranch that specializes in rescuing abandoned, unwanted,
old and sick horses.</LD>
<LD>   State and county officials have a different view. Neither the
Riverside County Department of Animal Services nor the state
Department of Agriculture would comment Thursday on the case. But in
recent days, county officials have alleged that horses found by
inspectors on the 13.6-acre ranch owned by Hardie and his wife were
in terrible condition. Some horses' ribs were poking out, they have
said, and others could not walk.</LD>
<LD>   So far, no charges have been filed, but Hardie said he and his
wife, Deborah Loren Hardie, anticipate that inspectors will pursue a
neglect case against them.</LD>
<TE>   The Hardies say they have been rescuing sick, elderly and unwanted
horses since 1995, starting informally.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the Hardies decided to form an official nonprofit agency.</TE>
<TE>   Legally, the ranch was allowed to house 67 horses. But "we
couldn't say no," Hardie said. "We couldn't say no to a horse."</TE>
<TE>   So the stock kept building up--and at one point the Hardies and
their small team of volunteers had 103 horses on the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   They quickly ran out of money. Hardie acknowledges he was in over
his head but insists the horses were "not mistreated."</TE>

<HD>Project May Offer Entree to Real Jobs</HD>
<DH>Jail: Female inmates learn construction and beautify a
once-ugly corner at Twin Towers, gaining potentially valuable work
skills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're not doing hard time at the jail in downtown Los Angeles.
They're doing hardscape.</LD>
<LD>   Female inmates are pouring concrete, constructing block walls and
planting trees to create a graceful new entryway to welcome people to
the Twin Towers lockup.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm proud of it--it's going to look very nice," Tonya Dennis said
this week as she wrestled a heavy hose to spread a thick layer of
concrete for a sidewalk next to the corner of Vignes and Bauchet
streets. "When I get out, I'm going to bring my kids here and show
them I contributed to this."</LD>
<TE>   Dennis, a 41-year-old Gardena resident serving a four-month
sentence for forgery, is one of about 150 women who over the last
year have helped plan and create a park-like setting near the main
entrance to the jail.</TE>
<TE>   Working in groups of 14 at a time, the inmates receive classroom
instruction on the finer points of irrigation-sprinkler installation,
concrete-block laying or landscaping before being escorted outside to
do the work.</TE>
<TE>   Only low-risk inmates are invited to join the work crew, which is
supervised by vocational teachers from the Hacienda-La Puente Unified
School District.</TE>
<TE>   The do-it-yourself beautification project completes a missing
piece of the $373-million, state-of-the-art jail. When the 4,100-bed
Twin Towers Correctional Facility opened 5 1/2 years ago, its
entrance was marked only by a minimalist, 6-foot-tall sign erected on
the vacant corner lot.</TE>
<TE>   But the lot soon became a dusty patch overgrown with weeds after
its sprinkler system was crushed by TV news vans that parked there
while covering occasional stories at the jail.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept sending people out there to clean up trash. So we
thought, 'Why not do something with that corner? Why not convert the
cleanup crew into a landscape crew? " said Sheriff's Capt. John A.
Franklin, who helps run Twin Towers.</TE>
<TE>   Plans were drawn up, and jail administrators began searching for
money to pay for tools and materials. They decided to finance the
$75,000 project with cash from an inmate services program that is
funded by proceeds from vending machines and pay telephones inside
the jail.</TE>
<TE>   "The county didn't have the money. And we couldn't find outside
donations. It's real hard to get people to sponsor a jail," said
Sheriff's Lt. Jack Carey, another Twin Towers administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Vocational instructor Bob Reyes said he worked vocabulary and
mathematics lessons into his construction class curriculum, which
included hands-on instruction in the use of tools ranging from
shovels to laser levels.</TE>
<TE>   "At first there is insecurity on their part. Some of the women
have never had their hands dirty--they've never had a job," Reyes
said. "We discuss the work first and then go out and actually do it.
When they're doing the work, you can see things click in their eyes
as they realize, 'I did it!' "</TE>
<TE>   The inmates will take a sledgehammer to the existing jail sign in
about two weeks, when they are ready to stucco a new, wall-like
masonry sign that curves around the street corner.</TE>
<TE>   "The women were joking that we should sell tickets to destroy the
old sign, and we could raise more money for the project," said Reyes,
who estimates that it would have cost the county as much as $400,000
to pay professionals for the corner makeover.</TE>
<TE>   The project's supervisors say some of the women have honed skills
they can use in paying jobs. Those completing the class receive
certificates that specify their skill level, according to Addelle
Hutak, a coordinator with the Hacienda-La Puente district.</TE>
<TE>   "At least 20 have gotten jobs doing masonry or landscaping. That's
huge, well above our expectations," Reyes said. Pointing to inmate
Mary Flint-Herrera, he added: "She could get an apprentice job
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Well, not tomorrow. But maybe in January, when she finishes her
one-year sentence for an accessory-to-burglary conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "I like cement work, bricks, the hardscape," said the 28-year-old
Lancaster resident, using the term professionals use to describe
garden structures. "I like not feeling like there's a need to commit
a crime to make money. I plan to become a mason. I definitely plan to
be doing this and getting paid for it when I get out."</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Heredia, a Venice resident serving a year for a narcotics
conviction parole violation, said the work she and the others have
done will make the jail more pleasant for families visiting inmates.
She remembers Twin Towers' entrance before.</TE>
<TE>   "I was here two years ago, and this was awful-looking. It made the
jail look ugly," she said. "But now it's going to look wonderful. And
it's something I accomplished--something I helped create."</TE>

<LD>California regulators have rejected a request by Kaiser Permanente,
the state's largest HMO, to set limits as low as $500 on coverage for
prescription drugs in some insurance policies.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Zingale, director of the California Department of Managed
Health Care, said he was deeply troubled by Kaiser's proposal because
it could have denied patients access to lifesaving drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Zingale said his agency is conscious of the growing cost of
prescription drugs but he added that cost-cutting efforts must be
designed so they don't endanger people.</LD>
<TE>   "A person living with HIV faces drug bills of $15,000 per year to
stay alive," Zingale wrote in a letter Wednesday to Kaiser Chairman
and Chief Executive George Halvorson.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kaiser proposal could force many people with HIV, under the
impression that their health-care investment covers lifesaving drugs,
to choose between food and medication," Zingale wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "No one with heart disease, cancer, diabetes or HIV should be
denied lifesaving drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser spokesman Matthew Schiffgens said the health maintenance
organization had withdrawn its request on Tuesday, a day before
Zingale sent his letter rejecting it. Even so, Schiffgens said, the
insurer views drug caps as reasonable, given the current realities of
medical economics.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that these are useful and responsive tools for balancing
the rapidly escalating cost of pharmaceuticals and the imperative to
keep insurance premiums affordable for California's health-care
consumers," Schiffgens said. "It's clearly been demonstrated that
when health insurance premiums increase, consumers begin to decide
that they can't afford coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Under Kaiser's proposal, the caps would have applied to some
members of Kaiser's individual and small-group policies.</TE>
<TE>   California law allows insurers to sell individual policies that
include no drug benefit at all. But once a plan includes any
prescription coverage, certain minimum standards apply, such as
mandatory coverage of diabetes drugs, contraceptives and pain
management medications.</TE>
<TE>   Zingale's action is just the latest in his agency's battle with
California HMOs over coverage for prescription drugs. In January, a
judge in Sacramento ruled that the agency could not force Blue Shield
of California to provide a weight-loss drug to an obese member. In
July 2001, another judge said the state could not require Kaiser
Permanente to cover Viagra or other drugs to remedy sexual
dysfunction.</TE>
<TE>   Those court losses prompted the Legislature to approve a bill this
year that gives Zingale's agency explicit authority to regulate
prescription drug benefits offered by HMOs. Gov. Gray Davis signed
the bill, despite opposition from Kaiser and the insurance industry.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all insurers place dollar limits on drug spending for
senior citizens in Medicare HMOs, which aren't regulated by Zingale's
office. But experience has shown that patients with chronic
conditions quickly use up their benefits and then face thousands of
dollars in out-of-pocket expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Zingale said his agency will soon begin a study to determine when
caps are appropriate and how low they should be set. Zingale's
predecessors allowed drug caps as low as $1,000 for some Kaiser
policies, but he plans to re-evaluate them with his new legislative
authority.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser, which insures 6.3 million Californians, said it will
continue trying to make drug coverage affordable and accessible.
"Affordability is a very important issue," Schiffgens said.</TE>

<HD>Convention Board Rejects Resignation of Embattled Chief</HD>
<DH>Finances: Official is under fire for fewer bookings and for
spending, but the board says he is needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing criticism for lavish spending and lagging event bookings,
George Kirkland offered to resign the presidency of the Los Angeles
Convention and Visitors Bureau on Thursday, but board members refused
to accept his offer, saying that they need him to stay and help
reform the agency.</LD>
<LD>   Kirkland, who became bureau president in 1989, made the offer to
step aside during a meeting of the bureau's executive board, said
board Chairman Alan Rothenberg.</LD>
<LD>   "In the course of the meeting, George said that if it would solve
the problems, he cares about the bureau and the city and he would
step aside," Rothenberg said. "It wasn't just a gesture. It was
sincere. But we don't see where that would solve any problems, and it
might make the problems worse."</LD>
<TE>   About 42 major conventions have canceled plans to come to Los
Angeles in the last three years. Only 16 major events are booked for
next year, down from 28 this year and 35 the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Rothenberg said Kirkland has the skills to turn the performance of
the bureau around, but that other measures need to be taken. Los
Angeles, he said, continues to lose conventions because there are so
few modern hotel rooms within close walking distance of the city's
convention center.</TE>
<TE>   "George is recognized around the country as the dean, a leader in
this industry," Rothenberg said. "We totally support George."</TE>
<TE>   The drop in convention business is expected to result in a decline
in visitor spending of $35 million next year. The prospects of such a
decline recently prompted the managers of nine downtown hotels to
demand a change in leadership and direction of the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Zen, owner of the Bonaventure Hotel and chairman of the city
Convention Center Board, said he was disappointed that the board had
not accepted Kirkland's offer to step aside.</TE>
<TE>   "If the board thinks he is doing a good job, then they have to
re-examine their criteria for doing a good job," Zen said.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland did not return calls seeking comment. One source familiar
with the issue said some board members felt it was not the right time
for Kirkland to quit, given that the city government will soon be
considering whether to renew its contract with the convention bureau.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the concerns about the bureau's booking performance have
been exacerbated by its spending habits. In recent years, the bureau
has spent $3 million annually on food, travel and entertainment in
the name of promoting the city to potential convention customers and
tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland's $285,000 salary was supplemented by $199,000 in bonuses
in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. He led a number of trips
abroad, including one in which the bureau rented a hall at Kensington
Palace to entertain airline executives and spent $84,000 taking tour
operators to the Wimbledon tennis championships.</TE>
<TE>   One year, the bureau spent $835,000 on a gala dinner in which
3,000 tour operators were entertained in Glasgow, Scotland, by pop
singer Natalie Cole and her orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   The spending might not have caused so much stir if the bureau had
been more successful in bringing conventions and tourists to Los
Angeles, some critics said.</TE>
<TE>   Rothenberg acknowledged that Kirkland has had some problems.</TE>
<TE>   "George is not perfect. He has made mistakes," the chairman said.</TE>
<TE>   But he also cited other factors in the poor booking rate.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks in New York and Virginia last year, for
instance, suppressed tourism across the country, including Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   And for Los Angeles, the city's reputation remains a stumbling
block, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a problem in this city, and that is our image outside the
city stinks," Rothenberg said.</TE>

<HD>KOCE Foundation Hopes to Keep TV Station Under Local
Control</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's public television station would remain locally owned
and controlled under a proposal by the station's fund-raising
foundation.</LD>
<LD>   The KOCE-TV Foundation has made a bid to acquire the license and
take over operations of the station from the Coast Community College
District and to fund KOCE's conversion to digital broadcasting,
foundation officials said Thursday. A price wasn't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The foundation has raised $4 million to pay for equipment so that
KOCE meets a Federal Communications Commission deadline for all
public television stations to switch from analog to digital
broadcasting by 2003.</LD>
<TE>   The cost of moving to digital technology prompted the college
district in May to solicit bids for a partner or buyer for the
station.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman University submitted a bid, but withdrew it recently. With
an Oct. 1 deadline for bids, that left the KOCE-TV Foundation as the
sole suitor, foundation board Chairman Bob Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The community college district board needs to approve the deal,
and a vote might not come for three or four months, district
spokeswoman Erin Cohn said.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $4.5 million is needed to upgrade facilities and
cameras at KOCE's studios at Golden West College in Huntington Beach.</TE>

<HD>Tomato Thief Finds Herself in a Pickle When Outraged Grower
Gives Chase</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is it with all these reports of produce pilfering? The other
day, I mentioned that Laguna Beach police were notified about a
pumpkin being snatched from a nursery during a daring daylight theft.
Now, the Beach Reporter's crime report says a passerby in Manhattan
Beach reached over a wall and stole a tomato from a resident's
garden.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Laguna merchant noticed his loss too late, the
Manhattan Beach grower witnessed the foul deed and gave chase. The
thief ran, but she was "pushing a blue, single-seat baby jogger," the
Reporter said. "The man saw a bundle of something in the seat but was
not sure if it was a child."</LD>
<LD>   Obviously she hadn't planned her escape very well. Anyway, the
victim caught the woman, but not red-handed. She claimed she had
thrown the tomato on the grass during the chase. The victim couldn't
find it.</LD>
<TE>   Wait, there's more! Unwilling to give up, the tomato owner--who
said he had been beset by produce thieves in the past--chased after
the woman again. This time, he had her take him to the spot. Together
they located the fruit. (Or is it a vegetable? But I can't get into
that now.) The good news: "No damage was done to the tomato," the
Beach Reporter said. No charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   Literary allegations: The image of the tomato thief chasing the
baby-jogger reminded me of a Sue Grafton mystery in which a hit man
pushes around a child in a stroller during his murderous forays
throughout the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   This was a plot device I thought of first, but Grafton somehow
reached into my mind and stole the idea before I could write what
surely would have been a bestseller.</TE>
<TE>   More food for thought: All this talk about tomatoes made me think
of a shot by Gary Labb of a restaurant advertising what I always
thought was an east-of-the-border dish (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   What's the name of our other baseball team? With all the
excitement surrounding the slugging Anaheim Angels, I had forgotten
that the L.A. area had another team until I received a photo of a
doll from Dick and Vanessa Deskin of Irvine. They brought the Dodger
curio--that's right, the team is called the Dodgers--from St.
Petersburg, Russia, of all places.</TE>
<TE>   Notice the pencil-thin bat the Dodger player is holding, symbolic,
I guess, of the team's weak hitting.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic umpire: "In Monrovia," quipped Michael Johnson, "we use
international hand signals along with our street signs" (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: Driving home Thursday, I saw a crow pecking away at a
discarded, half-filled coffee-flavored drink on a sidewalk. The idea
of a crow having a caffeine high struck me as truly scary.</TE>

<HD>Court Approval Needed to Use 'Supermax' Cells</HD>
<DH>Prison: Judge rules officials must also notify inmates'
lawyers and a facility watchdog before moving mentally ill convicts
to the new high-security units.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A federal judge signed an order Thursday barring California prison
officials from housing mentally ill inmates in controversial new
"Supermax" isolation cells without prior approval from the court.</LD>
<LD>   The order comes after lawyers for mentally ill convicts claimed
the cells' stark design creates extreme sensory deprivation that is
inhumane and would make the inmates sicker.</LD>
<LD>   Signed by U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton, the order
represents an agreement between the attorneys and the Department of
Corrections and spells out strict conditions under which the inmates
may be placed in the cells.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very happy," said Michael Bien, one of several attorneys
representing convicts in the case. "If any mentally ill prisoners are
placed in these Supermax units, it will be closely monitored by the
court, not as part of some inappropriate experiment."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections, Margot Bach, said
the state already had agreed to most of the conditions listed in the
court order.</TE>
<TE>   She added that all plans to place mentally ill prisoners in the
special cells remain on hold pending further discussions with the
attorneys, but said the department stands behind the cells' design.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the best for our inmates, and we think these units are an
improvement over the current environment they're in," Bach said.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute over the new high-security cells is part of ongoing
litigation over how California's sprawling prison system treats its
mentally ill inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Bach said roughly 20% of the 158,000 convicts in the state's 33
prisons have been diagnosed as mentally disturbed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, a federal judge found that the system provided inadequate
mental health care and ordered a series of remedies. Since then, the
prisons have been under the scrutiny of a court-appointed special
master who monitors progress.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the Department of Corrections planned to begin housing
up to 52 mentally ill inmates in a new isolation unit at the
Substance Abuse Treatment Facility in Corcoran. It is one of 10 such
facilities--known as "administrative segregation" units--opening
throughout the prison system.</TE>
<TE>   Built at a cost of $86 million, the new units were built to
temporarily isolate inmates who are either troublemakers or a danger
to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Mentally ill prisoners are frequently housed in such facilities
because they assault or are preyed upon by other inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, department officials informed Special Master J. Michael
Keating Jr. of their plan to begin placing some mentally ill inmates
in the new Corcoran unit.</TE>
<TE>   Documents show the department planned to have a six-month
"evaluation project" involving about 50 inmates in the new cells, and
a "control group" of 50 more in traditional segregation cells.</TE>
<TE>   The evaluation project is necessary, the documents say, to
determine whether the new cells "result in extreme sensory
deprivation that may be detrimental to the mental health of the
inmates."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the inmates characterized that project as an illegal
experiment that put the health of their clients at risk. In a letter
to the department, Keating agreed, raising concerns about placing
mentally disordered prisoners in an environment of "physical
austerity" and "reduced sensory input."</TE>
<TE>   "The opening in the cell door faces a blank white wall ... there
is no direct natural light, and day is barely discernible from
night," Keating wrote. "Opportunities to observe the activities of
other people are minimal."</TE>
<TE>   Because the mentally ill are less able to cope with social
isolation, confinement in a small space and reduced stimuli, they
would face extra risks in the newly designed cells, Keating said.</TE>
<TE>   Bien, who toured the cells in August, said they resemble housing
units at Pelican Bay State Prison that were previously declared
unsuitable for mentally ill inmates by two federal judges. The
judges, ruling in the lawsuit over mentally ill inmates and a
separate case, found that housing psychologically disturbed convicts
under such conditions violates the 8th Amendment's bar on cruel and
unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Bach, however, denied that the new cells are inhumane and rejected
the assertion that the department planned an experiment to determine
their effect on mentally ill prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   She acknowledged that the cells have no windows to the
outdoors--because of cost constraints--but said they provide a
"quieter environment with more privacy" than the prison's traditional
isolation units.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, they're in a fishbowl, and their meetings with
psychologists take place right out in the middle of the dayroom,"
Bach said. "During their exercise--a minimum of 10 hours a week--they
can see the sky and talk to each other over the fence."</TE>
<TE>   Under the court order, prison officials must provide 60 days'
notice when they intend to shift a mentally ill inmate into a new
cell.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, they must provide to Keating and inmate attorneys
proof of sufficient clinical staffing in the isolation unit; of
enhanced monitoring; of screening to determine whether placement in
the cells is clinically appropriate; and a process for tracking
inmates to measure any negative effects.</TE>

<HD>Jury to Decide Case of Vietnamese Protester</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury will now decide whether a Vietnamese woman who tried to set
herself on fire last year is guilty of charges as serious as
terrorism, or whether she simply wanted to protest Communism in her
native country.</LD>
<LD>   Closing arguments wrapped up in federal court Thursday in the case
of Ngoc Hanh Dang Nguyen, who was arrested last December. Witnesses
say she carried a black bag to the front of a ballroom in the
Marriott Hotel, where Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan
Dzung was speaking.</LD>
<LD>   She was tackled while allegedly trying to light torches that were
in the bag along with a jug of gasoline.</LD>
<TE>   "My client is consistently saying the same thing," defense
attorney Gregor D. Guy-Smith said in his closing argument. "She came
here to protest. She came here to light herself on fire."</TE>
<TE>   Self-immolation is a traditional Vietnamese form of protest that
gained international attention in 1963, when a famous photograph was
taken of a Buddhist monk setting himself on fire in what was then
Saigon. But prosecutors argued that Nguyen, who lived in France after
escaping from Vietnam in 1989, intended to harm the Vietnamese
official, not commit suicide.</TE>

<HD>Earth First! Activist Dies After Fall From Tree</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man with the environmental activist group Earth First! has died
after a fall of more than 50 feet from a redwood tree in the Ramsey
Gulch area about 20 miles south of San Jose, raising concerns about
the dangers of tree-sits, often used to stop logging operations.</LD>
<LD>   The man, whose identity hasn't been released but went by the
forest name Naya, had only been in the tree about 12 hours on Tuesday
evening when he fell, according to Dennis Davie of the Santa Cruz
contingent of Earth First!</LD>
<LD>   "Santa Cruz Earth First! is deeply saddened by this tragic event.
We never like to lose an activist," said Davie. "This was a young man
in his first tree-sit."</LD>
<TE>   Naya had just come to the area to join the protest Monday night
and had climbed into the tree Tuesday morning, Davie said. On Tuesday
night, for an unknown reason, he fell out of the tree and was taken
by helicopter to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, where he was
pronounced dead.</TE>
<TE>   The county coroner's office had not determined the cause of death
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The man isn't the first to be injured in a tree-sit protest. In
April, 22-year-old Beth O'Brien of Portland died after falling from a
tree in Mount Hood National Forest in Oregon. In September 1998,
David "Gypsy" Chain became the first California Earth First! activist
to be killed during a tree-sit protest when the Humboldt County tree
he was living in was felled by a logger.</TE>

<CX>   Activist's death -- A news brief in Friday's California section
erroneously reported that a tree sitter died in 1998 in Humboldt
County when a logger felled the tree he was living in. In fact, he
died during a logging protest when he was struck by a tree felled by
loggers.</CX>

<LD>A former Cal State Fresno associate athletic director has filed a
discrimination claim against the university, accusing officials of
firing her for trying to comply with a law that promotes gender
equality in athletics.</LD>
<LD>   "My position was eliminated, and I was terminated from the
athletics department for and because of my support and advocacy for
complying with the law--gender equity and fairness," Diane
Milutinovich said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Milutinovich, who has worked at Fresno State for 22 years, filed
claims stating that her termination was in retaliation for playing an
integral role in assisting a two-year federal investigation that
found in 1994 that Fresno State had not complied with Title IX, a law
mandating equality in boys' and girls' sports at institutions
receiving federal funding.</LD>

<LD>Remember the pedestrian flags this city put in bins at four busy
intersections, in hopes that walkers would wave them as a safety
precaution? All 3,000 have walked off, so the city is ordering
replacements.</LD>
<LD>   The new ones will cost $1.25 each--that's $3,750 to replace the
stolen ones.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Hillier, Berkeley's assistant city manager of
transportation, said there are no plans to cancel the program--but it
will be studied before any expansion.</LD>
<TE>   "We're doing before-and-after studies of the effectiveness of the
flag program," Hillier said. "We really need to know the impact of
the flags."</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley implemented the plan in December.</TE>

<LD>If a picture is worth a thousand words, Assemblywoman Fran Pavley was
fortunate to have photographs to get her point across to fellow
legislators.</LD>
<LD>   The Agoura Hills Democrat was getting one puzzled look after
another last year when she sought votes for a routine bill to allow
eight miles of roadway in her district to be designated as a scenic
highway.</LD>
<LD>   "They thought everything around Los Angeles has been paved over
and there's nothing left to save," she recalled. "Then we showed them
photos and they said, 'Ohhh, that's near L.A.?' " She got the votes.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday, Pavley and other officials dedicated eight miles of Las
Virgenes and Malibu Canyon roads, spanning the Santa Monica Mountains
from Calabasas to the ocean, as a state-protected scenic highway.</TE>
<TE>   The new label for the Malibu Canyon roadway pleased Robin Gensley
Mitchell, whose family has owned land nearby for 60 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This was once a Chumash metropolitan area, and the De Anza
expedition of Spanish colonists came through here," said Mitchell, a
docent for adjacent Malibu Creek State Park. "This is a beautiful
area, but there's also a lot of history to it, and it needs to be
preserved."</TE>
<TE>   Today, more than 5 million people travel the route every year,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Malibu Canyon roadway is now a "county scenic highway," one of
five such roads in California and the only one in Southern
California. Caltrans hasn't granted the designation anywhere in the
state since 1981, when it installed the scenic highway "poppy signs"
on Lake Boulevard in Shasta County.</TE>
<TE>   Under a program begun in 1963, the agency dedicated 1,264 miles of
state scenic highways and about 50 miles of county scenic highways.
Both categories are protected from billboards, excessive grading of
nearby property and high-density development.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials said a designation is granted only when local
officials pass laws or resolutions to preserve a scenic corridor. The
requirements and review process are so stringent that few counties
apply for the designation, said Doug Failing, Caltrans district
director for Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley and others said efforts to get scenic status for Malibu
Canyon began in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Against a backdrop of rugged mountains and oak-speckled
grasslands, county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said: "We want to
preserve what we have for future generations."</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas attorney Daniel Bergman, who attended the dedication,
said he remembers being driven through the canyon to the Cottontail
Ranch summer camp in 1958 at the age of 6. Certain features, such as
unusual rock formations, stuck in his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Today I still see those same landmarks," he said. "They haven't
changed a bit."</TE>

<HD>Woodland Hills Panel Backs Valley Secession</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Endorsement is a setback for Hahn, who has
promoted neighborhood councils as viable alternatives to breaking up
Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Woodland Hills Neighborhood Council on Thursday announced that it
has endorsed San Fernando Valley secession, dealing a blow to Mayor
James K. Hahn's efforts to promote the councils as alternatives to a
municipal breakup.</LD>
<LD>   In better news for the mayor, the Los Angeles-area branch of the
Sierra Club said Friday that it opposes secession because of concerns
that a breakup might threaten environmental protections enforced by
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The Woodland Hills panel is the first neighborhood council to back
the secession measure on the Nov. 5 ballot. Hahn has touted the
burgeoning system of elected advisory councils as a means of getting
residents more involved in government without breaking the city
apart. Voters approved the system three years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Members of the Woodland Hills council, which represents about
70,000 residents, said they are frustrated with their advisory role,
because they have no power to make decisions on local budget and
planning issues.</TE>
<TE>   "City Hall set up neighborhood councils to give the individual
communities in Los Angeles a voice, and yet we are still being
ignored," said Johnny Walker, a council member.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Enfield, council chairwoman, said the vote to endorse Valley
secession on Wednesday night was 11 to 5, with one abstention.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people out here are very frustrated by the level of
services and the high cost we pay for what we get," she said. "The
vote reflects that frustration."</TE>
<TE>   Enfield also said she was "appalled" to get calls from city
officials after the vote accusing the panel members of "biting the
hand that feeds us." One city official, whom she would not name,
wondered whether the vote would affect city funding for her council,
Enfield said.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I was naive to think we could be independent," she said.
"I didn't know the only opinion we could have was the city's."</TE>
<TE>   Some council members opposed to the endorsement felt the panel
should stay neutral.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't going to take a position, but the people in the
audience were up in arms, and there were 100 of them," said council
member Michael Miller, who voted against the endorsement. "They
wanted us to take a stand."</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, a spokesman for Hahn, said he does not feel that the
action represented a vote of no confidence. The mayor has proposed
giving councils more power and input in the budget process.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that a group here or there supports the breakup is going
to happen," Kuwata said. "We are still going to move ahead in a
positive way with reforms."</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders say the vote shows that neighborhood council
members believe life would be better in a smaller city.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very significant endorsement," said Laurette Healey,
co-chair of the Valley Independence Committee. "The vision of leaders
of the Valley independence movement and candidates for the new city
council is to improve and strengthen neighborhood councils by
empowering them with decision-making and budgetary authority on local
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in coming out against secession, the Sierra Club
chapter cited the "risk" that a Valley city would not adopt the same
environmental laws as are on the books in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "This places every environmental law, ordinance, regulation,
requirement and agreement at risk and may mean we will have to fight
for them all over again in the Valley," said Emil Lawton, a Sierra
Club member and Valley resident.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders dismissed the Sierra Club action as a misguided
attempt to get back into Hahn's good graces, after the group backed
Antonio Villaraigosa for mayor last year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a joke, considering that the operators of the Sunshine
Canyon Landfill are one of the biggest donors to the mayor's
anti-secession campaign," said Carlos Ferreyra, co-chair of the
Valley Independence Committee. He noted that several Valley city
council candidates want to phase out the Granada Hills-area landfill
run by Browning-Ferris Industries.</TE>
<TE>   In other news, a group of candidates for the Valley city council
released a transition plan aimed at easing the change in government.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, by 9th District candidate Wilma Bennett, the
new city would set up 30 to 50 task forces, each examining a
different part of government, from how to choose a city manager to
how to manage trash collection and city dumps.</TE>
<TE>   Under Bennett's proposal, the new city would use computer software
to track the progress of the groups. Each task force would include a
city council member, a retired expert in the field under discussion,
a young adult or teenager, a city official and five other members of
the community.</TE>
<TE>   "What an opportunity we have to position ourselves for the 21st
century," Bennett said. "We aren't stuck with old technologies, old
software, old ideas."</TE>

<PH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>'My Campaign Is Not Perfect'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The text of Bill Simon Jr.'s comments Thursday in Los Angeles about
his incorrect assertion that Gray Davis had illegally accepted a
campaign donation in his state office follow. Simon's comments at
Town Hall Los Angeles were his first on the matter, although his
campaign acknowledged Wednesday night that the allegations were
unfounded.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   When I entered this race, I looked forward to the debate on the
issues, and I looked forward to the possibility of putting forward my
ideas to the people of California, and having a good and vigorous
dialogue about the issues. But unfortunately, this
campaign--especially during the course of the last couple months
--has really been seriously sidetracked. I've been the subject of a
barrage of attacks from Gray Davis. He's attacked literally all
aspects of my life--my business, my charity, my family, and even,
more recently, my late father.</LD>
<TE>   At the debate on Monday, I started out ... by asking the governor
to please apologize to the people of California for the type of
campaign that he was running, in addition to the type of job that he
was doing as governor. Also, at that debate, I asked the governor if
he ever accepted a campaign contribution in a government office
building. I want to be clear today, ladies and gentleman, because
there may be a question in your minds. I asked that question because
my campaign was aware--through a credible law enforcement
organization who was formally in the process of filing a complaint
with the Fair Political Practices Commission--that the governor had
done exactly that. And I knew that this organization, by taking these
exact steps, was really implicating itself, in addition, so I knew
that they were taking this matter extraordinarily seriously.</TE>
<TE>   They also assured my campaign that they had documentary evidence
that supported this violation, evidence that they insisted was
accurate, and they would be making this definitive evidence available
at a later date to the public.</TE>
<TE>   It now appears, yesterday, that the organization's allegation
against the governor was wrong, and that their evidence does not hold
up, and that our faith in their assurances was misplaced. So I want
to just say quite clearly today, in the spirit of my request to the
governor for an apology, I find it necessary to express to everyone
my sincere regret for the way this matter was handled.</TE>
<TE>   Now, many of you may have seen my latest commercial, where I say
I'm not perfect, and that's indeed true. Now we know, of course, my
campaign is not perfect. The only one that's perfect that I know of
at this point is my wife, Cindy.</TE>
<TE>   But I must say that this mistake was made because to us, the
charge was a credible one.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Bus Driver Describes Holding Down Suicide Bomber</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>An Israeli bus driver trying to resuscitate a fallen passenger who
had attempted to board through a closing door opened the man's shirt
and discovered wires leading to a bomb.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian bomber managed to kill himself and an elderly
Israeli woman despite efforts by the driver and other passengers to
foil the bombing.</LD>
<LD>   One of the odder suicide bombings in the last two years, the
incident Thursday near Tel Aviv came during a spike in fighting
throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. During a raid in the Rafah
refugee camp in Gaza, Israeli troops shot dead two Palestinians, one
of them a 12-year-old boy.</LD>
<TE>   "We've said we're deeply troubled by the recent upsurge of
violence in the region," U.S. State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said. "We've looked to both sides to take steps that can end
the violence."</TE>
<TE>   The suicide bomber was identified as Rafik Hamad, 31, a father of
four children from the West Bank town of Hable. The incident took
place during the morning rush hour in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei
Brak, not far from Bar Ilan University. Baruch Neuman, the Dan Bus
Co. driver on line 87, was pulling out of a bus stop with a full load
of passengers when a man tried to jump through the closing back door,
lost his balance and banged his head on the pavement.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers thought the man was a frantic commuter late for work,
and so did the driver.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, this of course isn't how people normally board a bus, but I
didn't think this was a terrorist," Neuman, who escaped unharmed,
recalled on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Neuman, 50, pulled his hand brake and jumped out to see what had
happened. A female medic who was also a passenger followed and
started to unbutton the man's shirt to administer first aid.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time she reached the third button, we saw that something
wasn't right," Neuman said. "A fraction of a second later, it
clicked."</TE>
<TE>   He and the medic jumped on the barely conscious man and pinned his
arms and legs to the ground. They screamed for other people to run
away from the area. But the bomber soon began to wriggle free.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw wires sticking out toward his pants, and we knew the
crucial moment was approaching," Neuman said.</TE>
<TE>   The bus driver and the medic let go simultaneously and made a run
for it. The bomber stood up, staggered a few feet and then blew up.</TE>
<TE>   The bus driver and police were unable to explain how it was that
the Israeli woman killed, 71-year-old Saada Aharon, did not manage to
get away. Twelve people were injured, but not critically.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas, a militant Islamic movement, took responsibility for the
bombing. It said the attack was to avenge a deadly Israeli raid
Monday morning on the Gaza city of Khan Yunis that left at least 16
people dead and also a July attack against a Hamas leader.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is in the midst of a renewed push to crack down on Hamas,
and more attempted bombings are expected in the coming days.</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza City, meanwhile, 20,000 Palestinian police officers and
militiamen marched in a funeral for a police colonel who was slain by
Hamas members Monday, Associated Press reported. Hamas said the
killing was an independent act, but many activists in Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement blame Hamas
itself, and their march was a show of force.</TE>
<TE>   A banner the marchers carried read: "All factions have to respect
the Palestinian Authority, the only legitimate authority."</TE>

<LD>A lawyer appointed to help ensure a fair trial for Slobodan Milosevic
in The Hague was fired for giving interviews that war crimes judges
said suggested bias against the former Yugoslav president.</LD>
<LD>   Michail Wladimiroff was quoted in a Dutch newspaper last month as
saying prosecutors had already produced enough evidence to secure a
conviction on charges related to Kosovo. And a Bulgarian magazine
quoted Wladimiroff as saying Milosevic's chances of being cleared
were "negligible."</LD>
<LD>   Judges had named Wladimiroff and two other attorneys for Milosevic
after he refused defense counsel.</LD>

<HD>Moroccan Allegedly Linked to Al Qaeda Arrested in Germany</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JEFFREY FLEISHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>A Moroccan with alleged ties to Al Qaeda training camps and to the
terrorist cell that plotted the Sept. 11 attacks was arrested in
Hamburg on Thursday as German police continued their search for those
who provide logistical and financial support to extremist networks.</LD>
<LD>   Abdelghani Mzoudi is not suspected of belonging to the inner
circle of the terrorist group led by Mohamed Atta, the Egyptian
believed to have piloted the Boeing 767 that struck the north tower
of the World Trade Center. But over the years, according to
prosecutors, Mzoudi had contacts with the Sept. 11 hijackers and
received terrorist training in Afghanistan in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities allege that Mzoudi had connections to Mounir
Motassadeq, who faces trial Oct. 22 on charges of managing a bank
account that "transferred large sums of money" to members of Atta's
extremist group. Mzoudi also shared a Hamburg apartment with
suspected terrorists Zakariya Essabar and Ramzi Binalshibh. Essabar
remains a fugitive; Binalshibh was arrested in Pakistan last month
and is in U.S. custody.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Mzoudi "was aware of the aim of the group to
commit terrorist attacks and supported it logistically." He is
charged with supporting a terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   Surveillance of Mzoudi began a year ago, when Hamburg
police--stunned that several of the Sept. 11 hijackers once lived in
the city--began wiretapping suspected radicals. Part of the
investigation focused on the Attawhid bookshop, where, police allege,
Mzoudi discussed extremists views with seven other Muslim men from
Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistan. The bookstore and homes of the men
were raided, but police determined that only Mzoudi had a strong link
to Atta and his group.</TE>
<TE>   The police portray Mzoudi as close to, but not at the center of,
the group. There is no evidence yet released suggesting that he had
been considered for membership in the group of suicide attackers.</TE>
<TE>   However, prosecutors alleged that the 29-year-old suspect helped
find an apartment for Marwan Al-Shehhi before the militant left
Germany in mid-2000 to enroll in a Florida flight school. Authorities
believe that Al-Shehhi was flying the Boeing 767 that hit the south
tower of the trade center.</TE>
<TE>   Mzoudi is also suspected of attempting to arrange financing for
Essabar to receive pilot training. Essabar failed to obtain a U.S.
visa and later disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say that Mzoudi, Essabar and Motassadeq underwent
terrorist training in Afghanistan during the summer of 2000. They
allegedly were instructed by Al Qaeda leaders in providing cover and
logistical support for the Hamburg cell.</TE>
<TE>   Mzoudi came in contact with Atta at least twice, police say. The
men appear in a video taken during the 1999 wedding of terrorism
suspect and fugitive Said Bahaji. And on April 11, 1996, Mzoudi and
Motassadeq signed Atta's will at the Al Quds mosque in Hamburg. In an
interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel last Oct. 21, Mzoudi
said he knew Atta from the library at the Technical University of
Hamburg-Harburg, where both attended classes. He said that he and
Atta prayed together at various mosques and that he moved into Atta's
room after the latter left Hamburg for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he was a strict Muslim, Mzoudi told Der Spiegel:
"Strict or not strict, I can't hear it anymore. There are just
Muslims and those who are not. There is nothing in between."</TE>
<TE>   "Atta was so soft," he added. "I never thought a Muslim could do
such a thing. A Muslim shouldn't kill children, old people and
women."</TE>
<TE>   With 3.5 million Muslims, Germany became an ideal crossroads for
terrorists traveling between the Middle East and the United States.
Authorities believe that many of them passed through Hamburg, where
much of the Islamic community lives in segregated neighborhoods
supported by 50 mosques. Officials believe that 1,000
extremists--including 100 who are considered dangerous--remain active
in the port city.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very difficult society to penetrate," said Heino
Vahldiek, head of Hamburg's domestic intelligence agency. "They speak
in codes, and now that they know the state is watching them, they are
keeping a low profile."</TE>

<HD>Ruling Party's Long Run Is Over in Kashmir</HD>
<DH>India: State election results spark calls for a new era. A
coalition government is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAR VILLAGE, India</DL>
<LD>The political party that ruled Jammu and Kashmir state for the last
half a century was humiliated at the polls Thursday, sparking calls
for a new style in governing the region that has been racked by a
Muslim insurgency.</LD>
<LD>   No party earned a majority in the 87-seat local legislature,
paving the way for a coalition to replace the old guard. Kashmiris
expressed hope that fresh faces could bring an era of openness and
assist talks between nuclear powers India and Pakistan, who have
fought two wars over the disputed territory.</LD>
<LD>   Particularly jarring for the ruling National Conference
party--which has been criticized as arrogant, corrupt and inept--was
the defeat of Omar Abdullah, its leader, son of the current chief
minister and grandson of the party's founder.</LD>
<TE>   A dozen cars, trucks and buses were packed with supporters--many
hanging off the roofs--who cheered and celebrated the downfall of a
political dynasty and the victory by Qazi Mohammed Afzal of the
People's Democratic Party, or PDP.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ecstatic," said Ali Mohammed Rather, 52, a Lar Village
resident. "We're really happy to be the ones to cut off the head of
the National Conference. We'll be celebrating until at least tomorrow
night."</TE>
<TE>   The closely watched state election was a drawn-out process
involving about 90,000 security and polling officials, four voting
rounds and more than 800 deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian government called the elections a victory for
democracy, and many Kashmiris said polling was much cleaner than in
1996 and 1987. Analysts said the relatively high 44% turnout, despite
gunfire and harassment, was driven by anti-National Conference
sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first bit of good news in Kashmir in a long time,"
said Mohammed Ayub, a 26-year-old government worker. "I feel like my
vote finally means something."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has condemned the election as a sham and called instead
for a U.N. plebiscite on whether Kashmir should join Pakistan or
become independent.</TE>
<TE>   Noor Ahmed Baba, a political scientist with the University of
Kashmir, said Kashmiris voted for local change and were not endorsing
control by either India or Pakistan. "Many people in Kashmir have
been cynical of both sides," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Heartening to some were reports that several independent
candidates were secretly representing Islamic separatist groups,
suggesting a timid early step toward the ballot over the bullet.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-incumbent vote mirrors changes seen nationwide over the
last decade as state voters have become increasingly impatient with
politics as usual.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of any clear winner Thursday quickly fueled speculation
about a future coalition--and the likely promises, money and dirty
deals under discussion behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   In unofficial results, the National Conference secured 28
seats--compared with the 57 it had--the rival Congress Party won 20
and the local opposition PDP won 16. The remaining 23 went to smaller
parties.</TE>
<TE>   The PDP has called for rolling back draconian laws that give
security forces in Kashmir broad authority to detain suspects without
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Samiena Begun, 65, of Lar Village said her son was severely beaten
in 1999 by security forces after strongly petitioning top state
officials for a job. Others tell similar stories, which could not be
verified.</TE>
<TE>   But Pervez Imroz, president of the Assn. of Parents of Disappeared
Persons, a civic group based in Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar,
said he's not optimistic. Many alleged abuses by security forces
aren't subject to state control, he said.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 6,000 Kashmiris have vanished--the state has
acknowledged 3,155--at the hands of security forces, Imroz said.</TE>
<TE>   "If armed forces can continue to act with impunity because they're
seen as fighting a patriotic war, the disappearances won't stop," he
said. "I hope I'm wrong, but the human rights abuses will likely
continue."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the drama Thursday centered around National Conference
chief Abdullah, 32, and why his party failed so badly. About noon,
shortly after he entered the vote-counting center to watch his
presumed victory, votes started coming in the other way. As the media
hounded him for a comment, his face dropped.</TE>
<TE>   "The heavens fell on my head," he said after regaining his
composure, adding that the people's will was clear and his party
would not try to join the coalition.</TE>
<TE>   A major handicap for Abdullah was his relatively low profile and
outsider reputation. Despite being part of such a powerful family,
the articulate scion isn't fluent in the Kashmiri language and has
spent most of his time in national politics in New Delhi. Born in
Britain to a British mother, he was educated in Scotland and
Srinagar.</TE>
<TE>   Around Lar Village, residents chanted, hugged and took part in
traditional folk dances to celebrate the National Conference
trouncing. A small courtyard in the winning candidate's house became
so jammed that people climbed onto the roof and mobbed the street
outside to be part of the historic moment. Fireworks caused heads to
turn in a region that has grown wary of gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Abdul Rachid, the winning candidate's brother, held court
as a string of well-wishers entered the front room to congratulate
him and sip tea after stopping to remove their shoes outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Let us begin anew, toward peace and friendship," he said. "With a
fair election, India has taken a step to rebuild confidence in
Kashmir. But this is only the first step, and there are many more
ahead."</TE>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>About 1 million Venezuelans marched here Thursday to demand that
President Hugo Chavez call early elections or a referendum on his
rule--threatening a general strike if he didn't do so by Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Venezuela's biggest labor and business groups responded to the
clamor immediately, announcing an Oct. 21 strike if Chavez didn't
meet Wednesday's deadline.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez, whose term ends in 2007, will respond to the threat during
a rally Sunday, said Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel.</LD>
<TE>   Organizers and Caracas Fire Chief Rodolfo Briceno estimated that 1
million people attended the demonstration in the capital, the largest
since troops and Chavez supporters confronted an opposition march on
the presidential palace April 11.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting that day killed at least 14 people and prompted a two-day
military coup before loyalist troops restored Chavez to power.</TE>

<HD>Hungarian Holocaust Survivor Is Awarded Nobel in Literature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Hungarian writer Imre Kertesz, a survivor of Auschwitz who made the
experience of the Holocaust a central theme of his work, won the
Nobel Prize in literature Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing the award, the Swedish Academy singled out Kertesz's
1975 debut novel, "Fateless," the semiautobiographical story of a boy
sent to Nazi concentration camps who conforms and survives--partly by
developing an extraordinary detachment from what is happening to him.
In the novel, the terrifying reality of the camps is taken for
granted, as a given of the hero's situation.</LD>
<LD>   "The shocking credibility of the description derives perhaps from
this very absence of any element of the moral indignation or
metaphysical protest that the subject cries out for," the academy
said.</LD>
<TE>   Kertesz's writing also carries a broader symbolism, the academy
said, exploring how one can live and think as an individual when
people are severely repressed by society. His work "upholds the
fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric
arbitrariness of history," it said. "For him, Auschwitz is not an
exceptional occurrence. It is the ultimate truth about human
degradation in modern experience."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters in Berlin, where he is on a fellowship, the
72-year-old prizewinner said he felt "a mixture of surprise and joy."</TE>
<TE>   "I am interested in totalitarianism, in what a dictatorship can
easily do to people, and how does the human being change under it,"
Kertesz said. "I didn't want to write an anti-fascist novel. I just
wrote what happened."</TE>
<TE>   A Jew born in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, Kertesz was
deported in 1944 to Auschwitz, the death camp in Nazi-occupied
Poland. He later was moved to the Buchenwald camp in Germany, where
he was liberated in 1945. About 6 million Jews were killed in the
Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, Kertesz returned to Hungary. He worked as a
journalist beginning in 1948 but was dismissed in 1951 when his paper
adopted the Communist Party line. After that, he supported himself as
a writer and translator.</TE>
<TE>   In "Fateless," the hero describes riding a train to Buchenwald
under "the usual circumstances of such trips."</TE>
<TE>   "My body was still there," the hero explains. "I was thoroughly
familiar with it, only somehow I myself no longer lived inside it.
Without any difficulty I sensed that my body lay there surrounded on
the sides and above with other objects. On the cold floor of the
rattling railroad car the straw was wet from a variety of suspicious
fluids.</TE>
<TE>   "I sensed that my paper bandages had long since torn apart and
disappeared, that my shirt and convict's pants, which they had put on
me for the journey, were sticking to my wounds. But all this no
longer moved me, no longer interested me, no longer held any sway
over me. Indeed, I have to say that a lot of time had passed since I
had experienced this easy, peaceful, and--to call a spade a
spade--comfortable quiet.</TE>
<TE>   "After all, I had finally become rid of the pain of irritability:
The bodies pressing against mine no longer disturbed me. Somehow I
was even glad that they were there with me, that their bodies and
mine were so connected and so similar."</TE>
<TE>   The first Hungarian to win the literature prize, worth about $1
million, Kertesz said he considered it recognition for his years of
writing "Holocaust and anti-dictatorship literature.... Maybe this
will lead to something educational for the Eastern European states."</TE>
<TE>   "The Holocaust is a condition that is not finished," he said. "I
feel it everywhere. There hasn't been a catharsis. One cannot digest
the Holocaust."</TE>
<TE>   But Kertesz, who has spent years translating German literature and
philosophy into Hungarian, stressed that he is "not angry at
Germany."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm angry at the Nazis," he said. "Now there is a third
generation that had nothing to do with Nazism."</TE>
<TE>   German President Johannes Rau congratulated Kertesz, telling him,
"I'm deeply moved you have done so much to promote German culture in
Hungary in spite of your horrible experience in German concentration
camps."</TE>
<TE>   Hungarian President Ferenc Madl also sent a congratulatory note:
"Your life is proof that the soul always has reserves, which we call
faith. And it gives strength to all of us."</TE>
<TE>   "Fateless" was the first of a trilogy reflecting on the Holocaust.
In "Fiasco," published in 1988, an aging author writes a novel about
Auschwitz, expecting it to be rejected. To his surprise, it is
published, leaving him feeling a sense of emptiness and a loss of
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Kaddish for a Child Not Born," published in 1990, is narrated by
a middle-aged Holocaust survivor who, like Kertesz, is a writer and
literary translator. Kaddish, a Jewish prayer for the dead, is said
by the protagonist for the child he refuses to beget in the cruel
world that allowed Auschwitz to exist.</TE>
<TE>   Receiving the Nobel Prize also gives a boost to plans for Kertesz
to help make a film based on "Fateless," working with Hungarian
cinematographer Lajos Koltai.</TE>
<TE>   Kertesz survived the camps because "he had a totally different
point of view," Koltai said. Both the hero of "Fateless" and Kertesz
"tried to catch the good moments also; otherwise, you can't get
through," he explained, citing as examples the beauty of sunsets and
the smell of soup.</TE>
<TE>   Kertesz "is always showing the small people against the power,"
Koltai said.</TE>
<TE>   The author, he added, explores the question "How can you be a
human being in silence--inside yourself--against the power that's
stepping over you?"</TE>

<LD>An excerpt from "Fateless" (1975), written by Imre Kertesz and
translated from the Hungarian by Associated Press:</LD>
<LD>   Buchenwald lies in a region of mountains and valleys, on the spine
of an elevation. Its air is clean. All eyes are delighted by the
diverse landscape, the encircling forests, the red tile-roofed
village houses in the valley below. The baths lie to the left. The
prisoners are mostly friendly, although in a different way than in
Auschwitz. Upon arrival, here too, you are met by a bath, barbers,
disinfectant fluids and a change of clothes. The accessories of the
cloakroom are exactly the same as in Auschwitz.</LD>
<LD>   But the bath is warmer, the barbers do their work more
meticulously, and the cloakroom attendant, even if just by a fleeting
glance, tries to size up your measurements. Then it's into the
hallway, before sliding glass windows, and they inquire whether you
have any gold teeth. Then, a compatriot of yours who has been here
longer and even has hair writes your name in a big book. He gives you
a yellow triangle, a wide strip and a band, both made of cloth. In
the middle of the triangle there is a letter U, a sign that you are,
after all, also Hungarian. The band has a printed number on it; mine,
for example, is 64921.</LD>

<HD>Musharraf Allies Wrestle Party of Former Premier</HD>
<DH>Election: Supporters of president run neck and neck with
Benazir Bhutto's faction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>As workers counted millions of ballots Thursday, early unofficial
results in the first general election since a 1999 coup suggested
that allies of President Pervez Musharraf were locked in a tight race
with the leading opposition party for control of parliament.</LD>
<LD>   Exit polls and projections based on initial counting of ballots
for the National Assembly's 342 seats showed the Pakistan People's
Party of exiled former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto holding a slight
lead over the Pakistan Muslim League-Q, a staunch Musharraf ally that
broke away from a major party.</LD>
<LD>   The first official results today gave a majority in the North-West
Frontier province legislature to a coalition of six Islamic parties,
whose campaign criticized the U.S. and praised the former Taliban
regime in neighboring Afghanistan. The alliance, the Muttahida
Majlis-i-Amal, also ran strongly in the National Assembly vote and
was well ahead of the founding PML faction headed by exiled former
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for third place.</LD>
<TE>   The election commission has not released any official results,
which are not expected until later today at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   Although only indications of a trend, the early counting appeared
to support polls that predicted Bhutto's party and the PML-Q would be
the main contenders for control of the National Assembly. The
original PML has promised to support Bhutto's group in a coalition
government if--as expected--no party wins an outright majority.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, an army general who seized power in the bloodless 1999
coup and a key ally in the U.S.-declared war on terrorism, says he
will hand over executive powers Nov. 1 to a prime minister selected
by the newly elected National Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   However, Musharraf will remain president and military commander.
He has granted himself the constitutional power to dismiss the prime
minister and legislature as he chooses. The military also will be
able to supervise elected politicians through a new National Security
Council, critics complain.</TE>
<TE>   About 72 million Pakistanis were eligible to vote at 60,000
polling stations, but the turnout was reported to be low in most of
the country. Only 34% of eligible voters cast ballots in 1997 during
Pakistan's last general election. At least seven people died Thursday
in election-related violence.</TE>
<TE>   There were no indications of the wholesale ballot stuffing that
Pakistanis witnessed in April, when Musharraf held a referendum to
confirm himself as president for another five years.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign election observers are withholding judgment on whether
Thursday's voting for the National Assembly and four provincial
legislatures were free or fair, until after final results are
released.</TE>
<TE>   However, opposition parties and human rights groups, including New
York-based Human Rights Watch, accused Musharraf's government of
trying to rig the election to produce an obedient National Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "In the three years since the coup, Pakistan has witnessed a
consolidation of military power rather than a transition to
democracy," said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division
of Human Rights Watch. "Pakistan's international partners cannot
ignore this fact any longer."</TE>
<TE>   The group called on Musharraf to rescind constitutional amendments
that he imposed to, among other things, create the National Security
Council, which critics claim will give armed forces commanders a
permanent role in government.</TE>
<TE>   Human Rights Watch also urged foreign governments to cut off
military aid to Pakistan until Musharraf "implements meaningful
democratic reforms." To reward Musharraf for supporting its war on
terrorism, Washington lifted military sanctions imposed after
Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government has authorized the sale of about $400 million
in military equipment to Pakistan, including aircraft and Harpoon
missiles, Human Rights Watch said. So far, Washington hasn't joined
in the criticism of Pakistan's elections.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an important milestone in Pakistan's ongoing transition
to democracy, and we will continue to watch this process closely,"
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Thursday in
Washington. "We are committed to remaining engaged with Pakistan
throughout this transition."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government hopes that Thursday's polls, and the vote for
a new state government in the Indian-controlled portion of the
disputed Kashmir region, will open the way to peace talks between
India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The two nuclear neighbors each lay claim to the Himalayan region,
and India accuses Pakistan of allowing militants to cross their
border and the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee repeated this week that
an end to what he calls cross-border terrorism is essential before
talks can begin with Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Although the absence of high-profile political figures in the
election contributed to a low turnout, voters weren't apathetic in
the Pushtun tribal areas of Pakistan administered by the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   They won the right to "one person, one vote" only before the last
general election in 1997. Before that, voting and holding elected
office were reserved almost exclusively for members of the hereditary
ruling class, called Maliks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, traditions die hard, and the wealthiest tribal areas put
their relatives forward as candidates. The region bordering
Afghanistan is deeply conservative and has resisted outside
interference for centuries.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. suspects some local tribesmen of giving safe haven to Al
Qaeda and Taliban fighters moving in and out of Afghanistan to wage a
guerrilla war against U.S. and other coalition troops and their
Afghan allies.</TE>
<TE>   Many of northwestern Pakistan's Pushtuns resent clandestine U.S.
military support for Pakistani troops hunting down the fighters.
Their anger was expected to translate into votes for candidates from
a coalition of six Muslim parties.</TE>
<TE>   In Bara, there were long lines of men outside polling stations,
but separate ones set aside for women were deserted. It was the same
throughout the Khyber district and elsewhere in the Pushtun tribal
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have decided not to get our women's vote polled," said
Maulana Khalil-ur-Rehman, a popular candidate from the religious
coalition, called the United Council of Action.</TE>

<HD>Israel Targets Pro-Iraq Palestinians Over Money Gifts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Israeli security forces have launched a crackdown on a faction of
pro-Iraqi Palestinians, charging that it is helping Saddam Hussein
foment violence by giving money to families of suicide bombers.</LD>
<LD>   Documents released this week by Israeli intelligence sources
showed hundreds of payments that Israel says total $15 million to
Palestinians whose relatives were injured or killed, including some
suicide bombers. Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan personally
directed the transfer of funds through an Iraqi bank in Jordan,
according to the documents.</LD>
<LD>   Rakad Salem, the secretary-general of the Arab Liberation Front, a
small pro-Iraqi political party that distributed the checks, was
arrested Oct. 2 at his office in the West Bank city of Ramallah. He
was expected to be tried in a closed military court in Jerusalem on
charges of supporting terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Most families of the dead received $10,000, but those of suicide
bombers often got as much as $25,000--the more generous grant
awarded, as one of the documents put it, "according to the decision
of Commander Saddam Hussein ... in appreciation of their bravery."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the infrastructure of terrorism that Iraq established in
the [Palestinian] territories," said an Israeli security official,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The directions came
directly from [Iraqi President] Saddam Hussein and his deputy."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials say the crackdown is unrelated to rising
tensions with Iraq and is simply a matter of accumulating the
evidence. Some of the documents were seized during an Aug. 25 raid of
Arab Liberation Front offices in the West Bank city of Tulkarm. But
the timing is curious in that the Arab Liberation Front has been very
public in its activities for nearly two years. The checks are
typically distributed with much fanfare at public rallies in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "The claims of the Israeli government about Saddam's support for
Palestinians is part of the American campaign against Iraq. The
Israelis want to speed up the military attack on Iraq," Ibrahim
Zainan, a Gaza-based official with the Arab Liberation Front told the
Palestinian newspaper Al Ayyam. He said that the organization plans
to distribute an additional $1 million Monday to families of victims.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, Arab Liberation Front offices are closed and its
senior personnel are keeping a low profile in anticipation of more
arrests. One senior official of the political party, who spoke on the
condition that he not be named, said that seven members were arrested
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The official disputed the Israeli assertion that the money Iraq is
distributing is tantamount to encouraging terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "This is charity that we are giving to a family that has lost
their son or daughter. Somebody who is going to sacrifice himself is
not thinking about money. It is about their soul," the official said.
He did not, however, deny Israel's complaint that the largest checks
were going to families of suicide bombers. "The one who takes the
initiative to be killed is worth more than someone who is killed
sitting inside their house," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The documents that Israel released included copies of checks to
families of some of the deadliest bombers, such as Fuad Hurani, who
killed 11 people March 9 in a Jerusalem cafe. His mother received
$25,000 in June, according to the papers. Detailed lists classify the
recipients into families of successful suicide bombers, families of
suicide bombers who managed only to kill themselves, and families of
those who were killed in other sorts of incidents.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis acknowledged that there was no evidence of payments
being received before suicide bombings, but they maintain that the
prospect of bombers' families receiving the money afterward is still
an inducement.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorists who plan to kill themselves know their families
will get money, and that adds to their motivation," the Israeli
security source said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Saudi Arabia is giving payments of $5,300 to families
of Palestinians killed in the violence, but it does not make
distinctions about how they were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have every indication that the Iraqis are eager for things to
escalate here in order to interfere with U.S. planning," said Eran
Lehrman, a former Israeli intelligence official.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Palestinian uprising began in September 2000, Iraq has
evacuated Palestinians for medical treatment and sent aid. Iraq has
also provided grants of up to $25,000 for Palestinians whose houses
were bulldozed by Israel in the West Bank city of Jenin.</TE>

<HD>Bin Laden CD Offered in Qatar</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Publishing company hawks an $8 disc featuring
footage of the Al Qaeda leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DOHA, Qatar</DL>
<LD>The latest CD to hit the streets may not yet be No. 1, but it is
climbing the charts.</LD>
<LD>   For about $8, Qataris can buy a 70-minute disc featuring Osama bin
Laden discussing his views and urging forceful action against the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   The CD includes footage already seen on Arab-language network Al
Jazeera and some that has never been broadcast, according to Dar Al
Sharq Printing, Publishing &amp; Distribution, which is distributing the
disc as part of a deal with the network.</LD>
<TE>   "We think many people will want to see and study this CD," said
Mohammed Shareef, an official with Dar Al Sharq. "Sales are good
today."</TE>
<TE>   Dar Al Sharq is the parent company of the Al Sharq newspaper and
the English-language daily the Peninsula. The two papers carried
front-page announcements with the headline "Dar Al Sharq to Market
Osama CDs Globally."</TE>
<TE>   A journalist with one of the papers said the deal was "strictly
business and information" and does not show any sympathy for Bin
Laden's anti-U.S. views. The journalist, who asked not to be
identified, noted that U.S. newspapers often publish special sections
or books carrying the full texts of historic documents, such as the
official investigation into President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Although Al Jazeera has sold copies of Bin Laden videos to other
media outlets, the CD is thought to be the first venture to make
these images available to the public. The disc also includes footage
of U.S. military action in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar-based Al Jazeera has repeatedly scooped other media by
obtaining Bin Laden tapes, although it has often been unclear whether
the tapes were recorded before or after the Sept. 11 attacks. Whether
Bin Laden is alive continues to be a matter of debate.</TE>
<TE>   The Bin Laden CD also illustrates one difference between Qatar and
most of its Persian Gulf neighbors. Few nations in the region would
allow sales of a CD that contains explosive political viewpoints
adamantly opposed by the government.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar's ruling emir, Sheik Hamad ibn Khalifa al Thani, supports
the U.S. offensive in Afghanistan and has allowed the U.S. military
to use the mammoth Al Udeid Air Base outside the capital city.</TE>
<TE>   But Hamad also has allowed a freer media in Qatar than under his
father-predecessor, whom he deposed in 1995 before immediately
launching a pro-Western modernization drive. Hamad abolished the
Ministry of Information and ended formal censorship, although
journalists continue to practice self-censorship, according to the

<HD>Tanker Blast Likely a Terror Attack, French Say</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Debris indicates a small boat apparently was used
to attack the ship off Yemen. The U.S. sees the incident as part of a
new campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA and ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Investigators have discovered strong signs that an explosion that
damaged a French oil tanker off the coast of Yemen this week and
killed one sailor resulted from an attack by terrorists using a small
boat, French authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. intelligence officials in Washington concurred, saying they
believe that the attack Sunday on the French supertanker Limburg was
part of a broad new terrorist campaign against American and allied
interests in the Middle East that may involve Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   Despite initial claims by Yemeni officials that the explosion was
accidental, French investigators working with U.S. and Yemeni
counterparts Thursday aboard the Limburg found pieces of wood, metal
and other materials believed to be debris from another boat,
according to French law enforcement and diplomatic officials.</LD>
<TE>   The physical evidence reinforces the account of a sailor who said
he saw a small vessel about to ram the tanker Sunday morning just
before the explosion, which caused a massive fire and spilled about
90,000 barrels of oil.</TE>
<TE>   "The preliminary results of the inquiry conducted by French,
Yemeni and American investigators lead us to believe that the
explosion suffered by the French oil tanker Limburg was due to an
attack," the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday
night. "The course of the inquiry will enable the verification of
these first results and determine the exact causes of this
explosion."</TE>
<TE>   The clues were found as investigators scoured the tanker's hold in
the area of a gaping hole near the waterline. Experts from France's
leading anti-terrorism agency, the DST, determined that the materials
were consistent with a small boat and suggested a seagoing attack
with explosives, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "They found pieces of wood and of other materials that apparently
come from a small boat," a French law enforcement official said.
"This was an intentional act. This looks more and more like a
terrorist attack."</TE>
<TE>   The investigators also found metallic debris at the blast site
that they suspect came from such a craft, another French official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. naval investigators confirmed that pieces of a small boat
were inside the Limburg, according to a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The tanker's hull was bent inward, according
to the official--further evidence of an attack.</TE>
<TE>   "There are clearly signs of a terrorist attack," said a U.S.
intelligence official familiar with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   France put its diplomatic facilities in the Middle East and other
trouble spots on alert Thursday and said the government would provide
additional protection for French ships.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion in the Gulf of Aden appears to be part of a recent
wave of attacks and heightened activity around the world attributed
to the Al Qaeda terrorist network and its sympathizers, according to
French and U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The method and location recall a bombing two years ago that killed
17 sailors aboard the U.S. destroyer Cole, which was struck by an
explosives-laden boat steered by suicide terrorists off the coast of
Yemen. U.S. officials blamed Al Qaeda for that attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Limburg incident came only a week before the second
anniversary of the assault on the Cole. A senior French law
enforcement official said that although it was too early to blame Al
Qaeda, such symbolic timing has been a signature of the group.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. official said the blast on the Limburg has all the
hallmarks of an Al Qaeda operation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's harder for just one or two individuals to conduct an attack
like that; it takes a lot more coordination and effort," the official
said. "It does seem to be pointing to an attack like that on the
Cole."</TE>
<TE>   If that is true, the bombing could confirm recent grim portents.
European and U.S. counter-terrorism experts have warned for months
that oil tankers were prime targets of terrorists bent on economic
disruption and mayhem. There was a threat of attacks on French
interests in a recently aired tape of the voice of fugitive Ayman
Zawahiri, the alleged right-hand man of Osama bin Laden. And recent
intelligence intercepts described by U.S. justice officials indicated
that Al Qaeda was gearing up for more terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, suspected Islamic extremists killed a Marine on Tuesday
during a military exercise in Kuwait, though the U.S. official said
Thursday that it is not clear whether that shooting might be tied to
the explosion in Yemen or directly to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Yemeni officials spent the first days after the Limburg blast
denying allegations of terrorism, as they did after the October 2000
attack on the Cole. But they backtracked Thursday, saying terrorism
was a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   A Yemeni terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda has claimed
responsibility for the Limburg blast. French authorities will
consider that claim seriously, but they have no information yet with
which to evaluate its credibility, a French diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   The Belgian-owned Limburg was carrying about 400,000 barrels of
Saudi crude oil and a crew of 25 when it erupted in flames near the
port of Mina Dabah. A Bulgarian sailor drowned after jumping
overboard to escape the fire.</TE>
<TE>   The captain and the owners insisted that the tanker had been
attacked. They said at least one crewman described seeing a speedboat
or fishing craft bearing down on the right side and then disappearing
in the blast. The captain also said that an electrical malfunction,
the theory of some Yemeni officials, could not have caused a blast of
that size in a well-maintained, double-hulled tanker.</TE>
<TE>   The targeting of a French ship is another example that France
remains in the cross hairs of terrorists along with the United
States. A suicide bombing May 8 killed 11 French engineers in
Karachi, Pakistan. Al Qaeda allegedly tried to simultaneously hit
France and the U.S. last year in foiled attacks by "shoe bomber"
Richard Reid on an American Airlines flight from Paris and by a
Tunisian cell accused of plotting to bomb the U.S. Embassy in the
French capital.</TE>
<TE>   Though France has worked closely with the U.S. in the fight
against terrorism, the Yemeni case is not likely to affect its
opposition to U.S. plans to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, French officials--and most European law
enforcement officials--reject the claims by the Bush administration
of significant links between Al Qaeda and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   French leaders also worry that a war with Iraq would inflame
tensions in the Middle East, provoke more terrorism and impede the
law enforcement campaign against Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, U.S. critics of President Bush's policies saw the bad
news from Yemen as a sign that the administration has changed focus
too soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly reinforces those who have been worrying that Iraq
has been diverting us from the real war on terrorism," said Joseph
Cirincione, a security expert at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in Washington. "It may be a harbinger of things
to come in the coming weeks. That is, multiple small-scale terrorist
attacks. It tends to increase the concerns of those who worry that a
war in Iraq would generate a whole new generation of Al Qaeda
recruits."</TE>

<HD>Davis' Drive Has Been Unswerving</HD>
<DH>Profile: Long climb has displayed pragmatism and
perseverance, but not always expedience.</DH>
<SE>Second in a series profiling Gov. Gray Davis.</SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1994, Gray Davis faced a major career decision. Fresh off a
disastrous U.S. Senate campaign, his choice was to seek a third term
as state controller or surrender that safe seat to run for the less
powerful post of lieutenant governor.</LD>
<LD>   He chose the latter, saying he wished to be "an ambassador
of hope" at a time when California was economically flat on its back.
But that was not really his motive.</LD>
<LD>   For years, Davis had plotted his return to the governor's office,
where he had served as Jerry Brown's chief of staff and, in Brown's
frequent absences, as California's de facto chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   Through much of 1993, Davis met with strategists and supporters,
pondering his future. Some, like his wife, Sharon, saw the lieutenant
governor's position as a step down. As controller, Davis was
California's chief financial officer, a job he turned into a
high-profile platform for environmental activism and abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis was convinced the lieutenant governor's post was the
best perch from which to reach the next rung, according to several of
those involved in the strategy sessions. The office looked better on
a resume. Fewer duties meant more time for politics. And winning a
new office would be a validation of sorts after he had lost badly to
fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein in the 1992 Senate primary.</TE>
<TE>   The job switch proved a shrewd one. Davis easily won the
lieutenant governor's race and four years later became governor. His
title was a big asset, voters told his campaign researchers,
conveying a reassuring sense of experience and Sacramento know-how.</TE>
<TE>   The path he followed says much about the way Davis has approached
politics and policy during his 25-plus years in public life.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, he has hewed to a handful of beliefs,
including support for the death penalty and gay rights, that have not
always been the most politically expedient positions.</TE>
<TE>   As Brown's top aide, Davis was vital to enacting environmental
legislation and opening the ranks of state government to women and
minorities. In the Legislature, he championed the cause of missing
children, putting their faces on billboards, bus stops and milk
cartons. As controller and then lieutenant governor, he fought
offshore oil drilling and took on the tobacco industry when other
politicians balked. His consistent moderate-to-conservative views
predated the national Democratic Party's own shift away from its
traditional liberal moorings.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the most knowledgeable people I've ever known in
state government," said John Plaxco, a former aide. "He knows how to
get things done in a way few people do."</TE>
<TE>   If he wins reelection Nov. 5, Davis will arguably be the most
successful Democratic politician California has ever seen, winning
three separate offices in five elections--all, so far, by big
margins.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, for all that, Davis' voracious fund-raising, his clinical
approach to issues and his constant eye on the next opportunity have
created a widely held perception, in the words of one past advisor,
that for him principle always falls second to political calculation.</TE>
<TE>   "What motivates him is to win," said Richard Steffen, who served
as Davis' chief of staff during his two terms in the state Assembly.
"To get elected."</TE>
<TE>   Those who have worked closely with Davis at different times over
the past two decades use identical words to describe him. He is a
shark, a machine, the Stepford politician, a man who, for all his
accomplishments, still rubs many Californians--and even many of his
own aides--the wrong way. It was his "agenda" to become governor,
former staff members say, not his dream.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the criticism is said privately, a testament to the
governor's power and to fears of retribution. Working for Davis has
been a rite of passage for a generation of California Democrats, many
still active in state government and politics. Almost unanimously,
they share the perception of Davis as someone more interested in
self-advancement than substantive achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "When we sat down to talk about his goals for the year, it was
never how to make the world a better place," said one former aide.
"It was always, 'What's going to get me media attention?' and 'What's
going to please interest groups?' " important to Davis' fund-raising.
"That was the heart of discussions."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has long disputed the notion that he cares more about
politicking than policymaking. "I enjoy governing," he said in a
campaign-trail interview four years ago, describing the
fund-raising-and-chicken-dinner grind as a necessary burden.
(Privately, aides go further, saying he detests the glad-handing and
political pomp that other candidates find exhilarating.)</TE>
<TE>   As for the ego salve of personal adulation, Davis said in Monday's
debate, "My job is not to win a popularity contest. It's to lead this
state."</TE>
<TE>   Despite several accusations of impropriety over the years, Davis
has denied ever using his office for personal gain and vehemently
rejects any connection between the money he raises and his official
actions. "I make decisions based on what I think the merits are, and
I'll continue to do that," Davis said last month as he signed the
state budget into law.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Davis grew up in a Republican household
amid relative affluence until his alcoholic father squandered the
family's wealth. To help pay for college, Davis joined the ROTC and
eventually spent two years in the Army, serving for almost seven
months in the Signal Corps in Vietnam. The experience politicized
him, Davis later said, when he saw much of the fighting being done
"by people of color and whites who didn't have college degrees."</TE>
<TE>   That consciousness of prejudice and privilege has been a constant
through Davis' public life. Steffen remembers his boss citing his
elite education at Stanford and Columbia universities and his pledge
to work so others had the same doors opened. "His rhetoric today
about improving schools is consistent with what he'd said back then,"
according to Steffen.</TE>
<TE>   Gay activist David Mixner recalls Davis' willingness to meet with
gay groups during the Brown years, back when it was rare--and
risky--for a politician to even utter words like "gay" and "lesbian"
in public.</TE>
<TE>   "He was extremely receptive, always returned our calls, and any
meeting we requested we immediately got," said Mixner, who later
backed Davis in assorted races. campaigns. "Jerry Brown was the
pioneer, and Gray Davis was the one who pushed him very hard on
that."</TE>
<TE>   But even then, Davis showed the pragmatism--timidity, critics call
it--that has come to be his political trademark. "If he thought
something could get done, he would make the effort," Mixner said. "If
he thought it wasn't doable, he wouldn't waste his time. He'd be very
direct: 'It's not going to happen this session, but here's what we
can do.' "</TE>
<TE>   The caution that Davis showed then and now goes to the question of
political leadership and, like the problem of the chicken and the
egg, poses a riddle with no obvious answer. Is it the role of an
elected official to summon people to move in a direction the
politician sees fit? Or should leaders implement the people's will,
bowing to the sentiment that helped elect them in the first place?</TE>
<TE>   To the governor's critics, his baby-step approach is a failing
that speaks to a single-minded devotion: to himself and his career
advancement. "He never took a risk," said a former political aide,
one of several who cited Davis' legislation to put missing kids'
faces on milk cartons as just the kind of inoffensive,
publicity-grabbing initiative he sought out. "Everything he did was
safe. After a while you begin to think maybe it's just about getting
ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Defenders say that shallow portrait of Davis is facile but misses
a larger picture. "People don't see him trying to solve a problem or
grapple with an issue or figure out how to get from here to there on
a policy question," said Stephen Rivers, an entertainment industry
consultant and former Davis campaign aide who remains active in
Democratic politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Those kind of efforts aren't played out in public, and he's not a
charismatic sort of figure you see pounding the podium because he
believes in this or that issue. So the superficial image focusing on
fund-raising is what people focus on."</TE>
<TE>   Money has long been integral to the success--and occasional
missteps--of Davis, who got his start in politics more than 30 years
ago as a fund-raiser for Los Angeles mayoral candidate Tom Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   After helping elect Bradley in 1973, Davis made his own run for
public office, a failed bid for state treasurer. (Davis assailed the
front-runner, Jesse Unruh, for prodigious fund-raising, at one point
likening Unruh to a prostitute.)</TE>
<TE>   After Unruh won the June 1974 primary, gubernatorial hopeful Brown
tapped Davis as a fund-raiser for the fall campaign. After he was
elected, Brown made the 32-year-old Davis his chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear to all of us that ... was not Gray's last
stop," said Bill Press, who worked under Davis as Brown's director of
planning and research. "He was politically driven ... and it was
clear that he saw himself someday sitting in the governor's office."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Davis demands utter obedience--and preferably
anonymity--from his staff, going so far as to personally edit every
press release issued by his administration and its myriad department
heads. But as Brown's top aide he could not have been more different.</TE>
<TE>   He became a fixture on TV and radio, sometimes elbowing the
governor aside, to make sure everyone knew it was his idea--not
Brown's--to plant the governor in a modest Plymouth as a symbol of
government austerity.</TE>
<TE>   Scrupulous about his image, Davis became known for calling
Sacramento correspondents, sometimes repeatedly in one day, to edit
and reedit his quotes, including the proper use of punctuation; once
he berated a reporter who left him unmentioned in a story by
scolding, "My name is not spelled a-i-d-e."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' name even showed up on Brown's reelection bumper stickers,
though he later said they just happened to come back that way from
the printer.</TE>
<TE>   On a few occasions, however, he was frank about his aspirations,
something most politicians try to hide. "I like to say everyone in
the district is upwardly mobile, including their representative," he
told an interviewer after just one term in the Assembly, representing
Beverly Hills and the Westside. Another time he acknowledged, "You
don't run for state office without some ambition or a healthy ego."</TE>
<TE>   In that first Assembly contest 20 years ago Davis established a
pattern that would serve him well throughout his career, raising
hundreds of thousands of dollars to scare off a field of Democratic
rivals. The tactic worked again four years later, in 1986, when he
made his second try at statewide office.</TE>
<TE>   He was sitting on $1 million in donations when state Controller
Ken Cory announced his retirement just days before the candidate
filing deadline. Thanks to his financial head start--and a bankroll
that later swelled to a formidable $5 million--Davis handily won the
Democratic primary and cruised to election in November.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next eight years, Davis amply demonstrated his political
skills and promotional savvy. The main duties of the controller are
paying the state's bills and keeping track of its books. But Davis
turned the job into a soapbox for causes only peripherally related to
his responsibilities, like coastal protection and abortion rights; he
was a regular on the barricades outside family planning clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also came under criticism twice for allegedly mingling
politics and policy. In the first case, he narrowly averted
prosecution by reimbursing the state $28,000 for improperly using
Assembly staffers and office equipment during his 1986 controller's
campaign. In the second, Davis was embarrassed by reports that he had
named political cronies, personal friends and relatives of campaign
contributors to highly paid jobs as state probate referees.</TE>
<TE>   Davis denied any wrongdoing, but the charge of mixing fund-raising
and favors would continue to haunt him as governor. At $100 million
and counting, Davis has probably raised and spent more money than any
politician in California history. But he lives modestly--home is a
1,000-square-foot condominium in West Hollywood--which underscores
what Davis intimates say: money matters only to the extent it fuels
his political ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't campaign cash that cost Davis dearly the one time he
strayed from his carefully plotted career path. Facing a reshuffled
landscape resulting from term limits and campaign finance changes, he
plunged into the ill-fated 1992 race for the U.S. Senate. The low
point came in a single, desperate advertisement run near the close of
the campaign. The TV spot, likening rival Dianne Feinstein to Leona
Helmsley, the New York City hotelier and convicted tax cheat,
infuriated women and many of Davis' Jewish supporters. It took
years--and repeated apologies--to live down.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, while Davis has opened himself to charges of opportunism,
his record shows a pattern of ideological consistency.</TE>
<TE>   As far back as the Brown administration Davis spoke of slashing
regulations and creating a more business-friendly environment, a
theme he took up 20 years later in his inaugural address as
lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   He supported the death penalty--even when most elected Democrats
did not--and broke with many in his party by endorsing a
constitutional ban on flag burning and national welfare reform
legislation. Somewhere between the New Deal and the new millennium,
Democrats got "off the track [and] people expected to be paid because
they're in a certain category," Davis said in a 1995 interview. He
urged his party "to honor work, reward people who work, speak to
people who work."</TE>
<TE>   It was that pitch-perfect tone that helped Davis withstand the
Republican wave that swept through California in November 1994. Davis
not only hung on to win the lieutenant governor's office, but also
managed to pull more votes--over 4 million--than any other Democrat
in America.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who lost that day was Kathleen Brown, California's
Democratic nominee for governor and Jerry Brown's younger sister.
Davis had been prepared to serve another eight years as a Brown
understudy before taking his own shot at the governor's chair,
advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   But with her loss--and term limits forcing incumbent Republican
Pete Wilson from office--Davis' timetable was moved up.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he was ready with a slogan tweaking his millionaire
primary opponents--businessman Al Checchi and South Bay Rep. Jane
Harman--and, felicitously, turning his own job-hopping into a virtue:
"Experience money can't buy."</TE>
<TE>   On election night Davis romped to the Democratic nomination, an
intermediate stop on the way to a November landslide over Republican
Dan Lungren. As he savored his primary win, the man who had built his
success on a foundation of tactical maneuvers and stacks of campaign
cash found a moment that transcended any price tag.</TE>
<TE>   "My friends," Davis told supporters in a glitzy Los Angeles
ballroom, "this is truly an experience which money can't buy."</TE>

<LD>Getting fitted Thursday for a teen fashion show, Katie Sereno knew
what she didn't want in a formal dress. Nothing slinky. Nothing
slitted, backless or plunging. And, please, nothing
bellybutton-baring.</LD>
<LD>   In a teen fashion world ruled by the likes of Britney Spears, this
eliminates just about any off-the-rack gown.</LD>
<LD>   The Anaheim High School senior, like many of the 520,000 Mormon
teenage girls across the country, usually would have to improvise:
She would borrow a popular dress from a fellow church member or make
something from scratch. For a recent school dance, a friend added
sleeves to a store-bought dress using decorative ribbons of fabric
cut from the back of the garment.</LD>
<TE>   Now, thanks to the unlikely collaboration of two
fashion-frustrated Mormon moms and Nordstrom, she has
alternatives--more than 30 of them. On Saturday, Nordstrom in Costa
Mesa's South Coast Plaza will host a sold-out fashion show featuring
33 Mormon teenage girls from Southern California wearing stylish
dresses with not a spaghetti strap in sight.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a gold mine for us," said Sereno, who will model in the
show and hopes to buy a gown for her homecoming dance this month.
"You can actually pick out a dress you like instead of just settling
for something."</TE>
<TE>   In a hint of the pent-up demand and a potential market niche for
retailers, 900 free tickets were snapped up shortly after the show
was announced, and more than 250 people are on the waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers have had to turn away other fashion-conservative
teens--including Roman Catholics, Jews, Protestants and
Muslims--whose religion dictates modesty.</TE>
<TE>   "All are thrilled with the idea," said Karen Baker, a Mormon
mother from Rancho Santa Margarita who initially contacted Nordstrom
about the show. "It's snowballed almost out of control."</TE>
<TE>   Fashion experts say Mormons aren't the only families tired of
having only provocative choices when shopping for dressy girls'
clothes. This miniature cultural counterrevolution could lead
retailers to recognize that there's a market for clothes that lean to
the conservative side, not just in fancy dresses but in active-wear
for teens as well.</TE>
<TE>   "As a grandparent and viewer of society, I wish the entire culture
had demanded that of the apparel industry over the past couple of
years," said Ilse Metchek, executive director of the California
Fashion Assn., a Los Angeles-based group that serves as an industry
voice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gotten away from us, but in these particular [religious]
cultures, it hasn't gotten away from them," Metchek said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, with the help of a second Mormon mom, Carol Starr, took up
the cause in May after her 17-year-old daughter, Jana, couldn't find
a dress for a formal dance that didn't look, in Jana's words, like
"something a grandmother would wear."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother had heard about a small "modesty" fashion show at
Nordstrom's Montclair store in March for Mormon teens searching for
prom dresses, an event that attracted about 300 people. So she
approached Kim Cimino, manager of the South Coast Plaza store, with
the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her this was the responsible thing to do," Baker said.
"We've got to give teens a different message. Kim was really
wonderful about it."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the high profiles of Nordstrom and South Coast Plaza,
Cimino says she gets hundreds of requests each year to hold fashion
shows at her store. But Baker's proposal was an excellent match
because the company could, with some effort, provide the teens with
dress styles they wanted through increased orders from certain
vendors and by bringing aboard two new designers.</TE>
<TE>   "It really wasn't that tough to say, 'Yes,' " said Cimino, adding
that for any teen, finding the right formal dress is never easy.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not quite an adult women, but you don't want to look like
a little girl."</TE>
<TE>   Nordstrom was able to come up with eight formal dress styles, and
Mormon families helped by enlisting two other designers. One, whose
Utah business started with modest wedding gowns, produced 23 styles
and 200 dresses. The other, from Orange County, custom-made two
gowns.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I didn't want any part of it at the start," said
Jeri Lee, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
from Trabuco Canyon who was busy with her line of Jerdog tennis
clothes. "But I decided it was an important thing to do. I have three
boys, and I'm so uncomfortable with what teenage girls are wearing."</TE>
<TE>   Lee said the real test will be whether the dresses are purchased
after the fashion show.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as there are orders for them," she said, "we'll go ahead
and expand the line to prom dresses."</TE>
<TE>   The demand for tickets has organizers hopeful. Even teens who
couldn't buy tickets plan to arrive at Nordstrom at 10 a.m. Saturday,
just after the fashion show, when the collection opens to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't surprised" at the crowd, Cimino said. "When something's
really difficult to find and you can [suddenly] find it, you get that
kind of response."</TE>
<TE>   Darlene Bergeson, a high school junior, will travel from Lake
Arrowhead to model in the show and, with any luck, buy a dress. "So
many of my friends want tickets," Bergeson said. "They've been
waiting for this day."</TE>
<TE>   Many Mormon teens say their fight over what to wear is with the
fashion industry, not their parents or faith. "Guys that are
attracted to [revealing] clothes I don't want," said Anna Gordon, a
senior at Huntington Beach High School. "Instead of being noticed for
my skin, I want to be noticed for who I am."</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's fitting, Jillian Green, 17, beamed as she modeled a
pink tulle dress with sequins and beading.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so puffy," said the senior at Sonora High School in
Fullerton. "I feel like a princess."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike cutting-edge stores that cater to teens, Nordstrom, one of
the country's leading retailers, is known for its huge variety of
fashion--from designer classics to trendy clothes. And the
Seattle-based chain allows employees the freedom to satisfy
individual customers, which resulted in small "modesty" fashion shows
for teens last year in Kansas and in Montclair.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials said that if Saturday's fashion show generates
in enough sales, additional conservative fashions for teens will be
considered for their stores.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the momentum going after the show, leaders of the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints plan a public relations campaign
to reach U.S. Mormons, other faith groups and anyone else interested
in modest teen clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be there in a second," said Sabiha Khan, 24, a Muslim woman
who works at the Southern California chapter of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations. "A lot of Muslims, especially teenagers,
would love it. All teenagers like to look good."</TE>
<TE>   Muslim teens have had to adopt many of the same strategies as
Mormons. They sew up slits on long dresses. They take fabric from
shawls or decorative pieces of the dress to craft sleeves. And
they've established an informal fashion grapevine to alert friends to
rare finds of stylish but modest clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Khan said Muslim fashion shows held at mosques and community
centers often attract 200 interested shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   The lobbying for a better selection of modest clothing can have
results, in much the same way the market for plus-size fashion has
developed. Retailers sometimes overlook markets that "are right there
in front of you," said Barbara Fields, a Los Angeles-based consultant
to large retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder if this could be the start of something bigger.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the whole feminine, softer look could become a style as the
antithesis of the whole Britney Spears trend," said Metchek of the
California Fashion Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "The pendulum has to start swinging the other way," agreed Baker.
"I just don't think you can bare any more."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senior Bush administration officials are pressuring CIA analysts to
tailor their assessments of the Iraqi threat to help build a case
against Saddam Hussein, intelligence and congressional sources said.</LD>
<LD>   In what sources described as an escalating "war," top officials at
the Pentagon and elsewhere have bombarded CIA analysts with criticism
and calls for revisions on such key questions as whether Iraq has
ties to the Al Qaeda terrorist network, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The sources stressed that CIA analysts--who are supposed to be
impartial--are fighting to resist the pressure. But they said
analysts are increasingly resentful of what they perceive as efforts
to contaminate the intelligence process.</LD>
<TE>   "Analysts feel more politicized and more pushed than many of them
can ever remember," said an intelligence official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys at the Pentagon shriek on issues such as the link
between Iraq and Al Qaeda. There has been a lot of pressure to write
on this constantly, and to not let it drop."</TE>
<TE>   The pressure has intensified in the weeks leading up to this
week's debate in Congress on a resolution granting President Bush
permission to pursue a military invasion of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of the differences between the agency and the White House
surfaced publicly this week when CIA Director George J. Tenet sent a
letter to lawmakers saying the Iraqi president is unlikely to strike
the United States unless provoked.</TE>
<TE>   That was at odds with statements from Bush and others that Iraq
poses an immediate threat. In a speech Monday in Cincinnati, Bush
said the danger that Iraq poses to the United States "is already
significant, and it only grows worse with time."</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers voiced frustration with the way intelligence is
being used in the debate on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned about the politicization of intelligence," said
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who echoed complaints of other
members that the administration has been selective in the
intelligence it cites, overstating its case in many instances.</TE>
<TE>   Classified material provided recently by the CIA on Iraq's
capabilities and intentions "does not track some of the public
statements made by senior administration officials," Feinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside experts say they too see growing cause for concern.</TE>
<TE>   "The intelligence officials are responding to the political
leadership, not the other way around, which is how it should be,"
said Joseph Cirincione, a nonproliferation expert at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. "The politics are driving our
intelligence assessments at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet rejected assertions that the agency is being unduly
influenced.</TE>
<TE>   "The president of the United States would never tolerate anything
other than our most honest judgment," Tenet said in a statement late
Thursday. "Our credibility and integrity are our most precious
commodities. We will not let anyone tell us what conclusions to
reach.</TE>
<TE>   "Policymakers, members of Congress and others are free to push us
to challenge our assertions and to ask tough, probing questions. This
is healthy. But the notion that we would shape our assessments to
please any one of our customers is abhorrent to the ethic by which we
work and is simply untrue."</TE>
<TE>   Unrelenting Pressure</TE>
<TE>   But intelligence sources say the pressure on CIA analysts has been
unrelenting in recent months, much of it coming from Iraq hawks
including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his top deputy,
Paul D. Wolfowitz.</TE>
<TE>   CIA officials who brief Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz on Iraq routinely
return to the agency with a long list of complaints and demands for
new analysis or shifts in emphasis, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of unhappiness with the analysis," usually because
it is seen as not hard-line enough, one intelligence official said.</TE>
<TE>   Another government official said CIA briefers "are constantly sent
back by the senior people at Defense and other places to get more,
get more, get more to make their case."</TE>
<TE>   A senior Pentagon official rejected claims that Rumsfeld would
improperly influence intelligence analysts and said they might be
misinterpreting remarks meant to test their convictions. "He's a guy
who's constantly challenging assertions and assumptions," the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   But White House hawks have shown a tendency for stretching the
case against Iraq. Wolfowitz and others have clung to claims that
Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta met with an Iraqi agent in Prague, the
Czech capital, last year even though the CIA has viewed the report
with deep skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's recent remark that the United States has "bulletproof"
evidence of links between Al Qaeda and Hussein struck many in the
intelligence community as an exaggerated assessment of the available
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Tenet's letter to lawmakers this week said the agency's
"understanding of the relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda is
evolving and is based on sources of varying reliability."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Bush said in his Cincinnati speech, "We've learned that
Iraq has trained Al Qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and
deadly gases."</TE>
<TE>   But Tenet's letter was more equivocal, saying only that there has
been "reporting" that such training has taken place. Unlike other
passages of the letter, he did not describe the reporting as "solid"
or "credible."</TE>
<TE>   The sequence of events surrounding the release of the letter is
seen by many on Capitol Hill as an example of how the political winds
have whipped intelligence on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet released the letter only after being pushed to do so by
lawmakers unhappy with an earlier CIA report on Iraq that hewed
closely to the White House line.</TE>
<TE>   When lawmakers seized on the letter in speeches against the White
House case for war, Tenet quickly issued another statement asserting
that "there is no inconsistency" between White House and agency views
on Iraq danger. A day later, Tenet rejected another request from
lawmakers to declassify additional material on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet "is in a bad position," said one congressional aide. "He's
under fire from the [intelligence] committees. Then he's under fire
from the White House."</TE>
<TE>   Some agency critics note that the CIA's public statements on Iraq
have evolved over the last year, escalating their assessment of the
risk posed by Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   When Tenet testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on
March 19, for example, the Iraqi threat was not singled out or
described with particular urgency.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein "may ... have retained the capability to deliver"
biological or chemical weapons "using modified aircraft or other
unmanned aerial vehicles," Tenet said, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also told the committee at the time that Baghdad has "had
contacts" with Al Qaeda and that tactical cooperation is "possible."
His letter to lawmakers this week asserts "senior level contacts"
going back a decade.</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. intelligence official said some of the changes can
be attributed to new information gained from interrogations of
several Al Qaeda leaders captured in Pakistan and elsewhere since
spring.</TE>
<TE>   The official insisted that intelligence also supported Bush's
widely challenged charge that Iraq is "exploring ways" of using drone
aircraft to disperse chemical or biological agents against targets in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. reports confirm that Iraq has converted Czech-made L-29
trainer jets into unmanned aircraft and that it has sought to equip
them with sprayers, but such planes are incapable of flying long
distances.</TE>
<TE>   During his speech Tuesday on Iraq, Bush repeated a claim that
Baghdad has attempted to import high-strength aluminum tubes "for gas
centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons."</TE>
<TE>   The claim, however, is widely disputed. A British government
report last month, which reflects the judgments of British
intelligence, notes that "no definitive intelligence" links the tubes
to a nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   Old Accusations</TE>
<TE>   Accusations that the CIA has shaded its analysis of sensitive
national security issues to support administration policies are not
new.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Reagan and other Republicans charged that the CIA under
President Carter underestimated the Soviet threat in the late 1970s,
leading to creation of a separate "Blue Team" panel that produced a
more dire analysis of the data.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton administration, hawkish Republicans charged
that the intelligence community was downplaying the threat of
ballistic missiles.</TE>
<TE>   A commission led by Rumsfeld argued that the threat was much more
immediate and thus sharpened the political debate over national
missile defense.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Bridge Collapse Kills 1, Injures 10</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MARCY, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>A pedestrian bridge under construction collapsed Thursday as concrete
was being poured onto its steel girders, killing one worker and
injuring 10 others, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the injured were in critical condition.</LD>
<LD>   The workers were standing on the bridge when the girders crashed
onto an unfinished highway 20 feet below, said Paul Obernesser,
regional construction engineer for the state Transportation
Department.</LD>
<TE>   It took dozens of emergency workers about 45 minutes to free
everyone from the debris.</TE>
<TE>   The steel skeleton had been put in place over the summer and had
passed safety inspections, Obernesser said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to find out exactly what happened," said Alice
Romanych, an assistant to the regional director of the Transportation
Department. "We want to make sure it never happens again."</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Highway Administration and U.S. Occupational Safety
and Health Administration sent inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   One of the injured was a Transportation Department employee. The
rest, including the man who died, 46-year-old Scott Couchman, worked
for the contractor, Tioga Construction, company officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally a deck pour is stressful in certain respects, but not
from the standpoint of a bridge suddenly collapsing," said Charles
Sirowatka, a project engineer with the company.</TE>
<TE>   The 170-foot-long, 12-foot-wide pedestrian bridge was being built
over a new section of the Utica-Rome Expressway, a project that
started in the late 1970s to link the two cities with a four-lane
highway.</TE>
<TE>   The $165-million project is expected to be completed in 2004. The
pedestrian bridge was supposed to be finished this month.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Colorado appeals court in Denver upheld the nation's first
conviction of a skier for killing another person in a collision on
the slopes.</LD>
<LD>   Nathan Hall was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide two
years ago in the 1997 death of Alan Cobb, a 33-year-old carpenter who
died of head injuries after Hall plowed into him while skiing fast in
Vail.</LD>
<LD>   Hall was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years' probation
and was ordered to pay $18,000 to Cobb's family.</LD>
<TE>   Hall, 23, argued that the jury should have been able to consider
the less-serious charge of reckless endangerment. But the Court of
Appeals ruled that he was not entitled to the lesser charge because
he admitted his conduct resulted in death.</TE>

<LD>GOP gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney downplayed a report that he
benefited from the sale of a medical company that later admitted it
had profited from Medicare fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The Boston Globe reported that Romney made $473,000 from the 1993
sale to Corning Inc. of Damon Clinical Laboratories, whose profits
were generated in part by fraudulently billing Medicare for unneeded
blood tests. Romney's firm, Bain Capital Inc., tripled its investment
in the company and made $7.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   However, Romney said he helped uncover the fraud at Damon and
hired an outside law firm to investigate it.</LD>

<HD>Truck, School Bus Crash Hurts Dozens</HD>
<DH>Accident: Eight are critically injured. The impact sends
some children onto pavement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ERIE TOWNSHIP, Mich.</DL>
<LD>A truck hauling steel coils crashed into the side of a school bus
taking youngsters on a field trip Thursday, injuring more than three
dozen children and adults, eight critically.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just bodies all over the place," firefighter Cliff Moore
said.</LD>
<LD>   The impact sent the bus, carrying kindergartners and first- and
second-graders, spinning across the road and threw at least five
children onto the pavement and into a yard.</LD>
<TE>   "When I got to it, the kids were screaming," said Pat Labelle, who
was driving behind the bus. "They were screaming like there was no
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   He said he took a first-aid kit from his car, ran to the bus and
crawled in through the back door, pulling children out because he
feared a fire would erupt.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals treated at least 48 people. All eight of those in
critical condition are children, and four children and three
adults--including a 67-year-old woman--were in serious condition. The
bus was carrying 43 children and 17 adults.</TE>
<TE>   The bus, operated by Trinity Bus Co., was one of three in a
caravan from Pierre Toussaint Academy, a charter school in Detroit.
The first two buses crossed an intersection safely, but the truck
collided with the third, tearing a hole in its side, sheriff's Maj.
Tom Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   The truck, which was carrying 38 tons of steel, appeared to have
pushed the bus about 100 feet, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't appear the steel hauler was at fault," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   The bus driver entered the intersection and failed to yield to
oncoming traffic, the sheriff's department said later Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The truck driver was treated at a hospital and released. The bus
driver was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Aerial photos showed the front of the truck embedded in the bus. A
boy clutching a teddy bear was carried off on a stretcher.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Sheppard, president of Trinity, said the company had just
hired the bus driver on Monday, but he had driven for another company
and had an "impeccable" driving record.</TE>
<TE>   After the crash, parents and siblings waited for news at the
school, which has 460 pupils in kindergarten through eighth grade.</TE>
<TE>   Seventh-grader Tierra Wheeler said she did not know whether her
4-year-old sister was hurt but was hoping to see her get off the bus
with the other returning children.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go up to her and give her a great big hug," Tierra said.</TE>

<HD>GOP Lawmakers Stall Bill on Independent 9/11 Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Terror: House member says investigation's scope is still
unresolved. Some question whether White House is behind last-minute
opposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Legislation to create an independent commission to investigate
government failures leading up to last year's terrorist attacks
snagged Thursday, jeopardizing a measure that relatives of those
killed have lobbied for extensively.</LD>
<LD>   Just hours after lawmakers held a news conference announcing that
they had reached agreement on the commission, the deal ran into
unexpected opposition from House Republicans, led by Rep. Porter J.
Goss of Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Goss, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said late
Thursday that legislators had yet to resolve whether the commission
would have the authority to examine all branches of government,
including Congress.</LD>
<TE>   Goss said he favors giving the commission a broad mandate and that
he believed the issue could be resolved quickly. "Essentially, what
we need is a little more time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But several congressional sources said Goss never raised the issue
of scope when lawmakers were ironing out their agreement in meetings
Thursday. One Senate aide said the language of the bill already
allows for the panel to probe all branches of government.</TE>
<TE>   Some wondered whether Goss, who has close ties to the White House,
came under last-minute administration pressure to delay it. Goss
dismissed that suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   The White House endorsed the commission recently after opposing it
for much of the year, but it has raised concerns about the panel's
scope and structure.</TE>
<TE>   Under the initial agreement reached Thursday, the panel would have
10 members, run by two co-chairs--one appointed by the White House
and another appointed by Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).
The White House had sought to have a single chairman that it would
appoint.</TE>
<TE>   The panel would also have two years to operate, which is twice as
long as the White House wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), a proponent of the commission,
said through a spokesman that he was "surprised and disappointed"
when he heard that the deal had stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the panel remained hopeful that it could still be
approved, but time is running out on the congressional session.</TE>
<TE>   Before the deal unraveled, Scott McClellan, deputy press secretary
at the White House, said the administration was "pleased" with the
initial deal. But he added that White House officials wanted to study
the details before signing on.</TE>
<TE>   The commission would examine such issues as U.S. intelligence
gathering, commercial aviation, immigration and the flow of assets to
terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The White House initially opposed the creation of a commission,
saying that it would duplicate congressional inquiries and that it
could distract intelligence officials working to prevent future
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But President Bush relented after emotional appeals by relatives
of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, White House aides in discussions with lawmakers and their
staff in recent weeks continued to oppose certain
provisions--demanding, for instance, that a majority vote by the
commission be required to issue subpoenas. The agreement unveiled
Thursday would allow subpoenas with just five votes.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate in late September overwhelmingly passed a bill to
create the commission. The House favored a panel with a narrower
focus, thus requiring a conference committee to resolve the
differences. It was those talks that snagged late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations on the commission came as the two congressional
intelligence committees are winding down their own inquiries into the
terrorist attacks.</TE>

<HD>Congress Backs War on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Bipartisan Vote Gives Bush Broad Power; President Lauds
Clear Message Sent</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A measure to authorize the use of military force against Iraq won
final congressional approval early today, giving President Bush a
strong bipartisan mandate and broad power to challenge an adversary
who has bedeviled the United States for more than a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Ending a somber debate that pushed past midnight, the Senate
voted, 77 to 23, for the resolution. The action came hours after the
House gave its approval on a 296-133 vote.</LD>
<LD>   The votes gave Bush a decisive victory as he attempts to build
international support for a concerted effort to disarm Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein of his regime's suspected weapons of mass
destruction. It was the second time in his presidency that Bush has
won congressional authorization to use force, a development that
could lead to a major new phase of military action for a nation
already at war against terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement after the House vote, Bush said:</TE>
<TE>   "The House of Representatives has spoken clearly to the world and
to the United Nations Security Council," Bush said. "The gathering
threat of Iraq must be confronted fully and finally."</TE>
<TE>   If diplomacy fails, the congressional resolution clears the way
for Bush to launch a military strike in one of the most volatile
regions of the world. The measure is a foreign policy milestone that
could mark the beginning of a long, potentially costly U.S.
commitment in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, many lawmakers expressed the hope that the
resolution will make it less likely that force will actually need to
be used.</TE>
<TE>   "I strongly believe that our diplomacy will achieve its purpose
only if the Iraqi regime knows that a sword of Damocles hangs over
its head," said Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents warned that, by allowing Bush to launch a unilateral
first strike if he chooses, the resolution represents a troubling
shift away from long-standing U.S. strategy of eschewing preemptive
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution gives Bush the power to use any means he determines
necessary and appropriate--including military force--to respond to
the perceived threat posed by Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has said repeatedly that he has not decided whether to resort
to war. If he does, the resolution requires Bush to certify to
Congress, within 48 hours after the launch of a military strike, that
diplomatic avenues had proved fruitless and that an attack was
"consistent" with ongoing efforts to fight terrorism. In the Senate,
key lawmakers who voted for the resolution included Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Sen. Barbara
Boxer (D-Calif.) voted against the measure.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate debate stretched deep into the night as senators rose,
one after another, to go on the record in one of the most significant
votes of the last dozen years. Shortly before midnight, for instance,
Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) declared that the time had come to face
down Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer we wait, the stronger he becomes and the harder he
will be to defeat," Ensign said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, blasted the resolution as "too timid," arguing that
Congress should have broadened the resolution to give Bush even
greater authority to attack international terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In the final Senate roll call, 29 Democrats joined 48 Republicans
in backing Bush. Twenty-one Democrats, Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.)
and independent Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont were opposed.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier vote that signaled a big Bush victory, the Senate
early Thursday voted, 75 to 25, to end delaying tactics and bring
debate to a close. That was a defeat for impassioned critics of
Bush's Iraqi policy, who complained that Congress was being buffaloed
into authorizing war even before the White House has decided to
prosecute one.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in my 50th year in Congress and I never thought I would find
a Senate which lacks the backbone to stand up against this stampede,
this rush to war," said Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.). "I think we
are making one horrible mistake."</TE>
<TE>   GOP Skeptics</TE>
<TE>   Just a month ago, as Bush pressed his case for confronting Iraq,
he had faced a phalanx of such skeptics, who included members of his
own party. Although he made some concessions to congressional
concerns, the final resolution gave him most of the broad powers he
sought. In the House vote, only six Republicans voted against him.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's ability to sway Democrats proved more limited--81 of the
party's House members supported the resolution, with 126 opposing it.
Also voting against the measure was independent Rep. Bernard Sanders
of Vermont.</TE>
<TE>   It was a stronger showing of opposition than expected by anti-war
Democrats, who had predicted about 100 votes for their side.</TE>
<TE>   "This represents a great accomplishment for the Americans who have
expressed their concern with this rush to war," said Rep. Lloyd
Doggett (D-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills), a leading Bush ally
on the Iraq issue, said the overall House vote was lopsided enough to
send a message of strong U.S. resolve behind Bush's policy.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives him the tools to go to the U.N. and produce a very
strong inspection resolution," said Berman.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has been trying to build support for a U.N.
resolution that would establish a strict new regimen of weapons
inspection inside Iraq, and threaten "consequences" if Hussein
refuses to comply.</TE>
<TE>   The House vote also amounted to a more resounding show of support
than Bush's father received in 1991, when a Democratic-controlled
House authorized the Persian Gulf War, 250 to 183.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate vote was far more decisive than the 52-47 vote for the
1991 resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The House vote climaxed three days of debate that, while lacking
the drama of uncertainty about the outcome, was rife with sober
expressions of the gravity of the matter facing Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "Many watch what we say and do here," Rep. Lindsey O. Graham
(R-S.C.) said Thursday. "We'll either be stronger or we'll be weaker
in our ability to negotiate and to make the world safer.... Our
enemies are watching."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers briefly heard from anti-war forces in the public when,
as the House was winding up debate, two protesters in the gallery
disrupted the proceedings with shouts of, "No war," and, "Blood for
oil."</TE>
<TE>   Both the House and Senate on Thursday soundly defeated efforts to
revise the resolution to put more emphasis on diplomacy and on
working through the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, the most serious challenge to Bush came from an
alternative offered by Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (D-S.C.), which would
have authorized military force only in conjunction with passage of a
U.N. Security Council resolution backing such a strike. Bush would
have had to come back to Congress if the U.N. failed to act.</TE>
<TE>   That amendment was rejected, 270 to 155.</TE>
<TE>   The House also rejected, 355 to 72, an alternative proposed by
Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland) that urged the United States to work for
Iraqi disarmament through peaceful means, such as U.N. diplomatic
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   In opposing the alternatives, Bush's allies argued that Iraq has
failed to comply with more than a dozen U.N. resolutions that have
passed over the last decade. They said there is little reason to
think another effort would be any more successful.</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.N. was going to act, they would have done it already,"
said Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.). "The time to act is now, not waiting
on the U.N."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Bush's policy warned that an attack on Iraq would
undermine the ongoing effort to root out terrorism around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "The clear and present danger our country faces is terrorism,"
said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). "Our work is not done."</TE>
<TE>   But hawks said confronting Hussein is part and parcel of the war
on terrorists, warning that he might arm them with weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "A nuclear-armed Iraq would soon become the world's largest safe
haven and refuge for the world's terrorist organizations," said House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, the weeklong debate on the resolution entered its
home stretch early Thursday when Daschle embraced the measure. He had
been the only top congressional leader who did not embrace it last
week after Bush agreed to various changes, such as limiting its scope
to Iraq instead of the entire region.</TE>
<TE>   Abandoning efforts to make the measure even more to his liking,
Daschle took to the Senate floor to praise Bush for making the
resolution "more in keeping with our strong belief that force must be
a last resort, not a first response."</TE>
<TE>   Nonpartisan View</TE>
<TE>   "It is neither a Democratic resolution nor a Republican
resolution," said Daschle. "Because I believe it is important for
America to speak with one voice at this critical moment, I will vote
to give the president the authority he needs."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein said she would support the Bush resolution despite
reservations that it would allow the United States to launch a
unilateral, preemptive attack. She said she would vote for it "with
the trust that the administration will forge a coalition, rather than
go it alone."</TE>
<TE>   Another fence sitter who fell into Bush's camp was Sen. Susan
Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican who said she concluded that
supporting the resolution was the best way to prompt strong U.N.
action.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate defeated, 75 to 24, a proposal by Sen. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.) that--like Spratt's in the House--would have linked
authorization of use of force to action by the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   Levin portrayed his approach as the best hope to build a global
coalition against Hussein without damaging the U.S.-led campaign
against terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment was backed by only one Republican, Chafee of Rhode
Island, and failed to draw a majority of Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Joseph R. Biden
Jr. (D-Del.) dropped plans to offer an alternative that would have
narrowed the authorization for use of force solely to the aim of
disarming Iraq, not toppling Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Biden said he agreed to back Bush to step up pressure on the U.N.
and because the president had assured him that the focus of U.S.
policy would be disarmament, not regime change.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about weapons of mass destruction," Biden said. "If the
president attempts to take this nation to war ... for any reason--any
reason--other than weapons of mass destruction, I will be on this
floor every day taking issue."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Firefighters Get Cold Shoulder on Wage Demands</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Heroes of Sept. 11 attacks square off against the
mayor over a contract. They want generous raises in times of fiscal
constraint.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>They have been hailed as national heroes and honored as "New York's
bravest." City leaders can't say enough about their firefighters, but
giving them the hefty wage increase they want is another matter.</LD>
<LD>   In a dispute that has become highly embarrassing to the Big Apple,
New York firefighters on Thursday rejected the city's latest wage
offer, calling it inadequate. Tensions are likely to increase today,
when thousands of them plan to hold a rally in Central Park, and then
pack Madison Square Garden on Saturday for a special service honoring
the 343 firefighters who died in the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "It's good that public officials come to our funerals and honor us
for 9/11 heroism," said Steve Cassidy, who heads the Uniformed
Firefighters Assn. "But we need a living wage. We deserve it--and we
don't have it."</LD>
<TE>   New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who does not enjoy sparring
with firefighters, insists his hands are tied by the city's looming
$5-billion budget deficit. He has asked all city agencies, including
the Fire Department, to prepare for deep cuts in next year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters should not expect any miracles, he adds, at a time
when the city may have to consider raising property taxes and
increasing transit fares. But that does not stop him from praising
the Fire Department..</TE>
<TE>   "For people all over the world, the acronym FDNY has come to stand
for the ultimate in courage and professionalism," the mayor said last
week as he swore in 228 probationary firefighters at Brooklyn
College.</TE>
<TE>   "You now join a Fire Department that has earned its reputation as
New York's bravest," he added, without mentioning the touchy issue of
money.</TE>
<TE>   The 9,000 members of New York's Fire Department, the nation's
largest, have worked without a contract for the last 27 months and
have not had a raise in 40 months. Their pay is low compared with
salaries earned by counterparts in other big cities, as well as in
smaller towns surrounding New York.</TE>
<TE>   A rookie firefighter in New York City, for example, earns $32,724
annually, compared with $54,211 in Yonkers, a small town north of the
city.</TE>
<TE>   The disparity is even more pronounced when it comes to New York
City firefighters' rate of salary increase over the last five years
compared with other jurisdictions with at least 1 million residents.
New York has a 21.7% rate, trailing Los Angeles County (43.9%), the
city of Los Angeles (40.3%), Chicago (39.8%), Philadelphia (36.9%)
and Detroit (28.6%), according to a study by the International Assn.
of Firefighters, based in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Given their sacrifices on Sept. 11, New York firefighters say, the
city should make a financial exception and give them a generous pay
increase.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at special circumstances," said a firefighter
standing outside a station house on Manhattan's Upper East Side,
insisting on anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the
negotiations. He gestured to photos of six colleagues who perished at
the World Trade Center and shook his head, saying: "I can't believe
they won't make us a decent offer."</TE>
<TE>   As the city's economic situation continues to deteriorate,
however, some observers say the union might never get the deal it
wants. New York's most recent offer, which was spurned by union
delegates, called for an 11.5% increase over 30 months. Firefighters
had been hoping for a raise along the lines of the 16% to 23%
increases recently given to members of the politically powerful
United Federation of Teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg quickly criticized the 365-2 vote by UFA delegates
against the city's proposal, cautioning union members that they
should not expect any sudden burst of generosity, given the deepening
fiscal crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, their [firefighters'] time has passed," said Chuck
Brecher, research director for the Citizens Budget Commission, a
watchdog group. "The discussion and the public is mainly focusing on
the budget crisis."</TE>
<TE>   This is particularly galling to the firefighters, because they had
kept a fairly low profile as Bloomberg approved separate wage deals
with the teachers and the Policemen's Benevolent Assn. They postponed
their consideration of the 11.5% offer, in fact, because it was made
weeks before the terrorist attacks, and union leaders of the
traumatized department said they needed a year of recovery before
reentering the labor fray.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Cassidy and other union officials have locked horns
with the city over other issues, including whether New York City
equipped its firefighters with two-way radios that badly
malfunctioned on Sept. 11, leading to the department's high death
toll.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, we're not talking about breaking the bank with a pay
raise," said Tom Butler, a spokesman for the firefighters' union.
"This is a simple matter of equity for people who put their lives on
the line every day."</TE>
<TE>   Many rookie firefighters, he said, cannot afford to raise a family
in New York City on $32,724 a year. As a result, Butler added, they
either put off starting a family or work second jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the economic hardships, he said, the department's low wage
scale could make it increasingly difficult to recruit applicants in
years ahead, especially from minority communities. The FDNY, which is
90% white male, is one of the least diverse big-city departments in
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the union vote, Bloomberg said "we are disappointed"
at the firefighters' salary demands. He vowed that New York City
leaders would continue to negotiate a wage package in good faith--but
with no illusions.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Cassidy, who has been a firefighter since 1988, seems to be
digging in for a long battle. He is banking that sympathy for the
plight of New York firefighters will make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been showered with accolades," he said. "But these
accolades do not feed families or pay mortgages. It's time to do the
right thing."</TE>

<HD>House Passes $355-Billion Defense Spending Measure</HD>
<DH>Budget: The bill gives President Bush most of what he
requested after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It garners bipartisan
support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House overwhelmingly approved on Thursday a compromise
$355.4-billion defense bill brimming with money for new destroyers,
helicopters and missiles and granting President Bush most of the
Pentagon buildup he requested following last year's terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   While the day's spotlight shone on the congressional debate over
authorizing Bush to use force against Iraq, the massive defense
spending package--one-sixth of the entire federal budget--underlined
the bipartisan consensus behind beefing up the military. Quick Senate
approval also was expected, and White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said Bush looks forward to signing the measure into law
because it will "ensure that we provide our troops in the field with
the resources they need to fight terrorism and defend freedom."</LD>
<LD>   The bill's 409-14 passage, less than four weeks before
congressional elections, also reflected a desire by Democrats to head
off campaign-season accusations by Bush that they had delayed a
measure urgently needed in the U.S. effort against terrorism. Most of
Congress' budget work has been stalled because Bush wants to spend
less than Democrats and even some Republicans want.</LD>
<TE>   The bill's popularity also was a tribute to the billions it would
spend from coast to coast for weapons and other equipment. Included
is $3.3 billion for 15 Air Force C-17 transport aircraft--$586
million more than Bush requested--which the Boeing Co. has been
building in Long Beach, and $270 million for 19 Army Black Hawk
helicopters--seven more than Bush sought--built by the Sikorsky
Aircraft Corp. of Stratford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   As lawmakers sorted through a pile of legislation in hopes of
recessing soon for the elections, the House approved a $10.5-billion
military construction bill, 419-0.</TE>
<TE>   By 272-144, the House also approved a bill keeping federal
agencies open for another week, a measure necessitated by the
spending battle between Bush and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   And seeking to avoid a repeat of the disputed 2000 presidential
contest, the House passed a measure to implement one of the biggest
upgrades ever to the country's election system. On a vote of 357 to
48, the measure was sent to the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Hailed as the first major civil rights legislation of the 21st
century, the $3.9-billion measure would help states replace
antiquated voting machines, create statewide computerized
registration systems, improve access to the voting booth for the
disabled and adopt new anti-fraud provisions.</TE>
<TE>   "The modernization of this system will ensure that each voter who
wants to vote is given that opportunity while ensuring that each vote
is counted only once," said House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an
Illinois Republican.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would require states to comply with a number of new
federal election standards, such as permitting people to check
ballots and correct errors before their votes are counted and
defining what constitutes a vote on various machines.</TE>
<TE>   For now, all congressional action was colored by the Nov. 5
elections, when control of the House and Senate for the next two
years will be decided.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to focus voters on issues that could help Democrats, the
party's leaders invited press coverage of a forum they were staging
today on retirement security, corporate responsibility and whether
the economy is on the right track.</TE>
<TE>   To counter that, House Republicans were preparing a tax-cut
package that includes bigger breaks for stock market losses and for
people trying to rebuild depleted individual retirement accounts and
401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   "For the next four weeks there's going to be a lot of debate about
the economy," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) told
reporters. "Once we get this question of Iraq behind us, I think the
American people are going to focus even more."</TE>
<TE>   The defense bill, for the federal budget year that started Oct. 1,
represents an increase of $34 billion, or 11%, over last year. Bush
sought $367 billion but ran into bipartisan distaste for his proposal
for a $10-billion fund he could tap without congressional input for
combating terrorists over- seas.</TE>
<TE>   From weapons procurement and research to the costs of training
troops, virtually every category of Pentagon spending is being beefed
up. Included in the bill is money for a 4.1% pay raise for military
personnel, for two more AEGIS destroyers and a new attack submarine,
and nearly all of the $7.4 billion Bush requested to continue
developing a national missile defense system.</TE>
<TE>   Following a deal struck earlier this year, the bill would follow
Bush's lead and scuttle the Army's high-technology Crusader artillery
program and provide $369 million to develop alternatives.</TE>

<HD>Rep. Mink's Name Will Remain on Hawaii Ballot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>The name of Rep. Patsy Mink, who died Sept. 28, will stay on the
ballot for the Nov. 5 election, the state's chief election officer
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Hawaii Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to order Mink's name
removed, saying election official Dwayne Yoshina has the discretion
to decide if her name should be replaced.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, state Atty. Gen. Earl Anzai, at Gov. Ben Cayetano's
request, had petitioned to remove Mink's name and allow the
Democratic Party to choose a new candidate.</LD>
<TE>   Yoshina said he decided to leave Mink's name on the ballot after
discussing the situation Wednesday with Anzai.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, what I got was that the A.G. has said we're going to
run the two elections," Yoshina said. "I agree with that and let's
move forward."</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court's ruling Wednesday, coupled with an earlier
decision denying a petition to hold a special election to fill the
remainder of Mink's term on the same day as the Nov. 5 general
election, means voters on parts of Oahu and on all the other islands
will be casting 2nd District votes as many as three times:</TE>
<TE>   * Nov. 5, with Mink on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   * Nov. 30, for the remainder of her term.</TE>
<TE>   * Jan. 4, for the next term, if Mink wins.</TE>
<TE>   Cayetano has estimated the costs of two special elections at $3
million, and has defended the state's petitions to the Supreme Court,
saying he was trying to spare taxpayers a financial burden.</TE>
<TE>   Mink died of pneumonia two days after the deadline for replacing
her name on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   While the high court left open the possibility that Yoshina could
have Mink's name replaced, Yoshina said any change in the ballot
would have to have been made by Thursday, when the new ballots are
sent to the printer.</TE>
<TE>   Also, some absentee overseas ballots already have been printed and
mailed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Losing Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ed Case and 23 other
candidates already have filed to run in the Nov. 30 special election.</TE>

<HD>GOP Hopeful Drops Out of Montana Senate Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HELENA, Mont.</DL>
<LD>Republican Mike Taylor abruptly dropped out of the Senate race
against Sen. Max Baucus on Thursday, complaining that a Democratic
Party ad was calculated to make him look like a gay hairdresser.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor, who was trailing Baucus badly in the polls, said the
commercial amounted to character assassination.</LD>
<LD>   The ad included footage of Taylor in an open-necked shirt applying
lotion to the face of a man sitting in a barber's chair. Republicans
say the ad implies Taylor, who is married, is gay.</LD>
<TE>   Brad Martin, executive director of the Montana Democratic Party,
denied use of the old tape was intended to suggest Taylor is gay.</TE>
<TE>   Choking back tears, with his wife, Janna, by his side, Taylor
said: "I'm willing to suspend my campaign because my opponent's lies
about me are hurting my wife, my family, my friends, my party and
most of all, Montanans from all walks of life."</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped another Republican would step forward as a
write-in candidate and keep Baucus from winning election to a fifth
term Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Montana law bars the replacement of a candidate if he withdraws
within 85 days of the election, and state GOP officials said there
were no plans to try to get around the deadline, as the Democrats did
last week in New Jersey's Senate race.</TE>

<HD>Piling On the Mustard, With Relish</HD>
<DH>A museum in a Wisconsin farm town offers a rich slice of
Americana. Such quirky collections are far more than idle
curiosities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOUNT HOREB, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Behold, mustard:</LD>
<LD>   Basil pesto mustard and merlot chocolate mustard. Lemon peppercorn
mustard and bourbon molasses mustard. Curried apricot. Martini. Key
lime macadamia mustard.</LD>
<LD>   Mustard in jars, in tubes, in pots. Mustard from Azerbaijan and
mustard from Zimbabwe. Mustard seeds, mustard rubs. Mustard ointments
galore.</LD>
<TE>   It's all here, lovingly displayed, meticulously cataloged, at the
Mount Horeb Mustard Museum, a shrine to the pungent condiment
that--according to curator Barry Levenson--goes perfectly with
everything from hot dogs to creme brulee.</TE>
<TE>   In the great American tradition of blending kitsch and culture,
the storefront museum has been drawing tourists by the tens of
thousands to this quirky little town for a decade. With its 3,950
jars of mustard stacked on floor-to-ceiling shelves, it occupies the
first ranks of what academics politely call "oddball
museums"--exhibits that expound obsessively on a mundane theme, be it
vinegar or Jell-O, bananas or Spam.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider them American treasures," said Christopher Steiner, a
professor of museum studies at Connecticut College.</TE>
<TE>   Some are sponsored by manufacturers as a tribute to a popular
product (or a shameless marketing ploy, as the case may be). Hormel
Foods, for instance, just opened a Spam Museum in Austin, Minn.;
after walking through a giant blue-and-yellow Spam tin, tourists join
a mock production line to practice canning salted pork shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Others highlight regional ties. The Jell-O Museum in LeRoy, N.Y.,
run by a historical society, describes how a local carpenter invented
the jiggly dessert--while experimenting with a laxative tea.</TE>
<TE>   But for sheer loopy joy, nothing can compete with the collections
amassed by single-minded zealots determined to know everything there
is to know about pretzels or Pez candy.</TE>
<TE>   No one is quite sure how many of these oddball exhibits exist,
because many are set up in private homes, open by appointment only.
Officially, the Institute of Museums and Library Services in
Washington classifies them as "collections of curiosities," not
educational enough to gain true museum status. But some academics are
not so quick to dismiss them as random junk.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something about bringing [ordinary objects] together as a
collection that lets you see a phenomenon in a way you wouldn't
otherwise.... And there's something about the relentless focus of
really hard-core collectors that's impressive and intriguing in its
own right," said Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, a professor at New
York University who has written extensively about the interplay
between food and culture.</TE>
<TE>   "What the Museum of Modern Art does in classifying paintings by
genre and period--that's the same thing that the Mustard Museum or
the beer can museum or the nut museum is doing," Steiner said. "Only,
unlike modern minimalist art, these museums are dealing with
something that everyone can relate to."</TE>
<TE>   Take bananas. They merit not one, but two packed-to-brimming
museums. A warehouse in Altadena is stuffed with 17,000 objects, from
a banana putter for the golfer to banana-alcohol soda to a
banana-shaped couch. And a yellow-fruit fan in Auburn, Wash., has
opened a more modest museum in her home with 4,000 items of banana
memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Or consider the International Vinegar Museum in Roslyn, S.D.,
featuring a tasting bar where visitors can daub their tongues with
coconut vinegar, pecan vinegar, or vinegar flavored with violets.
Curator Lawrence Diggs (who answers the phone with an exuberant,
"Hello, Vinegar Man here") has amassed more than 300 varieties from
near and far--far being Sri Lanka and Mongolia. The museum attracts
about 4,000 visitors a year to Roslyn (population 250).</TE>
<TE>   That's 4,000 people a year driving through South Dakota to look at
vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   Ten times that many flock to the bright yellow halls of the
Mustard Museum here in the rolling farmland of southwest Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fantastic," explained Jan Wegenka, 71, a Michigan native
making a repeat visit with his wife. The one drawback, he said, was
that the free pretzels provided for tasting did not, so to speak, cut
the mustard.</TE>
<TE>   "You should come here with a Polish kielbasa," he advised.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, it might have been more practical, Levenson says,
to set up his homage to "Shakespeare's favorite condiment" in a more
lively hub of tourism. But, like Vinegar Man (who rather wistfully
promotes Roslyn as "equally close to all the coasts"), Levenson
figured true pilgrims would make the trek to his shrine no matter the
address. So he leased a storefront on Main Street in Mount Horeb, his
adopted hometown.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, this funky community of 4,000 was a perfect
match. Mount Horeb, about half an hour's drive from Madison, is not
your typical Midwestern farm town. There's a thriving Wiccan
community. A dozen boutiques sell crafts and crystals. And the
business district is dubbed "The Trollway" because it's lined with
little wooden trolls.</TE>
<TE>   The Mustard Museum beckons passing tourists with 7,700 square feet
of what Levenson calls "the condiment of good taste and good
breeding." More than half the space is given over to the gift shop,
which sells dozens of exotic brands in a swirl of sweet and spicy
scents wafting over from the tasting table.</TE>
<TE>   The museum, which does not charge admission, displays mustard
remedies, mustard ads and antique mustard pots. The chief draw,
though, is the wall lined with mustards arranged alphabetically by
origin--the 38 from New Zealand wedged between the two from Nepal and
the six from Norway.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists just stand there and gape.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Susan Hutton, a Wisconsin native, brought a Spanish
exchange student to see the collection. It seemed her duty as a host.</TE>
<TE>   "He had to come see this. It's such great Americana," Hutton
explained.</TE>
<TE>   The student, 17-year-old Jaime Fontanals, looked a bit baffled,
but pronounced himself suitably impressed: "It is an original
museum," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even aficionados of rival condiments are envious.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to go there someday to see how they do it," said Mike
Gassman, president of the fan club for the World's Largest Ketchup
Bottle, a roadside icon in Collinsville, Ill. "Of course," he added,
in a conspiratorial whisper, "we'll have to go incognito."</TE>
<TE>   As most visitors soon find out, the curator is key to the Mount
Horeb mustard experience.</TE>
<TE>   Levenson, 54, bounds frenetically through his museum, dark hair
flopping on his forehead, T-shirt invariably emblazoned with mustard
propaganda. He may pull out a mustard magazine ad from the 1920s or
direct a tourist to a particularly beautiful mustard pot. Now and
then, he'll order a hapless customer in his gift shop to sing the
Poupon U anthem he composed to the tune of the Notre Dame fight song:</TE>
<TE>   "Eat, eat, at old Poupon U, bratwursts and hot dogs, hamburgers,
too, all with mustard spread on thick. We never eat ketchup because
it makes us sick!"</TE>
<TE>   When he's not accosting tourists or writing nonfiction (his latest
book is "Habeas Codfish: Reflections on Food and the Law"), Levenson
is tinkering in his kitchen. His most recent concoction: mustard
creme brulee. He's still fine-tuning the recipe. But he insists it
tastes almost great. In the meantime, he offers mustard brownies for
dessert.</TE>
<TE>   "They're really good," he insists. "You can add mustard to
chocolate cake too. It intensifies the flavor; gives it a little
kick."</TE>
<TE>   Levenson, it should be obvious, is a man obsessed.</TE>
<TE>   It all began when his beloved Boston Red Sox lost the World Series
in 1986. Levenson found himself wandering the aisles of a supermarket
in Madison at 2:30 a.m., looking for something he could collect as a
distraction from baseball. He landed in the mustard aisle and picked
up 10 jars that looked intriguing.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like a little kid with his first pack of baseball cards,"
Levenson said. "I started wondering--are there 100 brands? Are there
200? It was an open-ended adventure."</TE>
<TE>   So he began prowling groceries and food shows. As his collection
grew, Levenson fantasized about leaving his job as an assistant state
attorney general and spreading the gospel of mustard full time. He
finally emptied his savings account and went for it.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, his museum has signed on several mustard companies
and a pretzel maker as corporate sponsors. The gift shop racks up
annual sales of close to $900,000. Mount Horeb closes off Main Street
for the annual Mustard Day street fair, which features free hot dogs
for all (free, that is, unless you want ketchup, in which case,
there's a $10 charge). Levenson even puts out a monthly e-mail
newsletter for condiment aficionados. It is, as he puts it, "yellow
journalism at its best."</TE>
<TE>   Levenson's wife, Patti (they met at a mustard tasting in
Milwaukee), answers to "Mrs. Mustard" and works beside him in the
museum, having convinced herself that her husband's passion is more
than a hobby--it's a calling. A self-described "total foodie," she
even puts up with the mustard cuisine--though she's not sure about
the creme brulee. "It's not to where I love it yet," she says.</TE>
<TE>   As the head of this mustard empire, Levenson earns less than half
what he made as a prosecutor. But he would never go back.</TE>
<TE>   "I get to see smiles on a lot of people's faces," he said. "That's
not something a lot of lawyers can say."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, coaxing smiles is another of Levenson's passions.</TE>
<TE>   He loves to tell the story of the day in 1987 when he argued a
case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court with a jar of mustard in his
pocket. He had spotted the unusual brand on a room service tray as he
left his hotel, and scooped it up.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think about it, though," he says with a grin, "the Supreme
Court is where Felix Frankfurter once worked, and Warren Burger too,
so there's poetic justice for you." The historic jar of Dickinson's
stone ground is honored with a special display in the museum. And
yes, he won the case.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people come in here and say, 'You used to be a lawyer,
and now you're doing this?' " Levenson said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I've got a greater opportunity to enrich people's lives by
selling mustard than by practicing criminal law."</TE>
<TE>   And he might yet sell Mrs. Mustard on the creme brulee.</TE>

<TE>   Historical Spread</TE>
<TE>   Mustard is one of the world's oldest known condiments. Mustard
seeds have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs.</TE>
<TE>   Medieval monks perfected the art of making a mustard sauce in the
Dijon region of France in the early 14th century.</TE>
<TE>   Horseradish mustard from the English town of Tewkesbury gained
fame in the 17th century. Shakespeare even alluded to it in Henry IV
Part II: "His wit's as thick as Tewkesbury mustard!"</TE>
<TE>   Francis French, a New York spice merchant, developed a mild yellow
mustard sauce at the beginning of the 20th century. It was unveiled,
with great fanfare, at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis--along with
other culinary treasures such as the hot dog and the ice cream cone.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, mustard has been touted as a remedy for everything
from arthritis to toothaches to sore throats to snake bites. One
Depression-era magazine ad for Coleman's double superfine mustard
advised: "When your tired husband returns from his day's work, serve
Coleman's mustard with his dinner. Lack of exercise and the
confinement of office work tend to produce indigestion." The mustard,
the ad counseled, was a perfect tonic.</TE>

<HD>Portland Terror Suspect Released Pending Trial</HD>
<DH>Court: The government failed to show that October Lewis is
a flight risk, the judge says. She is one of six accused of backing
Al Qaeda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled Thursday that a woman accused of plotting to
wage war against the United States must be freed pending her trial
because prosecutors could not prove she posed a threat or was likely
to flee.</LD>
<LD>   October M. Lewis, one of six people whom authorities have
identified as members of a Portland-based terrorist cell supportive
of Al Qaeda, was ordered released here by Judge Janice M. Stewart.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't believe the government met the standard of clear and
convincing evidence" to keep Lewis jailed, Stewart said. She imposed
conditions for the release that include electronic monitoring and
requirements that Lewis find a job or attend school, and live with a
friend.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors immediately requested a review of the magistrate's
order by the presiding judge in the case--a request Stewart granted.
U.S. District Judge Ancer L. Haggerty could reverse Stewart's
decision today.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is accused of sending money to her ex-husband, Jeffrey L.
Battle, and other men who were in Asia last year in what the
government says was a foiled attempt to reach Afghanistan to join
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters battling U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors presented new evidence during the detention hearing,
including further details of the group's travel arrangements,
e-mails, seized documents and transcripts of surreptitiously taped
remarks by Battle.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. David Atkinson said the government
tape-recorded Battle saying he wanted to fight the U.S. in
Afghanistan and that he also "intended to engage in some form of
violent activity here domestically against Jewish synagogues."
Atkinson said Battle was recorded saying he would not carry out such
attacks as suicide missions "because he wanted to live to witness"
the events.</TE>
<TE>   Battle was also recorded saying he felt he was "behind enemy
lines" in the U.S. "working undercover on behalf of radical Islamist
fundamentalism," Atkinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Battle said on tape that he "loved" Osama bin Laden and wanted to
fight in Afghanistan, believing Bin Laden would in turn support his
family financially, Atkinson testified.</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson also told of a book agents found in the Battle family car
titled "Join the Caravan," which he said calls for a war against the
U.S. and includes a jacket endorsement from Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   In presenting the government's case for Lewis' detention, Atkinson
also acknowledged that a "cooperating witness" has provided law
enforcement officials with information on Battle.</TE>
<TE>   John Ransom, Lewis' attorney, argued that the statements
attributed to Battle should not be considered against Lewis. "Mr.
Battle is not having a detention hearing. They are not her [Lewis']
statements. [Prosecutors] are simply trying to prejudice the court."</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson also read from e-mails between Lewis and Battle that told
of plans by Lewis to join her former husband abroad, which he said
shows that Lewis is a flight risk.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing her ruling, Stewart cited Lewis' lack of a criminal
history and said there are "no other indicators of danger to the
community other than what appears to be the offense," and that Lewis
did not pose enough of a flight risk to warrant keeping her jailed.
As Stewart spoke, Lewis' mother, Vivian Lewis, burst into tears in
the back of the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, 25, was arrested with Battle, 32, in a predawn raid last
Friday at their Portland apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Also that day, Patrice Lumumba Ford, 31, was arrested at a nearby
apartment and former Portland resident Muhammad Bilal, 22, was
arrested at his sister's home in Dearborn, Mich. Bilal's older
brother, Ahmed Bilal, 24, turned himself in to Malaysian authorities
Sunday and was deported to the U.S. on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   A sixth man charged in the same operation, Habis Abdulla Al Saoub,
remains at large abroad, authorities said. Al Saoub is a legal
permanent resident of the U.S. born in Jordan. All others are U.S.
citizens born in this country.</TE>
<TE>   All six were indicted and charged with conspiring to levy war
against the U.S. and to provide support to the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
Four of the men--Battle, Ford, Al Saoub and Ahmed Bilal--also face a
weapon charge.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and Battle face detention hearings next week.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was the second terrorism suspect released pending trial this
week. A Buffalo, N.Y., magistrate on Tuesday allowed one of six men
accused of attending a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan to be
released from custody with a $600,000 bond and 16 conditions.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Port Action Puts Economy on the Front Burner</HD>
<DH>Labor: Invoking the Taft-Hartley Act gives president forum
to show he is concerned about fiscal matters. Decision is carefully
calibrated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN and JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When President Bush invoked a rarely used labor law to force the
reopening of West Coast ports this week, he struck a double blow: one
against what government lawyers argued was a threat to economic and
national security, and a second against what pollsters said could be
a threat to Republican political security.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's first use of the Taft-Hartley Act in nearly a
quarter-century followed a carefully choreographed process in which
business groups and administration officials ratcheted up warnings
about the economic and military dangers of the shutdown while the
president stayed above the fray.</LD>
<LD>   Even when he finally acted, Bush was careful to appear
even-handed, noting in an executive order, for example, that the
shutdown was the result of a management "lockout" rather than a
strike by workers.</LD>
<TE>   But a close look at the president's actions suggests that they
were motivated by more than the immediate effects of the shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls show that even as official Washington is riveted by
the prospect of war with Iraq, ordinary Americans are more concerned
about the fragile state of the economy. By putting an end to the
shutdown, Bush was able to act decisively on both issues, and to
present himself as addressing voter worries.</TE>
<TE>   Bush "may have legitimate concerns about the shutdown, but his
actions have the happy side-effect of making him look like he's doing
something about the economy," said American University political
scientist James A. Thurber.</TE>
<TE>   The economy "is the thing that did in [Bush's] father: the public
feeling that this was a foreign policy president," said GOP political
consultant Frank Donatelli. Administration officials "don't want to
leave the impression the president is not interested in the economy."</TE>
<TE>   References to the economy have been winning more prominent billing
in the president's speeches in recent days after more than a month of
intensive focus on Iraq. On Saturday in New Hampshire, Bush opened
his remarks by declaring, "I worry about people being able to find
work in America." It was New Hampshire's economic woes in 1992 that
started the first President Bush's long slide from office.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent poll on voters' concerns, a survey by the
nonpartisan Pew Research Center for the People and the Press released
Thursday, found that 55% of people questioned identified the economy
was the single issue they most wanted candidates to address in the
fall elections, up from 20% in June and far ahead of the 22% who are
most concerned about the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "People recognize the importance of the war; they're concerned
about terrorism," said center director Andrew Kohut. "But if you
think politically, the economy is closer to home for most people."</TE>
<TE>   The ports shutdown itself has contributed to the economic anxiety
in California, according to Republican pollster Stephen M. Kinney.
"We're beginning to see the same thing we saw in the early '90s,"
Kinney said. "People are worried, but it's not about taxes or the
fear of big government, it's more 'Am I going to lose my job?' "</TE>
<TE>   In entering the fray and putting a stop to the shutdown, the
president had to traverse some tricky political terrain, according to
aides and observers. He had to reassure the GOP's traditional
business base that he would act, yet hold off until the damaging
consequences of the lockout were widely apparent. He had to hang on
to what few labor allies the Republican administration has,
especially those in the Teamsters union, and not anger pro-labor
Democrats in Congress whose backing he needs on Iraq and other
issues.</TE>
<TE>   The administration handled its business base by intervening early
in contract talks between the Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents shipping companies and terminal operators, and the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents the
10,500 workers who man the docks, and threatening drastic action if
no settlement was reached.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the White House provided a private briefing for
business lobbyists seeking presidential intervention in advance of
Bush acting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The White House tried to hold onto labor support by having top
Bush aide Karl Rove and Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. call
Teamsters President James P. Hoffa and AFL-CIO President John J.
Sweeney to tout the president's evenhandedness.</TE>
<TE>   "The president's approach [to the shutdown] has been one that
played it down the middle," asserted an administration official
acquainted with the White House handling of ports dispute.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush went before the TV cameras Tuesday afternoon to announce
he would seek a court-ordered end to the labor standoff, he
highlighted the shutdown's economic damage to individual Americans.
"The work stoppage is hurting our entire economy. It is hurting
truckers and rail operators.... It's hurting farmers and ranchers and
manufacturers, retailers and consumers.... ," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the president made comparatively little mention of
the shutdown's effects on the issues that have consumed him this
fall, national security and the case against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But it was quite a different story in the legal briefs the
administration filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco,
successfully seeking a court order ending the shutdown. In these,
government lawyers went to great lengths to portray the country as
effectively at war and argue that the ports shutdown stands in the
way of the war effort.</TE>
<TE>   Citing an affidavit from Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, the
lawyers said that the September 2001 terrorist attacks "mark the
onset of uncommon wartime strains and requirements placed on the
nation's military systems ... "</TE>
<TE>   They charged that these could be "significantly compromised" by
the shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   "If the work stoppage continues," the lawyers said, "it may
degrade military readiness, hinder the department's ability to
prosecute the global war on terrorism, and undercut other defense
needs and worldwide commitments."</TE>
<TE>   The administration's focus on national security was partly
tactical. Under Taft-Hartley, mere economic damage is not grounds for
court action. The government can intervene only if labor disputes
"threaten the national health or safety." That makes the national
security argument the administration's trump card.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said that the White House's public emphasis on
economic consequences of the shutdown and their courtroom emphasis on
national security damages is part of a grand political strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "With Wall Street still soft, plants shutting down" and 401(k)
accounts losing value, "people could easily focus on the economy,"
said independent political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you can get along with just flag-waving in the South, where
patriotism is part of the old, traditional values," but in the rest
of the country, the fragile economy poses a political danger,
Rothenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wise for the White House to inoculate itself," he said.</TE>

<HD>Police Command Post Abuzz in Race to Find Sniper</HD>
<DH>Crime: Federal, state and local investigators work with a
Maryland county department--used to calmer times--as leads keep
pouring in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GETTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROCKVILLE, Md.</DL>
<LD>In calmer days, police used the card table at the headquarters of the
Montgomery County Police Department to cut birthday cakes. But now
the table--and every other available piece of furniture in the
two-story brick building--has been taken over by the nearly 200
federal, state and local investigators who are in a desperate race to
find the killer who is shooting people at random in the Washington,
D.C., area.</LD>
<LD>   Before last week, this police department had just two squads
dedicated to homicides and other major crimes, 18 officers in all.
But in one deadly day, the number of murders this year jumped from 20
to 25--and a sleepy bedroom-community police department found itself
inundated with work, leads and help.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the elusive sniper has killed another man on a street
corner in Washington, shot a 43-year-old Virginia woman as she was
loading packages into her van and critically injured a 13-year-old
Maryland boy who likes math. Wednesday night, he struck again,
killing a 53-year-old engineer at a gas station in Virginia near a
Civil War battlefield.</LD>
<TE>   After Monday's shooting of the schoolboy, Montgomery County Police
Chief Charles A. Moose formally asked the federal government for
help, citing a federal law that allows the Justice Department to
investigate local crimes involving serial killings.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft immediately vowed to keep the federal
resources flowing.</TE>
<TE>   So many agents from so many agencies have flooded the command
center at police administration headquarters that some are working
while standing.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen people in this building I've never seen before," said
Officer Derek Baliles, a department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   There is no room for more tables and chairs. Phone lines have been
added to handle the crush.</TE>
<TE>   But Moose remains in charge, appearing several times a day on live
television to brief the media and taking advice from the more
experienced hands around him. "It would be much more difficult" if
his 1,074 officers had to handle the case on their own, the chief
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   The department isn't even fully staffed. A banner outside
proclaims, "NOW HIRING."</TE>
<TE>   But for a low-crime department, the chief and his investigators
have earned the respect of the outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's his show and I have 100% confidence in him," said Gary M.
Bald, the FBI special agent in charge of the Baltimore regional
office. Bald, like dozens of other federal agents, has been involved
in the investigation since day one.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI showed up last Friday with its own computer system, which
is operating 24 hours a day. "They rolled the system in on wheels,"
Baliles said.</TE>
<TE>   As tips pour into the department, which has set up a special phone
number to handle the calls, officers entered them on a standardized
form, which is then typed into the FBI's Rapid Start computer
program. The FBI used the same case management program after last
year's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very effective," the FBI's Bald said. "It helps prioritize
tips and track leads."</TE>
<TE>   So far, more than 8,000 tips have poured in, of which at least
1,600 have been ruled worthy of further investigation. "They've
provided forms for us," Baliles said. "We're copying and copying and
copying."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has also provided agents, helicopters and a geographical
and psychological profile of the killer, which is constantly
evolving. "From my experience generally, profiles are never
complete," Bald said. "They're a work in progress."</TE>
<TE>   Agents from the Secret Service and U.S. Marshals Service are also
providing help, acting as investigators, uniformed security or just
plain administrators.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has lent about
100 agents to the investigation--as well as five Labrador retrievers
trained to sniff out gunshot residue.</TE>
<TE>   "Agents are developing leads. Forensic examiners are working on
the case. Our ballistics identification network is working on this,"
said Mike Bouchard, the ATF special agent in charge of the Baltimore
regional office.</TE>
<TE>   ATF agents are trying to see whether any of the ballistic evidence
taken from the shooting victims matches any other shooting across the
country, Bouchard said. The ATF national lab is in Rockville, not far
from the police command post.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, ATF agents went to the hospital where the boy who was
shot was taken, to get the bullet fragments that surgeons had removed
from his chest, then hurried them back to the lab for testing to see
whether they matched the other Maryland shootings. They did.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe the sniper is using an assault or
high-powered rifle that shoots .223-caliber bullets, rounds so deadly
that they can penetrate bulletproof vests.</TE>
<TE>   Their only known lead so far is a witness account of a six-wheeled
white truck seen speeding from one of the early crime scenes. Police
are trying to find out who owns similar trucks in the Washington
area, what companies use them and who is licensed to drive them. And
they are combing through jail and prison records, trying to see
whether anyone who was recently released fits the killer's profile.</TE>
<TE>   The federal help has given the local investigators needed rest,
Moose said. "Each investigator is now able to spend a little more
time with his thoughts, a little more time to process information."</TE>
<TE>   How difficult is this case? "It's difficult enough that we haven't
got the person," the ATF's Bouchard said.</TE>
<TE>   If the killings go beyond the Washington area, the FBI could end
up in charge of the whole probe. "If it goes multistate, across the
country, that's bigger than we can handle," Baliles said.</TE>

<HD>In the House, It Was a Vote Not Soon Forgotten</HD>
<DH>Scene: Although a historic occasion, there was little
rhetoric. The conclusion felt foregone and the chamber's halls were
eerily quiet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>This was a week of sleepless nights, and Rep. Jane Harman felt it as
she sat outside the House chamber Thursday, a spinach burrito back at
her desk, uneaten. The mail coming in from her South Bay district was
emotional and mostly opposed to a war against Iraq. One letter in
particular stood out: "How will you feel when your constituents start
coming home in body bags?"</LD>
<LD>   But the Democrat from Venice voted yes nonetheless, joining the
majority of her House colleagues in what amounted to a first step
toward war.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a very hard vote. There is no corner on wisdom," Harman
said. "Do I think what we're doing today means we're going to war?
No. I think we're standing up to evil."</LD>
<TE>   After weeks of debate, the House gave President Bush a wide berth
in using military force should diplomacy fail to force Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to give up his suspected supply of lethal
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was historic, authorizing the use of first-strike
capabilities, yet the rhetoric didn't soar, the conclusion felt
foregone and the halls of Congress were so quiet, one might think
they were in there discussing sugar subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   It was hardly the soap opera that played out more than a decade
ago when many of the same lawmakers voted to go after the same brutal
dictator, their speeches gripping as the nation waited, protesters in
the streets chanting: "No blood for oil."</TE>
<TE>   But that was, of course, before Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The country is more focused now," Harman said. "And the
understanding of evil is clearer."</TE>
<TE>   There was little doubt that the Senate would follow suit as it
hunkered down late Thursday in a series of speeches unlikely to
change anyone's mind. On both sides of the Capitol, lawmakers spoke
to nearly empty galleries. Still, many of them said it was a vote
they would not forget.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Alamo) called her parents at 7:30
Thursday morning; they supported her decision to cast a vote for
possible war, even though they didn't necessarily agree.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) had yet to make up her mind by
midday as her staff worked on multiple drafts of a speech, not sure
what it would finally say.</TE>
<TE>   A copy of "The Guns of August," the tome about the start of World
War I cited by President Kennedy during 1962's Cuban missile crisis,
sat on the night table of Rep. Adam B. Schiff. The Burbank Democrat
backed the use of force, a decision sure to disappoint a chunk of his
deeply divided constituency.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think there is a diplomatic way out, a very reasonable
probability that Iraq will accept unfettered inspections," Schiff
said.</TE>
<TE>   The catastrophe of last year's terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon made it difficult for some members to
oppose Bush, or even to hold out for a two-step process forcing him
to exhaust all diplomatic avenues and then return to Congress for
permission to strike.</TE>
<TE>   So they went on record calling Hussein every imaginable synonym
for tyrant, predicting nuclear or chemical doom if he isn't stopped.</TE>
<TE>   The dissenters asked "why now?"--most notably Sen. Robert C. Byrd
(D-W.Va.), who spent hours arguing for restraint, waving his arms and
wagging his finger from the Senate well.</TE>
<TE>   Other opponents were more resigned. Smoke from Rep. Barney Frank's
Macanudo cigar swirled around the House speakers' lobby as his
colleagues stood inside making speeches. A Massachusetts Democrat,
Frank would vote against Bush's request for congressional blessing,
knowing full well his colleagues would never defy the president on
this one.</TE>
<TE>   "They complain, they interrupt, but they don't want to stop it
because if things go wrong, they get blamed," Frank said. "It's
congressional dereliction of duty."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the day was not without its drama. Just as House Majority
Leader Dick Armey of Texas was calling the debate one of the greatest
he had ever heard, two protesters in the House gallery stood up and
started yelling, "No war! No war!"</TE>
<TE>   The Capitol Police moved in posthaste, stepping on the toe of
Hughes Marinella, who said she didn't mind one bit.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guards did a magnificent job," cheered Marinella, who was
visiting Washington with friends from the Cherokee Village Retirement
Community in Arkansas, including Natalie Robinson, who surprised
everyone by yelling "Take 'em away!" as the protesters were put in
handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't like it, they can move to another country,"
Robinson said, as the ladies headed off to further discuss the matter
over lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the country might have agreed, if a recent poll by the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press is any indication. The
survey found that most Americans believe Iraq soon may have a nuclear
weapon and that Hussein should be ousted.</TE>
<TE>   But the citizen call for diplomacy before war seemed equally loud
as several lawmakers reported receiving stacks of mail 3 feet high,
with only a handful favoring military force. One Democratic
congresswoman, who supported the use of force and asked to remain
anonymous, got a missive from her first high school boyfriend
informing her he could no longer support or admire her. "That stung,"
she said somberly.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, there was more opposition in the House than first
predicted--296 for and 133 against, upending predictions made weeks
ago that only a handful would dare reject a get-tough policy on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   They vowed to keep the momentum building, asking voters to call
the White House and tell the president there is a rising wave of
opposition to another war in the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. President, it is not too late," Rep. Bob Filner warned.
"There is a whiff of Vietnam in the air here," the San Diego Democrat
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is division coming to America."</TE>

<HD>9th Sniper Victim Is Confirmed</HD>
<DH>Crime: Tests show that civil engineer gunned down at a gas
station was killed by the same rifle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROCKVILLE, Md.</DL>
<LD>Ballistic tests confirmed Thursday that a Maryland man slain by a
distant gunshot at a Virginia gas station was the ninth victim of the
serial killer circling the Washington Beltway, police officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Northern Virginia police investigators said Dean Harold Meyers,
53, a civil engineer, was shot dead Wednesday night at a service
station in Manassas as he stood near his gray Mazda. Prince William
County police and federal firearms agents said Meyers was killed by a
single shot--identical to .223-caliber rounds that have killed six
others and wounded two over the last week in suburban Maryland and
Virginia, and in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Even before an autopsy yielded bullet fragments connecting Meyers'
slaying with the other victims, police concluded that the
rifle-wielding assailant had struck again. The pattern was strikingly
similar to two service station killings committed by the sniper last
week during a 16-hour shooting spree in suburban Maryland--a solitary
shot fired from hundreds of yards away with near-pinpoint accuracy.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact this happened at a service station, the individual being
shot just before gassing the vehicle, the circumstances speak for
themselves," Prince William County Police Chief Charlie Deane said.</TE>
<TE>   The latest slaying was a taunting reminder of the sniper's ability
to roam the Washington region's highways at will, leaving residents
vulnerable and confounding officials struggling to return schools and
commerce to normal routines.</TE>
<TE>   "This is clearly urban terrorism," said Montgomery County (Md.)
State's Atty. Douglas F. Gansler, whose prosecutors are part of a law
enforcement task force hunting the killer. "This guy has injected
fear into this community down to the marrow."</TE>
<TE>   Public officials across the Washington region continued to take
precautions, limiting outdoor activities at schools, sending police
to patrol campuses and urging residents to remain vigilant.</TE>
<TE>   The killer has surfaced and vanished like heat lightning,
convulsing peaceful stretches of Maryland and Washington, alighting
in Virginia and then lying low for several days at a time before
panicking untouched portions of both states.</TE>
<TE>   "He's telling us he's untouchable and he goes where he wants," one
law enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Manassas shooting was the second in Virginia. Last Friday, the
sniper wounded a woman as she stood near her car in a shopping mall
lot in Fredericksburg. She was released from a hospital this week.
Both Virginia communities are south of Montgomery County, where five
people were gunned down last week and Prince George's County, where a
teenager was wounded this week. A man also was killed in Washington
near the Maryland state line.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the sniper left behind no message. Gray-jacketed
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents did find a
crumpled slip of paper with scribbled handwriting near a motel across
the street from the gas station where Meyers died. But Deane insisted
he was "not aware of any note or anything like that being developed."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a fortune teller's Tarot card was recovered in matted
grass near where the sniper had wounded a 13-year-old student outside
a Bowie, Md., middle school.</TE>
<TE>   The card was printed with a skeletal figure of death and
reportedly bore a taunt, "Dear Mr. Policeman, I am God," and a
request for police to keep its message confidential. Investigators
could not be certain whether the card was the sniper's handiwork or a
prank, but it was turned over to the FBI for fingerprint and genetic
testing.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Meyers was shot about 8:15 p.m. Wednesday as he
stood near a center line of gas pumps at the Battlefield Sunoco, a
station just off Interstate 66 near the Manassas Civil War
battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said he was shot once in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Deane would not comment about the range or type of weapon used by
the sniper. But evidence search teams foraged for hours Thursday
under a slanting rain in foliage several hundred yards from where
Meyers fell.</TE>
<TE>   A witness told investigators that a white panel van drove off
moments after Meyers collapsed between the pump and his car. But
Deane said Thursday night that investigators now doubted it is linked
to the sniper. The driver of a white van approached police earlier in
the day and convinced officials he had no involvement in the
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, it seems likely we may be able to explain that
vehicle," Deane said, adding that the driver's explanation seemed
"reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery County Police Chief Charles A. Moose, who is heading
the combined local, state and federal search for the killer, stood by
his team's week-old alert for a white box truck spotted by witnesses
at several of the earlier shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not changed" the appeal for sightings of the elusive box
truck, Moose said.</TE>
<TE>   The alerts for the white panel van prompted Virginia State Police
to flag down dozens of similar vehicles along Interstate 66 near the
shooting scene. "We began stopping white vans the second [the police
alert] went out," Virginia State Police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Montgomery County town of Gaithersburg, Meyers' neighbors
said they were staggered by his death.</TE>
<TE>   "Such good people, innocent people killed for no reason," said a
friend, Clara Johnson. "This is crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors speculated that Meyers, who lived alone in a red brick
townhouse and was fond of tooling around on his motorcycle, had
stopped at the Battlefield Sunoco station to fill up on gas on the
way home from work.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers had been working late, confirmed Ronald Ewing of Dewberry &amp;
Davis, the Manassas engineering design firm where Meyers had worked
for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all going to miss him," Ewing said.</TE>
<TE>   The victim of Monday's shooting, the 13-year-old middle school
student, was still in critical but stable condition, officials at
Children's National Medical Center in Washington said. Recovering
from severe blood loss and damage to his stomach, pancreas, spleen
and lung, the youth was breathing with the aid of ventilation
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a fighter, and we remain optimistic," said a cousin, Wayne
Curtis. "Doctors have told us this is a marathon, not a sprint." The
Parent Teacher Student Organization at the wounded boy's school
raised $200 for his family this week and plans a vigil.</TE>
<TE>   The youth's friends have returned to class at Benjamin Tasker
Middle School, but many remain fearful.</TE>
<TE>   The school reported that as many as a third of its students stayed
home in the first days after the shooting, but attendance has slowly
risen.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone can get shot for no apparent reason," said Brandon Tyler,
13, a close friend of the unidentified young victim.</TE>
<TE>   "That's got to be a sick person--to shoot a child."</TE>

<HD>Stiff Anti-Smoking Plan Focus of a Heated Hearing in N.Y.C.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Friends and foes of a proposal to ban smoking in all New York City
bars and restaurants faced off Thursday in a contentious hearing over
what would be one of the strictest anti-smoking laws in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who proposed the stiff ban, kicked off
the City Council hearing by arguing that the measure is a workplace
issue allowing bar and restaurant employees to work in a smoke-free
environment.</LD>
<LD>   "It will preserve lives, extend lives, save lives," Bloomberg
testified before the council, which must approve the law. "In fact,
it will almost certainly save more lives than any other proposal that
will ever come before this chamber."</LD>
<TE>   At the first of two scheduled meetings, a heckler shouted from the
balcony and many in the packed room carried signs and sported
stickers for and against the proposal. Others stood in line outside
the gates around City Hall, hoping to get in.</TE>
<TE>   A vote on the proposal, which would make bars, restaurants,
private clubs and bowling alleys entirely smoke-free, is not expected
for at least a month.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly stiff anti-smoking laws are in effect in California.</TE>

<HD>Symbolism Frames Race for Governor</HD>
<DH>Texas: In an extremely expensive fight over a traditionally
weak office, the election will test whether the state is ready for a
Latino leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The men who drawled their way through their first debate could have
stepped straight from the Texas imagination: a cotton farmer and an
oil baron, men who talked plain and pious, jabbed indignant fingers
and decried each other's trickery.</LD>
<LD>   The two candidates vying to take over George W. Bush's old job
could hardly be called political opposites. Incumbent Rick Perry, 52,
was a rural Democrat from the old Southern tradition who reinvented
himself as a Republican midway through his career. Tony Sanchez, 59,
is a high-rolling Democrat and sometime Republican supporter who
slips easily between Spanish and English. They are both moderate
Bush-lovers who'd rather swallow fire than be tagged "liberal."</LD>
<LD>   In a state legendary for political theater, this fall's
gubernatorial campaign is the most expensive in Texas history--and
one of the nastiest. It's a fight over a relatively weak
governorship, and analysts say neither candidate, if elected, is
likely to stage any substantial policy shake-up. Still, the election
is heavy with symbolic significance.</LD>
<TE>   The tally will test whether Texas is ready to elect a Latino
governor--and will measure just how much progress Democrats have made
in a land they expect to reclaim from Republicans as the Latino
population continues to flourish. "A Sanchez victory would send a
disastrous signal to the entire Republican Party," University of
Houston political scientist Richard Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   With election day drawing near, the tumult has been steady.
Televisions flash a constant stream of bilious advertisements
courtesy of Perry and Sanchez. Sanchez says Perry drove up electric
bills; Perry comes back with an ad implying that Sanchez's bank
laundered drug money. And on it goes. The barrage of pricey
advertisements might help explain the cascade of $72 million in
campaign cash the two men have already run through. Sanchez shelled
out almost $58 million of that, most of it coming straight from his
pocket.</TE>
<TE>   This week, former state Atty. Gen. Dan Morales broke with fellow
Democrats to endorse Perry. Morales lost the Democratic nomination
last spring to Sanchez's flawless Spanish and enthused talk of
affirmative action. These days, Morales calls Sanchez "divisive."</TE>
<TE>   "I think what the voters got to see this evening is someone who's
frankly not ready for prime time," said Morales, who watched
Wednesday's debate in pinstripes and cowboy boots.</TE>
<TE>   If their ideas stayed cloaked in vagaries and tangible policy
disputes were few and far between, the debate did manage to draw
sharp contrasts in the men's styles.</TE>
<TE>   A measured Perry offered up a parade of concise slogans. Over and
over, he repeated his mantra: "Experience." Seventeen years, to be
exact, he reminded the audience three times. He responded to
questions with a few snappy lines--"I believe in preparations for the
future, not reparations for the past"--then shut his mouth and waited
for his time to run out.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez poured his words out in a rush, pounding out strings of
examples until the moderator interrupted. When the cameras stopped
rolling, Sanchez swept from the stage in the crush of his wife and
four adult children, burst into a gathering of reporters and
proclaimed himself the winner. "I'm pumped," Sanchez said. "I feel
good; feel like I beat him."</TE>
<TE>   Perry, meanwhile, slipped onto the arm of his wife, flashed a
dimpled grin and a triumphant thumb to the audience--and disappeared
for the rest of the night, leaving his spokesmen to talk to
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the free spending, Sanchez is straggling behind Perry in
the polls. The first thing most voters know about him is that he's
rich--an oil, gas and banking baron who grew up in the Texas
borderlands.</TE>
<TE>   The state's first Mexican American nominee from one of the two
major political parties, Sanchez has framed himself as a political
outsider: a tough minority businessman who will brush away the pomp
and pork of Perry and his ilk--whom Sanchez dismisses as "career
politicians"--and make appointments whose race and ethnic diversity
"reflect the face of Texas."</TE>
<TE>   "I am a minority," Sanchez reminded the audience at Rice
University on Wednesday night. But he needs the white centrist vote,
and has veered from deep ethnic discussion ever since the messy
primary campaign. "By no means is he running as la raza unida,"
University of Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez took some blows early on, when Republicans plundered his
past for scandalous tidbits. In the early 1980s, Mexican drug-money
launderers deposited $25 million into one of Sanchez's banks. The
troubled Tesoro Savings and Loan of Laredo went on to fail in 1988
because of bad loans, a collapse that cost taxpayers a $161-million
bailout. In the early 1990s, Sanchez paid a $1-million settlement to
end a federal review.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the voting records, showing that Sanchez didn't vote in
the last gubernatorial election, capping years of spotty political
participation. "In fact, if you add it up, I've been elected
statewide more times than he's voted in the last decade," Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   Perry has hit hard times of his own in recent weeks, as a
festering homeowners insurance shortfall bloomed into a full-scale
crisis. With hundreds of thousands of families unprotected, Sanchez
has blasted Perry for ignoring the rising rates in exchange for hefty
donations from insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   All the same, the lanky farm boy from the tiny town of Paint Creek
is still the favorite. Perry abandoned the Democratic Party to run
for agriculture commissioner more than a decade ago. He went on to
serve as the elected lieutenant governor until Bush's move to
Washington bumped him into the governor's mansion.</TE>
<TE>   He had barely moved in when he startled the state with a
record-setting flurry of 82 vetoes. In a political outburst that has
gone down in Austin lore as "Bloody Sunday," Perry did away with a
passel of popular bills ranging from a ban on executing the mentally
retarded to a proposed Medicaid redesign.</TE>
<TE>   He set off another scandal when he appointed former Enron
executive Max Eyzaguirre to the Public Utility Commission, then
collected a $25,000 contribution from Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay
the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "Perry has the clear advantage," Murray said. "But it'll be close
down the stretch."</TE>

<TE>   'This resolution gives the president the authority he needs to

neither a Democratic resolution nor a Republican resolution. It is
now a statement of American resolve and values.... Because this

represents a real threat, and because I believe it is important for
America to speak with one voice at this critical moment--I will vote
to give the president the authority he needs.'</TE>

<TE>   'I have looked back through history. I have never seen a situation
where the president of the United States asked for the ability to go
to war alone and yet hasn't told the American people what that would
mean. How many troops would be involved? How many casualties might
there be? Would the U.S. have to foot the entire cost of using force
against Iraq?... What will the cost be to rebuild Iraq?... I cannot
vote for a blank check for unilateral action. I cannot vote for a

<HD>For Dissenters, 'Nos' Were a Vote of Conscience</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>They spurned the president. They broke ranks with party leaders. And
they asserted that the American people and history were on their
side.</LD>
<LD>   They were the dissenters: 133 House members who voted Thursday and
23 senators who voted early today against a resolution to grant
President Bush broad authority to make war against Iraq if diplomacy
fails to stop the threat posed by Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   As they spoke, the dissenters made clear their revulsion of the
Baghdad regime.</LD>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein is a disturbed, dangerous leader. We should deal
with him," said Rep. Amo Houghton of New York, one of only six House
Republicans to vote against the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   But Houghton said the time is not right. "Why don't we win the war
against terrorism before we start another fight?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   For Houghton and a handful of others in Congress, the vote was
something of a reversal. He voted for the 1991 Persian Gulf War
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Most who voted against this year's Iraq resolution were Democrats:
126 in the House and 21 in the Senate. That was not necessarily a
surprise. Bush's relations with Democrats have frequently been
strained.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of Democrats who dissented was nonetheless
striking. Democratic leaders had figured that at least half of their
208 members in the House would back the resolution after Minority
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) endorsed it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, more than three in five House Democrats--including
Gephardt's top lieutenant, Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi of San
Francisco--were dissenters. Party leadership aides ascribed the large
"no" vote to three factors.</TE>
<TE>   First, they said, Bush has had trouble reaching out to Democrats.
Second, newly drawn district boundaries have increased the job
security of many incumbents. Third, the opponents--including elements
of the vote-counting operation headed by Pelosi--worked hard to round
up votes, while Gephardt did not try to twist arms.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many of the dissenters made clear that the vote was one of
the toughest of their careers. They said they relied more on
conscience than ideology in making up their minds.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Rep. Ed Pastor, the only dissenter from Arizona, said
he opposed a policy of "preemptive attack, which we have so long and
so rightly condemned, without first providing a limited-time option
for peaceful resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Among the no votes, clear patterns emerged along geographic,
racial, ethnic and gender lines.</TE>
<TE>   Eighty of the House dissenters came from the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts, including 24 of the 32 California Democrats. The state's 20
House Republicans voted en masse with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Only 53 House dissenters came from states in the U.S. heartland,
and most of those are from urban areas in populous states such as
Ohio, Texas, Illinois and Michigan. The remainder are often lonely
voices in their state delegations.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Rep. Vic Snyder, for instance, was the only
representative from Arkansas to oppose the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder, a Vietnam War veteran, said the nation's top strategic
goal in the Middle East should be to solve the security issues for
the Israelis and Palestinians--"even if it means 40,000 or 50,000
U.S. troops stationed there for years."</TE>
<TE>   The two largest minority blocs in the House--the Congressional
Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus--voted
overwhelmingly against the resolution. Of 37 African American
lawmakers, 32 were opposed, and of 19 Latinos, 15 were opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Some cited strong anti-war sentiment in their districts.</TE>
<TE>   "In my district, I've only gotten three requests to vote for the
resolution against hundreds and hundreds," said Rep. Diane Watson
(D-Los Angeles), who is African American. Rep. Sam Farr (D-Carmel),
who also voted no, said his mail and phone calls were running 200 to
1 against the White House-backed resolution.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 35 of the 59 women in the House voted no. Their ranks
included Rep. Constance A. Morella (R-Md.).</TE>
<TE>   Morella, who represents a liberal suburb of Washington and is in a
tough reelection contest, objected to taking "this final and
irrevocable step of authorizing full-scale military action" until
every other option is exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   Most opponents said the president should give U.N. inspectors a
chance to find and disable Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Only
if such a last-ditch initiative fails, they said, should Bush come
back to Congress for another vote to authorize military action.</TE>
<TE>   A go-it-alone approach, the dissenters said, would hamper efforts
to build a global coalition against Iraq and could ignite a tinderbox
in the Middle East. "We've seen progress," said Sen. Richard Durbin
(D-Ill.), "but this resolution would brush it all aside."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents also said they were unconvinced that Iraq poses an
imminent threat.</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely no evidence any thinking person could give
that says we are in danger from Saddam Hussein today," said Rep. Pete
Stark (D-Hayward). "You are in more danger from the snipers running
around in Prince George's County," a reference to a recent series of
shootings in Washington's suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Two California Democrats who opposed the 1991 Gulf War resolution,
Reps. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles and Calvin M. Dooley of Fresno,
voted Thursday for the White House-backed resolution.</TE>
<TE>   But one California Democrat switched the other way. Rep. Gary A.
Condit of Ceres, who supported the 1991 resolution, dissented
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate debate ended with a vote early today that also
underscored the Democrats' division.</TE>
<TE>   "Democrats don't walk in lock-step," said Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.), who also opposed the Bush-backed resolution. "We're
independent thinking, and I believe the people want that."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), another dissenter, added: "The
president has not decided that our nation should go to war.... But
this resolution leaves it to the president to make the decision on
his own, without further recourse to Congress or to the American
people."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's arguments, however, couldn't sway his own son. Rep.
Patrick J. Kennedy (D-R.I.) voted for the resolution.</TE>

<LD>Excerpts from Thursday's House debate on a resolution granting
President Bush authority to use military force against Iraq. The
measure passed, 296 to 133.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   'We must now do everything in our power to prevent further
terrorist attacks and ensure that an attack with a weapon of mass
destruction cannot happen. The consequences of such an attack are
unimaginable. We spent 50 years in a Cold War and trillions of
dollars deterring a weapon-of-mass- destruction attack by another
country. Now we must prevent such an attack by terrorists--who,
unlike our previous adversaries, are willing to die.... The 12-year
history of the U.N. effort to disarm Iraq convinces me that Iraq is a
problem that must be dealt with--diplomatically if we can--militarily
if we must.'</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Americans have always had to summon the courage to disregard the
timid counsel of those who would mortgage our security to the false
promises of wishful thinking and appeasement. The perils of
complacency were driven home to us [in September 2001]. We saw in
tragic detail that evil is far more than an abstract concept....
Iraq's vile dictator is a central power in the axis of evil.
President Bush and this Congress are committed to removing the threat
from Saddam Hussein's terror state.'</TE>

<HD>Salmon Expects to Be in the Lineup</HD>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Salmon awoke to a pleasant surprise Thursday: His right
hamstring, which had tightened Wednesday and led to his early exit
from Game 2, felt considerably better. After taking it easy Thursday,
he was optimistic he will be able to play tonight--and somewhat taken
aback by the number of reporters who asked about his fitness.</LD>
<LD>   "It loosened up a lot. I walked around on it with no problem,"
said Salmon, who received a cortisone injection in his leg Wednesday.
"If this was the middle of the season and my hammy got tight, it
wouldn't have been a big deal. It's a big deal because it's
postseason and I came out of the game. I had enough of them over the
course of the year.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not real concerned about it. I know it's day to day. ... Even
[Wednesday] I could have gotten through it and governed it, but is it
worth the chance of making it worse?"</LD>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia said Salmon will be examined today.</TE>
<TE>   "If he can go out there without risking injury, then obviously
he's going to play," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon may have injured the leg while making two running catches
in the first three innings of Game 2, but he is expected to return to
right field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although players claim they always take things one game at a time,
Salmon couldn't help looking ahead to Game 4 on Saturday, when Brad
Radke is expected to start for the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Radke is 11-4 with a 1.72 earned-run average against the Angels
for his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Radke is the Greg Maddux of our league--a finesse pitcher who
changes speeds and has control of all his pitches," Salmon said. "He
turns your at-bats into mental games. You think, 'What's next?' He
doesn't set any patterns and he's not going to give you a pitch in
the same spot twice."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' third and fourth hitters were 0 for 16 in the first
two games against Minnesota, while the Twins' 3-4 hitters were five
for 15. The Angels' 1 through 4 batters were six for 34 (.176), and
the Twins' 1 through 4 batters were eight for 31 (.258). The Angels'
5 through 9 hitters were eight for 35 (.229) compared with the Twins'
eight for 31 (.258).</TE>
<TE>   Both teams were three for nine with runners in scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   Helene Elliott</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Mead, Angel vice president of communications, got a phone call
earlier this week from Chuck Finley, the former Angel pitcher and
franchise player who is scheduled to start Game 3 of the National
League championship series for the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "He said to put your flak jacket on," Mead said, "because we're on
a collision course."</TE>
<TE>   Some crash that would be. Could you imagine Finley, who played 14
years (1986-99) for the Angels and was for so long the team's lone
remaining link to their last playoff appearance in 1986, finally
reaching the World Series and pitching in Edison Field? For the
Cardinals? With former Angel Jim Edmonds behind him in center field?</TE>
<TE>   "That would be the ultimate fun," Mead said. "It would show that
everything worked out for everyone. Jimmy has had the chance to play
in one of America's ultimate baseball cities, and when Chuck said it
was time to move on, he made the playoffs with Cleveland [in 2001]
and now St. Louis. It would be a multidimensional thrill for Chuck to
pitch in our park in the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels made virtually no attempt to re-sign Finley when the
left-hander became a free agent in 1999, and with a surplus of
outfielders, General Manager Bill Stoneman traded the oft-injured and
often-misunderstood Edmonds to the Cardinals for pitcher Kent
Bottenfield and second baseman Adam Kennedy in the spring of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds has been one of the National League's most productive
outfielders since the deal, a key component on Cardinal teams that
reached the playoffs the last two seasons, and Finley went 7-4 with a
3.80 earned-run average in 14 games after being traded from the
Indians to the Cardinals on July 14.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not thinking too far ahead," said Angel closer Troy
Percival, who also talked to Finley last week, "but I'm sure it would
be a lot of fun to meet up with him."</TE>

<TE>   Update--Washburn beat Milton twice this season, 11-3 and 4-2, both
times in Minnesota. In eight starts against the Twins, Washburn is
3-2 with a 3.63 ERA. He loves to face Corey Koskie (0 for 8), Jacque
Jones (.143) and Torii Hunter (.211) and hates to face Doug
Mientkiewicz (.417) and Cristian Guzman (.294). In five career starts
at Edison Field, Milton is 5-0 with a 1.50 ERA. In 1999, he pitched a
no-hitter against the Angels at the Metrodome.</TE>

<HD>NBC Is Entering a New Arena</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Network will increase number of telecasts and
move start date of indoor season to February.</DH>

<LD>NBC, which lost the NFL in 1998, had to endure the fall of the XFL
last year and then lost the NBA, has big plans for the Arena Football
League, which begins its 17th season in February.</LD>
<LD>   NBC announced Thursday it will televise up to 70 games on a
regional basis during the league's 16-week regular season. The
network will televise as many as four games each Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The playoffs begin May 24-25 and conclude with ArenaBowl XVII on
June 22.</LD>
<TE>   League play in the past began in April and concluded in August,
but the start date was changed because of the NBC deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Avengers, Los Angeles' AFL entry, are scheduled for six
regular-season appearances on NBC, but the network has the option of
adding a seventh telecast, the Avengers' May 4 game against Arizona
at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Flexible scheduling is one of the highlights of the 2003 season,
which has been expanded from 14 weeks to 16. The 16-team league
includes the expansion Colorado Crush, which is co-owned by former
Denver Bronco quarterback John Elway.</TE>
<TE>   With the addition of the Crush and the loss of the Toronto
Phantoms, the league realigned its four divisions.</TE>
<TE>   The Crush is in the Western Division along with the Avengers,
Arizona and San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The Avengers open Feb. 2 against the New Jersey Gladiators at
Staples Center. Their second game, also at home, will be against the
defending ArenaBowl champion San Jose SaberCats on Feb. 9. That game
will be televised by NBC.</TE>

<HD>Rodriguez Donates $3.9 Million to Miami</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alex Rodriguez, an All-Star shortstop with the Texas Rangers, donated
$3.9 million to the University of Miami baseball program Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The gift, paid in annual installments over six years, will be used
to renovate the stadium--which will then be called Alex Rodriguez
Park.</LD>
<LD>   "It's something I feel is a responsibility for me," said
Rodriguez, a Miami native. "The city of Miami has done so much for me
in my childhood that it makes me feel really great coming back and
helping out. This was my Yankee Stadium, my Candlestick Park, my
Dodger Stadium."</LD>
<TE>   The 27-year-old Rodriguez, who signed a record $252 million,
10-year contract in December 2000, also vowed to return to the
university and get a degree. Having already taken a few classes at a
community college, he hopes to graduate by age 35.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A baseball fan filed a lawsuit against the Chicago Cubs, accusing
the team of selling overpriced tickets through a subsidiary that
competes with local brokers.</TE>
<TE>   Peter John Cavoto Jr. filed suit against Wrigley Field Premium
Ticket Services. His lawsuit claims that the team uses the outlet to
sell some $36 tickets for up to $130, without first making them
available at face value.</TE>
<TE>   Mark McGuire, executive vice president of business operations for
the Cubs, would not comment about the merits of the lawsuit, but said
the team was "comfortable with the setup" of the subsidiary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Houston Astros declined to exercise their $8 million contract
option for next season on pitcher Shane Reynolds and he becomes
eligible for free agency.... Pittsburgh Pirate Manager Lloyd
McClendon will return in 2003 but will not be offered a contract
extension, and all but two of his coaches were fired or reassigned.
The only coaches returning are pitching coach Spin Williams and
bullpen coach Bruce Tanner.... Milwaukee Brewer General Manager Doug
Melvin interviewed Bob Melvin (no relation), the Arizona
Diamondbacks' bench coach, and Willie Randolph, the New York Yankees'
third base coach, to be the team's next manager.... The Montreal
Expos and put utility man and former Dodger Wilton Guerrero on
unconditional waivers.</TE>

<HD>Carew Has Finally Found His Fortress of Solitude</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the still of the morning, the distinguished gentleman walks into
the ballpark, in search of solitude and comfort.</LD>
<LD>   For so many years Rod Carew performed here, brilliance at bat.
When he comes to Edison Field these days, he comes alone. He walks
into a courtyard to a circle of flowers. Within it is a bronze bust
of a young woman.</LD>
<LD>   Here, Michelle Carew perpetually smiles. Here, a ballpark that can
hold 45,000 screaming fans becomes a sanctuary for one man. Here, Rod
Carew remembers the daughter he lost six years ago to leukemia, her
life cut short at 18.</LD>
<TE>   "I come out here a lot, by myself," Carew said. "Sometimes I just
sit and talk to her."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Carew returns to hear the cheers. For the first time
since his tenure as Angel batting coach ended in 1999, Carew will
attend a game at Edison Field, throwing out the ceremonial first
pitch before tonight's American League championship series game
between the Angels and the Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Few honors could be more fitting. Carew, a Hall of Famer and
seven-time batting champion, played all 19 seasons of his career for
the Twins and Angels. He is the only player to have his number
retired by both teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish," he said, "that both of them could win."</TE>
<TE>   After eight seasons as the Angel batting coach, and two more as
the Milwaukee Brewers' batting coach, Carew enjoyed a summer away
from the diamond this year. Although he lives in Orange County and
visits Edison Field for those few moments with his late daughter, he
did not care to attend any Angel games--for the same reason that he
stayed away after his playing career ended in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I get away from the game, I hide," he said. "I don't really
stay in touch with too many people. I have friends outside baseball
that are important to me. Those are the people I spend my time with.
I know they're always there for me."</TE>
<TE>   Carew said he is thrilled with the success of the Twins and Angels
and particularly pleased for some of the Angels he formerly coached.</TE>
<TE>   "Garret [Anderson] has been doing it for so many years, and he's
finally starting to get the recognition," Carew said. "I'm happy for
him. I'm happy for Timmy [Salmon]. I'm happy for Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy for the organization. I wish it could have happened
when Mr. Autry was here."</TE>
<TE>   While the Angels failed to win a postseason series until this
year, they won their first division championship in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   In the game that clinched the division title for the "Yes We Can"
Angels, the final out was a ground ball to first base, fielded by
Carew and flipped to pitcher Frank Tanana as fans stormed the field
at Anaheim Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a scary feeling," Carew said. "Everyone was standing.
It seemed like the whole stadium was closing in on us. Once I gave
him the ball, I just wanted to get out of there. I just wanted to
make sure I got off the field real quick."</TE>
<TE>   Carew continues to honor the promise he made to his daughter,
working with the Leukemia Society and the National Marrow Donor
Program in the search for a cure for leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   "No one remembers a bank account or what kind of house you live in
or what kind of car you drive," he said. "Making a difference in the
life of someone else, that's what's important."</TE>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>And then there was defenseman Kurt Sauer.</LD>
<LD>   Stanislav Chistov had a goal and three assists. Alexei Smirnov had
a goal and an assist. But Sauer, the third rookie in the lineup, was
just as important in the Mighty Ducks' 4-3 victory over the St. Louis
Blues Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Sauer, 21, is making the jump from juniors to the NHL seem like a
small step. He was teamed with veteran Keith Carney, and they battled
Doug Weight, Keith Tkachuk and Scott Mellanby--the Blues' top line.</LD>
<TE>   Said Coach Mike Babcock: "I said to my assistant coaches that
maybe tonight he will look his age.... [But] he went out there
playing big men and knocked them around."</TE>
<TE>   Sauer showed his composure in the second period, clearing a puck
under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the best play of the whole night," Babcock said. "He got
a bouncing puck. He has Mellanby coming one way and Tkachuk coming
the other.</TE>
<TE>   "He drew them in, flipped to his backhand and got the puck out of
there.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, no one does that."</TE>
<TE>   Sauer took 28 shifts, playing a team-high 23 minutes 5 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, there was a lot of nerves," Sauer said. "But after a couple
shifts, all you are doing is playing hockey."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Roy Williams Gets Honor</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Kansas coach will receive Wooden Legend
award. Midnight Madness starts tonight at USC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL McLEOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Athletic Club has selected Kansas basketball Coach
Roy Williams as recipient of this year's John R. Wooden Legends of
Coaching award.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement was made at an annual basketball tipoff luncheon
Thursday at the club's downtown headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   In a short note read to the crowd, Williams praised Wooden and
said that he was "flattered, humbled, yet ecstatic" to be honored.
Past recipients include Dean Smith of North Carolina, Mike Krzyzewski
of Duke, Lute Olson of Arizona and Denny Crum of Louisville.</LD>
<TE>   Optimism prevailed at the event, which showcased 13 Division I
men's teams from San Diego to San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby, a regular no-show, sent second-year
assistant Kurtis Townsend in his place. Legends of Coaching founder
Duke Llewellyn, a USC alumnus, said that he was disappointed because
Trojan administrators had assured him Bibby would make an appearance.</TE>
<TE>   But UCLA Coach Steve Lavin, noting that this is his seventh
consecutive appearance at the luncheon, said he doesn't blame Bibby.
Tongue planted firmly in cheek, Lavin said he comes to the meetings
only to see which of the other coaches at the head table is being
rumored to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year I come here, shake hands with these coaches, say
hello," Lavin said. "Then every one of them goes out and beats us."</TE>
<TE>   Other news of the day came from UC Riverside Coach John Masi, who
announced that three of his top players, including junior forward
Vili Morton, will redshirt this season.</TE>
<TE>   Masi wants to save them for when Riverside, which moved up from
Division II two years ago, becomes eligible to compete in the Big
West Conference tournament in 2004. Morton started 26 games last
season and averaged 10.9 points.</TE>
<TE>   Colleges can begin practicing Saturday and several, including USC,
are planning midnight starts. That won't be the case at UCLA, Lavin
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had Midnight Madness after we won the NCAA championship in
1994-1995," Lavin said. "Someone asked Coach Wooden what he thought
about it and he said. 'Well, it was madness.'</TE>
<TE>   "That was it. When the pope speaks, we listen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The USC men's and women's teams will play host to Midnight Madness
at the on-campus Lyon Center tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, who lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament
and have to replace three senior starters, return all-freshman
Pacific 10 Conference guard Errick Craven and junior guard Desmon
Farmer. The Women of Troy have junior All-America candidates in
forward Ebony Hoffman and guard Aisha Hollins.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for the event are $5, $3 for students, and can be
purchased at the USC ticket office or by calling (213) 740-4672.
Doors open at 11 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Injury to Keep Repent Out of Breeders' Cup</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Colt, who would have been one of the
favorites in Classic on Oct. 26, suffers apparent strained tendon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the spring, Repent's Kentucky Derby--and Triple Crown--plans were
scuttled by ankle surgery. Now, just when it appeared that the
3-year-old colt was going to salvage the season with a strong finish,
he has been knocked out of the Breeders' Cup Classic with another
injury.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a seventh-place finish in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at
Belmont Park on Sept. 28, Repent would have been one of the favorites
at Arlington Park on Oct. 26. But trainer Ken McPeek said Thursday
that Repent had come back from a gallop at Churchill Downs with what
appears to be a strained tendon, and the next running he'll do will
be as a 4-year-old, in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   McPeek's good news-bad news year is without a final chapter. Going
into April, he had two viable Derby horses--Repent and Harlan's
Holiday, the Florida Derby and Blue Grass winner--but Repent missed
Churchill Downs and Harlan's Holiday ran seventh as the Derby
favorite. Harlan's Holiday ran fourth in the Preakness and in early
June the colt's owners switched trainers.</LD>
<TE>   Then McPeek pulled a Belmont Stakes horse out of the hat, his
Sarava winning the Triple Crown finale at a record 70-1, but that
colt is also injured and out for the year. McPeek's remaining
Breeders' Cup hope is Take Charge Lady, who is likely to go off as
the second choice, behind Azeri, in the Distaff.</TE>
<TE>   Coming off a 4 1/2-month layoff, Repent rebounded from surgery in
late August, when he lost by only half a length to Medaglia d'Oro in
the Travers at Saratoga. McPeek had been puzzled when Repent, as the
17-10 favorite, ran so poorly in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. That was
the worst race for Repent, the Louisiana Derby winner whose record
had been dotted with firsts and seconds, including a strong second
against Johannesburg in last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile. McPeek
had been eager for the colt to redeem himself in the Kentucky Derby,
after War Emblem, the eventual Derby winner, upset Repent in the
Illinois Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Medaglia d'Oro, who hasn't run since the Travers and will go into
the Classic unraced for 61 days, is the lukewarm favorite for the
Breeders' Cup race, but this is a year when a case can be made for
more than half the field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Kalookan Queen won Saturday's Ancient Title Handicap at
Santa Anita, her trainer, Bruce Headley, was asked who might win if
the 6-year-old mare ran against Kona Gold, Headley's sprint champion
in 2000. It was intended as a hypothetical question, but a Kona
Gold-Kalookan Queen rematch will become a reality, now that Kalookan
Queen's owner, Louis Asistio, has told Headley that he wants to run
in the Breeders' Cup Sprint.</TE>
<TE>   Of the nine open Breeders' Cup races that have been won by females
over males, three have come in the Sprint: Very Subtle in 1987,
Safely Kept in 1990 and Desert Stormer in 1995. Last year, the filly
Xtra Heat came within a half-length of beating Squirtle Squirt in the
Sprint, and she'll be back for another try in a couple weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Kona Gold, after winning the Sprint in 2000, could do no better
than seventh last year. Headley thought that by running--and
finishing second--in the 2000 Ancient Title, Kona Gold was knocked
out coming back three weeks later in the Breeders' Cup. For that
reason, he withheld Kona Gold from Saturday's Ancient Title, and
after the race he cited the proximity of the Santa Anita race to the
Breeders' Cup as a reason not to send Kalookan Queen to Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Solis, who rode Kalookan Queen in the Ancient Title, will
stick with the 8-year-old Kona Gold in the Breeders' Cup and Mike
Smith, who has never ridden Kalookan Queen, will pick up the mount on
the mare at Arlington. Kona Gold's 1:07 3/5 time at Churchill Downs
two years ago is fastest ever for the Breeders' Cup Sprint. He will
become the first horse to run in five Breeders' Cup races.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, this was Headley's answer to that so-called
hypothetical: "It would be just like Kona running against the Pistol.
They'd both be there, and then you'd have to see who got the nod."</TE>
<TE>   Son Of A Pistol, who was still running when he was a 9-year-old,
was another of Headley's crack sprinters.</TE>
<TE>   He beat Kona Gold by a nose in the 2000 San Carlos Handicap at
Santa Anita.</TE>

<TE>   A Ransom, the quarter horse world champion in 2000 and undefeated
this year, will meet Tailor Fit, world champion in 1999 and 2001 and
winless this year, in the $200,000 Los Alamitos Invitational
Championship at the Orange County track Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   In a 10-horse field, the rivals have drawn adjoining posts. Tailor
Fit, who will be ridden by Bubba Brossette, will break from the No. 3
hole, just inside of A Ransom and Carlos Bautista. Runahalf and Royal
N Rowdy drew the two inside posts, and outside A Ransom, in order,
are All American Jewel, Rare Coup, Dashin Bye, Pure D Cool,
Whosleavingwho and Solar Dash.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of Saturday's 440-yard race qualifies for the Champion
of Champions race at Los Alamitos on Dec. 14.</TE>
<TE>   A Ransom has already qualified for the Champion of Champions with
his win in the Vessels Maturity on Aug. 10.</TE>

<LD>The Southern Section has contacted administrators at Moreno Valley
High regarding the eligibility of one of its top football players,
school and Moreno Valley Unified School District officials confirmed
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The inquiry centers on Chris Lopez, who transferred from Riverside
Notre Dame last winter. He threw the discus for the Vikings' track
and field team in the spring before joining the football squad this
season.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez, a Division I prospect as a 6-foot-2, 230-pound linebacker,
led Notre Dame with 138 tackles.</LD>
<TE>   "We have had some conversations with [officials] at the Southern
Section office," said Mark Sewell, dean of students at Moreno Valley.
"We're following the district's procedures regarding the behavior of
our athletic programs and making sure we follow all the right steps."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>

<TE>   Michael Poe of Etiwanda outkicked Erick Maldonado of Chino Don
Lugo to win the boys' sweepstakes race in the inaugural Inland Empire
Challenge cross-country meet last year, but he won't be running in
this year's edition of the meet at Guasti Regional Park in Ontario on
Saturday. Instead, he'll be taking the Scholastic Assessment Test at
Chaffey College.</TE>
<TE>   "You probably won't see me in any big races until the [Mt. San
Antonio College Invitational on Oct. 26]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Poe finished a disappointing--by his standards--15th in the
invitational seeded race of the Great American Cross-Country Festival
in Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 28 and tripped and fell near the mile
mark of the Division I race of the Yucaipa Invitational last
Saturday.</TE>

<TE>   Woodland Hills Taft receiver Steve Smith will play against San
Fernando in a nonleague game tonight after sitting out the last two
weeks with a sprained left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Starr, coach of the Toreadors, No. 8 in The Times' rankings,
said the senior has been practicing all week and that he was kept out
of the lineup to avoid further injury. Smith, last year's City
Section player of the year, hurt his ankle and sat out much of the
second half of a 39-0 victory over Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>

<TE>   Carson girls' tennis standouts Judith De Vera and Dianne Matias
have committed to USC, both players said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   De Vera, The Times' girls' player of the year last season, is the
defending City Section singles champion and led the Colts to two
consecutive team titles. Matias, in her first year at Carson, is No.
2 in Southern California in the U.S. Tennis Assn. girls' 18 rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's close to home, and some of the girls there, I've known for a
long time from junior tennis," Matias said.</TE>

<LD>Dan Desacola caught two touchdown passes and had a key interception
to lead Placentia Valencia to a 21-16 nonleague victory Thursday over
visiting Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   It is Valencia's second win in a row heading into next week's
Empire League opener against Anaheim Loara.</LD>
<LD>   Desacola caught five passes for 108 yards, including touchdown
receptions of 23 and 38 yards from Steve Lajkowicz. Desacola also
intercepted a fourth-quarter pass at the Irvine 32 to set up Rylon
Thomas' 26-yard run that gave the Tigers (3-2) a 21-10 lead with six
minutes to play.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine (3-2), which got a 26-yard field goal from Noe Santana in
the first quarter, took a 10-7 lead early in the third quarter when
Terrell Vinson scored from one yard. Vinson rushed 28 times for 119
yards, including an 83-yard score with 23 seconds left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Lajkowicz completed six of 11 passes for 133 yards, Jagger Thom
rushed eight times for 99 yards and Thomas had 17 carries for 71
yards for Valencia.</TE>

<TE>   Orange El Modena 42, Fullerton 6--Daniel Dixon rushed for 142
yards and three touchdowns and Jeff Mayes sparked the El Modena
defense with a 64-yard fumble return for a touchdown in a nonleague
game at El Modena.</TE>
<TE>   Mayes' touchdown gave the Vanguards (4-1) a 14-0 lead seven
minutes into the game and ended a jinx carried over from last season,
when he scored four touchdowns on offense, but all were nullified by
penalties. "All [penalties] on the same guy," Mayes said.</TE>
<TE>   El Modena (3-2) led, 28-0, at the half, holding Fullerton to just
four first downs. The Vanguards, who let two second-half leads slip
away against Santa Margarita and Santa Ana Foothill this season, held
Fullerton scoreless until two minutes remained in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We've come out slow in the second half a couple times," Mayes
said of the El Modena defense. "We've learned our lesson."</TE>

<LD>Three veteran geldings who have proven themselves down Santa Anita's
unique hillside course will be getting together in today's feature, a
$60,000 allowance at about 6 1/2 furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   F J's Pace, a five-time winner on the layout, four-time winner
Macward and Lookn East, who is batting .500 with two victories in
four tries, head the field of eight on a card spiced up by a two-day
pick six carryover of $289,934.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Ren-Mar Thoroughbreds and trained by Doug O'Neill, F J's
Pace won the Aprisa Handicap at Fairplex Park last month against only
three rivals as the 7-10 favorite. He is the speed of the field over
a course where he has won three of his last six starts.</LD>
<TE>   Macward, a 6-year-old Sharp Victor gelding co-owned by breeder
Marvin Malmuth and trained by Ian Jory, is making his first start
since he finished seventh in the nine-horse San Simeon Handicap on
April 21. Owned by Charles, Michael and Tom Dante and trained by
Vladimir Cerin, Lookn East is the 3-1 choice on the morning line on
the strength of his two-length win at Del Mar about a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   The five other participants are Lord Pacal, So Urgent, Capo Di
Capo, Star Cross, a six-time winner in his native Argentina and
Lebontempsroulet.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Danthebluegrassman is among nine 3-year-olds
entered in today's $75,000 Perryville at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Chad Schvaneveldt. The jockey has been making the best
of his opportunities at Bay Meadows, winning at about a 21% clip.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Caesar Bisono. The rider began Bay Meadows in a
three-for-63 slump.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Fragrant Cloud in the
second, using Hula Girl, Rainbow Acorn, R Bertrando, Little Q Tee and
Jade Vixen in the third and Belongstospeed, Quila Shun and Ec Lady in
the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/16. Money: Previous day/meet

<LD>Not that he was eager or anything, but Brad Norton was on a plane for
Los Angeles only hours after King General Manager Dave Taylor, on the
eve of training camp, interrupted the defenseman's dinner in Boston
to invite him to try out.</LD>
<LD>   Norton, 27, didn't have a contract and was a longshot to make the
Kings' roster, much less the roster of their American League team at
Manchester, N.H., but the Kings needed a big body in camp and Norton,
cut loose by the Florida Panthers in July, needed a job.</LD>
<LD>   He arrived at about 3 a.m. and set about making it difficult for
the Kings to turn him away. Norton, 6 feet 4 and 238 pounds, signed a
one-year, $450,000 contract Tuesday and made his King debut Wednesday
night.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a credit to him," Coach Andy Murray said. "It's not very
often that you come to camp without a contract as a free agent and
even get a contract to play in the American League, and here he is
playing in the NHL."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are glad to have him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one thing this club's been missing for a while, a
defenseman of his size and aggressiveness," said Mathieu Schneider,
who was paired with Norton in the 4-1 victory over the Phoenix
Coyotes. "If you have a guy like that in the lineup who can play a
regular shift, it makes it that much more difficult for the other
team.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a pretty physical defense, but we didn't have the
toughness where a guy was afraid to stand in front of our net because
he might get beat up."</TE>
<TE>   Norton, younger brother of NHL journeyman Jeff Norton, might not
stick around when Aaron Miller returns from the injured list, but
he's grateful for the chance.</TE>
<TE>   "It was risky, for sure," he said of his decision to come to camp
without a contract, "but I give these guys all the credit in the
world for giving me a fair shot to make the team and to prove
myself."</TE>

<LD>Dominant in the Bull Raustus Handicap a little over a month ago,
Sterling Sport will try for another victory tonight in the $37,100
Pat Hyland Memorial Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   A 5-year-old gelding owned by Muller Racing and trained by Dennis
Ekins, Sterling Sport went right to the front and extended his
advantage in the Bull Raustus. By the end of the 870 yards, the 11-1
longshot had 4 3/4 lengths on runner-up Butter Me Up CST.</LD>
<LD>   The victory, his seventh in 35 starts, came a month after his 19-1
surprise in the California Distance Challenge. The odds will be
considerably smaller on Sterling Sport tonight as he breaks from the
rail under regular jockey Gary Boag.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of the field includes Butter Me Up CST, Rock N Strawfly,
who has won four of his last five for trainer W.G. Baber, Azure
Classic Dash, A Cover Story and Reeking Havoc.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Sweetkins. 2. Tiki Arbi. 3. Topflyte. 4. Would She.
5. Zee Wayne. 6. Fashion Maven. 7. Rio Cheng. 8. Marmeta. 9. Sterling
Sport. 10. Ckh Sweetie Pie.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Mighty Advance Man and Rio Cheng in the seventh,
Marmeta, Granny Janny, Yak Ity Yak Go and Easy Winning Deal in the
eighth, single Sterling Sport in the ninth and Express Watch, Ckh
Sweetie Pie, Eg Special and Amover in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Dash Chantel makes against a soft field of
maidens in the first. Mi Gamboling Bug could rebound in the fifth
after a poor start last month.</TE>

<HD>Striking Appearance</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Milton's no-hitter against the outmanned Angels
late in the '99 season is considered a turning point in the fortunes
of the Twins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darin Erstad's most enduring memory of the no-hitter Minnesota Twin
left-hander Eric Milton threw against the Angels on Sept. 11, 1999,
wasn't Milton's last pitch of the game, a fastball he blew by Jeff
DaVanon for strike three. It was his first pitch.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember watching DaVanon swing for about 15 minutes in the
on-deck circle before the game," said Erstad, whose Angels will
oppose Milton and the Twins in Game 3 of the American League
championship series tonight at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   "Then, on his first swing against Milton, he almost fell over. I
don't think it would have mattered who played that day, because
Milton was lights out."</LD>
<TE>   Actually, it did matter who played that day. More precisely, it
mattered who didn't play.</TE>
<TE>   With the start of that Saturday game pushed to 11 a.m. to
accommodate a Minnesota-Louisiana Monroe football game in the
Metrodome that night, interim Angel Manager Joe Maddon went with a
starting lineup--DaVanon, Orlando Palmeiro, Todd Greene, Troy Glaus,
Steve Decker, Matt Luke, Bret Hemphill, Trent Durrington and Andy
Sheets--that looked more suited for a Cactus League split-squad game.</TE>
<TE>   This was the final month of a disastrous 70-92 season for the
Angels, one in which they were picked to win the American League
West, only to collapse amid a flurry of clubhouse bickering that got
Manager Terry Collins fired in early September and led to the
dismissal of General Manager Bill Bavasi later that month.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, free of the turmoil that consumed them in the final
days of Collins' tenure, won five of their first seven games under
Maddon, including a win over Minnesota ace Brad Radke on Friday
night, Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   With the early game time Saturday and a number of eager September
call-ups on the bench, Maddon thought it would be a good time to
start the kids en masse against Milton, a second-year big leaguer who
began the game with a 6-11 record.</TE>
<TE>   But a lineup that included five players who spent significant time
in the minor leagues that year and one who was hurt for most of the
season flailed away at Milton's less-than-baffling offerings, showing
little or no discipline at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Milton, relying almost exclusively on a fastball that topped out
at 92 mph, had 13 strikeouts, the most in his career. He walked two
and didn't give up anything close to a hit in the 7-0 victory. Milton
threw 18 first-pitch strikes and had seven 0-and-2 counts.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, not one Angel regular--Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon, Jim
Edmonds, Garret Anderson, Gary DiSarcina or Erstad--was asked to even
loosen up for a possible pinch-hit appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the regulars were in shut-down mode," Salmon said.
"Everybody on the bench was laughing and goofing around. We weren't
even in game mode."</TE>
<TE>   Some thought Milton's no-hitter should have come with an
asterisk--after all, it came against a lineup of no-hitters. But to
this day, Maddon, the Angel bench coach, has no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the right thing to do at the time," Maddon said during
Thursday's off-day workout. "It was a good time to get everyone
involved, but we ran into a hot pitcher that day. People have
different perceptions, but it was a developmental issue, and it
didn't work out. But if we had gotten one hit, would that have made a
difference? I don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   What Maddon couldn't have predicted at the time was how Milton's
no-hitter would galvanize the Twins. Like the Angels, Minnesota took
its lumps in 1999, going 63-97, but unlike the Angels, the low-budget
Twins lost with a group of kids who belonged in double-A and triple-A
and were being force-fed to the big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Though there was talent--in the lineup for Milton's no-hitter were
outfielders Torii Hunter and Jacque Jones, third baseman Corey Koskie
and first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz, who went on to become key
players for Minnesota's AL Central championship team this season--the
Twins were in far over their heads.</TE>
<TE>   They played before tiny home crowds, and what little national
recognition they received was negative; the focus was on their
$15-million payroll, the 17 rookies on the roster and their abysmal
play. "You're just trying to get through the season without anybody
getting killed," Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire, then the team's
third-base coach, recalled of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But Milton's no-hitter lent some legitimacy to their season. All
of a sudden, the Twins were the lead story on "SportsCenter," their
jubilant celebration with Milton replayed at the top of every sports
highlight show.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time something good was happening for us,"
Hunter said. "That was big. That was a major league moment.... That
was our start, right there."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins endured more growing pains in 2000, going 69-93, but
matured into division contenders in 2001 and champions in 2002. Many
point to Milton's no-hitter as providing the springboard to that
success.</TE>
<TE>   "When something special like that happens to a club, it seems like
it picks up the whole organization," Radke said. "That was 1999, and
it definitely picked us up. Most of these guys were just starting
out. They were just coming together then, so it helped. I definitely
think it helped out a lot of the younger guys."</TE>
<TE>   Especially Milton, who went from a promising pitcher in 1999 to
one of the game's best left-handers in 2002. Milton has gone 41-26
over the last three seasons and has a 5-2 record and 2.64 earned-run
average in nine starts against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "That did a lot for my confidence," Milton said of the no-hitter.
"That was right after I developed my slider. I had four pitches in
the arsenal and could go on from there."</TE>
<TE>   And off he went.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the best left-handers around," Erstad said. "He
throws 95 mph up in the zone, he has a great breaking ball and a
great arm angle on his fastball."</TE>

<HD>Pedregon Is Trying His Best to Force the Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bottom line: If the funny car results of the next three NHRA
events are the same as the last three, Tony Pedregon will unseat his
boss, John Force, as champion. He will end Force's drive for a 10th
consecutive title, put on hold a 12th championship and, for the first
time in a decade, cause the winningest driver in drag racing history
to say, "Wait till next year."</LD>
<LD>   "You can't stop destiny," said Force, winner of 104 national
events. "It is what it is."</LD>
<LD>   Pedregon, of Chino Hills, has won the last three races in a car
tuned by John Medlen and Dickie Venables. The longest elapsed time in
Pedregon's last 12 passes down the quarter-mile is 4.936 seconds.
There are 12 rounds of racing left, each worth 20 points. He is
within 18 points of Force, the closest anyone has been to Force this
late in the season since Pedregon's brother, Cruz, won the title in
1992. "It's one thing to catch him; it's another thing to go around
him," said Pedregon, in his seventh season as a driver for Force's
team. "The true test is going to come the next three races."</LD>
<TE>   Force doesn't figure to go down easy. Before Pedregon started his
winning streak, the Yorba Linda driver had won three straight. Bad
luck and mechanical gremlins have dogged him since, but he has been
awesome at the Texas Motorplex near Dallas, site of this weekend's
Fall Nationals. Force has been to the finals in 11 of his last 13
appearances there, and has won five times on the track's concrete
racing surface, four times in the Fall Nationals.</TE>
<TE>   "It would add to John's legacy, not that he needs anything else on
his resume," Pedregon said. "He's shooting for 12. I'd like one.
You've got two different guys wanting the same thing for different
reasons. That's the bottom line. When we get to the track, all the
talking, all the hype ... it's like boxers--nothing else matters but
knocking out the other guy.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, I'm staring at something right in the face,
and it's the Powerade championship. As much as I try to look away and
keep my focus, it's there. And it gives me goose bumps just thinking
about it. I know John likes a good fight, and now that I think about
it, I do too."</TE>
<TE>   It should be a scrap down to the wire for the two
Castrol-sponsored Ford Mustangs. They race in Las Vegas on Oct. 27,
and in the season-ending 38th Automobile Club of Southern California
Finals at Pomona Raceway on Nov. 10. And team orders won't be in
place to ensure that Force wins.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as it's me and Tony, we just race," Force said. "It's
that simple. It ain't like I'm going to lose my job if I don't win."</TE>
<TE>   Formula One</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Ecclestone, head of Formula One, has proposed a plan that
would handicap a car if it built an early points lead next season, as
Ferrari did this season en route to a 1-2 finish in this season's
standings, with Saturday's Japanese Grand Prix still to be run.
Michael Schumacher clinched the title in July.</TE>
<TE>   Under Ecclestone's proposal, the car leading the standings would
be weighted with 2.2 pounds of ballast for every point of its margin.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher and Ferrari teammate Rubens Barichello have won 14 of
16 races this season and manipulated the outcome twice. Ferrari, of
course, is against the scheme but isn't casting the only dissenting
opinion. Technical director Patrick Head of BMW Williams called the
idea "distasteful," and Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren's managing
director, said, "Nobody wants to beat Ferrari simply because their
cars carry additional weight."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, somebody does.</TE>
<TE>   "Bernie should go ahead," said team owner Eddie Jordan. The
Formula One Commission will debate the issue Oct. 28.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The field has been whittled to 15 in the Red Bull Driver Search
program to find American talent to run Formula One. Among the group
are seven Californians: A.J. Allmendinger of Hollister; Paul Edwards
of Santa Maria; Phil Giebler of Oxnard; Joey Hand of Sacramento;
Patrick Long of Oak Park; Rocky Moran Jr., of Coto de Caza; and Scott
Speed of Manteca. Others are Michael Abbate, Las Vegas; Ryan
Hunter-Reay, Boca Raton, Fla.; Grant Maiman, New London, Wis.; Joel
Nelson, Reno; Scott Poirer, Deerfield Beach, Fla.; Boston Reid,
Kokomo, Ind.; Bryan Sellers, Centerville, Ohio, and Bobby Wilson,
Oconomowoc, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   They range in age from 16 to 24, and begin intense five-day
testing in France on Oct. 15. Four will be financially backed by Red
Bull energy drink to race in European junior formula series.</TE>

<TE>   Orange County Speedway holds its U.S. National Championship on
Saturday, when Josh Larson will try to cap his dominating season with
his first national title. Larson, of Monrovia, won the regular-season
championship by 243 points over Shawn McConnell but he'll be in tough
company.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Hamill, who won the three-race AMA U.S. National
Championship series, joins seven other riders who have won Costa Mesa
Speedway national championships: Bart Bast (1998), Alan Christian
(1985), Mike Faria (1990, '91, '97), Chris Manchester (1992, 2001),
Brad Oxley (1987, '99), Bobby Schwartz (1986, '89), and Charlie
Venegas (2000).</TE>

<TE>   Supercross and U.S. motocross champion Ricky Carmichael of Team
Honda takes aim tonight and Saturday at the $300,000 THQ United
States Open at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Carmichael,
who won all 24 motos in the outdoor season en route to a 12-race
sweep of the series, is trying to become the event's first three-time
champion. It would also give him Supercross, motocross and U.S. Open
titles in consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really important to me, not only to keep the streak going,
but to win the event three times in a row would be phenomenal," said
Carmichael, who has a 15-race winning streak. Jeremy McGrath, David
Vuillemin, Ezra Lusk and Tim Ferry are among those trying to end
Carmichael's reign.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Five classes will be racing Saturday night at Perris Auto
Speedway, including California cruisers and dwarf cars. Titles are
yet to be decided in super stocks, street stocks and California champ
trucks. Super stock driver John Caley holds a two-point lead over
fellow Riverside driver Chad Burns with three races remaining. George
Bouldin of Elsinore has a 10-point lead over Henry Wesoloski Sr.,
with two races left in street stocks. Also with two races left,
Cathedral City's Art Peterson holds a two-point lead over Mike Hixson
of Murrieta, and four-point lead over Dino Napier of Corona, in champ
trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale Speedway crowned three track champions over the weekend,
Ricky Wildman of Wildomar in the legend cars, Carson Woods III of
Yucca Valley in ultra wheels super trucks, and Rip Michels of Mission
Hills in the super late model Big 10 Challenge. Wildman, 17, became
Irwindale's youngest track champion.... The late model driver who
finishes best in Saturday's race at Irwindale and the Oct. 20 event
at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield will win the newly dubbed
"California state late model championship" and a $1,000 cash
bonus.... The Figure 8 champion will be crowned Saturday at
Irwindale. James Altman leads Steve Stewart and Tom Smith by 18
points.... The third Mayor's Cup Challenge will be held at the
Irwindale drag strip Saturday, 4-5 p.m. Local civic leaders will be
competing in specially prepared Ford Focus ZX-5s. Admission is free.</TE>
<TE>   National records were set in the junior fuel class as Dean Carter
of Glendale ran the quickest and fastest quarter-mile in the class'
history--7.114 seconds, 188.28 mph--at the 11th NHRA National Hot Rod
Reunion in Bakersfield. In the premier event, Jack Harris of
Kayville, Utah, won the top fuel A final at 6.124 seconds and 216.24
mph.... Winston Cup driver Dale Jarrett appears Tuesday, 1-3 p.m., at
the California RV Show at the Fairplex in Pomona.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Fisher was going to be an accountant. He was going to grow old
in Little Rock, Ark., among people he knew. He was going to eat
Southern food in their restaurant on Saturday night and pray in their
church on Sunday morning and maybe play some basketball on their
playground on Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Then, he was going to spend the next five days as an accountant,
doing their taxes or their books or whatever.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing too fancy," Fisher said Thursday afternoon with a smile.</LD>
<TE>   After six NBA seasons and three championship rings, Fisher returns
to Little Rock for an exhibition game tonight.</TE>
<TE>   He played at Parkview High and Arkansas Little Rock. He worked at
an accounting firm on the north side of town for much of two years.
His family and friends and acquaintances will help fill Alltel Arena
for the game against the Memphis Grizzlies, the team from across the
river.</TE>
<TE>   There will be the usual uproar over the Lakers and their traveling
party of superstars, and for the local Grizzlies, but some of it will
be for Derek Fisher, the quiet guard from up the street.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be a surreal experience," he said. "To think where I was
then, leaving school...."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher shook his head and grinned. It is where he learned the
game, where he learned values that make him so charitable in the
community, and particularly with children. He guessed that as many as
10,000 of the 17,000 in the building would have at least a loose
connection with him, from his mother to his aunt to his English
teacher to his high school coach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a preseason game," he said. "But there will be some extra
emotion in it for me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have decided not to play exhibition games in Japan next
fall, though they probably will return to Hawaii for training
camp.... Mark Madsen has a strained left hamstring and probably will
not play this weekend.... Rick Fox (strained lower back) also is
questionable.... Tracy Murray (sore right hip) practiced Thursday
after sitting out Wednesday.... Shaquille O'Neal is on the three-day
trip through Little Rock and Oklahoma City.</TE>

<TE>   The Clippers dressed only 10 players for their exhibition at
Portland, Ore., on Thursday night, and the Trail Blazers routed them,
99-75.</TE>
<TE>   Center Michael Olowokandi, power forward Elton Brand and guard
Quentin Richardson were among those who couldn't play because of
various injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, who play the Seattle SuperSonics tonight at Staples
Center, were led by Corey Maggette's 17 points and seven rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This could be the season Eric Piatkowski finally loses his
starting spot as the Clippers' shooting guard. This could be the
season Piatkowski, at long last, is sent to the bench by younger,
more talented, more promising players.</TE>
<TE>   But don't bet on it.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski said he is having the best training camp of his nine
NBA seasons--all with the Clippers. He said he loves playing with
point guard Andre Miller, acquired during the off-season in a trade
with the Cleveland Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   If his 14-point performance--on five-of-eight shooting--in 28
minutes in the Clippers' exhibition victory Tuesday over the Lakers
is any indication, Piatkowski might just hang onto his starting
position. Richardson, nursing a sprained right knee, might remain in
his role as the Clippers' first substitute.</TE>
<TE>   "I want Pike to shoot every open shot he has," Coach Alvin Gentry
said. "We're not sticking him out there to lead the team in assists."</TE>
<TE>   With Miller delivering the ball with pinpoint accuracy, Piatkowski
has been getting plenty of open shots--more than previously, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just know that, when I compare this training camp to the last
one, I'm getting a ton of wide open looks," said Piatkowski, who set
a team record by making 111 of 238 three-point shots (46.6%) last
season. "I'm getting guarded by the same guys as last year. I'm
finding a spot and [Miller and backup Marko Jaric] are getting me the
ball."</TE>

<TE>   China has dropped center Wang Zhizhi from its national basketball
team because he wants to play in the NBA, rather than in the Asian
Games.</TE>
<TE>   Wang, who played last season for Dallas but signed an offer sheet
with the Clippers last week, has shown an "absence of professional
standards, indiscipline and indifference to the interests of the
nation," according to a statement by the China Basketball Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, in the midst of a 15-day period during which Wang
can re-sign with the Mavericks, had no comment.</TE>

<TE>   Denver Nugget center Marcus Camby, who sat out his final 38 games
with the New York Knicks last season because of a torn muscle in his

The Washington Wizards are considering signing forward Charles
Oakley. ... The NBA players union filed a grievance over the record
$250,000 fine the Knicks gave Latrell Sprewell for failing to
promptly tell the team about his hand injury. It will probably be at
least two months before the grievance arbitrator makes a decision.</TE>

<HD>NCAA's New President Is Already a Brand Name</HD>
<DH>College sports: Indiana president, who fired Knight, is
given a five-year contract to replace Dempsey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Myles Brand, the man who fired legendary Indiana basketball coach Bob
Knight, accepted a similarly daunting challenge Thursday when he was
named NCAA president-elect and chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   Brand, the 60-year-old president of Indiana University, received a
five-year contract. He will replace retiring eight-year NCAA
president Cedric Dempsey on Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's an important statement to choose a sitting
[university] president; it shows intercollegiate athletics are
integral to higher education and the two are woven together," Brand
said.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Lawless, the University of Tulsa president and chairman
of the NCAA executive committee that unanimously chose Brand over two
other finalists, one of whom was a minority, said "stressing the
education component of athletics" was a critical factor in Brand's
favor.</TE>
<TE>   Lawless refused to reveal the identity of the other two finalists
and wouldn't identify the value of Brand's contract. Dempsey's
contract was worth an estimated $755,000, but the NCAA wanted his
replacement to earn less.</TE>
<TE>   "We selected Myles Brand principally because what we were seeking
was leadership," Lawless said.</TE>
<TE>   Brand said his first priority is to listen to all
constituencies--chancellors/presidents, athletic department
officials, athletes--regarding NCAA-related issues, and to
subsequently formulate a strategic process to pursue effective
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Among the issues confronting the NCAA:</TE>
<TE>   * Academic reforms that include calls for an increase in high
school core courses and qualifying entrance scores, increased
graduation rates and incentives or penalties for team grades.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial aid for athletes in an era when Dempsey has presided
over a $6.2-billion basketball television deal with CBS and ESPN,
football and basketball coaches are garnering million-dollar
contracts and programs are enjoying multi-million-dollar sponsorship
deals.</TE>
<TE>   * Diversity in coaching.</TE>
<TE>   * Athletic budgets. Dempsey said only 30 of 124 Division 1-A
universities are generating more revenue than they're spending.</TE>
<TE>   "One great strength [Brand] will have is that the people who hired
him want to make him successful," Dempsey said. "He will have strong
support in pushing his agenda along."</TE>
<TE>   Dick Schultz, the NCAA executive director from 1988-93, said
Brand's reputation from the Knight scandal at Indiana probably seized
the executive committee's attention.</TE>
<TE>   "As president of the NCAA, the biggest authority you have is in
the position itself, to convince people to exact change," Schultz
said. "I'm sure the committee was impressed with his leadership
skills, intelligence and ability to get the job done."</TE>
<TE>   Brand didn't yield to the intimidating Knight during their
immensely public showdown two years ago. Brand first instituted a
zero-tolerance policy against Knight in May 2000 after Indiana's
board of trustees conducted an investigation into the behavior of the
Hoosiers' 29-year coach, with 763 wins and three national
championships. On September 7, 2000, Knight was accused of grabbing
and cursing at an Indiana freshman who had informally greeted him,
"Hey, what's up, Knight?" Three days later, Brand fired Knight for "a
persistent and troubling pattern of behavior."</TE>
<TE>   When Indiana advanced to the Final Four in March, Hoosier Coach
Mike Davis carried the game ball into the stands and presented it to
Brand.</TE>
<TE>   Brand contended the importance of his past with Knight had minimal
impact on his hiring. "There was no discussion of it at all in our
final interview, not one question," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lawless: "The way he handled it showed Myles' ability to make
decisions and build a consensus, but there were many other things in
Myles' past that we considered."</TE>
<TE>   Randy Farley, associate director of media relations for basketball
at Texas Tech, where Knight now coaches, said Knight was "out of town
and working," and unavailable for comment.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New coach. New goalie. No captain.</LD>
<LD>   Same Red Wings.</LD>
<LD>   Kirk Maltby scored two short-handed goals in the first 7:05, and
Curtis Joseph made 23 saves to win his Detroit debut Thursday night
as the Stanley Cup champions opened with a 6-3 road victory over the
San Jose Sharks.</LD>
<TE>   Sergei Fedorov also scored two goals for the Red Wings, who were
without injured captain Steve Yzerman and delivered an easy victory
for new Coach Dave Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Tomas Holmstrom and Nicklas Lidstrom also scored as the Red Wings
ripped San Jose goalie Miikka Kiprusoff for six goals in 15 shots in
the first two periods.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph bolted from Toronto in hopes of winning a title as the
replacement for retired Dominik Hasek. Wearing his customary
rabid-dog mask--in red instead of Maple Leafs blue now--Joseph was
mostly solid, with a stunning point-blank stop of Todd Harvey late in
the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Damphousse had two goals and an assist, and captain Owen
Nolan had three assists for the Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Pittsburgh 0--Alexander Mogilny and Mats Sundin each
scored twice, and Ed Belfour had a shutout in his first start for the
Maple Leafs in a victory at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   It was the worst opening-game loss in the Penguins' 35-year
history.</TE>
<TE>   Darcy Tucker set up the first four goals, and both Mogilny and
Sundin had four-point games.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 2, Chicago 1--Rick Nash, the first player selected in the
NHL draft, scored on his second shot as the Blue Jackets won at
Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Sillinger had a goal and an assist, and Marc Denis stopped 31
shots, including several in the last two minutes when the Blackhawks
applied steady pressure on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 2, Ottawa 1--John Madden scored twice, and Martin
Brodeur came within 1:14 of a shutout as the Devils won at Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   Brodeur made 33 saves, losing his shutout on Ottawa's 32nd shot,
when Daniel Alfredsson tipped in Petr Schastlivy's shot.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 5, New York Islanders 1--Chris Gratton and J.P. Dumont had
a goal and an assist each as the Sabres won at Buffalo, N.Y. Gratton,
with the third opening-night goal of his career, and newcomer Jochen
Hecht scored 1:31 apart late in the period to put Buffalo ahead 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Florida 3--Vaclav Prospal pounced on a loose puck and
shot it past goalie Roberto Luongo at 3:34 of overtime to lift the
Lightning past the Panthers at Sunrise, Fla. Brad Richards, Brad
Lukowich and Vincent Lecavlier also scored for the Lightning.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, Edmonton 2--John LeClair scored twice, but the
Oilers rallied with two goals late in the third period to tie the
Flyers at Edmonton, Canada. Anson Carter evened the score with a
power-play goal at 16:23 of the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 3, Calgary 0--Dan Cloutier made 19 saves as the Canucks
won at Calgary, Canada. Brendan Morrison, Bryan Allen and Markus
Naslund scored first-period goals for the Canucks.</TE>

<KH>GIANT-CARDINAL REPORT</KH>
<HD>La Russa and Baker Are Fined</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Managers Tony La Russa of the St. Louis Cardinals and Dusty Baker of
the San Francisco Giants were each fined by the commissioner's office
Thursday for their part in Wednesday's near brawl during Game 1 of
the National League championship series.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt like the two managers did not exhibit control over
themselves or their ballclubs," said Bob Watson, the baseball
official in charge of discipline. "You had two managers pushing over
the umps to get at each other. That's not what managers should do in
that situation."</LD>
<LD>   The undisclosed fine is thought to be between $500 and $1,000.</LD>
<TE>   "I think Lofton should pay the fines for both Dusty and myself,"
said La Russa.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Lofton, the Giants' center fielder, hit a home run off
Cardinal starter Matt Morris in the third inning, then took
exception to an inside pitch thrown by Cardinal right-hander Mike
Crudale in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton yelled at Crudale, then turned his anger on Mike Matheny
when the St. Louis catcher became involved in the heated discussion.
Both dugouts quickly emptied.</TE>
<TE>   Watson also announced Thursday that all non-active players,
permitted in the dugout for Game 1, would not be allowed to be in
uniform for Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the decision [is proper]," La Russa said. "They were told
they could not participate.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody broke the rules. They went out there, they did
something wrong and they got punished."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although he kept saying the incident was history, La Russa
couldn't seem to help himself as he kept criticizing Lofton Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of those guys that makes a big to-do about the ball
inside," La Russa said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can check my record. I bet you rarely ever hear me talk about
the opponents' players. Never. Hardly ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I concentrate on the team that I'm with, but this was pretty
flagrant."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the two teams faced off Wednesday, one of the Cardinals on
the front line was third baseman Scott Rolen,  who may not even play
in this series because of a sprained left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he thought about his injured player taking a fighting
stance, La Russa admitted he hadn't realized Rolen  had been out
there.</TE>
<TE>   Then the St. Louis manager rolled his eyes at the mere thought of
it.</TE>

<LD>One of the things that I have noticed about experiencing the sea is
that nothing lasts. There is always a level of your current
experience, which seems more intense than what you have been exposed
to in the past. In other words, good things never last, bad things
will always change to good, and there is always someone out there who
has experienced more wind, a bigger wave or a colder day.</LD>
<LD>   --Brad Van Liew, sailor</LD>
<LD>   In two days, when many of us are settling onto the couch to watch
football or baseball, Brad Van Liew will be setting sail from Torbay,
England, to Cape Town, South Africa.</LD>
<TE>   His trip, the second leg of the Around Alone sailing race, will
cover 6,880 nautical miles. If all goes well, he will sail into port
sometime before Thanksgiving weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "By then, the Trojans ought to be right in the thick of things,"
the USC graduate said during a phone interview.</TE>
<TE>   By then, how his alma mater is faring will be one of the last
things on his mind. He and the 12 other skippers competing in the
race will have long since put such trivial interests behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Their only concerns will be resting and preparing for the third
leg, then the fourth and fifth. With luck--and it'll take some
luck--all 13 will complete the circumnavigation of the world and will
sail into Newport, R.I., next April.</TE>
<TE>   This is the sixth running of the Around Alone, a single-handed
competition held every four years. In the previous five, only 56 of
87 sailors made it to the finish line. Most who didn't suffered
equipment failure or fatigue. Six were forced to abandon their
vessels and, fortunately, were rescued. One ran aground and lost his
boat, one fell overboard and was never found, another mysteriously
disappeared along with his vessel.</TE>
<TE>   As for Van Liew, 34, a Mount Pleasant, S.C., resident who grew up
in Southern California, he finished third in his class the last time
the race was held, in 1998-99. Afterward, he needed back
surgery--twice.</TE>
<TE>   Why go through such an arduous struggle again?</TE>
<TE>   "The last time, I was just hoping to finish," he said. "This time,
I want to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The passage at the top of this column was taken from Van Liew's
log Sept. 28, a day he spent crashing through the North Atlantic in
the face of 30- to 40-knot headwinds, in the late stages of the first
leg from New York to Torbay.</TE>
<TE>   Van Liew had made astounding progress early on, using a steady
tailwind to build a huge lead. The 50-foot Tommy Hilfiger Freedom
America has been called a hot rod. It has a wide beam, a thin
carbon-fiber hull and other lightweight and somewhat experimental
components. It streaks along smoothly--and remarkably
quickly--downwind, but takes a beating when traveling upwind.</TE>
<TE>   For five consecutive days, Van Liew sailed upwind. He couldn't
sleep. The pinging sound of his hull slamming repeatedly onto the
ocean was deafening.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like living in a tin drum," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He wondered how long the boat could weather such a pounding. But
eventually the wind eased and, on the morning of Sept. 30, Freedom
America glided peacefully across the finish line at Torbay, more than
600 miles and nearly three days ahead of his closest competitor in
Class II, vessels 40 to 50 feet.</TE>
<TE>   His time of 14 days 16 hours 56 minutes 49 seconds was even better
than one of the larger and supposedly faster vessels in Class I,
50-60 feet. Bernard Stamm of Switzerland was the swiftest of that
bunch, setting a solo trans-Atlantic monohull record aboard the Bobst
Group-Armor Lux, with a time of 10:22:48:38.</TE>
<TE>   There is the obvious reward for being the fastest during any of
the five legs--each small victory brings the sailors one step closer
to an overall victory. But doing so also buys time with family and
friends before the start of the next leg.</TE>
<TE>   When Van Liew sailed into Torbay, his wife, Meaghan, and
6-month-old daughter, Tate Magellan, were there to greet him. They'll
see him off Sunday and will accompany him in spirit during the long
haul to Cape Town.</TE>
<TE>   "They're what keeps me going," Van Liew said. "My wife will e-mail
photographs of our daughter and that'll help keep my spirits up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That there are only 13 sailors this year points to the nature of
the race. The routes are long and the seas treacherous. Although they
have the support of their teams, the sailors, by and large, are on
their own in a vast and often turbulent world.</TE>
<TE>   "You never get used to it," Van Liew said. "There's really no way
to prepare for the mental anguish that goes along with so much
solitude."</TE>
<TE>   This year's race has one female sailor, England's Emma Richards,
27, who skippered the Pindar to a fourth-place finish--out of seven
boats in Class I--during the first leg. It also has a diabetic,
Canada's John Dennis, 57, who piloted the Bayer Ascensia to a
fourth-place finish in Class II.</TE>
<TE>   This 28,000-mile race will be tougher than any of their previous
journeys. And therein, most likely, lies the attraction. To simply
finish this race is an achievement. To do well is a bonus, and to
win, even though there is no cash prize, is the ultimate
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "The better we can do, the better we make ourselves feel," said
Van Liew, the only sailor in the field who finished the 1998-99 race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Because their vessels require nearly constant attention if they're
to run at optimum speed, the sailors will be depriving themselves of
precious sleep for nearly all of the waterborne portions of their
seven-month excursion.</TE>
<TE>   Van Liew has his daily regimen down to a science. He will sleep an
average of 4 1/2 hours a day in "mini-naps" averaging 26 minutes.
Breakfast is cereal and coffee. Lunch is an energy bar or two and
dinner is dehydrated meat over rice or pasta.</TE>
<TE>   Since a light boat is a faster boat, the inventory is small.
Sailors have been known to cut toothbrushes in half and tear the
covers off books to keep weight down.</TE>
<TE>   Van Liew will carry only 26 pounds of food for every 30-40 days.
He'll burn 5,000 calories a day and lose several pounds a week.</TE>
<TE>   The voyage is just as taxing mentally. Van Liew's philosophy is
that each day he puts behind him brings him that much closer to his
objective--and to the warm embraces of family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that the longer you're out there by yourself, the
more survivalish it becomes," he said. "When I first leave, I really
miss hanging out and enjoying a glass of wine or a beer with friends.
And by the end I find myself latching onto what little things I have
that are tied to my lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   They include "a splash of wine" every few days with dinner,
listening to music, reading a book and, of course, watching Tate
Magellan come to life on the computer screen.</TE>
<TE>   News and Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Hunting: Thousands of deer hunters who long ago had purchased
tags to hunt this month in several zones within the Angeles, San
Bernardino and Cleveland national forests are among those being kept
out because of closures designed to minimize the threat of fires. The
zones affected are D11, D14, D15, D16 and D19. The Department of Fish
and Game is offering no refunds but is offering--until Tuesday--to
exchange the tags for tags good in zones not affected by closures.
The DFG and hunters have been highly critical of the U.S. Forest
Service and the lack of adequate notice given them.</TE>
<TE>   * Saltwater fishing: Pacific Queen skipper Bill Cavanaugh reports
"some of the most phenomenal albacore fishing I have ever seen" off
Morro Bay. He was referring primarily to Monday's bite, during which
22 anglers boated 251 tuna averaging 30-40 pounds. "The fish were
biting full-speed for 2 1/2 hours," he said. "Words can't describe
it." The vessel has moved from its San Diego port and can be reached
at (858) 483-8990.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, yellowtail are making the biggest splash. The
Toronado out of Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach on Thursday had 108
on its deck at Tanner Bank. Some of the fish topped 30 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   * Scuba diving: Skin Diver magazine, which for the last 50 years
has been bringing the underwater world to life, closed its doors
Wednesday. Citing financial reasons, Primedia pulled the plug on a
monthly magazine that boasted a circulation of more than 200,000. The
November issue, now in print, will be the last.</TE>
<TE>   * RV Show: The 50th annual California RV Show begins a 10-day run
today at Fairplex in Pomona. Free prostate cancer screenings will be
offered to men 40 and older. Show admission is $6, $5 for seniors and
free for children under 12. Hours are 10 a.m.-6 p.m. daily. Details:

<DH>Long Beach Poly is a football and academic power, but low
scores on SAT by some college recruits show it can be a difficult
balance</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Snide comments and cynical glances--Manuel Wright knows what some
people at his former high school, including some teachers, think of
him.</LD>
<LD>   "Just a dumb football player," he said.</LD>
<LD>   The big, talkative defensive lineman was a decent student at Long
Beach Poly High but is among several athletes who, in recent years,
received scholarship offers from major universities only to fall
short of NCAA admissions standards because of low test scores.</LD>
<TE>   Many of the players were headed for USC and local media chronicled
their difficulties, raising concern at their alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   Poly enjoys an otherwise impressive academic reputation, so alumni
complained about the negative publicity. Administrators sympathized
with the players while, in the next breath, worrying their campus
might be regarded as a "factory" churning out cornerbacks, not
scholars.</TE>
<TE>   "Athletics are so high profile and that's what draws the
headlines," co-principal Shawn Ashley said. "You're talking about
four or five guys among 1,000 graduates and people will base their
whole perception of Poly on those four or five guys."</TE>
<TE>   The fallout has effected young men already worried about keeping
their college football dreams alive. Saturday, as Poly faces the
nation's top-ranked team, Concord De La Salle, Wright will confront
an equally daunting challenge, hunkering down with pencil in hand for
another try at the Scholastic Assessment Test.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody around the school knows," he said. "I have something to
prove."</TE>
<TE>   It is common for young athletes such as Wright, who graduated last
year, to struggle with the SAT. As Poly head counselor Michael Gray
said: "There are students who pass their classes but this test comes
along and trips them up." With the media, especially some Web sites,
focused on recruiting, these cases are often reported.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the dilemma at Poly stems from the Jackrabbits' winning:
The football team has a 66-2-1 record and four sectional
championships in five seasons. This success makes the school
vulnerable to an age-old stereotype that athletic "powerhouses"
sacrifice classwork for victories.</TE>
<TE>   The Brookings Institution examined this belief in its Brown Center
Report on American Education, asking the question: "How seriously do
sports distract American high schools from their academic mission?"</TE>
<TE>   Released last month, the study identified 141 schools that excel
in football, baseball and basketball, then scrutinized their results
from state-required math and reading tests. The report stated:
"Powerhouse high schools score about the same as nonpowerhouses."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers suggested that some traits valuable in
sports--ambition, confidence, leadership--also make for good
students.</TE>
<TE>   At Poly, administrators have other statistics to bolster their
academic standing. The school scores well in the state's Academic
Performance Index, earning the highest rank among California schools
with similar student bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Football players feel pressure to keep up in class, said Darrell
Rideaux, a 1999 graduate who starts at cornerback for USC.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't matter if I was an athlete," said Rideaux, who was
enrolled in the Center for International Commerce, a Poly magnet that
focuses on a variety of subjects with a global emphasis. "I've got a
3.4 grade-point average, but the guy on my left had a 3.8 and the guy
on my right had a 3.9."</TE>
<TE>   The players of that era formed a makeshift committee "to make sure
everyone was in class, taking care of business," said Chris Lewis, a
quarterback at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   They were not pleased by news about Poly athletes struggling to
qualify for college.</TE>
<TE>   "We have guys who are not living up to our standards," Rideaux
said. "When we lose four guys in two years, we've got to put our foot
down."</TE>
<TE>   Poly administrators try to help. They track gifted athletes early
on, advising them about college requirements. Players also can attend
an alternative campus where classes are smaller and move quickly. The
program is accredited but has been criticized by outsiders who wonder
if it is a way of easing athletes through the system.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley, the co-principal, believes that if a student is talented
enough to attract a scholarship, "we need to do everything we can to
get them to college."</TE>
<TE>   Outside help comes from the Princeton Review, a company that
offers test preparation courses and admissions assistance. Poly
football players get help for free as part of a nationwide program to
help athletes at urban schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We make an awful lot of money from the wealthy communities in
Long Beach so we don't have much trouble giving something back," said
Paul Kanarek, president of the Princeton Review in Orange County.
"Clearly the most successful program we have is with the Long Beach
Poly football players."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA tight end Marcedes Lewis and USC wide receiver Kareem Kelly
qualified with Kanarek's help. USC tailback Hershel Dennis earned the
score he needed after several attempts. "Every single day he worked
hard and he made it," Kanarek said.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis said: "They were real strict at Poly, making sure we were
in class, and they gave us a lot of help."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, for all the success stories--and players such as Rideaux and
Lewis who needed no help--there are the recent failures. Four players
headed to USC did not qualify: Wright and Darnell Bing this year,
Marvin Simmons and Raymond Tago in 2001. Raymond Washington, now at
Fresno State, and Kim Taylor, at Washington, were also nonqualifers.</TE>
<TE>   One of the players, who asked not to be named, sounded frustrated
when he said: "At Poly, we have a high academic reputation, but why
aren't all these guys passing the test? We seem to be excelling in
everything but the SAT."</TE>
<TE>   Ashley posed a different question: "Why are we surprised that some
kids aren't ready for college? Obviously the NCAA set these standards
because they are saying not everybody is college material."</TE>
<TE>   Even Kanarek, in the business of helping students qualify, agrees.
"Some just don't have the ability or they don't work hard enough."</TE>
<TE>   Nonqualifiers can accept a scholarship from a lower-division
school with lower admission standards or attend community college and
earn their way into Division I with a two-year degree. Ashley advises
them of these options.</TE>
<TE>   "They can see the test scores, they can see the grades ... for
them to be surprised, I don't know what they are thinking," the
co-principal said. He added: "It's really not our mission to supply
USC with all the football players they can handle."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll, whose roster includes several Poly alumni,
denied any ill feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel bad for the kids," he said. "Hopefully it will all
work out for them."</TE>
<TE>   This fall, with Poly unbeaten and USC nationally ranked, Simmons
says he is weeks away from earning his degree from Compton College. A
sometime visitor to Trojan practices--his older brother, Melvin, is a
starting linebacker--he hopes to enroll in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the younger guys on the Poly squad have learned from the
guys who went before," he said. "We're being used as an example of
what not to do."</TE>
<TE>   Wright and Bing also can enroll soon if they score high enough on
Saturday's SAT.</TE>
<TE>   For Wright, the quest is personal.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't quit here," he said. "I have to keep pursuing my dream."</TE>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Say this in a whisper.</LD>
<LD>   "The I-5 World Series. It's coming."</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants beat St. Louis, 4-1, Thursday night to
take a 2-0 lead in the National League championship series and come
home to Pac Bell Park for the next three games.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels split the first two games with the Twins at the
Metrodome in the American League championship series and are home for
the next three games.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels took three in a row from the Yankees last week. Is it
too much to expect them to do the same against the Twins?</TE>
<TE>   It's too soon to think that the St. Louis Cardinals will lose to
the Giants, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   A night after Kenny Lofton caused a nice near-brawl with his anger
over an inside pitch, Rich Aurilia hit two homers and accounted for
three of the Giants' four runs.</TE>
<TE>   His first homer came in the first inning and seemed to suck the
air right out of Busch Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   It's too soon to promo the "All Wild Card, All The Time" World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   It's too soon to expect the Angels to continue pounding doubles
and triples against all comers.</TE>
<TE>   It's too optimistic to think that the weak outing against Twins'
pitcher Joe Mays was just an aberration and that the Angels will keep
hitting against Minnesota the same as they did against the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   It's too soon to imagine Bonds twirling his bat in Edison Field,
facing Troy Percival in the ninth, Angels ahead by one.</TE>
<TE>   It's too quick to give up on the Cardinals, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Finley pitches next for St. Louis and how badly Finley must
want to get to the World Series and face so many of his old
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   It's too much to think the Giants will keep doing everything
right.</TE>
<TE>   They've been doing everything right all September. They never gave
the Dodgers a chance to breathe, a minute to hope. They latched on to
the wild-card spot and just kept winning.</TE>
<TE>   Walk Barry Bonds? Fine. Benito Santiago will knock in the runs. Or
Aurilia will do it first. He has 11 RBIs in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like the Cardinals are beaten. Manager Tony La Russa
kept saying "I don't know how he did it, pitching so well after all
that time off. My guy did great. He really, really pitched well."</TE>
<TE>   La Russa was referring to Woody Williams, his starter. Williams
pitched twice in July, once in August and four times in September
while struggling with a strained oblique muscle. He hadn't pitched
since Sept. 20 and when Aurilia cracked a ball over the wall as the
second batter faced by Williams, it seemed like a long night for the
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   And it was, but not because of Williams.</TE>
<TE>   It's because the Cardinals don't have enough hitting. Not as much
as the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   It's because the Cardinals don't have enough nerve. Not as much as
Giant Manager Dusty Baker, who tried a squeeze play Thursday. "That
was big," Aurilia said.</TE>
<TE>   It's too far-fetched to think that California will own the World
Series, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   The Giants and Angels have been competing under playoff pressure
since August. Every at-bat,  every pitch, mattered. So October is
nothing different, just more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins, they coasted in. The Cards, they sauntered in.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves and the Yankees weren't tough enough to break the
Giants and Angels.</TE>
<TE>   But it must be too early to think the Cards and Twins aren't tough
enough either.</TE>
<TE>   Is it greedy to hope?</TE>
<TE>   California had the best of the NBA playoffs. Lakers-Kings won't be
topped for a long time and who even remembers Lakers-Nets?</TE>
<TE>   It's almost unfair to long for Giants-Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Who will Dodger fans root for?</TE>
<TE>   They'll certainly root against the Giants. But can they root for
the Angels? Or will they turn off the television and go to the
Coliseum and the Rose Bowl and root for college football instead? Not
a bad choice, but they'll be missing the party.</TE>
<TE>   And that's getting so far ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Before the I-5 series comes the NoCal-SoCal weekend, playoff
baseball north and south. By Sunday the Midwest could be finished,
the Twins and the Cardinals sent home after valiant efforts.</TE>
<TE>   It's not too soon to think the Giants are in. No team has lost the
first two games of a seven-game series at home and come back to win.
Goodbye Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's too soon to put the Giants on I-5 south and headed for
Anaheim. It is, isn't it?</TE>

<HD>Another Scandal for FIFA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The corruption scandal that Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, the president of
FIFA, thought he had put behind him in June when he was reelected to
soccer's top post, resurfaced Thursday when one of his key allies was
charged with fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Julio Grondona, president of the Argentine Football Assn. and a
FIFA vice president and executive committee member, is said to have
been involved in the payment of inflated prices and favoritism in the
awarding of contracts to install stadium audio and video security
equipment.</LD>
<LD>   Also charged with administrative fraud in the same case are two
Argentine club leaders, Mauricio Macri, the president of Boca
Juniors, and Fernando Miele, former president of San Lorenzo.</LD>
<TE>   All three have lodged appeals against the charges, which were
leveled by a judge in Buenos Aires and carry possible six-year jail
terms.</TE>
<TE>   "The three have been charged, but ... the charges must now be
approved by a more senior judge, given the appeals," a court
spokesman told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Grondona, 71, has been a FIFA executive committee member for 14
years and was a strong supporter of Blatter, despite the financial
corruption scandal that marked the FIFA president's bitter
re-election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Iran, Japan Reach Final</TE>
<TE>   Iran, the defending champion and three-time winner, and Japan, a
relative outsider, advanced to the final of the Asian Games
tournament in South Korea on Thursday by ousting South Korea and
Thailand, respectively, in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   The Iranians were outplayed by the Koreans in Pusan, but the home
team squandered one scoring opportunity after another and the match
ended in a 0-0 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Iran then advanced on penalty kicks, 5-3, after South Korea's
captain, Lee Young-Pyo, hit the crossbar with his attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, in nearby Ulsan, Japan had far less trouble disposing of
Thailand, 3-0, on goals by Shohei Ikeda, Keita Suzuki and Satoshi
Nakayama.</TE>
<TE>   German Compensation</TE>
<TE>   In a decision with potentially far-reaching consequences, the
German soccer federation (DFB) has agreed to pay Bayern Munich
several hundred thousand dollars in compensation for the injury
sustained by Bayern midfielder Sebastian Deisler while playing for
Germany against Austria on May 18.</TE>
<TE>   Deisler, one of his country's most promising playmakers, missed
the World Cup as a result of the right ankle injury and has been
sidelined ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The German newspaper Bild said the DFB had paid Bayern $544,000 in
compensation, but other media reports suggested the figure might have
exceeded $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder, president of the DFB, said he considers
the settlement a one-time occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Deisler case should not be seen as setting a precedent," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   More likely, however, is that other big-name clubs will seek
remuneration when their players are injured while playing national
team games.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's Choice</TE>
<TE>   Luiz Felipe Scolari, the coach who led Brazil to the 2002 World
Cup, was interviewed as a candidate for the Mexican national team
coaching position, but the Mexican soccer federation (FMF) has denied
that he is the front-runner for the position left vacant by Javier
Aguirre.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no favorite," Alberto de la Torre, the FMF president,
said of the three candidates: Scolari, Carlos Bianchi and Ricardo
Lavolpe.</TE>
<TE>   "One [Lavolpe, the coach of Mexican league leader Toluca] has a
lot of experience in Mexican football; the other [Scolari] has the
advantage of being world champion, and the other [Bianchi] is a world
champion at club level."</TE>
<TE>   Bianchi coached Boca Juniors of Argentina to two South American
titles and an Intercontinental Cup</TE>
<TE>   Arena Contract</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Arena, the coach who led the United States to the
quarterfinals of the World Cup, has agreed in principal to terms of a
new four-year contract, the Washington Post reported, but a U.S.
Soccer spokesman said no announcement will be made until the contract
is signed.</TE>

<HD>There's Still No Quit in Seles</HD>

<LD>Contrary to popular perception, the WTA's season-ending championships
at Staples Center next month won't be the finish line for Monica
Seles, a three-time winner of the event in the early '90s. That's the
thing about perceptions. They might seem grounded in reality, but on
closer examination, the base isn't always as secure as it appears.</LD>
<LD>   Seles, in Los Angeles on Thursday to promote the tournament, is
not making plans far into the future. But an upbeat Seles said she
will play the Australian Open in Melbourne in January, and possibly a
tuneup tournament in Sydney or Hobart, but not the Hopman Cup in
Perth. While Pete Sampras had been besieged by retirement questions
the last two years (before he won the U.S. Open in September), Seles,
who will turn 29 in December, has been facing those issues for about
twice as long.</LD>
<LD>   "That question has not happened at 28; that question, literally,
started at 25," Seles said. "That's what has been really hard. People
forget the last 10-12 years, I've finished in the top five every
year. I see that with someone like Arantxa [Sanchez-Vicario]. We talk
a little.... It's very hard on her. I think everybody should be done
when they want to be done. I really believe it."</LD>
<TE>   There is an underlying double standard, she said, from some
reporters, as though they've decided it is time for her to get
married and have children. Seles said the shove toward the finish
line seems to happen more on the women's side.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like they want you to retire.... Like just say it and
you're done and we scratch you off the list," she said. "The only
time I've ever seen that happen was with Pete. With Andre [Agassi],
they never did it. He [Sampras] was getting this question all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   Now, in a twist, Sampras is asking himself the same thing. In the
first few days after his 14th Grand Slam singles title, the memorable
U.S. Open final against Agassi, Sampras thought he would continue. He
especially wanted to erase the bitter memory of his second-round loss
to lucky loser George Bastl on Court 2 at Wimbledon this year.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, he has wavered. Last week, at a charity match
against Agassi in Philadelphia, he told reporters he would make a
decision about retirement in about a month, saying, "Right now, I'm
going back and forth whether to stop." Seles was surprised that some
of the people who wrote Sampras off were his peers.</TE>
<TE>   "It took almost this one for people to appreciate what he's done,"
she said. "What a way to finish your career. At the same time, I
really think he has a few more grand slams in him. How cool would
that be? Everybody is different. Never say never."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why she is not putting a strict timetable on her own
professional shelf life. In 2002, Seles won two tournaments and
defeated Venus Williams in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   For Seles, the WTA championships will be her final event with her
coach, Mike Sell. Sell has moved to Los Angeles, and Seles intends to
keep her home base in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Name Game</TE>
<TE>   The Nov. 6-11 tournament at Staples has received a title sponsor,
officials said Thursday. It will be called the Home Depot WTA Tour
Championships. The company signed a one-year deal with an option for
two more.</TE>
<TE>   Teenagers Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia and Kim Clijsters of
Belgium have qualified for the tournament, leaving six singles spots
remaining. Lindsay Davenport of Laguna Beach improved her chances of
qualifying, moving into the 16th spot by reaching the final at Moscow
on Sunday. Davenport recently was engaged to Jon Leach, the younger
brother of tour doubles specialist Rick Leach.</TE>
<TE>   Doubles Cuts</TE>
<TE>   The ATP board has approved changes in its prize money structure
for 2003, reducing the prize money for doubles and increasing it for
singles. At Masters Series events, which include Indian Wells, the
prize-money split in 2003 will be 83% (singles) and 17% (doubles).
Last year, it was 78%-22%. Additionally, doubles draws above the
minimum 16 teams will be reduced.</TE>

<LD>UCLA will open defense of its Pacific 10 Conference women's soccer
title against its top two contenders as it plays host to California
tonight and Stanford on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Both teams are ranked in the top 10 by the National Soccer Coaches
Assn. of America. Fifth-ranked Cal (7-2-1) is coming off a victory
over seventh-ranked Wake Forest. No. 2 Stanford (9-1-0) has withstood
the sudden resignation of Coach Andy Nelson before the season.</LD>
<LD>   "We have had some tough games in nonconference so I think we're
ready for the Pac-10 schedule," UCLA Coach Jillian Ellis said. "I
think it helps us to get up emotionally for a big game and also test
us."</LD>
<TE>   The 12th-ranked Bruins (8-2-0) fell in the polls after losing to
defending NCAA champion Santa Clara in overtime last week.
Sarah-Gayle Swanson, Iris Mora, Katie Rivera and Kim Devine each have
five or more goals for a team that has already scored 33. Redshirt
sophomore Lindsay Greco has a team-leading four assists after missing
most of last season because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State women's volleyball player Lindsay Phillips has
been cleared to play for the 49ers by the NCAA after a committee
determined she made enough academic progress in her summer courses to
become eligible.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, a senior outside hitter, will be a boost to a Long Beach
State team that is 13-1 and ranked eighth in the national polls. She
was declared ineligible at the start of the season but the school
filed an appeal with the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine made up a five-shot deficit and won the Club Glove
Intercollegiate men's golf tournament by one stroke over Pepperdine
at Saticoy Country Club in Somis. Senior Jeff Coburn of Irvine made
par on the first playoff hole to defeat New Mexico's Jae Choi and
earned individual medalist honors.</TE>
<TE>   USC senior Mikaela Parmlid defeated Pepperdine senior Lindsey
Wright on the first playoff hole to win the Edean Ihlanfeldt
Invitational women's tournament at Tacoma, Wash. Parmlid entered the
day six strokes behind teammate Becky Lucidi but shot a final-round
68 to tie Wright, who had a 70. USC won the team title by 15 strokes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA defeated USC, 6-3, to win the Nor Cal men's water polo
tournament at Berkeley. The Trojans in the final period as the Bruins
(7-3) won four matches in two days.... Cal State Fullerton (8-1-1) is
in the women's soccer rankings for the first time in school history.
The Titans are 25th in the Soccer Buzz and Soccer America polls.</TE>

<LD>NO. 2 OKLAHOMA (5-0)</LD>
<LD>   AT NO. 3 TEXAS (5-0)</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   TV: None.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Texas by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma update: The Sooners have won the last two clashes with
the Longhorns by a combined score of 77-17--but like Texas, Oklahoma
looked shaky last week, defeating Missouri, 31-24. (Texas edged
Oklahoma State, 17-15.) Oklahoma gives up only 13 points a game, but
Texas is a little better, at 9.4.</TE>
<TE>   Texas update:  Coach Mack Brown and quarterback Chris Simms will
keep taking heat for their performances in big games until they win
more. Simms is 20-4 as a starter, but in his last three games against
top-10 teams, he has 12 turnovers and one touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: The winner has the inside track in the race to play
for the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Texas. Because it's time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 9 FLORIDA STATE (5-1)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 1 MIAMI (5-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Miami by 13.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State update: Bobby Bowden might not have been sandbagging
when he said, "From what I see, it's Miami and the rest of the world.
We're not at that level yet." Miami ended Florida State's 54-game
home unbeaten streak last season, 49-27.</TE>
<TE>   Miami update: The Hurricanes have won 27 in a row. A ferocious
front seven leads a defense that ranks third nationally, giving up
only 241.2 yards, and holding teams to an average of less than 15
points.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Miami and Florida State have traded places, and
although the rivalry is intense, Miami is a step above.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Miami. Florida State lost to Louisville and almost lost
to Iowa State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 10 TENNESSEE (4-1)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 6 GEORGIA (5-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Georgia by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee update: Just a sore shoulder--or a hairline fracture of
his left collarbone? Quarterback Casey Clausen's status is uncertain,
and Coach Phillip Fulmer denied two published reports saying
Clausen's collarbone is cracked. C.J. Leak will take over if Clausen
can't play.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia update: The Bulldogs are trying to become the first team
other than Florida or Tennessee to win the SEC East since the
conference split into two divisions in 1992. But Georgia hasn't
beaten a top-10 SEC team at home since 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Story line:  Georgia must prove it's an elite team.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Georgia. Tennessee needed six overtimes to beat
Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 7 OREGON (5-0)</TE>
<TE>   AT UCLA (4-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: UCLA by 2 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon update: The Ducks' 10-game winning streak is the
second-longest among Division I-A teams, behind Miami's. They started
slow against Arizona last week, but won, 31-14, as Onterrio Smith ran
for 100 yards for the fifth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA update:  Tyler Ebell rushed for 203 yards and Cory Paus
passed for a career-high 378 yards last week at Oregon State. Paus'
accuracy along with Ebell's promise gave the Bruin offense a nice
makeover.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: As usual, it takes a while for the Pacific 10's best
teams to emerge, and this is one of the sorting-out games.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oregon, although the Bruins are favored by oddsmakers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 18 LOUISIANA STATE (4-1)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 16 FLORIDA (4-2)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4:45 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Florida by 8 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana State update:  Running back LaBrandon Toefield is out
because of a broken arm. But LSU's defense is strong, leading the
nation in total defense and pass defense.</TE>
<TE>   Florida update: Rex Grossman threw four interceptions in the
Gators' 17-14 loss to Mississippi last week. Odd as it is to see
Florida with two losses so early, how would three look? Grossman
hasn't lived up to his Heisman hopes, completing only 53.8% of his
passes with 10 interceptions after completing 65.6% of his passes
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: A shifting of power is evident in the SEC as Florida
has lost its aura--at least for the moment.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Florida. The Gators have to get better sometime. Right?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CALIFORNIA (4-2)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 20 USC (3-2)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 3:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Line: USC by 12 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Cal update: Any instinct to dismiss Cal's 3-0 start as a fluke
should be rethought after the Bears' upset of Washington in Husky
Stadium last week. Quarterback Kyle Boller should give the Trojan
secondary a workout.</TE>
<TE>   USC update: The Trojans gave up enough yards in their overtime
loss at Washington State to lose their standing as the nation's
leading defense, but USC still ranks among the top 15 in total
defense, pass defense, pass-efficiency defense and scoring defense.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: USC can't afford another loss.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: USC. But the Bears have won four of the last six in the
series, and USC hasn't beaten Cal in the Coliseum since 1994.</TE>

<HD>Outside Chances Good for Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: With next three games at home and Washburn
pitching tonight, Anaheim likes its situation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dome or home, synthetic grass or the real stuff, the Angels believe
their surroundings will matter less than their mind-set when the
American League championship series resumes tonight at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Having split the first two games in the Minnesota Twins' house of
horrors known as the Metrodome, the Angels returned to the friendly
confines of green grass and blue sky Thursday, knowing they can take
command of the best-of-seven series over the next three games, all at
home. But who they are and how they play, Manager Mike Scioscia said,
will matter more than where they are.</LD>
<LD>   "Our thing all year has been to bring our game wherever we play,"
he said. "Even if we were up, 2-0, it wouldn't change the way we go
about our business. Or if we were 0-2. We'll take it one game at a
time, and let you [reporters] add 'em up."</LD>
<TE>   The numbers add up favorably for the Angels, who will face
left-hander Eric Milton tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who won both of their division series home games
against the Yankees, defeated Milton twice this season and were 30-16
against left-handed starters. In addition, Angel starter Jarrod
Washburn was 2-0 against the Twins this season with a 2.70 earned-run
average. The Twins were 23-29 against left-handed starters and 40-40
on the road, but they beat A's left-hander Mark Mulder last Sunday in
a 5-4 victory at Oakland to clinch their division series.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, we have the left-handed hitting lineup, which makes it a
little tougher for us," Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire said. "You have
to take your chances. We've seen Mr. Washburn plenty of times. We
know he's going to come at you. There's a guy that throws right
around 90 mph, just keeps pumping those fastballs and has the heart
of a lion.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we're going to have to be good and we're going to have to
get after him as best we can. That's the way this team has played all
year."</TE>
<TE>   Which is the same way the Angels have played: patient at the plate
when they sense a pitcher can be worn down, aggressive when they get
the pitches they want, fearless on the basepaths, and resilient
enough to have made "Those plucky Angels" their new unofficial
designation.</TE>
<TE>   Add a bullpen that has given up one hit and no runs and has
recorded 11 strikeouts in 6 2/3 innings over the first two games, and
the Angels are quietly confident.</TE>
<TE>   They're also respectful of the Twins, certainly, and the Twins
have earned respect. Milton beat the A's in Game 4 of the division
series and Brad Radke, Saturday's starter, won the decisive game at
Oakland and has an 11-4 record against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "They've shown they can play well on the road," left fielder
Garret Anderson said, "but all that gets thrown out now. We're not
looking for them to not play well."</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels are looking for their own team to play even better.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take the position we're in," said second baseman Adam
Kennedy, who will sit against Milton to get Benji Gil's right-handed
bat into the lineup. "We definitely had to come out with one.
Milton's been throwing well, and we've got our work cut out for us,
but we'll take that challenge."</TE>
<TE>   For Kennedy and Brad Fullmer, the challenge has been to adjust to
Scioscia's platoon system.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, batting .333 in the first two rounds, and Fullmer--.500
against the Twins, including a double and a home run, and .385 in the
playoffs--will yield today to Gil and Shawn Wooten, respectively.
None of the four is complaining, although each acknowledged he'd like
to win a regular job. And they all know it's not the time to whine.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only that, but the players that are in these roles, we
understand each other," said Gil, who batted .310 in 87 at-bats
against left-handers this season, compared with Kennedy's .275 in 69
at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no doubt that Adam Kennedy could play every day against
left-handers. At the same time, I'm thankful for the opportunity to
play against left-handers. I take this seriously, as a chance to
perform.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I would love to play every day. It's not going to
happen, so I've got to take advantage of the situation when I do get
in."</TE>
<TE>   Wooten, who batted .282 in 71 at-bats against lefties this season
and is batting .600--six for 10--in postseason play, said Scioscia's
platoon system hasn't been divisive or made anyone feel unimportant.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at it as, this is my role on the team, to face lefties,
and I go out there when my name is called," he said. "Whether I'm
playing or not, I'm pulling for the guys. With what has happened
here, with relation to our situation, you can't knock it. We've had a
lot of success. I do want to be an everyday player. That's my
ultimate goal. But this time of year, with this team, I know my
role."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fullmer: "I come to the ballpark every day ready to go, to
battle. I know I can get the job done every single day, but it's not
my decision. It's out of my hands. I just try to contribute.... We're
in the playoffs, and it's all about winning, that's the big thing."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, a northwestern Wisconsin native who grew up attending
games at the Metrodome, said having to watch Kevin Appier and Ramon
Ortiz start the first two games there "was eating at me." But
Washburn, who won the Angels' division-series clincher against the
Yankees last Saturday on three days' rest, said he's rested and ready
and feeling the kind of nervous tension he likes to feel before
starts.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel great. I feel just as good as I did the first month of the
season," he said. "It doesn't feel to me like I've thrown over 200
innings [211 including postseason play].... I'm nervous. It's 1-1.
Now it's a five-game series, and we've got to win three."</TE>

<HD>When It Was Clear Sailing on Zobie's Cat</HD>
<DH>Barely a year before he disappeared, life at sea was very
good for Dele</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK BEAL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Editor's note: Mark Beal is a commercial sea captain and professional
fisherman from Perth, Australia. He sailed with Bison Dele on the
former NBA player's catamaran from February until June 2001. Thirteen
months later, Dele would disappear from the boat with a girlfriend,
Serena Karlan, and the captain, Bertrand Saldo. They are presumed
dead. Beal provided The Times with this account of life in the South
Pacific with Dele.</LD>
<LD>   We're in the Southern Ocean in the teeth of the Roaring Forties,
500 nautical miles from the nearest land mass, Australia.</LD>
<LD>   It feels as if we're on a gentle roller-coaster ride, gliding
along at eight knots down the face of 15-foot swells. The wind hums
through the rigging, and I can hear the water slap our hull and then
hiss and die, the way small waves do when you're standing on a beach.</LD>
<TE>   The sun shines on the open stern end of this 60-foot boat. Half a
dozen albatrosses bank and glide behind us. Occasionally, one will
dive and then pivot 180 degrees on a wingtip, on the very surface of
the water.</TE>
<TE>   The guy who is paying for all this reaches into a bucket of fish
guts and throws a handful over the water. "Hey birdie," he calls.
"Come and get it."</TE>
<TE>   With a growling squawk, the nearest albatross skims the water for
the food. There's always more where that came from. Behind us trails
a shutter cord with a hook and lure. Soon enough, another 30-pound
blue tuna will be hauled in.</TE>
<TE>   My passenger is a big black guy, wearing sunglasses and what we
call a beanie, to keep his head warm. The smile on his face reminds
me of a child's.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to be called Zobie--a name he took from a song--instead
of Brian Williams, or Bison Dele. He liked Australia because the
people didn't know he was a guy who'd turned his back on the NBA and
more money than they'd make in three generations. They just took him
for what he was, except in the sports section of a department store
in Melbourne, where he went one day looking for size 17 shoes. He
picked up a basketball and started dribbling. The staff was
astonished. They were basketball fans and recognized him. They
offered to contact his sponsor for more shoes. "It's OK, man," he
told them. "I'm not sponsored anymore."</TE>
<TE>   His tourist visa had been good for six months, but he'd been in
Australia for at least a year and a half, getting two-week extensions
on the visa, driving around the country in his F100 with a motorbike,
a kayak and six skateboards, just camping anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Zobie had fallen in love with Fremantle, a port town just south of
Perth. He rented an apartment there and wanted to buy a boat to take
him across the Pacific. That was how I met him.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere in his future was a boat pen at a yacht club in L.A. for
this catamaran, the Hakuna Matata. But for now, there was a voyage
from Perth, my hometown, to New Zealand, with anybody he liked along
for the ride. He just wanted to spend two years sailing the Pacific,
ending up in California.</TE>
<TE>   I've been a commercial sea captain and professional fisherman for
22 years, more than half my life. I've seen celebrities, taken them
out to sea, and in the confined space of a boat, you really get to
know someone.</TE>
<TE>   Zobie really was a nice guy. I see that personality in a lot of
people and it's got nothing to do with the sea. Some people are here
for greed. Some people are here to smell the breeze and have a look
around them. Some people have their head in a paper or a computer and
are too busy to do anything else. The difference with Zobie was he
had the money and the time to look around.</TE>
<TE>   We talked a lot about the NBA, and those were the only times I saw
him really stressed.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, dude," he'd say, "these guys push you and push you, you get
injured, you're broken and strained and they push you out there."</TE>
<TE>   He was disdainful and a bit cynical of the hype and the attention
paid to something that was just a game. He felt like his soul hadn't
been put in the right area. That's why he was into all the hippie
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   I met some friends of his from Israel who were backpacking around
Australia. He'd always go for the hippie types, the feral ones. They
were into the cosmic world and spirituality and soul searching. These
people don't have anything else in their lives. He was just doing it
for fun, and he'd never done anything like it before.</TE>
<TE>   When we caught the tuna in the Southern Ocean, I got him to pull
them in by hand. They're dark blue with flecks of yellow. He'd pat
them and say, "What a beautiful fish." Then he'd thank the ocean for
the fish, and the fish for providing us with food.</TE>
<TE>   He got seasick only once, when we were running before a storm in
the Southern Ocean, trying to reach the sheltered waters closer to
Australia. We ended up in Melbourne, just as the Formula One Grand
Prix came to town.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived in Melbourne about 1 a.m. Later that morning, Zobie
grabbed his skateboard and disappeared. He was gone the rest of that
day and the following night.</TE>
<TE>   I've been around enough celebrities to know they live in a
different world. It's smaller than ours and they all seem to know
each other. When we got to Melbourne, Zobie disappeared. He was a
friend of David Coulthard, one of the Formula One drivers.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned, it was with a film crew. They were including him
in a documentary on the Grand Prix.</TE>
<TE>   It was a big weekend in Melbourne. Cirque du Soleil was also
performing. Zobie knew someone there, too. We got free tickets to the
celebrity tent and spent the night drinking champagne.</TE>
<TE>   That was unusual--the drinking, I mean. Zobie was very straight.
He said he never drank when he was in the NBA. He just wasn't into
it. He told me he'd get into trouble with his coaches because he'd
want to go home and sleep in his own bed, rather than in the team
hotel before a home game. He'd say, "Coach, you know I don't go out
and party. I just want to be in my own bed."</TE>
<TE>   When we were ashore, he wanted to live as much as party. He always
wanted to kick a soccer ball around, ride a bike or try some tricks
on one of his skateboards. We stopped for Easter just north of
Sydney, a place called Pittwater. I was able to talk him onto a
surfboard, but not into standing up. He caught some waves lying down
on my longboard.</TE>
<TE>   The other side of life in the NBA was that he could afford to
travel like this. We were in a beachside cafe one day, and saw a big
rug with a French abstract design hanging on the wall. Zobie fell in
love with it and wanted to buy it.</TE>
<TE>   I went to the counter and asked if it was for sale. It was, for
$2,000.</TE>
<TE>   So he went around the corner, pulled $2,000 out of an ATM and paid
for it. The rug went into the lounge of the catamaran. The boat had
cost him $600,000. I spent a couple of weeks preparing it for the
trip. On one of those days, I bought a small dive compressor, to
provide air for scuba diving. Then we went to a dive shop and bought
two complete scuba outfits. By the end of the afternoon, there was
another $5,000 on his gold card.</TE>
<TE>   We talked about money sometimes. I said if I had lots of money,
I'd buy blue-chip stocks. "What if you stuck it in the bank and lived
off the interest?" he replied. I guess that's what he was doing</TE>
<TE>   He was definitely into chatting about everything--a big thinker,
and a very clever man, very practical with mechanical things.</TE>
<TE>   Zobie had an emotional side, but I never saw any aggression. I
believe he suffered from manic-depression. There were times when he
was really low--you could see it in his face. He would say he was
grumpy. He wasn't trying to hide it. He was quite open with
everything. Those moods never lasted more than two days.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know what went on in the basketball scene. I don't think
he wanted to take any medication. He never said or admitted he was
manic-depressive--it's my observation--but he used to get really down
and really high.</TE>
<TE>   He was a very sensitive bloke; wasn't afraid to show emotion,
although I never saw him cry. But then again, when you have a really
strong connection with someone, and you want to show them how strong
that connection is through sharing an emotion, he'd be crying with
laughter sometimes when we talked.</TE>
<TE>   We talked about his brother and his stepfather, so I knew of his
brother's existence, but it was only general, friendly conversation.
There was no animosity or sense that anything was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   There were seven of us on the boat when we left Fremantle in
February 2000: five guys--Zobie, myself and Bruce, a deckhand,
another guy who swam to shore after the first night and hitchhiked
back to Perth, a fifth who got off two days later, and two women,
Megan and Emily, whom Zobie had invited along.</TE>
<TE>   Emily came along as his girlfriend, but it was pretty casual. In
the Southern Ocean at night, we used to steer by automatic pilot, but
there would always be somebody up on the deck keeping watch for four
or five hours at a time. Zobie took his turn doing that, and Megan
kept him company one night.</TE>
<TE>   He'd say, "Hey, dolphins have sex for fun. Why hide the fact that
we enjoy it?"</TE>
<TE>   Some of our discussions were about life and death, almost
literally. One of our sail plans, when we were still in Fremantle,
was to go through Southeast Asia, where piracy on the open seas is a
real problem.</TE>
<TE>   I felt if we were going that way, we may need some weapons. Some
people do carry them. I wasn't sure. Zobie was totally against it.
His feeling was, if we were boarded by pirates, we'd give 'em what
they wanted--give them the boat if we had to, as long as they spared
our lives.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, our trip took us through the Roaring Forties, and then up
the east coast of Australia. I fell sick in Brisbane, and decided to
head home to recover.</TE>
<TE>   That was in late May, early June last year. Zobie took it badly.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, man," he said. "Am I ever going to see you again?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   We had a pretty deep respect for each other. When I first heard
what had happened to him, I felt really sad.</TE>
<TE>   There's someone who you live in the same small place with, and
share a lot of time with ... naturally, it's a really sad thing.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, I broke a bone in my neck while surfing in
Indonesia where I was working. There was no insurance and it cost me
a fortune to get back here.</TE>
<TE>   You have time to think while you're recovering from something like
that, and what I think is, it could have been worse. I might have
been on the boat with Zobie in July near Tahiti.</TE>

<LD>The American Bowling Congress has certified Pat and Joey Dineen as
the third father-son tandem to bowl 300s in the same league game.
Pat, 49, and Joey, 21, did it at the AMF Indian River Lanes in
Virginia Beach, Va., on April 25.</LD>
<LD>   "When I stepped up in the 10th frame, no one was bowling in the
house," Pat told the Hampton Roads Daily Press. "It reminded me of
the first time I bowled 300 ... the entire house stopped."</LD>
<LD>   Comment by Dwight Perry of the Seattle Times: "In fact, it got so
quiet you could almost hear a ... nah, too easy."</LD>
<TE>   More Perry: "News flash: USA Today reports that Augusta National
is a par 72 in more ways than one. Its average member is 72 years of
age, with Ben Gilmer carding a high of 25-over 97.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes it one of the few golf venues where it's actually a
good thing to be a few strokes behind the leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which pitcher holds the single-game World Series
record for strikeouts?</TE>
<TE>   Is the clock ticking? The Yankees have been eliminated from the
playoffs, but Manager Joe Torre told Mike Vaccaro of the New Jersey
Star-Ledger that calls from owner George Steinbrenner have all been
supportive.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows that the job he has done in seven years as Yankee
manager may have brought him a deeper line of credit than any other
employee has ever enjoyed in the 29-year reign of Steinbrenner,"
Vaccaro wrote. "But there is a limit to that. Even for him."</TE>
<TE>   Willing to oblige: Boston Celtic forward Vin Baker paid teammate
Kedrick Brown $10,000 to surrender jersey No. 42.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jim O'Brien told the Boston Herald: "Is there anything he
wants from me? Shoes? How about playing time? I'm sure we can work
something out."</TE>
<TE>   Midshipmen mishaps: "When we decide to self-destruct," says Navy
football Coach Paul Johnson, whose team has had 15 turnovers in
losing four games, "we're really good at it."</TE>
<TE>   Brett from Motor City: From the Caught on the Fly column in the
Sporting News: "A Stanley Cup isn't the only thing Brett Hull's
picked up in his time in Dee-troit. The Spies at the Wings' training
camp spotted Golden Brett tooling around in a jet-black '64 Lincoln
Continental convertible. Hey-yo, talk about buying into Motown."</TE>
<TE>   Bet on it: Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle, after
the St. Paul Pioneer Press had reported that Metrodome noise levels
reached 107 decibels during Game 3 of the Twins-A's playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's a record, it undoubtedly will be broken at the Yankees'
first postseason staff meeting as soon as George Steinbrenner walks

<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1991, Chip Beck shot the second
sub-60 round in PGA Tour history, a 59 at the Las Vegas Invitational.
Beck carded a 29-30, 13 under par, to match Al Geiberger's second
round at the 1977 Memphis Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals, 17, against
the Detroit Tigers on Oct. 2, 1968.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: "The latest NCAA figures have Tennessee's football
players graduating at a rate of 5%," says Mike Bianchi of the Orlando
Sentinel. "It's no wonder the Vols can't execute a center snap. They
get confused when the count goes past 'hut two.' "</TE>

<LD>BUFFALO AT HOUSTON</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Buffalo by 7.</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: David Carr, Drew Bledsoe feels your pain.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: It is hoped Carr enjoyed his first NFL bye week, because the
pounding on the Texans' rookie quarterback resumes Sunday against the
Bills. Houston has allowed 26 sacks in four games--on pace to equal
the league record for most times sacked in a season, 104, set by
Philadelphia in 1986 and endured by Ron Jaworski (until he was
mercifully knocked out in Game 10), Randall Cunningham and Matt
Cavanaugh. Buffalo's Bledsoe has been there, absorbing such a beating
in nine New England seasons that it cost him his job, and eventually
sent him packing. Bledsoe is here to inform Carr: Things do get
better.</TE>

Shop"</TE>

<TE>   CAROLINA AT DALLAS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Dallas by 2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Journeyman journeys back to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Rodney Peete has been to two conference finals, most
recently with the 2000 Raiders, although he did not play in either.
The first was with the 1994 Cowboys, Peete serving as Troy Aikman's
backup. Since then, Peete and the Cowboys have gone their separate
ways--Peete winding up in Carolina, the Cowboys winding up with
Quincy Carter. Who's the better for it? Last we checked, Peete was
losing at home to Arizona, 16-13, and Kid Carter was overthrowing a
wide-open Antonio Bryant near the end zone to preserve a 21-17 loss
to the Giants. Moral of the story: Change is not necessarily a good
thing.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Youth Is Served Up on a Platter"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ATLANTA AT NEW YORK GIANTS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Off.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Vick as in quick, though probably not this week.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Michael Vick throws with his left arm and runs with his
legs, so why should a sprained right shoulder keep him out of
Sunday's game at the Meadowlands? Falcon fans demand an inquiry.
Giant defensive end Michael Strahan, meanwhile, stopped just short of
turning cartwheels at the news of Vick's "doubtful" status: "Yeah, I
prefer to run around and watch a guy beat me 20 yards to nothing. You
could give me a 30-yard lead in the 40 and he'd still beat me. If
he's not going to play, it's a definite hit for them." If he's not
going to play, it's Doug Johnson's game to lose. Most likely, he
will.</TE>

Elway Come Flooding Back"</TE>

<TE>   BALTIMORE AT INDIANAPOLIS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Indianapolis by 7.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Colts host Baltimore. It's a ball of confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Somewhere, Johnny U is sadly shaking his head. His old team,
the Colts, plays host to the transplants from Cleveland and the team
from his old town, Baltimore, has to travel to Indianapolis to play
the Colts. This is an end-around and then some, not as simple as it
was in the Lenny Moore days. But then, nothing in the NFL is anymore.
Take the Ravens: They gutted their roster and now have the
second-lowest payroll in the league, they rank 28th in offense, 21st
in defense and have somehow scraped out a 2-2 record. And in today's
NFL, that's enough for first place in the AFC North.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Colts Do It to Baltimore Again, This Time in
the Middle of the Day"</TE>

<TE>   NEW ORLEANS AT WASHINGTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New Orleans by 1.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: This week's episode of "Spurrier and the Coaches He
Has Offended."</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Steve Spurrier was months removed from the NFL last January
when he lobbed the first insult Jim Haslett's way. Calling him
"Hazelet," Spurrier noted the Saints' 0-4 season-ending slide and
mused, "I saw a story where Jim Hazelet comes in [to work] at 4:30 in
the morning. That's not doing him any good." Since then, the coaches
have actually gutted out a breakfast together and Haslett reports
that Spurrier is "a relatively nice guy." But this is not breakfast,
and Spurrier is bringing a rookie quarterback, Patrick Ramsey, to the
table, and this is Hazelet's payback, relatively speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Early Bird Catches Up With Spurrier"</TE>

<TE>   GREEN BAY AT NEW ENGLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New England by 5.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Terry Glenn, MIA no more.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In New England, Glenn is considered the millstone that had
to be shed before the Patriots could launch their Super Bowl climb.
Suspended twice in 2001, Glenn appeared in only three games for the
Patriots, did not play a down during the postseason and did not
receive a Super Bowl ring. Traded to the Packers with a loud "good
riddance," Glenn is now catching passes--eight for 154 yards in
Monday's victory over the Bears--and praise from Brett Favre. Sunday,
Glenn returns to Foxboro to catch a few more things, among them an
earful.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Glenn Catches Flak, Not Much Else in Packer
Defeat"</TE>

<TE>   DETROIT AT MINNESOTA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Minnesota by 4.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Lions, Vikings are back after open dates. Anybody
miss them?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: What to do about Randy Moss? Bench him? New Viking Coach
Mike Tice is 0-4 and suspects he doesn't have the time to take the
chance. Suspend him? The league is mulling that option. Taking care
not to further ostracize their troubled diva, the Vikings tried to
make Moss feel like one of the guys and decided to take off every
play last Sunday, every one of them. But that's a temporary fix at
best--NFL schedule limits all 32 teams to only one open date
each--and so the Vikings will be back on the field Sunday, with only
the 1-3 Lions separating them from a long, downward spiral.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "It's Now or Never for Vikings. Never Wins
Going Away."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PITTSBURGH AT CINCINNATI</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 6.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Steelers are back after unprecedented bye month.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: So quarterback Tommy Maddox couldn't save the Steelers from
themselves in last week's 32-29 loss to New Orleans. So Pittsburgh is
1-3 after the Saints scored on seven of their first eight possessions
and is yielding an average of 26 points a game. For the Steelers, the
season starts here--eight of their next 10 games are against
Cincinnati (twice), Baltimore, Cleveland, Atlanta, Tennessee, Houston
and Carolina. Only a game out of first place in the NFL's worst
division, the AFC North, the Steelers are far from out of it, which
explains why Coach Bill Cowher is starting Maddox instead of Kordell
Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Steelers Wake Up 2-3, Tied for First Place"</TE>

<TE>   CLEVELAND AT TAMPA BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Off.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: After three last-second defeats, Browns take care of
business early.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Cleveland fans have had it with their team's penchant for
losing games on the last play, including last Sunday's interception
in the end zone against Baltimore. They are venting their
frustrations on quarterback Tim Couch, erstwhile golden boy, booing
him when he's on the field and cheering when he's hurt. Couch lashed
back, noting how he's "laid it on the line for this team and this
city" and for the city "to turn on me and boo me in my home stadium
is a joke." Good thing Couch gets a trip this weekend. Too bad it had
to be to Tampa.</TE>

<TE>   OAKLAND AT ST. LOUIS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 8.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: L.A. Ex.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Raiders and the Rams hold a traitorous reunion,
celebrating the eighth anniversary of the Great Betrayal of Los
Angeles. How times have changed: The Raiders are 4-0, averaging 40.5
points a game and running roughshod over the league. How times
haven't changed: The Rams are 0-5 amid accusations of quitting on the
season and their coach, which is a straight lift from the Anaheim
Rams' 1990-94 playbook. Question: Is Ram quarterback Jamie Martin
talking about his knee or his team when he says, "There's a lot of
discomfort. The flexion and the range of motion isn't there."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Georgia Gets Her Just Desserts; Shame About
Al, Though"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JACKSONVILLE AT TENNESSEE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Jacksonville by 2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: With owners like Bud Adams, who needs a new job?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: At 1-4, the Titans are off to their worst start since their
move from Houston. Who's to blame? Owner Bud Adams opts for Coach
Jeff Fisher: "It looks like we're getting out-coached." Fisher
assigns responsibility elsewhere: "Right now, we are not a good
football team." Fingers pointed, the Titans might want to pay notice
to the team flying into town. The Jaguars are 3-1 and considered a
big early season surprise, mainly by those who forgot how good a team
the Jaguars once were when Fred Taylor, Jimmy Smith and Mark Brunell
were in the lineup together. The Titans will soon remember.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Titans One-Win Wonders, Same as Houston"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KANSAS CITY AT SAN DIEGO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Diego by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Martyball comes full circle.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: It was easier in the old days: Once a year, the Chiefs would
come to San Diego and the stadium now called Qualcomm would
reverberate with venom and vitriol, most of it directed at the
staunch conservative in the red warmup jacket, Marty Schottenheimer,
as he played for field goals. Now, Schottenheimer is not only a
Charger but he's 4-1 in his new attire--and the Chiefs come in
flinging the football all over the yard. Brace yourself, San Diegans,
this is going to be a wild one. Wilder than you want if defenders
Junior Seau, Rodney Harrison and Marcellus Wiley aren't recovered
from leg injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Chiefs Welcome Marty to 21st Century, 4-2"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MIAMI AT DENVER</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Denver by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Griese against the Dolphins. What would Dad say?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The apple didn't fall far from the tree--Brian Griese, son
of Bob, has become a winning quarterback in the NFL. Or maybe it
did--so far this season, young Griese was nearly benched in the
season opener, injured by his dog and yelled at by the Bronco
coaching staff. Yet Griese held it together in last week's victory
over the Chargers, passing for 316 yards and holding off Steve
Beuerlein for another week. Next up: Miami, 4-1, same as Denver.
Edges? Miami has Ricky Williams; Denver has not allowed a 100-yard
rushing performance in 19 games. Also: Broncos are 165-54-1 at home.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Shanahan: He's 5-1, How Can I Bench Him?"</TE>

<TE>   SAN FRANCISCO AT SEATTLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Jeff Garcia versus Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In its chardonnay-and-sourdough heart of hearts, is San
Francisco a football or a baseball town? ABC is about to find out,
with Game 5 of the National League championship series and
49ers-Seahawks scheduled to go head-to-head. Fans of the long ball
will opt for Barry Bonds, because the 2002 49ers are not the aerial
show of yesteryear, or even last year, relying now on defense and
handoffs to Garrison Hearst. Still, there's a chance the 49ers could
outscore the Giants and Cardinals. Seattle's defense is 28th in the
NFL. Even the Vikings managed 23 points against it.</TE>

<HD>Virginia Tech Stays Unbeaten</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Virginia Tech stayed unbeaten by doing what it does best--run the
ball and force turnovers--in opening Big East Conference play with a
28-23 victory over Boston College on Thursday night at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Suggs and Kevin Jones each rushed for more than 140 yards as
the No. 4 Hokies improved to 6-0.</LD>
<LD>   "Basically, it was run it and pound it," Virginia Tech Coach Frank
Beamer said. "For the overall goals of this football team, we need to
throw it better."</LD>
<TE>   That hasn't been necessary so far as Virginia Tech has averaged
240 yards rushing and the defense has produced 20 turnovers. The
offense has committed only five.</TE>
<TE>   The Hokies, second in the nation in turnover differential, needed
three turnovers in or near the end zone to stop Boston College drives
and win their seventh game in a row against the Eagles (3-2, 0-2).
Virginia Tech had three interceptions against Brian St. Pierre and
one fumble recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "All in all, that's a good night against that defense,'' Boston
College Coach Tom O'Brien said of St. Pierre, who threw for 232 yards
and was sacked once.</TE>
<TE>   The Hokies have one game left against a ranked team, No. 1 Miami
in the regular-season finale.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terry Jackson II and Thomas Tapeh combined for 415 yards rushing
and Benji Kamrath threw for 101 yards as Minnesota held off a
Northwestern rally for a 45-42 Big Ten Conference victory at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson ran for 239 yards in 37 carries and two touchdowns to help
the Gophers (6-1, 2-1) race to a 24-point lead in the third quarter.
But Northwestern (2-5, 0-2) scored 21 points in the fourth quarter
before Minnesota was able to run out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Colorado quarterback Craig Ochs will play for Division I-AA
Montana next season, according to Grizzlies Coach Joe Glenn.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can say is he is verbally committed to the University of
Montana and will enroll in classes starting in January," Glenn said.</TE>
<TE>   Ochs, who had considered a transfer to Washington, will apply for
a medical redshirt. He played two games for the Buffaloes before
suffering a season-ending concussion. If the redshirt is granted,
Ochs would have two years of eligibility remaining.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Louisville tight end Ronnie Ghent will miss the rest of the season
after injuring two ligaments in his right knee during Tuesday's
victory at Memphis.... Wide receiver-outfielder Roscoe Crosby said he
would withdraw from classes at Clemson for this semester and go to
the Kansas City Royals complex in Arizona to rehab his surgically
repaired right elbow. Crosby should recover completely by spring and
be ready for professional baseball next summer and college football
next fall.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State cornerback Richard McNutt, the subject of a
tongue-in-cheek Heisman trophy campaign, is expected to miss the rest
of the season because of a degenerative condition in his right ankle.
Freshman E.J. Underwood will start in McNutt's place against San Jose
State.... Oregon officials say Onterrio Smith will replace receiver
Keenan Howry on the school's 172-foot billboard in Times Square next
week. Oregon had planned to change the billboard midway through the
season and Smith's play has earned him the promotional spot.</TE>

<HD>Ducks' Opening Act Is Hit</HD>
<DH>Hockey: McDonald, Smirnov and Chistov are unlikely leaders
of 4-3 victory over the Blues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>At least Mighty Duck center Andy McDonald was in the U.S. a year ago,
playing for minor league Cincinnati. He could take solace in the fact
he was on the same continent with the NHL.</LD>
<LD>   Alexei Smirnov was sweating it out with Moscow CSKA in the Russian
Super League. Stanislav Chistov had it worse, cooling his heels in
Moscow, mired in a dispute with his Russian team.</LD>
<LD>   The distance they traveled intersected Thursday night, when the
Ducks opened their season with a 4-3 victory over the St. Louis
Blues.</LD>
<TE>   Their play allowed the Ducks to win before an announced crowd of
16,927 even though Paul Kariya, Adam Oates and Petr Sykora went
scoreless.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald and Chistov each had a goal and three assists. Smirnov
had a goal and one assist. As a result, the Ducks won for only the
second time in 10 season openers.</TE>
<TE>   It has been that kind of week in St. Louis. The Rams are 0-5. The
Cardinals have lost the first two games in the National League
championship series. And the Blues, the fourth-best team in the
Western Conference last season, had their opener spoiled by a
day-care  line.</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite a blessing," Oates said. "They're young guys. We
have to tell them that it is not always this easy."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks downplayed the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a bunch of kids who were excited," first-year Coach Mike
Babcock said. "Wait until they have to fly all over the world and see
how excited they are about hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Chistov, who has flown around the world, seems familiar with the
drill.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lucky game," said Chistov, 19.</TE>
<TE>   Even if it were, it was a welcomed sight for the Ducks, who lost
21 one-goal games last season. General Manager Bryan Murray went on a
talent hunt this summer, trying to find some offense. He signed Oates
and defenseman Fredrik Olausson and traded for Sykora.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it was two players signed in June who were most effective
against the Blues. Chistov, the Ducks' top pick in the 2001 draft,
spent last year as a pawn, with his club team trying to keep him in
Russia. Smirnov, 20, was the Ducks' No. 1 pick in 2000, was out of
sight, but was not out of mind after a brief appearance in training
camp two seasons ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys like that bring youthful enthusiasm," Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   Babcock went for that youthful experience, juggling his lines
midway through the first period. That brought McDonald, Chistov and
Smirnov together.</TE>
<TE>   "You can write down the lines down on paper all you want in the
summer, but until you start playing the real games, you have to work
those things out," Babcock said. "I wasn't really happy with the way
our third line was playing in the first period."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald, 25 and the veteran of the three having played 53 games
last season and 69 in his career, got things started in the second
period. Chistov centered a pass to Mike Leclerc, who found McDonald
alone by the left post. His power-play goal tied the score, 1-1, at
11:37 of the second period.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been learning process for me," said McDonald, who played
well after being called up in December. "It was a necessary step for
me to go to Cincinnati [last season], because of my size, I had to
learn to be tougher on the puck."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald, who is 5 feet 10, put on 10 pounds during the
off-season. He also was named Canada's top forward at the World
Championships last spring. He came to camp a known quantity.</TE>
<TE>   "You can play anybody with Andy," Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if they don't speak English.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 'Chip it in' and 'Chip it out,' is all the English those

<TE>   Nothing was lost in the translation.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov and Smirnov charged to the net in the second period.
McDonald centered to Smirnov, who flicked it to Chistov, who buried a
shot into the upper left-hand corner of the net for a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov struck next, again charging the net with Chistov. This
time, Smirnov knocked in the puck, breaking a 2-2 tie 1:33 into the
third period.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me between the second and third period that he was going
to score," defenseman Ruslan Salei said. "He said he could feel it."</TE>

<HD>At Gabrielino, a Team Plays in Pain as a Campus Grieves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was supposed to be a time of joy, of banners and balloons,
flowers, a queen and her court, and, with some luck, a few touchdowns
by the football team to keep the crowd in good cheer.</LD>
<LD>   But any celebrating was put on hold Thursday night as San Gabriel
Gabrielino High football players, coaches and fans contemplated
something far more serious than what was to have been their
homecoming game.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Castillo, a junior two-way starter for the football team
whose outgoing way and musical talents have made him popular in
circles far removed from the locker room, remains in a coma at
Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills.</LD>
<TE>   Castillo, 16, complained of a headache and blurry vision as he
huddled with teammates and coaches during a timeout in a game against
Burbank last Friday night. A few minutes later, after being sent to
the sideline by a coach, he slumped over and collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Early the following morning, he had surgery to remove a blood clot
from the left side of his brain. The next day, Sunday, similar
surgery was performed in the same area.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, school resumed, but the Gabrielino campus community
has not been the same. At the beginning of the second period of
classes, teachers read a statement from Principal Gene Murphy,
explaining to the few who hadn't already heard that their popular
schoolmate had been hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   Later that morning, student leaders decided to postpone homecoming
festivities this week, and a large yellow banner with Castillo's name
on it was placed on a wall near a campus courtyard. On it, dozens of
students wrote to him.</TE>
<TE>   "You are a big part of us and we can't wait for you to return. I
promise I won't poke you in the eye anymore. Just remember we are all
here for you," read one.</TE>
<TE>   And another: "You have to get better because you need to be
kicking ... with your bass guitar."</TE>
<TE>   Many students underwent crisis counseling offered by school
officials throughout the week.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids who have seen Andrew in the hospital have been traumatized,"
said Gary Goodson, superintendent of the San Gabriel Unified School
District. "It's not a Hollywood scene."</TE>
<TE>   Expressions of their grief were evident Thursday night as the team
played Pasadena High at East Los Angeles College. Players wore
Castillo's number, 32, on a patch stitched into their uniform near
the front of the left shoulder. Several players took it a step
further, writing the number in black marker on their wristbands or
directly on their biceps. Banners shouted encouragement: "Do it for
Drew!" one read.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Eagle players decided to dedicate the season to
Castillo, and afterward some lamented the night's 0-0 tie.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to win [for Castillo]," senior lineman Sterling Whitaker
said. "We tried as hard as we can. We didn't let them score."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities still aren't sure what happened to Castillo, even
after poring over game film.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, 5 feet 10 and 200 pounds, started the game as the
fullback on offense and linebacker on defense. He scored a touchdown
on a four-yard run, but at halftime he told coaches he was tired, so
they played him only on defense during the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Vince Lopez said Castillo did not make the primary hit on
any of the tackles that directly preceded him leaving the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't put our finger on it," Goodson said. "What play was
it? What tackle was it? ... There's no defining moment."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the circumstances were similar to an incident during
another Southern California high school football game a little more
than a year before.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Colby, a linebacker for Costa Mesa High, collapsed shortly
after walking off the field during a game against Huntington Beach
Ocean View. He died the next morning when he was taken off life
support, having never regained consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Colby's death was attributed to injuries caused by repeated blows
to the head. He, too, had complained of headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials are providing no specifics about Castillo's
condition at the request of his family. All they will say is that he
remains in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, who started Gabrielino's football program when the school
opened in 1994, is trying to remain upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "In this situation, we don't want to hope or dwell on the
negative," he said. "We expect Andrew to beat this and to get
better."</TE>

<HD>Howell, Furyk Beat the Winds in Las Vegas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Howell III got in with a seven-under-par 65 before the wind
started to blow Thursday and tied three-time champion Jim Furyk for
the second-round lead in the Invensys Classic at Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Howell and Furyk took advantage of early tee times before
afternoon winds picked up to set the pace at 12 under after two
rounds of the 90-hole tournament played at three courses.</LD>
<LD>   Howell, coming off his first win last week at the Michelob
Championship, got to 12 under with an eagle on No. 13, then parred
the rest of the way as the wind began to pick up in the desert.</LD>
<TE>   "Now that I've won a tournament I'm probably a little more
relaxed," Howell said. "That's probably the No. 1 thing. I'm just
more relaxed."</TE>
<TE>   Howell and Furyk were both at 12 under, though Furyk's total of
131 was a stroke better because one of his rounds came on the par-71
TPC Canyons course, one of three in rotation in the pro-am event.</TE>
<TE>   The leaderboard was crowded, though scores weren't as low as they
were the first round when U.S. Open winners Lee Janzen and Steve
Jones were nine under.</TE>
<TE>   Janzen followed his 63 with a 74 in the second round, but Jones
was among a group of five players one shot off the lead after
shooting a 70 at TPC Summerlin despite a double bogey on the
par-three 14th.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's Carin Koch shot a 10-under 62 on rain-softened greens to
take a three-stroke lead after the first round of the LPGA Tournament
of Champions at Mobile, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam, planning to play the final five events of the
season in a bid to break Mickey Wright's LPGA Tour record of 13
victories in a season, had a 66, and Nancy Lopez shot a 68 in her
final event as a tour regular.</TE>
<TE>   Koch had the lowest round of her career, but it won't count as a
course or tournament record because players were allowed to use
preferred lies through the fairway.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Se Ri Pak opened with a 65 on the Magnolia
Grove Golf Club's Crossings Course. Sorenstam was at 66 along with
Janice Moodie, Patricia Meunier-Lebouc and Emilee Klein.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam won the Samsung World Championship last week for her
career-high ninth tour victory of the year and 40th career title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Greater Hartford Open is in danger of being dropped from next
year's PGA Tour schedule if organizers can't secure at least $4
million from sponsors by next month. ... Shinnecock Hills in
Southampton, N.Y., is being extended to at least 7,000 yards for the
2004 U.S. Open. Shinnecock played at 6,944 yards for the 1995 Open
when Corey Pavin won with par 280 for the 72 holes.</TE>

<HD>Any Women at Augusta Yet?</HD>
<DH>Commentary: Despite words of support from some important
members, no quick resolution is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Burk, leader of the most famous women's movement in sports, is
conducting an interview on her cellular phone as she rides the train
from her office in Washington to a meeting in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to speak on children and family," Burk said. "I wish I
could get a fraction of the coverage on that issue as I've gotten for
golf."</LD>
<LD>   Doubtful. Maybe when Tiger Woods gets married, starts a family and
asks Burk, chair of the National Council of Women's Organizations,
for a little parenting advice or how to get along with his wife.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, the hugely divisive and intensely emotional
conflict about whether Augusta National Golf Club should admit female
members rambles on, well into its fourth month and gathering
momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Burk started the commotion by saying in a letter to Augusta
National Chairman Hootie Johnson that she wanted to discuss the club
adding a woman member. She is pleased to have received backing for
that cause recently in statements from such heavyweights as Kenneth
I. Chenault, chairman of American Express; Sanford I. Weill, chairman
of Citigroup, and Lloyd Ward, chief executive of the U.S. Olympic
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes what looks like a trend is misleading. No matter how
many corporate titans who are Augusta members come out in support of
admitting women to the exclusive, male-only club, don't expect a
swift resolution to the confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders at Augusta National insist high-profile public messages
of support for admitting women to the club have no effect on the
issue; they indicate no widespread support by the nearly 300 members;
and, most disturbingly, might instead reflect a simple attempt to
appease anyone who would be offended by the club's position and
annoyed by being associated with the club.</TE>
<TE>   Burk says she is aware that such a tactic is plausible, but she
prefers not to buy into it, at least for now.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concerned about that," she said. "If they think just
making a public statement and 'OK, that's done,' then I would become
concerned. Right now, I don't feel that way. I'm considering these
public statements as being made in good faith."</TE>
<TE>   More can be expected. Burk wrote letters to as many as 25 club
members who are also chief executive officers of large corporations
and asked them to come out publicly in support of women members.
Others who have received letters are former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn,
U.S. Ambassador to England Will Farish and Congressman Amory Houghton
Jr. of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Burk took issue with the involvement of Farish.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that a public figure on the public payroll would be a
member of a club that practices discrimination is pretty appalling,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The first wave of public utterances about the women's issue from
Augusta members continues. Former Ford Motor Co. President Harold A.
Poling told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that he expects a woman
will join him as a member and suggested that the timing should be
something along the lines of the sooner the better.</TE>
<TE>   You bet he does, because women tend to buy cars too.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times, quoting an unnamed club member, reported a
week ago that as many as 20 members agree with Weill, Chenault and
Ward.</TE>
<TE>   "Then that would make the vote about 280-20," a source at the club
said.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, there could be a purge of club members who might
have become too vocal for the majority's taste. Club rules state that
the chairman, Johnson (who had heart surgery last month), is the only
proper spokesman for the club, so it could be argued that anyone who
has spoken out is already in hot water.</TE>
<TE>   And down the road, in four or five years, after this issue has
gone away, Augusta National would have the last word by simply not
sending out dues notices to members it considers nonconforming.
Sorry, kid, turn in your playbook and your green jacket.</TE>
<TE>   So it goes in this evolving dilemma, in which the easy way out is
not much of an option. The short version is that the club members
won't be pressured into admitting a woman, even if it's something
they have basically considered for some time, because they do not
enjoy being forced. At the same time, the NCWO's only option is to
use pressure on all sides.</TE>
<TE>   In those letters she sent out asking for support, Burk indicated
she prefers a fast track too. She asked for a timetable on progress
and whether they would be willing to resign. Her reasoning is pretty
direct.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, working on the inside just becomes an excuse to
remain a member," Burk said.</TE>
<TE>   She says the best idea for any corporate chief-Augusta National
member is to climb on board the train and look like a leader. Don't
wait or it might appear you were dragged reluctantly on board.</TE>
<TE>   "These CEO's are used to looking like leaders," Burk said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but chances are this is one track they never thought
they would be traveling.</TE>

<HD>Injury to Keep Terrell Out Two Months</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chicago Bear wide receiver David Terrell will be out two months after
having surgery Thursday to repair a broken bone in his right foot.
Doctors inserted a screw in the foot, and Coach Dick Jauron said
there were no problems with the surgery.</LD>
<LD>   "We anticipate it will be seven to eight weeks," Jauron said.
"He'll be monitored obviously through the whole rehab. If he heals
significantly faster, maybe we'll get him back sooner."</LD>
<LD>   If not, Terrell won't be back on the field until Nov. 24 or Dec.
1. That's a lot of time for a second-year player to miss.</LD>
<TE>   Especially when the flamboyant receiver was just starting to hit
his stride. The Bears' top pick in the 2001 draft has nine catches
for 127 yards this year, three for touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   He had his best game Monday, catching three passes for 77 yards in
the 34-21 loss to Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Michael Vick unable to finish practice Thursday, Coach Dan
Reeves selected Doug Johnson as the starting quarterback for the
Atlanta Falcons' game against the New York Giants on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Vick was optimistic after receiving treatment on his sprained
right shoulder before lunch, but the pain worsened in passing drills.
He shut himself down after 45 minutes of the two-hour workout.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't getting any better, so I just quit throwing," Vick
said. "It was starting to feel less stiff as practice wore on, but it
kind of got sore again. I'm going to give it a night of rest and try
to throw tomorrow, but I probably won't play this weekend."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland Brown safety Robert Griffith will be sidelined four to
six weeks because of a broken bone in his right shoulder, the latest
blow to a secondary that could be missing three starters Sunday
against Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Corey Fuller and safety Devin Bush are also nursing
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith initially hurt his shoulder while tackling Tennessee's
Eddie George in Week 3.</TE>
<TE>   He said he underwent his third MRI exam in three weeks on Monday,
but nothing unusual was detected. Only after the nine-year veteran
had a CT scan performed did doctors discover a hairline fracture in
his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Carlos Hall, the Tennessee Titans' first-round draft
pick who replaced injured Jevon Kearse as a starter, is expected to
miss three weeks after surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right
knee.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, we will have a bye week, and he will not miss too
much time," Coach Jeff Fisher said. "He potentially will miss two
games if he can't get back after the bye, but he has worked hard."</TE>

<HD>Giants Making Long Story Short</HD>
<DH>Game 2: Aurilia hits two homers and Schmidt provides strong
pitching in 4-1 victory for 2-0 edge.</DH>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Cardinals solved one of baseball's great mysteries
Thursday night: how to pitch effectively to Barry Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   The game's greatest slugger struck out twice, flied out and
walked.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for the Cardinals, they didn't have a clue how to
solve a new problem: the resurgence of Bonds' teammate, shortstop
Rich Aurilia, whose May elbow surgery had left him punchless and
powerless for more than half the season.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday night, Aurilia stepped back into character and, for at
least one night, into Bonds' big shoes, slugging two home runs to
back the superlative pitching of Jason Schmidt and lead the San
Francisco Giants to a 4-1 victory in front of 52,195 and a seemingly
commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven National League championship
series.</TE>
<TE>   The scene now moves to San Francisco for Games 3, 4 and 5
Saturday, Sunday and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "No way is this series over. If it is, we should just stay here,"
said Woody Williams, the St. Louis right-hander who returned from a
pulled rib muscle to go six innings in the losing effort.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen teams have fallen behind, 2-0, in the league championship
series and only two have come back to win. One of those teams was the
1985 Cardinals, who beat the Dodgers. The other was the 1984 San
Diego Padres, who came back against the Chicago Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   Aurilia, who dropped from 37 home runs in 2001 to 15 this season
because of the injury, homered both times off Williams, in the first
inning with the bases empty and in the fifth with a man aboard, the
two balls landing close to the same spot in left-center.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me the same guy got both of them," Aurilia said with a
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Those three runs held up for much of the night because of Schmidt
and solid Giant defense. Schmidt went 7 2/3 innings, holding the
Cardinals to a run and four hits. He struck out eight and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   "Which is better, excellent or outstanding?" Cardinal Manager Tony
La Russa asked reporters. "Woody was outstanding, but Schmidt was
excellent."</TE>
<TE>   Aurilia was just as impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just an overpowering performance," Aurilia said, "one of
the best performances I've seen one of our pitchers throw all year."</TE>
<TE>   You couldn't tell from how he warmed up in the bullpen, according
to Schmidt.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually don't go off my performance in the bullpen," he said,
"because it's usually terrible. If I went off that, I wouldn't throw
a strike."</TE>
<TE>   Yet as overpowering as Schmidt was at times, the tone of the game
might have been different had it not been for a key play in the third
inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals, trailing, 1-0, had runners at second and third when
Fernando Vina lifted a fly ball to shallow center. J.D. Drew tested
Kenny Lofton's arm and tried to score, but the throw was there and
Giant catcher Benito Santiago made the tag to keep the Cardinals off
the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   "That was actually a play I almost forgot about," Schmidt said
afterward in the euphoria of victory. "That might have been the play
of the game right there."</TE>
<TE>   Although he had thrown 119 pitches, Schmidt seemed to be cruising
when he struck out Mike Matheny for the second out in the eighth
inning and his third consecutive strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   But then Eduardo Perez, pinch-hitting, homered to left and Manager
Dusty Baker took the ball out of Schmidt's talented right hand.</TE>
<TE>   After reliever Scott Eyre gave up a single to Vina, Baker went to
his closer, Robb Nen, who has had more than 40 saves in four of his
last five seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Nen got out of the inning when Ramon Martinez, in for Aurilia,
narrowly missed a collision with teammate Jeff Kent after fielding a
ground ball, managing to touch second for the force as the sliding
Vina slammed into Martinez' left leg.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants added a run in the ninth. J.T. Snow tripled and came
home on a squeeze bunt by Martinez, yelling, "Way to play the game,"
as he crossed home plate.</TE>
<TE>   How long has it been since Baker last called for a squeeze?</TE>
<TE>   "Can't remember," Baker said. "Probably five years. It will
probably be another five years before we do another one."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom of the ninth began ominously for the Giants when Jim
Edmonds' fly ball down the left-field line popped out of Bonds'
glove, Edmonds winding up at second.</TE>
<TE>   But Nen retired the next three Cardinals. Edgar Renteria was
retired on a ground ball to short for the final out. He dove
headfirst into first base in a futile attempt to beat the throw.</TE>
<TE>   And as the rest of the players trotted off the field, there
Renteria stayed, head down, a fitting symbol for a team whose heads
figure to be down all the way to San Francisco.</TE>

<LD>You could argue all day about politics, paper versus plastic, or even
what's up with Ted Danson's hair, but there is no debate on this:</LD>
<LD>   Oregon is the Pacific 10 Conference's model football program and
has been for years.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon has won more games than any other conference school since
1995, is coming off consecutive league titles, won 11 games last year
for the first time in school history, should have played Miami in the
Rose Bowl for the national title and has done it all without having
to hold a news conference to go over the coach's transgressions with
the NCAA (not to mention any names, Rick Neuheisel).</LD>
<TE>   Oregon has reached that glorious program point where it gets
credit just for showing up, which explains how this season's 5-0
squad, which has yet to defeat a ranked opponent, starts Saturday's
game at UCLA with a top-10 national ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Football powers such as Nebraska and Penn State have enjoyed this
status for years.</TE>
<TE>   "If this happened five or six years ago, there's no way we would
be ranked in the top 10," Duck Coach Mike Bellotti acknowledged  this
week. "It's not just a testament to what Oregon has done, it's a
testament to where the Pac-10 is nowadays."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's web print is all over the Pac-10. Four of the league's 10
coaches are former Oregon offensive coordinators--Bellotti, UCLA's
Bob Toledo, California's Jeff Tedford and Arizona State's Dirk
Koetter.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, this uprising out of Eugene borders on mind-boggling,
when you consider that Oregon once went 37 years between conference
titles.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Oregon was famous for producing scores of assistant
coaches who went on to become head coaches who beat Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   The school has yet to earn its national championship in football,
yet provided the incubator for several bright young coaching minds.
John McKay left the Oregon staff and led USC to four national titles.
John Robinson tutored in Eugene, followed McKay to USC and won a
piece of his own national crown.</TE>
<TE>   George Seifert, who later coached the San Francisco 49ers to two
Super Bowl titles, was an Oregon assistant from 1967-71.</TE>
<TE>   And what about close calls?</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Snyder, Oregon staff 1967-71, led Cal to a 10-victory season
and nearly led Arizona State to the national title in 1996, and
Toledo, an Oregon assistant in the 1980s, came close to delivering
the goods for UCLA in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   What gives?</TE>
<TE>   "It's the Willamette [River] water," Toledo joked this week. "John
McKay used to drink it with his vodka and so did Robinson, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Toledo described Oregon as "kind of the cradle of coaching on the
West Coast. I thought Pacific was for a while when I was there, but
it's actually Oregon."</TE>
<TE>   Young coaches flocked to Oregon for apprenticeships but never saw
it as a final destination.</TE>
<TE>   It was only after the player talent started to rise in the 1980s
and '90s that Oregon was able to develop coaches and champions.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Brooks, Oregon's coach from 1977 through 1994, gets credit
for steadily upgrading the product in Eugene. After Brooks took
Oregon to the Rose Bowl in the 1994 season, he left to coach the
Rams. Bellotti then took the Ducks to unprecedented heights.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Toledo thinks the most important cog in Oregon's turnaround
toils in the shoe business.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo remembers going to the 1995 Rose Bowl to watch his friend,
Brooks, lead the Ducks against Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'They just can't maintain this thing,' " Toledo said.
"It's a credit to them and to the best owner in college football,
Phil Knight."</TE>
<TE>   Ouch.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, of course, is a co-founder of Nike, based in Beaverton,
and a huge Oregon donor.</TE>
<TE>   "He's done a great job with those facilities," Toledo said. "They
get a new toy every day, from what I hear."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, the infusion of money has allowed Oregon to construct
state-of-the-art facilities and to plaster posters of its players in
Manhattan. Top players, who once would never have considered Oregon,
if only because of the weather, are now taking the program seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Lousy weather? No problem. In 1998, Oregon cut ribbon on the
$15-million Moshofsky Center, an indoor practice facility, and this
year the school put the finishing touches on a $90-million expansion
of Autzen Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Oregon has had what amounts to kids working on
dissertations coaching the offense, a lineage that included Toledo,
Bellotti, Al Borges, Tedford, Koetter and, this year, Andy Ludwig,
last year the offensive coordinator at Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   "They kept the best of all those coordinators in that package,"
said Koetter, Oregon's offensive coordinator in 1996-97. "They have
some really good stuff, and now they have some outstanding players to
go on top of their good scheme."</TE>
<TE>   Although Oregon continues as a steppingstone for coaches, the
difference now is, the hometown team is also reaping benefits.</TE>
<TE>   When Bellotti lost Tedford this year to Cal, he was inundated with
resumes.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of applicants, when I've had positions lately,
certainly improved dramatically," Bellotti said. "For our last
offensive coordinator's job, I had a former Pac-10 head coach and an
offensive coordinator."</TE>
<TE>   Bellotti ended up hiring Ludwig, who last year mentored
quarterback David Carr at Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   It was a pretty good swap.</TE>
<TE>   Bellotti gave up Tedford, who'd coached Joey Harrington, the No. 3
pick in the NFL draft, for Ludwig, who'd coached Carr, the No. 1
overall pick.</TE>
<TE>   If tradition follows, and Ludwig gets his Ducks in a row, he might
in two or three years become the fifth former Oregon assistant to get
a top job in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   It then might be time to split the league into two divisions:
Pac-5 and the Oregon 5.</TE>

<HD>It's a Small Town, After All</HD>
<DH>In little Webster, Washburn is treated as a favorite son</DH>

<DL>WEBSTER, Wis.</DL>
<LD>October baseball is filled with stories of stolen signs, but none
quite like this.</LD>
<LD>   At the woodsy edge of this 660-person town that produced the
Angels' best starting pitcher, there is a marker that speaks to the
amazement of it all.</LD>
<LD>   It is adorned with a painting of a generic left-handed pitcher in
a blank uniform.</LD>
<TE>   Next to the painting are the words, "Home of Jarrod Washburn, 1992
Webster Graduate, Professional Baseball Pitcher."</TE>
<TE>   A simple exercise in civic pride, certainly. Except, when the sign
was commissioned several years ago, while Washburn was still a minor
league pitcher, there was a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry, I didn't know he was left-handed; nobody ever told
me," said Joe Connor, the artist who doubles as a mechanic at his
family's gas station down the street.</TE>
<TE>   That sign, featuring a right-handed Washburn, was destroyed.
Connor drew another one, a lefty. But shortly after it was stuck into
the ground, somebody stole it.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder if some people were mad that we were giving this kid
special treatment when he hadn't really done anything yet," Connor
said.</TE>
<TE>   He shrugged, put down his wrenches, picked up his brushes and
painted a third sign.</TE>
<TE>   It was stolen too.</TE>
<TE>   "Little jokesters must have thought they were real funny," said
Kim Johnson, school district accountant.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the crime still unsolved, a fourth sign was painted and
hammered down.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in this brilliant but harsh land where everything must be
earned, something dramatic happened.</TE>
<TE>   The sign stuck. The little jokesters left it alone.</TE>
<TE>   It's still there today.</TE>
<TE>   "And I know what you're thinking," said Kelly Carlson, who owns
the nearby carpet and tile store with her husband. "You're thinking,
'Holy moly.' "</TE>
<TE>   Something like that.</TE>
<TE>   A likeness of a Southland hero planted at the edge of a town with
no stoplights?</TE>
<TE>   A painting of a man who has thrilled millions guarding a community
consisting of two blocks?</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn will be on the mound for the Angels at Edison
Field tonight in tiebreaking Game 3 of the American League
championship series against the Minnesota Twins</TE>
<TE>   But, holy moly, part of him will still be here in the northwest
Wisconsin forest, standing sturdy in a hometown that had as much
chance of producing a major league player as the Angels once had of
winning the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "It is amazing," said his father Mike, sitting across a wooden
table, sipping coffee one recent morning in one of two diners in
town. "We didn't know how good he was. We didn't know what good was."</TE>
<TE>   Good, today, is being the left-handed ace of what has become
baseball's most exciting team.</TE>
<TE>   Good is being the team's best starting pitcher in a decade, winner
of 18 games during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Good was fashioning a dozen-game winning streak, the longest in
the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Good was winning the clinching game in the division series against
the New York Yankees last weekend, giving up only one earned run in
five innings, despite being exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   But back then?</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in a modest lakeside home nestled in the trees nearly
nine miles from the center of town, Washburn, now 28, understood a
different definition of the word.</TE>
<TE>   Good was learning to pitch off mounds as high as coffee tables, in
ballparks with dirt infields and tree-studded foul lines, during
seasons that were short and obscure.</TE>
<TE>   Good was learning to hit by batting golf balls into the lake
behind his home.</TE>
<TE>   Good, for his father, was recently noticing that one of those golf
balls had washed ashore.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'That ball must have been on the bottom of that lake
for more than 10 years,' " Mike said. "Talk about full circle."</TE>
<TE>   So it has been for his son, who, with more than his distinct
northern Midwest accent and scruffy beard, carries the town with him
like a shield.</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't matter where I go," Washburn said. "I'm never leaving
there."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone talks about how well he pitches under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   But to him, pressure is accidentally skidding your old car into a
remote ditch on the way to an important high school baseball game.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember he called me and said, 'Dad, I wrecked the car; it's
in a ditch. I just left it and walked to the game,' " Mike recalled.
"I said, 'Well, OK.' "</TE>
<TE>   Everyone talks about how Washburn never seems scared.</TE>
<TE>   But to him, fear was boarding an airplane for the first time when
he was 20.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me how Jarrod has adjusted," said teammate and friend
Scott Schoeneweis. "I tell them, 'Compared to that first plane ride,
I don't see how anything else would be a big deal.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To examine Jarrod Washburn's roots, one needs only to look at his
father's cap.</TE>
<TE>   A red Angel cap, it is stained black around the rim and visor.</TE>
<TE>   Mike is a machinist at the town's only factory. He wears that cap
every day to work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's simple stuff here," Mike said. "You get a job, you raise a
family, you build a home, you take care of things."</TE>
<TE>   And you never really think your child will become a professional
athlete.</TE>
<TE>   It just doesn't happen here. At least, it never had.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, how does anybody find it?</TE>
<TE>   About a two-hour drive northeast of Minneapolis, Webster is in a
different world.</TE>
<TE>   Cross the St. Croix River into Wisconsin, drive through Alpha and
Falun, make a left turn at Siren, then disappear into the trees.</TE>
<TE>   When Washburn was growing up here, the nearest mall was 65 miles
away. The nearest movie theater was 30 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn's parents are among the many here who do not have cell
phones, because cell phones don't work in these woods.</TE>
<TE>   Neither does pretension.</TE>
<TE>   There is a reason that last season, Washburn was the only Angel
who criticized the club's constant promotion of the Rally Monkey.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't go much for that sort of stuff around here," Mike said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Washburn's parents have a Rally Monkey wrapped around the
base of a family-room lamp, they don't actually use it.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't go shaking it or waving it or anything like that," said
Mike.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn's parents have a standing invitation to attend playoff
games--Jarrod even called last week and told them he was one computer
click from putting them on a plane for the weekend Yankee series.</TE>
<TE>   But, although they visited him at several ballparks, including
Edison, during the year, they turned him down.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, thanks, but don't push that button," Mike said. "I
can actually see the game better on my big TV. Instant replays and
all that. Nobody standing in front of you pounding a balloon."</TE>
<TE>   That down-to-earth attitude makes it even more amazing that the
rest of the world found his son.</TE>
<TE>   "He always played ball; we always rooted for him. We don't see
anything different now," said his mother Dawn, a bank teller.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, though, a couple of things happened.</TE>
<TE>   First, there was the videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Helland, Washburn's coach at Webster High, knew that the
baseball star of his 28-person senior class was something special.</TE>
<TE>   But he also knew that because of the weather, which limited the
team to a summer season that began after baseball's annual draft day,
virtually no scouts would find him.</TE>
<TE>   This was a kid who was so gifted, his childhood friends wouldn't
let him play unless he did it right-handed.</TE>
<TE>   This was a kid who became such a feared youth league hitter, he
was once intentionally walked 14 consecutive times.</TE>
<TE>   Once he reached high school, this was a kid who once struck out
the first three hitters of a game on nine consecutive strikes,
prompting the umpire to turn to Helland and say, "I've never seen
that before."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody in these parts had, so one winter day during Washburn's
senior year, Helland hustled him into the gym with his catcher and
brother Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   With a hand-held video camera, Helland ordered Washburn to start
pitching.</TE>
<TE>   He sent the videotape to the coach at the University of Wisconsin
Oshkosh, Tom Lechnir, who immediately wanted to recruit him.</TE>
<TE>   But because baseball season didn't start for months, Lechnir drove
up to watch him play ... basketball?</TE>
<TE>   Washburn made 18 free throws that night, and the coach was
convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "Wanted him to play baseball for him but had never seen him pitch
in person," Mike said with a smile. "I guess it was those pressure
free throws that did it."</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, his parents heard his name being announced on
something other than a scratchy public-address system for the first
time when the radio blared that he had been taken in the second round
of the draft.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years after that, the women were pausing between frames at
the town's four-lane bowling alley Tuesday to stare at the old TV as
Washburn's team battled for the American League pennant.</TE>
<TE>   "After Jarrod, the second-most famous person in this town is ... I
have no idea," said bowler Vicki Tolander, although she may fill the
bill after her recent 528 series.</TE>
<TE>   On the verge of taking his team to its first World Series,
Washburn is embedded here in the tiniest of worlds.</TE>
<TE>   Remember when he would ride his bike to youth league games, the
nine-mile country trip punctuated by a dip in the Yellow River?</TE>
<TE>   Remember the time he got such a bad case of poison ivy, the
doctors gave him a shot of steroids? And in that day's high school
game, he hit two home runs and had six RBIs?</TE>
<TE>   Folks also remember how, earlier this year, Washburn's name was
leaked in unproven allegations of sexual assault.</TE>
<TE>   They just don't talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   "We know Jarrod, we knew it didn't make any sense, we knew it
would be proven wrong, so nobody ever said a word," said Bev Johnson,
one of his former grade-school teachers. "We all figured the woman
got paid to say what she said."</TE>
<TE>   It is all good and neighborly here, this place where the only
fast-food joint is closed during the winter and a mini-mart
advertises bait leeches.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Carlson has put Washburn's name on the marquee outside her
carpet and tile store, not only for Jarrod but, "for his parents, who
drive by here every day, so they can see it."</TE>
<TE>   Al Steiner, a machinist who also happens to be the mayor, is
thinking about a "Jarrod Washburn Day" if the Angels continue to
advance. It's not like Washburn won't be here. He lives in a house
with his wife and son here during the winter, and just bought 160
acres nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty much removed up here to be Angel fans," Steiner
said. "But you look around here lately and you see a bunch of red
caps."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they are black around the edges. Maybe they are worn
backward while the wearer is driving a tractor. Maybe they are
changed for orange or camouflage caps on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   They are red caps nonetheless, dotting the pines and birches like
yellow ribbons as folks watch grandiose October baseball for a
glimpse of a neighbor. In a small town leaving the light on.</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A WITH GARY BETTMAN</KH>
<HD>Labor Changes Sought Despite Revenue Growth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Gary Bettman was elected the NHL's first commissioner in
December 1992, the league has undergone astonishing changes.</LD>
<LD>   On the business side, Bettman has helped attract national TV
coverage and major national advertisers, raising the NHL's gross
revenues to about $1.9 billion. With the hard-won backing of owners,
he oversaw the participation of NHL players in the Winter Olympics,
building a 17-day break into the schedule to accommodate the 1998
Nagano Games and a 12-day break for the Salt Lake City Games earlier
this year.</LD>
<LD>   In the last decade, the NHL has grown to 30 teams, many in
nontraditional cities such as Tampa, Nashville, Dallas and Anaheim.
Announced attendance has set a record for average (16,760) for four
consecutive seasons and has surpassed 20 million each of the last two
seasons. Eleven teams played to 99% or more of their capacity last
season, boosting the league average to 91%</LD>
<TE>   Before participating in the retirement of Wayne Gretzky's King
jersey Wednesday at Staples Center, Bettman addressed a wide range of
issues during a meeting with Times reporters and editors:</TE>
<TE>   Question: The Walt Disney Co. has retained a New York investment
bank to sell the Mighty Ducks. What is your understanding of where
that stands?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I don't think there's a real anxious desire on their part
to sell the club. They want to make sure whatever happens, the team
is playing in Anaheim. I haven't been told there's any immediacy on
their part.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Would it be a blow to lose Disney as an owner, because Disney
was hailed as a new corporate owner when the Ducks and Florida joined
the league?</TE>
<TE>   A: I am more than comfortable with the ownership of the Mighty
Ducks. We'll see what happens. I hope they never sell but if they do,
it will be for reasons less to do with sports than other imperatives.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your league is the next one to deal with labor and collective
bargaining [its labor agreement expires Sept. 15, 2004]. This is a
major deal for you. How are you approaching it?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have had phenomenal revenue growth, but as fast as we've
been able to grow revenues, salaries have grown even faster. This has
resulted in two forms of disparities. The first is the disparity
between revenues and salaries. The other is the disparity among teams
in terms of what they can afford to spend, and that disparity, as in
all sports, is exacerbated by big-market/small-market [issues], and
in our case it gets even more exacerbated because of our Canadian
franchises and the currency issue.</TE>
<TE>   We as a league, by the time we get to 2004, will have operated
under this [collective bargaining agreement] for 10 years, a good
period of labor peace. And in many ways, we have been able to grow
the league, but it has led to these other problems. We need a
fundamental change in the economics of our game. And the underlying
principles of that change, which is something I and all our governors
of all our clubs are fully supportive of, is, we need a program of
cost containment so we can control our costs relative to revenues
such that all our teams can be competitive and economically healthy.
And we want that to be applicable where all our franchises are
currently located.</TE>
<TE>   We are not interested in relocation. We are not interested in
contraction.</TE>
<TE>   We believe that with the right economic system, all of our clubs
will be fine, and that's something we're committed to. I am on the
record as requesting the players' association to begin the dialogue
as soon as possible. This goes back many months now, because I think
the problems will get worse over time until 2004. And the worse they
get, and the longer we take to address them, the harder it will be to
fix--but they have to be fixed.</TE>
<TE>   The union's response is, they like the status quo and they're not
interested in talking about changing right now. That is their legal
prerogative. That doesn't mean I think it's the right thing or a good
thing but it is their legal prerogative.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does your model include subsidizing small-market teams through
revenue sharing?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't believe in revenue sharing in a vacuum. I happen to
believe that when you have an inflationary system or revenue sharing
without a cost certainty, there is actually more inflation. It simply
spreads around the problem, it doesn't fix it.</TE>
<TE>   I also believe players are entitled to be fairly compensated and
they're entitled to share fairly in the growth of the league. This is
not an anti-player campaign. This is about getting an economic model
that works, because in the final analysis, if we don't have the right
economic model, it's not good for the fans. All your fans, on Day 1
of the season ... should have hope and optimism that their team has
as much chance as any other team to win. And that's what we have to
get to.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What would be the consequence if you didn't get a model you
could live with?</TE>
<TE>   A: Nothing good. Which is why we're committed to this. If my
choice is short-term pain or bleeding to death over time, we will
take the short-term pain.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When Bud [Selig, commissioner of baseball] was here before they
reached their labor agreement, he told us if they didn't get a deal
they could live with, they would lose six to eight teams. Could you
be specific like that?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't envision a scenario where we don't fix the problem when
we have the opportunity to do so. I view 2004 as the opportunity to
get this right and fix it. I don't want to speculate about what would
happen if we didn't, because I'm committed to getting it fixed, but
it wouldn't be good.... I'm not interested in just having the
Canadian franchises merely survive, I want them to be fully
competitive and healthy. We owe it to all our fans to ensure all our
teams can be healthy and competitive.</TE>

<KH>TV-RADIO LARRY STEWART</KH>
<HD>Enberg's Heart Is With Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of frustration, these are sweet times for longtime Angel
fans. Count Dick Enberg among them.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just one of hundreds of thousands who are on an emotional
high right now," he said Thursday from his home in La Jolla.</LD>
<LD>   Enberg is also one of 21 radio announcers the Angels have had in
their 42-year history. But he is No. 1 in stature.</LD>
<TE>   He was the Angels' lead announcer from 1969-78 before going on to
network fame.</TE>
<TE>   "In my days, it was, 'Tanana and Ryan, then three days of cryin','
" he said. "The Angels seemed to have a knack for finding last place
and staying there."</TE>
<TE>   But Enberg has fond memories, particularly the six
seasons--1973-78--he worked with Don Drysdale.</TE>
<TE>   "Big D made it fun to come to work, even in August and September
when you knew there'd be less than 15,000 people in the stands," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed Don never had a bad day."</TE>
<TE>   Enberg will be in Tampa this weekend, calling a game between the
Buccaneers and Cleveland Browns for CBS on Sunday. But he'll have an
eye on a television set today and Saturday, watching his beloved
Angels as much as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this," he said, "if the Angels make it to the World
Series, somehow I'm going to find a way to get to a game."</TE>
<TE>   It would sure be fitting for Enberg to join radio announcers Rory
Markas and Terry Smith for at least an inning or two in the booth.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to intrude," Enberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, no one would consider it an intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love it," Markas said.</TE>
<TE>   Good Timing</TE>
<TE>   What a year for Markas and Smith to break in with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   For Markas, a native Southern Californian who has held a variety
of sports broadcasting jobs in this area, becoming the Angels' lead
radio announcer is a dream come true.</TE>
<TE>   And Smith hit the big time after toiling in Columbus, Ohio, where
he did triple-A baseball for 19 seasons after also spending some time
as the radio voice of Ohio State football and basketball. Rex Hudler,
who once played in Columbus, recommended Smith for the No. 2
announcing job.</TE>
<TE>   Markas grew up in Northridge, rooting for the Angels because his
father did. And he dreamed about someday announcing baseball, the
sport he loved and the sport he played at Chatsworth High.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a kid and would play catch by myself by throwing the
ball up against the garage, I'd call an imaginary game in my head,"
he recalled. "Being a major league baseball announcer is what I
dreamed about."</TE>
<TE>   Now, he is in his first season as an announcer for the team he
rooted for as a kid. And that team is now within reach of its first
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "How does it get any better than this?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Markas, who said he plans to continue as the radio play-by-play
announcer for USC basketball, has certainly rebounded since he was
fired by the Clippers in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Markas said he was pretty down after that. He said a surprise call
from Chick Hearn helped lift his spirits. Markas also said Hearn was
instrumental in helping him land the USC job.</TE>
<TE>   More Good Timing</TE>
<TE>   Getting the Angels next season looked like a good deal for KSPN
(1110) when it was announced last month. Now it looks like a great
deal.</TE>
<TE>   It should also benefit the Angels, who are moving from KLAC (570),
which features general talk, to an all-sports station that is part of
the ESPN Radio family.</TE>
<TE>   And KSPN at the end of the year is going to 710 on the dial, a
stronger and more familiar frequency--the same one longtime Angel
flagship station KMPC used to have.</TE>
<TE>   Markas and Smith will continue as the Angels' radio announcers.</TE>
<TE>   There at the Start</TE>
<TE>   Don Wells, a member of the Angels' original broadcast team who
died last week at 79, is remembered as a talented announcer. But his
12-year career with the Angels ended badly.</TE>
<TE>   Wells was the lead announcer on a team that also included Bob
Kelley and Steve Bailey in 1961, the Angels' first year of existence.
Buddy Blattner joined Wells the next season, and they made up a
two-man team until 1968.</TE>
<TE>   When Blattner left for Kansas City, Enberg, who had been doing the
pre- and postgame shows for three years, was moved into the lead
spot. Then after one season, Wells' role was reduced further when
Dave Neihaus was brought in.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1972 season, his third with Enberg and Neihaus, Wells
left the team and ended up working as a reporter for KFWB (980) until
1988. He became something of a recluse and later moved to Switzerland
to be with his son, who had married a Swiss woman.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings Game</TE>
<TE>   Of the four markets with teams in the playoffs, Los Angeles placed
fourth in the ratings Wednesday night. Fox's coverage got a 34.5
rating with a 52 share in Minneapolis, a 29.3/41 in St. Louis, a
20.8/35 in San Francisco and an 18.0/31 in L.A..</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, Fox, which televised both games to different parts of
the country, averaged an 8.2/14 with an audience of 12.2 million
viewers--midweek highs for Fox's second-round coverage. Through the
first two days of the second round, Fox's ratings were up 37% from
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite competition from Tuesday night's Angel game, Channel 9 got
an impressive 4.7/7 for the Lakers' exhibition game against the
Clippers at Bakersfield. That's a 47% increase over the Lakers' first
exhibition telecast last year. The Laker rating went to a 7.0 once
the Angel game ended.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Television and sports executives discussed the future of NFL
Sunday Ticket at an industry event in New York this week. The
consensus was, the package will remain exclusively with DirecTV until
the current television deal expires after the 2005 season.... Bob
Myers, after two seasons, will not return as the radio commentator
for UCLA basketball this season. Myers works for agent Arn Tellem and
school officials were concerned about appearances. UCLA spokesman
Marc Dellins said Myers had done nothing wrong. Don MacLean and Sean
Farnham are the leading candidates to replace Myers.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad Rashad will be part of the NBA coverage on ESPN and ABC this
season.... Telemundo's NBA schedule of 15 weekend telecasts beginning
Nov. 10 will involve the Lakers once and the Clippers three times.
Could that mean that the Clippers are considered more popular among
Spanish-speaking viewers? ... ESPN is expanding its Sunday night
"SportsCenter" to 90 minutes, beginning this weekend.... ESPN begins
its Professional Bowlers Assn. coverage Sunday at 10 a.m. All 20 PBA
tournaments will be televised over a 22-week span.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Marge Hearn looked elegant while being interviewed live via
satellite from her home in Encino during halftime of the Lakers'
exhibition game against the Clippers at Bakersfield Tuesday night.
She also came up with a great line.</TE>
<TE>   "With two Samakis on the team [Samaki Walker and Soumaila Samake],
I'm not sure how Chick would have handled that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Chick's wit no doubt rubbed off on his wife, or maybe it
was the other way around.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disappointed in rookie right fielder Michael Cuddyer, Minnesota
Manager Ron Gardenhire might make a lineup change tonight for Game 3
of the American League championship series.</LD>
<LD>   Cuddyer misplayed two balls Wednesday at the Metrodome,
contributing to a 6-3 loss to the Angels that evened the
best-of-seven series, 1-1, and prompting Gardenhire to consider his
options.</LD>
<LD>   "I was a little disappointed," the first-year manager said at
Thursday's workout. "Whether he lost them in the ceiling or whatever,
I thought he looked a little tentative, so I'm thinking about that
one.</LD>
<TE>   "I've got a couple of other guys out there that need some playing
time and should get in there. I can go that way."</TE>
<TE>   Dustan Mohr is considered the Twins' best defensive right fielder.
Switch-hitter Bobby Kielty is another candidate, but using him in
that role would reduce Gardenhire's pinch-hitting options, weakening
the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, it appears Cuddyer could be the odd man out at the
moment.</TE>
<TE>   "This kid's played very well for us during the course of the
playoffs and hit the ball very well for us," Gardenhire said of the
club's 1997 first-round draft choice. "But like I said, I wasn't
happy with the tentativeness that he chased those balls with."</TE>
<TE>   In the Angels' three-run second, Cuddyer was hesitant on Scott
Spiezio's run-scoring double inches inside the right-field line. He
also got a late break on Troy Glaus' one-out triple to right in the
sixth, which was followed by Brad Fullmer's two-run home run.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't happy with the way he attacked them," Gardenhire said.
"I'm worried about that a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Twins have plans for the Rally Monkey.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to kidnap that little monkey," center fielder Torii
Hunter said, jokingly. "You know how they kidnap mascots? I'm going
to kidnap that monkey. I'm going to kidnap him so I can learn from
him. If we can just get a hold of that monkey, I think we've got a
chance."</TE>
<TE>   The Rally Monkey is a source of amusement in the Minnesota
clubhouse, as well as throughout baseball, and Hunter finds the
gimmick especially funny.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know about the other guys but I like the Rally Monkey;
he's cool," Hunter said. "I wish I could meet him and get his
autograph.</TE>
<TE>   "There was one time when he put the jinx on us ... he's the truth.
And he's a ladies' monkey too. The Homer Hankie is powerful, but the
monkey is alive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Metrodome's hard artificial surface, fielder-unfriendly roof
and noisy fans helped the Twins go 8-0 there in winning World Series
titles in 1987 and 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Those clubs were 0-6 on the road in the World Series, but this
edition enjoys life outside, going 2-1 at Network Associates Coliseum
in upsetting the Oakland Athletics in the best-of-five division
series.</TE>
<TE>   The AL Central champions are 2-2 in the postseason at the
Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of confidence no matter where we play," said
right-hander Brad Radke, scheduled to start Game 4. "It's nice to
play at home, but we haven't really played that well at home yet in
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We did play some good games on the road in Oakland. We went up
there and did a good job, and hopefully we'll play some more good
road games here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Backup catcher Tom Prince was with the Dodgers when they were
swept in the 1995 and '96 National League division series by the
Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "We had good clubs with the Dodgers," said Prince, who joined the
Twins last season and batted .224 in 51 games this season, "but
things just didn't work out."</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Bohlander Has Extra Incentive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tackle Bryce Bohlander thought he took everything with him when he
left his hometown of Keizer, Ore., to return to UCLA in the fall.
Turns out he left a piece of his heart.</LD>
<LD>   Bohlander, a senior three-year starter, struck up a friendship
with Chris Holt, a 13-year-old Keizer boy who was rushed to the
hospital and diagnosed with Leukemia a day after pitching in a Little
League game last spring.</LD>
<LD>   Holt loved Oregon State and Oregon, at least until Bohlander put a
UCLA cap on his head and sat in the hospital during his radiation
treatments.</LD>
<TE>   Before UCLA visited Oregon State last week, Bohlander wrote Holt a
letter dedicating the game to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you are feeling better and I know you are disappointed
because you can't play football this year," Bohlander wrote. "But you
have the rest of your life to play football. Your job right now is to
get well.</TE>
<TE>   "I will dedicate every play and every move to you, Chris. Since
you can't play, I'll play for you."</TE>
<TE>   Bohlander had one of the best games of his career in the Bruins'
43-35 victory.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA plays host to Oregon this week, but Holt is pulling for the
Bruins. And in the more important battle, Holt's cancer is in
remission. He had a bone marrow transplant, using his 10-year-old
brother as a donor, and hopes to return to school and athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Sherie Farrell, Holt's aunt and a lifelong friend of the
Bohlanders, believes that her nephew is richer for having met the
UCLA tackle.</TE>
<TE>   "Bryce is a good football player and a good student, but he is a
great person," she said. "Chris is so proud to know him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Free safety Ben Emanuel told Coach Bob Toledo on Thursday that the
pinched nerve in his neck that has kept him from practicing this week
is too painful for him to play Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Jibril Raymo will replace Emanuel, whose rapid development allowed
Matt Ware to move from safety to cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said Ware would return to free safety if Raymo struggles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA can only hope defensive tackle Ryan Boschetti plays as well
in his first start as Oregon's Haloti Ngata did last week. Boschetti,
a junior college transfer, replaces the Outland Trophy candidate
Rodney Leisle, who had foot surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Ngata, a 6-foot-4, 324-pound freshman, had a strong impact in the
Ducks' 31-14 victory over Arizona and will be as difficult to budge
from the lineup as he is from the line of scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "Haloti has great maturity, and we knew that, but it's not just
physical maturity, he's mentally tough," Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He does some things in terms of getting off of blocks that are
amazing. He's a big man and he can run and handle that body."</TE>

<HD>Grootegoed Has Point to Prove</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Linebacker Matt Grootegoed intends not only to help USC defeat
California on Saturday but to be around for the entire game.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Grootegoed suffered a season-ending broken leg in the
second quarter against the Golden Bears in USC's 55-14 rout at
Berkeley. Grootegoed was injured as he tried to stop tailback Terrell
Williams.</LD>
<LD>   "I was blitzing and his leg hit my knee," Grootegoed said
Thursday. "I thought it was just a bone bruise or something. Then I
tried to get up, and that wasn't happening.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to show them I'm back."</TE>
<TE>   Grootegoed is second on the team with 29 tackles, among them five
for losses totaling 28 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal is fourth in the nation in turnover margin at plus-13 and has
scored 70 points off turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan quarterback Carson Palmer said Coach Pete Carroll is well
aware of the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really been stressing that we have to make them drop the
ball and throw picks, and we have to hold on it and not make
mistakes," said Palmer, who has had four passes intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Safety Troy Polamalu did not practice because of a high ankle
sprain, but he said he would probably play in some capacity Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu tracked the defense and made suggestions to teammates
during drills.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Carroll says, 'You're working harder now than you did when
you were healthy,' " Polamalu said. "I'm just trying to stay focused
and prepared as if I'm playing in a game."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Polamalu's status would be a game-time decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still very iffy for him," Carroll said. "We won't know till
we get to the stadium after warmups."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   During a simulated overtime possession at the end of practice,
freshman tackle Winston Justice shoved freshman linebacker Dallas
Sartz after a play and was penalized 15 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a gift showing how they can't lash out and make
statements on their own for whatever reason that penalizes our
football team," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   A few plays after the penalty, Ryan Killeen, who missed two
field-goal attempts and an extra-point try in last week's overtime
defeat against Washington State, kicked a 43-yard field on the last
play of practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Marcell Allmond got some work with the first
unit on kickoff returns.... Senior fullback Chad Pierson sat out most
drills because of a sore left Achilles but said he expected to be
ready to play Saturday.... Chicago Cub pitcher Mark Prior, who signed
for $10.5 million after he was drafted out of USC in 2001, strolled
past Howard Jones Field as practice began. Prior said he is taking
two classes this semester and is close to finishing a business
degree.</TE>
