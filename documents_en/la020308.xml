<HD>An Intimate Look at the Writer's Life</HD>
<DH>Arliss Howard directs and stars in 'Big Bad Love,' a brave
and admirable portrayal of an author on the brink.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Big Bad Love" is a calculated risk that succeeds in evoking what it
means to be a fiction writer as few films have. Shot through with
beauty, pain and humor, this complex and intimate film is drawn from
the short story collection of the same name by Mississippi writer
Larry Brown. It stars Arliss Howard as Brown alter ego Leon Barlow.</LD>
<LD>   This deeply felt, affecting film is a family affair: Howard also
directed and collaborated on the script with his younger brother
James, and Arliss Howard's wife, Debra Winger, co-stars and served as
producer.</LD>
<LD>   Shot on location in Holly Springs, Miss., by the gifted
cinematographer Paul Ryan, "Big Bad Love" unfolds in a verdant
community of comfortable old homes with lots of space around them. In
this sleepy place past, present and future seem to flow easily among
one another. No one senses this more acutely than Leon, who in
writing fiction draws upon the memories, dreams and imaginings
through which the film threads freely, moving back and forth almost
constantly. "Nothing is real to you except what's in your head," says
Velma (Rosanna Arquette), wife of Leon's best friend and war buddy
Monroe (Paul Le Mat), and in a sense she's right about a man she's
known all her life.</LD>
<TE>   Reality, however, is closing in on Leon, a lean man with a
receding hairline and a rich, poetic Southern sensibility. Leon's
determination to become a writer has already cost him his marriage to
a woman he deeply loves, Marilyn (Winger), a hospital nurse and
mother to their two small children. Leon has custody on the weekends,
and while he's lousy at keeping up with child support payments, he
tells great bedtime stories. So far Leon has faced rejection after
rejection of his work but at last an agent offers appreciation and
encouragement, but how long can he hold out before he and his life
disintegrate completely?</TE>
<TE>   Yet this downward trajectory, fueled by quantities of liquor, is
fodder for Leon's creativity, and it increasingly becomes clear that
he will keep on writing even if it kills him. It is no wonder that
the radiant Marilyn, who clearly still loves Leon as much as he loves
her, has put distance between them. Meanwhile, Leon's mother (Angie
Dickinson), a durably elegant Southern belle, fears that he is as
feckless as her late husband.</TE>
<TE>   Leon's curse of remembering, however, may also prove to be his
blessing. The risk he takes in dedicating himself to writing is
mirrored by the risk the film takes in showing so much through his
eyes--eyes that see the past as sharply and as frequently as the
present.</TE>
<TE>   A film that switches continually and with little warning between
its protagonist's various states of mind makes lots of demands upon
its cast. Even through Leon's bouts of drunkenness, Howard manages to
maintain compassion for Leon, valiant in his struggle and aware of
its cost to others, especially Marilyn, who Winger shows us
ever-shifting between defensiveness, exasperation and love. Fine
ensemble support is supplied by Dickinson, Arquette, Le Mat and
Michael Parks as the philosophical proprietor of the local grocery
and gas station.</TE>
<TE>   "Big Bad Love" is all of a piece, with its soundtrack echoing
every shift in mood and emotion as harmoniously as the camera. It is
an aptly imaginative blend of artists from the legendary Fat Possum
label such as R.L. Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, T-Model Ford, Robert
Belfour, Asie Payton and Kenny Brown. Also heard on the soundtrack
are Tom Waits, who wrote two new songs for the film, Steve Earle, and
a new collaboration between Tom Verlaine and the Kronos Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   "Big Bad Love" is brave and admirable for the trust that it puts
in a viewer's intuition and willingness in going along with it right
through to its rewarding finish.</TE>

<HD>When Politics Upend Family Life</HD>
<DH>'Maryam' focuses on an Iranian American family hit by
backlash against the embassy crisis in 1979. It proves to be a timely
tale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the outset of the absorbing and pertinent "Maryam," the Armins of
suburban New Jersey seem a typical affluent American family, to
themselves and to their neighbors. That Dr. Armin (Shaun Toub), while
loving and good-humored, is stricter than other fathers is the only
apparent trace of his Iranian heritage. His daughter, Mary (Mariam
Parris), born in Iran as Maryam and brought to the U.S. as an infant,
is a beautiful, easygoing high school student, not quite ready to
chafe at her father's restrictions. She feels no connection to her
homeland and has no interest in it either.</LD>
<LD>   All that is about to change, drastically, for the year is 1979. In
the wake of the Islamic revolution, the deposed shah of Iran has
ended up in a Manhattan hospital for treatment of his terminal
cancer--and Armin's nephew Ali (David Ackert) has arrived to stay
while pursuing a college major in physics. Right away, Mary is
unsettled by the arrival of her cousin, a Muslim fundamentalist who
shrinks in horror at her attempt to embrace him in welcome.</LD>
<LD>   Although Ali is fluent in English, he is a stiff, formal man in
the throes of cultural shock. He also carries considerable emotional
baggage because of a family incident in the past, but Armin, as his
sole relative, has extended him traditional Persian hospitality.</LD>
<TE>   The tension Ali's presence creates in the harmonious Armin
household is soon intensified beyond the family's imagining, as
Iranian students storm the U.S. Embassy in Iran, taking prisoners in
protest of the shah's presence in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The prolonged international incident fans Ali's hatred of the shah
while the Armins become targeted for ugly anti-Iranian acts, the same
sort of mindless treatment accorded to countless Americans in the
wake of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   At school, Mary, who previously had never been made to feel
different from her classmates, is shunned and derided. The worsening
situation in turn fuels Mary's desire to assert her independence and
to get the full story about why Ali holds such resentment toward her
father.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian American filmmaker Ramin Serry, in an assured feature
writing and directing debut, has woven his film from actual
experiences of his family and its circle of friends, which gives
"Maryam" its strong sense of having been created from within.</TE>
<TE>   What shines through their ordeal is the Armins' strong, sustaining
sense of family, exemplified by Mary's lovely and wise mother
(Shohreh Aghdashloo), a woman with a mind of her own but also a
shrewd and subtle mediator. Aghdashloo, a distinguished stage
actress, recalls Melina Mercouri in her sultry looks, husky voice and
radiant presence.</TE>
<TE>   Serry proves as adept at directing actors as he is at writing for
them.</TE>
<TE>   Parris, Ackert and Toub give complex, sharply defined portrayals,
with Maziyar Jobrani providing some light relief as a happy-go-lucky
family friend and Victor Jory proving effective as Mary's would-be
boyfriend, a nice kid overwhelmed by all that's happening to Mary and
her family.</TE>
<TE>   "Maryam" is carefully crafted, notably in its deft dramatic
structuring, and has become timely in a way its maker could never
have anticipated.</TE>

<HD>'George' Is Unseen but Widely Heard</HD>
<DH>Film* The off-the-cuff documentary, premiering tonight,
already has the political world abuzz.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>There's only an hour before she has to leave for the airport, and
Alexandra Pelosi is in a hurry, stuffing purple clothes into a
suitcase in her New York apartment and talking at warp speed on two
phones.</LD>
<LD>   She is headed to Austin, Texas, for the debut of her first film, a
75-minute down-home documentary chronicling the 2000 presidential
campaign of George W. Bush--the Bush who roamed the back of the press
plane eating Cheese Doodles, the former prep school cheerleader who
spelled out victory in body letters after an early primary, the
unpredictable orator who urged schoolchildren to "preserve" when he
meant persevere, the unvarnished candidate some of his handlers would
like the nation to forget.</LD>
<LD>   It took a war to erase the image of Bush as a mangler of words and
irredeemable frat boy and turn him into a leader, presidential and
sometimes even eloquent.</LD>
<TE>   But much to the dismay of White House aides, the specter of Bush
past appears to have been resurrected by this 31-year-old San
Francisco-born filmmaker with a $1,000 Sony camcorder she calls "a
piece of crap."</TE>
<TE>   "Journeys With George" premieres tonight  in Bush's Texas
backyard, the opening feature at the South by Southwest Film
Conference and Festival. The documentary has the political world
abuzz before the critics have even laid eyes on it.</TE>
<TE>   As a producer for NBC News, Pelosi spent a year on the road with
Bush and her camcorder, catching the future president unedited,
unplugged and unaided by spin doctors. And because she is a lifelong
liberal and the youngest daughter of Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San
Francisco, the Democratic whip and most powerful woman in the House,
the inevitable Washington question is raised: Is this one filmmaker's
humanizing portrait of a president-to-be or a partisan plot to ding
him in his finest hour?</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly think it's a Rorschach test," says Pelosi, a quirky
Gen-X journalist and admitted lifelong liberal who grew up stuffing
her mother's political mailers and making sandwiches for Democratic
functions. "If you love him you'll say, 'Look what a human being!' If
you don't like him, it may confirm your worst suspicions."</TE>
<TE>   She was known on the campaign plane for a mercurial personality
and loud purple clothes; her colleagues recall her bracing her arms
on the aisle seats and swinging her legs, calling to mind a monkey.
The production company she formed when she quit NBC to make her movie
is fittingly named Purple Monkey Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Her disarming personality both infuriated and charmed Bush, who
once scolded her as if she were a child for being chronically late
(he is painfully punctual) and gave her the silent treatment when she
asked him how he slept at night with so many executions under his
belt. Yet he seemed unable to resist engaging with her ubiquitous
lens. And so she captures him swilling nonalcoholic beer with relish,
something other photographers were barred from shooting. He sticks
his fingers in the ears of New York Times reporter Frank Bruni, whose
not-very-flattering "Ambling Into History, the Unlikely Odyssey of
George W. Bush" has just hit the stands. He makes faces and
impersonates Elvis.</TE>
<TE>   Crashing a press margarita party at 35,000 feet, he confides: "It
takes an animal to know an animal," adding strategically: "I'm not
admitting I'm an animal with 60 days to go in the campaign."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how the world will ever come to see "Journeys With
George." Pelosi has no publicist and no distributor, is answering her
own phone calls and made up press kits for tonight herself. The movie
has been finished for almost a year, but only a handful of people
have seen it. (Pelosi extended an open invitation to show it at her
apartment, but hardly anybody attended, except her mother.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet mere word has spawned national interest in a spectrum of
reactions that reflects the subjective nature of art:</TE>
<TE>   "Cutup in Chief," declared Time magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "Funny, kooky--and ultimately very human," concluded the New York
Post.</TE>
<TE>   "White House Unamused at Return of Curious George," noted the
Financial Times.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some aides have spent weeks anonymously voicing their
displeasure, saying Pelosi broke her promise that the otherwise
off-the-record footage would be for her "personal use." "This is my
personal use," she snaps. "It's my movie.... What did they think this
was for, the Pelosi family archives? I was a TV producer there with a
camera rolling in Bush's face. It's hard to believe he didn't know I
was making a movie."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, she notes, the then-governor not only acknowledged on
tape that the film would be one "lousy documentary" but came up with
the title himself. "Journeys With George," he suggested, adding
cryptically, "You know, you can spell it with a G."</TE>
<TE>   It's not all the attention that surprises Pelosi now: "He is after
all the president of the United States." What astounds her is that
she got away with making the film.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised no one came pounding on my door. You would think
him being the leader of the free world and NBC being [owned by] GE,
somebody would have asked what the hell I was up to. But no one did,"
she said gleefully one morning this week, fresh from a "Today" spot
on which she appeared in a lavender suit and pearls "so I'd look like
a grown-up."</TE>
<TE>   White House protestations have recently cooled.  "Now the White
House is supporting me," she told the Chicago Sun Times. "They don't
want me to have the publicity of 'The movie the White House didn't
want you to see.'"</TE>
<TE>   But at least one Republican strategist thinks the film will only
help personalize a wartime president. "It makes him look like a human
being," said Mark McKinnon, a Bush image advisor. He says Bush is
"great when the filters are off."</TE>
<TE>   What the president thinks of "Journeys With George" is a mystery.
He hasn't seen it (he didn't go to her house either), and Pelosi has
no plans to send him a copy. There will be a Washington screening,
though, and she says he's invited.</TE>

<HD>Reclaiming the Soul</HD>
<DH>Mary J. Blige, still a force in modern R&amp;B, sings of life
beyond drama with a potent mix of hip-hop and healing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"No more pain, no more drama," Mary J. Blige sang insistently and
repeatedly at one point in her frequently rousing concert Wednesday
at the Shrine Auditorium. "No more tears, I'm tired of crying."</LD>
<LD>   Those lines serve as the mantra for the woman whose songs about
overcoming romantic betrayal and abuse once made her a revolutionary
force in modern R&amp;B.</LD>
<LD>   The New York singer-songwriter came onto the pop scene with such
command and force a decade ago that fans and critics almost overnight
dubbed her the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul.</LD>
<TE>   The reason for the excitement was a debut album, "What's the
411?," that reflected much of the musical passion and sisterhood
commentary that was identified in the '60s with Aretha Franklin, the
original Queen of Soul.</TE>
<TE>   The album came at a time when R&amp;B singers, male and female, had
moved away from the rawness of soul music in favor of smoother, more
controlled and, crucially, more pop-minded expositions. Blige didn't
just revive the old, bolder sentiments, she also mixed them with
contemporary hip-hop sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, she became a voice of her generation and helped
open a door for one of the most valuable and productive pop
developments of recent years: the neo-soul movement that has given us
such outstanding talents as Lauryn Hill, Jill Scott, Angie Stone and
Alicia Keys.</TE>
<TE>   With some of those peers now getting more attention and making
more captivating music, Wednesday's show (the first of two nights at
the Shrine) gave Blige the opportunity to show she's not passe.</TE>
<TE>   After an energetic but routine opening set by R&amp;B singer Avant,
more than a dozen of Blige's band members, background singers and
dancers filled the stage, raising the immediate fear that Blige was
going to be smothered with a lot of razzle-dazzle.</TE>
<TE>   The concern was heightened when Blige began singing behind a giant
screen, which allowed her shadow to be projected in a way that made
her seem 15 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   The sign of a diva-sized ego?</TE>
<TE>   Hardly.</TE>
<TE>   When Blige did step forward, she moved about the stage with the
naturalness of a sister returning home, which was refreshing because
that sense of sisterhood has always been inherent to her appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Blige's fans, one senses, don't know just her songs, but also her
story--about growing up in the projects, falling in with the wrong
crowd, engaging in self-destructive behavior and abusive
relationships.</TE>
<TE>   The opening third of Wednesday's set was a toast to romance's
innocence and promise. The songs were generally upbeat celebrations
of real love--the kind that includes trust and respect.</TE>
<TE>   Against the backdrop of Blige's struggles to achieve that
relationship (she now says she has found her soul mate), the songs
carry a powerful, triumphant edge. Still, the sequence stretched too
long, making the sentiments feel one-dimensional.</TE>
<TE>   Things improved greatly in the evening's second segment, which
detailed the struggle of relationships in songs such as "Your Child"
and "I'm Goin' Down," that speak about suffering and deception in
striking and convincing terms.</TE>
<TE>   You could feel her shaking off the ache of a hundred past wounds
at the end of this segment, when she joyfully said, "Ain't you sick
and tired of being sick and tired."</TE>
<TE>   The night's final portion dealt with facing reality and moving
forward and it produced the evening's most memorable moment.</TE>
<TE>   While Blige was backstage changing her costume, a tape of her poem
"Forever No More" was played over the sound system. The poem, from
her current "No More Drama" album, is a summary statement of Blige's
own liberation and a salute to the inner peace that runs through much
of the album. "Thank you God for setting me free," she says. "And
thank you God for giving me back me."</TE>
<TE>   When Blige returned to the stage, she was at the piano for the
only time in the evening, playing the intro to "No More Drama," which
has become her signature song. Coming after the show's downcast
middle section, it was perfectly placed, and Blige sang it with a
warm, rich, show-stopping spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Though there are few overtly gospel elements in her music, there
is a missionary zeal in her approach--the sense of someone who has
found the promised land in her own life and believes it's possible
for others to follow her there.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than be beaten down by life, Blige is a testimony to
fighting back and getting stronger, and her continued ability to tell
that story shows why her importance in the R&amp;B world hasn't been
diminished by time or the competition.</TE>

<HD>ESPN Takes a Shot, and Misses</HD>
<DH>The network's first original movie, 'Season on Brink,'
about Bob Knight, is an airball.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although famed college basketball coach Bob Knight is many things, no
one has suggested he's dull.</LD>
<LD>   Until now.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, ESPN achieves the seemingly impossible by exposing
Knight as tedious. A drag. A lump. A potbelly in a Hoosier red.
Watching "A Season on the Brink" will give you leaden lids.</LD>
<TE>   This is the cable sports network's first original movie, one of
the ways it's trying to redefine itself by airing blocks of original
programming as opposed to its traditional sports coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "A Season on the Brink" is pointless and utterly numbing, though,
one of the least watchable TV movies in years despite its genesis
being John Feinstein's respected bestseller of the same name, its
writer being the highly able David W. Rintels and its star being
capable Brian Dennehy.</TE>
<TE>   The volcanic Knight is as renowned for his courtside raging and
tyrannical behavior as for being one of the nation's most successful
college basketball coaches, a reputation he built at Indiana before
being ousted because of alleged misconduct. After leaving Indiana, he
was hired by Texas Tech.</TE>
<TE>   "A Season on the Brink" is a movie on the brink, as it ploddingly
follows Knight and his Hoosiers during the 1985-86 season. Why is
this a seminal season for Knight, and for viewers to know about, as
opposed to other seasons? Because Feinstein wrote about it? There's
no hint here, except that the movie begins with Knight's famous
chair-throwing tirade against Purdue that became his signature snit.</TE>
<TE>   Hereafter, it's one game, one mood swing and one language-bleeped
outburst after another, with Knight (Dennehy) impersonating Vesuvius
while bullying and verbally brutalizing such selected players as
Steve Alford (James Lafferty) and Daryl Thomas (Michael James
Johnson) for reasons never quite made clear. Is this really part of a
coaching strategy to motivate them--we also see Knight display
kindness toward the same players he picks on--or is he looking for
scapegoats and totally out of control?</TE>
<TE>   And if he is, why is he? Also, where is his wife, and why does he
live alone with his son?</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Robert Mandel, this episodic account doesn't pause for
reflection. Dennehy has the glower, the seething anger and the
hulkiness, all surface manifestations of something that's eating
Knight. But you won't find out about it here.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, soon Indiana is playing Michigan for the Big Ten
championship, and Knight is teed off. Again. Again. And again.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a thought: Bleep the entire movie.</TE>
<TE>   "A Season on the Brink" premieres Sunday at 5 and 9 p.m. on ESPN
and ESPN2. The network will simulcast two versions, rating the one
shown on ESPN2 TV-14-L (may be unsuitable for children under 14) and
an unedited version on ESPN rated TV-MA-L (may be unsuitable for
children under 17). Both carry a special advisory for coarse
language.</TE>

<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Jules and Gedeon Naudet simply wanted to make a film about a rookie
New York City firefighter, perhaps dispelling some Hollywood myths
about the job. In the end, they did that and much, much more.</LD>
<LD>   On the morning of Sept. 11, Jules Naudet was practicing his camera
skills, tagging along on a potential gas-leak run with some members
of the firehouse where the two French brothers had been hanging out
filming since June. The firehouse served the World Trade Center
towers.</LD>
<LD>   So when Jules heard the roar overhead, he followed with his
camera, catching the only known footage of the first terrorist-aimed
plane to strike the towers--part of the footage that has become the
basis for "9/11," the CBS documentary being broadcast Sunday. Jules
went with the firefighters to the scene and got permission to enter
the towers with them, filming their attempted rescue operations
before the towers came crashing down, and capturing some in their
last living moments.</LD>
<TE>   His brother Gedeon, meanwhile, had his unique perspective as he
continued filming  rookie firefighter Tony Benetatos, who was holding
down the firehouse himself. Later, Gedeon headed out in the street,
and he was back at the firehouse when members of the crew straggled
in after narrowly escaping the collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Many other New Yorkers captured dramatic footage of the day, but
the Naudets' is unique in seeing the events through the eyes of the
firefighters, 343 of whom lost their lives. The brothers were also
unusual in that, aside from releasing brief footage of the first
plane attack to all media outlets, they chose to keep their tapes out
of public sight for months.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the footage wasn't well traveled. The FBI borrowed the
tapes for two days to see what it could glean. The footage was also
widely circulated in the Fire Department, which found it valuable in
reconstructing operations that day.</TE>
<TE>   But the Naudets brushed off attempts to buy their footage, despite
offers of "insane amounts of money" that ran into the millions of
dollars, Gedeon said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, however, a deal was put together that included an
article in Vanity Fair and a two-hour CBS broadcast, whittled from
the 180 hours of tape the brothers had shot.</TE>
<TE>   It's an unusual marriage of a major broadcaster and independent
documentarians, but the brothers say CBS understood that the story
had to be told as a film, and had to serve as a fund-raiser--as the
special will do--for scholarships for firefighters' children.
Commercial breaks will be limited and sponsor Nextel will use its
time for public service ads.</TE>
<TE>   While the dramatic footage shot in and around the towers is the
heart of the broadcast, the documentary includes its original
angle--telling the rookie's story--except that the "probie"
(probationary) firefighter had a much steeper learning curve than
they expected, a crash course taught in nine grueling hours instead
of the usual nine months. The brothers, who had run into some initial
resistance to their project from the tight-knit firefighters in the
house, forged a bond with their subjects.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we feel in love, completely, with the firehouse and all
of them," Jules said.</TE>

<HD>'Borstal Boy' Translates Irish Memoir to the Screen</HD>
<DH>The film, loosely inspired by the life of writer Brendan
Behan, paints a portrait of the troubled artist as a young man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an adult, Irishman Brendan Behan was known for two things, the
vivid plays he wrote ("The Quare Fellow," "The Hostage") and the
commotions he caused when he was inebriated, which was often. A
self-described "drinker with a writing problem," he died at age 41;
his funeral is said to have been Dublin's largest since that of the
great hero of independence, Michael Collins.</LD>
<LD>   "Borstal Boy," "inspired by" Behan's memoir of the same name, is a
portrait of that troubled artist as a young man trying to figure out
how to be himself. Carefully and intelligently made by director Peter
Sheridan, it is, as Sheridan's co-writer Nye Heron has said in
interviews, somewhat of a romanticization of a portion of Behan's
life.</LD>
<LD>   But if the film flirts with being sentimental, it never completely
gives in: The inherent strength of the material as well as the
integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint
as well as warmth.</LD>
<TE>   One of "Borstal Boy's" virtues is the performance of American-born
actor Shawn Hatosy ("Down to You," "Anywhere but Here") as the
16-year-old Behan. With an acceptable Dublin accent and a quiet
charisma, Hatosy truly inhabits the role of this feisty, pugnacious
young man who believes it when he says, "I always know what I'm
talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Behan is introduced, just so there's no mistaking his sentiments,
strapping dynamite to the insides of his thighs. It's 1939 and,
though a teenager, Behan's a committed IRA partisan, smuggling
bomb-making equipment into England and prepared to die for the Irish
cause if necessary. The despised British legal system, which quickly
captures him, has other ideas for the young man. Because Behan's
underage, he's sent to a British reform school, or borstal, in East
Anglia, where the inmates are made to wear short pants to remind them
that they are still boys, which, despite their bravado, they very
much are.</TE>
<TE>   This borstal is run by C.A. Joyce, who, like the film, is kindly
without being a pushover. As played by Michael York in one of his
best performances in years, Joyce is both caring and firm, telling
the boys that they had better not "sneak off without telling me."</TE>
<TE>   The film gives Joyce something he apparently didn't have in
real-life, an eligible young daughter named Liz (Eva Birthistle), who
just happens to be an artist and who just happens to be on-site at
the same time Brendan is. Naturally, some romantic interest is in the
offing, but Liz's function is more to stimulate Behan's creative side
and help his lifelong antipathy toward the English dissipate.</TE>
<TE>   Most of "Borstal Boy" involves Behan's interaction with the other
boys, including such recognizable types as Dale (Lee Ingleby), the
resident bully, and Jock (Robin Laing), a tireless escape artist. And
then there is Charlie Millwall (Danny Dyer), whose interaction with
Behan is more intense and less predictable.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie is an unapologetically gay Naval cadet who definitely
fancies the young Irishman. Though the film initially shows Behan
bristling at anything resembling a comforting male presence, one of
"Borstal Boy's" strengths is the naturalness with which it portrays
Behan's acknowledgement of his increasing sexual duality, his
attraction to both Liz and Charlie.</TE>
<TE>   Though you wouldn't necessarily know it, "Borstal Boy" is the
first feature-length film for director Sheridan, who has considerable
theater experience, often in combination with his brother Jim ("My
Left Foot," "In The Name of the Father"), who is one of this film's
executive producers.</TE>
<TE>   Assured and well-crafted, "Borstal Boy" mixes tragic events with
expected happenings like the de rigueur sports event (it's a rugby
game this time) between the inmates and representatives of authority.
Even if the notes are quiet and in a minor key, Sheridan manages to
hit them just right.</TE>
<TE>   No MPAA rating. Times guidelines: some beatings and adult subject
matter.</TE>

<HD>Anouk Aimee: A Most Down-to-Earth Superstar</HD>
<DH>Movies* The French screen legend has no vanity or ego, says
the director who enticed her to do 'Festival in Cannes.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anouk Aimee has been acting for the last 56 years. She's won a Golden
Globe and best actress honors at the Cannes Film Festival and was
nominated for an Academy Award. Last Saturday, the French beauty
received a Cesar--France's counterpart to the Oscar--for lifetime
achievement. And she's been the muse of many directors, including
Federico Fellini ("La Dolce Vita," "81/2"), Claude Lelouch ("A Man
and a Woman") and Jacques Demy ("Lola"). But even with that legacy,
Aimee doesn't seem to believe that she's anything exceptional.</LD>
<LD>   She didn't even feel she deserved the Golden Globe for her
performance as a beautiful young widow in the 1966 film "A Man and a
Woman." "When we went to the Golden Globes, I remember I saw Fred
Astaire," said Aimee, still stunning at 69.</LD>
<LD>   "John Wayne came over to talk to me. Groucho Marx. These are
people I admired when I was a kid and here they are applauding me. I
don't understand. It's wrong."</LD>
<TE>   Henry Jaglom, the writer and director of Aimee's new film,
"Festival in Cannes," reports the actress was surprised at the
reaction from the audience at last week's Los Angeles premiere of the
romantic roundelay.</TE>
<TE>   "The audience went crazy for her," says Jaglom. "She kept saying,
'Why are they coming up and telling me [they love me]?' I said, 'You
are magnificent. Do you think every single person is making it up?'
And she said, 'No, no, no. I don't even know what I'm doing.' She is
so genuinely modest. No vanity. No ego."</TE>
<TE>   In "Festival in Cannes," which was filmed in 2000 in the French
festival city, opens in limited release today. Aimee plays Millie
Marquand, an aging screen legend attending the Cannes Film Festival
who must decide whether to do a cameo in a Tom Hanks blockbuster or a
meaty lead role in a low-budget independent film that will be
directed by an actress (Greta Scacchi). Maximilian Schell plays
Aimee's notoriously unfaithful husband and Ron Silver is a powerful
Hollywood producer determined to get Marquand for the Hanks film.</TE>
<TE>   The actress, who lives in Paris, met Jaglom in Beverly Hills about
five years ago at an event at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences celebrating the 50th anniversary of Cannes. "He wanted to do
a film with me," she says matter-of-factly.</TE>
<TE>   Jaglom recalls attending the evening at the academy with Candice
Bergen. "She said 'Look over there. That's Anouk Aimee.' My heart
stopped because 'A Man and a Woman' was this movie that had meant
more to me romantically and emotionally. And the most important movie
in my mind creatively was '81/2.' I was sort of star-struck. Candice
took me over and introduced me and this is what I heard myself
saying: "I have been looking all over for you. I have a movie I want
you to make.'"</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, he didn't have a movie for Aimee. But he knew he
wanted to work with her. So he sent her copies of his films and two
days later, she called him. "She said, 'I'll do whatever you want.
Now, what is the film about?' I said it's the kind of film where the
person who plays the lead shouldn't know too much about what it is
about at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Jaglom promised to call Aimee three months later with the film's
concept. Meanwhile, he racked his brains trying to come up with his
idea when he remembered an abandoned project from the '70s in which
Gene Kelly was to play an aging superstar who comes to Cannes.</TE>
<TE>   "It suddenly occurred to me I could apply [that movie]," Jaglom
says. "It would also open up this whole subject I have been very
preoccupied with in all of my movies, which is how women are treated
when they get older--both generally and specifically in our
culture--by the film world, which is a metaphor for the whole world,
and how women are discarded and dealt with at a certain age. [The
film] was born of my lie."</TE>
<TE>   Aimee quickly took to Jaglom's unconventional, improvisational
directing style, having worked in similar fashion with Fellini,
Lelouch and Robert Altman ("Ready to Wear").</TE>
<TE>   Plus, says Aimee, "I like the person. I like the man of Henry--the
way he explains things. I loved working with him. It's like an
adventure. We don't know where we are going."</TE>
<TE>   Ageism, Aimee says, is just as prevalent in Europe as it is in
American cinema. "I would say maybe it is worse," says Aimee.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was young, a woman of 40 or 50 used to do parts of women
15 or 25. Now it is the contrary. It is the young woman of 18 or 20
doing the part of a 40- or 50-year-old. They will take a girl, very
young, to do a part that is older."</TE>
<TE>   Her most recent work was on "Napoleon," a European miniseries that
also stars Gerard Depardieu and John Malkovich. Christian Clavier and
Isabella Rossellini play Napoleon and Josephine. The miniseries was
filmed in France and the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Aimee, who proudly declares that she has had no plastic surgery
("She is a great advertisement for natural beauty and trusting
nature," says Jaglom), began acting at the age of 13 in the film "La
maison sous la mer." Aimee says she was walking down a street in
Paris with her mother, a former actress, when a director approached
her. "He said, 'Would you like to make a film?'"</TE>
<TE>   Born Francoise Sorya Dreyfus, she adopted her character's name in
the film, Anouk, as her screen name. The following year, while she
was starring in a film for Marcel Carne which was never completed,
the movie's screenwriter, Jacques Prevert, gave her the last name of
Aimee. "He said when you are going to be 40 you cannot be called
Anouk alone," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Though she was much in demand in the late '40s and '50s, Aimee
didn't fall in love with her profession until she played the rich
nymphomaniac in "La Dolce Vita" (1960).</TE>
<TE>   "Before I met Fellini ... I didn't realize what acting was," she
says. Fellini, she says, thought she was a cover girl. "He was always
joking and lying," Aimee says, laughing. "The story he told me was he
saw my picture in a magazine and said, 'I want to see her.'"</TE>
<TE>   Fellini taught her not to take herself too seriously. "Acting was
part of our everyday life," says Aimee. "What embarrassed me before
was that a lot of [actors] think of themselves seriously. That bored
me. But with Fellini and [star] Marcello Mastroianni, it was a big
festival, a beautiful party. From then I began to love [acting]."</TE>
<TE>   In between the two Fellini films she made Demy's first feature,
"Lola" (1961), in which she played a cabaret dancer and single
mother. The restored version of "Lola" opens March 25 at the Nuart.</TE>
<TE>   "'Lola' is one of my favorites," she says. "I think 'Lola' maybe
is his best film. Jacques was good with actors. He was poetic. He
liked women."</TE>
<TE>   Eight years later, they made a sequel in Los Angeles called "The
Model Shop." Aimee's leading man in the film was Gary Lockwood, fresh
from "2001: A Space Odyssey."</TE>
<TE>   But Lockwood wasn't Demy's first choice. "You know who was going
to be the actor?," Aimee asks. "Harrison Ford. He was unknown and
Demy was very happy that he got him. I remember he said, 'I found a
wonderful actor.' I saw him on tape. But [the studio] didn't want
him. They said he wouldn't make any money."</TE>
<TE>   But even with Lockwood, "The Model Shop" flopped.</TE>
<TE>   Aimee vividly recalls the surreal experience of the "A Man and a
Woman" phenomenon. Aimee received an Oscar nomination for her
haunting performance as a widow who meets a widower (Jean-Louis
Trintignant) at their children's boarding school. They become
friends, then closer friends and then lovers until she realizes that
her late husband is still too strong in her memory and in her heart
for their relationship to work.</TE>
<TE>   "A Man and a Woman" won best foreign language film, and Lelouch
and Pierre Uytterhoeven picked up the Oscars for original screenplay.
"It was unbelievable," says Aimee. "It was an incredible adventure. I
must say I owe a lot to American films because I have always been
received very well here. People behave very well with me in
America--that's true. I am one of the Europeans who love it [in
America].</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds pretentious, but American film people behave so
incredibly with me. So nice. They ask me to work. It's wonderful. I
have always been lucky here."</TE>

<HD>Wartime Loot Gets a Too-Hasty Boot</HD>
<DH>LACMA's return of a tapestry to a Polish museum is
laudable, but why couldn't the public have viewed it first?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art held a brief
"Ceremony for the Return of a Textile to a Polish Museum." A work of
art in LACMA's collection was discovered to have been looted by the
Nazis during World War II, and now restitution was being made.
Shortly after 2 p.m., while the museum was closed to the public,
Andrea L. Rich leaned into the microphone set up in the lobby of the
museum's Anderson Building and declared in stentorian tones to
invited guests how she was "so proud" to be director of LACMA at this
important moment.</LD>
<LD>   Krzysztof W. Kasprzyk, consul general of the Republic of Poland in
Los Angeles, stepped to the podium and accepted the return of the
textile on behalf of the Princes Czartoryski Foundation Museum in
Krakow. He was visibly moved. The late medieval tapestry, looted from
Poland by the Nazis not once but twice during World War II, was
finally going home where it belonged.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, as you read these words, the textile should already be in
transit to Krakow.</LD>
<TE>   The legal, moral and ethical issues around Nazi looting have grown
exponentially in importance since the end of the Cold War. Finally,
they have come home to roost at LACMA, in the first instance of a
work of art in its collection that can definitively be shown to have
been war booty. The museum, after a year of diligent research, is
convinced of the authenticity of the Polish museum's claim on the
work, has made the necessary legal and diplomatic arrangements for
the return of the textile and is sending it on its way.</TE>
<TE>   I've got just one question: What is the bloody rush? Wednesday's
announcement was the museum's first public airing of a high-profile
situation of critical importance to its constituency, and 48 hours
later the textile is gone from L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   No provisions were made for the tapestry, which has been rolled up
in museum storage for 20 years, to be shown to the people of Los
Angeles County. We have owned this work of art for more than three
decades, when our museum acquired it for us in good faith from a
local dealer. Our public museum bought it, cared for it and paid for
comprehensive research on its tormented history of past ownership. So
why aren't we owed an opportunity to see it before it gets sent 7,000
miles away to Eastern Europe?</TE>
<TE>   Certainly it's correct that the textile should be returned to its
rightful owner. No credible argument can be made for keeping stolen
art. But what's up with the bum's rush? You'd think the Czartoryski
textile was radioactive--that it needed to be shipped to the Yucca
Mountain of Krakow right now, before Angelenos start to glow in the
dark.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, when the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn.,
discovered that a Florentine Mannerist painting in its collection had
been looted from the Italian embassy in Berlin during the war's
chaotic final days, the museum's director made arrangements for its
return to Italy. He also took the opportunity to organize a loan
exhibition that was built around compatible works in the Wadsworth's
collection and in the Roman museum where the stolen painting was
being returned. The looted canvas, a biblical scene by the minor
painter Jacopo Zucchi (1541-1590), wasn't part of that 1998
exhibition; but it hung at the entrance during the run of the show,
with a full explanation of the thorny problem of Nazi loot. The
Hartford public benefited mightily from an otherwise difficult and
unhappy situation.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA didn't offer its public any such thing. The board of
trustees voted to return the textile at a meeting Feb. 6, and then
the museum sat on the announcement for four weeks. The textile
remained rolled up in storage, when at least it could have spent the
month on public display.</TE>
<TE>   The textile in question is a late-medieval Persian or Mughal
ceremonial canopy, reportedly 7 feet wide and 9 feet long, whose silk
and metallic weaving features the depiction of an ancient prince
surrounded by angels, birds, animals and figures bearing gifts. Now,
I'm no scholar of 15th century textiles, Persian, Mughal or
otherwise. But if you happen to be--or even if you're just curious
about a work that is so treasured by its rightful owners--you're out
of luck. Unless you happened to catch the Czartoryski textile during
its last public appearance at LACMA in 1983--well, there's always
Krakow in your future.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's ceremony, where the sanctimony was so thick you
could cut it with a knife, the textile was laid out on a table rolled
up in acid-free storage paper next to the podium, with just a small
portion visible. It looked pleasant, if not compelling. Indeed, the
museum says it's a study piece, not a major work of art, which had
been damaged and extensively repaired when LACMA bought it for a few
thousand dollars in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the intrinsic quality of the piece is wholly beside the
point. Jacopo Zucchi wasn't exactly the toast of 16th century
Florence, either.</TE>
<TE>   The museum claims the tapestry can't be publicly displayed in its
current condition because it's "too fragile"--and certainly the small
section that was on view was not in pristine condition. But, frankly,
conservation status is a flimsy excuse. Unrolling the textile for a
few weeks of public display cannot reasonably be claimed to be a
curatorial impossibility--especially given the gravity of the
international issue of Nazi loot and the opportunity for public
enlightenment. It could even have been just  partly unrolled, as it
was at Wednesday's private ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   We should be thankful that the museum has apparently handled the
administrative aspects of the repatriation with diligence. Yet, we
should be just as concerned that it has bungled the artistic
component of its public charge. For in shutting out its audience,
LACMA has created an untenable Hobson's choice: The art public is
left to wonder whether the museum doesn't know any better, or whether
it has something to hide. Neither explanation offers much
consolation.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Creed has struck gold singing with arms wide open, Rufus
Wainwright is mining another rich vein by opening his heart.</LD>
<LD>   His sophomore album may be titled "Poses," but in his show
Wednesday at the House of Blues in Anaheim, the singer-songwriter's
unabashed emotionalism never felt less than genuine, often eliciting
rapturous shrieks from the late teens and early twentysomethings who
are his core audience.</LD>
<LD>   Wainwright's intensely theatrical music is romantic with a capital
R, an often captivating fusion of early 20th century cabaret and
melodious pop-rock infused in the sense and sensibility of 18th and
19th century European literature. He'd be a first-round pick to score
the next Jane Austen novel that goes to the big screen.</LD>
<TE>   He leaned heavily on material from "Poses," in which he's backed
off a lot from the ultra-dramatic arrangements of his 1998 debut
album. Wainwright delivered half a dozen songs from "Poses" before
turning to tunes he's contributed to recent films--versions of
Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" from "Shrek" and the Beatles' "Across
the Universe" from "I Am Sam"-- along with a handful of songs from
his acclaimed first album.</TE>
<TE>   The impression of a naif alone, adrift and yearning for human
contact, connects his current and earlier work. He also displayed a
sense of whimsy--though not the same love for sharp satire and
irony--evidently inherited from his dad, singer-songwriter Loudon
Wainwright III, as well as a capacity for unadulterated emotion like
that of his singer-songwriter mother, Kate McGarrigle.</TE>
<TE>   There's probably more McGarrigle than Wainwright in Rufus' music,
but when he does juxtapose humor and unflinching honesty, the result
can be as intriguing as his performance of the upbeat yet wistful
"Beauty Mark," which conjured the image of a droopy-jowled Buster
Keaton skipping and whistling down the road.</TE>
<TE>   Rufus Wainwright, with Teddy Thompson, today at the Wilshire Ebell
Theatre, 4401 W. 8th St., L.A., 7:30 p.m. Sold out. (323) 939-1128.</TE>

<HD>A Return to the Edge of Horror</HD>
<DH>The documentary '9/11' relives the drama of the trade
center attack without fixating on the grisly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--On the afternoon of Sept. 11, the managing partner of a law
firm was recalling how he quickly rounded up everyone in the office
after the "big bang" shook the World Trade Center's north tower,
where they were perched on the 85th floor. They made it first to the
"sky lobby" on the 78th, then through smoke to another stairwell and
then down.</LD>
<LD>   They stalled several times but made it to the main lobby, then the
street and, as the tower collapsed behind them, he was part of the
ash-covered foot parade uptown. He made it to Long Island in time for
his son's 11th birthday party, complete with ice cream cake. "It's a
good day for a celebration," he said then.</LD>
<LD>   Then he paused, having heard his own words. There was cause for
celebration, of course. But three employees of his firm were
unaccounted for. Later, one would be found, but two never were,
apparently caught in the elevators on their way up to work. And there
was something else: His memory of how, when his fleeing group got
down to floors in "the 50s," they passed another group, "firemen
walking up, carrying hoses, pushing past us." The firemen had even
left them gifts of sorts, breaking open soda machines on the landings
so the evacuees had something to soothe their burning throats.</LD>
<TE>   What could he say? Was he not supposed to celebrate? But how could
he also not feel an odd guilt at being alive? How could he not feel a
sense of unease he would never fully understand?</TE>
<TE>   The CBS documentary "9/11" brings us back to the overwhelming
intensity of that day, and all those confusing emotions. But it also
takes us places we haven't been before--for its camera follows the
firefighters who were headed up while the lawyer, his workmates and
thousands of others headed down. At least, the camera follows them to
a point, to the lobby of that north tower. Then off they go, heading
up, 60 pounds of gear on their backs, many never to return.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of mine who wrote a book about those who came of age
during the Vietnam War concluded that there was a huge wall dividing
that generation, between those who went and those who didn't.</TE>
<TE>   It's much the same with Sept. 11, except that the wall is between
those who perished and the survivors--even if it was pure chance that
often separated one group from the other.</TE>
<TE>   If you worked above a certain floor, where the planes struck, you
were doomed. If you were a uniformed rescuer who rushed to the scene
and tried to save people in the south tower--the first to
crumble--you were doomed.</TE>
<TE>   From the first moment, we thirsted for any last words of those who
perished, for any hints of their experience, whether in "I love you"
messages left on answering machines or the terse battle cry uttered
on a hijacked plane, "Let's roll."</TE>
<TE>   But most of the testimony in the aftermath had to be from the
survivors. And it's the same with the ongoing debate over what it
means--that too is left to the survivors.</TE>
<TE>   So it is with the much-awaited "9/11," which airs Sunday night, on
the eve of the six-month anniversary. It's also about survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Few had seen the videotape, but that didn't stop speculation over
what graphic images the two young French filmmakers who shot it might
have captured--and which ones the producers would dare show. Some
suggested it would be hurtful to victims' families, or sacrilegious,
to show even the faces of men about to go to their deaths, much less
their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, the ashes land on us softly in this compelling two
hours, as they did on the man clutching the camera as he ran from the
disintegrating tower, 28-year-old Jules Naudet.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should see this," Naudet says earlier, just as he enters
the lobby, explaining into his microphone why he will not turn his
camera toward two burning bodies to his right. As close as we come to
the abyss, we don't fall in. He makes the decision for us--we won't
even peer directly at it. In the manner of survivors, watching out
for ourselves, we divert our eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Naudet also makes the decision that it's wrenching enough to hear
the crashing sounds outside, suspecting they are the bodies of people
jumping from floors that are burning far above. He allows us to
wonder, with the firefighters, what the jumpers must be going through
up there, but we won't go outside to see what's left of them. The
thuds are more than enough.</TE>
<TE>   That this is a tale of survivors is not merely by choice. Chance
played a part too. Jules Naudet and his brother Gedeon, 32, were
spending the summer following a probationary fireman, intending to
produce a boy-becomes-a-man documentary as the young "probie" is
challenged both by fires and the bust-your-chops veterans inside the
century-old Lower Manhattan firehouse of Engine 7, Ladder 1. Instead,
both the rookie and the brothers spent the summer learning more about
cooking for the boys than fires--there was not a single one until
Sept. 11, when they happened to be in the crew closest to the World
Trade Center, checking out a harmless gas leak blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   That's when we hear a loud sound, faces look up and Jules has the
instinct to turn his camera up too, in time to catch the first
hijacked jetliner strike the north tower. Many cameras were poised by
the time the second jet hit the south tower, but he was the only one
to capture the first--or to be in either tower with the firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite being first at the scene, every member of the
firehouse made it back to the Duane Street station. That's how Engine
7 came to be known as "Lucky 7."</TE>
<TE>   To that extent, the documentary is a little like one of those war
movies in which a select few combatants become "our characters."
Whatever devastation is around them, and whichever secondary
characters must fall, we keep our eye on ours guys and exult when
they pull through.</TE>
<TE>   They do in part because of the quick action of their commander,
Chief Joseph Pfeifer, whom the camera is sticking by in the lobby as
he confers with other chiefs. Barely a minute after the tower to the
south falls, he gives the order, "All units. Evacuate the building."</TE>
<TE>   One who doesn't make it out is Pfeifer's own brother, from another
firehouse. The only glimpse of a dead body is the boot of the revered
Fire Department chaplain, Father Mychal Judge, being carried out
minutes after he was praying for the safety of others.</TE>
<TE>   To a degree remarkable in a day when most storytelling resists no
opportunity to overstate the obvious, the filmmakers recognize the
power of understatement. The tension is there naturally, in the
manner--not to trivialize it--of a horror film. We in the audience
know what's happening--the people living the moment do not. We want
to stop the firefighters heading up the stairs. And when we watch a
World Trade Center official use an intercom to try speaking to
whoeever may be trapped inside dozens of elevators, we understand why
he's getting only silence. We know how burning jet fuel poured down
the shafts.</TE>
<TE>   There were several reasons we felt better about ourselves in the
weeks after Sept. 11. On the simplest level, we had an enemy to unite
us. But it also was that our culture of rampant egos was humbled. Who
dared exploit the moment, or those victims?</TE>
<TE>   So you saw Paul McCartney and other stars playing not to the
luminaries who paid $10,000 a ticket but "the real heroes" given the
prime seats on the floor of Madison Square Garden, the uniformed
rescue workers. And you saw them, in turn, saying, "It's not about
us," instead waving photos of dead colleagues whose names they
insisted be read from the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, of course, we had squabbling over what sort of faces
should be portrayed on a memorial statue of firefighters, and over
how charity donations would be doled out. We got around to being
ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   But by taking us back to the earlier moment, the makers of "9/11"
have recognized that they will be scrutinized by the earlier
standard, when phoniness and exploitation wouldn't cut it.</TE>
<TE>   The film does raise some questions. I was not the only one to
wonder at a screening Monday, for example, about a scene showing the
filmmaking brothers embracing back at the firehouse after a day of
not knowing if the other had survived. Someone else at the screening
asked who had taken that shot? Was it, in other words, self-conscious
heart-tugging manipulation? The Naudets said "an old friend" was with
them and picked up one of their cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Others may wonder whether it was appropriate to add wistful
background music, which the producers said was "needed as mile
markers." But such moments of skepticism are rare. The filmmakers
don't provide us with many such "outs," with easy escapes from
tensions that need no enhancement.</TE>
<TE>   When a retired fire chief rushes in because he wants to help out,
and heads to what became known as ground zero, they don't try to
manufacture suspense over whether he makes it out. We get an
after-the-fact talking-head shot of him right away, signaling to us
that he is among the living.</TE>
<TE>   The producers said they did tweak reality a bit, mostly to tone
down its harrowing nature, not enhance it. Viewers will hear fewer
thuds of falling bodies than the microphone picked up. They also will
hear fewer curse words from the firemen, though dozens remain--as
viewers are warned at the start, the documentary sets a new standard
for network television in echoing that reality.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over how much raw "9/11" reality we can take will
hardly end with this show. As is well known, HBO is preparing its own
documentary on that day, one that apparently won't divert its eyes,
or camera, from the falling bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans have already seen those images. Americans tend to look
away, wary of crossing the line beyond which undeniable fascination
becomes prurient interest.</TE>
<TE>   As with the Naudets' documentary for CBS, however, it's unfair to
begin the debate before seeing the work. There are times when the
most horrifying pictures--like the mass graves of the Nazi
Holocaust--must be seen. In that case, they should have been seen
sooner rather than later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "9/11" will be shown Sunday night at 9 on CBS. The network has
rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children). The broadcast
also carries warnings of coarse language.</TE>

<LD>   Russian President Takes Kids' TV Fare to Task</LD>
<LD>   U.S. broadcasters aren't the only ones who get chided by
government officials for the quality of children's television
programming. Russian President Vladimir V. Putin sounded off on the
state of affairs in his nation this week, urging media executives to
step up production of cultural children's shows.</LD>
<TE>   According to TheMoscowTimes.com, televised fairy tales, popular
during the Soviet era, have largely been replaced with children's
game shows and imported cartoons, including the widely criticized
"Pokemon." The three national channels often air violent crime shows
during afternoon and evening hours.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the task of creative intellectuals to create such cultural
examples that would squeeze out morally and artistically deficient
characters and plots," Putin said at a meeting with officials and
cultural figures in the Kremlin. "The majority of national channels
violate the basic rules of children's programming in connection with
this."</TE>
<TE>   Licenses for TV channels in Russia put quotas on children's
programming but they are rarely met. Putin ordered the press ministry
to monitor them more closely and to use the media to deal with
problems such as child loneliness and neglect.</TE>

<TE>   Controversy Follows Grammy Speech</TE>
<TE>   On the Grammy Awards telecast last week, National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences President Michael Greene addressed the
problem of unauthorized trading of songs on the Internet. To
illustrate his point, he showed clips of people he said were three
students whom the academy arranged to tape as they downloaded nearly
6,000 songs in two days.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry insiders found it strange that he'd acknowledge, on
national TV, that the academy had broken the Electronic Theft Act.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the New York Times reports, one of the downloaders has
stepped forward to say that Greene's allegations aren't true.
Although his two colleagues were UCLA students, Numair Faraz said he
left school to found a technology business. And most of the music
wasn't taken from publicly accessible file-exchange Web sites, he
said, but from music sent to them by friends via AOL Instant
Messenger.</TE>
<TE>   Because the songs may have been taken from CDs that were
purchased, there's no guarantee anything illegal went on.</TE>
<TE>   Barb Dehgan, a spokeswoman for the recording academy, said, "The
kids were asked to download as many songs as possible off the World
Wide Web, specifically publicly accessible Web sites." She did not
comment about the legality of the project.</TE>

<TE>   Barenboim Peace Initiative Put on Hold</TE>
<TE>   Yet more fallout from the Mideast conflict: Israeli
pianist-conductor Daniel Barenboim had to cancel a Wednesday night
concert in the West Bank city of Ramallah after authorities said they
couldn't guarantee his safety, BBC News reports. The event was
intended to be a musical plea for a dialogue to end the bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said it had banned all Israeli citizens from
entering territory under sole Palestinian control--and Barenboim was
no exception. The musician was to have performed the "Recital for
Peace" in the city, where Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has been
confined by Israeli forces since December.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian sponsors of the concert expressed the hope that it
could be rescheduled.</TE>

<TE>   Gelbart's Racy 'Lysistrata' Hits Snag</TE>
<TE>   Writer Larry Gelbart (the film "Tootsie," TV's "MASH") has
encountered problems with his adaptation of "Lysistrata," Aristotle's
play about sexual politics that was supposed to premiere in May at
the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   The project, subtitled "Sex and the City-State," was to have been
the valedictory production of artistic director Robert Brustein, who
is retiring at the end of the season. But leading lady Cherry Jones
and others involved in the production found it too racy, the New York
Observer reports, and refused to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than being performed with songs by Alan Menken and David
Zippel, as originally planned, it will now have a reading at the
Manhattan Theater Club on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Gelbart said that the phrase "'political correctness' was never
used, but I think if we dusted off the e-mail we might see those
fingerprints."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Mike Myers has put his legal conflict with
Universal/DreamWorks/Imagine Entertainment behind him and signed to
star in the title role of "Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat," an
adaptation of the kids' classic from those three companies.... Jon
Robin Baitz and David Henry Hwang, among others, will help the Center
Theatre Group celebrate its 35th anniversary by participating in a
panel, "Golden State of Mind: Seven Playwrights Consider California,"
at the Taper on April 15. The event is free but reservations are
required.... The MTV original series ''The Osbournes'' scored big in
its debut for the cable network, drawing more than 5 million viewers
Tuesday night, the highest series debut in MTV's history.... Orson
Welles, who died in 1985, is being resurrected to star in a new
London TV series, Variety reports. "Tales From the Black Museum" will
be narrated by the Hollywood legend, whose voice will be taken from
the 1952 BBC radio series of the same name, and will feature an actor
playing Welles in silhouette.... The Los Angeles Chamber Group is
presenting "Casting Pearls"--a premiere of David Woodard and Jack
Kevorkian's collaborative suite--as a memorial to slain Wall Street
Journal reporter Daniel Pearl on Saturday at Birmingham High School
in Van Nuys at 7:30 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Dilated Peoples Leaves Its Scratches on Surface</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Following sets by some renowned DJs at the Palace on Wednesday,
L.A.-based hip-hop trio Dilated Peoples capped a celebration of the
art of the turn- table with an uncompelling show only slightly
enlivened by such guests as the pioneering Grand Wizard Theodore.</LD>
<LD>   Also featuring a screening of the DJ documentary film "Scratch,"
the presentation underscored the rock-star status of turntablists in
hip-hop. Solo sets by Theodore--the Grandmaster Flash protege widely
credited with inventing scratching in the late '70s--and Beastie Boys
associate Mixmaster Mike also provided a sense of the art form's
two-decade history.</LD>
<LD>   After a mainstream-oriented turn by Z-Trip fusing recent hits to
cliched vintage rock and hip-hop riffs, Mixmaster Mike innovatively
used turntable manipulation for more traditionally percussive
effects. He proved a highlight with his adept cutting and scratching,
coupled with less obvious sonic choices.</LD>
<TE>   Backed by the nimble DJ Babu, Dilated Peoples rappers Evidence and
Iriscience offered selections from 2000's "The Platform" and last
year's "Expansion Team," among other things. Although reasonably
charismatic, the pair, who came to prominence with such underground
hits as the inventive call-to-consciousness "Work the Angles," too
often resorted to hookless, hackneyed pronouncements against
destructive conflicts ("War") and for loyalty to one's people ("Worst
Comes to Worst").</TE>
<TE>   Integrity can't be completely discounted, but the more die-hard
aspects of the keeping-it-real philosophy have limited Dilated
Peoples, who at one point Wednesday proclaimed they "won't go pop" to
satisfy "the ones across the street" (meaning their label, Capitol
Records). But mostly this bluster felt like a smokescreen for a
surprising lack of ideas.</TE>

<HD>Drawings Match Drama in Landscapes and Human Acts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strange things are going on in Jeanine Breaker's ravishingly
beautiful drawings at William Turner Gallery. In each panoramic slice
of landscape, the earth's natural drama offsets a human drama, both
odd and familiar.</LD>
<LD>   Odd, because the context makes no rational sense, but familiar,
because we have seen these acts before. Walking a tightrope, walking
on stilts, juggling with fire--these are classic components of the
circus repertoire.</LD>
<LD>   Matching spectacle with spectacle, Breaker sets these awe-evoking
acts in equally awe-inspiring places. The stilt walker passes in
silhouette before a windbreak, a perfectly aligned row of trees on a
low horizon. The sky behind him (gender being somewhat ambiguous) has
turned a deep, serene blue, though in the area he's just passed, it
ripples and flickers in luminous gold and white and pink, as
brilliant as the aurora borealis. In another of the drawings, tiny,
agile figures perform aerial feats, upside-down, against a stunning
backdrop of rugged, terraced pools, their surface reflecting the
radiant pink light of dawn or dusk.</LD>
<TE>   Breaker's own spectacular facility with pastel pulls us in close,
where we can better savor the drawings' vibrant colors and velvety
textures. These images of feats are feats in themselves, case studies
in pushing boundaries of skill and power. The subjects occupy an
arena of physical extremity that transcends the literal and seems to
rise to the level of metaphor. Breaker's images suggest conditions,
predicaments, risks, states of balance and hard-earned equilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   She titles her drawings with obsolete phrases and colorful
colloquialisms--"fog-dog," "to chant the play," "dive the twine,"
"blue fine of the dinkum oil"--that refer to phenomena of nature and
human ingenuity. These too stretch credibility, but are absolutely of
a piece with Breaker's playfully edgy imagery.</TE>
<TE>   Some speak of exposed tricks, false miracles and clever illusions,
practices of useful deceit as basic to art as to theater and the
circus sideshow. Breaker's tiny performers proceed without either
guile or irony, but with a self-possessed precision that is both
bewildering and beautiful to behold. Breaker's own performance in
these drawings is no less impressive.</TE>

<TE>   Contrived Monotony Dominates Installation</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Seager's scattershot installation at LACE can be described,
but not easily summarized. Her title hints at the problem: "188 loose
elements/things like/pure sound associations/improvisational
jazz/free form where in principal/everything is equal/the id/and the
superego/supersystems."</TE>
<TE>   In practice, when everything is equal, nothing stands out. Nothing
takes priority. Contrast, dynamism, tension take a back seat to
carefully contrived monotony. In Seager's installation, all of the
"loose elements" stay loose, purposefully (and somewhat
pretentiously) resisting order.</TE>
<TE>   Three large rolls of white paper (each 9 to 12 feet wide) unfurl
across the floor at skewed angles. Strewn upon them are sheets of
paper printed acid green, gray or hot pink, some cut or crumpled. A
sheet of musical staff paper rests atop one of the unrolled carpets
of paper, a jar of pushpins sits on another, some loose pins
scattered about. Two framed collages by the artist, who teaches at
Art Center College of Design, stand propped against one another, not
far from two crinkled sheets of silver paper, a wooden ax handle, and
two slim paper ribbons printed with the repeated phrases, "tiny
details but they weigh as heavy as 50,000 dead soldiers and horses in
Waterloo" and "complete scorched (in no way)." Five large panes of
glass lean against the walls, each sandblasted with text that makes
reference to sightlessness.</TE>
<TE>   There are tiny moments of visual poetry here: The corners of two
of the colored papers rise from the floor and meet in a kiss; the
sandblasted text reads in shadow form on the wall; and from above,
the installation as a whole suggests a spunky Constructivist
composition. But these aren't enough to give this collection of loose
ends a meaningful middle.</TE>
<TE>   The product of Seager's artful artlessness is a kind of framed
vacancy. The blank score, the white paper, the ax without a
blade--all speak of potentiality and latency, linking Seager to the
radical acts of John Cage and Marcel Duchamp. But empowering chance
and valuing contingency are no longer the daring moves they once
were. They've been stretched thin by artists like Seager--so thin
that they leave no thread to follow.</TE>

<TE>   Gentle Images With a Life-Affirming Message</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Joe Goode took a shotgun to his paintings in the early
1980s, pocking the canvases with frayed-edged craters, power has been
a palpable, if not always overt theme in his work. That series
(called "Environmental Impact") urged an equivalence between
violation of the painted surface and violation of the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Groups of work that followed by the L.A. painter and printmaker
have focused on oceans, waterfalls, tornados, fires and pollution,
with Goode eliciting both the awesome power of nature and the
fearsome power of humankind. We have the power to revere the earth
and not just to scar it through benign neglect or calculated policy,
and it's this affirming capacity that materializes in Goode's latest
works, at Bobbie Greenfield Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   These are exceedingly gentle images, intimately scaled and
privately imagined, beautiful studies of pure atmosphere. Each is no
larger than 15 inches per side, and many are half that size. The
drawings, in graphite or powdered pigment on paper, are each labeled
"Study for Oil and Water Painting," but the sense they give is less
that of opposites repelling than of neighboring substances on a
continuum. They easily read as cloud studies--akin to Alfred
Stieglitz's photographic "Equivalents"--or more abstractly, as
meditations on light and density, form and insubstantiality.</TE>
<TE>   Passages of luminosity ease into pools of shadow. Freckles of
light skim across the surface, sometimes in the form of a powdery
crust, like small evaporations of liquid light. Pigment, whether
predominantly gray or an intense, nearly royal blue, fills the sheets
from edge to edge, strengthening the impression that these are
framings (like Stieglitz's) of continuous, given fields.</TE>
<TE>   Two "Oil and Water Paintings" hang here among the drawings, but
the smaller studies, so concentrated and rich, outlast them in terms
of visual staying power. Graceful and personal, the drawings
articulate the hushed rapture of long, private meditation. Power
breathes through them--Goode's own and the profound energy of the
earth, at once vast and intimate.</TE>

<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At age 88, Helen Levitt is losing her fight against fame.</LD>
<LD>   For the past 35 years, the New York street photographer led a
carefully private life in a modest apartment, four flights up in a
Greenwich Village brownstone. Her pictures, celebrated by critics as
a uniquely unvarnished record of New York life, settled in the
important American museums, while she famously declined invitations
to interpret her work. She gave almost no interviews, and her
visitors--an exclusive subset of the New York art world--were
long-standing and protective friends.</LD>
<LD>   But in recent months, as the world groped for insight into the
essence of New York, attention landed repeatedly on Levitt's iconic
street scenes. Fifty-nine years after she received a solo exhibition
at the Museum of Modern Art, Levitt is the new toast of the town.</LD>
<TE>   The "supreme poet-photographer of the streets and people of New
York," as the New Yorker magazine put it in November; "one of the
living treasures of New York," declared the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of praise has been fanned by the coincidental release
of "Crosstown" (PowerHouse), the largest collection of Levitt's work.
The book stretches from her tender images of Spanish Harlem in the
1930s--children playing in the water of an opened hydrant, teenagers
flirting on a townhouse stoop--to the tragicomic bustle of the
near-bankrupt city in the 1970s. Together, they reflect her singular
vision of New York: a city defined best in minor mysteries and
gestures, where women gossip while leaning out of apartment windows
so often that they place pillows on the frames and old men are caught
ogling store mannequins.</TE>
<TE>   After 60 years of insisting her images speak for themselves,
Levitt permits occasional visitors these days, as long as they
promise to talk loudly and not to pose the most noxious question of
all: What do the pictures mean?</TE>
<TE>   "I never intend to make statements in my pictures," she said one
recent afternoon, fingering a small glass of sherry, as rain pounded
the street outside.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are doing street work, you don't have to talk to
people."</TE>
<TE>   It is not that Levitt does not like to talk. She just prefers that
it be about something other than her. The feeling runs deeper than
privacy, reflecting a fundamental aversion to pretense, the belief
that good things can be ruined with fancy explanations.</TE>
<TE>   "People say, 'What does this or that mean?' And I don't have a
good answer for them. You see what you see," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Padding lightly around the apartment she shares with her cat,
Binky Levitt wears a purple sweatshirt and a light silk scarf around
her neck. Her hair is styled in a cropped brown pageboy. Her smile is
warm but hard-won; she rewards jokes that are good.</TE>
<TE>   Though she has produced thousands of images since first picking up
a camera in 1936, there are none to be found on the walls of her
home.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about her favorite piece of art, Levitt folds back the
narrow door of her galley kitchen to reveal a small cutout copy of a
painting by Jean-Simeon Chardin, the 18th century Frenchman known for
pioneering scenes of everyday life.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't this beautiful?" she says. "So simple."</TE>
<TE>   Levitt was born in Brooklyn in 1913, the middle of three children.
Her older brother, Robert, who died in 1998, went on to become a
physician and chief of medicine at Grant Hospital in Chicago. Her
younger brother, William, is the mayor of Alta, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Social Issues Were</TE>
<TE>   an Early Interest</TE>
<TE>   The Levitts grew up in Bensonhurst--the neighborhood from the "The
Honeymooners"--and her twisted vowels carry a hint of Ralph Kramden.</TE>
<TE>   Levitt dropped out of high school before her senior year and got a
job with a commercial photographer in the Bronx.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be an artist but I couldn't draw," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Like others in a budding group of New York photographers at the
time, Levitt began her career with an agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "I was interested in social issues, so I thought I should start by
taking pictures of working-class people to show the conditions of
everything," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "What changed was that I saw the photographs of Henri
Cartier-Bresson and I realized that photographs could stand up by
themselves without a purpose. They could be art."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by Cartier-Bresson's Paris street scenes, Levitt set out
on the first of her neighborhood trips through Manhattan, Brooklyn
and the Bronx.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with the same 35-millimeter Leica model that Cartier-Bresson
favored, she roamed the streets and alleys of Spanish Harlem and
Manhattan's Lower East Side. She lingered on sidewalks, beside stoops
and in empty lots as life unfolded around her. Much of the time, she
used a right-angle viewfinder, a gadget that lets the photographer
shoot one way while facing another.</TE>
<TE>   The results were at once intimate and unsentimental. Two women
exchanging serious words, one with her hand pressed to her chest,
while each gazes somewhere over the other one's shoulder. An old
black man cradling a newborn white baby in his massive forearms.
Chalk graffiti in careful cursive: "Bill Jones Mother is a Hore."</TE>
<TE>   Her New Yorkers were drunks, flirts, braggarts and wonderers. She
sought neither heroes nor villains. She subverted the usual logic of
candid photography by capturing moments that were not unbelievable
and thoroughly familiar, the distilled expression of things we all
recognize to be true.</TE>
<TE>   Levitt's world, in the words of art critic Ellen Handy, is one of
"magically odd juxtapositions."</TE>
<TE>   "She includes much of the same information that you see in
documentary photographs, but her project is much more personal,
poetic and eccentric," says Handy, who curated a Levitt exhibition in
1997 at New York's International Center of Photography.</TE>
<TE>   "She always says, 'A good picture is a good picture,' even when
she knows she is dealing with some of the most complex and elaborate
and existential qualities of the moment."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Levitt's most recognizable photographs are of kids in
masks and face paint, absorbed in the theatrics of their own
amusement. Bubble-blowing, tree-climbing, skirt-lifting kids, they
are the unself-conscious players in a street drama that never seems
to end.</TE>
<TE>   "That was before television and air-conditioning," Levitt says.
"People would be outside, and if you just waited long enough, they
forgot about you."</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, Levitt took those pictures to meet Walker Evans, marking
the start of a long, mutually influential friendship. Indeed, it was
Levitt who, the following year, accompanied Evans--a prep-schooled
dandy from Kenilworth, N.J.--into the New York subway, where he would
make some his most oft-cited pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The memory of those days sends Levitt rooting through drawers for
a prop.</TE>
<TE>   "He would loop it over his neck like this," she said, using a
small point-and-click camera to re-create Evans' method of shooting
undetected in a subway car. "He would rest the camera on his chest,
this way, and run a cable through his shirt and out his sleeve. It
was pretty damn clever."</TE>
<TE>   Through Evans, Levitt also met author James Agee, with whom she
became a frequent collaborator.</TE>
<TE>   Their sublime 1952 film "In the Street," shot with Levitt's friend
Janice Loeb, gave life to many of the neighborhood scenes familiar
from her still photos, and helped cement Levitt's reputation as a
film editor as well.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Levitt doesn't go out to shoot in the streets much.
She is still getting used to the idea of talking about her previous
work. Besides, her passion these days is photographing farm animals
as far away from the city as possible.</TE>
<TE>   She knows the subject stands to generate less deep thinking from
the art types. And she doesn't care.</TE>
<TE>   "I care about art, but it is not my main interest anymore. My main
interest is animals," she says, a sly smile broadening. "Why
shouldn't I take photographs of animals? They are beautiful just in
themselves."</TE>

<HD>The Usual Caper, a Better-Than-Usual Duo</HD>
<DH>Ice Cube and Mike Epps click nicely in the formulaic
'Benjamins' that has a bounty hunter joining forces with a con man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Applying the scruffy, slacker mood of "Friday" to a caper plot that
seems downloaded from Elmore Leonard's out basket seems presumptuous
at best. Yet "All About the Benjamins" shows this blend can go down
more smoothly than one would have imagined. Granted, its dark-edged
crime-caper plot is so formulaic it seems almost ritualized. Yet Ice
Cube and Mike Epps enact their standard odd-couple tango with such
ease and brio, you'd think they'd never seen such movies before. A
lot of generic thrillers could profit from their easy-does-it byplay.</LD>
<LD>   Scowling as implacably as ever, Ice Cube is Bucum (as in "book
'em") Jackson, a skip tracer for a lowlife Miami bail-bonds outfit,
whose ruthless efficiency in rounding up parole violators and other
lowlifes goes unappreciated by his boss. He'd love to set up his own
private-investigations company, but nothing short of a lottery win
will get him enough Benjamins (yes, we're talking hundreds) to pull
it off.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, con man Reggie Wright (Epps), who's high on Bucum's
to-do list, has actually won the $6-million lottery jackpot. But the
winning ticket is in his wallet. And the wallet is in the back of a
van used by a brother-sister tandem (Carmen Chaplin, Roger Guenveur
Smith) in a bloody diamond heist.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, Reggie wouldn't have even stowed away in the van if
Bucum hadn't chased him into the alley. And the diamonds turned out
to be fake. But, for the moment, all that's beside the point because
the killers and their wealthy boss (Tommy Flanagan) want Reggie dead
and the real diamonds recovered.</TE>
<TE>   The dots are all but connected in this script by Ice Cube and Ron
Lang. Along the way, there's a lot of brutal action that seems more
compatible with Mickey Spillane than with Leonard. But the two leads
ease both the predictability and the gore. Although his glower may
seem have a patent-pending label by now, Ice Cube shows greater
confidence and flexibility as a leading man. His comic timing, though
not as precise as it could be, is adjusting nicely to the demands of
mainstream genre.</TE>
<TE>   Epps' motor-mouth persona has drawn obvious--read:
"lazy"--comparisons with Chris Tucker, Jamie Foxx, Martin Lawrence
and, of course, early Eddie Murphy. But while cheap laughs are all
alike, motor-mouth comic actors are alike in different ways. With
Epps, there's a street-level vulnerability to his shtick that just
doesn't materialize on Tucker's super-slick hard drive. Unlike most
Murphy clones, Epps often talks as if most of his jokes and insults
were picked up from real life instead of the TV set. His fizz is a
natural contrast to Ice Cube's sourness, yet he could, with time,
become his own best foil.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R for strong violence, pervasive language and brief
sexuality. Times guidelines: not for younger teens.</TE>

<HD>What the Blonds Prefer</HD>
<DH>It's all about the women in 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,' a
Reprise! revival greatly helped by a charismatic Alice Ripley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The title may sound antiquated, yet the 1949 musical "Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes" was never really about what gentlemen want.</LD>
<LD>   It's about what the siren Lorelei Lee wants--to bag a wealthy
husband. And the practice of screening potential spouses for their
moola has not been completely banished from the 21st century--or from
certain social strata in L.A.</LD>
<LD>   So while the fizzy Reprise! revival of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,"
at UCLA's Freud Playhouse, is set in the '20s, it isn't from a
completely different universe. That's why a surprising percentage of
the jokes hit their targets--that, plus the fact that they're
delivered by Alice Ripley.</LD>
<TE>   Ripley plays Lorelei, who was created on stage by Carol Channing
and played in the much more familiar 1953 movie by Marilyn Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   Ripley is no Monroe clone, but her looks are, well, charismatic.
She could ignite a sudden interest in musical comedy among certain
heterosexual men.</TE>
<TE>   Some of her poses adopt the Monroe style. She narcissistically
sings "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" in front of a full-length
mirror, while two hunky guys keep enhancing her initially skimpy
outfit with additional items of glittery jewelry, each of which
sparks little paroxysms of pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ripley wisely shuns Monroe's breathy vocal quality. This is
a stage musical, after all--its star needs a bigger sound, which
Ripley delivers, even adding a quasi-bluesy growl occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   The stage Lorelei is also a somewhat more substantial character
than the movie version. The stage script was written by Joseph Fields
and Anita Loos, and this Lorelei tells us more of her personal
history--she shot a cad back home in Arkansas. She's less of a cream
puff. And near the end, Lorelei executes some financial wizardry that
would have baffled her movie counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   It would still be a mistake to use this production as a
fund-raiser for the National Organization for Women. But even NOW
members might enjoy an exchange in which the heir Henry Spofford
(Hugh Panaro) discusses how he might have to get a job. When his
girlfriend (Valarie Pettiford, in the Jane Russell role from the
movie) sympathizes, he points out that she works (as a chorine). Of
course, she replies--she's a girl. Pettiford, whose long limbs and
sultry voice are best known from "Fosse," smoothly handles the tart
retorts of Lorelei's loyal but less venal friend.</TE>
<TE>   Panaro's role isn't as interesting as the two very different roles
into which it was divided in the movie; here he's simply an Arrow
Shirt-style straight-shooter. Spofford's main dramatic attribute is
that his voice "sure packs a wallop," says his girlfriend, and
Panaro's tenor meets those expectations.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of supporting players enhances the comedy. Ian
Abercrombie is at his most elfin as an English sugar daddy, while
Ruth Williamson successfully staggers through the role of his sloshed
wife. Tom Beyer projects scrappy resilience as Lorelei's rich beau,
and Greg Zerkle is amusingly pompous as his rival. The script also
gets off some licks about their business rivalry--Beyer's character
is a button company heir, while Zerkle's big lug is attempting to
dethrone buttons with the newfangled zipper. Kimberly Lyon generates
a few chuckles as an oddball chorus girl who practices her dancing
nonstop.</TE>
<TE>   Dixieland orchestrations of the sprightly Jule Styne and Leo Robin
score and Bill Hargate's spangly costumes place the action in the
'20s at its most roaring. In a Reprise! first, the onstage band is on
two moving platforms, allowing more flexibility for director John
Bowab's blocking.</TE>
<TE>   Bowab and musical director Peter Matz streamlined the script,
replacing the character of Spofford's mother with references to his
father, who is represented only by a big snoring sound effect. They
also enlisted an audience member to speak two lines as the minister
in the climactic wedding.</TE>
<TE>   That wedding is supposed to be followed by a brief reprise of
"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," but on opening night a premature
lighting blackout precluded it, making the final moment of the show
seem abrupt.</TE>

<HD>'Burn This' Dances With Loss and Love's Renewing Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lanford Wilson's "Burn This" is a moody, delicate piece of writing
that in many ways, behaves more like a chamber quartet--or a
dance--than a play. Constructed of themes and variations on loss,
grief and the renewing power of love, it speaks directly to the
heart.</LD>
<LD>   That's a difficult thing to get right, but all of the elements
align in a revival by Michaela Productions, in rented space at the
Odyssey Theatre. What's more, the time is again right for this piece.
When introduced at the Mark Taper Forum in 1987, the play indirectly
addressed the sadness that had descended on America with the AIDS
crisis. Today, it quietly speaks to the losses of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The death that propels the play's action is nothing so pervasive
or catastrophic. It's just the everyday variety, which sends every
life it touches into a tailspin.</LD>
<TE>   A gifted young dancer and his lover have been killed in a boating
accident--a loss that hits his roommate and dance collaborator Anna
(Christina Carlisi) particularly hard. She is surrounded by kind,
sensitive men--her other roommate, Larry (David Brouwer), and her
rich, too-perfect boyfriend, Burton (Blake Boyd)--who try to joke or
comfort away her pain. But it isn't until the dead dancer's older
brother, Pale (Dean Biasucci), bursts into Anna's life that she
connects with someone whose emotions are as raw as her own.</TE>
<TE>   Director Jessica Kubzansky and her actors infuse each passage with
subtle shades of meaning. In a wonderfully appropriate touch, this
production incorporates bits of modern dance to illustrate Anna's
feelings and to allow the audience to see, not just hear about, the
piece she has created in response to what has happened. The
choreography--which suggests togetherness and separation, attraction
and repulsion--is by Kitty McNamee.</TE>
<TE>   The action feels right at home in Yael Pardess' design for a
tall-windowed loft space in lower Manhattan, while Jeremy Pivnick's
lighting infuses the sky beyond those windows with the pinkish-blue
dawn of new hope.</TE>

<TE>   'RUNT' Confronts Fear in Taut, Moving Monologue</TE>
<TE>   When you walk into a room where no one knows you, what pulls your
head up--assurance? Or fear?</TE>
<TE>   Posing that litmus test of inner strength and admitting that most
of his life has been driven by the latter, writer-actor Michael
Phillip Edwards proceeds to explore and do battle with that fear in
his taut, harrowing monologue, "RUNT, a Hero's Journey" at the L.A.
Gay &amp; Lesbian Center's Davidson/Valentini Theatre (venue
notwithstanding, the show is not gay-themed).</TE>
<TE>   The self-styled runt in a lineage of strong black men of
"self-made fortunes--and cursed to the bone," Edwards was inspired by
the birth of his son to craft this unsparing personal history in an
attempt to avoid repeating deep-seated patterns of psychological
abuse by confronting them.</TE>
<TE>   In a meticulous characterization, Edwards conjures up the bullying
presence of his father, a Jamaican immigrant for whom weakness was
the only unforgivable sin. Snapshots of their tortured relationship
from Edwards' early childhood through adulthood explore telling
facets of child-rearing through intimidation and the sobering
consequences. Sharply focused staging by Kimberly Elise ensures
presentational mechanics (notably Sandy Lee's evocative lighting
shifts and Drew Dalzell's  design) and support the material without
intruding on it.</TE>
<TE>   At what point does self-exploration stop being psychotherapy and
become theater? Where all too many solo shows fall short of that
transformation, Edwards' skillful writing and compelling performance
consistently invest the specifics of his narrative with universal
resonance.</TE>
<TE>   Whether invoking the Oedipal terrors of a 5-year-old forced to
choose between his separated parents, or the humiliation of a college
student at a financial low point tempted with money at the cost of
his personal integrity, Edwards' quest for manhood often achieves the
mythic stature the play's subtitle implies.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, Edwards impresses with the strength of his
commitment. The thick drops of sweat he leaves behind on the stage
testify that nothing has been held back.</TE>

<HD>Abortion Foes Prevail on Two Soaps</HD>
<DH>NBC's 'Days of Our Lives' and 'Passions' take strong
stances, but the network says it's coincidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRY STANLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rape, trickery, lies and pregnancies are all in a day's soap opera
but, in the case of NBC's two daytime dramas lately, so are
impassioned speeches about protecting the unborn.</LD>
<LD>   In "Days of Our Lives," a young character tells her male friend
she wants to have an abortion after learning she's pregnant after a
violent rape. The friend pleads against it, saying, "You can't kill
your baby." He then offers to marry her and pretend the child is his.
She agrees.</LD>
<LD>   Another young character, on "Passions," wants to have an abortion
when she learns she's pregnant by a conniving older character who
plied her with alcohol and took advantage of her while she was
semi-conscious. Her mother becomes hysterical when she learns of the
planned abortion, saying it's a sin to take an innocent life. The
character doesn't go through with it, but she's so distraught about
the pregnancy that she throws herself off a bridge.</LD>
<TE>   Daytime Dramas Have Tackled Subject Before</TE>
<TE>   Abortion has been used as story fodder for daytime dramas since
1971, when "All My Children's" Erica Kane was one of the first
television characters to have one. And while abortion remains a
rarely employed option in most of television, including prime time,
"Days" and "Passions" have taken what appears to be a
stronger-than-usual anti-abortion stance.</TE>
<TE>   According to NBC, it's coincidental that both shows have broached
the same prickly subject.</TE>
<TE>   "Could the audience infer a preferred choice through how these
story lines are playing out? Maybe," said Sheraton Kalouria, senior
vice president of daytime programs at NBC. "But that's not our
intent. The network and the shows resolutely do not take a position
on this issue."</TE>
<TE>   For all the sex on daytime dramas and the pregnancies that
sometimes result, abortion is still a hot-button topic--so touchy
that Kalouria said he made sure to consult with the network's
standards and practices executives early on about "Days" and
"Passions."</TE>
<TE>   One story began last summer, the other is more recent. In each
case, the pregnancy stories were hatched to further other plot twists
and complicate characters' lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Soaps don't tackle abortion often, but characters have done it.
We weren't telling that story," he said. "These are about turning
points."</TE>
<TE>   Media buyers say each advertiser has its own roster of taboo
subjects and, for many, abortion is consistently at the top of the
hands-off list.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a contentious issue," said Guy McCarter, vice president
of entertainment at the New York-based ad agency BBDO. "There are a
number of advertisers who don't want to be in episodes that deal with
it, whether it's daytime or prime time."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kalouria said the stories, not the ad market, are driving
the "Days" and "Passions" she's-keeping-the-baby plots.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be disingenuous to suggest that advertiser concerns
didn't play a part," Kalouria said. "But they always do."</TE>
<TE>   When writers tread into sensitive territory, particularly in
daytime, networks require them to have characters discussing all
sides of an issue. On "Days," Shawn, played by Jason Cook, asked his
friend if she would consider giving the baby up for adoption. They
also visited a Planned Parenthood-type clinic. Shawn was insistent on
one point, though: no abortion. He was the sole confidant of his
pregnant friend, Jan, played by Heather Lauren Olson.</TE>
<TE>   "Passions," best known for its cartoonish witch and talking doll
characters and fantasy sequences, has crucifix-wearing, church-going
Theresa agonizing over her pregnancy. It's made worse when her
fiance, who doesn't know about it, talks incessantly about the joy of
children and how he can't wait until they have a brood of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Characters Rarely Face the Question</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, soaps often spare characters from the abortion
question. When there's an unwanted pregnancy, more often than not,
characters have miscarriages.</TE>
<TE>   But not always. Susan Lucci's Erica Kane, on ABC's "All My
Children," was the highest-profile soap character to have an
abortion, in keeping with show creator and soap icon Agnes Nixon's
approach of tackling social issues. With a second unwanted pregnancy,
Erica gave that baby up for adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Daytime shows have often been more daring than their prime-time
counterparts in dealing with abortion, with rare series such as
"Maude" and "China Beach" as well as NBC's fact-based made-for-TV
movie "Roe v. Wade" kicking up protests and advertiser pull-outs.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, popular shows ranging from NBC's "Friends" to HBO's
"Sex and the City" (which, notably, doesn't have to worry about
advertisers) have featured characters deciding to keep out-of-wedlock
babies. Unwed mothers no longer cause the dust-up they once did, when
fictional journalist Murphy Brown drew the ire of then-Vice President
Dan Quayle in 1992, setting off a national debate about single
motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Daytime has returned to the topic many times with varying
approaches. A character on CBS' "The Young and the Restless" had an
abortion, then went crazy as a result. A young "All My Children"
character walked a gantlet of protesters at a clinic before sticking
to her decision to have an abortion in the early '90s. That pregnancy
was the result of a rape.</TE>
<TE>   Soaps tend to stay away from politics--characters don't talk
current events--but social issues are a staple of the more serious
shows. Everything from fetal alcohol syndrome and interracial
marriages to homophobia and domestic abuse has been addressed.</TE>
<TE>   "They get good press, and it makes them feel good to deal with
social issues," said Michael Logan, contributing editor and soap
columnist for TV Guide. "But abortion seems to be the one bugaboo."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Days of Our Lives" and "Passions" are seen locally at 1 and 2
p.m. weekdays, respectively, on NBC.</TE>

<HD>In 'Last Man,' Denial Survives Apocalypse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN STUART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fat, homely men who feel they have been wrongly underrepresented in
underwear ads should flock to "The Last Man." There are no underwear
campaigns in the film, as such, although frequent sightings of a fat,
homely anthropologist in Jockey shorts may move some of the more
open-minded and stronger-stomached in the audience to start a run on
Calvin Klein briefs.</LD>
<LD>   Product placement and unappetizing nudity are the least of the
sins committed by "The Last Man," an end-of-the-world romantic comedy
that has a lot else to answer for. The film's writer and director,
Harry Ralston, could begin by explaining why he thought that anyone
would want to be held hostage for 90 minutes by a stridently
self-absorbed tribal researcher, Alan (David Arnott), whose talent
for denial outstretches even his waistline.</LD>
<LD>   He could then help us understand why he chose to mediate much of
Alan's hapless plight through video. Alan, you see, discovers that he
has inexplicably survived a mysterious agent that has killed off
nearly all of the Earth's population. So he breaks into a camera shop
and makes off with state-of-the-art equipment with which to record
his experiences and admonitions for the benefit of future cultures
that are either very bored or very stupid.</LD>
<TE>   It is through Alan's ever-watchful camera that we see our chatty
host seduce a voluptuous survivor named Sarah (Jeri Ryan), the sort
of bodacious babe who would not give him a tumble if the competition
were still breathing. And it is through Alan's increasingly paranoid
surveillance that we see Sarah swept away by a third survivor, a
dashing and genial meathead named Raphael (Dan Montgomery).</TE>
<TE>   The omnipresent video perspective, coupled with the
clueless-trio-alone-in-the-wild motif, is more than a little redolent
of "The Blair Witch Project." Frankly, "The Last Man" is much
scarier. Narcissism and myopia are terrifying to behold as embodied
by Alan, who doesn't buy the truth even when it's rewound and played
back to him, and the pathologically co-dependent Sarah, who genuinely
believes her conduct toward others caused the recent apocalypse.</TE>
<TE>   This may be Ralston's point. There may even be some relationship
truisms to be gleaned from his triangular mating charades. But his
observations, for all the video hocus-pocus, are neither as acute nor
as risible as we're asked to think they are. And being trapped in a
Winnebago with Arnott's babbling Lothario, in or out of his Jockey
shorts, is a kind of living damnation that even Dante or Sartre could
not have conceived.</TE>

<HD>Romance and Deal-Making High Jinks Unfold in 'Festival in
Cannes'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Jaglom's "Festival in Cannes" is a giddy comic fantasy, full of
romance, chicanery and beguiling, sophisticated players. No doubt
much of the behind-the-scenes maneuvering Jaglom depicts has or could
happen during the world's most famous film festival. What he's done
is to put all the pieces together to create a classic farce and, as
he has done so often before, found in effervescent artifice a context
rich in humor and emotion.</LD>
<LD>   A dizzying plot is set in motion with the arrival of a glamorous
icon of the French cinema, Millie Marquand, played by real-life icon
Anouk Aimee. The radiantly beautiful Marquand is to receive a tribute
to her illustrious career, but she quickly becomes the center of
unexpected intrigue. A well-respected but frustrated actress, Alice
Palmer (Greta Scacchi), has already arrived with two young associates
(Kim Kolarich and Rachel Bailit) hoping to get financing for her
script, which she intends to direct.</LD>
<TE>   The script is about a Midwestern wife and mother who's been taken
for granted by her family and now wants to rediscover herself.
Swooping down on the three women is a brash wheeler-dealer, Kaz
Naiman (Zack Norman), who assures them he'll get the money for their
project. Alice dismisses him as a jerk, but he returns with the news
that he's set up a meeting for her with Marquand. Alice, who had Gena
Rowlands in mind, thinks her script could be retooled for Millie,
whom she admires deeply.</TE>
<TE>   What Alice doesn't know is that Kaz has preempted a meeting with
Marquand set up by hotshot (but actually desperate and hard-strapped)
Hollywood producer Rick Yorkin (Ron Silver). Yorkin has lined up Tom
Hanks for a project provided he land a certain young French actress
as his leading lady; the actress in turn has agreed--provided
Marquand plays her mother. (Peter Bogdanovich's Milo is in line to
direct.)</TE>
<TE>   So Millie, whose career has slowed down lately, has a choice: a
meaty role in a small, personal picture or yet another small,
meaningless role in a high-profile $90-million Hollywood movie for
big bucks. In a quandary, Millie turns for advice to her charming
playboy husband, Viktor Kovner (Maximilian Schell), a prestigious
European director who's run through his wife's money. Viktor hasn't
worked for a long time but tends to return to the ever-loving and
endlessly forgiving Millie. Viktor has turned up at the festival with
his latest protegee, a sexy Italian starlet (Camilla Campanale) on
his arm.</TE>
<TE>   Also on hand at Cannes is Blue (Jenny Gabrielle), shy and pretty
star of a tiny indie film that has created a buzz at the festival.
She's caught the eye of Yorkin's opportunistic assistant, Barry (Alex
Craig Mann); like his boss, Barry is not above using seduction as a
means to an end.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the film is Alice's eloquent lament to Millie on how
Hollywood uses actresses and casts them off when they hit 45. She
thinks women should reject men's view of them and see themselves
enriched by the passage of time. Millie gently points out, "There are
losses, " but she feels renewed by Millie's sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   Jaglom is well known for providing his cast with only a skeleton
script and giving them little time to prepare, which requires his
actors to dig into themselves to flesh out the people they're
playing. Jaglom is expert at picking players up to this challenge,
and the results are highly rewarding when the actors are as skilled
as Aimee, Scacchi, Schell, Silver and Norman; younger players such as
Mann and Gabrielle are no less impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Jaglom's usual cinematographer, Hanania Baer, bathes the cast and
the legendary resort setting with natural light, and the effect is
honest rather than unflattering: Aimee's remarkable bone structure
looks as beautiful in daylight as on a studio set.</TE>
<TE>   The film's jaunty pace is accompanied by a clutch of vintage
French pop tunes, many of them standards by the late Charles Trenet,
to whom the film is dedicated. It seems unlikely that the scheming
and seductions of a real-life big-time film festival could ever play
out with the artistic unity and poetic justice of "Festival in
Cannes." The charm of the film is that it  leaves us thinking that if
things don't actually happen quite that way at Cannes, they should.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for brief, strong language. Times guidelines:
The film is for sophisticated audiences, including older teens.</TE>

<HD>'Time Machine' Has a Split Personality</HD>
<DH>The film creates a visually rich setting but takes a sudden
and disconcerting turn in the second half.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given how troublesome regular travel is, time travel, especially over
a span of 800,000 years, has got to be even more disorienting. Which
perhaps explains why "The Time Machine" has ended up such an odd,
haphazard concoction.</LD>
<LD>   Based on the celebrated 1895 H.G. Wells novella, "Time Machine"
was previously filmed by George Pal in 1960 in a much-loved Rod
Taylor-Yvette Mimieux version that the new one makes several
references to. This "Time Machine" has an even stronger connection to
the past: Its director, Simon Wells, is H.G.'s great-grandson.</LD>
<LD>   But, as both Pal and the current team discovered, the original
book, as much a class-conscious sociopolitical tract as a
science-fiction novel, was rather thin on plot, to the point of
calling its protagonist nothing more than "the Time Traveler." This
new version (written by John Logan and "based on the [1960]
screenplay by David Duncan"-- a rarely seen credit) has
understandably worked hard to remedy that situation. Perhaps too
hard. So much effort has been put into creating a believable world
for the traveler to come from and a creditable back story for his
trip that what happens 800,000 years in the future seems to belong to
a completely different--and less interesting--picture.</LD>
<TE>   "Time Machine" opens in turn-of-the-century New York and focuses
on Dr. Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce), a young professor of applied
mechanics and engineering at Columbia University. He's very much the
absent-minded genius type, corresponding with Albert Einstein and
inventing the electric toothbrush in the time he has left over from
covering large blackboards with mathematical equations complex enough
to daunt "A Beautiful Mind's" John Nash.</TE>
<TE>   Respectably played by Pearce in rather a breathless, White Rabbit
mode, Alex has both the requisite best friend (Mark Addy) and
no-nonsense housekeeper (Phyllida Law, Emma Thompson's redoubtable
mother). He's also madly in love with the beautiful Emma (Sienna
Guillory), "the only thing in my entire life," he says, "I've never
had to think about."</TE>
<TE>   Though this part of "Time Machine" is in truth not much more than
a prologue, director Wells (an animator who co-directed "The Prince
of Egypt") has such a strong visual sense that he's taken a
surprising amount of care with the film's look. Created with the help
of cinematographer Donald M. McAlpine, production designer Oliver
Scholl and set decorator Victor Zolfo, "Time Machine" persuasively
and very pleasantly recreates both Alex's library and the snowy
environs of old New York.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true for Alex's beautiful Time Machine, as impressive
as its 6,000-pound weight would indicate. Built of aluminum and
polycarbonate to mimic brass and glass, it also consciously echoes
the 1960 film's wondrous mechanism.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to give Alex a Screenwriting 101 motive for building
the apparatus, the film has something bad happen to Emma, something
that causes Alex to end up traveling back and forth in time to see if
he can correct. In borderline pointless diversions, Alex makes stops
in 2030 and 2037. These trips do allow for some nifty time-lapse
photography that includes a tribute to the original's shifting
hemlines montage. They also introduce the film's most amusing
character, Vox (Orlando Jones), a holographic compendium of all human
knowledge who, without much prompting, sings, "There's a place called
tomorrow" from a musical version of the Wells novel.</TE>
<TE>   Up to now "Time Machine" has been a slight, pleasantly
old-fashioned diversion. It's at this point, however, that Alex
unintentionally lurches all those years into the future and into the
heart of Wells' tale. What he finds is anything but pleasant, and,
armed with this knowledge, the film changes tone completely. Humanity
has apparently split into two different races, the tree-hugging Eloi,
epitomized by the fetching Mara (Irish recording artist Samantha
Mumba), and the nasty and brutish Morlocks, led by the snarling
Uber-Morlock (Jeremy Irons made up like a demented version of rock
star Edgar Winter).</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of this section is a busy action sequence of
partially animatronic Morlocks running around and terrorizing the
Eloi. It's acceptably done, but the violent, unpleasant tone is so at
variance with the rest of the film that it's more disconcerting than
anything else, as if "The Little Princess" had suddenly morphed into
"Rollerball."</TE>
<TE>   If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting
in two, he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's
movie splitting up in pretty much the same way.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of action violence.
Times guidelines: fairly gruesome action, especially in the second
half.</TE>

<HD>A Shattering 'Crucible' for Our Times</HD>
<DH>On Broadway, small details and big-picture context are
layered in a revelatory staging of Arthur Miller's drama.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA WINER</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As high-school drama clubs and community theaters well know, it is
hard to go wrong with "The Crucible." What has been easy to forget
through the earnest decades, however, is how shattering Arthur
Miller's 1953 witch-hunt parable can be when gifted professionals get
it right.</LD>
<LD>   And do they ever now. Richard Eyre's production, which opened
Thursday night at the Virginia Theatre with Liam Neeson, Laura
Linney, Brian Murray and a big, consummate ensemble, is both massive
and humane, as much a chiseled monument as a gut-bucket suspense
story. How unexpectedly subtle it is--Miller's weighty metaphor about
witch trials in 17th century Salem and the state-sanctioned hunts for
Communists in the 1950s. How firmly, yet how gracefully, his sturdy
words and warnings still hold the stage.</LD>
<LD>   Press columns are sure to be filled with revelations about the
familiar drama's resonant timeliness, about yet another world ripe
for righteous hysteria, with vanishing lines between church and
state, with orders for unimpeachable tribunals to rid the world of,
yes, "evil," and with the temptation to cry "terrorist" as
promiscuously as the Salem citizens cried "witch" and Joe McCarthy
cried "Commie."</LD>
<TE>   If all this sounds preachy and theoretical, forget you read it.
The play that came up sixth on the Royal National Theatre's
millennial survey of 100 important plays (Miller's "Death of a
Salesman" was first) is the visceral, zonking, theatrical equivalent
of a gripping page-turner.</TE>
<TE>   Eyre, who ran London's National Theatre during some of its headier
recent years, clearly cherishes the detailed intimacies as much as
the big-picture moral context. Tim Hatley's settings help us
understand the raw, hard life in the Massachusetts wilderness, 1692.
A huge, sobering wall of window panes descends between scenes, a
low-tech surveillance symbol for societies that devalue privacy.
Hatley's costumes for the good people of Salem are boxy and
shapeless, although Eyre warms things up for a moment by having
Neeson's John Proctor peel off his big old farmer shirt for a wash
before dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Proctor, of course, is the uneasy hero of the drama, an ordinary
man whose moment of weakness with a teenage housekeeper, the
manipulative and pretty Abigail Williams, leads to public
denunciations of lechery and the mob rule that condemns his wife,
Mary (Linney), as a witch. Neeson, unforgettable on Broadway in "Anna
Christie" and an unconventional Oscar Wilde in "Judas Kiss," manages
to be both lug and hunk, an unpretentious laborer with a nobility
streak and a voice that seems to growl melodically through the
tunnels and caverns of his conspicuously formidable being.</TE>
<TE>   Linney, who was a New York theater treasure long before Hollywood
found her, finds the flinty heat within the disappointed wife's wary
restraint, which means she is more than just a scold before she gets
to turn transcendent with such dignity and heart.</TE>
<TE>   Although Eyre has Abigail talk with something curiously like an
Irish accent--perhaps an English signal of class struggle?--Angela
Bettis is persuasive as the needy young woman with the tenacity and
hunger to stick to her increasingly outlandish and deadly devices.
Murray, as Deputy Governor Danforth, does not even enter until midway
through the three-hour evening, but his delicious unctuousness takes
its rightful place in the self-justifying proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The populous production, which lists almost as many producers as
actors, includes Tom Aldredge as an achingly irascible, litigious
Giles Corey, and Helen Stenborg as the saintly but earthy Rebecca
Nurse. John Benjamin Hickey makes the Rev. Hale's moral flip-flops
seem as passionate as they are confused, while Christopher Evan
Welch's greedy Rev. Parris is so emotionally naked that he cannot
bother to hide his violent streak.</TE>
<TE>   Eyre has Parris slap the face of Tituba (Patrice Johnson), the
slave he brought back from Barbados. The literal stroke makes sure we
don't forget to add slavery and non-Christian, Afro-Caribbean
religion to the impact of the night Tituba and the town's girls went
to the forest to dance naked and conjure up the dead. When Rebecca's
husband reports her to the church for reading books, we can add
society's fear of women who think for themselves. And, always, there
is the allure of other people's property to make some people care too
much about seeing their neighbors hang.</TE>
<TE>   As the naming and blaming get out of hand, Danforth is moved to
remind the citizens, "We no longer live in the dusky afternoon when
evil mixed itself with good and befuddled the world." Politicians and
clergy stress, "These are new times," by which they mean that old
laws are abandoned in pursuit of national security.</TE>
<TE>   Miller wrote this 50 years ago. And I'm bewitched.</TE>

<HD>Elegance Shines Through Quartett Berlin Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In this tacky, tawdry world, real elegance comes too seldom. Yet it
materialized at the latest Chamber Music in Historic Sites event
Wednesday night when the Philharmonia Quartett Berlin played in the
Grand Salon aboard the Queen Mary in Long Beach Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   Everything about this performance bespoke an exalted level of
musical communication. And the setting--the series has visited the
handsome Grand Salon before--gave the playing an extra glow.</LD>
<LD>   The four members of the Berlin Philharmonic who make up the
ensemble--violinists Daniel Strabrawa and Christian Stadelmann,
violist Neithard Resa and cellist Jan Diesselhorst--displayed the
highest standards of technical accomplishment and artistic
single-mindedness. Their program, Mozart's Quartet No. 14, K. 387,
Hugo Wolf's Italian Serenade and Schubert's Quartet No. 15, had a
stunning depth and enough variety to satisfy the exacting listener.</LD>
<TE>   Except for some momentary roughness in Schubert's slow movement,
the quartet realized the expressive possibilities in his initially
quirky, finally seraphic work. It did the same for Mozart's
aristocratic and similarly broad emotional canvas. In between, a
different temperamental world came to life in the joys and jauntiness
of Wolf's single chamber piece, the irresistible Italian Serenade.</TE>

<HD>Country Radio Is Now 'Music of the Suburbs'</HD>
<DH>Shania Twain and Faith Hill now rule the roost as country
stations prefer a contemporary sound that helps sell advertising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Country music radio is no longer discernible from pop, and station
programmers are playing it safe while ignoring the genre's rich
roots.</LD>
<LD>   That's not just the rant of some snobbish music purist, however,
but the view expressed by some programmers and executives themselves.</LD>
<LD>   "What Nashville is sending us is this pop. They're looking to
reach outside the core country audience," said R.J. Curtis, program
director at Los Angeles' KZLA-FM (93.9), the country-music station.
Stations are gearing toward women in their 20s, 30s and 40s--to
attract the advertisers that covet them--so running songs about
cheatin', drinkin', drivin' a truck and goin' to jail "doesn't fit
anymore," Curtis said. "It's become more of an AC [adult
contemporary] format."</LD>
<TE>   As a result, artists such as Shania Twain and Faith Hill rule the
airwaves, while Country Music Hall of Famers such as Johnny Cash and
Patsy Cline can't crack the lineup. So it looks as though the Soggy
Bottom Boys' "constant sorrow" will not let up.</TE>
<TE>   That fictional trio in the movie "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" got
its big chance when a blind radio-station owner put them on the air.
Last week the movie's soundtrack won three Grammy Awards in the
country-music category, as well as the coveted overall "Album of the
Year" prize--beating out U2, Bob Dylan, India.Arie and OutKast. The
record, with its touches of bluegrass, blues, folk and other
traditional forms found under the country-music banner, also has sold
more than 4 million copies--and all this with scant radio airplay.</TE>
<TE>   But even with the album's commercial and critical success,
country-music programmers say they would sooner let their babies grow
up to be cowboys then rethink their playlists.</TE>
<TE>   "Country radio is in a weird place. It severed itself from its
traditional roots. It said, 'We don't want that audience anymore,'"
said Grant Alden, co-editor of No Depression, a bimonthly magazine
covering alternative country and Americana music.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis said KZLA did give the "O Brother" album a chance, playing
the single "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow." Listeners rejected it,
saying it didn't mesh with the Brooks &amp; Dunn, Tim McGraw and Dixie
Chicks in heavy rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "We played it enough to get a very strong reaction, for our
listeners to tell us it was not a fit, and there was a 'high dislike'
on it. It's not like anything else played on the radio station,"
Curtis said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Billboard magazine's chart of radio airplay, the top
country songs in the nation (and also on KZLA) are "The Cowboy In Me"
by Tim McGraw, "The Long Goodbye" by Brooks &amp; Dunn, and "Bring On The
Rain" by Jo Dee Messina and Tim McGraw. "Man of Constant Sorrow"
isn't even in the top 60. At the same time, however, the "O Brother"
soundtrack was at No. 15 on the Billboard album chart, and shot to
No. 2 after its success at the Grammys.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure that country radio is going to respond by adding
more music like the 'O Brother' soundtrack," said Paul Allen,
executive director of Country Radio Broadcasters Inc., the industry's
trade group. "It's a genuine phenomenon, and phenomena are
unpredictable."</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Young, director of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum
in Nashville, said "O Brother's" success will probably help boost
sales of other traditional country music, and may yet have an impact
on radio.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think it's harder to drive radio now than it ever has been
before," Young said. "Radio is not exactly about music. They've got
to understand almost without doubt that it will produce revenue, that
it will support their business plans with ad dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Allen said commercial radio nowadays is all about leasing its
audience to advertisers. And that means country radio is trying to
sell more BMWs than pickup trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "Country music now, I suppose, is the music of the suburbs," Alden
said. "It used to be blue-collar. Clearly country music doesn't want
a working-class audience."</TE>
<TE>   In spite of the song's earlier reception, Curtis said he may try
spinning "Man of Constant Sorrow" again, advising his deejays to give
listeners a little background on the music, and warn them it will
sound different from what else they've heard that day.</TE>
<TE>   The crossover of country artists to the pop charts has come in
waves, and the last one in the early '90s, led by Garth Brooks,
George Strait and Brooks &amp; Dunn, pushed the likes of Willie Nelson,
Waylon Jennings and Dolly Parton off the airwaves, lost ground they
have yet to regain.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't find enough people out there who say they're interested
in stuff from the '70s and early '80s," Curtis said.</TE>
<TE>   Country music is still the dominant format on the airwaves, heard
on 21% of stations in the United States, compared with second-place
talk radio, at 11%. But ratings at country stations have dropped by
about one-third since 1995, and country's share of all albums sold
has also declined in that span.</TE>
<TE>   Alden predicted another wedge to break into programmers' playlists
and listeners' consciousness will come from specialty shows, either
syndicated or home-grown. For an hour or two, stations can spotlight
songs that initially may seem out of place during the rest of the
week's programming, giving listeners a chance to hear them and decide
if they want more.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the logic of not playing the 'O Brother' soundtrack,
up to a point," he said. "But if you're trying to get new listeners,
[and] if you're losing market share, why not try something new?"</TE>
<TE>   Rock 'n' roll music has its oldies and classic rock stations, but
traditional country stations are much harder to find. Earlier this
year in Abilene, Texas, Clear Channel Communications changed its
KEAN-AM to a traditional country format, while keeping that station's
FM counterpart contemporary country.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, though, Gaylord Communications pondered changing
Nashville's WSM-AM--the station that launched the Grand Ole Opry in
1925--to sports. The company reconsidered after much outcry, so
George Jones and Tammy Wynette still have a home on the airwaves in
Music City.</TE>
<TE>   "This music has an incredible tradition and an incredible
history," said the Hall of Fame's Young, "and in some ways it tells
the story of this country. We feel very strongly here that the past
gives the present meaning."</TE>

<HD>Masekela Accentuates His Influences in Right Setting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes settings can make the difference. Veteran South African
artist Hugh Masekela has performed all around the Southland in his
lengthy career, in recent years at the Hollywood Bowl and the House
of Blues.</LD>
<LD>   But his performance at the Conga Room on Wednesday night had the
feeling of the right artist in the right room. Not too big, like the
Bowl, not too loud, like the House of Blues, and filled with an
overflowing, enthusiastic crowd, the room had the perfect vibe, and
Masekela and his sextet responded accordingly.</LD>
<LD>   Having a hit early, as Masekela did with "Grazing in the Grass" in
1968 (when he was 29), has been known to lock performers into careers
of repetition. But the opposite has been true for Masekela, who has
surprised his fans with virtually every album, moving from jazz to
rock to soul to traditional music with every imaginable stop in
between.</LD>
<TE>   The one constant has been his deeply rooted connection with South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Even in albums clearly aimed at generating high sales, echoes of
Sharpeville, the townships, the mines, apartheid and Nelson Mandela
are always present somewhere, resonating throughout his music.</TE>
<TE>   The Conga Room set ranged widely: "Khawuleza" and "Chileshe" from
his 1999 album, "Black to the Future"; "Polina" from 1992's "Beatin'
Aroun' De Bush"; and, of course, "Grazing in the Grass." Masekela
sang and played with equal effectiveness on most of the numbers. His
fluegelhorn work sounded more adventurous, as well as more
controlled, than it has in recent years--once again reviving the
question of how his career as a jazz artist might have unfolded had
he concentrated solely on his instrumental art.</TE>
<TE>   But leaving Masekela's marvelous vocal work would have been an
even greater omission. Not only is he a fine, blues-based singer--as
he proved in his humorous exchanges with guitarist John Selolwane--he
also is an extraordinarily powerful story teller.</TE>
<TE>   His rendering of "Stimela," with its images of exploitation in the
diamond mines, seemed especially vivid in this performance. And the
spirited anthem "Nelson Mandela" still generated the sort of visceral
rallying force it possessed in the years before South African
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Masekela has often said that he is "the sum total of all my
influences." His Wednesday-night performance affirmed that fact, not
simply in terms of the multiplicity of currents flowing through his
music, but in his identity as an artist who is always acutely in
contact with the complexities of the world in which he lives.</TE>

<HD>'Cadet Kelly' Hits Family Target</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Disney Channel has drafted two of its regular performers for
fish-out-of-water duty at 8 tonight in the fun original movie "Cadet
Kelly."</LD>
<LD>   Hilary Duff (Disney's "Lizzie McGuire") stars as Kelly, a ditzy
Manhattan 14-year-old whose loosey-goosey life is turned on its ear
when her divorced mom (Linda Kash of "Best in Show") marries a
retired military man ("The Brady Bunch Movie's" Gary Cole). Before
long, the new family is uprooted to upstate New York, where Dad is
taking over as commandant of the century-old military academy that he
attended as a boy. And he has decided that if it was good enough for
him, it will be great for Kelly.</LD>
<LD>   With echoes of "Private Benjamin" and even "Gomer Pyle," Kelly is
thrust into an environment that couldn't be more alien to her than if
she had just stepped onto the moon. Kelly is soon coping with
crack-of-dawn wake-up calls, icky uniforms and muddy obstacle
courses, and she does it with a relentlessly cheery attitude that at
times nearly crosses into irritating. Sort of a junior Meg Ryan at
her crinkliest.</LD>
<TE>   But Kelly's biggest problem is Capt. Jennifer Stone (Christy
Carlson Romano of the Disney Channel's "Even Stevens"), who is
described by one cadet as "the meanest 16-year-old in America." They
clash at every turn, and the fact that they have designs on the same
soldier only makes for more trouble.</TE>
<TE>   But this is a Disney movie, and soon Kelly and Jennifer find
common ground, Dad begins to lighten up, and everyone learns a
crucial life lesson from everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "Cadet Kelly" isn't 21-gun-salute material, but as a glossy kids'
entertainment, it manages to put across a positive message and hit
its target.</TE>

<LD>Some were left standing in the rain on Sunset Boulevard on Wednesday
night as more than 100 friends and fans packed Book Soup to hear
legendary producer Robert Evans talk about his memoir, "The Kid Stays
in the Picture."</LD>
<LD>   "I've known him for 15 years and I can't get in," said Dan Ramsey,
52. Looking at the people in the rain, Ramsey said pensively, "He
knows a lot of people.'</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, many in the crowd were friends (or claimed to be) of
the 71-year-old who famously went from hotel guest to actor when he
was discovered by actress Norma Shearer in the 1950s at the Beverly
Hills Hotel swimming pool.</LD>
<TE>   Then, just as famously, he went from actor to studio chief at
Paramount, overseeing the making of "Rosemary's Baby," "Love Story,"
"Harold and Maude," "Serpico" and the "The Godfather" before a very
public fall from grace. A business partner was convicted of arranging
the murder of New York impresario Roy Radin in the notorious "Cotton
Club" case of the 1980s. Evans wasn't indicted.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way there were liaisons with Lana Turner, Grace Kelly,
Ali MacGraw, Raquel Welch and Margaux Hemingway.</TE>
<TE>   A new documentary on his life (with the same title as his 1994
memoir) screened at Sundance this year, prompting many in the crowd
to pronounce Evans the ultimate comeback kid. Another member of that
fraternity, Variety editor Peter Bart, made his way to the front and
stood among the young and the old during the 45-minute talk.</TE>
<TE>   Tina Barr, 25, an aspiring actress from Florida, mused that she
wished for "just half the life that he had." At the table at the
back, Evans said he was pleasantly surprised by the turnout. He
signed a book, then with characteristic voice and diction said,
"There are no highs or lows like this racket."</TE>
<TE>   Cultivating the</TE>
<TE>   'Wow Factor'</TE>
<TE>   Spero Plavoukos looked smooth in his gray suit, his hair slicked
back. He had the streamlined appearance of a man going places.</TE>
<TE>   And he was.</TE>
<TE>   Walking through the crowd at the Pacific Design Center on Tuesday
night, Plavoukos shook hands firmly as he greeted the two categories
of guests: friends and potential friends.</TE>
<TE>   Plavoukos is the right-hand man of restaurateur Charlie Palmer,
and in charge of Palmer's West Coast expansion: Astra, a venue for
upscale private parties that opened in January.</TE>
<TE>   Plavoukos' boss gained fame with the townhouse restaurant Aureole
on Manhattan's Upper East Side before expanding with his first Astra
in New York. The L.A. expansion, said Plavoukos, is not a stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "We're entertaining the same people on the two coasts," he said of
parties that have included fetes for movies, including "American
Pie," and private shindigs for Madonna. (Later, Madonna acolyte
Britney Spears breezed through.)</TE>
<TE>   On this night, the private party was a RealNetworks launch of new
technology for its Internet media service, with more than 500 guests
from all corners of the entertainment industry--music, TV, video
games, even the World Wrestling Federation--as evidenced by a range
of fashion from Adidas to Prada.</TE>
<TE>   Plavoukos beamed, explaining what he called Astra's "wow
factor"--its modern design and edgy culinary creations.</TE>
<TE>   He brought over chef Dan Shannon to explain the edge.</TE>
<TE>   Customizing is key, Shannon said: hors d'oeuvres for a younger
group, foie gras for an older party. But no matter the demographic,
there are still a few unassailable culinary rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Cream and butter is over," he assured us. With emphasis: "All
over the country."</TE>
<TE>   On the dance floor inside the see-through plastic tent, behind
Plavoukos and Shannon, a man in black swayed to the music while his
blond dance partner ran her fingers through her hair.</TE>
<TE>   "Beverly Hills 90210" star Ian Ziering arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "Great space," he said, slowing down just a little on his way
through. "Great people. Great flow. Potential for lots of fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leaving, and Not Leaving, the South</TE>
<TE>   Novelist Richard Ford sat carefully poised on the small stage with
L.A. Weekly critic F.X. Feeney, his interviewer, who had settled on a
topic familiar to Ford: the South.</TE>
<TE>   "Southerners tell a story in a sort of explanatory way," said Ford
with characteristic deadpan, prompting audience chuckles. "But I've
never found that particularly satisfying."</TE>
<TE>   A small crowd had gathered Tuesday night at the UCLA Hammer Museum
to watch the interview, a promotion for Ford's new collection of
short stories "A Multitude of Sins" (Knopf, 2002).</TE>
<TE>   The 58-year-old writer grew up in Eudora Welty's Mississippi
neighborhood, but has spent most of his career working hard to avoid
being categorized as a Southern writer. While Ford maintains a home
in New Orleans, his stories are set elsewhere, including New Jersey,
Paris, Chicago, and Montana. After his first novel, he "left" the
South, because, Ford said, that territory had been thoroughly mined
by the writers before him. In the South, "you couldn't pick up a leaf
without there being a story under it," Ford said. "Everything was a
provocation to write about something else."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Feeney took questions from the audience. When one man
questioned Ford's lack of grammatical correctness in his new book
(one story features a series of sentences that end in propositions),
the Pultizer Prize-winning novelist answered: "I'm the novelist, the
keeper of the language.... My nature as a writer is to violate these
rules."</TE>

<LD>THE NATURAL</LD>
<LD>   The Misunderstood Presidency</LD>
<LD>   of Bill Clinton</LD>
<TE>   By Joe Klein</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday</TE>
<TE>   232 pages, $22.95</TE>
<TE>   Journalist and author Joe Klein has for years followed the
scandals and triumphs of former president Bill Clinton. In 1996 Klein
even published a novel, "Primary Colors," loosely based on the
Clinton administration, and hid behind the alias Anonymous. The book
attracted a good deal of attention not just for the salacious insider
knowledge that readers thought it provided--never mind that it was a
work of fiction--but also because the book's author, initially
unnamed, turned out to be Klein, a fact to which he did not readily
confess.</TE>
<TE>   In his latest book, Klein has chosen to cover the Clinton
administration in a more direct manner. "The Natural: The
Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton" is a brilliant assessment
of Clinton's two terms by Clinton, his White House associates and
the author, who expresses, as many people do, profound admiration and
profound disappointment in the first Democrat reelected to a second
term since FDR.</TE>
<TE>   Klein and Clinton met while the latter was still the governor of
Arkansas. The two men were born in the same year, 1946, and were part
of the same moderate "ideological jungle," Klein writes, known as the
New Democrats. In the course of covering Clinton's presidency, he
came to view it as "tumultuous, sloppy, often brilliant,
exhausting--and elusive." Although the author considers Clinton the
most gifted politician of his generation, he also views him as the
most malleable. (Astonishingly, Clinton's administration spent more
money on polling, Klein says, than all of the previous
administrations combined.)</TE>
<TE>   The author wisely chooses neither to declare Clinton a demon nor
proclaim him a saint. He was both, and perhaps the most complex
president this country has ever had. He was stubborn, gregarious and
needy; he had a "shocking" temper, an amazing intellect and a genuine
love of his country. He had a frustrating inability to make up his
mind. He adored flattery and hated delivering bad news. Clinton was
also "a creature of his own audience, besotted with his ability to
charm, constantly trying to please," Klein writes, and his "self
involvement, self-indulgence, and, all too often, self-pity, were
notorious."</TE>
<TE>   Although Klein clearly admires Clinton's many gifts, he is not
afraid to state the harsh realities of his many failures, including
attempting universal health care and failing to have a cohesive
foreign policy in international trouble spots. Klein notes that as
Clinton prepared to give his 1998 State of the Union speech--which
his staff spent days examining for potential Lewinsky-esque
double-entendres--the president could not point to a single great
accomplishment of his administration, only minor ones.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps this was because of the many scandals that he and his wife
weathered--including Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, Whitewater and
Travelgate--or because Clinton seems to have led his administration
like a college dormitory. It's hilarious and shocking to read about
the endless, exhausting meetings that went nowhere; the frequent
all-nighters; the Diet Coke and smelly pizza boxes scattered
throughout the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The president's first six months in office, Klein says, were
characterized by "mayhem" and "disorder" and considered by many to be
"the worst in modern history." Whatever victories Clinton ultimately
had, and he did have some, were in "dribs and drabs," writes Klein,
while "his defeats had been far more memorable." Yet the failures
were not entirely Clinton's fault; Klein points out that a general
loss of civility in Washington's political culture was caused by the
rise of Newt Gingrich, which led to excessive bipartisan squabbling.
Yet the president often fought hard to push through legislation he
believed in, and sometimes his determination paid off.</TE>
<TE>   As for "the great abiding mystery" of the Clintons' marriage,
here, too, Klein is insightful and thorough. Rather than offer juicy
gossip as fact, Klein concludes that Clinton probably did worship his
wife, and their union probably was strongest when Bill was in crisis
and needed to lean on Hillary. Klein also believes there was real
affection and chemistry between them, because he inadvertently
witnessed some of those moments in covering them as a reporter.
Partners, lovers, best friends and occasional adversaries all seem to
describe the roles they have played with each other. In other words,
the Clinton marriage is every bit as complicated as the president
(and no doubt Hillary) seems to be.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Klein is less disturbed by Clinton's personal scandals
than by his inability to foresee the events of Sept. 11, 2001. He
asserts that after the first World Trade Center attack in 1993, the
president should have been far more forceful in addressing the
terrorism threat. Instead, Clinton authorized occasional, minor
strikes against terrorists such as Osama bin Laden, including one
that seemed timed to deflect attention from the Lewinsky scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In Bill Clinton, the public was comforted by having a president
who seemed to know more than we did (unlike the sense that some
people have of our current president), and someone who fought to
vastly improve the lives of poor Americans. In this he succeeded. Yet
his behavior during the Lewinsky scandal, and the manic 177 pardons
he granted his last night in office, make him a figure as pathetic as
he is impressive. In the end, he managed to alienate even some of his
closest friends.</TE>
<TE>   It's reasonable for anyone to question reading still another book
about the Clintons. Yet no other book published on the subject thus
far offers such smart analysis, judicious reporting or accomplished
prose. Klein's account of the presidency is remarkably balanced and
intelligent. What kind of president was Bill Clinton? A very good
one. And sometimes a very bad one.</TE>

<HD>Wear and Hair</HD>
<DH>Jewelry, belt buckles and all things hair are celebrated at
the salon Ohio.</DH>

<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ruby, the Afro-puff mannequin, sits in the front window underneath a
1940s perm machine that makes her look more tortured than beautiful.
Above her is the torso of another mannequin, wrapped in necklaces,
and the pelvis of another decorated in belts, both serving as lamps.
Surrounding her are vintage hipster clothes, spectacular stones in a
jewelry display and a line of jeweled belt buckles that Hollywood is
hot for.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond Ruby's world, lining the walls of the next room--a beauty
salon--are dozens of photographs, movie posters and album covers
celebrating all things hair. There are hair dryers from throughout
the 20th century, as well as plenty of classic beauty products:
remember Lustre Creme, Aqua Net and Sun-In? What about the first Toni
home perm and a brand of brushes called Prophylactic?</LD>
<LD>   It's a funky mix of unique jewelry designs and a kitschy homage to
hair, put together by Jeff Hafler, a well-known Westside stylist, and
his partner, Mikal Winn. Hafler's hair collectibles--about 1,000
pieces he's found at yard sales, flea markets, thrift shops, antique
stores and on the Web--are all on display at Ohio, the nearly
year-old West Hollywood salon and storefront the two co-own on Santa
Monica Boulevard. The slogan of the shop, which was named after their
home state, is "Custom Wear and Hair."</LD>
<TE>   "People are always surprised at what this place is because you
don't know from reading the sign," says Winn, 31. "Oh, my gosh, it's
so colorful in here. It's an upscale Ohio flea market, the Hollywood
version of an Ohio flea market."</TE>
<TE>   Winn's one-of-a-kind jewelry and belt buckles are hot sellers
around the nation and in Japan, and are becoming the rage in
Hollywood. His tin, copper, steel and silver creations are on display
at the front of the store with a collection of vintage clothing that,
lately, has been attracting costumers from big movie studios. Winn's
imagination, so far, has remained hairless, but he could easily be
inspired to follow the salon's tress motif if a client really wanted
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see maybe a consignment piece where I would put a piece
of a child's hair underneath a glass in a belt buckle for a parent,"
Winn said. "That's something that's very easy to do. For the moment,
I'm just concentrating on my jewelry. But hair is our business, so
the more hair the better."</TE>
<TE>   Hafler, who previously styled hair at Rudy's and the Standard,
says he can re-create any hairstyle of the 20th century. He's been
amassing his hair collection since 1991, when a friend in beauty
school gave him his first antique hair dryer as a gift. A year and 20
pieces later, Hafler began dreaming of displaying his treasures in a
"down-home beauty parlor" in the style of "Steel Magnolias'"movie-set
salon Truvy's. His collection now includes a rusty kerosene curling
iron from 1889, a 1940s styling gun called Pin Whiz that was used to
shoot bobby pins into pin curls, and the 1960s' "C Bak" viewer, a
pair of eyeglasses attached to a mirror that women used to style the
backs of their beehives. For laughs, there is an Eva Gabor wig and
hair spray.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always liked history," said Hafler, 29. "So I turned my love
of history into this collection. The pieces were an interesting
conversation piece. Once I had 20 or 30, I got serious about opening
a beauty parlor museum. I wanted it to be a place where you could
come in and have a good time while you're getting styled and
pampered. Everywhere you look, there's something to see."</TE>
<TE>   Winn, for one, is glad Hafler's relics now have a home. There was
a time when all of Hafler's memorabilia filled their two-bedroom
house, his two 1950s perm machines flanking the bed.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff had always talked about having his own salon, and I needed
an outlet for my stuff," he said. "Everything in here was in our
house. It was a little overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   But Winn should not be one to talk. He has a collection of his
own, stored in a special place. Ohio's restroom walls are covered in
Sinead O'Connor photographs and clippings. He calls it the Sinead
museum he never has time to complete, and he hopes the singer will
someday stop in and autograph the toilet.</TE>
<TE>   "She's gorgeous. I like what she stands for," he said. "I think
it's cute. The bathroom is where you come and relax and have some
time to look around. It's like she's watching you. This is the only
thing in this place that's just mine."</TE>
<TE>   Hafler, who says he's become easy to shop for "because people
always bring me hair stuff and I just love it," has decorated and
furnished the beauty parlor entirely in collectibles. A manicurist
table dates to the 1930s. The shampoo chairs are from the 1940s, and
the green styling chairs are from the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   In the toy section and library, where Hafler's customers are
shampooed, Hafler has cosmetology textbooks for each decade of the
20th century and dolls and toys, including Farrah's Glamour Center
and Growing Hair Cher, his favorite. There's even a Modern Hair Ken
from 1972, the year Hafler was born. His collection of vintage hair
sprays, shampoos and hair tonics are fittingly displayed beneath
posters for the movies "Hair Spray," "Shampoo" and "Hair."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best place. It's fun. It's different. You always
notice something you didn't see before," said Michael Hunter, one of
Hafler's clients.</TE>
<TE>   Hafler and Winn went after their dream last year after Winn's
cousin, Rick Fisher, offered to finance the eclectic business. Winn's
jewelry and buckles had been housed in a sterile showroom, and Winn
liked the idea of displaying his creations amid his partner's
voluminous hair collection.</TE>
<TE>   "It compliments the jewelry because the jewelry that I make is not
shiny," Winn said. "It's rough and raw. This is not a Hollywood
version of a boutique at all. It's not polished and perfect. The
jewelry goes well with all the vintage stuff we have in here."</TE>
<TE>   A men's store manager in Ohio before moving to Los Angeles two
years ago, Winn still has trouble believing what's transpired with
his designing hobby since the salon opened. Winn learned to craft
jewelry 10 years ago on a lark. Five years later, when he did not
have enough money to buy a present for his boss, he incorporated his
jewelry designs into a belt buckle and gave that as his gift. Soon
all of his friends wanted to buy the belt buckles, and Winn started
wondering if there was more to his talent.</TE>
<TE>   Then he moved to Los Angeles and set up a showroom downtown.
Hollywood soon discovered his work. Lucy Liu wore one of his belt
buckles on "Saturday Night Live." Halle Berry sported one in Elle
magazine. Patricia Arquette, Britney Spears and Anne Heche have all
been photographed wearing them. Now, they're selling at 30 boutiques
around the nation, including Barneys L.A., Curves and Madison
locally."I was attracted to the opulence of the stones and the
beautiful craftsmanship of his work," said Winn's representative,
Gisela Marin, of the Nyali Showroom on Beverly Boulevard, who first
spotted Winn's belt buckle on a woman in Las Vegas. "My eye just went
directly to his belt buckle. It's like an art piece."</TE>
<TE>   Art is what Hafler and Winn, friends for eight years, are mostly
about. When Winn takes time off from his work, he likes to paint.
Hafler, who frequently intersperses his conversations with random
hair facts, practices new styles on drag queens. The bigger the hair,
the better for Hafler.</TE>
<TE>   "Hair was never bigger than in the 17th century," he said. "That
Marie Antoinette era. People would do their hair once a month, and
part of it was horse's hair that was glued back with lard. It
attracted rats and maggots that grew in their heads. This is just an
interesting hair fact that I carry with me. I love big hair."</TE>
<TE>   When his hair grows out, Hafler likes styling it in a pompadour.
"I just like the drama of big hair," he said. "It's like creating a
bit of art."</TE>

<LD>Owl Pellets</LD>
<LD>   Did you know that you can learn a lot about your environment from
owls? Well, you can--from something called an "owl pellet." Have you
ever found an owl pellet while you were hiking or playing near trees?
If not, you are probably wondering just what is an owl pellet.</LD>
<LD>   Owls are active at night. They spend their time catching and
eating other animals such as mice, prairie voles, small birds and
sometimes rabbits, skunks and flying squirrels. They usually swallow
their smaller prey whole, in a single gulp. But, they can't digest
feathers, fur or bones. So the owl's digestive track forms these
parts into neat oval pellets. Several hours after a meal, the owl
will regurgitate the pellets from their roosts.</LD>
<TE>   Most owl pellets you find will be gray, tightly packed and dry.
The size and color of the pellets offer clues as to the species of
owl. Great horned owls, the largest owls in North America, produce
hefty gray-black pellets that can be 4 inches long and 11/2 inches
thick. Other owls, such as long-eared owls, eject smaller, lighter
colored pellets half the size of the great horned owls' pellets.</TE>
<TE>   If you carefully open up and examine an owl pellet, you will find
small bones of the owl's prey--feet, front and hind legs, ribs,
vertebrae, jawbones and sometimes even whole intact skulls. By
looking closely at the skull, the pattern of the teeth and other
bones, you can often determine what the owl ate. Most libraries have
books with pictures of bird and rodent skulls and bones that can help
you identify the prey.</TE>
<TE>   Like a miniature map of a habitat, an owl pellet can tell you the
type of owl, about the food chain, about animal structure and
skeletal anatomy. And since the owl's food has to eat too, you can
also learn about the plant community.</TE>
<TE>   Learn more about owl pellets, plants, ponds and many other
environmental lessons at the Educational Environmental Fair at the
Arboretum from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday. Visit arboretum.org for
details. For general information call (626) 821-3222.</TE>

<LD>Those who spent the past week in their vacation homes on the dark
side of the moon are probably the only Americans unaware of the
controversy surrounding ABC executives' secretive attempt to lure CBS
talk show host David Letterman to their network by handing him the
11:30 p.m. time slot long occupied by journalist Ted Koppel and his
"Nightline" program.</LD>
<LD>   The response by journalists, particularly in the electronic media,
has ranged from outrage to terror. After all, by any conventional
measure "Nightline" is a success--professionally esteemed, handsomely
profitable and watched by millions each night. On many evenings, in
fact, the show's audience exceeds Letterman's.</LD>
<LD>   ABC executives roll their eyes and wonder why anyone would object
to their doing anything legal to sign Letterman, who earns huge
profits and attracts the impressionable younger viewers whose
impulsively disposed-of incomes high-rolling advertisers covet.</LD>
<TE>   Why the disconnect?</TE>
<TE>   One key to understanding can be found in the financial press,
where stories routinely refer to the networks as "Viacom's CBS" and
"Disney's ABC." When the broadcast networks were stand-alone
enterprises, their news divisions were the lovingly polished jewels
in the prestigious crown called public service, particularly at CBS.
But today both ABC and CBS are simply business units in sprawling
corporations whose "core business" is entertainment and whose
unforgiving stockholders are remorselessly focused on the bottom
line.</TE>
<TE>   The Koppel controversy is merely the most public example of a
television trend that has been accelerating for some time--the
blurring of distinctions between news and entertainment in pursuit of
profit. (Cognizant of this, such savvy professionals as Koppel, whose
new contract reduces his on-camera obligations, and his ABC colleague
Cokie Roberts have been edging toward graceful exits.) Examples of
what the future may hold for the networks already can be glimpsed in
two areas of informational broadcasting--legal affairs and
sports--where what used to be quaintly called "news values" once
prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   One of these is the Court TV cable channel, now owned by AOL-Time
Warner and Liberty Media. Court TV was once a purveyor of live trial
coverage and expert legal commentary. It also was hovering on the
brink of extinction, with a presence in just 30 million homes and an
average prime-time audience of 38,000 sets. Five years ago, Court TV
began programming reruns of syndicated cops-and-robbers shows, talk
shows and docudramas. Today the channel is a staple of basic cable
packages nationwide, with a presence in 70 million homes and a
prime-time audience of nearly 750,000 sets. The cable industry
regards it as a spectacular turnaround story.</TE>
<TE>   Disney hopes to accomplish something similar with its
"reinvention" of ESPN, whose ratings have declined by 27% over the
past five years. Along with broadcasts of sporting events and sports
news, ESPN is programming so-called reality shows, sports-themed
variety shows and even a made-for-TV movie, "A Season on the Brink,"
about college basketball coach Bobby Knight.</TE>
<TE>   To some analysts, this direction suggests not simply a diminution
of the networks' news operations but the ultimate abandonment of
serious journalism. "Some of their owners will decide that the
traditional news divisions' prestige value just can't be justified to
their stockholders," says Martin Kaplan, who directs the Norman Lear
Center at USC's Annenberg School for Communications. "The only aspect
of news they are likely to retain is covering entertainment, which is
to say themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "News, like everything else, is a profit center to them," Kaplan
says, "and it doesn't get cut any more slack than any other profit
center. If what delivers the audience is tractor pulls, then you're
going to see tractor pulls."</TE>

<TE>   Future Looks Bright for Independent Publishing</TE>
<TE>   Corporate consolidation, which is a business school euphemism for
accumulation, has been wreaking its particular form of havoc among
book publishers for some time.</TE>
<TE>   But strangely enough, when it comes to books, the market's
invisible hand has refused to bless the economy of scale. In fact, it
has given the outlets of conglomerate publishing--Random House, Simon
&amp; Schuster and HarperCollins, for example--a solid smack upside their
managerial heads. Over the past year, they all have taken a beating
on the bookstore shelves. As a consequence, they have laid off staff,
sacked editors and slashed their book lists.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, independent publishers pursuing their industry's
traditional model--with its single-minded focus on publishing and
intense author-editor relationships--are recording their best years
ever. Books by Grove/Atlantic, W.W. Norton and Public Affairs, for
example, are flying off the shelves, senior editors are earning
bonuses and profits are up, on average, more than 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Entrekin, who directs Grove/Atlantic, says his house's
devotion to traditional publishing allows him "more control over my
overhead and of my risk. I can react faster to hard times and benefit
more from my successes. Every year for the past five years we have
had at least one New York Times bestseller, and that helps us in ways
it never could one of the big guys with their huge administrative
overhead and gigantic advances. For example, 'Cold Mountain' sold 1.6
million copies in hardcover for us, and I don't think any of the big
guys ever have done that sort of business with a literary first
novel. But because our margins are better than theirs, we can also
make money selling 6,000 or 7,000 copies of a good book.</TE>
<TE>   "We have one title, 'The Bureau and the Mole,' on the bestseller
lists right now, and our profits already are up 12% over last year;
we're up about 50% for the quarter." (That title has become
controversial because its author, David A. Vise, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning Washington Post reporter, ordered 20,000 copies of his
own book from Barnesandnoble.com, then returned more than 17,000 of
them as part of a private effort to market his book. Rival publishers
alleged Vise was attempting to manipulate the bestseller lists, but
Entrekin pointed out that the book has sold more than 180,000 copies.
Also, leading bestseller lists guard against manipulation by
discounting bulk sales.)</TE>
<TE>   In Entrekin's view, the "megacorporations"--some of which were
among those grumbling about Vise's purchases--"will stagger along
because the copyrights they've collected will sustain them on some
basis for some time to come."</TE>
<TE>   But the future, he believes, belongs to independent publishers,
whose numbers are bound to increase because "the price of admission
just isn't that high anymore. All you really need is a laptop and a
convenient Kinko's."</TE>

<HD>Designers Play It Safe, Stick to Recycling Bin</HD>
<DH>Armani takes a risk and is slapped down; most others
revisit classics that are likely to sell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MILAN--Poor Giorgio Armani.</LD>
<LD>   He is one of the most successful fashion designers of all time. He
taught women how to dress in menswear and men how to dress up. But
after 27 years in business, the designer is starting to feel like a
prisoner of supple suiting.</LD>
<LD>   And so, earlier this week, for his fall collection, the designer
showed something different: Among his clothes, inspired by the first
female aviators, were (gasp) harem stirrup pants.</LD>
<TE>   The distaste in the Armani Teatro was palpable. One editor giggled
to a pal across the runway, another rolled her eyes. Reviews the next
morning in the Italian and international press were horrific. Sitting
in his minimalist chic office in the city center, his portrait
hanging on the wall near his desk, Armani was furious.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I do something that's slightly more provocative,
rather than what I'm expected to do, they focus on that. They didn't
see any of the jackets, the knitwear, the accessories. It's something
I can't easily accept," he said, tan fist pounding the blond wood of
his desk. "When Chanel puts a funny hat on the runway, nobody says
anything, but it's not expected of me. I think I have the same right.
I want the Armani style to be alive."</TE>
<TE>   He showed an exhaustive collection Monday of more than 100 looks
worn by models in leather helmets and goggles. There were some of his
classic softly tailored "greige" jackets women the world over will
continue to buy.</TE>
<TE>   With the luxury market already sagging before Sept. 11, nobody
else was much in the mood to take risks during the fall collections
this week. Mostly, designers seemed eager to get back to the business
of selling clothes, as swiftly and surely as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Today's fashion designers are in quite a pickle. To get noticed,
they have to create something new. But to stay noticed, they have to
create a bankable image, which often means sticking to what critics
and customers expect.</TE>
<TE>   When rock stars want guaranteed cash, they put out greatest hits
albums, and that's what many designers seemed to be doing. Rather
than charting new territory, they chose to play it safe, revisiting
old themes or recycling classics.</TE>
<TE>   There weren't many new trends: High boots were big, again, as well
as chunky wool scarves and sweaters in winter white. Fur or shearling
vests are still on the radar, along with belts, from the wide croc
variety to the obi.</TE>
<TE>   Some designers did dabble in alternative pant shapes--black
drainpipe trousers that bunch at the ankle at Gucci, leggings tucked
into high boots at Max Mara, khakis with contrast color cuffs at Miu
Miu and satin-trimmed velvet bloomers at Emporio Armani.</TE>
<TE>   Burberry's Chris Bailey made a case for culottes, the divided
skirts first worn by women in the 1900s for cycling, then revived and
renamed gauchos in the 1960s and 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of the ubiquitous plaid, Bailey based his collection on
the trench coats that made the company famous, playfully attaching
epaulets and buttoned flaps to wool culottes, trousers and box-pleat
skirts. On top, he stayed loyal to Brit classics, including paisley
corduroy blazers and nubby wool sweaters.</TE>
<TE>   For Miu Miu, designer Miuccia Prada was also stuck on the iconic
trench, which she made into a cropped jacket, a coat dress, a halter
top and a tote. She offered patent leather boots, shown in black,
green, yellow and red, and rain hats that would make Paddington Bear
proud.</TE>
<TE>   Prada made her name in quilted nylon, and she used the sturdy
fabric to fashion coats, zip-up jackets and pants with elastic at the
ankles in classic navy blue. She also trotted out wool short shorts
(fantasy items for sure) paired with polo shirts or anoraks and
delicious Betty Grable-esque sequined pumps with ankle straps.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the idea of hiking in high heels," the designer said of
the shoes after the show. "It's OK because the woman for fall is
strong."</TE>
<TE>   Most designers anticipated that women would want to look
self-assured in these uncertain times and that they aren't about to
open their wallets for just anything.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ford brought back the tough-talking Gucci woman of the 1990s,
when he and the house were in their  heyday. And Prada's pricey
signature line took a sexier spin through the familiar territory of
lingerie looks, sheer blouses and pretty evening skirts--all
bestsellers for her in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Cavalli didn't do much to deviate from his foxy lady luxe
formula. A body-hugging silk panther print halter gown and a pink,
bugle-bead dress that was one part flapper, one part Radio City
Rockette, are just two of many evening looks that seem destined for
the red carpet.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is Cavalli's painted denim, this season treated in
metallic animal prints, which always seems to land on lots of L.A.
lovelies. In the points between formal and everyday, however, Cavalli
was less consistent. Silk shirts and anorak jackets in trompe l'oeil
jewel prints looked trashy, as did mohair sweater dresses and
bum-hugging, colored fur suits. Too many reruns of "Dynasty" and
"Falcon Crest," perhaps?</TE>
<TE>   Donatella Versace, on the other hand, rolled out a collection with
a 1960s psychedelic bent that rocked from start to finish. She
breathed new life into her trademark coats, offering them in a
kaleidoscope of colored leather and adding embroidered silk trim to
the cuffs and hems. Flirty, fitted bodice dresses dazzled in
electrifying acid-house prints, while featherweight chiffon gowns in
body-baring silhouettes were tie-dyed in shades of turquoise, pink
and orange.</TE>
<TE>   After the show, actress Molly Shannon said it best: "It's a
woman's dream."</TE>
<TE>   And if that doesn't fatten designers' coffers, nothing will.</TE>

<LD>MILAN--Forget backstage at the shows; the place to be during fashion
week is the bar at the Hotel Principe di Savoia. (Imagine a vignette
from Robert Altman's film "Pret-a-Porter" and you get the picture.)
Alexander McQueen stopped in over the weekend for a couple of bottles
of bubbly with friends. The British designer, who works in Paris, was
in town to meet with buyers, but he had some big news for L.A. He's
planning a trip this spring to scout out locations for his first L.A.
store.</LD>
<LD>   Holding court at a round table on another night was celebrity
makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin, who had some sad news. He was diagnosed
with a brain tumor last fall. The tumor has been removed and he is
looking well. Plans are still going forward for his makeup line,
which should be in stores in a few months.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Earrings Made a Splash</TE>
<TE>   What people wear in the audience at fashion shows can be as
important as what's coming down the runway. Here, the major trend was
earrings--the bigger the better--with chandelier styles and anything
turquoise being the most popular. The handbag of choice was the Yves
Saint Laurent leather hobo with an antler for a handle, and the shoe
was Prada's buckle-toe D'Orsay pump in suede, gold brocade or animal
print. Most editors picked their shoes up in one of Milan's three
Prada stores where, as one woman put it, "It wasn't 'Do you have that
color in my size?' It was 'What do you have left in my size?'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like Father, Like Son</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Fairchild, the son of legendary fashion editor and W
magazine founder John Fairchild, is the latest fashion progeny to
venture into the business.</TE>
<TE>   After stints designing for Giorgio Armani, Calvin Klein and Ralph
Lauren, Fairchild launched his own line in Italy last year. To stand
out among the new names on the runway calendar here, the designer
created an irresistible photo op to show his clothes: an Asian-themed
party at Hotel Diana Majestic Sunday night with models clad in kimono
coats, mandarin collar shirts and low-slung menswear-inspired
trousers who lounged seductively on velvet pillows, smoking fake
opium pipes a la Marlene Dietrich in "Shanghai Express."</TE>
<TE>   Although his father coined the term "beautiful people," Fairchild
said he isn't interested in running with the jet set. "Who says I
have to be in that group?" said the 40-year-old, who lives in
Brussels with his wife, Erin, and daughters, ages 5 and 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm married, I'm into my family and I just want to make women
look beautiful and feel good without ripping them off." (Fairchild's
clothes start at $70 wholesale and are not available in the U.S.) As
for his now semi-retired papa, who was at the party: "You have to be
a madman to go into fashion," he said. "I don't miss it a bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chelsea and Donatella</TE>
<TE>   New girlfriends Chelsea Clinton and Donatella Versace had such a
blast at the designer's couture show in Paris last month that they
were back together Tuesday night. The former first daughter warmed a
front row seat at the designer's ready-to-wear show, the week's
finale. With her sleek new hairstyle and kohl eye makeup still
intact, Clinton looked splendissima in black pants, a white trench
coat and stilettos with lace-up corset detailing on the toes--all
Versace, of course. This time, boyfriend Ian Klaus, a 22-year-old
Rhodes scholar at Oxford, was on her arm.</TE>
<TE>   It must be love, because Clinton kept her hand on his knee
throughout the entire parade of sexy psychedelia.</TE>
<TE>   Between the filmy gowns and busty tops, was there anything Klaus
saw for his gal?</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," he said. "She looks good in just about anything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Italian Style</TE>
<TE>   Tod's founder Diego della Valle was so inspired by his trip to
L.A. last March, he decided to bring a little Hollywood glamour to
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   For his Sunday night bash at a warehouse, he tapped Italian
production designer Dante Ferretti (who has designed films for
Federico Fellini, Martin Scorsese and others) to re-create sets from
six classic films, incorporating Tod's products.</TE>
<TE>   In the store windows from "Breakfast at Tiffany's," Ferretti
showcased evening bags from a collection designed for this year's
Academy Awards. In the center of the dance floor where John Travolta
and Uma Thurman did their famous dance in "Pulp Fiction," he put a
pair of sleek black boots.</TE>
<TE>   Della Valle also brought in a few of his artisans to demonstrate
how Tod's handbags and shoes are handmade. "This is just like my
factory," he beamed.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened to all those croc mocs churned out that night? A
company rep said, "They are just for show."</TE>

<HD>That Age-Old Dilemma: How to Look Hip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I've always heard the saying that if you wore it
the first time around, you're too old to wear it the second time
around. That presents a problem for me. I'm a 47-year-old woman in
the entertainment world, where people are all trendoids. I'm 5 feet
4, 113 pounds, and people say I look like I'm in my early 30s. I need
to retain my credibility as a creative force in an industry dominated
by young hipsters. I don't want to dress in a stuffy, conservative
way, but neither do I want to look foolish, as in, "Can someone tell
that old broad she can't wear tie-dyed miniskirts?" What are your
suggestions on looking fashionably hip but not teeny-bopper trendy?</LD>
<LD>   --DON'T CALL ME MA'AM</LD>
<LD>   Dear Don't: Yours is a dilemma shared by countless women. You want
to look stylish, but you can't quite see yourself in a tube top,
low-rise jeans and stiletto heels. In your case the stakes are even
higher, since your clothes need to reflect your familiarity with pop
culture, which these days is practically synonymous with youth
culture. And, as you said, you still need to maintain the dignity and
respect for which you spent all those years scratching and clawing
your way to the top.</LD>
<TE>   But you don't want to look like Britney Spears on the fast track
through the time machine. What we caution against is choosing an
outfit that looks like you bought it off a 16-year-old. Stay away
from anything too short, too plunging, too see-through and too tight.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, incorporate a few pieces that reflect current trends that
don't look silly and still allow your personal style to come through.
Luckily a few companies are producing hip clothes suitable for older
women that don't scream "Desperately Trying to Recapture Lost Youth."</TE>
<TE>   Remember that jackets convey a sense of authority, but you don't
have to go for the traditional stodgy one-button blazer. Choose a
cropped style with embroidery, a mid-thigh-length unstructured one in
stretch microfiber or one of the new patchwork looks.</TE>
<TE>   You can also freshen your clothing repertoire with the new look in
shoes--feminine mini-heels with pointed toes, in slingbacks and
pumps. They work well with pants and skirts. Handbags for spring are
colorful and shaped into interesting geometric forms.</TE>
<TE>   If you're a packrat who's stashed away some of those peasant
blouses and patchwork suede jackets from the '60s and '70s, haul them
out. But update them with current pieces, like bias-cut skirts or
wide-leg pants.</TE>
<TE>   Searching for pieces for your work wardrobe, we saw many great
looks at Anthropologie, a retail clothing chain with a catalog and
Web site. A ruffle-edge button-front blouse trimmed in black has a
soft, feminine, sophisticated look; it would look great with wide-leg
or slim, flat-front black pants. An embroidered cardigan in mint and
berry has those popular three-quarter sleeves and could top a long
berry chiffon skirt. The "Kiku" skirt features a bold Asian design on
a past-the-knee lined cotton voile circle skirt and could be topped
with a short mandarin collar jacket. Anthropologie is online at
www.anthro pologie.com, or call (800) 309-2500.</TE>
<TE>   Garnet Hill's current catalog includes drawstring striped linen
pants and ones with an embroidered hem that could be worn with a
linen blouse or jacket. And Nordstrom has a plush washable suede wrap
shirt that would work with jeans or dressier pants or skirts. They're
at www.garnethill .com, (800) 622-6216, and www .nordstrom.com, (800)
285-5800.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: You recently stated in one of your columns
that pantyhose/nylons were "out." That's fine, but what are we older
readers with less-than-perfect legs supposed to do? My legs have some
unsightly age spots and sun-related bumps. I've tried to use
self-tanners, but they only accentuate what I'm trying to hide. Is
there any leg makeup that you are aware of that can be used to make
my legs look better when wearing skirts or dresses? It would have to
be something nonstaining that wouldn't get on my clothes. Any
suggestions?</TE>
<TE>   --UNDER COVER</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Under: Au contraire, we never issued a universal ban on
pantyhose! We realize that there are outfits and situations where
pantyhose are necessary. Skirts and dresses with pantyhose are fine.
We don't, however, approve of them with sandals or shorts.</TE>
<TE>   If you do want to use a leg cover-up, Dermablend makes a Leg and
Body Cover Creme that covers spots, scars and varicose veins. We've
never road tested it ourselves, but several readers have praised the
performance of this company's products. You can order online on the
Web site, www.dermablend.com, or call (877) 900-6700.</TE>

<HD>13 Items? Don't Even Think About It</HD>
<DH>If lane rage is to be averted, supermarkets' express
checkout needs some fine-tuning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM SHEA</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xpress Lane checkout rage. It was just a matter of time. Truth is,
more and more people have been pushing the 12-items-or-less envelope.
Someone was bound to blow, and someone finally did.</LD>
<LD>   After getting stuck behind an Xpress Lane cheat (13 items), a
woman up in Massachusetts wigged out and opened a king-size can of
whup on the perp.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously this was an appalling incident and certainly something
that should never, ever be condoned in a civilized society. I mean,
the checkout lane was clearly marked 12 items or less.</LD>
<TE>   Compounding the situation were the actions of the local police,
who actually arrested the woman who committed the assault while
letting the limit violator off without so much as a warning.</TE>
<TE>   Although the police certainly should be held accountable for this
particular travesty of justice, overall blame has to rest with
supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   For years now, they have been avoiding responsibility for setting
or enforcing Xpress Lane policy.</TE>
<TE>   Consider, for example, the word "item." Exactly what constitutes
an item? Is a bunch of bananas one item or many? If loose cans of
beer are counted individually, why is a six-pack a single item?</TE>
<TE>   And what of people who eat and drink in line--should what they
have in their hand or mouth count against their total?</TE>
<TE>   Also in need of reconsideration is the concept of Xpress-osity.</TE>
<TE>   Does it really matter how many items a shopper is buying if that
individual is going to pay for the purchase by check, argue over
coupons or endlessly search the bottom of a suitcase-size purse for
the three sticky, crud-covered pennies that will satisfy her neurotic
need to provide exact change? (Sorry, I was starting to go off there
myself.)</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of reforming Xpress Lane rules and regulations
before anyone else gets a booty kicked, here are my suggestions:</TE>
<TE>   * Bundled items count as one, as long as they were bundled by the
manufacturer or nature.</TE>
<TE>   * Cash only; no coupons, checks or charge cards.</TE>
<TE>   * The use of pennies, nickels, dimes or quarters, in conjunction
with paper money, is strictly prohibited. Leave the change-making to
the professionals.</TE>
<TE>   * No arguing with the cashier over your receipt. She is the law.</TE>
<TE>   * All disputes will be adjudicated on the spot by a duly deputized
shopper. A duly deputized shopper shall be defined as the person
directly behind the individual doing the arguing.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, remember: No one benefits when an act of Xpress Lane rage
occurs--except for maybe the other people who were waiting in line.</TE>

<LD>"Anybody can be an inventor. It has absolutely nothing to do with how
much education or how many degrees you have after your name. It's a
mind-set," says Patsy Sherman, who with partner Sam Smith invented
the fabric protector Scotchgard. "When an inventor sees something
unusual or something that is a disappointing result, they don't just
throw it out and start over. They say, 'Hey, what happened here? Why
did it happen? What does it mean? What might it be good for?'"</LD>
<LD>   And that's just what she and Smith did. It was in the early 1950s
while working at the 3M Co. They were trying to create a latex or
rubber material for the fuel lines of the then-new jet engines that
would not be disintegrated by the fuels required by these engines.
Accidentally, some of the material spilled onto the tennis shoe of
one of the technicians. When it dried, Sherman and others tried to
remove it with soapy water and organic solvents. Nothing would even
wet the spill. "No one had ever thought of a fabric that could repel
both oil and water. And the spot was cleaner than the rest of the
shoe. We thought, 'Forget those aircraft hoses! Maybe there's
something bigger here.'" She and Smith went on to create the fabric
protector that became used worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   Though Sherman was initially hired at 3M on a temporary basis, her
discovery extended her job for the next 40 years until she retired in
1992. "The important thing to remember," she said, "is that many of
the world's greatest discoveries like penicillin and the
vulcanization of rubber came about strictly by accident, but somebody
was keeping their eyes open and their brain in gear. I tell girls:
We've got a secret weapon called women's intuition. It's surprising
how often it works out." In 2001, Sherman was the sixth woman
inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.</TE>

<LD>Federal regulators halted a review of satellite television company
EchoStar Communications Corp.'s proposed $26-billion merger with
Hughes Electronics until EchoStar provides more data.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar, which offers Dish Network, and Hughes, the parent of
DirecTV and a unit of General Motors Corp., are seeking government
approval for a merger that would create the largest pay-TV service in
the country.</LD>
<LD>   Some data requested were filed Wednesday with the Federal
Communications Commission, but some critical information was not,
said an FCC official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   EchoStar representatives could not be reached for comment on the
news, which came after the markets closed. Hughes officials refused
to comment.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar shares fell $1.27 to close at $26.14 on Nasdaq, but
gained 14 cents in extended trading. General Motors H fell 80 cents
to $15.10 on the New York Stock Exchange and was little changed in
after-hours trading.</TE>

<LD>Film, television and commercial production on the streets of Los
Angeles County declined 29% in February compared with the same month
a year ago, according to the Entertainment Industry Development Corp.
The EIDC tracks permits issued for shooting on location--not
production on studio lots or in sound stages, which do not require
permits.</LD>
<LD>   During the first half of 2001, studios and networks ramped up
production to build a backlog of movies and scripts because of
threatened strikes by writers and actors. After more than six months
of a production drought there are some signs of an uptick.</LD>
<LD>   The 408 days spent shooting feature films in February represents a
59% increase over the 256 days film crews worked in January.
Meanwhile, production of commercials rose 11% in February to 625
days, up from January's 562 days of production. Television shooting
dipped 8% to 977 days in February, down from 1,062 days in January.
Music-video production filled 89 days in February, down from
January's 106 days of production.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Universal Studios will close its new media division next month as the
studio combines operations with USA Networks Inc.'s entertainment
group, according to sources. The shutdown affects about 30 employees,
who were notified of the plan last week and will be given
opportunities to apply for other positions in the company.</LD>
<LD>   The new-media division, which operates the UniversalStudios.com
Web site and at one point coordinated Universal's online shopping
activities, will be absorbed into USA as part of a broader effort to
eliminate overlapping functions between the two companies. Universal
and Studio Canal also are folding their specialty film divisions into
USA Films, eliminating about two dozen jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Universal Studios parent Vivendi Universal fell 92 cents
to $42 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pop star Mariah Carey, who last year saw her latest album rack up the
weakest sales of her career after signing an estimated $80-million
record deal, once again is the target of a fierce bidding war among
several major record labels.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives for Carey and the labels declined to comment. But
sources said the singer had received interest from such companies as
Island Def Jam and Elektra. Sources said the singer could command
advances amounting to a fraction of the $20 million per-album fee
guaranteed under her former contract with EMI Group's Virgin Records
division.</LD>
<LD>   EMI dropped Carey in January following the disastrous sales of her
first album under that deal, the soundtrack for the film "Glitter."
The album has sold 521,000 copies, according to SoundScan data. EMI
paid $28 million to buy the singer out of the remainder of the
contract.</LD>

<LD>Chip maker Intel Corp. tightened the range of its first-quarter sales

communications chip business is weak. The Santa Clara, Calif.,
company said it expects revenue to be $6.6 billion to $6.9

$7billion for the period. Analysts are expecting sales of $6.77
billion for the first quarter, according to a survey by Thomson

<LD>The European Union launched its formal case against the United States
over President Bush's steel tariffs and signaled it had its eye on
compensation or retaliation by blocking U.S. goods.</LD>
<LD>   The EU accused the U.S. of violating World Trade Organization
agreements and basic rules by imposing the tariffs, which take effect
March 20. The EU action followed similar moves by Japan, Australia
and New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   Under the WTO's dispute settlement procedure, the EU would have to
wait for the outcome of hearings and rulings that would take at least
18 months.</LD>
<TE>   But through separate consultations under the WTO's Safeguards
Agreement, some trade analysts and lawyers say, it could slap
sanctions on U.S. imports by the middle of the year.</TE>

assume $510 million in debt in the pipeline sale.</LD>

<HD>Mexico Says Coke Violated Antitrust Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico's antitrust commission has found Coca-Cola Co. and 89 of its
bottlers guilty of trying to shut key competitors out of Mexico's
soft drink market.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Competition Commission said Coke has been violating
the country's competition laws by enticing thousands of small stores
to sign exclusivity contracts in exchange for free refrigerators,
Coke signs and other company merchandise.</LD>
<LD>   The commission ordered the Atlanta-based company to stop offering
exclusivity contracts and barred it from continuing some its
marketing practices in Mexico, its largest market outside the United
States. Regulators stopped short of fining the company.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Coke said the company would take time to review
the ruling, which came in response to complaints submitted more than
two years ago by its chief competitor, PepsiCo Inc., and a pair of
Mexican soft drink manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Coke controls more than 70% of Mexico's soft drink market, even
though Pepsi also offers small stores similar exclusivity deals.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Japan's hobbled economy sank deeper into recession, shrinking 1.2%
during the three months ending in December, the third consecutive
quarter of contraction, the government said.</LD>
<LD>   Last quarter, which ended in September, Japan slid into its third
recession in a decade--sinking 0.5% or an annual rate of 2.1%.
Recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of
contraction.</LD>
<LD>   The contraction for the latest quarter translates to an annual
4.5% contraction. It also marks the first time the Japanese economy
has contracted for three consecutive quarters since 1993.</LD>
<TE>   A 12% drop in private sector investment dragged down overall
growth. The plunge in investment outweighed a 1.9% increase in
consumer spending and a 2% rise in household consumption.</TE>

<HD>New Group of Union Leaders Ready</HD>
<DH>Labor: First UCLA series gives 26 immigrant workers a
chance to be better organizers. More sessions are on the way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The UCLA Labor Center today graduates its first class of trained
union leaders--26 low-wage immigrant workers who have spent the last
week studying labor history and learning to be better organizers and
strategists.</LD>
<LD>   "It was perfect," said Oscar de Paz, 21, who works the graveyard
shift at a Los Angeles optical warehouse. A member of the garment
workers' union, UNITE, de Paz said he could have used some of the
strategies during recent contract talks with his employer. "I'll be
smarter next time," he said.</LD>
<LD>   The seminar for Spanish-speaking union members was the first in a
"union leadership" series planned at the center. The series, funded
by the state through the Institute for Labor and Employment, was
created in the summer of 2000. In coming months, trainings will be
run for African Americans, Asian Americans, gays and lesbians, and
women union members, said center Director Kent Wong.</LD>
<TE>   "Thanks to these expanded resources, we can reach out to certain
growing populations with a comprehensive program," he said. "We see
this as just a first step. These people will go back and serve as
teachers within their communities."</TE>
<TE>   This first training drew rank-and-file members from unions
representing janitors, hotel housekeepers, nursing home workers,
construction laborers and security workers.</TE>
<TE>   Expenses for the seminar, and a week's lodging and meals, were
covered by the center, while wages were paid by the various unions
who sent members.</TE>
<TE>   None of the participants had been on the UCLA campus before. "With
the kind of work we do, we could never afford something like this,"
said de Paz, who earns $8 an hour driving a forklift and loading
boxes from midnight to 8 a.m. A native of Guatemala, de Paz came to
the United States to join his parents seven years ago. After taking
the warehouse job a year ago, he became active in his union local and
started helping co-workers deal with managers at work. Like other
participants, he was identified by union staffers as a potential
leader.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Arrellano, who supervised the training for the center,
said participants were surprised to learn that the current wave of
immigrant organizing is not unique. "They saw this as one of many
waves, that immigrant worker involvement is not something that just
happened in the last 10 years," she said. "That really resonated.
People were extremely inspired by it."</TE>
<TE>   One day of the training was devoted to health and safety issues,
such as repetitive stress injuries, and how they can be used to
galvanize workers. In one exercise, participants identified physical
stresses on their own jobs--such as pushing a vacuum cleaner in the
same direction thousands of times per shift--and illustrated them
with bright "ouch" stickers.</TE>
<TE>   "One highlight for me was when we asked them to identify their
visions for the future," Arrellano said. "They took a really broad
look. It wasn't just about wages and benefits, but what kinds of
communities we want to build."</TE>
<TE>   The 26 will attend a small graduation ceremony at the school
today, to be immediately followed by--what else?--a trip to a protest

<HD>PG&amp;E Files a Revised Version of Its Bankruptcy Recovery
Plan</HD>
<DH>Energy: One of the only changes utility makes is keeping a
pristine land parcel under its ownership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN GAUDETTE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. on Thursday filed a revised version of its
plan to emerge from bankruptcy, a month after a federal bankruptcy
judge rejected its first attempt.</LD>
<LD>   The judge had rejected PG&amp;E's earlier argument that the Bankruptcy
Code allows it to disregard dozens of state regulations and laws on
its path to reorganization.</LD>
<LD>   The new plan's hallmarks remain largely the same from the
utility's initial disclosure statement filed in December.
California's largest utility still hopes to transfer $8billion of
transmission lines, power plants, hydroelectric dams and other assets
into three new, federally regulated companies, ending state oversight
of many key functions.</LD>
<TE>   PG&amp;E claims this will allow it to borrow more money against those
assets, raising enough to pay the $13.2-billion debt it claimed the
day it filed for Chapter 11, plus interest.</TE>
<TE>   The state Public Utilities Commission and consumer advocates say
PG&amp;E is using bankruptcy as an excuse to duck state regulation and
charge more for the power it produces. PG&amp;E denies that and claims
its plan is the fastest and best way to become credit-worthy and
resume buying electricity.</TE>
<TE>   One key change is that 33,000 to 78,000 acres of pristine land
would remain under the utility's ownership, said Ron Low, a PG&amp;E
spokesman. Environmental groups, farmers, hikers and the federal
government worried that stewardship of the land would decline and
that access to land and the water flowing from Sierra Nevada rivers
running through that land would diminish if owned by PG&amp;E's parent
corporation.</TE>
<TE>   With this revision, PG&amp;E also hopes to convince U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Dennis Montali that breaking dozens of California laws and
regulations--including a recent law barring utilities from selling or
transferring ownership of power plants until 2006--is an economic
necessity that won't harm public safety.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E also wants to convince its thousands of creditors that its
plan will get them paid with the least delay before they see the full
version of a competing plan from the PUC, which regulates PG&amp;E.</TE>
<TE>   The state's plan calls for PG&amp;E to use cash it has on hand to pay
its debts. Both sides have called the other's plan flawed, and the
tension between regulator and regulated has grown so thick they plan
to negotiate through a professional mediator at Montali's request.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shares of PG&amp;E closed off 1 cent at $22.60 on the New York Stock
Exchange, before news of the new plan was announced.</TE>

<HD>SEC Expansion Request Gets Positive Response</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt took his case
for a bigger SEC budget to Congress on Thursday, and appeared to have
a commitment for more money from the Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt asked Congress for an additional $15 million to hire 100 more
lawyers, accountants and other professionals than President Bush
proposed in his budget for fiscal 2003, which begins Oct. 1.</LD>
<LD>   After Pitt's testimony, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management
and Budget said the OMB is "willing to work to provide the SEC with
the funding it needs to add additional full-time staff in fiscal
2003."</LD>
<TE>   Asked if OMB would fund all 100 employees requested by Pitt,
spokeswoman Amy Call said, "I'm not sure that the exact figure has
been completely worked out," adding that "we're talking along the
lines of what Chairman Pitt discussed in the hearing this morning."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's budget has emerged as a political issue in the wake of
Enron Corp.'s failure and the public outcry over illegal or
misleading corporate accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional Democrats and Republicans have urged a bigger SEC
budget to handle the Enron case and other accounting investigations.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush proposed spending $467 million for the agency in fiscal
2003, a 6.6% increase over this year and an amount that wouldn't
allow for new staff.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, who was appointed to the top SEC post by Bush last summer,
said the additional 100 staff would increase the commission's
personnel to 3,100 and represented a minimum number needed to meet
rising demands on the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of recent events, we need to restore full confidence in
our capital markets, and I believe we cannot do that without
additional personnel," Pitt said in testimony before a Senate
appropriations subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to more staff, Pitt has asked for $76 million more to
provide "pay parity" that would increase the salaries of SEC staff to
levels now paid to their counterparts in federal banking agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is one message I can leave with you today it is: Please,
please fully fund pay parity for the SEC in fiscal 2003," he told the
panel.</TE>
<TE>   The House Financial Services Committee said in a report last week
that it intends to support a 50% increase in the SEC budget in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's testimony drew bipartisan backing from the panel. "We
certainly want to support you," said Sen. Judd Gregg of New
Hampshire, the top Republican on the subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Subcommittee Chairman Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) "wholeheartedly
supports funding for pay parity as well as funding for staff
increases at the SEC," said spokesman Andy Davis.</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P Downgrades HP Bond Rating; Losses in Hardware Units
Cited</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co.'s bond rating was cut three levels by Standard &amp;
Poor's on Thursday, which said the profit outlook of the world's
second-largest computer maker would suffer with or without its
planned purchase of Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   S&amp;P, the New York credit-rating firm, said steep competition and
mounting losses at Hewlett-Packard's hardware units have eroded its
sales and earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed $21.6-billion acquisition may not lift sales and
profit enough to make up for the potential difficulty of integrating
the two firms and the disruption to HP's business.</LD>
<TE>   "HP's weaker profitability levels and diminished earnings
predictability reflect the impact of its computer hardware segments,"
S&amp;P said. "While the merger offers the scale and market positions in
hardware that could lead to greatly improved profitability, the
execution risks are significant."</TE>
<TE>   The Palo Alto-based computer maker called the downgrade
"disappointing" and said its balance sheet is strong.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares fell 18 cents to $20 in Thursday trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. They have dropped 14% since the proposed acquisition
was announced Sept. 3. Houston-based Compaq rose 17 cents to $11.15,
also on the NYSE. Its shares have fallen 10% since the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P trimmed HP's corporate credit and senior debt ratings to A-
from AA-. The new rating is the fourth-lowest of 10 investment
grades. Its commercial paper ratings were cut to A2 from A1+.</TE>
<TE>   The computer maker's 5.75% coupon notes maturing in 2006 dropped
to $988 per $1,000 face value, from $998 on Wednesday, pushing up the
yield on the debt to 6.03% from 5.79%.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P said Compaq's debt may be upgraded if the purchase goes
through because it's being bought by a stronger firm.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service lowered HP's credit ratings in September
to A2 from Aa3 because of the proposed acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   HP stockholders will vote on the purchase March 19; Compaq
investors meet the following day.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, UBS Warburg analyst Don Young said in research notes
that both companies may have used accounting to boost their
fourth-quarter earnings. HP and Compaq beat analysts' earnings
estimates in the fourth quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Young criticized Compaq for switching to a new revenue-recognition
accounting requirement in the fourth quarter of 2001 while its
competitors didn't, saying it enabled the company to inflate profit.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies denied that their accounting was improper.</TE>

<HD>Biggest Retail Gain in Nearly 2 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retailers on Thursday reported their strongest sales increases in
nearly two years in February, exceeding estimates and offering more
evidence that an economic recovery is underway.</LD>
<LD>   The strong numbers, along with low inventories of unsold goods,
will benefit retailers into the second half of the year, analysts
said.</LD>
<LD>   Though discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. continued to
shine, some department stores and specialty retailers continued to
post sluggish results.</LD>
<TE>   The better-than-expected February retail sales, along with other
positive economic data, are prompting many analysts to predict a
stronger economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "The improvement has come much faster than most of us thought,"
said Michael Niemira, an economist with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in
New York. "Most of us thought there would be a sluggish first half. I
am no longer making that case because it's clear that a lot of
economic numbers for the first two months of the year are strong, in
retail and the rest of the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Consumers in February took advantage of warmer-than-usual winter
weather throughout much of the country to do some early spring
shopping, giving a sizable boost to discount stores in particular.</TE>
<TE>   Many mall-based stores, however, were left out in the cold.
Specialty apparel stores were the only retail group to post lower
year-over-year sales for February at stores open at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, sales grew 6.2% in February, according to a Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi tally, the biggest year-over-year increase in
so-called same-store sales since April 2000. Goldman Sachs pegged the
overall retail sales gain at 5.5%.</TE>
<TE>   The country's mass merchants again led the charge, with a 10.3%
year-over-year gain for February in stores open at least a year,
according to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi index.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart sales increased 11% at its discount stores. Target Corp.
gained 10% at its namesake stores open at least a year. Same-store
sales are considered an important measure of a company's overall
health because the number excludes new and closed stores.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of specialty hard goods, especially at home improvement
stores that continue to benefit from low interest rates that are
fueling housing sales, were up 9.4%, Goldman Sachs said.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end, specialty apparel stores saw sales fall 5.7%,
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi reported.</TE>
<TE>   That category was dragged down by poor showings at Gap Inc., with
sales down 17%; Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, with a 9% decline, and even
usually strong Talbots Inc., which saw sales slide 17.7%, mostly from
a shift in the stores' winter clearance sales.</TE>
<TE>   Department store sales were essentially flat, according to Goldman
Sachs' retail index, with a 0.3% gain, boosted mainly by a 12.5%
increase at J.C. Penney Co.'s department stores and a 14.4% sales
rise at Kohl's Corp., the clothing seller that has become a Wall
Street darling with month after month of booming sales. Target
Corp.'s Mervyn's stores also posted better-than-expected sales for
February, with a same-store sales gain of 2.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the rest of the sector performed as expected, with
Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of Macy's and Bloomingdales,
down 2.8%, and May Department Stores Co. down 2.7%.</TE>

<HD>Groups Appeal Online Royalties Proposal</HD>
<DH>Broadcasting: Radio stations, Webcasters and record labels
disagree with the rates suggested by an arbitration panel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio stations, Webcasters and record labels are appealing an
arbitration panel's proposed royalties for online radio services,
arguing over rates that some say would kill most free Web broadcasts.</LD>
<LD>   At issue are fees that online radio services would have to pay to
artists and record companies for each song played. The fee is $1.40
per thousand listeners for Internet-only stations, and 70 cents per
thousand listeners for over-the-air stations that simultaneously
broadcast online.</LD>
<LD>   Webcasters said the fees would consume most if not all of their
dwindling advertising income. David Landis, founder of the Los
Angeles-based station Ultimate80s, said his royalties would be $3,000
to $4,000 a month, which would increase his expenses by about 50%.</LD>
<TE>   But the record companies' trade group, the Recording Industry
Assn. of America, says the proposed rates are too low. The rates
should be closer to the deals negotiated between the RIAA and more
than two dozen companies, RIAA attorney Steve Marks said, even though
many of those companies are no longer Webcasting or even in business.</TE>
<TE>   The Librarian of Congress is due to rule on the appeals and set
the rates by May 20.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, anyone can launch a non-interactive radio
station over the Net if they pay royalties to the copyright holders.
Those royalties go to music publishers, which collect a small
percentage of the Webcasters' revenue, and to labels and artists, who
split 50-50 the royalties set by the Library of Congress' Copyright
Office.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitration panel's job was to calculate what the rates would
be if negotiated by a willing buyer and a willing seller. But
attorneys for the Webcasters and the RIAA say the panel botched the
calculation by looking at the wrong evidence.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, both sides contend that the panel put far too much
weight on a deal the RIAA negotiated with Yahoo Inc., which mainly
retransmits over-the-air broadcasts. Ken Steinthal, an attorney
representing the Digital Media Assn., said the rates should reflect
what the music publishers collect, which is about 85% less than the
proposed royalty. But Marks said the publishers' fees aren't relevant
because the two markets are so different.</TE>
<TE>   The Webcasters also want the option of paying the labels and
artists a percentage of the revenue generated by their online
broadcasts. The RIAA initially proposed collecting 15% of the
Webcasters' revenue, but both the RIAA and the arbitrators cooled on
the idea because it's hard to define what revenue should be covered.</TE>
<TE>   Landis, who is helping to organize a protest by small independent
Webcasters, wants to pay 2% of revenue or $1,000 a year, whichever is
greater.</TE>

<LD>Faced with spiraling costs from subsidizing auto leases to consumers,
General Motors Corp. said it would reduce lease programs to save
money and boost the value of used cars that return to the market.</LD>
<LD>   Auto makers frequently promise high residual values--the money
vehicles are worth at the end of a lease--to help keep down monthly
lease payments and make deals more attractive to buyers, and to help
move slow-selling cars and trucks off dealer lots.</LD>
<LD>   But if the vehicles are worth less at the end of the lease than
the declared residual, then the auto maker or finance company holding
the loan must absorb the difference, which can be several thousand
dollars per vehicle.</LD>
<TE>   "The cost of leasing has gotten prohibitively expensive," Paul
Ballew, GM's director of market analysis, said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw that residuals are starting to fall, and we anticipated
softness in the auction market [for used cars], so we've been more
aggressive than others in pulling back from leasing. We don't want to
add hidden costs to our behavior in the market."</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers lost an estimated $10 billion in the U.S. last year
from lower-than-expected residuals, according to CNW Marketing
Research.</TE>
<TE>   That's expected to improve only somewhat this year, to a loss of
$8.5 billion, said Art Spinella, president of CNW's automotive
division.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect a reduction in subsidized leases ... so they can boost
profits and not get creamed on residual values," Spinella said.</TE>
<TE>   Leasing is a good option for drivers who like to get a new car
every two or three years and drive fewer than 15,000 miles a year.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, on a three-year lease they pay $100 a month less than
they would on a five-year purchase loan, Spinella said.</TE>
<TE>   The downside is that at the end of the lease they have no equity
in the vehicle and must replace it.</TE>
<TE>   For those who plan to keep a car five years or more, buying makes
sense because drivers own the vehicle once it's paid off, and,
presumably, the car will run for several more years.</TE>
<TE>   Leasing also allows consumers to drive a car they wouldn't
otherwise be able to afford because they're effectively renting it
for the lease period. Hence the high percentage of leases for
DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Ford Motor Co.'s Volvo
luxury cars.</TE>
<TE>   Lease rates for Volkswagen, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor
Co. are inflated by the high percentage of leases of their Audi,
Lexus and Infiniti brands. Ford and Chrysler Group say they don't
plan to de-emphasize leasing, which accounted for 26.4% and 22.7% of
their retail business last year, compared with 28.8% for GM.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no intent to disenfranchise our customers who want to
lease," said George Pipas, Ford's director of sales analysis.</TE>
<TE>   People who lease Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars and trucks tend to
be more loyal customers, Pipas said.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler Group, made up of the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands, is
"right about where we want to be" with leasing, said Marc Henretta,
Chrysler's manager of sales communications.</TE>
<TE>   Leasing has been decreasing across the board, down from a peak of
31.4% of light-vehicle sales in 1999 to 27.6% last year, according to
the National Auto Dealers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "The percentage of new-car sales going into leasing programs has
fallen in recent years as interest rates have fallen to levels not
seen since the early 1960s," said Paul Taylor, chief economist for
NADA.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been a big fan of leasing," said Jim Lynch, president
of the Rydell Automotive Group's San Fernando GM dealerships.</TE>
<TE>   "When cars are returned, they're auctioned off at lower prices
than what they would get without leasing, it costs manufacturers tons
of money, and the person who bought the car outright suffers because
it's worth less."</TE>
<TE>   Dealers, however, need leasing, because it represents a steady
stream of business by repeat customers and regularly supplies
late-model used cars that generally provide higher margins than new
cars.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of GM rose $1.49 to $61.41 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Fed Chief: Recession Over</HD>
<DH>Testimony: Greenspan, on Capitol Hill, sounds much more
upbeat than just a week ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. BERRY</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Thursday
that not only is last year's recession over but that "an economic
expansion is already well underway."</LD>
<LD>   Just eight days earlier, Greenspan had been much more cautious in
his testimony, saying only that a recovery from the slump was "just
getting underway." However, he then reiterated concerns that for a
variety of reasons the expansion could turn out to be significantly
weaker than those that have followed previous recessions.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last week, however, unexpectedly strong economic news had
convinced many economists that the economy is growing at a 4% annual
rate in the first three months of this year. That is much stronger
than forecasters had expected only a few weeks ago. Similarly, during
the period between Greenspan's appearances on Capitol Hill, the
fourth-quarter growth rate was revised upward to 1.4% annually, much
faster than the 0.2% rate first estimated.</LD>
<TE>   More good news came Thursday from the Labor Department, which said
initial claims for unemployment benefits averaged 372,750 per week
over the last four weeks, the lowest level since April 2001. That
figure is well below the peak of about 500,000 reached in the weeks
after the Sept. 11 attacks. Many analysts believe the department will
report today that the number of payroll jobs increased last month for
the first time in nearly a year.</TE>
<TE>   The department also said Thursday that productivity of private
businesses--the amount of goods and services produced for each hour
worked--rose at an extraordinarily high 5.2% annual rate in the
fourth quarter of last year. Earlier, the figure was estimated at
3.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Productivity normally declines during recessions, increasing labor
costs at a time business profits are already suffering from falling
sales. Profits declined substantially last year, partly because many
firms were unable to raise their prices due to competition and weak
markets. But the strong productivity gains could become even stronger
as the economy gathers steam and give a strong boost to profits this
year, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Greenspan continued to caution about the
ultimate strength of the recovery. That led many analysts to conclude
that when Fed policymakers meet March 19, they are likely to continue
to conclude that the possibility of further economic weakness still
outweighs the risk that inflation will get worse.</TE>
<TE>   Other recent figures have indicated that manufacturing firms,
which were among the hardest hit by last year's slump, have begun to
increase production once more. There is also evidence that business
spending on new equipment, which had been falling for a year and a
half, is beginning to rise modestly. Meanwhile, housing remains one
of the brightest parts of the economy, with low mortgage interest
rates encouraging sales and construction.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan acknowledged all this good news Thursday in his
testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen encouraging signs in recent days that underlying
trends in final demand are strengthening," the Fed chairman said.
But, he added, "the dimensions of the pickup [in consumer and
business spending] remain uncertain."</TE>
<TE>   A key concern of Greenspan and other Fed officials is whether
business investment spending will gradually accelerate this year and
provide a solid underpinning for the economic expansion. Many
executives remain gloomy, as Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. told its clients
this week, and that could limit their willingness to increase their
capital spending budgets.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, as Greenspan noted Thursday and in his testimony
before the House Financial Services Committee on Feb. 27, the
economic expansion also could be held back by the fact that housing
and the purchases of consumer durables such as automobiles did not
decline last year as they usually do during recessions. And that
means there is little, if any, pent-up demand that could trigger a
rapid rise in consumer spending this year.</TE>

<HD>Halvorson Named as Kaiser's Next CEO</HD>
<DH>HMO: President of HealthPartners will join the nation's
largest nonprofit health-care organization in May.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kaiser Permanente, California's largest health maintenance
organization and the pioneer of thrifty medical care, said Thursday
that it has chosen George C. Halvorson as its next chairman and chief
executive. Halvorson is president and CEO of HealthPartners, one of
Minnesota's largest health plans, and a recognized leader in
health-care reform.</LD>
<LD>   It's a big step up for Halvorson, 55, who will take the job in
May. He will move from an HMO with an enrollment of 700,000 to take
on the nation's largest nonprofit health-care organization with
8.3million members in nine states and the District of Columbia.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland-based Kaiser has 29 medical centers, 423 medical offices
and 90,000 employees. It has 6.3 million enrollees throughout the
state and about 3.1 million in Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Kaiser has fared well in the tumultuous health-care industry with
an operating income of $714 million on revenue of $19.7 billion for
2001. Membership grew by 122,000 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Halvorson's biggest challenge will be to deliver quality health
care amid rapidly rising costs, a task Halvorson said he was eager to
tackle.</TE>
<TE>   "There are immense opportunities [for savings] in the management
of preventive care and chronic care in California," Halvorson said.
"We can model for the world an optimal delivery system for medical
care."</TE>
<TE>   Halvorson said new technology, though expensive, is considerably
less costly than the emergency medical care it can prevent.</TE>
<TE>   In Minnesota, for example, HealthPartners incorporated a
body-weight scale for home use that, among other things, notifies
doctors electronically if a patient has a sudden increase in weight.</TE>
<TE>   Halvorson said HealthPartners managed an 80% reduction in
expensive acute care for congestive heart failure patients through
the use of such scales and better communication between doctors and
patients about steps they could take to improve their fitness.</TE>
<TE>   Halvorson blamed the health-care system for failing to communicate
with patients. "Patients get more [communication] about the needs of
their dogs than they do about managing their own blood sugar levels,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Halvorson led the formation of HealthPartners by completing the
merger of Group Health Inc. and MedCenters Health Plan in 1992.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The percentage of Californians who can afford to buy a median-priced
home slipped to 32% in January, down from 35% in the same period a
year ago, according to the California Assn. of Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   Continued gains in median prices of single-family homes in
California during most of last year--including January's whopping
17.1% increase--were responsible for the decline, said CAR President
Robert Bailey.</LD>
<LD>   Based on CAR's index, San Diego was the least affordable county in
Southern California, with only 27% of households able to afford a
median-priced home, up slightly from 25% a year earlier. Orange
County was the second-least affordable county at 31%, up 2 percentage
points.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, affordability was 34%, down from 38% a year
ago, while Ventura County remained the same at 36%. Data were
unavailable for Riverside and San Bernardino counties.</TE>
<TE>   At 16%, Santa Clara was the least affordable county in the state,
followed by San Francisco at 17%.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A national home builder bought an interest in an Anaheim Hills ranch
from a shopping center developer that has scrapped plans to build a
retail project on the site.</LD>
<LD>   D.R. Horton, an Arlington, Texas-based residential builder, paid
$15.2 million for nearly 19 acres at Maag Ranch. The sellers were
Regency Centers, a national owner, operator and developer of
grocery-anchored shopping centers, and its local partner, GME
Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   Horton plans to build 106 single-family homes on the site, said
Tom McDonough, a senior vice president at Regency Centers. A Horton
spokesman could not be reached.</LD>
<TE>   Regency Centers, a Jacksonville, Fla., developer of shopping
centers, and Irvine-based GME Anaheim had hoped to build homes and a
retail center at the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   But McDonough said a series of meetings with city officials and
local residents convinced the developers that they would not earn
community support for their project.</TE>
<TE>   "They like the bucolic nature of Anaheim Hills," he said, "and
prefer not to have retail there."</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Regency's shares closed at $29.10,
up 15 cents, while Horton finished at $42.10, down 25 cents.</TE>

<HD>SEC Sues Former Surf Apparel Execs</HD>
<DH>Courts: Regulators allege that Freedom Surf added $5.2
million in fraudulently valued assets to its books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities regulators have accused the former officers of a surfing
apparel company of falsifying 1999 financial statements.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a lawsuit that
Freedom Surf Inc.'s former president, Raece Richardson, 37, of
Huntington Beach, and vice president, David McKenzie, 42, formerly of
Huntington Beach, had added $5.2 million in fraudulently valued
assets to the company's books, apparently to attract interest from
potential investors.</LD>
<LD>   The company's former auditor, James Slayton, and a friend of
Richardson, Cameron Gorges of San Clemente, also were accused of
taking part in the scheme.</LD>
<TE>   Without admitting or denying the SEC allegations, Freedom Surf,
which is now Freestar Technologies Inc. in the Dominican Republic,
McKenzie and Gorges have settled the case, the commission said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   No fines were assessed.</TE>
<TE>   The case against Richardson, who is facing other lawsuits and
actions by the commission and state regulators, has not been settled.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing date will be scheduled before an administrative law
judge for the case against Slayton, the former auditor.</TE>
<TE>   According to a civil complaint filed Wednesday in federal court in
Washington, Richardson and McKenzie orchestrated a scheme to inflate
the company's assets with certain equipment in Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson had Gorges appraise the equipment he had not seen at
$5.2 million with figures provided by Richardson. The appraisal was
then sent to Slayton, who allegedly signed off on it without
conducting an audit.</TE>
<TE>   The company subsequently reported total assets of $5.2 million in
filings with the SEC in 2000 and reported in another SEC filing that
it had sold the equipment for $4.8 million to a company owned by
Richardson and his father. The SEC described the reported sale as a
"sham."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson founded Freedom Surf in November 1999 to produce
wetsuits and surfing apparel, the SEC said. He served as chief
executive until resigning in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   FreeStar shares closed unchanged at 10 cents in over-the-counter
trading.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. will pay $8.5million to settle a lawsuit by California
that claims the long-distance phone company used deceptive business
practices to gain customers.</LD>
<LD>   State Judge Alfred Chiantelli in San Francisco approved the
settlement Thursday, allowing the state to receive $8.5 million in
penalties and reimbursements to pay for its investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and the state's Public Utilities
Commission sued WorldCom in July 2000, accusing the company of
billing customers for additional services and switching their
long-distance providers without permission.</LD>
<TE>   "We expect this judgment will serve as an industry model and as a
wake up call to other long-distance providers," Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement calls for Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom to provide
more information about rate restrictions and directory assistance
fees in its advertising. Executives at WorldCom, the No.2
long-distance carrier after AT&amp;T Corp., weren't available to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of WorldCom, which bought MCI Communications in 1998 to
create MCI WorldCom and dropped "MCI" from its name in 2000, fell 24
cents to $8.40 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Justice Dept. Steps Up Andersen Investigation</HD>
<DH>Probe: Officials say they have been considering requesting
an indictment for the last six weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Justice Department sources said Thursday that they were focusing
increased attention on Enron Corp.'s former accounting firm,
Andersen, and its admitted practice of shredding documents in
connection with its audit of the energy company, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in December.</LD>
<LD>   Current and former Justice Department officials said that for the
last six weeks they have been contemplating presenting a grand jury
in Houston with a request for an indictment, but officials could not
say Thursday if they had taken that action.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing is happening today," said one official. "But something
could be happening tomorrow."</LD>
<TE>   Andersen representatives have discussed the firm's internal
findings of document shredding at its Houston office with the Justice
Department, other sources familiar with the investigation said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen fired the executive in charge of auditing Enron in
January, saying partner David B. Duncan organized an effort at the
Houston office to destroy thousands of documents after learning of a
Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. Duncan said he was
following the directions of an attorney at Andersen's Chicago
headquarters. Andersen said the shredding ceased Nov. 9--the day
after the firm received a subpoena from the SEC but nearly three
weeks after the agency announced an inquiry into Enron's dealings.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Guiffra, an attorney for Duncan, declined to comment.
Duncan has been cooperating with the Justice Department's probe.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra said he could not
discuss the Enron-Andersen case, including whether any enforcement
actions were pending. Andersen also would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   One senior Justice Department official who recently left the
department said an indictment of Andersen executives for destruction
of documents has been a point of serious discussion for six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been hearing that for a long time, but I have not heard that
they're on the verge of doing it," said the official, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. "When they first opened the
investigation, this was on the table."</TE>
<TE>   The former Justice official, who was involved with many of the
department's white-collar crime investigations, said an indictment of
Andersen executives could be used to speed the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Something like this would be a tool to get mid-level people at
Andersen to roll over on senior people at Andersen," the official
said. "By handing up an indictment, speedy trial kicks in--it starts
a 70-day clock from arraignment to trial. So it turns the heat up."</TE>
<TE>   The former Justice official also said that an indictment of
Andersen executives was plausible based on their own comments.</TE>
<TE>   "The destruction of material documents after you are aware that an
investigation is pending could be obstruction of justice. [Andersen
executives] admitted to shredding documents. The question is what's
in the documents that were shredded, and were the executives aware of
an investigation when they shredded them? The fact that they are
investigating Andersen is no secret. And one of the most likely
charges is obstruction."</TE>
<TE>   Delta Air Lines, the third-largest U.S. carrier, on Thursday
became the latest major company to abandon Andersen in the wake of
the Enron scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In severing a relationship that goes back five decades, Delta
joined other high-profile companies including mortgage giant Freddie
Mac, big pharmaceutical concern Merck &amp; Co. and SunTrust Banks in
dropping Andersen, though Freddie Mac will still use the firm for
consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   Just four months after Andersen's auditing practices were linked
to the collapse of Houston-based Enron, the accounting firm has lost
at least $85 million in business, according to a review by The Times
of accounting fee statistics from federal regulatory filings.</TE>
<TE>   Although that is just a tiny slice in the firm's estimated $4.5
billion in annual North American revenue, industry observers said it
represents an ominous trend for the country's fifth-largest
accounting firm, which audits about 2,400 U.S. public companies
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Commenting on the losses, Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said
the lost clients "represent a small fraction of our total revenues
and client base."</TE>
<TE>   "We are gratified that the vast majority of Andersen's clients
remain with the firm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But one measure of how bad things are going for Andersen is how
recent auditor changes are sorting out. There have been 75 changes in
auditors of public companies served by the Big 5 accounting firms
since Jan. 1, according to Auditor-Trak, a service of Atlanta-based
Strafford Publications. Andersen has been on the losing end of 35 of
those changes and has gained only one, Auditor-Trak said.</TE>
<TE>   "This suggests a disturbing trend," said Richard Ossoff of
Strafford Publications. "If in the coming weeks a significant number
of high-profile clients also abandon Andersen, the risk of
accelerating defections will be difficult to stem."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also faces the risk of individual partners or groups of
partners bolting for other firms, taking their clients with them.
Each big client defection has the potential to add to the cycle.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has attempted to stem the tide by settling some of the
larger lawsuits against the firm for its accounting work. Last week,
it agreed to pay $217 million in damages for failing to uncover fraud
involving the Baptist Foundation of Arizona, a church-based
investment fund it audited.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also has made an initial offer to settle the Enron claims
for $750 million, to be paid over a multiyear period, according to
attorneys familiar with the offer. But for such an offer to work,
Andersen must hold on to a client base large enough to generate the
profit that would go into the settlement.</TE>

<HD>Boeing Gets Big Contract From Army</HD>
<DH>Defense: The ambitious project, which could be worth up to
$10 billion, will revamp the way ground warfare is waged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. won a major contract Thursday to develop an entire network
of new weapons, communication systems and intelligence-gathering
sensors that the Pentagon hopes will one day revolutionize the way
the Army fights wars.</LD>
<LD>   In a major boost to Southern California's defense industry,
Boeing's space and communications unit, headquartered in Seal Beach,
was the surprise winner over two other leading defense firms to win
the contract, which has a potential value of at least $4 billion over
the next five years.</LD>
<LD>   Defense analysts said the overall value could top $10 billion as
elements of Future Combat Systems are deployed over the next decade.</LD>
<TE>   The Army for the first time is asking a single defense contractor
to oversee development of a range of new technologies and weapons
that would bring the service into the digital age.</TE>
<TE>   The new weapons, which could include robotic land cruisers and
high-powered microwave cannons, would be linked by complex
battlefield command and control data networks and leading-edge
intelligence-gathering sensors.</TE>
<TE>   Infantrymen, linked by satellites, also would have unprecedented
access to information about where they are, who is around them and
where the enemy might be positioned.</TE>
<TE>   "Future Combat Systems is a major step in the transformation of
the Army," said Claude M. Bolton Jr., assistant secretary of the Army
for acquisition, logistics and technology, as he announced the
contract winner.</TE>
<TE>   Because the design of the network would rely heavily on emerging
technologies, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a
Pentagon unit that funds leading-edge weapons development, is
assisting the Army with the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very excited about the opportunity to partner with [the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] and Army," said James
Albaugh, president of Boeing's space and communications business. "It
is really the first of the true transformational programs for the
Pentagon."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how many jobs the program will eventually require,
but Albaugh said several hundred engineers would be needed for the
initial development phase.</TE>
<TE>   The program is a key component of a Pentagon goal to create a
digital Army that would be "faster, lighter and smarter" than the
current force tied to the more traditional ways of fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation reflects post-Cold War realities in which U.S.
troops are expected to fight swift regional skirmishes rather than
set battles with heavy weaponry, defense analysts said. The conflict
in Afghanistan further pushed the urgency of transforming the Army,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   "It could turn out to be the biggest thing that has ever happened
to the Army and be worth a corresponding amount of money for Boeing,"
said Loren Thompson, a defense policy analyst with the Lexington
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The Army, within the next decade, wants the ability to place a
combat-ready brigade anywhere in the world within 96 hours, a full
division in 120 hours and five divisions on the ground within 30
days. Currently it can take several weeks to deploy a brigade, mainly
because of the logistics of transporting heavy vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Under the program, which could include billions of dollars more in
follow-up work, Boeing engineers in Anaheim--and some in
Seattle--will initially design and develop the system of weapons and
technologies that the Army could start deploying by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   An immediate goal would be to develop a vehicle that would weigh
dramatically less than the 70-ton M-1A1 tank, which cannot be readily
transported by air. Despite being lighter, the new vehicle would have
the same firepower. For instance, Boeing engineers envision an
armored vehicle that would weigh about 16.5 tons, carry a lethal
laser gun and have advanced sensors that would give the crew the
ability to spot the enemy before it can be detected.</TE>
<TE>   The contract is one of the more significant moves yet by the
Pentagon to allow defense contractors to become so-called lead
systems integrators and have more responsibility in developing
military systems rather than individual weapons, vehicles or
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "They want us to define the architecture, and they're going to let
us pick out the best technology for it," said Felicia Campbell, a
Boeing spokeswoman. "This is a new way of doing acquisitions that is
very revolutionary for the Army."</TE>
<TE>   As such, the contract was highly sought by the defense firms,
although the initial award of $154 million is relatively small in
Pentagon terms. Lockheed Martin Co. and General Dynamics Corp., which
teamed with a bevy of defense firms, vied for the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing, which is partnered with San Diego-based Science
Applications International Corp., was considered an underdog because
its space and communications unit, although a large contractor for
the Air Force and spy agencies, had not done much work for the Army.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement of the contract award was made after the stock
market closed. Boeing shares declined $1.38 to $48.48 on Thursday on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The initial 16-month contract calls for Boeing to define the
concept for the combat systems. The Pentagon then plans to spend
$1billion a year for four years to have Boeing develop the system and
then begin testing prototypes.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the contract for Boeing could exceed $4billion
because it would have a say in what types of technologies to use. As
one of the largest defense contractors in the world, it already is
developing many of the technologies that could make up the elements
of the Army's future combat system.</TE>
<TE>   The Army is essentially asking Boeing to develop an "entire family
of weapon systems that are supposed to integrate the benefits of
digital technology into every facet of Army war fighting," Thompson
said. "It's supposed to create an entire integrated architecture."</TE>

<HD>Bush Shuns Proposal to Increase Execs' Liability</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Unveiling list of reforms, president says
shifting legal costs to officers could invite more suits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush rejected calls to hold corporate executives more
personally liable in investor lawsuits, fearing such a step might
spur a rash of litigation, administration officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In formally announcing a set of reforms designed to protect
investors from the kinds of abuses seen in the Enron Corp. collapse,
Bush said corporate officers must be held to a higher standard. He
proposed that executives who mislead investors or sign off on
inaccurate financial statements be required to return bonuses or be
barred from serving at public companies.</LD>
<LD>   "The people who run public companies owe a special obligation to
these investors, many of whom have put their savings and future
security on the line," the president said. "Reform should start at
the top. The chief executive officer has a daily duty to oversee the
entire enterprise."</LD>
<TE>   But Bush declined to endorse a proposal advocated by his own
Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, that would have made it harder
for corporate executives to rely on company-paid insurance policies
to pay the legal costs of defending them in cases brought by
investors or others claiming that the company misled them.</TE>
<TE>   The president feared such a requirement might encourage investors
to sue corporate officers, administration officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important to provide sound regulation and remedies where
needed, without inviting a rush of new lawsuits that exploit new
problems instead of solving them," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also decided that such a proposal was unnecessary because
insurers already have the power to refuse to cover legal costs
incurred by corporate officers and directors in the event of fraud or
willful misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats immediately blasted the president's plan as inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul O'Neill was much more aggressive in his recommendations
about what ought to be done," said Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the
Senate majority leader. "There is no penalty for corporate fraud in
the president's proposals.... So I think that it falls short of what
would have to be the minimum standards."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, who is part of the president's high-level working group
that is drafting post-Enron reforms, had proposed making it more
difficult for executives to use insurance coverage to cover the legal
costs of dealing with claims of negligence or misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The working group may still include such a provision in its own
recommendations, which have not yet been released.</TE>
<TE>   Bush unveiled a 10-point plan Thursday to protect shareholders,
improve corporate disclosure and tighten oversight of auditors.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would bar corporate executives from profiting from their
mistakes or lack of oversight by giving the Securities and Exchange
Commission the power to demand that bonuses and other
performance-based compensation be returned  if financial statements
are found to be misleading.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make sure that when there are material restatements of
earnings that can be traced to management or CEO errors, CEOs should
not be allowed to profit from those transactions," a senior
administration official said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Such a rule might have forced Enron officials to return millions
of dollars they collected through bonuses and stock options. But the
administration official stressed that the investors should not expect
a guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   "Businessmen can make boo-boos," the official said. "When you
invest in a company in which a businessman makes a mistake, a
business judgment mistake, no one wants to have anyone be guaranteed
for those returns. And we're trying to be very careful to steer away
from that issue and still leave investors on the hook for the choices
businessmen make about business."</TE>
<TE>   Another provision of the president's plan, similar to the ban on
securities brokers who act in bad faith, would bar executives who
abuse their power from serving as leaders of public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University, said the
president's plan is not as ambitious as other proposals but may
represent a good compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks pretty toothless, but it may be the best that you can
come up with from a political standpoint," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   He called O'Neill's proposal to make executives more personally
liable for legal bills "impractical."</TE>
<TE>   "If you did that, the best people won't become CEOs," Smith said.
"You won't be able to hire anybody who's good."</TE>
<TE>   He said such a government rule also would infringe on the
free-market rights of companies and insurers to decide the terms of
their policies.</TE>

<HD>Calif. to See Gas Prices Rise Again</HD>
<DH>Energy: Costs have been climbing because of refinery
problems, higher oil prices and increased demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California drivers should brace for a new surge in gasoline prices
brought about by refinery problems, higher oil prices and increased
demand, market watchers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Wholesale gasoline prices in Los Angeles and San Francisco have
jumped about 25 cents in the last week, and that increase is expected
to appear soon at the pump.</LD>
<LD>   "We are once again having a gasoline price spike" in California,
said Bob van der Valk, manager of fuel supply and marketing for Cosby
Oil Co., an independent fuel distributor in Santa Fe Springs.</LD>
<TE>   With wholesale prices jumping, "the dealer can eat it only so
long," Van der Valk said.</TE>
<TE>   California gasoline prices have been rising steadily for weeks
because of annual refinery maintenance, the yearly switch to
summer-grade gasoline and a boomlet in gasoline demand sparked by the
improving economy.</TE>
<TE>   The state's average price of self-serve regular gasoline was
$1.331 a gallon Monday, up 23 cents since the beginning of the year,
according to the Energy Information Administration.</TE>
<TE>   But wholesale prices turned on the afterburners this week in
California. Los Angeles spot price for regular grade gasoline leaped
10 cents a gallon on Thursday to 95.50 cents a gallon, according to
Bloomberg's energy price survey. That price does not include the
nearly 50 cents in federal, state and local taxes that are charged on
each gallon of gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   The wholesale market is being roiled by outages at the Valero
Energy Corp. refinery in Wilmington and the ChevronTexaco Corp.
refinery in Richmond, in northern California, said Mark Mahoney, West
Coast analyst for the Oil Price Information Service, a Lakewood,
N.J., company that tracks gasoline prices.</TE>
<TE>   The Valero refinery produces 50,000 barrels of gasoline a day and
the ChevronTexaco refinery produces 120,000 barrels of gasoline a
day--only a fraction of the 1 million barrels consumed daily in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   But because California's super-clean gasoline, required by
air-quality regulations, is produced primarily within the state, any
time a refinery has a problem there is an immediate tightening of
supplies followed by a price spike. A barrel holds 42 gallons of
gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got two units down and panic is setting in in the market,"
Mahoney said.</TE>
<TE>   Both refineries are expected to quickly fix their problems, which
should moderate price increases in a few weeks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the summer driving season is fast approaching and prices
nationwide, which have been hovering between $1.10 and $1.14 a gallon
on average for self-serve regular, could jump 15 cents to 20 cents a
gallon by mid-summer, well below the hikes of last summer, according
to the EIA, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy.</TE>
<TE>   Higher oil prices also are contributing to the latest gas price
increase.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil for April delivery rose 56 cents to close Thursday at
$23.71 a barrel, a 51/2-month high on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said oil rallied on expectations of an economic recovery
and nervousness about a possible expansion of the U.S. war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The California refinery problems and refinery outages in Texas
helped push gasoline for April delivery up as much as 2.35 cents to
76.38 cents a gallon on the Nymex, the highest price since Sept. 20.</TE>

<HD>Upbeat Greenspan Shakes Up Bonds</HD>
<DH>Markets: Yields surge as Fed chief says economic rebound is
'well underway.' Stocks ease; yen's value soars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After creeping higher for several days, Treasury bond yields rocketed
Thursday as Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan delivered more upbeat
news on the economy than bond traders could bear.</LD>
<LD>   But the stock market largely took the rise in yields in stride:
Key indexes closed just modestly lower, with the Dow industrials
losing 48.92 points, or 0.5%, to 10,525.37.</LD>
<LD>   In currency trading, the yen scored its biggest one-day gain
against the dollar in three years, as rebounding Japanese stocks
lured capital back to that country.</LD>
<TE>   The bond market provided some of the day's biggest fireworks, as
traders pushed longer-term yields sharply higher, sensing that a
reviving economy will lift interest rates across the board.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year T-note yield, which had bounced between 4.8% and 5.2%
for three months, jumped from 5.05% on Wednesday to 5.22%, its
highest since July.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year T-note is a benchmark for mortgage rates, which means
home buyers may face higher loan rates soon.</TE>
<TE>   The two-year T-note leaped to 3.42% from 3.23%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the trigger for the rate surge was a shift in tone
by the Fed boss: Last week he said the economy was "close to"
recovery, but on Thursday he told the Senate Banking Committee that a
rebound is "well underway."</TE>
<TE>   "Greenspan is always understated and reserved, so laymen won't
detect a dramatic shift in content. But I viewed this as very
significant," said economist Michael Moran at Daiwa Securities
America in New York. "He seemed to imply he was really thinking
differently than a week ago."</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, fresh data on the economy have been stronger than
most analysts expected. Another key report is due today, when the
government reports on February employment trends.</TE>
<TE>   All last year, the Fed's official "bias" was to minimize the
economic downturn by continuing to cut short-term interest rates.
Many analysts now expect the central bank's bias to change to
"neutral" at its next meeting, March 19--a first step toward raising
short-term rates to keep the economy from heating up to the point
that inflation could begin to threaten.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed cut its key short-term interest rate to a 40-year low of
1.75% in the weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--an emergency
measure that, as Moran said, "can't hold forever."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many experts believe Greenspan would prefer not to have to
tighten credit before summer at the earliest. And despite Thursday's
spike in bond yields, most analysts expect only moderate increases in
market interest rates in the near term. They said that continued low
inflation and a report Thursday showing that business productivity
grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter should keep a ceiling on the bond
market.</TE>
<TE>   Higher productivity allows businesses to make more money without
raising prices.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the bond market may be a little over-worried here," said
Jay Mueller, an economist at Strong Capital Management in Milwaukee.
"With inflation practically zero and productivity strong, I don't
think bonds should have too much trouble."</TE>
<TE>   But a sliding dollar could pose problems for the bond market
because a weak buck could fuel inflation in imported goods.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar has been the strong man of world currencies in recent
years, but it suffered a big hit Thursday, tumbling to 127.05 yen
from 130.88 on Wednesday after another surge in Japanese stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The Nikkei index rose 2.6% Thursday, boosting its gain this week
to 7.7%, as good news for the U.S. economy generated optimism about
Japan's outlook. Early today, the Nikkei was up 1.6% to 11,842.</TE>
<TE>   Sudi Mariappa, global portfolio manager at Pimco bond funds in
Newport Beach, said a number of other factors in Japan were
supporting the yen, including a rise in the country's leading
economic indicators, strong government support of stocks and banks,
and profit taking by speculators who had bet on a strong dollar and
cleaned up as the yen recently bottomed out at 135 per dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Some Japanese investment managers are selling foreign holdings to
invest in Japan as "window dressing" for their portfolios before the
country's fiscal year ends March 31, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   After mostly poor economic news in Japan since 1989, "the most
likely case is that international investors are underweighted in the
Japanese markets," Moran said. "When you start getting the sense that
things are turning, there could be a rush of investment into Japan."</TE>
<TE>   But if stock buyers are turning positive on Japan, they have even
more reason to be so about the United States, said economist Doug
Duncan at the Mortgage Bankers Assn., who this week raised his U.S.
growth forecast for the year to 3.5% from 1.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street was largely unshaken Thursday by the rise in bond
yields. Winners and losers were nearly even on the New York Stock
Exchange. On Nasdaq, the composite index slipped 8.77 points, or
0.5%, to 1,881.63, but still is up 4.4% this week.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the productivity numbers "unparalleled for a recession,"
Duncan also noted the recent surge in activity in both the
manufacturing and service sectors. The data suggest depressed
corporate earnings could begin to recover sooner rather than later,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The economy's recovery will cause the Fed to begin raising rates
again at midyear, Duncan predicted. That will take mortgage rates
higher as well, he said. Mortgage rates have stayed below 7% for five
straight weeks. This week, the average 30-year loan rate rose to
6.87% from 6.8% last week, Freddie Mac said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan expects the surge in Treasury yields to push the average
mortgage rate above 7% next week. He believes, though, that mortgage
rates will remain cheap by historical standards, averaging 7.3% in
the third quarter.</TE>

<HD>Tax Refund Average Increases 12%</HD>
<DH>Finances: Federal checks climb to $2,091. But for many,
bigger return is result of lower income due to job and investment
losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The average federal income tax refund has grown 12% so far this year
to $2,091, the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday. But tax
experts say the reasons behind the increase over last year aren't all
positive.</LD>
<LD>   Investment losses, job losses, pay cuts and declining returns on
money deposited in banks or money market funds left millions of
taxpayers with less taxable income last year.</LD>
<LD>   That means a bigger chunk of their withholding is being returned
in the form of refunds--$74 billion as of March 1.</LD>
<TE>   But the increase in the size of refund checks also is due to last
summer's tax law, which raised tax credits for families with
dependent children.</TE>
<TE>   An increase in charitable contributions also may be playing a
role.</TE>
<TE>   Economists said money from tax refunds tends to stimulate the
economy because it's often spent on consumer goods.</TE>
<TE>   But they cautioned that the effect may be muted this year because
of the reasons behind the increase.</TE>
<TE>   "In the abstract, tax refunds are stimulative to the economy,"
said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist with Wells Capital Management
in San Francisco. "You are putting more cash in peoples' hands, so
their purchasing power goes up."</TE>
<TE>   But for the roughly 1.8 million Americans who lost their jobs last
year, or the countless others who simply earned less, a higher refund
is less likely to get spent at the mall, Schlossberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Capital losses claimed by victims of last year's stock market
swoon played a particularly big role in buoying tax refunds this
year, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Well over half of my clients have investment losses in their
portfolios this year," said Philip J. Holthouse, partner with Los
Angeles tax law and accounting firm Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van Trigt.
"While in 1999 and 2000, these guys had difficulty finding losses to
offset their gains, this year it was easy to find losses--too easy."</TE>
<TE>   The rise in charitable contributions that followed the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks also may be contributing to higher refunds,
Holthouse said, because charitable donations can reduce a person's
taxable income.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in the child tax credit by $100 a child also has
helped boost refunds for many middle-income taxpayers, he said.
(High-income taxpayers can't claim the credit because it phases out
above set income levels.)</TE>
<TE>   Last year's tax law also lowered income tax rates for most
workers. But the rate cuts largely were passed on through rebate
checks mailed out last year and lower tax withholding during 2001,
according to the American Payroll Assn. in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The average refund amount is likely to decline as the filing
season progresses because taxpayers who expect to get the most money
back typically file the earliest. Those who owe money or expect small
refunds tend to file at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   At this point in last year's filing season, refund checks were
averaging $1,872. But the average fell to $1,743 by the time all the
refunds were calculated.</TE>
<TE>   Federal tax refunds have been rising steadily for a decade, and
that's a source of concern for tax experts and the IRS.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason people are getting these refunds is because they paid
too much tax through withholding during the year," said Rita Ziedner,
a spokeswoman for the American Payroll Assn. "It's a shame that so
many taxpayers are giving Uncle Sam an interest-free loan. They would
be much better served to put this money in their own interest-bearing
accounts."</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers should try to do better next year, said Suzzanne
Brubaker, a director at Deloitte &amp; Touche in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It is giving us a good opportunity to encourage clients to look
at their overall financial plan," she said. "We are encouraging our
clients to do some good projections for 2002 to get their withholding
at the right level."</TE>

<HD>Actors' Health Benefits Taking a Hit</HD>
<DH>Labor: Members who don't meet higher income standards will
lose coverage; those who keep it will pay more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They have long been considered Mercedes-Benzs among health insurance
plans, and their generous benefits have helped make up for the
sporadic paydays endured by most members of the Screen Actors Guild.</LD>
<LD>   But the fast-changing economics of health care have caught up with
the Screen Actors Guild-Producers Pension and Health Plans: Members
are being notified that many of them will be dropped from the plans
over the next few years and those who manage to stay in will pay
considerably more.</LD>
<LD>   At a time of double-digit annual health-care cost increases fueled
by rising spending on drugs and aggressive price hikes by doctors and
hospitals, the sticker shock facing SAG members is typical of what is
happening to workers around the country.</LD>
<TE>   Even union-negotiated health plans, with gold-plated benefits that
have been taken for granted for years, are being downsized to reflect
the new realities.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is immune from these cost increases," said Kirby Bosley of
the Los Angeles office of William M. Mercer, an employee benefits
consulting firm. "Not even the entertainment industry."</TE>
<TE>   At a time when the guild acknowledges that up to 75% of its
membership fails to earn the bare minimum of annual income required
to maintain SAG benefits, the changes, which take effect Jan. 1,
2003, will mean that a much smaller percentage will qualify in the
years to come.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of income that actors will have to earn to qualify for
the SAG health plans will increase 32% to 71% from 2003 to 2008,
depending on which plan they are in.</TE>
<TE>   SAG health-plan administrators said they were forced to make the
changes in response to economic conditions that are becoming common
in the nation's health-care system, along with an additional factor
peculiar to the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   Although the qualifying earnings requirement held at $7,500 a year
since 1996, the costs of providing health benefits rose from $102
million in 1996 to an estimated $152 million in 2001. Prescription
drug costs, for example, rose 142%, from $9.5 million to an estimated
$23 million.</TE>
<TE>   And although the number of SAG members enrolled in the plans
increased by 17% over those five years to 40,156, members'
contributions to the plans declined, which the guild blames on a
decrease in members' earnings because of runaway productions to
Canada, Australia and other foreign locales.</TE>
<TE>   "Earnings were not keeping up with costs even in robust times,"
said Bruce Dow, administrative director for the SAG health plans.
"Last year, we ran a $9-million deficit in our self-pay plan" for
actors who don't qualify for SAG benefits but are allowed to keep
their health coverage by paying the full cost.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that many SAG actors will be forced to moderate career
aspirations to find health benefits elsewhere or hope that they
remain healthy, if uninsured. Others say that the changes won't solve
the union's problems and that it will be under increasing pressure to
offer a third option: low-cost, bare-bones health care to a majority
of its members.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Union Under Pressure to 'Help the Small People'</TE>
<TE>   SAG's problems are not unlike those facing other union-negotiated
health plans, which typically feature generous benefits at low cost
to members, said Alan M. Garber, professor of medicine and director
of the Stanford University Center for Health Policy. But with fewer
and fewer members able to qualify for those benefits, SAG "will be
under pressure to help the small people."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no easy solution," added Garber. "There will be pressure
to offer a low-cost plan to cover more members, and a pretty good
low-cost plan at that."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the actors and actresses contacted for this story were
unaware of the new requirements, and were staggered by the extent of
them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably going to be impossible for me to earn enough now
and I'm not sure I should even try," said 65-year-old Andre
Marcellus, a Santa Monica-based actor who has done national
commercials and small roles on "Murder One," "NYPD Blue" and "Star
Trek: Voyager" television series. "I've been acting since the 1970s
and most years I didn't make much more than $1,000. It's only in the
last eight years that I've been able to make $7,500."</TE>
<TE>   There are two SAG health plans for actors. Plan II, the lower-cost
option, pays 100% for many procedures by providers that are in the
network.</TE>
<TE>   Plan I provides 100% coverage for doctors and hospitals in and out
of the network. In California, SAG health plans use Blue Cross
preferred provider network. For all out-of-state actors, the plans
use Private Health Care System.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 2003, actors will have to earn $9,000 in SAG contract
earnings or work 61 days, instead of the $7,500 or 60 days that have
been required since 1996. That will rise steadily to $11,000 in 2007,
an increase of 32% over 2002.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Plan I members either had to have $15,000 in SAG wages
or $7,500 in wages combined with 10 years of earned eligibility,
meaning 10 years of earning enough to qualify for SAG benefits.
Beginning in 2003, credit for earned eligibility for Plan I will be
dropped and all Plan I members will have to earn $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   That requirement also will rise steadily to $26,000 in SAG wages
in 2007, an increase of 42% for those who do not meet the earned
eligibility discount and an increase of 71% for those who do get the
discount and choose to remain in Plan I in the coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Those able to meet the new standards will face other cost
increases, such as a more than doubling of deductibles for major
medical procedures and higher co-payments.</TE>
<TE>   So-called A-list actors, who account for 2% of guild membership,
won't be affected by the benefits changes because their annual
incomes exceed the cutoff.</TE>
<TE>   And the so-called middle-income actor, such as someone in a
recurring support role on a television series, will make enough
annually to qualify for coverage, said Ilyanne Morden Kichaven,
spokesperson for SAG.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Most Actors Will Feel Benefits Changes Deeply</TE>
<TE>   But the vast majority of actors, who work infrequently and earn
little, will feel it deeply.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Muniz of Sierra Madre, for example, earned her SAG
membership in a role in the 1998 movie "Judas Kiss." But since then,
the 26-year-old Puerto Rico native has been unable to earn the $7,500
required for health coverage. She had one nationally televised
commercial for Tylenol in 2001 and recently shot her second
commercial, a spot for Coors Light.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised. I'm shocked. That's a really big increase," said
Muniz when informed of the new earnings requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Muniz said that she had been looking forward to qualifying because
she hasn't been to a dentist in three years and remembered a veteran
actress telling her how well her son was cared for after a car
accident.</TE>
<TE>   "She went on and on about how great the SAG health plan was. Great
benefits, great doctors," Muniz said. "Now that just seems farther
and farther away from me."</TE>
<TE>   Muniz said that she is considering a different career, as a yoga
instructor, so that she can earn enough to buy health coverage. In
the meantime, she said, "I'm just trying to stay healthy and go out
on a lot of auditions."</TE>
<TE>   Marcellus is in a different quandary. At 65, he had hoped to work
two more years to have 10 years of earned eligibility, but that won't
matter under the new standards. Marcellus is a former member of the
Army's 11th Airborne Division so he can at least rely on veterans'
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that one good job would take care of it, get you
over the earnings requirement," Marcellus said. "That won't be the
case anymore."</TE>

<KH>PACIFIC 10 TOURNAMENT AT STAPLES CENTER</KH>
<HD>It's Too Late for Bruins</HD>
<DH>College basketball: At the end of a long day, UCLA falls to
California, 67-61.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first Pacific 10 Conference tournament in 12 years purports to
offer something for everybody.</LD>
<LD>   Delivering is a very different story.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA wanted redemption, but it didn't get it. California held off
the Bruins, 67-61, before a near-sellout crowd at Staples Center that
exhibited impressive stamina given the hour.</LD>
<TE>   Cal will face Arizona in the semifinals tonight.</TE>
<TE>   California wanted national visibility. It came away with a
victory, yet on the East Coast the post-midnight start was later than
Letterman.</TE>
<TE>   Even in L.A., television viewers had to choose between the last
several minutes of the game and Jay Leno's monologue.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two minutes into the second half, UCLA took its first
lead since the game's early stages on Jason Kapono's 15-foot
fall-away, but Cal rattled off nine points in a row, with Ryan
Forehan-Kelly making two three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Gadzuric answered with his first two baskets of the game,
pulling UCLA within four points.</TE>
<TE>   Was anybody out there watching?</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't have a better time to have a tournament in terms of
where the league is and for exposure for the league," Cal Coach Ben
Braun said before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly he didn't mean time of day. There was no exposure for
either team except for bleary bar patrons and insomniacs. Notoriously
late-night World Series games are "Good Morning America" compared to
this.</TE>
<TE>   A shot-clock malfunction delayed the second half of the
Oregon-Washington game--the first of four--by 12 minutes, but Pac-10
officials were indifferent to punctuality thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   No. 6-seeded UCLA and No. 3 Cal tipped off 35 minutes late at 9:35
p.m, and the Bears soon took the upper hand, leading, 28-19, with
eight minutes left in the first half by working the ball into the
paint for runners and layups.</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric, the UCLA center, had double-doubles in both
regular-season encounters between the teams, but he had few touches
and was scoreless in the half and did not make a basket until
finishing a fastbreak with a dunk five minutes into the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins trailed, 34-31, at halftime, staying within reach by
making seven three-point baskets, three by Matt Barnes--who scored 12
points--two by Kapono and one each by Billy Knight and Dijon
Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the Bruins were sloppy, committing 11 turnovers and
appearing as tentative offensively as they did in last week's loss to
Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   No one from Braun's no-name roster was named to the All-Pac-10
team. No Bear was in the top 10 in scoring or rebounds or three-point
shooting. Or in the top five in assists or steals.</TE>
<TE>   This game was no different. Eight Bears scored in the first
half--Joe Shipp and Forehan-Kelly each had nine--and Cal had 12
assists.</TE>
<TE>   Home court proved crucial in these teams' two previous meetings.</TE>
<TE>   At Berkeley, the Bruins came out wearing headbands for solidarity
and left in tatters, losing by 18 points. At Pauley Pavilion, UCLA
held a steady lead most of the game and won decisively. Part of the
appeal of a conference tournament is that it is played on a somewhat
neutral court.</TE>
<TE>   "This tournament is an important tune-up and dress rehearsal for
[the NCAA tournament]," UCLA Coach Steve Lavin said. "The bright
lights of the Staples Center with the shot background and the feel of
a different floor all prepare us.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pac-10 tournament gives teams a chance to get rid of the
deer-in-headlights feeling before next week."</TE>
<TE>   That would be the NCAA tournament, which should start on time.</TE>

<HD>Molina Bounces Back After Difficult Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>"I lost probably half of my heart," Bengie Molina said.</LD>
<LD>   Last summer could scarcely have been crueler for the Angels'
catcher, for reasons that render an injury or a batting slump
trivial. His grandmother died. His wife suffered a miscarriage. His
mother was hospitalized with a kidney infection. His father left the
family's Puerto Rico home and moved in with another woman.</LD>
<LD>   "I lost my grandmother and I kind of lost my dad," Molina said.
"He betrayed our family."</LD>
<TE>   Molina was an unheralded star of the Angels' 2000 season. After
seven seasons in the minor leagues, the Angels anointed him their
catcher. He hit .281 with 14 home runs, finishing third in
rookie-of-the-year voting.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an injury-riddled minor league career, the Angels signed
him last spring to a contract guaranteeing him $4.2 million over four
years. After dedicating himself to conditioning in off-season
workouts, he nevertheless suffered a partially torn right hamstring
and missed two months, an injury he said was "devastating" but ended
up among the least of his concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "People think, if you get paid, you should perform," Molina said.
"They don't know what's going on. But that's OK. Hopefully I can
perform this year."</TE>
<TE>   Molina played in 96 games last season, down from 130 the previous
year, and hit .262 with six home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has their own personal problems," he said. "I have to
try to work through them. I think I was tough enough to play through
them."</TE>
<TE>   He prays that this season is better. His wife is healthy; so is
his mother. He is happy that, in a sport that can separate families
by thousands of miles, he can see his brother every day, at least for
now. Jose Molina, also a catcher, is in training camp with the Angels
but is expected to start the season at triple-A Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia, aware of Bengie Molina's injury history,
said he will try to prevent extended absences by resting him at the
first sign of injury and said he hopes Molina can catch 120 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon hit his first home run of the spring as the Angels
played to a 10-10 tie with the Chicago White Sox on Thursday. Bart
Miadich, trying to win the one available bullpen job, inherited a
10-7 lead in the ninth and gave up three runs on two hits, two walks
and a hit batter.</TE>
<TE>   The news was not good for center-field prospect Nathan Haynes, who
injured his thumb Wednesday. Haynes went for an MRI exam Thursday
night, and if it reveals a torn ligament, he could need the same
surgery that sidelined shortstop Gary DiSarcina for seven weeks in
1995. If the ligament is sprained, doctors might immobilize it
anyway, and Haynes could miss about a month.</TE>
<TE>   As minor league camps open this week, the post-Sept. 11 visa
crackdown that revealed the true and older ages of many Latin
American major leaguers now extends to minor leaguers. The Angels
discovered that Dominican right-hander Joel Peralta, who saved 23
games at Class-A Cedar Rapids last season, will turn 26 this month,
not 22. Another Dominican right-hander, Hatuey Mendoza, is 23, not
22.</TE>
<TE>   In the first roster cuts of the spring, the Angels plan to send
catcher Jared Abruzzo and pitchers Bobby Jenks, Rich Kelley, Tony
Milo and Francisco Rodriguez to minor league camp after today's
split-squad games.</TE>

<HD>Victory Is Child's Play for Wildcats</HD>
<DH>First round: Walton shows poise and scores 25 points as
Arizona wins state battle, 73-56.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chip-off-the-old-block was a few inches shorter than the original
version, and the uniform he wore wasn't the powder blue of UCLA's
Bruins. But everything else was like a flashback Thursday night at
Staples Center, when Luke Walton scored 25 points and led Arizona to
an impressive 73-56 victory over Arizona State in the first round of
the Pacific 10 basketball tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Walton, of course, is the son of Bill, among the all-time greats
to play anywhere, much less UCLA, where he left a legacy of
excellence and national championships in the John Wooden era.</LD>
<LD>   Son Luke, now a junior at Arizona, wasn't as highly touted coming
out of high school in San Diego, but he is beginning to be a great
argument for recruiting the genes rather than the prep performance.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't so much what Walton did in his 34-minute performance,
which included eight rebounds, two assists and two blocked shots, but
how he did it. He scored when it mattered most, he missed only six of
17 shots and none of those were bad ones, and he played with a poise
and presence, as well as an intelligence, that probably even
impresses that 6-foot-11 chatty broadcaster back home.</TE>
<TE>   "Luke had an exceptional game tonight," Arizona Coach Lute Olson
said.</TE>
<TE>   So did teammate Jason Gardner, the co-star of this 15th-ranked
Wildcats, who played the entire game and got 22 points, making all 12
free throws he shot.</TE>
<TE>   Olson wasn't especially happy with his team's 21-of-31 foul
shooting, but compared to the Sun Devils--on this night the gang that
couldn't shoot straight--Arizona was stellar.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State, which shot 34% from the floor, was two for 12 from
the free-throw line, including 0 for 7 in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not usually a bad foul-shooting team," said Coach Rob
Evans, whose team fell to 14-14.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's victory gave the veteran Olson yet another 20-win
season, his 24th in a 29-year career. The last time Olson, who won an
NCAA title in 1997, didn't win 20 games was in the 1986-87 season,
when he was 18-12 and still finished second in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   Olson didn't achieve what he has without being smart and cool
about it. His Wildcats will play the winner of the late Cal-UCLA game
in tonight's semifinals, so the veteran coach knew there was no need
to be celebrating anything quite yet.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy we got this one," Olson said, in appropriate
understatement.</TE>

<LD>Chicago Cub closer Tom Gordon, forced to walk off the mound this week
after hurting himself, has a "severe" shoulder injury and will be
sidelined for the foreseeable future.</LD>
<LD>   The Cubs had counted on Gordon to come back strong from an
injury-plagued season. Instead, a second MRI exam Thursday confirmed
their worst fears.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a significant injury that's going to require significant
time off," Cub President Andy MacPhail said. "We don't have a time
frame yet."</LD>

<TE>   Major League Baseball placed two umpires on two years of probation
in 1989 after a secret investigation into gambling, the New York
Daily News reported today.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said John Dowd, also the investigator in the Pete
Rose gambling probe, wrote the report that led to the sanctions
against then-umpires Frank Pulli and Rich Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Dowd told the newspaper that Pulli and Garcia were sanctioned for
placing bets with "local bookies," and cooperated fully with the
investigation.</TE>

<HD>Pacific Eliminates Northridge</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cal State Northridge and Pacific appeared evenly matched when they
took the court Thursday for their first-round game in the Big West
Conference tournament. They had finished tied for third place in
league play with 11-7 records and had split their season series.</LD>
<LD>   But Pacific's edge in experience was evident in a 78-66 victory at
the Anaheim Convention Center, a victory that extended the Tigers'
winning streak to six games and propelled them into tonight's
semifinals against Utah State. Last year, Utah State defeated Pacific
in the championship game.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific (20-9) got a career-high 19 points and 12 rebounds from
senior center Mike Preston and a career-high 21 points and nine
rebounds from fourth-year junior forward Eli Nolan, ending
Northridge's four-game winning streak and its first season as a
member of the Big West.</LD>
<TE>   Pacific, with eight seniors, broke open the game after Northridge
had tied the score, 44-44, with 13 minutes 38 seconds left. The
Tigers went on an 18-4 run in the next five minutes and led by 15
points with 7:22 left.</TE>
<TE>   "That's probably the best second half we played all year," said
Pacific Coach Bob Thomason, who is trying to lead the Tigers into
their fourth tournament final in six years.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge (12-16) was hoping that its mix of full- and half-court
presses would unnerve the Tigers and force turnovers that would
result in easy baskets. But Pacific handled the pressure well and
committed only 14 turnovers. The Tigers outrebounded the Matadors,
38-30, and shot 50%. Pacific held Northridge point guard Markus Carr
to 15 points on five-of-16 shooting. The Matadors shot only 30% in
the second half and had no answer inside for the 6-foot-9 Preston,
who had nine offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew their perimeter guys we're pretty good, so sometimes we
left our post men down there on an island, sort of playing one on
one," said Northridge forward Ian Boylan, a freshman who scored 16 of
his 17 points in the first half. "Their post men did a good job
getting close to the basket, getting fouled and getting easy
buckets."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific began its pivotal run when Northridge freshman Chris Davis
was called for a technical foul after he fouled Preston with 12:36
left. Demetrius Jackson made two free throws, Preston made two more
and the Tigers never looked back as Preston made a shot and Nolan
made consecutive three-point shots to fuel the run.</TE>
<TE>   Utah State 61, Idaho 41--Utah State, the two-time defending
tournament champion but loser of its last two regular-season games,
reversed that trend by holding the Vandals to the lowest point total
of any opponent this season.</TE>
<TE>   Center Jeremy Vague scored 14 points and forward Desmond Penigar
had 12 for Utah State (22-6), which committed only nine turnovers,
shot 55% and limited Idaho to 32% shooting. Forward Rodney Hilaire
and center Matt Gerschefske each had 10 points for Idaho (9-19).</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara 74, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 65--Santa Barbara
(18-10) advanced to the semifinals against Irvine by defeating the
Mustangs for the ninth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos extended a 30-26 halftime lead to a 56-41 advantage
with seven minutes left. Cal Poly (15-12) cut the deficit to 59-50
with 2:52 left but Santa Barbara held on.</TE>

<LD>NO. 4 PACIFIC (20-9) vs. NO. 1 UTAH STATE (22-6), 6--This game is a
rematch of last year's tournament final, which was won by Utah State,
50-38. The Aggies went on to upset Ohio State in an NCAA tournament
first-round game. Utah State took a step toward winning its third
consecutive Big West tournament by dispatching Idaho, 61-41, on
Thursday. Pacific will be no such pushover. The Tigers, who defeated
Cal State Northridge, 78-66, have reached the tournament final three
times in the last five years.</LD>
<LD>   No. 2 UC IRVINE (21-9) vs. No. 3 UC SANTA BARBARA (18-10),
8:30--Irvine beat Long Beach State, 72-65, and is in the semifinals
for the second year in a row. The Anteaters got a big game from
sophomore center Adam Parada against the 49ers and they will need
another against a Santa Barbara team that ranks among the best in the
nation in field-goal percentage defense at 37.6%.</LD>

<LD>The Pacific 10 men's basketball tournament at Staples Center
showcases some of the nation's best teams. But on an individual and
team basis, it's not the most prestigious college hoops tournament
ever held in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   That distinction goes to the eight-team L.A. Classic of the late
1950s and 1960s at the Sports Arena. It featured such players as
Jerry West of West Virginia, Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek of Ohio
State, Billy "the Hill" McGill of Utah, John Rudometkin of USC and
Dave Bing of Syracuse.</LD>
<LD>   For example, in the tournament championship game in December 1959,
California met West Virginia in a rematch of their NCAA title game
the previous spring. Pete Newell's Golden Bears won again, 65-45.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike other tournaments that have been called "Classics," this
one lived up to its name.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA record for steals in a season?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Try the floor: Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle
writes that weird baseball injuries are starting to pile up.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, Cleveland pitcher C.C. Sabathia said he had a sore
back last weekend because he slept wrong, and explained: "I slept on
four pillows, and I think my neck was too high off the bed."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he could confirm Sabathia slept in an awkward position,
Cleveland Manger Charlie Manuel said, "I don't know. I don't sleep
with him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wrong place to peep: Jeanne Maddox, a 5-foot-10 forward for the
Georgetown (Ky.) women's basketball team, caught an intruder in her
dorm room Monday night, chased him outside and pinned him to the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Wayne Coyle, 27, faces charges of criminal mischief and
burglary. He entered the room about midnight, college officials said.
After he was chased outside, he tripped on the lawn and was held down
by Maddox.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keep 'em locked up: NBC will air the Arena Football League, whose
playoffs on ESPN last year attracted less than 1% of cable TV
households and whose title game on ABC the past two years drew about
1% of households.</TE>
<TE>   Said Michael Heistand of USA Today: "Industry insiders know such
results simply might result from household pets accidentally hitting
TV remote controls."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He's hooked: Charles Barkley bet $500,000 on the New England
Patriots in the Super Bowl in Las Vegas and won $1.2 million.
"Gambling is my vice and I'll have to address it sometime in the
future," he told Sports Illustrated. "But not now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1987, UCLA defeated Washington,
76-64, at Pauley Pavilion to win the inaugural men's Pacific 10
tournament basketball championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Alvin Robertson of San Antonio, 301, in 1985-86.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News is on a
crusade to abolish politically incorrect sports symbols. A sampling:
"No ethnic names. This my first decree. This will not only do away
with Indians and Braves and Eskimos and Seminoles but the Fighting
Irish and Celtics, too.</TE>
<TE>   "Curb any inclination to change the Nuggets to the Mummies, no
matter the resemblance, and no special points to Cleveland for
finally, for brief periods of this season, playing baseball without
the buck-toothed Chief Wahoo on their caps."</TE>

<HD>Pittsburgh Makes an Impression</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pittsburgh might be the beast of the Big East.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 7 Panthers (26-4) rolled through Boston College, 76-62, in
the quarterfinals of the conference tournament Thursday at New York.</LD>
<LD>   The Eagles (20-11) broke to a 20-15 lead with six minutes left in
the first half, then the Panthers went on a 21-4 run to take a 36-24
halftime lead.</LD>
<TE>   Boston College never challenged after that.</TE>
<TE>   "In a game when you're down, you have to do damage in the first
six or seven minutes of the second half," Eagle Coach Al Skinner
said. "We didn't. We didn't execute well and they got transition
baskets and built the lead."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh never panicked and waited for its opportunity. When it
came, the Panthers made their move.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't get concerned when we're down," Pittsburgh Coach Ben
Howland said. "We defended and rebounded and did what we wanted to
do."</TE>
<TE>   It's a formula Pittsburgh has used in winning eight games in a row
and 11 of the last 12. The Panthers wore down Boston College and had
a 40-23 rebounding edge.</TE>
<TE>   "Our players are strong and physical," Howland said. "We don't get
pushed around. We have depth. We're nine or 10 deep and all of them
are good."</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers will play No. 20 Miami (24-6), which defeated
Georgetown, 84-76, in overtime. The Hoyas are 19-11. St. John's
(20-11) was eliminated with an 83-63 loss to Notre Dame (21-9). The
Fighting Irish will play No. 19 Connecticut (22-6), which defeated
Villanova, 72-70. The Wildcats are 17-12.</TE>

Purdue (13-18). The Hawkeyes play Wisconsin today.... Michigan
(11-17) took advantage of Northwestern's sluggish play to start both
halves and defeated the Wildcats, 72-51. The Wolverines play Ohio

<TE>   BIG 12</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ellis scored 27 points and Andre Emmett added 24 at Kansas
City, Mo., as Texas Tech defeated Texas A&amp;M, 80-71, in a game
interrupted by the collapse on press row of veteran author and
sportswriter Bob Hammel. Hammel, 66, the former sports editor of the
Bloomington Herald-Times and a friend of Red Raider Coach Bob Knight,
was sitting courtside when he collapsed with about 6:30 left in the
second half. The co-author of Knight's recently released
autobiography, Hammel was taken away on a stretcher. Kansas City TV
station WDAF said Hammel had a low blood-sugar diabetic seizure and
was expected to recover. While paramedics attended to Hammel, Knight
went across the court several times to watch closely. After the game,
Knight jumped into a waiting patrol car and went immediately to St.
Luke's hospital, where Hammel was hospitalized. Texas Tech (22-7)
will play Oklahoma State today. The Aggies finished 9-22.</TE>

in the semifinals. The 49ers (18-10) defeated Tulane, 78-69, ending
the Green Wave's season at 14-15.</TE>

<HD>It's a Brand New Day for Elton</HD>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Elton Brand tried his best to make his homecoming seem like no big
deal, but then he let it slip how much he loves being a Clipper.</LD>
<LD>   "It was 74 degrees when we left L.A. on Tuesday and it was, what,
14 and snowing here?" Brand told reporters after the team practiced
Thursday morning at Moody Bible Institute. "When I was pulling on my
hat and my gloves today, I was saying how I don't really miss it that
much."</LD>
<LD>   Brand was a Chicago Bull for two trying seasons, winning 17 games
as a rookie in 1999-2000 and 15 last season, before he was traded
last summer to the Clippers for the draft rights to Tyson Chandler
and Brian Skinner. He said he rarely follows his former team and
communicates infrequently with his old teammates.</LD>
<TE>   Plus, there aren't that many of them left. Tim Floyd was fired as
coach and replaced by Bill Cartwright and only four players remain
from last season's roster, including Marcus Fizer.</TE>
<TE>   "Brad Miller used to call me and say, 'Hey, we won,'" Brand said.
"But he's not here anymore [after a trade last month with the Indiana
Pacers]. I still talk to Marcus some on the two-way pager. I try not
to put myself in a Bulls' uniform anymore. I've moved on."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the sort of reaction he expects from Bull fans
tonight, Brand joked, "Reception-wise I should get the 21/2-minute
Jordan ovation."</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a more serious tone, he acknowledged he might hear a few
boos once the game begins.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson, a Chicago native who played at DePaul, bought
100 tickets for family and friends for tonight's game. Darius Miles,
who hails from East St. Louis, Ill., bought 25. Brand purchased
eight.... Richardson suffered a bruised right thigh during practice
and his status for tonight was termed questionable.</TE>

<TE>   Update--After winning three in a row, the Bulls have lost five of
six. Chandler, a former standout at Compton Dominguez High, has been
sidelined for three games because of a hyperextended left little
finger and is listed as doubtful. The Clippers have defeated the
Bulls in three in a row.</TE>

<HD>Injury Slows Goodwin a Little</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KISSIMMEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Pitchers Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby are on the mend, and right
fielder Shawn Green and second baseman Mark Grudzielanek are
improving, but an already bustling Dodger training room grew a little
more crowded Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Center fielder Tom Goodwin strained a muscle on his left side
swinging a bat in a simulated game Wednesday and will be sidelined
for several days.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a bad injury to have, considering how much you have to use
those muscles when you're swinging and throwing; it can affect
everything," said Goodwin, who was scratched from Thursday's 4-2
exhibition loss to the Houston Astros. "It's sore today. I can feel
the pain. But it's nothing I couldn't play with."</LD>
<TE>   Goodwin, who has a $3.25-million guaranteed contract but is in
danger of not making the team, hasn't distinguished himself in the
four-man competition for the center-field job; he has one hit and two
walks in 10 spring-training at-bats. Any injury would diminish what
little trade value Goodwin might have.</TE>
<TE>   But Manager Jim Tracy said the injury won't put Goodwin any
further behind Marquis Grissom, McKay Christensen and Dave Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's out for a few days, it won't be a problem," Tracy said.
"If he was out for a long time ... that would be difficult for a
young guy, but we know Tom Goodwin, and we know what he's been
working on. It won't be held against him."</TE>
<TE>   Green, slowed by a mild case of tendinitis in his left shoulder,
took part in throwing drills Thursday morning and hopes to make his
first exhibition appearance in the field this weekend. Grudzielanek
hasn't played in a Grapefruit League game because of a sore right
hamstring but was feeling better Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Brown and Ashby, both recovering from elbow surgery, are scheduled
to pitch Sunday against Houston. Japanese left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii
is scheduled to make his first exhibition appearance today against
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Hideo Nomo gave up one run and three hits in three
innings of Thursday's game and threw several nasty split-finger
fastballs, one of which struck out Brian Hunter to end the third
inning. Nomo also threw first-pitch strikes to seven of the 12
batters he faced.</TE>
<TE>   "A better first-pitch efficiency will make him an even better
pitcher," Tracy said. "His first-pitch ratio last year wasn't very
good."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo went 13-10 with a 4.50 earned-run average for Boston in 2001,
and led the American League with 220 strikeouts. Opponents hit .231
against Nomo, .407 on the first pitch but only .172 after falling
behind in the count, 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concentrating harder on keeping the ball low and throwing
first-pitch strikes," Nomo said.</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Paul Quantrill retired the side in order in the sixth,
and catcher Paul Lo Duca had two hits, but Tracy grew more concerned
about defensive lapses. First baseman Dave Hansen and third baseman
Mike Kinkade committed errors that enabled Houston to score, and the
Dodgers have 14 errors in six games.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to give the opponent unnecessary opportunities,"
Tracy said, "because our pitching staff is beginning to show me that
it's not going to be the easiest thing in the world to score runs off
the Dodgers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who says an older pitcher can't learn new tricks? Dodger Hall of
Famer Sandy Koufax has spent a lot of time in camp this spring, and
left-hander Terry Mulholland, 39, has taken advantage, seeking advice
from Koufax about the grip on his curveball.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he had the greatest curve of any left-hander in the
game, 'I'd like to know how you did it,'" Mulholland said. "He was
more than obliged to show me, and he worked with me. You can't really
argue with the success he had with it. I'm always willing, even at
this age and stage of my career, to try something new."</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland, who is competing for a bullpen job, had trouble
controlling the curve in his first outing, but he looked sharp in his
next game, throwing three scoreless innings against Florida on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kinkade, one of several players competing for a utility job,
sprained his right knee on a fifth-inning groundout. He was scheduled
for examination Thursday night.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>McDonald Is Close to Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy McDonald spent much of the season proving he belonged with the
Mighty Ducks. Then, after removing many doubts, he had to miss games
because of a concussion.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald, who suffered from headaches and nausea after a game
against Minnesota on Feb. 27, skated for the first time since that
game on Thursday. He will not play tonight, when the Ducks take on
New Jersey, but said he hoped to return to the lineup Sunday, when
the Ducks play Ottawa.</LD>
<LD>   "The last two days were really the first time I've felt 100%,"
McDonald said Thursday. "I rode the [stationary] bike [Wednesday] and
was able to get on the ice [Thursday].</LD>
<TE>   "It was a weird injury because at no point in the game did I take
a hit to the head. After the game, I was not feeling all that well. I
felt a little slow and really tired."</TE>
<TE>   The concussion interrupted a big season for McDonald. He has been
a creative and effective player, with six goals and 25 points in 35
games since being recalled in December.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald is not alone, as the Ducks' injury list grows.</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's game against Atlanta, defenseman Pavel Trnka had to
leave in the second period because of a severe headache, then right
wing Dan Bylsma missed the third period because of chest pains.</TE>
<TE>   Bylsma underwent a series of tests that showed no serious
problems, and he is expecting to play tonight. Trnka, however,
underwent tests and Duck officials said he is day to day with neck
spasms.</TE>
<TE>   Center Marc Chouinard also is out because of a shoulder injury
that Duck officials are now saying is more serious than they first
let on.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Jonas Ronnqvist was recalled from minor league Cincinnati
to fill the void left by injuries.</TE>

remain with the Devils. Holik has 19 goals and 40 points. Devil
defenseman Scott Niedermayer is questionable tonight because of a
pinched nerve.</TE>

<HD>Long Putts Help Faxon Take Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Faxon has putted well for as long as he can remember. He doesn't
know why or how. But if he tries to analyze his skill too much, he
will mess it all up.</LD>
<LD>   So he just putts.</LD>
<LD>   Faxon made two 30-footers and four more from beyond 10 feet
Thursday. He shot a seven-under 65 and was the clubhouse leader when
heavy rain suspended the opening round of the Honda Classic at Coral
Springs, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   "I try to putt like it's shooting baskets with your friends,"
Faxon said. "I try to make it so easy and simple and thoughtless....
I putted great. I had good feel around the greens. I saw the lines.
But that's when I putt my best: When it's easy.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there's no explanation for that or nothing that will sell
a book, but I don't really worry about that."</TE>
<TE>   Faxon birdied four of his final five holes, getting off the TPC at
Heron Bay just before play was suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two inches of rain had fallen when the first round was
postponed in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Skip Kendall, having teed off on the 16th when play was stopped,
was one shot behind Faxon and one stroke ahead of Fulton Allem,
Per-Ulrik Johansson, Dudley Hart and Michael Allen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Thomas Bjorn shot a five-under-par 67 for a
share of the first-round lead at the Dubai Desert Classic in United
Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Bjorn, coming back from a shoulder injury, was tied with Robert
Karlsson after a five-birdie, no-bogey round at Emirates Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   "It was different out there and it certainly felt like I hadn't
played golf for a while," said Bjorn, a Dane who makes Dubai his
winter home. "I felt nervous early on and the decisions on the shots
were hard to make."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dollar Bill, one of the most overrated horses to run in recent years,
will make his comeback in today's ninth race at the Fair Grounds in
New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Gary and Mary West and trained by Dallas Stewart, the son
of Peaks And Valleys became one of the supposed leading candidates
for the 2001 Kentucky Derby after winning the Kentucky Jockey Club at
Churchill Downs in the fall of 2000 and the Risen Star at the Fair
Grounds early last year.</LD>
<LD>   He then had a very troubled trip in the Louisiana Derby, winding
up fourth, beaten by only 21/2 lengths at 17-10. He had problems in
other races, but the bottom line is he hasn't won since the Risen
Star some 121/2 months ago.</LD>
<TE>   Idle since finishing third behind Point Given and E Dubai in the
Travers on Aug. 25 and after having a bone chip removed from one of
his knees, Dollar Bill will be trying to end a six-race losing streak
this afternoon. His opponents at a mile and 40 yards include On Your
Mark, Valid Prime, Storm Cruiser, Connected, True Concern, Desert
Demon, Tahkodha Hills and Miner's Prize.</TE>
<TE>   Robby Albarado will ride the 4-year-old for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   At Gulfstream Park, Pleasant County, whose fifth-place finish at
2-5 on Feb. 15 led to some record show payoffs, will try to make
amends in today's ninth race.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of two of four for Mark Hennig, she will race on Lasix
for the first time in the seven-furlong contest.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Eight sprinters are scheduled to go about 61/2
furlongs on the turf in today's seventh at Santa Anita. Romanzo,
impressive in his debut on the course last month, is the 5-2 morning
line choice.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Muschi. A loser of 32 of her first 34 starts, the
7-year-old Mark Chip mare has won two of her last three and has
definitely improved since joining trainer Bill Morey's barn. She is a
contender in today's fourth at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Those who bet to show on Love At Noon in Wednesday's
seventh at Santa Anita. The 2-5 favorite in the field of five
finished fourth and led to some inflated payoffs on the first three
finishers.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Benderosa in the
second; using Meteor Game, Cow In Solana and Nice Fish in the third,
and Rock The Stone and Burma Red in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/147. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $15.80/$869.40. Total money bet: $890.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Gets Unlikely Boost</HD>
<DH>Big West: Sophomore center Parada shakes off struggles in a
72-65 victory over Long Beach.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adam Parada, UC Irvine's 7-foot sophomore center, was fully aware of
his short career against Long Beach State. The numbers were bad.
Twenty-four points in four games. Break it down further and it's 12,
zero, six and six.</LD>
<LD>   Parada did something about it Thursday night in the first round of
the Big West Conference tournament, finishing with 17 points and 12
rebounds in the Anteaters' hard-fought 72-65 victory over the 49ers.
It wasn't just about the numbers, either. Parada played big and
played with aggression.</LD>
<LD>   "He really looked like a big man in the lane as far as blocking
shots and getting key rebounds," Anteater Coach Pat Douglass said.</LD>
<TE>   Parada also made a key shot down the stretch. With 43.9 seconds
remaining and the Anteaters ahead, 66-63, he sank a skyhook to push
the lead to five.</TE>
<TE>   Parada, a former Alta Loma High standout, made seven of 14 shots
and gave Irvine (21-9) a lift it didn't have in last week's 86-70
loss to the 49ers to end the regular season. In that game, he missed
six of eight shots and scored only six points.</TE>
<TE>   "Staying out of foul trouble was the key for me," Parada said. "I
wanted to do that. I needed to come out hard with full force and let
the game come to me."</TE>
<TE>   Travis Reed missed two foul shots with 27.6 seconds left to
effectively end the 49ers' run. Irvine closed the game with four free
throws and advanced to tonight's semifinal against the UC Santa
Barbara-Cal Poly San Luis Obispo winner.</TE>
<TE>   The loss also ended Wayne Morgan's six-year run as coach. He
announced his resignation Feb. 8 and the move seemed to inspire his
team. Long Beach (13-17) had won a season-high five in a row and was
thought to be the most dangerous team in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime it's the end of the season and you lose your last game,
it's sad," Morgan said. "So I guess we're all sad. Obviously, that's
the last game I'll coach at Long Beach, so it's a little bit sadder."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Green led Irvine with a game-high 23 points. Jordan Harris
added 15 and Stanislav Zuzak added 10.</TE>
<TE>   Green said their intensity was apparent throughout the game. A
week after letting the 49ers shoot 54% and getting outrebounded by
four, the Anteaters limited them to 41% and won the rebounding battle
by three.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the big time, this is when you dive for loose balls,"
Green said. "The intensity has been great. I have never seen it like
this all year."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine made it a point to get Parada going early. He got his first
basket with a follow shot off a Green miss. From there, he operated
effectively inside with either turnaround jump shots or jump hooks in
the lane.</TE>
<TE>   "Those shots he missed in the game before, he made today," Reed
said.</TE>
<TE>   Reed, who dominated Parada in the two regular-season meetings, had
13 points and 10 rebounds while being swarmed by Anteater defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "Adam did a good job denying the ball to Reed and we also had
weak-side help," Douglass said. "Any time he got the ball, we had
four guys around him, so he was smothered."</TE>
<TE>   That kept Long Beach's offensive game on the perimeter. The 49ers
took 25 three-point attempts, 17 in the first half. They made nine.
Tony Darden kept the 49ers close with five three-pointers and 22
points.</TE>

<HD>Just for Variety, Heinze Sits Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Coach Andy Murray didn't take long to make his first decision after
rejoining the Kings: Steve Heinze, take a seat.</LD>
<LD>   Heinze is tied for third on the team with 15 goals, but after
going 17 games since scoring his last on Jan. 15, the winger was
scratched from the lineup for Thursday's game against Nashville,
sitting out for the first time this season.</LD>
<LD>   "We're just trying to see if we can create a little more
productivity," said Murray, who inserted Nelson Emerson into Heinze's
spot on the No. 2 line. "I think he's trying so hard that he's
pressing a little bit, and sometimes you take a mental break from it
and you come back the next game and you're maybe a little more
refreshed or whatever....</LD>
<TE>   "I don't question Steve Heinze's heart or his work ethic. We're
just giving him a break."</TE>
<TE>   Heinze, signed as a free agent last summer to a three-year,
$6-million contract after former King Luc Robitaille signed with the
Detroit Red Wings, has scored two goals in his last 24 games. He
scored a career-high 27 last season with Columbus and Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have been much better on the road than at home, having
lost only four games in regulation outside Staples Center since
October, but that doesn't make them any less determined in their
effort to secure home-ice advantage for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "You always want home ice in the playoffs," said assistant coach
Dave Tippett. "If you get home ice in the playoffs, that means that
you've earned that right by being higher in the standings. You always
want to shoot for that."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, 15-4-4-2 on the road since the end of October, have not
had home-ice advantage in a series since 1992, when they lost a
first-round series in six games to Edmonton. They've had home-ice
advantage in a best-of-seven series only five times, winning two.</TE>

<HD>Kings' Victory Is No Accident</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Murray's return three weeks after crash is  a
success as top line sparks 3-2 win over Nashville.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Andy Murray was happy to be back at work, happy to be back in the
playoff hunt and, perhaps most of all, happy to be able to call on
the line of Ziggy Palffy, Jason Allison and Adam Deadmarsh at crunch
time.</LD>
<LD>   Palffy scored two power-play goals, Deadmarsh scored the winning
goal with 13 seconds to play and Allison assisted on all three
Thursday night as the Kings defeated the Nashville Predators, 3-2, in
their coach's first game back with the team since his single-vehicle
accident last month in Wisconsin.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt pretty good," Murray said, looking a bit drained in the
aftermath but otherwise none the worse for wear. "I told the guys
before the game that if I called out any strange names, just
disregard them.</LD>
<TE>   "They helped me out a lot, played real hard."</TE>
<TE>   Until the final frantic moments, however, it seemed that all the
Kings might take out of the Gaylord Entertainment Center was a sloppy
tie or, worse yet, an overtime loss after squandering a two-goal
third-period lead.</TE>
<TE>   In the blink of an eye, though, Deadmarsh, Allison and Palffy
combined forces to help the Kings end their three-game winless streak
in front of 15,533.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy, whose two goals pushed his team-leading total to 24 and
gave him 10 in the Kings' last nine games, started the game-winning
sequence when he lifted a backhanded shot off the side of the
Predator net.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, swooping in from behind the net, took the rebound and
passed through the crease to a charging Deadmarsh, who scored his
23rd goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have much time," Allison said. "I thought Deady was
going to the net. I just tried to get it there, whether it was off
the goalie or off someone else--just try to get it there so he could
try to get a piece of it or bang it in.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fortunate that it got through to him and he buried it."</TE>
<TE>   The combined eight points for Allison, Deadmarsh and Palffy gave
them 27 in six games since the Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   "Those three guys make each other look better," defenseman Mathieu
Schneider said. "They're fun to play with and they're fun to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Murray surely must think so.</TE>
<TE>   The coach was back behind the bench after missing five games while
recuperating at home in Faribault, Minn., from injuries suffered in a
Feb. 15 accident outside Sparta, Wis., including a concussion, four
broken ribs, a broken and separated left shoulder and numerous cuts
and scrapes.</TE>
<TE>   While assistant Dave Tippett filled in as interim coach, Murray's
return was twice delayed because the coach experienced symptoms of
post-concussion syndrome, among them severe headaches, dizziness and
vomiting. Only last Saturday, Murray said that doctors had told him
it could be several more weeks before he felt well enough to resume
his coaching duties.</TE>
<TE>   By Wednesday, however, his symptoms had subsided. Doctors at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., cleared him to go back to work and
Murray, growing antsy at home and eager to rejoin his team, flew into
Nashville on Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctors tell me, and it's the same with our guys, you can be
in that post-concussion syndrome ... and as soon as your symptoms are
gone, you're OK," Murray said before the game. "If I was a player,
I'm sure I wouldn't be playing, but nobody's going to hit me or check
me or anything like that....</TE>
<TE>   "The way I feel right now, I can do everything that I want to do."</TE>
<TE>   He only had to smile at his good fortune when the Kings were given
a five-on-three opportunity late in the first period, simultaneous
penalties having been called on the Predators' Scott Hartnell and
Greg Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy took advantage, slapping a pass from Allison past
goaltender Mike Dunham to give the Kings a 1-0 lead with 26 seconds
to play in the period.</TE>
<TE>   With 4:05 to play in the second period and the Predators' Cliff
Ronning in the penalty box for slashing, Palffy and Allison teamed up
again. Palffy, from the left circle, shoveled the puck to Allison
behind the net and took off toward the crease, got a return pass from
Allison and slipped the puck into the net.</TE>
<TE>   The Predators tied the score in the third period, Ronning scoring
on a slap shot with 14:04 to play and Tom Fitzgerald on a redirection
with 10:55 left.</TE>
<TE>   "They could have made it a little less exciting the first game
back," Murray said.</TE>

<LD>The key to the Lakers winning NBA titles back to back to back could
prove to be their ability to win games back to back.</LD>
<LD>   In the race for the best record in the Western Conference and
postseason home-court advantage, the Lakers were tied with the Dallas
Mavericks, half a game behind the Sacramento Kings, heading into
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers have 22 games left, five of those preceded by a game
the day before.</LD>
<TE>   That is a problem. The Lakers have faltered this season in the
second of back-to-back games. Wednesday's night's loss to the Jazz in
Utah, after a game against the New Jersey Nets at Staples Center the
night before, left the Lakers 6-8 in those second games.</TE>
<TE>   Playing at a higher altitude, the Lakers showed their fatigue
Wednesday in the second half. Kobe Bryant got the unwanted spotlight
by going 0 for 9 from the field in the final two quarters after
making seven of 10 in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   His difficulties were a microcosm of a team fade. After shooting
50% in the first half, the Lakers shot only 35.9% in the last 24
minutes. And those season-high 24 turnovers didn't help.</TE>
<TE>   Still remaining on the grueling back-to-back schedule are the
Clippers preceded by a game in Oakland, the Spurs in San Antonio
after a game in Dallas, the Suns in Phoenix preceded by Cleveland at
Staples Center, the Nets in New Jersey preceded by a game in
Washington, and the SuperSonics at Staples Center after a game in
Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe fatigue was a factor," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said of
Wednesday's loss. "They [the Jazz] set an incredible pace at which we
had to play basketball."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are already taking orders for their third annual summer
camp.</TE>
<TE>   There will be two sessions for boys ages 9-18 at UC Santa Barbara,
July 7-11 and July 12-16. Cost is $375-$520. Call 310-426-6055 or
e-mail camps@la-lakers.com.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers don't play until Sunday, when they play host to the New
York Knicks at Staples Center.</TE>

<HD>Pook Quickly Puts His Stamp on CART</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenny Brack left team owner Bobby Rahal for Chip Ganassi, and
legendary owner Roger Penske and sponsor Marlboro left Championship
Auto Racing Teams for the Indy Racing League, but the biggest
off-season move for CART was Chris Pook's. He left the Long Beach
Grand Prix Assn., and became the sanctioning body's president and
chief executive officer.</LD>
<LD>   When the CART season begins today in Mexico with provisional
qualifying for Sunday's Tecate Telmex Monterrey Grand Prix, Pook's
fingerprints will be all over.</LD>
<LD>   In his three months of leadership, he has delivered a new
competition formula for 2003-2006, saved the race in Chicago, added a
race in Miami and set down rules for this season that should increase
interest for a full three-day weekend, instead of only Saturday and
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody seems to like the way Chris is directing things," said
Cristiano da Matta, who won last year's season opener at Fundidora
Park, as well as the last two races of the season at Surfer's
Paradise and Fontana--the latter under a yellow-flag finish.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very exciting for me and I'm sure I speak on behalf of the
other drivers, it's very exciting for everybody to see that the
credibility of the series has grown so [much] higher than where we
stopped last season."</TE>
<TE>   Among the on-track changes:</TE>
<TE>   * The use of traction control.</TE>
<TE>   * The return of Friday qualifying for road races, with Friday's
provisional pole winner getting a championship point and a guaranteed
spot in the front row.</TE>
<TE>   * All cars will qualify in one group, instead of two, which were
typically a fast group and a slower one.</TE>
<TE>   * Borrowing from Winston Cup procedure, CART has committed to
red-flag stoppages for late-race incidents to try to eliminate
yellow-flag finishes. Extended full-course caution flag periods will
be minimized and local yellows will be used whenever possible.</TE>
<TE>   * Teams must pit during specified pit windows, which should ensure
more flat-out racing, not fuel-saving economy runs.</TE>
<TE>   "I like what CART is doing, that they are trying different
things," Dario Franchitti said. "It shows that they are thinking
about making the series better and trying to make progress."</TE>
<TE>   Brack likes the changes too."It's going to be more difficult for a
back-marker team to luck out with pit strategy," he said. "If you're
doing a good qualifying effort and you have a good car, the race
result should reflect that. In the previous years, you can
sometimes--by pure luck--basically get the race win. We saw that
several times last year."</TE>
<TE>   There have been business changes as well. CART announced this week
that it will lease Chicago Motor Speedway's one-mile oval and promote
the fourth Grand Prix of Chicago, the first time it has promoted an
existing event. The race originally was among events canceled when
track principals suspended the track's 2002 schedule because of
operating costs.</TE>
<TE>   CART has also announced the addition of the Grand Prix of the
Americas, Oct. 4-6, to be run in conjunction with the American LeMans
series in downtown Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "I can honestly say that six months ago, I worried considerably
about the future [of CART]," said Rahal, who has given Pook the
thumbs up.With Penske and his drivers, two-time champion Gil de
Ferran and fourth-place finisher Helio Castroneves, gone, Brack,
Michael Andretti, da Matta, Max Papis and Franchitti are the
highest-finishing returning drivers. Brack and Papis, teammates last
season with Rahal, are with new teams, as are Oriol Servia and Michel
Jordain Jr. California native Townsend Bell and Mexican driver Mario
Dominguez have been added, Mauricio Gugelmin retired, and Roberto
Moreno and Bryan Herta are without CART rides this season.</TE>
<TE>   A longshot who might be worth watching? Scott Dixon, who finished
eighth last season in his rookie year.</TE>
<TE>   And who could be champion?</TE>
<TE>   "So far, [da Matta] looks good and the Players cars [of Alex
Tagliani and Patrick Carpentier] look strong," said Adrian Fernandez,
one of three Mexican drivers in Monterrey this weekend. "So far, they
have the speed, but it's a matter of them having consistency. But
that's testing. You never know what will happen when everyone gets
together."</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing League</TE>
<TE>   In his first oval race, IRL rookie Tomas Scheckter--son of 1979
Formula One champion Jody Scheckter--finished sixth in the Grand Prix
of Miami at Homestead-Miami Speedway. That would have been fine if he
hadn't run his boss, owner-driver Eddie Cheever, into the wall after
only two laps.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about this until I was blue in the face. 'Take your
time,' we said to him," Cheever recalled. "I would be just as angry
right now if he had done that to somebody else, but to do it to your
teammate, that's just asinine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Penske found his first IRL rival in front of him. Defending
champion Sam Hornish and Panther Racing dominated the race, lapping
everyone but Penske drivers de Ferran and Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   "The Miami race clearly demonstrates the level of competition in
the Indy Racing League," Penske said. "We're taking it step by step
so that we're there at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Grand Am Series</TE>
<TE>   When Dale Earnhardt died Feb. 18, 2001 at the Daytona 500, NASCAR
put the famed No. 3 Chevrolet into storage and it was weeks before
law enforcement agencies had a chance to examine it.</TE>
<TE>   According to Detective Juan del Castillo of the Miami-Dade Police
Department, the car Grand American sports car driver Jeff Clinton,
38, was driving when he was killed during practice March 1 at
Miami-Homestead Speedway was examined by traffic homicide
investigators that day and later released.</TE>
<TE>   Off-Road</TE>
<TE>   Dan Smith and David Ashley, both of Riverside and driving in the
featured Trophy Truck division, won their fifth consecutive desert
race, the 16th Tecate SCORE San Felipe 250, finishing the 227.7-mile
course in 3 hours 45 minutes 7 seconds in their Ford F-150.</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to win the race for the fourth consecutive time, Ed and
Tim Herbst of Las Vegas finished fifth after encountering electrical
problems and flipping their Ford five miles from the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Funny Car driver Del Worsham and his wife, Connie, became parents

<HD>Mavericks Showing They're Big Winners</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dallas Mavericks' Big Three strutted their stuff against a fading
team that hasn't won in a month.</LD>
<LD>   Dirk Nowitzki made long shots and dunks to score 35 points,
Michael Finley soared over and around Vince Carter for 25 and Steve
Nash combined 19 points with a season-best 15 assists, carrying
Dallas past the hapless Toronto Raptors, 122-103, Thursday night at
Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   The bonus prize for the Mavericks was becoming the first team in
the NBA with 43 victories. For Toronto, the loss was their 13th
consecutive, prompting a closed-door meeting after the game.</LD>
<TE>   "We're on the verge of something good," Finley said. "Right now,
we can't look at the standings and hope other teams lose. If we keep
winning, I like our position."</TE>
<TE>   At 43-18, Dallas is in a virtual tie with Sacramento for the best
record in the NBA. The Kings (42-17) have a slightly better winning
percentage, .712 to .705.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors are within two games of the longest losing streak by
any team this season. Two after that and they'll tie the worst skid
in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new experience--I've never been in that position before,"
said Toronto Coach Lenny Wilkens, the winningest coach in NBA
history. "I'm sure they want to win so bad. They know that there's
two or three games that got away from us and had they not, the streak
doesn't exist."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 95, Washington 92--Jon Barry made a three-pointer from the
left corner at the buzzer to give the Pistons a victory at
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Barry, wide open in the corner, took the pass from Damon Jones,
rattled in the shot and mouthed "Go home, go home" to the crowd as
the Pistons celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   Corliss Williamson scored 23 points and Jerry Stackhouse had 19
for the Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 122, Indiana 111--Jason Williams, playing his first game
since Feb. 19, scored 33 points and handed out 11 assists as the
Grizzlies won at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Grizzlies finished in double figures as Memphis snapped an
eight-game losing streak and set a franchise record for points scored
in regulation. The victory was the first over Indiana in franchise
history after 13 losses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 99, Houston 97--Tim Duncan had a double-double by
halftime and finished with 30 points and 16 rebounds at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Spur rookie Tony Parker had 16 points and a career-high 10
rebounds. Malik Rose added 14 points and David Robinson grabbed 12
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver 104, New York 93--Juwan Howard had 30 points, seven
rebounds and nine assists for the Nuggets, who shot 55% after making
less than 40% of their shots in six of their previous nine games.</TE>
<TE>   New York has lost eight of 10 overall and six consecutive on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 92, Charlotte 89--Shammond Williams scored five points in
the last 40 seconds of overtime at Seattle after Desmond Mason tied
the game on a soaring left-handed dunk off a missed three-pointer by
Gary Payton as time expired in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey guard Jason Kidd was fined $5,000 by the league for
making an obscene gesture toward fans Wednesday night in the Nets'
loss to Phoenix. The former Sun star was playing in Phoenix for the
first time since being traded to New Jersey during the off-season.</TE>

<KH>PACIFIC 10 TOURNAMENT AT STAPLES CENTER</KH>
<HD>USC Outclasses Stanford</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Clancy leads way as Trojans make it a
clean sweep of Cardinal with 103-78 romp. Oregon is up next tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least Stanford missed only one day of school.</LD>
<LD>   After complaining long and hard about the academic consequences of
holding a league tournament, and delaying the team's departure from
its Palo Alto campus to get in a full day of classes, the Cardinal
was taught a different kind of lesson Thursday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   With Staples Center serving as the classroom and USC acting as the
strict instructor, the Trojans ended Stanford's stay in the
resurrected Pacific 10 Conference tournament with a 103-78 thrashing
in a first-round game.</LD>
<TE>   In pulling off a three-game sweep of Stanford, the 22nd-ranked
Trojans earned a rematch against regular-season champion Oregon in a
semifinal at 6 tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Having lost to Oregon twice this season by a total of six points,
the Trojans reached the semifinals by getting a boost from their
bench to go along with solid senior play in what was their
highest-scoring outing of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody showed up today," USC Coach Henry Bibby said. "We need
more than one, one-and-a-half people to show up, and they all showed
up.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said that the most important people on the team are the
bench. When they come in and get involved, it makes things that much
easier."</TE>
<TE>   Five Trojans scored in double figures for the sixth time this
season, the third time against Stanford, and USC (21-8) improved to
6-0 in such games.</TE>
<TE>   Senior forward Sam Clancy, the newly crowned Pac-10 player of the
year, solidified his selection by going for a game-high 25 points and
nine rebounds while getting three blocks and two steals.</TE>
<TE>   Senior point guard Brandon Granville had his fifth double-double
of the season with 20 points and 11 assists, and senior small forward
David Bluthenthal had 17 points while making four of six three-point
shots.</TE>
<TE>   Desmon Farmer and Jerry Dupree, two excitable role players who
have felt Bibby's wrath for lack of focus in recent weeks, provided
the spark off the bench. Farmer finished with 19 points and two
steals in 28 minutes, and Dupree had 10 points and two assists in 16
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Jerry try to bring the energy," Farmer said. "From our
facial expressions to how we play on the court. We just want to get
everybody involved."</TE>
<TE>   Dupree, a junior college transfer who started the Trojans' first
three games of the season before being lost in the shuffle and
relegated to substitute duty, agreed, saying he was close to checking
out mentally on the Trojans in midseason.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about high energy," he said, "getting the crowd into it.
When we play like that, the whole team plays as one."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were playing as one midway through the first half, and
the game was comfortably in hand by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   With Stanford (19-9) holding a 12-9 lead, USC went to a
three-guard lineup of Farmer, Granville and freshman Errick Craven,
with Bluthenthal and Clancy up front.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, having been stymied by trying to play a half-court
game with the bigger and more methodical Cardinal, also started
showing various versions of their full-court press.</TE>
<TE>   Although it didn't create the rash of turnovers it had in the
teams' two previous meetings, the press did speed up the tempo into
USC's favor.</TE>
<TE>   With the smaller lineup on the floor, the Trojans went on an 11-2
run to grab a 20-14 lead. USC then embarked on a 28-11 run over a
nearly nine-minute span to go up by a first half-high 23 points,
48-25, with three minutes remaining in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the run were three Bluthenthal three-pointers in less
than 21/2 minutes and an alley-oop dunk by Dupree in which the small
forward seemed to come down from the Staples Center rafters.</TE>
<TE>   USC shot 66.7% from the field in the first half, 63.6% (seven of
11) from beyond the three-point arc, while limiting the Cardinal to
38.2% and one for eight on three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   "We were quicker than them and made a lot of 'sick' plays, as the
coaches call them," Bluthenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just had more energy than they did."</TE>
<TE>   With USC getting only one field goal in a span of 7:25 in the
second half, Stanford crept within 14 points, 65-51, with just over
12 minutes remaining. Then USC took off again, gaining a game-high
32-point lead, 98-66, with 3:46 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "They came out and were much more aggressive and just stepped up
and made shots," said Stanford center Curtis Borchardt, who had 17
points. "They were everywhere, on offense and defense. They just flat
out kicked our butts. They were just flat out better."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like a lesson learned.</TE>

<LD>Pete Sampras faced a double whammy--his history at the Franklin
Templeton Tennis Classic and his record against Wayne Ferreira--that
he couldn't overcome Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Ferreira beat the 13-time Grand Slam champion, who has never
advanced past the second round at Scottsdale, Ariz., 7-5, 7-5.</LD>
<LD>   The South African's sixth win over Sampras in 12 meetings put him
into a quarterfinal against No. 7 Xavier Malisse today.</LD>

1998 and '99, withdrew because of an injury in 2000 and lost in the
first round to Andrew Ilie in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The upset deprived the tournament of a possible match between
Sampras and Andre Agassi, who plays Juan Ignacio Chela today.</TE>
<TE>   Malisse beat Andrea Gaudenzi, taking, 7-5, 7-6 (6). In other
matches, Rainer Schuettler beat Felix Mantilla, 6-0, 2-6, 6-1, and

<LD>Ladislav Nagy won't complain about being a crossbar away from his
first hat trick.</LD>
<LD>   Nagy scored twice in the second period and Teppo Numminen had four
assists to lead the Phoenix Coyotes past the Vancouver Canucks, 6-1,
on Thursday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm happy I scored two goals and the team won," Nagy said. "The
first 15 games I didn't play really well. But right now I have a lot
of confidence."</LD>
<TE>   Nagy rang a shot off the crossbar in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix is 5-0-1-1 in its last seven games and has trailed only
once in five games since the end of the Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting leads is big in this league," said Mike Johnson, who
scored a short-handed goal in the second period. "It's something
we've focused on the whole year. But it's a matter of us getting the
goals now."</TE>
<TE>   Shane Doan, Branko Radivojevic and Landon Wilson also scored for
the Coyotes, who pulled even with idle Dallas for seventh place in
the Western Conference with 71 points, two points behind the Kings
and St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Bertuzzi scored for the Canucks, who are winless in five of
their last six games (1-2-1-2) and trail the Stars and Coyotes by
four points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 5, Ottawa 2--Marco Sturm had a goal and two assists, and
Teemu Selanne scored his 400th goal as the Sharks ended a three-game
losing streak with a victory at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose pounded Ottawa goalie Patrick Lalime for five goals in
the second period--four in a furious 5:45 span--and breezed past the
Senators, who had just one regulation loss in their previous 15
games. The scoring flurry was a remarkable change for the Sharks, who
were shut out by Nashville on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 4, Philadelphia 2--Dean McAmmond scored the go-ahead goal
in the second period at Philadelphia, lifting the Flames to a
victory.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Flames' first victory in Philadelphia since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Jarome Iginla, who scored a power-play empty-net goal with 47
seconds remaining, also had an assist to increase his league-leading
totals to 41 goals and a career-high 76 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 5, New York Islanders 0--Martin Biron stopped 26 shots for
his second shutout of the season, and Eric Rasmussen scored twice as
the Sabres won at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Gratton, J.P. Dumont and Stu Barnes each had a power-play
goal for Buffalo. It was the Sabres' first win on the road since a
3-2 overtime victory at Washington on Jan. 27.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 3, Pittsburgh 1--Ron Francis scored twice in the third
period at Pittsburgh as the Hurricanes defeated the Penguins for
their fourth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Sami Kapanen assisted on all three Carolina goals and Jeff O'Neill
also scored.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 3, St. Louis 0--Marian Gaborik scored twice and
goaltender Dwayne Roloson stopped 28 shots to lead the Wild at St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The win also was the first for Minnesota against St. Louis. The
Wild had been 0-4-2 against the Blues.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, New York Rangers 1--Eric Daze and Michael Nylander each
had a goal and two assists as the Blackhawks won at Chicago.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Improvement Is a Matter of Degrees</HD>
<DH>First round: Top-seeded Ducks make up a big deficit in a
hurry and pull away from Washington, 86-64.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Frederick Jones had a fever.</LD>
<LD>   Then the whole Oregon team got hot.</LD>
<LD>   Fourteen minutes into the revival of the Pacific 10 tournament
Thursday, top-seeded Oregon trailed Washington by 13 points.</LD>
<TE>   Visions of an upset danced in the heads of other teams' fans.</TE>
<TE>   Then ninth-ranked Oregon kicked its running game into gear in the
second half and scored on a shower of three-point baskets to pull
away for an 86-64 victory, advancing to a semifinal game against USC
tonight at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, Jones hadn't managed anything but two free throws,
Oregon didn't have a single fastbreak bucket, and Washington led by
seven.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until after the game that most people who hadn't sat on
the Oregon bench found out how ill Jones was.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a 102 temperature before tipoff, then by the time the game
started it had dropped to 99," Oregon Coach Ernie Kent said. "He
needed the first half to get it out of his system. We didn't even
know if he was going to play before the game."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Luke Jackson became Oregon's big gun, scoring 27 points
and going four for eight from three-point range, four for four in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   Jones finished with 15, two on the steal and breakaway slam dunk
that gave Oregon its first lead since the early going, 47-45, six
minutes into the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the half, Oregon led by 10 after Jones had
completed a three-point play, throwing a head-and-shoulders fake and
leaning in to make the shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as long as I'm ready for game time," Jones said. "I can be
sick at any other time, but at game time I need to be ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon (23-7) was ready in the second half, especially after a
12-minute delay because of a shot-clock malfunction early in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   After the problem was solved, Jackson and Jones knocked down
three-pointers in quick succession and Oregon cut the lead to one.</TE>
<TE>   Any chance Washington (11-18) had of upsetting Oregon for a second
time this season seemed to slip away during the delay.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Coach Bob Bender said. "Both teams had to deal
with it. Our energy was not the same coming out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Wrenn carried Washington early, scoring 12 of his 14 points
in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   But Oregon--still weary from its pressure-packed sweep of USC and
UCLA to win the Pac-10 regular-season title last week--finally picked
up its defense.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Washington Athletic Director Barbara Hedges
reiterated her policy of reviewing coaches' performance after the
season and said she has been supportive of Bender. Since reaching the
Sweet 16 in 1998 and returning to the NCAA tournament in 1999, he has
had three losing seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, after dodging a potential upset, will face the Trojans, a
team it beat twice in the final minute this season, winning by four
points in Eugene and by two at the Sports Arena last week on Jones'
shot with one second left.</TE>
<TE>   "USC for us, we've liked the matchup," Kent said. "The way they
press, the way they play in the half-court and trap you, they force
you to spread the floor and use your skill. We just feel like we're a
pretty skilled basketball team that can shoot it. We still feel like
we haven't given them a great shooting game yet. It's going to be a
tough battle."</TE>

<LD>One of the finest young anglers to set foot on a fishing boat has
soft, brown eyes and a shy smile. She is Daniela Mercado, a
fourth-grader at Cahuenga Elementary School near downtown Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   She and her classmates spent Tuesday morning aboard Redondo
Sportfishing's Redondo Special as guests of the 976-TUNA youth
fishing program, which introduces inner-city children to a form of
recreation they might otherwise not have the opportunity to try.</LD>
<LD>   Mercado not only caught the first fish, a keeper-size Johnny bass
she steadfastly refused to touch, but also reeled in the most fish,
four, one a brilliant vermilion rockfish.</LD>
<TE>   A natural? You bet. But what makes Mercado such a fine young
angler is an attitude as refreshing as the breeze washing gently over
the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   She never boasted, never complained, never pushed or shoved. She
smiled, with each tug of the line, enjoying her day in the sun,
wanting no part of the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, hers was an attitude shared by her classmates, fine young
anglers themselves, whether they caught fish or not.</TE>
<TE>   Being first-timers, they soaked up the sights and sounds others
take for granted. The long, comical faces of pelicans made them
laugh. The resonant barking of sea lions made them take notice. The
distant, flat horizon, and the incredible vastness that lies between,
made them wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the shimmering blue ocean never held such allure.</TE>
<TE>   "If I catch a shark and reel it to the boat, I think I'm just
going to throw my fishing pole over," declared Omar Lopez, a
fifth-grader, as the structures on shore became smaller and smaller.</TE>
<TE>   The mere mention of a shark wiped away the smiles of everyone
within earshot, but only briefly, as their focus soon shifted to
matters at hand.</TE>
<TE>   They marveled at the sea lions piled atop one another on the base
of a large buoy, as Capt. Jeff Jessop held a westerly course toward a
spot at the outer reaches of Santa Monica Bay.</TE>
<TE>   They poked their hands into the bait tanks, pulled out anchovies
and tried their best to hold onto the slithering fish they would soon
be using as bait.</TE>
<TE>   Some handled the excursion better than others. A few were
gripped by fears they could not shake, and one quivering, tearful young
angler seemed certain that his first voyage would also be his last.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the adults came in. Representatives from L.A.'s Best,
an after-school enrichment, education and recreation program, were on
board to offer support and reassurance. The 976-TUNA staff and
Jessop's crew were there to bait hooks, untangle lines and do what
they could to ensure that everyone had a good time.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't so daunting a task.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first told them about it, last Friday, there was a
deafening roar in the classroom," said Justin Puhl, a teacher whose
fourth-grade class took up most of the deck. "They were cheering and
pounding their desks and everything."</TE>
<TE>   At the fishing grounds, the children learned their first valuable
lesson: Fishing is called fishing, not catching.</TE>
<TE>   But after a dreadfully slow start, the fish did start biting.
Mercado reeled from the depths her 14-inch bass. Danny Cruz bagged a
mackerel, and Mabellin Barrios decked a small flounder. Mercado then
hoisted high over the deck her vermilion rockfish, its bright red
body glistening in the sun.</TE>
<TE>   They were reluctant to pose with their catches. Not so Jesus
Flores, a third-grader. But first, there was the matter of holding
onto a slippery mackerel, which was not easy. Flores soon found,
however, that the mouth of the mackerel wasn't slippery, so in his
thumb went--and out it shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It bited me, but it only hurt a little bit," the intrepid angler
explained. "So now I want to catch a bigger one, like a shark or a
swordfish."</TE>
<TE>   The action was now as brisk as the strengthening wind, but along
came a choice that presented itself in the form of a cardboard box
full of steaming hot dogs, brought out by crew member Kathleen
Delany.</TE>
<TE>   To fish or to feast? That was a question to which there was no
easy answer.</TE>
<TE>   Nayeli Mendiola found that the best solution was to do both. She
held a hot dog in one hand, rod in the other, and when a mackerel
took her bait she simply stuffed the hot dog in her mouth and reeled
in her quarry.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how the fight went, she answered in a word: "Shaky."</TE>
<TE>   "Shaky," "shivery," "sleepy" and even "queasy" were all
appropriate words by the time Jessop gave the call to "reel 'em in."</TE>
<TE>   He was satisfied with this new crop of anglers he helped break in.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be out here on their own five years from now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Lopez wasn't so sure about that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm cold and I have all these scales in my hair," the
third-grader quipped. "I need to go home and take a bath."</TE>

<HD>Sanctuary Proposal Under Fire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a gathering of enthusiastic anglers as a backdrop, sportfishing
leaders fired their latest salvo Thursday at those supporting the
proposed closing of large portions of the Channel Islands National
Marine Sanctuary to fishing.</LD>
<LD>   The American Sportfishing Assn. and United Anglers of Southern
California charged, as doors were opening for the second day of the
Fred Hall Fishing Tackle and Boat Show in Long Beach, that state and
federal officials have "dramatically underestimated" the economic
impact of such closures.</LD>
<LD>   The charge was backed by an independent study that cites potential
losses of $100 million or more annually, and the loss of 2,700 jobs
under the most restrictive of options being considered by the
California Fish and Game Commission, which will rule on the issue in
August.</LD>
<TE>   Potential losses projected last year by a CINMS panel were pegged
at $17.7 million and 487 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed regulations include six alternative "Marine Protected
Area" networks involving 12% to 34% of sanctuary waters; an
alternative for no change to the existing system, and an alternative
to include the Channel Islands marine reserves process as part of a
coast-wide process that won't be determined until 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Fish and Game and the CINMS manager are backing
an alternative that would close 25% of sanctuary waters. Sportfishing
interests favor including this issue in the coast-wide process, which
will involve more input from affected parties or individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The latest study, conducted by Southwick Associates in Fernandina
Beach, Fla., found the CINMS panel's evaluation to have "used old
angler data and flawed methodology that did not include equipment
such as tackle and boats--items that are the majority of anglers'
purchases."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Wiley, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
economist who was on the panel, declined to comment on specifics but
took exception to claims that the panel's findings were flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "We derived a portion of our expenditure profiles from older
studies," Wiley said, "but most were from the 1990s [and] our
expenditure profiles for fishermen did include equipment costs."</TE>
<TE>   Those involved, for example, expenditures of $22.22 per person per
day for charter- or party-boat trips; and $38.63 per person per day
for private boat fishing trips.</TE>
<TE>   The ASA-UASC report went beyond per-day trip equipment
expenditures and included everything from rods and reels to
binoculars to boats to vacation homes.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, said ASA President Mike Nussman, "They included
everything you will find here at the show."</TE>

<LD>Sam Clancy was going on about how a team that has already beaten
another twice in a season has an intimidation factor working in its
favor.</LD>
<LD>   The USC senior power forward and Pacific 10 Conference player of
the year was referring to the domination the Trojans enjoyed over
Stanford, which they had just thumped, 103-78.</LD>
<LD>   When asked then if Oregon, the Trojans' next opponent, which had
swept them this season by a combined six points, held a similar
psychological advantage over USC, Clancy was quick to change course.</LD>
<TE>   "They stole two [games] from us," he said. "They stole two from us
and we're coming to get one back."</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore reserve forward Jerry Dupree was also looking for a
little payback.</TE>
<TE>   "We owe them big time," he said. "They took two from us and the
Pac-10 title and we can't let them take the tournament from us too."</TE>
<TE>   Desmon Farmer said the Trojans also have an ulterior motive.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel bad because we feel like we cost our coach [Henry Bibby]
the Pac-10 coach of the year [award]," he said, "because we lost
those games to them and lost the title."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stanford's players considered whether the mixed feelings about
playing in the Pac-10 tournament affected the team's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I have to say to that is maybe we don't know how
to approach it mentally yet," guard Tony Giovacchini said. "This is
the first time in the four years of mine that I've played in a
tournament. It was exciting. It was nice. They did a really nice job
of putting it on.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] usually at this point in the season we're ready for
Selection Sunday or we're playing our last Pac-10 game. Maybe there's
a mental adjustment we've got to figure out in terms of, OK, regular
season, postseason."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who is Gregg Guenther Jr. and what was he doing in the USC
starting lineup?</TE>
<TE>   Not much, considering he played three minutes, missed his only
shot, and picked up two fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Guenther is a football player. At 6 feet 8, 250 pounds,
he is a USC tight end who has sat out most of his first two seasons
because of back problems.</TE>
<TE>   But he was also a standout basketball player at Taft High. Needing
muscle, Bibby added him to the basketball team Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has started him three times this year against teams with big
centers, and the Trojans are 2-1 with him in the lineup, so don't
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   In those games, he has taken three shots and missed all three. But
he has also grabbed six rebounds, so that's why Bibby keeps using
him.</TE>
<TE>   Right?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really sure what he does," Bibby said with a smile before
the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC swept Stanford in three games this season by a total of 52
points.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, I felt like everyone sort of wanted to redeem
themselves for losing by 20 at home and losing to them the first
time," guard Julius Barnes said. "It didn't transfer to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely the best I've seen them play. This is probably
the best I've seen any team play."</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual statistic, Stanford outrebounded USC, 51-31.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stanford's loss left the Cardinal with a 19-9 record and a little
nervousness about Selection Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   With a No. 30 RPI rating before Thursday's loss and road victories
over UCLA and Arizona, Stanford should be OK.</TE>
<TE>   The seeding for the Cardinal will suffer, however.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we don't draw USC in the NCAAs, we should be fine,"
Casey Jacobsen said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Paul Gutierrez, Bill Plaschke and Robyn Norwood

<HD>Trojans Assume That Familiar March Look</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Their snoozing of last week complete, their naps of the last four
months finished, USC blinked them open Thursday with the wonder of
newborns.</LD>
<LD>   The eyes of March.</LD>
<LD>   On David Bluthenthal, they shined.</LD>
<TE>   On Brandon Granville, they danced.</TE>
<TE>   On Sam Clancy, they were clear, steady, a picture worth four
words.</TE>
<TE>   Been there. Done that.</TE>
<TE>   USC's 103-78 victory over intimidated Stanford in the first round
of the Pac-10 tournament was not about how the Trojans looked, but
how they looked.</TE>
<TE>   They glared as they did last March in the thriller against Boston
College, the stunner against Kentucky, the stand against Duke.</TE>
<TE>   They looked more than Sweet, better than Elite.</TE>
<TE>   They looked downright Final.</TE>
<TE>   They looked as we thought they would look at the start of this
season, before their stars lined up in Coach Henry Bibby's doghouse,
before buzzer-beaters whipped their confidence, before one last blown
lead killed their conference championship.</TE>
<TE>   We wondered, did the grind of the last four months sap this
potentially special team of too much spirit?</TE>
<TE>   About five minutes into Thursday's game, in front of the sort of
roaring crowd that gave them a standing ovation just for walking from
the stands to the locker room, we wondered no more.</TE>
<TE>   Tied 14-all with an opponent they had beaten twice this year, an
opponent supposedly too savvy to be hat-tricked ... the Trojans
avoided the Stanford brains by putting it in their face.</TE>
<TE>   Desmon Farmer through the middle of the defense for a layup.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer through the middle for another layup.</TE>
<TE>   Granville through the middle for another layup after a goaltending
call.</TE>
<TE>   The score now 20-14, the Trojans then backed up and killed the
Cardinal softly.</TE>
<TE>   Granville soaring three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy fadeaway jumper.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer lofted three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   It was part of a 23-5 run that turned one of college basketball's
most sophisticated programs into jelly.</TE>
<TE>   "They fell right into our hands," said Farmer.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Trojans must increase their reach. Tonight, in the
tournament semifinals, they play regular-season champion Oregon, a
team that beat them twice this year by a total of six points.</TE>
<TE>   USC intimidated?</TE>
<TE>   Are you nuts?</TE>
<TE>   "They stole two from us this year," barked Clancy. "They stole two
from us this year, and we're going to get one back."</TE>
<TE>   No argument here. Not with a guy who, a day after being named
Pac-10 player of the year, blocked two shots on one possession, made
a leaping-out-of-bounds assist on another possession, and, oh yeah,
scored 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he spoke not with excitement, but with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   Tournaments are survived with such shrugs.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed familiar," Clancy said. "Big arena. Big crowd. The
whole thing was very familiar."</TE>
<TE>   Familiar, times three.</TE>
<TE>   The successful postseason experience that any good March team has
in one player, the Trojans have in triplicate.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, Bluthenthal and Granville--all seniors who have survived
four years with Bibby--combined Thursday for 62 points, 16 rebounds
and 14 assists.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, throw in Farmer, and they probably could have
beaten Stanford while playing shorthanded.</TE>
<TE>   "What surprised me was how the young guys who have not been in
this position acted so familiar," said Clancy.</TE>
<TE>   It only makes sense. Bibby sketched this the way he sketches every
other crazy strategy.</TE>
<TE>   According to his players, Bibby occasionally stops practice, grabs
one of the three seniors, and asks him to tell a campfire story about
this month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all been explained to everyone, what it takes, how it feels,
how we did last year," said Farmer, the excitable sophomore who
scored 19 points while dancing 19 different celebratory steps. "The
young guys have taken it all in. Everybody knows what to expect."</TE>
<TE>   What exactly would that be?</TE>
<TE>   Granville was hoping we'd ask.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get to Atlanta," he said, referring to the site of
this year's Final Four. "I know you don't expect USC to talk like
that, but that's our goal."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but he's wrong. After watching them win for the fourth time in
their last five postseason games, there is nothing that should
surprise us about these Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Not the fact that Bibby's offense so thoroughly outmaneuvered the
defense of Stanford's renowned Mike Montgomery, the Cardinal
eventually resorted to body slams and desperate grabs.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no answer," said Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   Not the fact that Bibby's defense kept Stanford so off balance,
the Cardinal missed 15 of 19 slipping, sliding three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "They just flat out kicked our butts," said center Curtis
Borchardt.</TE>
<TE>   And certainly not the fact that Bibby did all of this while
wearing a funky purple tie that matched his postgame mood when
somebody asked how his team so thoroughly dominated one of the top
programs in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," said Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Of course he knows. But he's not telling. So stop asking. Just
watch.</TE>
<TE>   Watch the Stanford player throwing a ball so far out of bounds,
Clancy and Granville stop, stare at the ball, and laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Watch Bluthenthal shaking his head after hitting one of his four
three-point shots, the same sort of shots that beat Kentucky last
March.</TE>
<TE>   Watch their eyes.</TE>

over The Times' No. 8-ranked team Thursday night in a Loara
tournament semifinal game at Glover Stadium in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   Dana Hills (4-0) advances to play Lakewood in the championship
game at 7 p.m. Saturday at Glover Stadium.</LD>

Lawson, who reached base on an error, stole second, took third on a
passed ball and scored on a groundout by Matt Cooper.</LD>
<TE>   Davidson (1-0) went out and retired 15 consecutive batters. Dana

Adam Blankenbiller, who had walked.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson retired the first batter in the sixth before walking Dane
Ferguson on a full count to end his perfect-game bid.</TE>
<TE>   Four errors by Villa Park (3-1) and a two-run single by Kevin
Fouret added up to four runs in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson lost his no-hitter when Erik Averill laid down a drag
bunt to lead off the bottom half of the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was working for him," Dana Hills Coach Zeke Barragan
said. "He was hitting his spots and he was really focused."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Alai</TE>

<TE>   Saugus 13, Harbor City Narbonne 5--Matt Underwood had two doubles

Saugus, which will play Chatsworth in the division final at 2:30 p.m.
Saturday at Jackie Robinson Stadium. Luke Ajer pitched six innings
for the Centurions, giving up three earned runs.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon Country Canyon 7, Camarillo 6--Clay Britton, who had three
hits, completed a two-out rally in the top of the seventh inning with
a run-scoring single to give Canyon (4-0) a victory over host
Camarillo (3-1) in a Westside tournament Blue division semifinal
game.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon used two walks and three passed balls with two outs to
score the tying run and set up Britton's game-winning hit. Jake Coash
(2-0) pitched 41/3innings in relief to for the victory, although he
gave up a grand slam to Justin Frash in the fifth inning, which
allowed Camarillo to take a 6-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Burke had a home run in the first inning, Justin Schwartz had
a two-run double in the fourth inning and Eric Ashbrook drove in runs
with a single and a groundout for Canyon, which plays Newbury Park in
the division final at 11 a.m. Saturday at Jackie Robinson Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Newbury Park 3, Hawthorne 1--Doug Webb had a two-run home run and
freshman right-hander Andy Kellog (2-0) pitched a six-hitter and
struck out 10 for Newbury Park (4-0) in a Westside tournament Red
division semifinal victory over host Hawthorne (3-1).</TE>

<PH>PACIFIC 10 TOURNAMENT AT STAPLES CENTER</PH>
<KH>Diane Pucin</KH>
<HD>L.A. Gets a Chance to Star</HD>

<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Staples Center was nearly filled with basketball fans at 3 on a
Thursday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon was just finishing up a win over Washington, it was the
middle of a work day and the sounds in the building were the sounds
of March. College bands pounding the drums on opposite sides of an
arena. USC fans warming up their vocal chords for Game 2.</LD>
<LD>   Out front the parking lots were full. A man wearing an Arizona
sweater and another wearing a USC shirt walked five blocks from the
parking garage, best friends they said, graduates of different
schools and having a ball. And their teams hadn't started to play
yet.</LD>
<TE>   In the first year of the rehabbed, reinstated Pac-10 tournament,
Los Angeles has become the best place for college basketball in the
country this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   College basketball has always benefited from showcase events in
the big cities--from the Chicago Stadium doubleheaders to the old
Madison Square Gardens days. Now it's time for L.A. to step to the
head of the line.</TE>
<TE>   Because the tournament is new and a little shiny, because USC and
UCLA bring passion to the place, because Los Angeles is, at heart, a
basketball town. Because who couldn't get into this conference
tournament stuff after watching Gonzaga and Pepperdine go at it
Monday night, non-stop, full-court pressure, individual brilliance,
teams who knew everything about each other playing for everything,
for pride, for fun, for the chance to brag, for the sheer heck of it.</TE>
<TE>   Not to get all warm and fuzzy about this. The tickets were sold
only in weekend packages, too expensive for the common student and if
this is supposed to be about the schools, then the students should be
welcomed. But since Staples was pretty jam-packed Thursday, it seems
unlikely the Pac-10 is going to be offering student discounts next
year.</TE>
<TE>   And the schedule was delayed when there was a shot clock
malfunction in the second half of Game 1. Nearly 30 minutes was lost,
never to be made up. Game 4, between UCLA and Cal, which was supposed
to begin at 9, didn't tip off until 9:35 p.m. If the conference is
hoping to showcase its teams around the country, having games end at
2 a.m. in the East doesn't help and it's not great for fans who might
not have gotten home until well after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   So here's a plea to not mess up a good thing. Check the equipment.
Maybe offer a little goodwill and good discounts to the students.</TE>
<TE>   Because bringing the Pac-10 tournament to Los Angeles has given
the conference and our town some pizazz.</TE>
<TE>   It's new and it's cool and that makes it good.</TE>
<TE>   On a local radio station, during the Oregon-Washington game, the
host was saying that the tournament was a bad idea, that the tickets
were too expensive, that nobody in Los Angeles was going to come out
on a Thursday afternoon and that almost certainly Staples Center was
going to be two-thirds empty.</TE>
<TE>   The host should have attended the event.</TE>
<TE>   Because what hit a person first, upon arrival, in the second half
of the Oregon-Washington game, was the noise. It was fan noise,
fervent noise, high-pitched and intense and involving. It was the
kind of noise you don't usually hear at Staples until the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   This festive environment, where there's a patch of Arizona red, of
Arizona State gold, of USC cardinal and gold, of Oregon green, of
UCLA blue, where fans are seated by affiliation, where the patrons
stand in the lobby dissing each other in the McDonald's line and can
say "We'll get you next year," at the street corner afterward, is a
great addition to the Los Angeles sporting calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe some of the Pac-10 coaches aren't crazy about adding a
conference tournament, facing extra pressure, finding out the alums
might care about who wins the event. But the players love it.</TE>
<TE>   You can tell by how hard the Oregon players went after Washington.
The Ducks won the regular-season championship and are going to be in
the NCAA tournament and it could have been convenient and easy to let
Washington carry on from its big first-half lead to the win. But the
Ducks played hard and well in the second half because it mattered.</TE>
<TE>   In some of these tournaments, it doesn't seem to matter as much
anymore. There used to be fistfights outside Madison Square Garden
between fans before games during the Big East tournament.</TE>
<TE>   All the fans arriving by train and subway right at the Garden,
mingling on 33rd Street, then watching Patrick Ewing or Malik Sealy
or Chris Mullin or Derrick Coleman, it was a happening. Now it's kind
of stale. The Garden is a little tattered, a bit old-fashioned. There
aren't any Patrick Ewings anymore.</TE>
<TE>   They'll tell us the ACC tournament is it, is the thing, is the
only place to be. Tobacco Road and all that. But isn't it just a
little quaint, kind of fuddy-duddy, all that history and people
wearing Carolina blue suit coats and ties? The ACC has lots of
tradition but not enough good teams. Duke and Maryland isn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   And all that stuff they say about L.A., late to arrive, early to
leave? The house was still full for the fourth game of the
quadruple-header. Why? Because there's not a better place to be this
weekend.</TE>

<HD>Seniors Trying to Make These Their Golden Years</HD>
<DH>Golf: Changes to make tour more friendly to fans will be in
use at this weekend's event in Newport Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Senior PGA Tour is getting a makeover this year, one that uses
microphones and television cameras instead of makeup and is intended
to inject the sagging senior tour with a jolt of charisma.</LD>
<LD>   Fan-player interaction is the key to the new-look senior tour,
which visits Newport Beach Country Club today through Sunday for the
Toshiba Senior Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Maria Canizares is the defending champion after winning a
nine-hole playoff over Gil Morgan last year. While such drama is
important in maintaining fan interest, years of steady declines in
television ratings and attendance show that competition alone could
not stop the senior tour from sinking.</LD>
<TE>   Making the tour more fan-friendly was paramount in the changes
unveiled at the start of this season, and players are applauding the
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing is fantastic," said Gary McCord, the 1999
champion at Newport Beach Country Club. "We're taking our tour and
marketing it as something different that will hopefully catch
everybody's attention."</TE>
<TE>   Spectators will be allowed inside the ropes to follow the final
group for the last few holes of the final round. Up to 12 fans per
day will be selected to walk with a group inside the ropes for the
entire round and several players will conduct question-and-answer
sessions with fans after their rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, players will conduct live, on-course television
interviews during play and, eventually, the tour hopes to put
microphones on selected players.</TE>
<TE>   "We're marketing it all warm, cuddly and fuzzy," McCord said. "You
can get close to the guys and we're gonna get guys talking coming
down to the end ... kind of get it a little more personal to the golf
fan."</TE>
<TE>   Popular players such as Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino and Chi Chi
Rodriguez carried the tour during its heyday in the late 1980s and
early '90s, but as those fan favorites have grown older and cut back
on their playing schedules, the tour has evolved from relaxed to
highly competitive. The increased competitiveness has spawned an
anti-social atmosphere, sapping charisma from the tour and earning it
the label "Grumpy Old Men."</TE>
<TE>   "All we're doing this year is what Trevino and Chi Chi did a
hundred years ago," McCord said. "When those guys leave the tour,
that's a void that you can't fill, but we're going to do the best we
can with the guys we have to make this tour fun again."</TE>
<TE>   Hale Irwin, who won at Newport Beach in 1998 and won the ACE Group
Classic this year, acknowledged the changes might be intrusive at
times but said players have to do what they can.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a good move," Irwin said. "Letting the people walk
down the fairway, it's a little more intimate environment. It's a
much different perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Even on-course interviews don't seem to bother Irwin, who was
known to be surly with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a time and there's a place," Irwin said. "If there's an
understanding with the player that it might not be a good time, then
it's fine. I've done several interviews this year and not minded."</TE>
<TE>   McCord said that most senior tour players realize that the
survival of the tour depends on player participation in the new
initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys will do it and some won't," McCord said. "But the guys
out here aren't dumb. They understand that we've got to remarket this
thing and do something different."</TE>

<LD>I have a daily ATM limit of $300, so I knew I'd be cutting it close
trying to get through an entire day at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   I could not afford surprises like finding the $13 Staples Center
parking lot I usually use for Laker, Clipper and King games costing
$20 Thursday for the Pac-10 tournament. When I asked why the price
had been changed, a Staples spokesman said, because they can.</LD>
<LD>   "You can write that off to the company," an official said, and
while that's true, that cuts into our profits and all my retirement
money is tied up in Tribune Co. stock, and I'd imagine there are a
lot of you out there hoping nothing stops me from retiring.</LD>
<TE>   I also have a wedding to pay for, or counseling for my daughter if
successful in driving away the grocery store bagger, so these days
I'm used to eating at McDonald's, knowing you can get a double
quarter-pounder cheese value meal for less than five bucks in Yorba
Linda.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, when I ordered the same value meal at the
McDonald's in Staples Center, the clerk rang up a house payment.</TE>
<TE>   I thought about asking for some napkins too, but there's no
telling how much the folks at Staples charge for them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I called the corporate McDonald's headquarters to determine
if I had found the highest priced double quarter-pounder cheese value
meal in the state of California, customer service representative
Lupie Picarello said she thought Magic Mountain's prices might top
Staples.</TE>
<TE>   I told her Staples was charging $9 for a double quarter-pounder
cheese value meal, and she said, "Ouch," while admitting she'd have
to do some checking now because I just might have found the most
expensive McDonald's double quarter-pounder cheese value meal
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   While I waited for a return call, I ran into Carole and Allan
Forrest, two die-hard UCLA fans, who had decided to make an entire
day of it in Staples.</TE>
<TE>   Allan, a dentist who counts John Wooden among his victims, added
up what he expected to spend here, including a pair of $135 tickets
for the three-day event, parking, food and T-shirt, and the final tab
was a shock to him--almost $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   When he told me "That's a crown and three or four fillings," I
said that probably makes him an expert in rip-offs, and he laughed,
but I got the feeling I better not catch him the next time with a
drill in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   He asked if he could take a picture of his wife and me, and that's
my story and I'm sticking to it if a picture of a beautiful blond and
me pops up anytime soon on the Internet. As for the leggy brunet, I'm
working on that story.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TALK ABOUT rip-offs. Someone tried to sell me The Times walking
into the building for $1 because it included a placard that said, "Go
Huskies" or "Go Ducks" or "Go Cardinals." Had it read correctly: "Go
Cardinal," I might have bought it since Stanford was playing USC, but
I already get enough criticism for the number of grammatical mistakes
I make without holding up a sign with the nickname for a team that
doesn't exist. It appears we're in need of a placard editor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ONCE INSIDE the arena, Washington was playing Oregon, as if I
could really care, but then I figured somebody should look
interested.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Oregon band took up position at one end of the
court. The kids removed the folding chairs and made it clear they
intended to stand for the entire game, which included tuba player
Robert Mcfadden, who was parked directly in front of paying customers
Arnold Gold and Phil Mann.</TE>
<TE>   Gold offered me a chance to sit in his seat so I could see for
myself that when someone shot the ball, from his vantage point he
couldn't tell if the ball was going into the basket or the tuba.</TE>
<TE>   "We turned out to be lucky," Gold told me after Oregon's win over
Washington. "At the other end of the court the Washington band had
three tubas."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN IT came time for Stanford to play USC, I was very
disappointed no one from USC asked me to leave, because I was hungry
again, and of course no one goes hungry at Staples--they just go
poor.</TE>
<TE>   Staples officials, however, aren't very cooperative when you talk
like that or ask a question that might be critical of their cash cow.
When I asked why they had jacked up parking prices, they told me the
Democratic National Convention brought $137 million into the L.A.
economy. I didn't realize it was the Democrats who raised the parking
prices for the Pac-10 tournament, but it figures.</TE>
<TE>   The Staples folks also told me they have done the arithmetic and
the average person who comes to an event here spends $7 on food. That
sounds like Arthur Andersen-Enron-like math, because a bag of peanuts
costs $5, and I defy anyone to eat a bag of peanuts here without
buying a soda ($3.50), water ($3.25) or a beer ($6).</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10 provided free food to the media, but after what I'd
written about the Rip-Off 10 in Thursday's paper, I figured I best
follow Dwyre in line and make him my food tester. We can always get
another sports editor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A CUP of coffee at McDonald's here costs $2. If they sold
Starbucks on the premises, I imagine a Mocha Frappuccino would go for
something like $742.</TE>
<TE>   I paid the two bucks because I had to stay awake for the UCLA game
after the first three games of the day-night had the favored team
winning by an average of more than 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   I might even have to eat again to get through the whole game, but
the good news is the last game of the day looks like it might end
after midnight, which means I can hit the ATM again.</TE>

<HD>Pruitt Picks Himself Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gabriel Pruitt, a sophomore guard from Compton Centennial High,
covered his face with a warmup jacket as he slumped on the floor
dejected.</LD>
<LD>   His 28-0 team had just lost to two-time state champion Torrance
Bishop Montgomery, 57-55, in the Southern Section Division III-A
final Saturday at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   One by one, Bishop Montgomery players went onto the court to
accept their championship plaques as Pruitt lay motionless under the
basket.</LD>
<TE>   "It was hard," he said. "Even though I'm young, I felt like a
senior. My coach has been at it for a couple of years and I wanted to
give him a first championship. I felt I didn't do all I could to help
us win. It hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Not until Coach Rod Palmer walked up to Pruitt and tugged at his
jersey did he decide to get up and head for the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Pruitt was feeling the pain of defeat but already preparing for
the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking [about] what I have to do to get them next time,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Resiliency often separates average athletes from the great ones.</TE>
<TE>   Pruitt is one of the resilient ones. By the end of the day, his
healing process was at work.</TE>
<TE>   "I was still down when I left the Pond, but I was driving around
with my cousin and he was telling me I couldn't just sit there and
mourn that loss," Pruitt said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, rather than sit at home, watch television and wallow in
misery, Pruitt went to a gym and worked on his basketball
fundamentals.</TE>
<TE>   There are many games ahead for the 6-foot-2 Pruitt, who has a
devastating three-point shooting touch and flashes a constant grin on
the court that leaves no doubt how much he cherishes playing
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," he said. "I can't get away from it. I have to do it."</TE>
<TE>   It all started when his family moved near a park in West Los
Angeles. By age 7, he was spending all his free time at the park. A
coach spotted him, invited him to play for a team and he hasn't
stopped.</TE>
<TE>   This season for Centennial, he averaged 17 points in the regular
season and 20 points in the playoffs. His shooting skills are
exceptional for someone who once didn't consider himself a good
shooter.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a lot of practice," he said. "I realized you have to be a
good shooter if you want to be a good player. I wasn't really a good
shooter when I was younger."</TE>
<TE>   Said Palmer: "He's becoming an all-around player. His [court]
awareness is improving. He's understanding where his best shots are
coming from. He stays on an even keel all the time, and I think
that's good for a basketball player."</TE>
<TE>   Pruitt displays a calmness and comfort level that's unusual for a
15-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get nervous when I play," he said. "I know if I get
tense, that leads to bad things. I try to stay calm and hopefully my
staying calm will help my teammates get that good chemistry, where
we're all playing together."</TE>
<TE>   Centennial opened the Division III state tournament Wednesday with
a 63-51 victory over Bakersfield East. The Apaches (29-1) could end
up playing Bishop Montgomery for the Southern California Regional
championship.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Pruitt covered his face last weekend. He was plotting
his redemption.</TE>
<TE>   "I was visualizing the game and what I'll do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens to Centennial, Pruitt's basketball future is
certain.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned you have to have confidence because there's a lot of
people who don't believe they can do something," he said. "Every day,
I try to build my confidence."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As if college coaches didn't have enough reasons to pursue junior
guard Omar Wilkes of L.A. Loyola, add class to his list of
attributes.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes' basket with 11 seconds left gave the Cubs a 61-58 victory
over Thousand Oaks in the Division I-A final at the Pond. More than
30 minutes after the game, Wilkes decided to board the Thousand Oaks'
bus and shake hands with every Lancer player.</TE>
<TE>   It was sportsmanship at its best.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the early standouts of the high school baseball season is
junior right-hander Eric Hale of La Habra Sonora. He was 7-0 with a
1.18 earned-run average as a sophomore. This season, he has pitched
two shutouts, including a 1-0 victory over Santa Ana Mater Dei.</TE>
<TE>   His fastball is a consistent 88 mph and he doesn't walk many
batters.</TE>
<TE>   "He can get guys out," Coach Pat Tellers said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman left-hander Mike Robbins of Sun Valley Village Christian
had an impressive varsity debut this week. He threw a no-hitter
against Sierra Madre Maranatha, striking out 14 and walking none. He
retired 21 of 23 batters.</TE>
<TE>   He's 6-0 and 180 pounds, and throws a fastball, curveball and
knuckleball.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Internet is helpful for research and entertainment, but it can
be misused to spread false rumors. Sophomore Bryce Taylor of North
Hollywood Harvard-Westlake has been the subject of repeated comments
on a basketball message board speculating that he might transfer.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said there's no truth to any of the rumors. He's already
getting his classes finalized for next year. Sorry, Westchester fans.</TE>

<HD>Win Reflects Well on Seles</HD>
<DH>Tennis: She defeats 14-year-old Sharapova, a mirror image
of the young Monica, 6-0, 6-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>It's easy to forget that Monica Seles' trip to greatness included
some missteps as a 15-year-old. Not many, to be sure, but one tough
loss was against Chris Evert in the fourth round at the U.S. Open in
1989.</LD>
<LD>   The scene was an Evert love-in because her retirement was imminent
and a nervous Seles won only two games.</LD>
<LD>   "That was a tough one," Seles said. "I didn't want to be the
person--God forbid I beat her."</LD>
<TE>   Thursday, the racket was in the other hand, so to speak. Seles was
the legend, facing a promising teenager playing her first WTA
tournament, Maria Sharapova of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The score was the same, only this time in favor of Seles. She
defeated the 14-year-old, 6-0, 6-2, in 59 minutes in the second round
of the Pacific Life Open at the Tennis Garden. Seles saved two break
points in the opening game and went on to take the first seven.</TE>
<TE>   "She played great," Seles said. "I've seen her game. I knew she
was going to be a tough opponent, and she'll have a fantastic
future."</TE>
<TE>   Seles laughed when asked if the grunting, slightly built youngster
reminded her of herself. "Oh yeah, definitely," she said. "We look
alike. I was as skinny as she is."</TE>
<TE>   Sharapova, who turns 15 in April, was earnest about her
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to remember this for the whole life of mine," she said.
"The match today was unbelievable. I felt good about it. It's not
just juniors, it's pros. I think I handled it pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   Evidently Seles, a nine-time Grand Slam winner, made a distinct
impression on Sharapova as a child.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 6, everyone was talking about Monica," Sharapova said.
"I told my grandmother, 'I'm going to be her [Seles] someday.'"</TE>
<TE>   Seles noted that Sharapova's game looks a lot like Lindsay
Davenport's. Which makes sense because Davenport was once coached by
Robert Lansdorp, who is now coaching Sharapova.</TE>
<TE>   "Davenport didn't play like this when she was 14," Lansdorp said.
"I think [Sharapova] played extremely well. It's just a matter of
time. She has got to get a little faster, stronger and put some more
weight on. This match for her opened her eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Anna Kournikova and Martina Hingis pulled out of doubles
play--Hingis was said to have tendinitis of the right wrist--but
Martina Navratilova was at the heart of another stir, criticizing the
tournament's policy toward animals.</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova, who is playing doubles with Natasha Zvereva, said
that her Jack Russell terrier, Sophie, remained in her hotel room.
Apparently this was not Sophie's choice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my family," Navratilova said. "If I couldn't bring my dog to
a tournament, quite frankly, I would go somewhere else.... It's
tyranny of the minority."</TE>
<TE>   WTA rules say that animals are not allowed in the player
restaurant or locker room, and must be restrained by leash or
carrying case.</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova was incensed, she said, when a security guard called
her dog a pollutant.</TE>

<HD>ESPN's Weekend on the Brink</HD>

<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>ESPN's season is on the brink. College basketball's regular season
ends Sunday, and ESPN is on the verge of a programming nightmare.</LD>
<LD>   Some might call it a "Knightmare."</LD>
<LD>   But the problem isn't only "A Season on the Brink," the
obnoxiously over-promoted Bob Knight movie being widely panned. (The
Times' Howard Rosenberg reviews it in today's Calendar section, on
Page F29.</LD>
<TE>   Another problem is ESPN will have its own NCAA tournament
selection show at 4 p.m., immediately after CBS' selection show at 3
p.m., which has been expanded to one hour so that everything can be
covered.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the point of the ESPN show? So people who don't get CBS
can see it? Or maybe ESPN figures people are yearning to hear what
Digger Phelps and Dick Vitale have to say.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN used to have a competing show on at the same time as CBS'
selection show, but it conceded the 3-4 p.m. slot after getting some
concessions from CBS.</TE>
<TE>   One concession was that ESPN gets to televise the first NCAA
tournament game, the one between two teams playing for the 64th spot
in the field Tuesday at Dayton, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   That's fine, but putting on a selection show right after another
one on a competing network is overkill. Maybe the thinking was that a
selection show will be a good lead-in to "A Season on the Brink."</TE>
<TE>   But is it? CBS' Billy Packer, at a media gathering at CBS in New
York this week, said: "If I were at ESPN, I'd refuse to be on a show
that was going to be followed by a piece of garbage like that."</TE>
<TE>   The Knight overkill will continue after "A Season on the Brink."
At 7 p.m., ESPN will have a special one-hour "Outside the Lines" on
Knight and issues involving the controversial coach, including
whether ESPN and other media outlets treat him fairly.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN calls its Sunday night lineup "The Block." This weekend it's
more like "The Blah."</TE>
<TE>   Whether you watch the adult version of "A Season on the Brink" on
ESPN or the toned-down version on ESPN2--there are repeat showings on
both networks at 9 p.m.--you should have your fill of Knight by the
end of the night.</TE>
<TE>   But just in case you haven't, you can go on ESPN.com and bid on "A
Season on the Brink" props, costumes and cast-signed items.</TE>
<TE>   And what if Knight's Texas Tech team advances to the Big 12
tournament championship game Sunday, which ESPN is televising at
noon? ESPN no doubt will turn the game into one big promo for "A
Season on the Brink."</TE>
<TE>   Counter Programming</TE>
<TE>   There are some alternatives to the ESPN Knightmare.</TE>
<TE>   One is "Beyond the Glory" on Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   The excellent independently produced documentary series, the
highest-rated weekly program on Fox Sports Net last year, returns for
a second season at 8 p.m. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The series has a new narrator, with D.B. Sweeney having replaced
Jay Mohr, and the first of 20 new shows provides a compelling
in-depth look at Evander Holyfield.</TE>
<TE>   The good thing about "Beyond the Glory" is that the principals
involved, along with the narrator, tell the story. ESPN's
"SportsCentury" series relies too heavily on writers and broadcasters
to tell the story.</TE>
<TE>   Another plus with "Beyond the Glory" is no bad language. You don't
have to flip over to Fox Sports Net 2 to get a censored version.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Golf</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods made a dramatic run at Ernie Els on NBC last Sunday,
and there was also plenty of drama with the seniors on CNBC from
Valencia Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   Gil Morgan missed a double eagle on the final hole of regulation
by an inch and Tom Watson made a 123-foot chip to force a playoff,
which was won by Tom Kite.</TE>
<TE>   And it was all on live television. Last year, it probably wouldn't
have been.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the first year of the Senior PGA Tour's multiyear deal
with CNBC, only nine of 33 events were shown live. This year, 19 of
29 will be shown live, including the Toshiba Senior Classic at
Newport Beach Country Club this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   However, first-round coverage on PAX is delayed three hours in the
West.</TE>
<TE>   There have been a number of improvements in the overall coverage.
There are on-course interviews with players who agree to do them,
something that could someday be a part of all golf coverage. Some
players wear microphones. And there are various Internet activities
involving viewers at home.</TE>
<TE>   But ratings still aren't very good.</TE>
<TE>   "The next step is getting fans more familiar with the fact that
CNBC has golf and we have good shows," said Ken Murrah, CNBC's
coordinating producer of golf.</TE>
<TE>   Dunleavy to NBC</TE>
<TE>   Former Laker coach Mike Dunleavy, fired by the Portland Trail
Blazers after last season, has been hired by NBC as an NBA analyst.
He'll work with Mike Breen and make his debut March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Dunleavy replaces Tom Tolbert, who took Jayson Williams' spot. The
hiring of Dunleavy solidifies Tolbert's spot on the studio team
through the end of the season, NBC's last with the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Maternity Leave</TE>
<TE>   Fox's Jeanne Zelasko will be taking some time off after working as
a pit reporter at this weekend's Atlanta 500 Winston Cup race.
Zelasko, who is married to Channel 7's Curt Sandoval, is eight months
pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   "Curt has told me that it's time to come home," Zelasko said. "He
wants me to make sure that he meets our first baby before Darrell
Waltrip does."</TE>
<TE>   Tournament Tidbits</TE>
<TE>   Today's Pacific 10 Conference tournament semifinals will again be
televised by Fox Sports Net, with Steve Physioc and Marques Johnson
calling the action on both games. Saturday's championship game will
be on CBS, with Dick Enberg and Matt Goukas announcing.... On radio,
Chris Roberts and Bob Myers are announcing every Pac-10 tournament
game for KXTA (1150).... KMPC (1540) will offer Westwood One/CBS
Radio coverage of the NCAA tournament beginning Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   It has been rumored that Kevin Frazier is another candidate to end
up at Channel 7 if and when Bill Weir leaves to take a cable talk
show gig. But the powers that be at Fox Sports Net want to keep
Frazier. He's their marquee guy. Also, Rob Fukuzaki is likely to
inherit Weir's No. 1 spot, so Channel 7 is probably looking for a
weekend anchor.... Inga Hammond, formerly of CNN/SI, has been hired
to do updates for Fox Sports Net on a national and regional basis.
"Inga is a highly respected sports journalist," said Steve Tello, Fox
Sports Net's senior vice president in charge of news. "She will make
a strong contribution to our redefined news efforts."</TE>
<TE>   The new boxing promotion company, Goossen-Tutor, puts on its first
Sunday night show for Fox Sports Net this weekend. Tim Witherspoon
takes on Darroll Wilson at Green Valley Ranch near Las Vegas in a
card that will be shown delayed at 6 p.m.... An excellent feature on
horse racing legend John Henry, shown during Fox Sports Net's Santa
Anita Handicap coverage last Saturday, will be shown again Saturday
on "Santa Anita Live" on Fox Sports Net 2. John Henry, living in stud
in Lexington, Ky., turns 27 Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Highlights of tonight's opening ceremony for the Paralympic Winter
Games at Salt Lake City will be shown as a one-hour special on NBC on
Saturday at 11 a.m. The Games begin Saturday and run through the
following Saturday. Highlights of the competition will be shown
nightly on A&amp;E, 6-7 p.m.... Beginning Monday, ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC
will offer more than 25 hours of coverage from the Pacific Life Open
tennis tournament at Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   NBC's Jay Leno apparently isn't too excited about his network's
new deal with the Arena Football League. "Boy, how did we ever
wrestle that away from basic cable?" he said.</TE>

<LD>The regular-season Pacific 10 champion Ducks (23-7) swept the Trojans
by a combined six points this year, 73-69 at McArthur Court and 67-65
at the Sports Arena. The second loss came in the final seconds on a
Frederick Jones runner in the lane and cost the 22nd-ranked Trojans
(21-8) a share of the title. Ten of the last 11 games between USC and
Oregon have been decided by seven points or fewer.</LD>

<LD>This time the young and fearless attitude didn't work for Kansas
State.</LD>
<LD>   No. 4 Oklahoma had the 13th-ranked Wildcats, who start three
freshmen and one sophomore, frazzled early and had no trouble turning
a 17-point halftime lead into a 69-49 victory Thursday night at
Kansas City, Mo.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma (26-3) forced 23 turnovers by Kansas State (24-7) and
converted them into 24 points to advance to its second consecutive
Big 12 Conference tournament title game on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The Sooners will play seventh-ranked Baylor, a 91-83 winner over
No. 11 Iowa State.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some quickness defensively," said Oklahoma's Stacey
Dales. "When you have a young team, that pressure can fluster you.
They're really good in their youth, but it can get to you."</TE>
<TE>   Dales led an experienced squad--four starters have played in four
conference tournaments--with 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   Rosalind Ross, Caton Hill and LaNeishea Caufield had 13 points
apiece for the Sooners, who won their fourth consecutive.</TE>
<TE>   In Baylor's victory, Sheila Lambert had 20 points and 11 assists
as the Lady Bears (26-4) reached their first conference tournament
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor shot 53.7% and forced 21 turnovers by Iowa State (23-8) to
win its eighth consecutive. Danielle Crockrom had 18 points, Stasha
Richards had 17 and Stephanie Blackmon 16.</TE>
<TE>   Angie Welle led Iowa State with 22 points and 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Colonial--Monique Coker scored eight of her 18 points during an
18-5 run to start the second half, and 15th-ranked Old Dominion
defeated William and Mary, 73-52, at Norfolk, Va., in the
quarterfinals of the Colonial Athletic Assn. tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Lady Monarchs (23-5), unbeaten in league play during the
regular season, led, 31-26, at halftime and scored 16 of the first 18
points in the final 20 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Workers Bid Farewell to Mental Hospital</HD>
<DH>Observance: About 120 lost their jobs at Anacapa by the Sea
when financial woes forced the facility's closure this week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The banner over the shuttered psychiatric hospital said it all:</LD>
<LD>   "Closed for business. We've fought to serve, we've served to fight
... for mental health and all who have needed our help over the past
11 years."</LD>
<LD>   It was draped over the doorway at Anacapa by the Sea as about 40
of the hospital's former employees gathered Thursday for a subdued
farewell.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 120 workers lost their jobs and about 60 patients were
hurriedly transferred elsewhere when the Port Hueneme hospital
abruptly closed this week. Hospital executives said the institution
was mortally wounded by a managed care system that failed to cover
the costs of providing expensive psychiatric treatment.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's observance on the hospital's front lawn, pictures
were taken, goodbyes said, tears shed and a message somberly
delivered.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to be together with you who have been together with
me," said Charles Morris, Anacapa's president and chief executive.
"This is a terribly sad day."</TE>
<TE>   Some employees had lined up jobs at other hospitals, but others
didn't know where their next paycheck would come from. At a table
laden with cookies and pizza, a hospital official announced that
someone from the state would be on hand to talk about unemployment
insurance, and representatives from local colleges would distribute
information on job retraining.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Lejom had heard it all before.</TE>
<TE>   The psychiatric nurse had been knocked out of a job when Camarillo
State Hospital closed in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm having the same feelings now that I had then," she said. "But
this place has made me a better nurse, a better person."</TE>
<TE>   Some said the hospital offered both them and the patients a sense
of family.</TE>
<TE>   Trena Adams said she took a leave from her job in New York six
weeks ago for a temporary return to Anacapa's insurance department.</TE>
<TE>   "They needed me," she said. "This place has always been in my
heart. It's done wonders for a lot of people. It's saved lives."</TE>
<TE>   As an acute-care hospital, Anacapa treated inpatients for an
average of 10 to 12 days. Its outpatient program helped many of those
patients for four hours a day over a few months as they readjusted to
life outside, often in local board-and-care homes.</TE>
<TE>   Some staff members Thursday worried that the patients would no
longer have help with their medications. Many take as many as six
pills daily, and dosages must frequently be adjusted to minimize side
effects.</TE>
<TE>   "If they didn't show up here, we'd drive over to their
board-and-care and get them out of bed," said Sue Hadley, Anacapa's
nursing director.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, some patients became regulars at Anacapa. Staff
members got to know them and would draw joy out of the progress they
made.</TE>
<TE>   Hadley told of one patient in a wheelchair who tried to comfort
her during the shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   "He managed to get up from his wheelchair and hug me," she said.
"It just killed me."</TE>
<TE>   Steps, a substance-abuse program affiliated with Anacapa, will
remain open in its quarters near the hospital.</TE>

treatment.</CP>

<HD>Clinic Readies for Expanded Role</HD>
<DH>Health care: The North Hollywood facility's move to bigger
quarters will allow for treatment of more patients.</DH>

<LD>Overwhelmed by more patients than it can serve, Valley Community
Clinic will move into a larger, $5.5-million building next week,
allowing the North Hollywood facility to expand its health-care
services to the region's indigent and working poor.</LD>
<LD>   By making the move from its cramped Vineland Avenue location to
the larger building at Coldwater Canyon Avenue and Vanowen Street,
clinic officials say they will have more room to treat the 20,000
patients now served annually as well as the 10,400 patients the
clinic turns away.</LD>
<LD>   "In this economic climate ... we are grateful that this expansion
will allow us to provide vitally needed medical and health services
to so many more hard-working, low-income, uninsured people," said Ann
Brit, Valley Community Clinic's president and chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually, the larger quarters will allow the clinic to offer
prenatal, pediatric and dental care, which patients have identified
as critically needed services, clinic officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Work crews have spent the past month painting, laying carpet and
installing cabinets at the two-story, 45,000-square-foot building.
Clinic staff members, who plan to move into the new facility March
16, expect to see patients on March 18.</TE>
<TE>   The new facility is a former medical office built to meet state
codes for parking, wheelchair accessibility and other licensing
requirements for medical facilities, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic's current space is a cluster of converted retail stores
totaling about 10,500 square feet with limited street parking.</TE>
<TE>   Clinic officials said they expect that within three years the
annual number of general medical visits will increase from 20,000 to
45,000, counseling center visits from 4,700 to 8,420 and teen
health-center visits from 14,500 to 28,000.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of the building is occupied by medical service providers
that lease space from the clinic, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The lease payments would help finance the prenatal, pediatric and
dental services, among other uses.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to move into the new site represents a shift in
direction for clinic officials, who two years ago had planned to move
into a proposed commercial development across the street from the
North Hollywood subway station.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic fit the concept for commercial development in the
subway station area because it met a need for local residents,
according to Community Redevelopment Agency officials.</TE>
<TE>   Some business owners in the area, however, said the clinic was
incompatible with the intended aim of the redevelopment project to
attract mid-level to upscale stores, restaurants and entertainment
venues to the subway locale.</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiasm for the site cooled among the clinic's board of
directors after it discussed the proposal with its benefactors.</TE>
<TE>   "We surveyed our community, and a lot of our supporters were
skeptical about the clinic ever moving into the building by the 2006
completion date," Judi Rose, the community clinic's spokeswoman,
said.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the board decided in August that finding a larger
facility would be its top priority. The board learned that one of the
clinic's volunteer doctors was a member of a physicians' group that
had recently purchased the Coldwater Canyon Avenue property after its
previous owner went bankrupt.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators from both sides agreed on the $5.5-million sale price
in October and closed escrow Jan. 31, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic recently launched a funding campaign to help pay off
its debt.It was awarded a $1.5-million federal grant administered by
the city of Los Angeles for providing health-care services to the
community.</TE>

<HD>Commissioners Stress Parks' Fate Isn't Decided</HD>
<DH>LAPD: They won't vote on police chief's second term until a
formal evaluation is completed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wherever David Cunningham goes, the questions come at him: "What are
you going to do? What's going to happen?"</LD>
<LD>   As one of five members of the Los Angeles Police Commission,
Cunningham, 47, will cast a vote on the city's most burning issue:
whether Police Chief Bernard C. Parks will serve a second five-year
term, despite the opposition of Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, Cunningham, a land-use attorney, and his colleagues
find themselves in the spotlight--suspected keepers of secrets,
protagonists in conspiracy theories.</LD>
<TE>   Family members, friends and strangers ambush them with questions.
"I've gotten phone calls from people I haven't seen in years,"
Cunningham says.</TE>
<TE>   To all, his answer is the same. He, along with his colleagues,
won't decide the chief's fate until they have had a chance to
evaluate his performance through a formal review process. That's his
story, and he keeps repeating it, but he concedes, "It's hard for
people to really believe."</TE>
<TE>   When Hahn, who appointed the five commission members, recently
announced that he opposed a new term for the chief, he opened the
curtain on a full-fledged political drama. Many observers assume that
the outcome is foretold, but there remains enough uncertainty to
inflame speculation.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, four commissioners--Cunningham, developer Rick
Caruso, former U.S. Department of Justice official Rose Ochi and
attorney Silvia Saucedo--said the issue has brought them intense
attention. The fifth, San Fernando Valley car dealer Bert Boeckmann,
did not return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Ochi is eager to discuss the latest rumors.</TE>
<TE>   When told that one version casts her as the swing vote, her eyes
widen. "Is that right?" she exclaims. "Is that what they are saying?
No wonder I'm getting all these phone calls!"</TE>
<TE>   Saucedo calls the various scenarios "interesting" but says they
don't affect her much because she is determined not to be swayed by
anything but the commission's examination of the chief's record.</TE>
<TE>   It's an assertion that strains credulity for many City Hall
observers, police officials and community activists who are closely
watching the commission's every move. Most of the speculation is on
Hahn prevailing and Parks losing, while the commission's process is
viewed, at best, as a mere formality.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners have announced that they will meet in closed session
to evaluate Parks over the next four to six weeks before deciding
whether to keep him--subject to a City Council override.</TE>
<TE>   Even among themselves, the unpaid, part-time commissioners "have
tried hard not to show where we lean," Cunningham says. "We are not
just going through a sham on this."</TE>
<TE>   "We want to leave our legacy of being an independent and activist
Police Commission."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso, the commission president, says that means members should
represent the citizenry, not the mayor, and by extension should
decide on their own whether to reappoint Parks.</TE>
<TE>   The spectacle now playing out before the commission has all the
usual elements of an L.A. story--suspense, race, betrayal and, of
course, the LAPD. It casts Hahn, a white, first-term mayor with long
and deep family ties to black political leadership, against Parks, a
prominent example of black success and a local product to boot.
Partisans abound. And so does speculation--despite the commissioners'
protests.</TE>
<TE>   The commission members, installed in August, vary widely in age
and ethnicity. Ochi is Japanese American, Boeckmann and Caruso white,
Cunningham black, and Saucedo the daughter of immigrants from the
Mexican state of Durango. Saucedo is the youngest, at 28. Boeckmann
is the oldest, at 71.</TE>
<TE>   The group is heavy on attorneys--Ochi, Caruso, Cunningham and
Saucedo are law school graduates. Only one member, Boeckmann, had
served on past commissions appointed by Hahn's predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   Commission members describe their relationship with Parks as
uniformly polite and businesslike. Caruso, who deals with the chief
most often, says that he has lunched and dined with him and that they
have a "cordial, good, working relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso says he sympathizes with the uncertainty of the chief's
current position--one reason, he said, that "we have an obligation to
do this in a dignified manner."</TE>
<TE>   Commission Executive Director Joe Gunn says all five are willing
to voice strong opinions, are unafraid of taking minority positions,
and spar frequently and without animosity.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no sheep on this commission," Cunningham said.</TE>
<TE>   As to whether they are beholden to the mayor, Caruso gives a
sardonic answer: "What's the worst thing--that I get fired?"</TE>
<TE>   For Caruso, the job--which offers no pay for the privilege of
sitting through lengthy public meetings and poring through stacks of
bureaucratic reports--has proved especially nettlesome.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, some Parks supporters said they were planning to stage
a protest outside Caruso's newest development, the Grove--a mall
complex about to open next to Farmers Market in the Fairfax district.</TE>
<TE>   They have since reconsidered after holding what they termed
"productive" talks with the commission president.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso has given mixed signals about his feelings on Parks'
performance.</TE>
<TE>   He is assumed by some Parks supporters to share Hahn's opposition
to the chief.</TE>
<TE>   But Caruso also publicly criticized Hahn's approach early on,
saying the mayor's statements opposing Parks made the commission's
work harder. Caruso has further suggested that the city charter
should give commissioners the option of reappointing the chief for a
provisional one-year term--suggesting that he might want to offer
Parks such a chance if the option existed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Caruso also has echoed the concerns of community groups that
say that the pendulum has swung too far under Parks and that the
disciplinary system he has created has so fettered officers that they
no longer combat crime effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso, 43, is a Republican and served previously on the board of
the Department of Water and Power, where he established a reputation
for speaking frankly--almost to a fault, say some critics.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham, a Democrat, has served on the board of the Urban
League. His father is a former Los Angeles city councilman with close
ties to the late Mayor Tom Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his family background, Cunningham says he is often
assumed to be pro-Parks. And as an African American, Cunningham
concedes that he is sympathetic to the emotions evoked by a figure
such as Parks--a black man who broke race barriers to attain his
present prominence.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham said he also understands the historic concerns of many
Los Angeles blacks about police brutality and mistreatment, and was
once spread-eagled by officers who mistook him for a robbery suspect.
For some blacks, such concerns translate into backing of Parks, since
curbing police mistreatment of minorities by taking citizen
complaints seriously is a central tenet of the chief's reform
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Cunningham bridles at the suggestion that anything might be
assumed based on his family connections or race.</TE>
<TE>   With regard to his father, he said he has tried to "set ... my own
track record." Nor does being black mean he will support the chief,
he said. "For me, it's a matter of conscience," he said. "Because I
am black, I will be as objective as possible. For any minority ...
it's about performance."</TE>
<TE>   Saucedo, who is just four years out of law school, has a far lower
profile. The rumor mill often casts her as anti-Parks because she is
Latina, and Parks' removal might open the door to a Latino chief. But
Saucedo, who grew up the daughter of a cook in the Pico-Union area,
rejects this, saying, "When I think of the chief of police, I don't
attribute to him a particular race."</TE>
<TE>   She says her background helps her understand both the skepticism
toward the LAPD among some blue-collar Latinos and their dependence
on police to counter gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion that commissioners already have made up their minds
is offensive, she said. "I mean, I swore and testified before the
City Council that I was going to be independent.... I am going to
hold true to that."</TE>
<TE>   Ochi, 63, had, like Cunningham, ties to Bradley, for whom she
worked at City Hall on justice-related issues. A Democrat and former
teacher, she has come in for especially intense lobbying from African
American leaders whom she has long known. She was director of the
community relations service for the U.S. Department of Justice, and
has helped mediate disputes involving race and police abuse.</TE>
<TE>   She said that she is so averse to expressing an opinion about
Parks' reappointment that her friends and acquaintances know not to
ask her, and that she doesn't even discuss it with her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Boeckmann, a Republican who owns Galpin Ford, was first appointed
to the commission under Bradley, and later reappointed by former
Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has not spoken on the issue, speculators often surmise
that Boeckmann is Parks' most likely vote because he has strongly
supported the chief in the past.</TE>
<TE>   But Boeckmann once parted company with Parks in a conspicuous way:
When Parks was first up for appointment by a previous commission,
Boeckmann provided the one dissenting vote.</TE>
<TE>   The commission has established eight criteria for measuring Parks'
performance, such as prevention of crime, reform and community
policing.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the criteria may favor Parks' perceived strengths--fiscal
management, for example. Other criteria strongly echo the mayor's
criticisms of the chief.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Hahn has alleged that Parks has not fully implemented
a community policing plan that relies on so-called senior lead
officers. The commission's criteria also include whether Parks has
effectively utilized senior lead officers.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Hahn has made a connection between recruiting and
morale, saying officers' unhappiness has depleted the force.
Commissioners also make this connection, placing morale as a
performance criterion under the category of retention.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the five Los Angeles residents find themselves in
the position to make the decision is the result of quirks of the
city's history.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission was created by the 1920 city charter in an
effort to "diffuse power" and prevent corruption, according to USC
law professor Erwin Chemerinsky.</TE>
<TE>   By placing an intermediary between the mayor and chief,
progressive reformers hoped to make it harder for a corrupt mayor to
"dole out favors for cronies," Chemerinsky said. Thus, the mayor
appoints and fires commissioners but is not supposed to fully control
them.</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward a few decades, and the Police Commission could
arguably be called an anachronism. Today, there is little evidence of
the type of corruption it was created to combat, namely, bribery of
police by public officials. Instead, use of force has dominated
recent LAPD scandals.</TE>
<TE>   But the commission's role has been strengthened recently--first by
a 1992 proposition that imposed term limits on Los Angeles police
chiefs, then by a charter reform measure of 1999, and finally, by a
2000 federal consent decree over the LAPD, which highlights the
commission's management responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the challenge of convincing people of their sincerity still
frustrates and eludes commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is trying to say, 'C'mon, you know you have made up your
minds,'" Cunningham says.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it really and truly is important that we go through the
process.... We owe that to the city. We owe that."</TE>

<HD>Crystal Cove Funding Likely</HD>
<DH>Beaches: Prop. 40's passage is expected to provide money to
renovate the 1920s-era cottages and open them for overnight stays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An ambitious plan to restore historic beach cottages at Crystal Cove
State Park is expected to win full funding after the passage this
week of a statewide parks ballot measure.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 40 will funnel $2.6billion into park projects and
environmental initiatives across California.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, parks officials had secured only about half of the
$10million to $12 million needed to transform the dilapidated
cottages into beachfront lodges. Funds from the bond measure should
cover the rest, they said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a solid green light for Crystal Cove," said Roy Stearns,
deputy director of the Department of Parks and Recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Stearns said Crystal Cove has at least three potential claims on
Proposition 40 money: the $225million earmarked for improvements at
existing parks, the $267million for historic and cultural resources,
and the $200 million the California Coastal Conservancy will receive
for various open-space projects.</TE>
<TE>   State officials are now drawing up the list of projects that will
be funded. "Crystal Cove will absolutely be a high priority on that
list. It will be funded," Stearns said.</TE>
<TE>   The 46 vintage cottages, considered the last intact example of a
1920s Southern California beach colony, are between Corona del Mar
and Laguna Beach. They have been essentially vacant since the
longtime tenants who rented them from the state were evicted in June.</TE>
<TE>   The state took the action in an effort to make the picturesque
area more accessible to the public. But the parks department had been
criticized for evicting the tenants before it had secured funding for
the restoration of the cottages and installation of a new sewer
system.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major turning point for Crystal Cove," said Laura
Davick, an environmentalist who has pushed for improvements at the
park.</TE>
<TE>   The project calls for fixing up the cottages and offering them to
the public for overnight stays.</TE>
<TE>   Also being considered are an interpretive nature center, a center
for working artists, hostels and an ecological research center.</TE>
<TE>   The state also plans to remove El Morro Village, a trailer park,
from a portion of Crystal Cove.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) has proposed postponing the
El Morro evictions--scheduled for 2004--and increasing the rents
there to help pay for the improvements.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would withdraw his bill if funding could be found
elsewhere, but Thursday, Campbell said he isn't ready to do that yet,
despite the bond's passage.</TE>
<TE>   "Until [the money has been allocated] I'll continue to move the
bill forward," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   He conceded, however, that the chances are good that the funding
will be available.</TE>
<TE>   "What I think Proposition 40 does is open up new sources that
didn't exist on Monday for getting money."</TE>

<HD>Channel Isles Await Return of Bald Eagles</HD>
<DH>Environment: National Park Service proposes introducing the
birds under a five-year study to see if they can survive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Park Service officials hope to repopulate the northern
Channel Islands with bald eagles, 50 years after the majestic birds
were killed off by widespread pesticide contamination.</LD>
<LD>   A proposal to bring back the birds calls for a five-year study to
determine whether the eagles could survive independently on Santa
Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands off the Ventura
County coast.</LD>
<LD>   In restoration projects on Santa Catalina Island, residual effects
of the now-banned DDT--still lingering in a 100-ton pool of pesticide
on the ocean floor off the Palos Verde Peninsula--have prevented the
eagles from reproducing naturally.</LD>
<TE>   A toxic byproduct of DDT, called DDE, thins the shells of bald
eagle eggs, leaving them highly susceptible to being crushed by
mother birds before they are hatched.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers hope that the study, which would include extensive
monitoring of the birds early on, can prevent the same scenario from
unfolding on the northern islands.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by a committee of state and federal agencies, the
study would begin as soon as this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "If we find that the eagles aren't going to do any better on the
northern islands, everyone will have to rethink things and determine
what else we are going to do," said Laura Valoppi, a biologist with
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   The restoration effort is made possible because of a $145-million
lawsuit settlement with Montrose Chemical Co., a Los Angeles County
pesticide manufacturer that dumped an estimated 1,800 tons of DDT
into the ocean from 1947 to 1971. About $30 million of the settlement
is earmarked for projects to restore damaged birds, fish and other
wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Bald eagles, the United States' symbol of freedom, are still
listed as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species
Act, said Kate Faulkner, chief of natural resource management for the
Channel Islands National Park.</TE>
<TE>   During the last 30 years, the birds have repopulated in other
parts of the country, but the Channel Islands remain one of the few
areas where recovery goals have not been met, Faulkner said.</TE>
<TE>   "The bald eagles haven't wanted to come back on their own," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   As in the Catalina Island project, the eagles on the Channel
Islands would come from a breeding program at the San Francisco Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Up to a dozen chicks annually would be placed on Santa Cruz
Island, in boxes mounted to tall wooden poles simulating a nest
environment, Faulkner said.</TE>
<TE>   Then would begin a thorough--and potentially pricey--monitoring
program to collect data on the eagles' flight and feeding patterns,
as well as the health of the environment around the islands, Valoppi
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to just release eagles out there and walk away,
because we know there's a chance they won't do well, as on Catalina,"
she said. "All of this data is very important to answer these
questions before we move ahead and fully commit the money to restore
bald eagles on the Channel Islands."</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they do not yet know the project's total price tag.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed in the plan, which was unveiled last month, are four main
components: surveillance of the eagles using radio and satellite
technology; monitoring of the eagles' feeding on sea lion carcasses,
which are the primary carriers of the poison DDE; a program to
capture the birds at 2 to 3 years old and take blood samples to be
analyzed for DDE exposure; and collection of data to compare with
data from the early 1990s and determine trends.</TE>
<TE>   Early estimates put the cost of the study, not including the
blood-sampling portion, at $350,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists believe that at one time there were 24 nesting pairs of
bald eagles on the four northernmost islands. Their presence, reduced
over time by the intrusion of man, ended altogether with the
widespread use of DDT in the 1950s.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Still Intent on Annexing El Toro</HD>
<DH>Land use: Officials say they aren't deterred by Navy's plan
to sell base. Airport backers might contest Measure W and float
another initiative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine officials plan to forge ahead with their bid to annex the
former El Toro Marine air base and convert it into a sprawling park,
despite the U.S. Navy's plan to sell off the prime suburban real
estate to the highest bidder.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine City Councilman Chris Mears said that, because of Tuesday's
passage of Measure W, the Navy's announcement does not trump the
city's hopes to replace the base with a park. That vote rezoned the
area for a mix of parkland, open space and limited-density
educational uses, such as a university, zoo and botanical garden.</LD>
<LD>   "The people overwhelmingly said, 'Enough is enough. We want the
use described in Measure W,' and I think they ultimately will have
it," Mears said. "We're going to proceed with what we hope is the
successful annexation of the base as a Great Park."</LD>
<TE>   Irvine's stance capped a day of competing visions put forth for
the base's future. Undaunted by both the vote and the Navy's
announcement, pro-airport forces moved toward what could be a
last-gasp effort to salvage a commercial airfield at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   The Airport Working Group, a leading proponent of an international
airport at the base, was mapping out a possible legal challenge to
Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a group of airline pilots and aviation engineers
submitted a proposed November ballot initiative Thursday that would
supplant Measure W with a modified version of a previous airport
option called the V-plan.</TE>
<TE>   That option would realign runways to direct departing planes south
over parkland. But that proposal was rejected by county planners and
is opposed by the powerful Irvine Co., which fears it would send
flights over its expensive homes at Newport Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Under the V-plan, planes would land from the north, the opposite
of the path the county had proposed and voters rendered moot under
Measure W, which bars an airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park Councilman Bob McGowan, a former air traffic controller
and United Airlines pilot, said he hoped supporters of the Reasonable
Airport, Park and Nature Preserve Initiative can persuade Navy
officials to hold off declaring El Toro surplus and selling the
4,700-acre base. "The Navy is waiting for something else to come up,"
he said. "We have 30 days. We're hoping to have the signatures for
the ballot."</TE>
<TE>   The Airport Working Group and Citizens for Jobs and the Economy,
another pro-airport group, have backed the V-plan effort, said
organizer Russ Niewiarowski of Santa Ana Heights.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why [the Navy is] so anxious to put up a for-sale
sign," he said. "With our initiative, and the lawsuit, it'll send a
strong message that it's not over."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters said they will ask the Board of Supervisors to put the
initiative on the ballot without requiring them to gather signatures
of registered voters in the county.</TE>
<TE>   But the board's 3-2 pro-airport majority earlier refused to put a
similar measure on the ballot, and with Supervisors Cynthia P. Coad
and Jim Silva's announced plans to drop support for an airport after
the passage of Measure W, it seemed unlikely that the effort would
gain much support.</TE>
<TE>   Navy spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Pauline Storum said the Navy would
accept the V-plan proposal under the public comment period after the
release today of its final environmental review of El Toro. Any
submissions, she said, would be considered before the Navy announces
a final decision April 23.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials said Wednesday that they intend to sell the base,
either in parcels or as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I think overall we're trying to come to closure with the base
closure," Storum said, noting that the decision to mothball El Toro
was made in 1993, and it was closed in 1999. "Here it is 2002 and
we're still trying to finish the process."</TE>
<TE>   As developers and government officials digested the implications
of putting El Toro up for sale, Irvine emerged as a key force in
whatever happens to the site. As long as El Toro remains in
unincorporated Orange County--and Measure W is in place--development
will be limited to parkland and compatible uses.</TE>
<TE>   If Irvine annexes the base, it is not legally bound to Measure W's
limits.</TE>
<TE>   Airport supporter Bruce Nestande said his side argued all along
that any option other than an airport would eventually lead to
development. "It's all going to be rezoned now," Nestande said. "I'm
sure it'll give them open space and parks, [but] it'll be intense
land development: housing tracts, apartments, malls--the things that
make a community. All the developers and special interest, we now see
which side they were all on. They were not going to profit from an
airport, but they'll profit from a nonaviation option."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine officials, though, insisted that their motives are pure,
and that they will proceed with their Great Park plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our job to make them believe us," Mayor Larry Agran said.
"We all just need to kind of take a deep breath and think about this
for a few weeks and sort it all out."</TE>

<HD>Vapor Caused Explosion</HD>
<DH>Blast: Costa Mesa man who died kept several chemicals in
his garage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An explosion that killed a man and damaged homes throughout a Costa
Mesa neighborhood last week was caused when vapor from one of the
many chemicals in the victim's garage ignited.</LD>
<LD>   It was originally thought that Robert Jamison Marshall, 68, might
have been working with a welding torch in his garage before the early
morning explosion on Feb. 28, but fire officials dismissed that
report.</LD>
<LD>   "We have no reason to believe a welding torch had anything to do
with it," Costa Mesa Fire Marshal Tom Macduff said. "The liquid vapor
could have been from gasoline, paint thinner or an aerosol can. They
were all present in the garage."</LD>
<TE>   A series of blasts from the garage blew the walls of Marshall's
garage and townhouse from their foundation and shattered windows and
bent metal garage doors through the Monticello Townhomes community.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion led authorities to believe that a hydrocarbon vapor
was present. Macduff said investigators do not know what set off the
blast. "It could have been a cigarette lighter, a water heater
igniting. We'll probably never know."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall, whose body was found inside his garage, was identified
Wednesday by the coroner's office, which had to use dental records.</TE>
<TE>   "The only hazardous materials you should have in a garage is what
is absolutely necessary for upkeep," Macduff said.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Sharing His Viewpoint</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Browns' Park, overlooking the ocean in Laguna
Beach, is named for the family who had a home there for 60 years.
Owner gave the land to the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph E. Brown Jr. fondly remembers holidays and vacations at a
modest house overlooking the ocean in Laguna Beach.</LD>
<LD>   He celebrated his honeymoon there and often visited his parents,
who lived for years in the small, two-story home on a bluff with
panoramic vistas.</LD>
<LD>   "I loved that house," said Brown, who lives in Rochester, N.Y.,
and is retired. "The view was spectacular, and I enjoyed it
thoroughly."</LD>
<TE>   Now, because of his largess, others will have access to the scenic
spot off South Coast Highway. Though the house is no longer standing,
Brown has donated the land--valued at about $2 million--to the city
for a park in his family's name.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said such a gift of prime seaside property by a
private citizen is unprecedented. "I'm not aware of it ever happening
before," said Pat Barry, the city's director of community services.
"This is very unusual, simply because the land is so valuable."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who until eight years ago taught graphic arts and
photography at the Rochester Institute of Technology, said he is not
a wealthy man. He is financially comfortable, a widower with no
children, and considers himself rich for once having enjoyed such
exclusive access to the coast.</TE>
<TE>   "My family enjoyed it for nearly 60 years," he said. "Now many
families can enjoy it. I had an opportunity in my life that most
people never have: to enable thousands of people a year to sit there
and look at the ocean, people who would never accumulate the money to
buy a condo on the beach."</TE>
<TE>   Painting Hobby Led to Purchase of Seaside Lot</TE>
<TE>   Brown's family acquired the property in the mid-1930s when his
grandfather Charles A. Bergfeldt closed his tailoring business in
Kansas City, Mo., and moved to Orange County after the death of his
wife. He married an Anaheim woman, and they would drive to Laguna
Beach on weekends where he would pursue his passion for painting.</TE>
<TE>   "This was in the early years of World War II," Brown said, "and
there was tire and gas rationing. One day his wife said, 'Charlie,
maybe we could find a place down here so we don't have to drive down
on the weekends.'"</TE>
<TE>   Fears that the Japanese would invade the West Coast had driven
down real estate prices, so the Bergfeldts bought their place for a
song, Brown said. In 1941, they settled into the 1920s-era
two-bedroom, wood-frame house with a red brick chimney. It sat on a
long, narrow lot--25 by 100 feet--between Coast Highway and the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Bergfeldt died three years later. The house eventually went to
Brown's parents, who retired there after renting it out for years.</TE>
<TE>   Brown never lived in the house, but spent almost every vacation in
it. "I went out there frequently," he said by phone from his home in
New York, "and expected to keep going out there forever."</TE>
<TE>   The El Nino storms of 1997 washed away the lower part of the house
and a portion of the bluff, rendering the home unstable and
uninhabitable. Brown, faced with at least $200,000 in repairs,
decided to give the property away.</TE>
<TE>   "How many hearses have you seen pulling U-haul trailers?" he
asked. "You can't take it with you. I could have sold it and used the
money for something else, but then what my family could have left
would have been gone. I wanted a place where people could come and
enjoy the view."</TE>
<TE>   Grant Helps Pay for Path, Bluff Platform</TE>
<TE>   After taking title to the property in December 1999, the city
demolished the remains of the house, which was in the 500 block of
South Coast Highway north of Laguna Village and south of Main Beach.</TE>
<TE>   With a $275,000 grant from the California Coastal Conservancy, the
city last week broke ground for the park, expected to cost about
twice the amount of the grant. Plans call for a 100-foot path winding
from the sidewalk to a platform extending up to 20 feet over the
bluff. Officials hope to have the work done by mid-June.</TE>
<TE>   "You will get a peek of the ocean from the street," the city's
Barry said. "Then, as you walk out there, you will be able to get a
whitewater view of Main Beach. There aren't too many spots to view
the ocean from Coast Highway. People will be able to go out there and
get a great sunset view, including Catalina."</TE>
<TE>   The site will be called Browns' Park, a designation to be posted
on a plaque.</TE>
<TE>   "It's named after a whole three generations of my family," Brown
said. "I couldn't be more pleased."</TE>

<HD>Sex Party House Detailed in Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An undercover vice officer led jurors on a verbal tour of a Van Nuys
house for swingers Thursday, recounting the dance pole in the dining
room, covered hot tubs in the yard and an attic area open only to
nudes.</LD>
<LD>   Officer James Bradford testified that John Lynch's one-story house
had been converted into a pleasure palace for couples who like to
swap spouses for sex.</LD>
<LD>   Lynch, 50, is on trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court in Van
Nuys on charges that he violated the city's zoning laws. Prosecutors
allege that he operated a business in a residential area and ran a
sexual-encounter establishment without a permit. Both are
misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Los Angeles City Atty. Michael Pizzuti said city officials
got involved after receiving complaints from neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Pizzuti accused Lynch of running "a sham operation." He said Lynch
created a separate, off-site First and Fourth Amendment Club to
collect money from swinging couples before they would be invited into
his home for a party.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Lynch described it as "an intellectual club" where
people can obtain literature and discuss civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Roger Jon Diamond, told jurors in his opening
statement that they may find the sexual activity at the house
distasteful but said the case is not about his client's lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch's home, known as "The Velvet Swing," is listed in swinger
magazines. He said he invites as many as 40 couples on Fridays and
Saturdays for all-night parties.</TE>
<TE>   Bradford testified that he and a female officer paid Lynch $40 to
gain entrance to a party.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, a big-screen television showed adult videos, a coffee

was posted on the walls, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not your average living room," Bradford testified.</TE>
<TE>   The dining room was converted into a dance area, with hardwood
floors, a disco ball and brass pole, he said.</TE>

<HD>Lawyer in Dog-Attack Case May Be Cited</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A defense lawyer in the San Francisco dog-mauling case could be held
in contempt of court for allegedly calling the victim's partner a
liar, a judge said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge James Warren said he was told by at least six
people that defense lawyer Nedra Ruiz had said in a television
interview Tuesday that victim Diane Whipple's partner lied or
exaggerated about Whipple being bitten by one of two Presa Canario
dogs a month before she was fatally attacked.</LD>
<LD>   "It's precisely the type of conduct that is likely to infect the
jury, if they ever hear of it," Warren said while the jury was
outside the courtroom. "It does no good for counsel to go out and
make comments like that."</LD>
<TE>   Ruiz, who represents defendant Marjorie Knoller, appeared on a
television show on the Fox News Network titled "On the Record With
Greta Van Susteren."</TE>
<TE>   During the show, Van Susteren asked Ruiz about her
cross-examination of Whipple's partner, Sharon Smith, and about
Whipple's previous encounter with one of the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "What exactly were you implying?" Van Susteren asked.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz said she was implying that Smith was "exaggerating or lying
about an allegation that Diane was bitten in December before the
attack."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the interview, Van Susteren also asked, "Are you saying
that Sharon lied about it?"</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz said, "Yes, I am."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz was ordered to attend a court hearing on May 17 in San
Francisco to explain her conduct to the judge. If the jurist holds
her in contempt, she faces a maximum penalty of a $1,000 fine and
five days in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Warren went through a similar experience with Ruiz last summer
when she told reporters her client had an excellent character and
should have her bail reduced. She apologized to the judge, who did
not impose sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   During a break from testimony Thursday, Ruiz defended her comments
on the show.</TE>
<TE>   "I meant no disrespect to Judge Warren and no disrespect to his
orders," she said. "But I feel that my client has the right to be
heard. My client has a right to have her side explained, to have her
points made accessible to the media."</TE>
<TE>   Whipple, a 33-year-old lacrosse coach, died in January 2001 after
being attacked by the two dogs in the hallway of her San Francisco
apartment. Her neighbors, Knoller and Robert Noel, who owned the
dogs, were indicted in connection with the killing.</TE>
<TE>   The case was moved to Los Angeles because the judge was concerned
that publicity in the Bay Area would prevent Knoller and Noel from
receiving a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   The gag order in the case allows lawyers to provide reporters with
a brief update of the "results of the day's testimony and the purpose
for which such testimony was offered." But the order forbids them to
make any "comment regarding the credibility or veracity of any
witness."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who has an unconventional and dramatic style in the
courtroom, drew criticism last week when she asked Smith during
cross-examination if she believed she could have saved Whipple's life
by reporting the earlier attack.</TE>
<TE>   Smith testified that one of the dogs bit Whipple on the hand in
their apartment building in December 2000. The incident made Whipple
terrified of the dogs, Smith told jurors.</TE>
<TE>   But Ruiz said on the Fox show that she did not believe Smith and
Whipple were scared of the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "[Smith] contends that her life partner lived in fear to even use
her own elevator," Ruiz said. "Her life partner, Diane Whipple, was
afraid to go out into the hallway. I don't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cardoza, who represents Smith in a wrongful death civil
suit, faxed a letter to Warren on Wednesday about Ruiz's appearance
on the television show.</TE>
<TE>   "My client is extremely offended by Ms. Ruiz's character attack on
a nationally televised program," he wrote, calling the statements
slanderous.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Thursday, Cardoza said, "It's unbelievably
unethical. To say it's over the top is being euphemistic."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Dist. Atty. Terence Hallinan, who may face sanctions
for comments he made in January, also must appear before Warren on
May 17.</TE>
<TE>   During an interview with the San Francisco Daily Journal on the
grand jury proceedings that led to indictments against Knoller and
Noel, Hallinan said, "Knoller's testimony is full of such blatant
lies, and it's clear that she is just making things up."</TE>
<TE>   In testimony Thursday, a defense witness who was several floors
below where the attack occurred said he heard a woman's screams and
ran toward them to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "Her voice was wild," David Kuenzi testified. "I mean, she was
screaming for her life."</TE>
<TE>   Kuenzi said the screaming turned to a whimper and finally ceased.</TE>
<TE>   He said he then heard the "resigned" voice of a woman saying,
"Stop. Please stop."</TE>
<TE>   Kuenzi said he did not see who was speaking because he was too
frightened to approach the scene. Instead, he ran downstairs to call
police.</TE>

<HD>State to Fund Mural Face Lifts</HD>
<DH>Aesthetics: Davis sets aside $1.7 million to clean up
graffiti from freeway artwork. Some question the conditions that may
be attached.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to an increase in graffiti vandalism on freeway murals,
Gov. Gray Davis has set aside $1.7 million to restore some of the
myriad artworks that have given Los Angeles the title of "mural
capital of the world.''</LD>
<LD>   But the money may come with some tough conditions on all future
freeway artwork that could affect the placement of murals and even
the kind of paint artists use.</LD>
<LD>   The state Department of Transportation also has suggested that it
may remove some of the artwork most badly damaged in a recent wave of
graffiti vandalism.</LD>
<TE>   It is still unclear whether the money, part of the governor's
proposed 2002-03 budget, will pay the original mural artists or
professional restoration firms to make the repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that the murals are part of the community and a
source of pride," Caltrans spokesman Dennis Trujillo said.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction to the funding has been mixed. One muralist called
the $1.7 million "a drop in the bucket" compared with the money
Caltrans spends annually to paint over graffiti throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   The restoration money won't be spent until a professional art
restoration firm evaluates the condition of the 47 murals along Los
Angeles County freeways. That study is expected to be completed in
the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But Caltrans officials already have said that some freeway murals
may be too expensive to restore. Caltrans will meet with the artists
responsible for those works--which are yet to be identified--to
discuss plans to remove or reproduce the murals in other locations.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Caltrans has imposed a moratorium on new murals while
agency officials draft guidelines for future works, said Michael
Miles, Caltrans' deputy director for maintenance in Los Angeles and
Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Miles said one such restriction could require mural artists to pay
for a performance bond, ensuring the artwork is maintained for an
undetermined number of years.</TE>
<TE>   Although the money was welcomed by mural preservationists, some
worried about the proposed restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that resources are available to preserve these
public artworks, but the devil is in the details,'' said Paul
Hernandez, board president of the Social and Public Art Resource
Center in Venice, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving murals and
other public art.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said he worries that the restrictions might impose too
much of a financial burden on mural artists and discourage future
artworks.</TE>
<TE>   Agency Draws Praise for Restoration Effort</TE>
<TE>   Others applauded Davis' efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the good news is that the agency is recognizing that the
murals are artwork and are not just a graffiti abatement effort,"
said Felicia Filer, director of public art for Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has earned the reputation of mural capital of the
world for the about 2,500 murals painted on public and private
property throughout the county. Only 47 of those are along freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Many murals have recently come under attack by graffiti vandals.
In the past, the tagger culture had encouraged respect for artists
and heaped disdain on anyone who spray-painted over murals. But in
the last two years, a new generation of brash, young taggers has
started to violate that "taggers code," as evidenced by the
proliferation of graffiti on freeway murals.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans initially responded by painting over vandalized murals
with drab gray paint. But after loud complaints from artists and
others, the state agency adopted a policy in May of notifying artists
by certified mail when a mural has been vandalized. The agency also
agreed to lift a 45-day deadline for artists to clean the graffiti
before maintenance crews paint over the murals.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Miles said the problem with vandalized murals has not
improved. He said many artists are not responding to the certified
letters and taggers continue to ravage the region's freeway artwork.</TE>
<TE>   In response, he said Caltrans is considering adopting the
following restrictions on new murals:</TE>
<TE>   * All new murals would be set at least eight feet above the
roadway, to deter vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   * New murals would be allowed only on walls that are sandblasted,
to better hold the paint.</TE>
<TE>   * Mural artists would be required to use only Caltrans approved
paint, to ensure artworks do not fade or peel off.</TE>
<TE>   * Mural artists would be required to post a bond or sign an
agreement to maintain their murals, possibly for 10 years or more.</TE>
<TE>   "We have come a long way since these murals were put up during the
1984 Olympics, when people just slapped paint on a wall,"Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Ramiro, a renowned local mural artist, said the money
provided by Caltrans is not nearly enough to address the growing
problem. But he also points much of the blame on the taggers who have
repeatedly vandalized his car culture mural on the Hollywood Freeway
near the Alameda Street exit in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Ramiro said he has spent nearly $30,000 painting over the graffiti
on the mural more than three times: "Back when I put the mural up
more than 20 years ago, there was respect. Now, taggers have killed
the mural movement in Los Angeles."</TE>

<LD>Pam and Evan Kaizer just wanted their children to get an education in
democracy. Lesson One: Democracy is sometimes messy, often
complicated, and should not always be left in the hands of adults.</LD>
<LD>   For years, the Kaizers have allowed Los Angeles County to use
their Studio City garage as a polling place, in part so their
children could see how elections are run. On Tuesday, during an
election so troubled that County Registrar-Recorder Conny McCormack
calls it a "perfect storm," Max and Lily Kaizer found out firsthand.</LD>
<LD>   The Kaizer children, 16 and 12, were pressed into duty when poll
workers failed to show up at the precinct, a breakdown that was
repeated in polling places throughout the county. By all accounts,
including McCormack's, the two young people saved the day at Precinct
9001164A.</LD>
<TE>   "They did great," said poll captain Geoff McCalla, who asked the
Kaizers for help when he realized his workers were no-shows. While
there was nothing but praise for the children's performance, the fact
that they were needed illustrates just how badly the system failed in
the Tuesday primary.</TE>
<TE>   And technically, putting children to work violated state election
law.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the place where they were working was especially
sensitive: The Kaizers' garage is in Los Angeles' 2nd Council
District, where Wendy Greuel held a 55-vote lead over Assemblyman
Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City) Thursday with absentee ballots still
being counted.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas and Greuel representatives said they would need more
details to know whether their campaigns would raise questions about
the children's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "Potentially, any time there are illegalities you have some
concern," said Cardenas' attorney, Fred Woocher. The Kaizers were
Greuel supporters, although they said they took down lawn signs
before the election.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack acknowledged that the children were not qualified to
work in a polling place, but said it wasn't clear to her that they
were truly working.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly aren't going to pay them as poll workers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   State law says that only poll workers and voters are allowed "to
sit at the desk or table used by the precinct board"--by all
accounts, the Kaizer children did that--and that poll workers must be
registered voters, with an exception made for some high school
seniors. Max Kaizer is a junior.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors has asked McCormack to prepare a
report explaining what went wrong in Tuesday's election. McCormack
said she has just begun investigating, but it is already clear that a
confluence of unwelcome events made this one of the worst-run
elections in the county in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   Among the factors: statewide redistricting, which changed district
lines last fall; and a March primary, three months earlier than
usual, compressing the time that county election workers had to
prepare for the contest.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, changes in the primary voting system apparently
caused many poll workers to drop out at the last minute, McCormack
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It just sounded too confusing, too complicated," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Kaizers' precinct, McCalla said the county
failed to notify him of the names of the people who would be helping
him.</TE>
<TE>   One woman who usually works at the polling place showed up even
though she wasn't notified and wasn't on the county's list, he said,
but nobody else arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, I expect myself plus three" other workers, said
McCalla, 28, who has worked as an election "inspector"--the head of a
polling place--since he was 18.</TE>
<TE>   "Tuesday morning, I show up, set everything up.... My one
co-worker showed up on time--and no one else showed. So I went inside
and I called the registrar and I said, 'Hey, I've got myself and one
other person; I need a board. And if you won't supply me with someone
... I will just recruit people, whether they're registered or not.'"</TE>
<TE>   McCalla said he did not allow Max and Lily to handle ballots but
set them to work signing voters in. Several voters in the
neighborhood said they enjoyed seeing the young people working.</TE>
<TE>   Michelene Laski said she arrived at the polling place to find
12-year-old Lily behind the table. "The job this kid was doing was
fine," Laski said. "She seemed very mature, and I think she felt
important."</TE>
<TE>   Max Kaizer said he appreciated the opportunity to take part in the
election.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very interesting to see the whole process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lily had the day off from school because of parent-teacher
conferences, and her brother helped out after he got home from
school.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Greuel and Cardenas campaigns are keeping a sharp eye on
the final counting. Each had more than a dozen representatives at the
registrar-recorder's office Thursday to monitor county workers
verifying the authenticity of signatures on absentee ballots that
have not yet been counted.</TE>
<TE>   The large delegations included some high-profile experts on voting
issues, including Stephen Kaufman, an attorney for Greuel, and Fred
Woocher, an attorney for Cardenas.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman accused Cardenas supporters of trying unsuccessfully to
get election workers to set aside some absentee ballots on grounds
the ballots were not properly punched, a charge that Josh Pulliam, a
Cardenas aide, denied.</TE>
<TE>   Pulliam, in turn, charged that a Greuel supporter was trying to
get ballots with Spanish names set aside, but Kaufman denied that,
calling it "baloney."</TE>

<HD>Secession Foes Plan Unified Strategy</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Mayor Hahn and other opponents, mindful of
political backlash, pledge not to launch procedural challenges to a
vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Convinced that secession proposals by the San Fernando Valley,
Hollywood and the harbor area will make the November ballot, Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and other opponents are shaping a
strategy to fight the plans at the polls.</LD>
<LD>   City Council members, municipal labor unions and an anti-secession
citizens group say they will not try to head off a secession election
through procedural or legal challenges.</LD>
<LD>   Mindful of the potential backlash of thwarting a vote, Hahn has
made a similar pledge.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the anti-secession allies are preparing for a fall campaign
that will combine an expensive advertising effort with sweetened city
services in the breakaway regions, which are home to nearly half of
Los Angeles' population.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been festering for years," Hahn said. "Let's get it over
with."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, who intends to raise $5 million for the election,
already has begun showering the secession areas with such perks as
white-gloved traffic officers, new parks and special attention from
the city's business development team, all intended to bolster
preserve-L.A. sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign is being developed against a backdrop of increasing
credibility for the secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   Just Wednesday, they scored a major victory when a state agency
declared that Hollywood would be financially healthy as an
independent city. Finances for the Valley and harbor secession plans
also have passed preliminary muster.</TE>
<TE>   That agency, the Local Agency Formation Commission, which oversees
the incorporation of new cities, is expected to decide in late spring
whether the secession bids should be placed on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO has given strong indications that it will call for a vote on
all three plans. If it does, the county Board of Supervisors would be
asked to authorize an election.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals reached LAFCO after secessionists gathered the
signatures of 25% of the registered voters in each region. The
commission is reviewing the plans to ensure that the areas could
survive on their own as cities, and that their departure would not
leave the remainder of Los Angeles in a financial bind.</TE>
<TE>   The review and an election could be delayed if the city or another
party files a lawsuit challenging the commission's procedures.</TE>
<TE>   By foregoing such action, secession opponents are resigning
themselves to a huge election battle over civic identity, city
services, taxes and even Hahn himself. To win, each secession measure
must get a majority of votes both within the breakaway region and
citywide.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that this never goes away unless people get a
chance to vote on it once and for all," said Lisa Gritzner, chief of
staff to Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who represents the West San
Fernando Valley and is a secession opponent.</TE>
<TE>   An executive of the largest city union agreed. "There is a general
consensus not to do anything that keeps it from getting on the ballot
in November," said Julie Butcher, general manager of the Service
Employees International Union, Local 347, which represents 8,500 city
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The union opposes secession because it fears a breakup would
endanger their members' contracts and job security. Last month, it
asked LAFCO to reject the secession measures outright. At that time,
Butcher called a study of the proposed Valley city's financial base
"materially defective."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's representatives lobbied hard to convince the union and One
Los Angeles, a Valley-based anti-secession group, not to try to block
an election, breakup opponents say.</TE>
<TE>   A big reason for focusing on 2002, insiders say, is fear that Hahn
would be politically damaged by a delay in the vote. Hahn had
promised during his mayoral campaign not to sabotage a secession
ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the mayor has antagonized civic leaders in the
vote-rich Valley by removing secession supporters from appointed
positions and taking actions that seemed aimed at shelving a vote. He
also angered African American leaders by not backing Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks for a second term. In the harbor area, his position
on Parks has prompted African American leaders to join forces with
secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to give them a big issue by postponing the vote,"
said Kam Kuwata, a political consultant who worked on Hahn's election
and is helping develop the anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The opponents also believe that the November election will attract
a large number of voters unsympathetic to secession. The idea is that
blocs of liberal and minority voters, drawn by the gubernatorial race
and other statewide contests, will resist arguments that the city
should be dismantled.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, delaying the vote would mean that Hahn might have to
fight secession in 2004, while preparing for his reelection bid the
following spring.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's anti-secession campaign will combine generous city
services, including a massive tree giveaway and a new park a month in
the Valley, with a two-pronged advertising campaign, breakup
opponents say.</TE>
<TE>   Some ads will probably evoke an emotional theme about keeping Los
Angeles together. Others will point out what opponents see as flaws
in the secession proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "Our attitude is the more flawed that thing is when it goes on the
ballot, the easier it will be to beat it," said Larry Levine, a Van
Nuys political consultant who has organized One Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the anti-secessionists have focused on the Valley, because
the breakaway movement there is the oldest and best organized and has
the most support. Valley secession is also the most likely to make
the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   There, opponents plan to frighten voters with warnings about
higher prices for services from water to public safety, Hahn advisors
say.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign would also attempt to convince voters that if the
Valley, Hollywood and harbor area form their own cities, they will
remain at the mercy of L.A. politicians who might not be responsive
to them.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed cities would probably lease major city services,
including police and fire protection, as well as water and power,
from Los Angeles for several years after they are formed.</TE>
<TE>   Fodder for the campaign is expected to come from secession
analyses requested by the mayor and council. The analyses largely
address municipal finances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ammunition for the campaign," said a Hahn advisor, speaking
on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also is counting on a significant fund-raising advantage
over the secessionists, who have not begun to solicit donations in
earnest.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, a former state assemblyman who serves on the board
of the secession group Valley VOTE, said secessionists will start
their fund-raising drive in late spring or early summer, after it is
clear that the measure will be on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Katz said, he expects potential donors to hold back
out of fear of alienating Hahn and other powerful secession
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said that the secession movement has not yet set a
fund-raising goal or developed a campaign, although Jeff Brain,
president of Valley VOTE, has consulted with pro-secession groups in
Hollywood and the harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hahn and other opponents continue to try to strengthen
the city's hand through legal opinions and positions the city takes
in negotiations with secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the city proposed that Los Angeles keep ownership of Van
Nuys Airport in a post-secession Valley. A LAFCO committee rejected
that idea.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn "wants a politically unattractive measure on the ballot in
November," said Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE. "His strategy
is to kill it on election day."</TE>

<HD>Board Secretly Urged Killing Ballot Item</HD>
<DH>County: Supervisors asked counsel not to certify
health-aide pay initiative. He later reversed course, based on risk
of a lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors secretly directed its
lawyer to kill a proposed ballot initiative aimed at raising the
salaries of low-paid health aides who care for the elderly at home.</LD>
<LD>   County documents obtained by The Times describe a series of
closed-door meetings and telephone calls regarding the measure, which
would increase the aides' hourly wages from $6.75 to $11.50.</LD>
<LD>   During those meetings, the supervisors told their lawyer, County
Counsel Lloyd Pellman, to refuse to write and release the title and
ballot summary of the measure. Supervisors Gloria Molina, Don Knabe,
Mike Antonovich and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke agreed to direct Pellman
to refuse to certify the measure.</LD>
<TE>   "I was outraged," said Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, the only
dissenter. "I said: 'That's the most outrageous thing I've ever
heard.'"</TE>
<TE>   "I told Bill Pellman and I told the board: 'You are going to get
reamed for this.'"</TE>
<TE>   Pellman investigated the possibility of not releasing the title
and summary, but documents show that he ultimately concluded he was
obligated to perform that work under the law.</TE>
<TE>   The county counsel called at least three board members to inform
them of his conclusion. Molina has complained that Pellman violated
the state's Open Meetings Act by speaking to a majority of board
members without posting notice of a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Pellman said in an interview Thursday that he was not collecting
votes. Rather, he said, he was simply informing them of a decision he
had made.</TE>
<TE>   Molina said in a letter to her colleagues that Pellman's conduct
undermined the board's ability to act in a "fair and unbiased
manner."</TE>
<TE>   Molina was out of the country Thursday, and an aide said she would
not comment on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a last-ditch effort by the health aides to force the
supervisors to accept a pay increase that the state has already
agreed to match, according to Tyrone Freeman, president of Service
Employees International Union 434B, which represents the workers.</TE>
<TE>   In-home health supportive service aides--who are paid by a
combination of federal, state and county money--have battled for
years with the county over pay increases and health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman said he was outraged by the supervisors' covert attempts
to derail the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a blatant abuse of authority and a total disregard
for the care of seniors and the workers who are making minimum wage
caring for them," Freeman said of the board's actions. "Sometimes
you're just lost for words for what they do."</TE>
<TE>   In December, the group filed its intention with the county
registrar- recorder to begin gathering signatures to put the measure
on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The board, which pays 22% of the aides' salaries, responded by
holding a closed-door brainstorming session Dec. 18 with the county
counsel on how to defeat the measure, according to county documents.
The discussion was listed on the board's agenda as exempted from open
meetings laws because it concerned potential litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said the board was concerned that the measure might
establish the precedent of allowing voters to set salaries. He said
the measure, if passed, could cost the county as much as $200
million.</TE>
<TE>   "They should be paid more than the minimum wage, but whether they
can do it by initiative is another story," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The board could have voted to sue the proponents to block the
measure. Pellman had given the board the results of a review he
commissioned from O'Melveny &amp; Myers, a well-known Los Angeles law
firm, which concluded that the proposed initiative asked questions
that legally could not be put to the voters.</TE>
<TE>   But Pellman said in county documents that such a lawsuit had very
little chance of success, so he proposed another solution: refusing
to certify the measure.</TE>
<TE>   That proposal would have kept the measure off the ballot
altogether by circumventing the normal route that initiatives take to
appear before county voters.</TE>
<TE>   By state law, that process starts with the proponents filing a
notice of intention, which includes a written statement of the
questions they hope to put before the voters. County counsel is
required within 15 days to write a ballot title and summary and
deliver it to the registrar-recorder. Without it, the measure will
not reach the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   At that closed-door meeting Dec. 18, one day before Pellman had to
deliver the title and summary, he suggested to the board that he
could ignore his ministerial duty "in an effort to force the
proponents to sue" the county, he wrote in an internal county
memorandum.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes of the meeting show that a majority of the board agreed
with Pellman's suggestion and directed him to draft a letter to the
home health aides and inform them of his move.</TE>
<TE>   The board did not announce this decision to the public after the
closed session.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said the board's mandate, had it been carried out,
would have opened the door to criticism that it manipulates the
voting process to hurt measures it does not support. Such allegations
were raised in 2000, when the county miscounted the number of valid
signatures for a ballot measure that would have set term limits for
county officials, preventing it from appearing on the ballot that
November.</TE>
<TE>   He said the board was not responsible for the foul-up, but "here
is something we do have something to do with and we will rightly be
accused of manipulating the process."</TE>
<TE>   When the deadline to release the title and summary arrived,
however, Pellman had second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "As I contemplated what to present in the letter to the attorneys
for the proponents ... I realized that any refusal to act on my part
would lead to delays, possibly fatal in extent, in the processing of
the initiative," Pellman wrote. Both he and the county would probably
be sued for civil rights violations, he concluded.</TE>
<TE>   According to the county documents and interviews, Pellman
proceeded to call at least three of the supervisors individually to
fill them in and asked them what to do. Molina now believes those
calls violated open meetings laws, according to the county documents.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on these conferences, there was not substantial support for
[taking] the risk" of being sued for civil rights violations, Pellman
wrote. He sent out the title and ballot summary at 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how incompetent or incomplete the advice of county
counsel was on the day the board voted," Molina wrote in a memo, "the
remedy for this mistake should have not included a circumvention of
our protocol and a violation of the Brown Act."</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors discussed Pellman's actions at another closed-door
meeting Jan. 4, and Molina asked that it be discussed in public at
the Jan. 8 meeting. Instead, the item was taken up in closed session
because it ostensibly involved a personnel matter: Pellman's
performance.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors had all declined to discuss the matter until this
week, when the county declined a public records request from The
Times regarding the issue but enclosed with the denial the records
sought. County officials subsequently said it was a mistake to
include those records and demanded their return.</TE>

<LD>Meet Curt Livesay, a.k.a. the Revenuer, Dr. Death, the Juiceman.</LD>
<LD>   No, he's not the latest thug on the FBI's most wanted list, as one
might expect with such a list of aliases.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, he's quite the opposite. The amiable, onetime cowboy is
the recently named chief deputy to Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, which
means Livesay is second in command to the top prosecutor in Los
Angeles County.</LD>
<TE>   Livesay has been tagged with the nicknames during his 26-year
career on the right side of the law.</TE>
<TE>   But he doesn't mind telling you he comes from a family of outlaws,
on his daddy's side, that is.</TE>
<TE>   The outlawry goes back to two of his father's uncles.</TE>
<TE>   They were simultaneously hanged for train robbery in the late
1800s in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   One of his own uncles was a bank robber and a bootlegger in the
Ozarks of Oklahoma. He got killed in the 1950s because, Livesay
suspects, he ran afoul of somebody in the moonshine business.</TE>
<TE>   And Livesay's father, Leonard, spent five months on a Texarkana,
Texas, federal prison farm for making illegal whiskey.</TE>
<TE>   "He was convicted of a tax violation for not having appropriate
tax stamps for the sugar," Livesay says in his pronounced Southern
drawl.</TE>
<TE>   His father didn't need to run whiskey stills to support his wife
and three children. He owned the Lone Star Ranch, a 1,000-acre spread
where he pastured more than 400 cows.</TE>
<TE>   In those days, bootlegging was sort of a way of life in the
Ozarks, and nobody liked revenuers.</TE>
<TE>   Livesay was 5 when his father was arrested. It happened at a
family get-together, and Livesay watched officers handcuff him and
take him away.</TE>
<TE>   After getting out of prison, his father quit bootlegging, and that
little piece of family history was relegated to the proverbial
closet. His mother, who was half Irish and half Choctaw Indian, would
never mention it, Livesay recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Later, thanks to a judge and a congressmen, a pardon was granted
by President Harry Truman, Livesay says.</TE>
<TE>   As the years of his youth passed, Livesay learned to work hard. He
helped deliver calves, kept the branding irons hot, gathered in the
hay during the summer and fed it out in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   "On the ranch, from the time you are able to walk, you have to
learn to take responsibility," he says. "Nothing else since then has
seemed like work."</TE>
<TE>   Livesay headed west after high school--at the urging of a sister
in Los Angeles and her husband--to enroll at UCLA, where he studied
business and accounting. Livesay's plan was to become a tax lawyer
and join his brother-in-law's firm.</TE>
<TE>   The ranching work ethic got him through college a semester early
in 1962, and he took a job with the Internal Revenue Service as a
field audit agent, figuring the experience might come in handy later.</TE>
<TE>   When Livesay returned home carrying a U.S. Treasury Department
badge, friends and relatives didn't take too kindly to his new job.</TE>
<TE>   "They called me the Revenuer," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Livesay didn't keep the Treasury credential very long. In less
than a year, he was back at UCLA, enrolled in law school. But by the
time he got his law degree, he had dropped his plan to become a tax
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he applied for jobs in the offices of the public defender
and the district attorney, accepting a prosecutor's post only because
it was offered four hours earlier than a job in the defender's
office, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Livesay started prosecuting criminals in the D.A.'s Long Beach
office in 1965, and in quick order, rose to head deputy of the D.A.'s
juvenile division, and then to head of central operations. In 1979,
then-Dist. Atty. John Van de Kamp appointed him chief deputy for the
first time. During the administrations of Robert Philibosian and Ira
Reiner, Livesay was assistant district attorney, the No. 3 position
in the office.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout that tenure, he earned high marks from colleagues for
his administrative skills.</TE>
<TE>   Among his responsibilities was deciding when the district
attorney's office would seek the death penalty in murder cases. It
wouldn't be long before people started calling him Dr. Death.</TE>
<TE>   The name was gallows humor, he says, bestowed as a joke by defense
lawyers, who by most accounts respected the fairness and openness by
which he arrived at his decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "He demonstrated solid judgment repeatedly when he was handling
the final decisions on death penalty cases," says Los Angeles County
Public Defender Mike Judge.</TE>
<TE>   Such evenhandedness probably reflects Livesay's views about the
death penalty, which are a bit murky, in that he's not opposed to it,
nor does he advocate it. He has prosecuted people facing the death
penalty, and he defended them during a 10-year stint as a defense
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The origin of his ambivalence is not entirely clear, though he
ties it in large part to his family's colored past.</TE>
<TE>   "I've found a division in my family on some of the outlaws and
their fates, with my mother telling me they got what they deserved,
and other people in the family being opposed to the death penalty. So
I didn't come in with a view of whether I'm for it or against it."</TE>
<TE>   But he was decidedly against being known as Dr. Death.</TE>
<TE>   He despised that sobriquet almost as much as he disliked his next
one--the Juiceman.</TE>
<TE>   He got pegged with that one by career criminal Leslie Vernon
White, a clever snitch who was the focus of a major scandal over the
misuse of jailhouse informants by the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   White demonstrated how he could fake a confession by another
inmate and trade that information to prosecutors and police in return
for favors. Other informants did the same thing. It prompted a grand
jury report in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no idea an inmate could do that," Livesay says. His role
was to review trial prosecutors' requests to use jailhouse informants
in major cases.</TE>
<TE>   When inmates learned that he had the "juice" to make things happen
for them, White dubbed him "the Juiceman," Livesay recalls. "It was
an awful, awful name."</TE>
<TE>   He says the scandal prompted reforms. And it was the only major
controversy that enveloped him during the 25 years he had been in the
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Livesay left in 1991 to enter private practice. White and the
informant scandal faded from his life, but only until he returned to
the district attorney's office shortly after Cooley was elected.</TE>
<TE>   A year later Cooley appointed him chief deputy. Livesay had held
that post on a temporary basis to help Cooley organize the office.</TE>
<TE>   "I hadn't been at that desk more than three days before White
calls me from Mule Creek State Prison," Livesay says. Somehow, he had
heard Livesay was back with the district attorney and had called,
ostensibly, to congratulate him.</TE>
<TE>   It soon became clear--White was back to his old tricks.</TE>
<TE>   "He says, 'I'd like to tell you about something,' and 'I think you
can help me out some too,'" Livesay says, recounting the
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the Juiceman was wise to White's scam.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Les," Livesay says. "He's untrustworthy and a liar, and I
wasn't about to act on anything he had to say."</TE>

<HD>Election Turnout Hit a New Low</HD>
<DH>Only about a third of registered voters cast ballots, even
fewer than forecast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the terrorists struck and the buildings fell, Americans united
in a surge of patriotism not seen in a generation. On Tuesday in
California, citizens were asked to join in what may be the most
patriotic ritual of all, the celebration of democracy known as
voting.</LD>
<LD>   Two out of three registered voters were no-shows.</LD>
<LD>   Turnout has been falling for more than 30 years, but this primary
election appears destined to make history: Never before has such a
small fraction of the California populace cast ballots.</LD>
<TE>   People had plenty of reasonable excuses: I was too busy. The
ballot measures were confusing. The negative ads were a turn-off.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts put forth other theories: The primary was too early. The
Olympics were a distraction. There was no gubernatorial contest for
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, election officials who had hoped the
traumatic events of 9/11 would inject new life into the electorate
were disappointed. As one disgusted poll worker said: "Patriotism is
more than putting an American flag sticker on the back of your SUV."</TE>
<TE>   Unofficial results show that 31% of California's registered voters
went to the polls Tuesday. That number will climb by a few percentage
points as counties tally some absentee and provisional ballots over
the next week. But it is not expected to pass the previous historic
low of 35% recorded in June 1994.</TE>
<TE>   When computed as a percentage of those who were eligible to vote,
rather than those who are registered, Tuesday's turnout looks even
worse. Officials say only 22% of those Californians who could have
voted actually did.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping for a Bump but Seeing a Slump</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones, who took office in 1994 with the
dreamy goal of boosting turnout to 100%, calls the participation
level "extremely discouraging."</TE>
<TE>   "We have done everything we can to encourage turnout, but voters
have not made that connection between the politics of elections and
the governance of California," Jones said. "I was hopeful the tragedy
of 9/11 might renew interest in voting. Clearly it has not."</TE>
<TE>   Jones was not the only elections chief hoping for a surge--nor was
he the only one jolted by the reality of a decline. Minnesota
experienced a bump in turnout in municipal elections held Sept. 11,
an increase attributed to the gut-wrenching terrorist attacks. But in
many other states since then, voter interest has dipped.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, for instance, turnout for the November general
election--which featured two ballot initiatives on taxes--was 13
percentage points below the 1999 figure. Virginia and New Jersey
elected governors in November, and turnout was down about 3% and 7%,
respectively, from the previous governor's races in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In Georgia, meanwhile, a special election to fill a state Senate
seat was decided by just 3% of the electorate: "It's always low in
specials, but we usually get 15%," lamented Georgia's director of
elections, Linda Beazley. "This is dismal. What's wrong with our
voters?"</TE>
<TE>   In California, some say that it's not lazy or busy voters but a
peculiar conspiracy of circumstances that are to blame. The absence
of a primary challenger to Gov. Gray Davis made the election less
interesting to Democrats, and new primary rules affecting who may
vote for which candidates might have discouraged other potential
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Early Primary Date Assessed Some Blame</TE>
<TE>   In some areas, such as Los Angeles, some polling places didn't
open on time and in some cases ballots weren't delivered. And,
perhaps most important, surveys suggest that the unusually early date
of this year's primary--the earliest of any state's--left many
Californians unaware an election was coming up.</TE>
<TE>   "We've changed the date and changed the rules so much that there's
bound to be confusion and less incentive to participate," said Kim
Alexander, president of the nonprofit California Voter Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, she argued, the bitterly disputed Florida ballots that
clouded the 2000 presidential election "may have left people feeling
their vote doesn't count at all."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, there were meaty measures at stake Tuesday--a bond
issue for parks and water, an effort to revise term limits--as well
as hotly contested Democratic races for Assembly seats. That was
particularly true in Los Angeles County, where turnout was a paltry
23%.</TE>
<TE>   "There are plenty of important reasons to vote," said Tony Miller,
former acting secretary of state. "But people have other priorities.
They don't see it as a responsibility, and they aren't focused on the
political process."</TE>
<TE>   Nonvoters themselves offer myriad reasons for staying home
Tuesday, illustrating why attacking the turnout problem is such a
daunting task.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Jim Hodge of Fresno, reflect the well-documented
cynicism in the electorate: "Politics are crooked," declared Hodge,
54, a small-business owner. End of story.</TE>
<TE>   Others say they feel guilty about not voting but also deterred by
the avalanche of ads--many of them negative--on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm being scammed all the time," said Anne
Touloukian, 39, who works at a department store in the Sacramento
suburb of Citrus Heights and last voted in 1992. "The ads say, 'Vote
for this so your child has clean water.' I know there's more to the
story, but what? And who's behind it?"</TE>
<TE>   Others say they vote periodically, but not consistently. Tucker
Farrar, 26, is a Princeton University graduate who listens to public
radio and knew the names of most candidates seeking statewide office.
He intended to vote, but in the end, decided to go to the gym
instead.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's terrible, and my fiancee and I even talked about how
voting is a right, that we shouldn't take it for granted," Farrar
said.</TE>
<TE>   Was it inconvenient? "No, it was a two-minute drive away. I just
didn't get it together."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars say the tumbling turnout is a distress signal for
democracy. If more people voted, they argue, politicians would react
more to the needs of the masses than the wishes of special-interest
groups. Others say it is simply unhealthy for people to be so
detached from their political community.</TE>
<TE>   "In these low-turnout elections, you have the broadest-based
oligarchy in the world," said Walter Dean Burnham, an elections
expert at the University of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Reversing the Decline Defies Easy Solution</TE>
<TE>   But reversing the decline is no simple matter. Making voting more
convenient--allowing people to register at their Department of Motor
Vehicles office, for instance, and relaxing rules governing absentee
ballots--have failed to have much effect.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say it will take a wholesale effort--from an
aggressive civics curriculum in schools to Internet voting--to
reignite interest. A few advocate a harsher tonic--compulsory voting.</TE>
<TE>   Australia, Belgium, Greece and many Latin American countries
require citizens to vote--and threaten a variety of penalties,
including jail time, for those who don't. The idea has not exactly
caught fire, but Arend Lijphart, a UC San Diego political scientist,
believes compulsory voting is no worse than other mandated burdens,
such as jury duty and school attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people in the United States react in horror to the idea,"
Lijphart said. "But what kind of democracy do we have when only a
third of the people vote? If government means by and for the people,
can we really call ourselves a democracy?"</TE>

<HD>Final Rules on Sept. 11 Fund Give Families More Money</HD>
<DH>Victims: Federal special master, responding to pleas, says average
award will grow by $200,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>They did not get all they wanted, but after two months of
politicking and pleading with a federal special master, the families of
the Sept. 11 dead will get more money from a federal Victims'
Compensation Fund than originally proposed.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth Feinberg, the fund's special master, announced Thursday the
final rules that will govern how much relatives will receive to
compensate for economic loss and pain and suffering caused by the
multiple terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 that killed 3,062 people and
injured about 400.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, the new rules will increase by $200,000 the average award
from $1.65 million to $1.85 million--before deductions. And there will be
far fewer deductions, which had caused great concern.</LD>
<TE>   Feinberg conceded that he made many changes in response to a firestorm
of criticism by relatives and their advocates. Over the last weeks, he
met with family groups, members of Congress, trial lawyers and others who
had problems with the draft version of the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "I may not agree with every criticism," he said. "But I wanted today
to assure the families and others . . . that the suggestions have not
fallen on deaf ears."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most contentious elements of the proposed plan was a
$250,000 payment to each family for noneconomic damages. Families were
outraged that this "pain and suffering" award was so low. But Feinberg
did not raise it, although he did raise the amount paid out to each
surviving spouse and each child from $50,000 to $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Push, a spokesman for a group of about 500 families and one of
the most vocal critics of the original rules, was disappointed Thursday
by Feinberg's "few concessions."</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg was appointed by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, and Push insisted
that by not raising the $250,000 noneconomic payment, Feinberg was
revealing the government's ultimate agenda: "The Bush administration
wanted to set a precedent for tort reform that reduces the value of human
life. And they did it. Boy, did they do it."</TE>
<TE>   There was also disappointment that many domestic partners of victims
will still not be eligible to benefit from the fund. Congress mandated
that the fund rules adhere to state laws, and many states, such as New
York, do not recognize these relationships.</TE>
<TE>   But other advocates for the families saw a great improvement in the
rules and an effort on Feinberg's part to do right by the families.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some other things [Feinberg] could have done that would
have been better," said Larry Stewart, president of Trial Lawyers Care, a
group offering free legal advice to families. "But this is progress. I
think it will result in more people getting more. Feinberg was very
motivated to do the very best he could for the victims' families."</TE>
<TE>   Families of high-income earners, firefighters and rescue workers had
been worried that they would get nothing after death benefits, such as
workers' compensation and Social Security, were subtracted from their
claims.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Feinberg said, he decided to eliminate nearly all of the
deductions from claims. But he couldn't drop life insurance payouts and
some pension benefits because that was required in the congressional
statute that created the fund 11 days after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing we can do about that," Feinberg told reporters
Thursday. "Congress has spoken."</TE>
<TE>   The fund, which promised money to those injured or to relatives of
anyone killed, was approved as part of a $15-billion airline bailout. In
return, recipients waived their right to sue.</TE>
<TE>   Among the changes from the proposed rules:</TE>
<TE>   * The deadline for civilians to report injuries to police or medical
officials was increased from 24 to 72 hours from the time of the attack,
and even longer for some rescue workers on a case-by-case basis. Their
compensation will be determined by the nature and extent of their
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   * Special protections were added for families of illegal immigrants
who come forward, Feinberg said, adding that they would not face
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   * Now families can come into the seven processing centers in cities
along the East Coast and go over their particular cases with a trained
advisor to get "a good ballpark estimate," as Feinberg put it, of their
claim before they decide to give up their right to sue.</TE>
<TE>   * Feinberg eliminated the two-hour limit on hearings by claimants who
want to bring their case to the special master. They can now take as long
as they want.</TE>
<TE>   * The new rules also explicitly say there are no caps on the awards.
Feinberg has said each family will get at least $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg said Thursday he still believes the ultimate cost to
taxpayers of the fund will be about $6 billion--the same as his original
estimate. He figured that, even though each person filing a claim would
get substantially more money, the ultimate number of victims--living and
dead--has decreased dramatically since the first estimate was made.</TE>
<TE>   The question that now looms is how many people will go for the fund
rather than file civil court claims.</TE>
<TE>   As of Wednesday, an estimated 366 people have agreed to take part in
the program, a Justice Department spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Stewart and other trial attorneys have been predicting that most
people would have to seek assistance through the fund because of
liability caps protecting the airlines from litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Feinberg argued Thursday that the fund is superior
to litigation because victims cannot be guaranteed that they will get any
money at all through the courts and because the $6-billion cap on airline
liabilities can be split among a wide variety of claims, including
bankrupted businesses and damaged buildings, particularly in New York. It
could leave little for the victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomorrow morning, I hope the families rush into the centers and begin
processing their claims," Feinberg said. "I believe the program is much
better because of their input."</TE>
<TE>   His biggest concern, Feinberg said, is that there are potentially
hundreds of people who were so traumatized by the terrorist attacks that
they don't even know that the fund exists or that they are eligible.</TE>
<TE>   "We must reach these people," Feinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   To do so, Justice Department officials and others will mount a
campaign to notify potential victims and their families through newspaper
and Internet advertisements and other means.</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg criticized those who have labeled the families as "greedy"
for seeking the funds:</TE>
<TE>   "As I've said repeatedly, I think that criticism is definitely
unwarranted. I do not believe it has anything to do with personal greed.
I believe it has everything to do with valuing a lost loved one."</TE>

<HD>House Passes Scaled-Down Stimulus Bill</HD>
<DH>Economy: Measure, which ends months of partisan wrangling, is
approved, 417 to 3. It offers new jobless aid and business tax breaks. A
Senate OK is likely today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>After months of fruitless partisan bickering, the House on Thursday
overwhelmingly approved a stripped-down bill to bolster the economy by
providing new unemployment benefits and modest business tax breaks,
including one eagerly sought by the high-technology industry.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to pass the bill today,
and President Bush said he would sign it.</LD>
<LD>   Congressional debate over how to strengthen the economy has raged for
so long that it may have outlasted the recession. Shortly before the
House vote, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave Congress an
upbeat assessment of the economy, saying, "An economic expansion is
already underway."</LD>
<TE>   Greenspan also said: "I doubt very much that the economy, if it didn't
get a stimulus, would sag."</TE>
<TE>   But House Ways and Means Committee Chairman William M. Thomas
(R-Bakersfield) said: "It may not help a whole lot, but it will not
hurt."</TE>
<TE>   The 417-3 vote in the House broke an impasse over economic policy, as
Republicans backed down from the more controversial tax cuts that
President Bush sought to spur job creation. Democrats agreed to accept
more limited benefits for the unemployed than they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly six months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks hurt an already
struggling economy, pressure has mounted for Congress to move ahead with
the short list of anti-recession measures that both parties embrace.</TE>
<TE>   Bush quickly praised Thursday's House action, even though the
compromise bill leaves out some of his tax-cutting priorities. "We've had
too much non-movement on this important issue. And it's time to go. Time
to get a bill," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last game in town," Thomas said as he pushed for the
bill's passage. "We all play today or we go home to our constituents and
say we did nothing to help you because we let politics matter more than
your economic future."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would pump $51 billion into the economy this year, $43
billion in 2003 and $29 billion in 2004, congressional analysts say.
Those are relatively small amounts in an economy that produces about
$10.2 trillion in goods and services annually.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise measure would allow jobless people who exhaust their 26
weeks of unemployment benefits to get 13 more weeks of aid--and even more
in California and other states with especially high unemployment. The
bill's business tax breaks aim to encourage investment in equipment and
software, a boon to the high-tech industry, which is still suffering even
as much of the rest of the economy improves.</TE>
<TE>   The belated action on the economic stimulus bill underscores how hard
it is for a narrowly and bitterly divided Congress to agree on major
policy matters.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress is not known for being ahead of the curve on any issue,"
said Rep. Rob Portman (R-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   In past recessions, Congress passed extensions of unemployment
benefits with relatively little controversy. But the debate on the
anti-recession proposals that emerged after Sept. 11 became particularly
contentious because it got swept up in jockeying to define the parties'
differences as the November elections approach.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and most Republicans gave priority to cutting taxes to put more
money in the hands of consumers and businesses; Democrats were more
concerned about providing aid to the unemployed. The
Republican-controlled House passed several versions of its stimulus plan
in recent months; the Senate deadlocked and managed to pass only a simple
extension of unemployment benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The impasse was broken when House GOP leaders this week decided to add
only the least controversial tax cuts to the Senate's unemployment
benefits bill.</TE>
<TE>   Jettisoned from the House measure was Bush's proposal to speed
implementation of the cut in income tax rates that was approved last
year. Also dropped were GOP proposals to repeal a tax on corporations
known as the alternative minimum tax and proposals to provide tax credits
to help the unemployed buy health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   More surprising, the bill dropped a popular but costly provision that
had enjoyed broad bipartisan support: payments to mostly lower-income
people who did not receive income tax rebates as a result of the tax cut
enacted last year.</TE>
<TE>   For the jobless, the bill would allow the additional 13 weeks of
benefits for anyone who exhausted their regular benefits after Sept. 11.
Those losing a job through the end of this year would be eligible for the
extended benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would allow another 13-week extension of benefits in
states where unemployment is higher than 4%. California's unemployment
rate was 6.2% in January. According to the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, an estimated 303,000 people in California will run out of
their regular unemployment benefits in the first half of 2002. The center
estimates that 153,000 people in California already exhausted their
benefits from Sept. 11 to Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   The extra benefits would total an estimated $8.5 billion this year and
$4.8 billion in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Of the few tax cuts retained in the compromise, the most significant
was the one sought by the high-technology lobby: a three-year provision
to make it easier for business to write off the cost of buying equipment,
software and other capital assets. The bill allows businesses to
immediately write off 30% of new capital investments.</TE>
<TE>   Computer companies and other high-tech interests made that a priority
because they hope to boost demand for computers and other electronic
equipment by allowing purchasers to write off a larger share of the cost
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "We're delighted with the action taken by the House," said Ralph
Hellmann, lobbyist for the Information Technology Industry Council. "It's
going to be very good for the high-tech industry, which is still bumping
along and hoping to regain the strength it had in the 1990s."</TE>
<TE>   That tax break is worth an estimated $32 billion in 2003 alone,
according to congressional analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would extend a raft of tax breaks that expired at the
end of 2001--including one for employers who hire welfare recipients and
another for financial companies with overseas income. And it includes $5
billion in tax incentives over 10 years to help New York recover from the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats welcomed the compromise but complained that it took
Republicans too long to arrive at it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a hardheaded lot we have here in the House leadership," said
House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   "They are always out of step with everybody else on what is moderate
and sensible and reasonable to do."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans blamed the intransigence of Senate Democrats who blocked
the several versions of the broader bill passed by the House.</TE>

<HD>Much Drama Leading Up to Actors Guild Revote</HD>
<DH>Labor: Rematch between SAG's Melissa Gilbert and Valerie Harper
caps five months of mudslinging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The plot features backbiting, conspiracy theories, accusations of
cronyism, lies and corruption, even one celebrity calling another "a
slug."</LD>
<LD>   All the makings of a good Hollywood drama, maybe even a prime-time
soap. But this bit of reality TV comes to you via the Screen Actors
Guild, Hollywood's biggest and most dysfunctional labor guild. Today, for
the second time in five months, it will select a new president.</LD>
<LD>   After failing once, the 98,000-member guild is expected to announce
tonight that the winner is either Melissa Gilbert, best known as Laura
Ingalls on the 1970s hit "Little House on the Prairie," or Valerie
Harper, Rhoda Morgenstern of the 1970s hit "Rhoda."</LD>
<TE>   Gilbert, 37, won last fall's nullified election. Harper, 61, finished
second in a field of four candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert is a moderate who believes SAG can serve its membership
through measured negotiations with studios, advertisers and agents.
Harper represents a more confrontational philosophy that supported a
six-month strike against advertisers in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   They lead sharply divided factions within SAG that have been warring
for nearly three years. Whoever wins takes office immediately and will
represent the union Sunday night during the Screen Actors Guild Awards
ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium, which will be televised on cable
channel TNT.</TE>
<TE>   More important, the winner will lead a union whose members chronically
face rejection and sometimes aim their frustrations at each other over
issues ranging from runaway productions to facing off against powerful
media conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   The vote also could be a bellwether of where the membership stands on
a proposed agreement to give agents greater freedom to link up
financially with companies that employ actors.</TE>
<TE>   At a 69-year-old union in which members still debate whether one of
its former presidents, Ronald Reagan, sold out the guild in a strike 42
years ago, fighting often has been the norm. David Prindle, a University
of Texas professor who wrote "The Politics of Glamour," a history of SAG,
said other periods of fighting occurred "in the 1930s, the 1940s, the
1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s and in the 1990s."</TE>
<TE>   But few veterans recall a time when the bitterness was so public and
so lengthy, exacerbated by the use of vitriolic e-mails, faxes and Web
sites where there are seemingly no rules when it comes to trashing
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past there may have been a lot of mix-ups, screaming and
hollering," former SAG President Charlton Heston said. "But then it
tended to stay within the place. What I find here is deeply disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   The catalyst for the latest round of fighting came in January, when a
SAG committee headed by actor Fred Savage upheld an appeal by Harper and
others to scrap the last election. Savage's committee cited two
irregularities: There was no signature line on ballot envelopes sent to
New York members and they had two additional days to vote. Also required
to run again are two members of Harper's ticket who won--Treasurer Kent
McCord and Recording Secretary Elliott Gould.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert supporters fired back, calling the action a coup by a
committee packed with Harper supporters that will cost the financially
strapped union more than $100,000 to rerun the vote. They noted that the
violations were minor and Gilbert would have won anyway. They also asked
the Department of Labor to overturn the decision. The agency is
investigating the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a verbal free-for-all that has become one of
Hollywood's most entertaining sideshows.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert supporters, for example, disparagingly dub Harper supporters
"Val's Pals" and "The Refuse to Lose Ticket."</TE>
<TE>   A mass fax from Harper's side suggested that Gilbert and her team
would "sell out this union at the bargaining table," citing a famous line
from a classic film to galvanize support. "Picture Alec Guinness in 'The
Bridge on the River Kwai' lamenting 'What have I done?' " the fax read.</TE>
<TE>   That prompted Oscar-nominated actor James Cromwell, star of "Babe" and
"L.A. Confidential," to dash off an angry letter to Harper.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's deplorable that you've turned this election into a cat
fight," Cromwell wrote. "Rather than Col. Nicolson's lament, 'What have I
done?' I am reminded of Joseph Welch's reply to Sen. McCarthy, 'Sir, have
you no shame?' "</TE>
<TE>   Emmy-winning actress Jane Kaczmarek, star of "Malcolm in the Middle,"
was so upset at receiving a Harper fax on a phone line that she and her
husband, "West Wing" star Bradley Whitford, keep private that she has
demanded an invasion of privacy investigation by SAG officials.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the chief actors in the drama haven't received this kind of
ink in years, and at times the lineup seems as if it came from an evening
of Nick at Nite.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Gilbert and Harper (who can still be seen on reruns of
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show"), there's Savage, who played Kevin Arnold on
"The Wonder Years" and McCord, who in the late 1960s starred as Officer
Jim Reed on "Adam-12."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest dust-up came last month between two actors who have known
each other for years. Both appeared in "MASH," one in the movie, the
other in the TV show.</TE>
<TE>   Harper partisan Gould, 63, played "Trapper" John McIntyre in the film
version, while Gilbert supporter Mike Farrell, 63, starred in the TV
version as Capt. B.J. Hunnicut.</TE>
<TE>   Gould called Farrell "a slug" during a rally at a Los Angeles theater.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bizarre. What was I to say to a thing like that?" Farrell said
in an interview this week.</TE>
<TE>   Farrell said he was on the verge of sending Gould an order of escargot
from a restaurant when he had second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who have reduced this contest to such an ugly and personal
level are going to have to take responsibility for it in one of two
ways," Farrell said of Harper's camp. "Either they win as a result of
these . . . tactics and try to run a union that is splintered and
bloodied, or they lose and try to figure out a way to work with people
trying to make things run reasonably well."</TE>
<TE>   Gould, who is running for recording secretary, offers no apologies,
saying he has generally stayed above the name calling.</TE>
<TE>   "My only misstep was likening Mr. Farrell to a slug. I likened him to
another creature," Gould said.</TE>
<TE>   Gould said he was responding to an e-mail Farrell sent SAG members
criticizing the scrapping of the election results.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he's been fair, and I don't think he's been correct and
I don't think he's been right," Gould said.</TE>
<TE>   Heston, SAG's president in the 1960s, had his own highly public feud
in the early 1980s with then-SAG President Ed Asner over the union's
political activities. Heston said he is hopeful the latest feuds will
eventually subside when actors recognize they have common problems to
solve.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not to say it can't get much worse than it is now," Heston
said. "Things certainly will go back and forth with screaming and
hollering. But you can survive that, and I know we will."</TE>

<HD>'Burbs to L.A.: Goodbye!</HD>
<DH>In the sweepstakes for economic growth and well-paying jobs,
surrounding areas leave Southern California's core county far behind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the economy were a game show, Southern California's counties
might turn to Los Angeles and say: "You are the weakest link."</LD>
<LD>   In the business world, though, there is no bullying master of
ceremonies to pronounce judgment. Instead, statistics tell the story: The
L.A. core has been losing its middle class and providing fewer
opportunities for its poor, low-skilled residents. Neighboring counties
are gaining good-paying jobs and attracting growth industries such as
high technology.</LD>
<LD>   Despite record job creation across the state and country in the late
1990s, Los Angeles County had 76,900 fewer jobs at the end of last year
than it did when employment peaked in December 1989. The county's
unemployment rate stands at 6.3%, far higher than in Orange and San Diego
counties, where joblessness is less than 4%.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles County also has the lowest family income and worst poverty
among all the urban counties in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   That pattern of uneven development might worsen the already severe
strain on schools, hospitals and other government services in the heart
of Southern California. It probably means increasing separation of the
poor, mainly Latino immigrants from the middle class. And if Los Angeles
stops feeding companies, business services and educated workers to
outlying counties, it eventually could hurt economic growth throughout
the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We're reaching a critical juncture now in that many of the growth
areas of Southern California are becoming more mature themselves. Without
a solid core, it begins to harm their long-term economic development
potential," said Ross C. DeVol, director of regional studies for the
Santa Monica-based Milken Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The county's economic problems have been masked somewhat by the strong
recovery that Southern California as a whole made from its devastating
downturn in the early 1990s. The region in the last year suffered only a
minor slump while the Bay Area, and much of the country, struggled.</TE>
<TE>   But the best economic news in Southern California is coming from
outside Los Angeles. Many of the region's biggest public companies,
including some of its brightest high-tech stars, are headquartered in
Orange, San Diego or Ventura counties. Manufacturing and distribution
businesses have flocked to the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, what's happened in Los Angeles is part of a historical
pattern that has occurred in other aging metropolitan areas. Wide-open
spaces for development have become scarce, and existing buildings often
are unsuitable for new, higher-tech industry or, for that matter,
low-tech factories and warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, in the meantime, has not managed to develop a vibrant
financial services industry or enough other thriving sectors to replace
the companies being driven out by high costs and congestion.</TE>
<TE>   "Big cities such as New York and Chicago have moved farther along in
the transformational change," DeVol said.</TE>
<TE>   Given Los Angeles' shortage of developable land, the low skills of
much of its work force and long-term problems with red tape in city
government, the prospects for radically transforming Southern
California's core any time soon appear dim. The recent Kosmont Cost of
Doing Business Survey, which tracks the municipal burdens placed on
companies in Southern California, once again ranked Los Angeles as the
most expensive city in Southern California for business.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is moving in the right direction, and faster than ever before,"
said Larry Kosmont, president of the Kosmont Cos. real estate consulting
organization, which sponsors the survey. "But because it has the highest
business tax rate in the Southland, it has not been able to move quickly
enough or far enough to keep more nimble neighbors from luring firms
away."</TE>
<TE>   High-technology companies, though still abundant in Los Angeles
County, increasingly are flourishing and producing jobs in the region's
outlying areas.</TE>
<TE>   After looking around Southern California, Baxter BioScience Corp. last
year decided to move its headquarters and 350 employees from Glendale to
Westlake Village in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter spokeswoman Tali Kaplan said the company had run out of room in
Glendale and chose Ventura County with an eye toward the future. With
2001 sales topping $2 billion and plans to reach $10 billion by 2010,
Baxter BioScience needed a location that could grow with the company,
Kaplan said. Ventura County "is somewhat rural, and it has a nice quality
of life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan said Ventura County officials have been helpful, reflecting
their long-standing desire to build a critical mass of high-paying
bioscience jobs in a county that already boasts industry giant Amgen Inc.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego, like Los Angeles, was hammered by crushing losses in
aerospace jobs in the early 1990s that saw tens of thousands of
high-paying jobs evaporate. But a concerted effort by business
organizations, public officials and university leaders to foster
high-tech employment has helped turn San Diego into a hotbed for
technology entrepreneurship.</TE>
<TE>   The rebuilding effort required leaders in San Diego County's 18 cities
as well as county government to buy into a shared vision for its future,
said Marney Cox, chief economist with the San Diego Assn. of Governments.
He doesn't envy the task facing Los Angeles County, with its 88 cities
and 10 million people.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just much more difficult to get consensus in Los Angeles because
of the sheer magnitude of its size," Cox said. "Sometimes big is not good
when it comes to getting consensus on moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   Just three technology clusters--communications,
biotechnology-pharmaceuticals and software-computer services--have
replaced all the jobs lost in defense manufacturing in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian entrepreneur Dan Plashkes chose San Diego instead of Los
Angeles, home of his beloved Dodgers, when it came time to set up his
customer service software business.</TE>
<TE>   "The business community here is very focused on [information
technology], it's easy to move around, the quality of labor is good, and
it's a beautiful place to live," said Plashkes, president and chief
executive of eAssist Global Solutions. "San Diego is a growth area. It's
a place for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Although Plashkes remains a big fan of Los Angeles and visits the city
regularly--particularly during baseball season--others don't share his
enthusiasm. Images linger of Los Angeles as a place of high crime, civil
unrest, lousy municipal services, poor immigrants and crumbling schools.</TE>
<TE>   The high home values in Los Angeles would seem to be a sign of
economic strength. But it is more an indication of a lack of residential
construction that has created a housing shortage. Although that may be
good news for existing homeowners, it means hardship for consumers
looking to buy a house for the first time, as well as for apartment
dwellers paying ever-escalating rents.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the surrounding counties face the same challenges as Los
Angeles County in dealing with traffic, air quality and a growing base of
unskilled workers. Likewise, it is not all doom and gloom for Los
Angeles. The county in the last decade has enjoyed expansion in the
entertainment industry, foreign trade and some tech fields.</TE>
<TE>   Strong pockets of vitality extend from the South Bay to Century City
to the Santa Clarita Valley. Los Angeles' income levels, by some
measures, remain higher than those in the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the
California Economy, said Los Angeles' assets--including its large labor
pool, its ports and its key location on the Pacific Rim--someday will
foster a long-term recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to see Los Angeles, amid the overall prosperity of the
region, not doing fairly well itself," Levy said. "The older areas are a
more difficult challenge, and the recovery there won't happen in the next
year. But we're in a recycling mode that will eventually recognize the
locational value of the older areas and put new activities there." The
land and the location are valuable, he said, noting: "It was valuable 50
years ago, and it's valuable now."</TE>
<TE>   Still, in 2000--a boom year for job creation in California--Los
Angeles County ranked last in employment growth among the state's eight
largest metro areas. Last year, when the national and state economies
sank into recession, San Diego County and four counties surrounding Los
Angeles managed to gain a collective 69,600 jobs. By contrast, the latest
statistics show L.A. losing 31,300 jobs in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The growth spurt is over for Los Angeles, and it's not going to catch
up," said Mark Schniepp, director of the California Economic Forecast
Project in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Development experts say one of the principal obstacles to Los Angeles'
economic growth is a shortage of developable land.</TE>
<TE>   "Our underlying problem is very simple. We're out of sites," said
Barry R. Sedlik, chief operating officer of the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Volkswagen of America Inc. last year ditched a cramped low-slung
building in the City of Industry for a new 343,000-square-foot facility
in Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Not only was space cheaper at the Inland Empire site, but the new
location has given the company a competitive advantage over its old
quarters in Los Angeles County, said Eric Johnston, Volkswagen's
executive director of service and parts. Now just minutes from its air
cargo haulers at Ontario International Airport, VW can accept later
orders for next-day delivery.</TE>
<TE>   The migration of factories and warehouses to the Inland Empire, while
bringing pollution and congestion problems, also has fostered other kinds
of business development. A case in point: More homes now are built every
year in the Inland Empire counties of Riverside and San Bernardino than
in much more populous Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' growing weakness since the 1980s also has been aggravated
by the loss of the headquarters of big companies that once not only
pumped dollars into the economy but also provided philanthropy and
community leadership. The departures included such giants as Arco,
Lockheed and the First Interstate and Security Pacific banking
organizations, companies that aren't easily replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a generation to create companies like that," said Russell
Goldsmith, chief executive of Beverly Hills-based City National Bank.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, though Los Angeles is blessed with major research
universities such as UCLA, USC and Caltech, they traditionally have not
spawned nearby high-tech businesses to the extent UC San Diego and UC
Irvine have.</TE>
<TE>   The businesses they have sparked often wind up outside of Los Angeles.
For instance, UCLA-affiliated scientists helped launch Ventura
County-based Amgen, the nation's biggest biotech company, and Broadcom, a
leading telecommunications chip maker in Orange County. "UCLA made no
effort to keep those guys in Westwood," Goldsmith said.</TE>
<TE>   All told, economic gauges often put Los Angeles County at the bottom
among Southern California counties. One of the grimmest indicators is
family income. In 1999, the most recently reported year for that measure,
Los Angeles' median family income was $44,784, lower than that of any of
the surrounding counties or San Diego. Ten years earlier, Los Angeles
ranked fourth among the six counties.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Reed, an economist at the Public Policy Institute of
California, cautions against viewing low incomes and high poverty as
signs that L.A. County's economy is an overwhelming failure.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, she said, those indicators signal that the county is
attracting lots of immigrant laborers eager to improve their economic lot
but who lack the skills to move into stable, well-paying employment. Many
wind up taking jobs that are low paying by U.S. standards but that still
provide an entry into the American work force.</TE>
<TE>   Still, such workers' movement up the economic ladder is limited. An
analysis by the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute found that 1
in 10 adults in Los Angeles County has six years of education or less.
The rate is the worst among all U.S. metropolitan areas and is more than
double the rate of San Francisco and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Improving the skills of these minimally educated workers presents a
huge challenge. Because many are undocumented, they are ineligible for
publicly funded training programs. Legislators have largely sidestepped
the issue to avoid the hot-button topic of illegal immigration. But
experts such as Linda Wong, work force development director for the Los
Angeles-based Community Development Technologies Center, say doing
nothing will continue to take a heavy toll on the Los Angeles economy for
years to come.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is already a bifurcated society, and that gap is only
going to continue to grow," Wong said. "It's not good for our local
economy, our standard of living or our quality of life."</TE>

<HD>Anna Nicole Smith Wins $89-Million Judgment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge awarded former Playboy centerfold Anna Nicole Smith
nearly $89 million of her late husband's estate Thursday, finding that
she truly loved the 90-year-old Texas oil tycoon even though his fortune
was the "central facet" of their romance.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling culminates a legal soap opera that has bounced between
courts in California and Texas for six years, a tale of sex, money and a
dysfunctional Houston oil family that has been a staple for supermarket
tabloids and late-night comedians.</LD>
<LD>   The case centered on the former stripper's claim that her husband, J.
Howard Marshall, promised to leave her half his fortune and on whether
Marshall's son tried to swindle her out of it.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge David O. Carter agreed with Smith, now 34, to a
point. He ruled that she was entitled to half of the investment income
Marshall earned during their brief marriage, plus $44 million in punitive
damages because of her stepson's "willful, malicious" plot to deceive
her.</TE>
<TE>   The total comes to about 8% of Marshall's fortune. The rest goes to
his son, Pierce Marshall, who has taken to calling his stepmother "Miss
Cleavage." Marshall has vowed to continue the fight all the way to the
U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>'Lives . . . Driven by Greed and Lust'</TE>
<TE>   The monthlong appeals case delved into the intricacies of estate law.
But in the end, the judge focused on matters of the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a 63-year age gap, Carter concluded that the romance between
the Texas oilman and the pinup was real, giving credibility to Smith's
claim.</TE>
<TE>   "Their lives were intertwined in need, driven by greed and lust.
Nevertheless, the court is convinced of his love for her. J. Howard
referred to [Smith] as the 'light of my life' and the lady [who] saved
his life," Carter wrote in his opinion. "The court is more cautious about
her love for him. . . . J. Howard used his money to get [Smith] to fall
in love with him, and in her own way, [she] loved J. Howard."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Carter appeared disturbed by what he described as Smith's
selfishness, greed and exaggerated portrayal of herself as an innocent,
helpless victim.</TE>
<TE>   "While she detested being thought of as a gold-digger, her actions
leave little doubt that money was the central facet of her relationship
with J. Howard. Her appetite for money, once developed, was incessant and
outlandish by everyday standards," the judge wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's inability to grasp the facts while on the stand was striking,
the judge noted.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the trial, Carter asked a lethargic Smith if she
was on medication. "Not at this time," she said, adding that she had
recently stopped using antidepressants.</TE>
<TE>   When asked her date of birth, Smith hesitated. When asked to explain
how she mistakenly listed a $4,800 diamond to be worth $48,000, Smith
told the court "I'm not too good on zeros."</TE>
<TE>   Smith met Marshall in 1991 when she was dancing at GiGi's, a Houston
strip club. Marshall went at the behest of his chauffeur, who wanted to
save the oil tycoon from the deep depression he had fallen into when both
Marshall's wife and mistress died within a few months of one another,
according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   On June 27, 1994, the day Smith married the man she called "Paw Paw,"
J. Howard Marshall was 89 years old. Smith was 26. She wore a
white-beaded gown. He wore a white tuxedo as he slipped a 22-carat
diamond onto her finger.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall died 14 months later.</TE>
<TE>   His son, Pierce, was not on the wedding guest list, a coincidence that
didn't escape the judge when he assessed Pierce's relationship with both
his father and new stepmother.</TE>
<TE>   Carter ruled that Smith's stepson lied, falsified documents and
tricked his own father in an attempt to rob Smith of any share of J.
Howard Marshall's estimated $780-million fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence of willfulness, maliciousness, and fraud is
overwhelming," Carter wrote. He found that Pierce and one of his father's
legal advisors engaged in a pattern of deceiving the elder Marshall for
nearly two years--making sure he had no control over his money.</TE>
<TE>   "They presented documents under pretenses, suborned perjured notary
oaths, falsified and backdated documents, and altered documents, all with
the intent of denying [Smith] the gift that J. Howard intended to make to
her," the judge concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Carter recommended that federal prosecutors investigate his findings
of perjury in the case, and also called on the Internal Revenue Service
to take a closer look at tax deductions made on J. Howard Marshall's
behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who was not present in the Santa Ana courtroom, said in a
statement that she felt victorious and vindicated.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very happy, particularly that the judge found her testimony so
credible," said her attorney, Philip W. Boesch of Los Angeles. "This is
all about what Howard Marshall the man wanted. He loved his wife. . . .
This is really a victory for the love a husband had for his wife, and the
fact that love has no age limits."</TE>
<TE>   The response from Pierce Marshall was swift. He said his late father
"would be appalled [that the court] continued to ignore his clearly
stated wishes."</TE>
<TE>   "My father recognized that Anna Nicole would never be a partner or
companion and that she would blow every cent he gave her. He told
confidants that the marriage had been a mistake," Pierce Marshall said in
a written statement.</TE>
<TE>Previous $475-Million Judgment Overturned</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a bankruptcy judge in Los Angeles sided with Smith in the
case, and awarded her $475 million. Six months later, a Texas probate
court sided with the younger Marshall, declaring him the sole heir.</TE>
<TE>   The case eventually fell to Carter. He agreed to review the bankruptcy
case, throwing out Smith's $475-million judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Carter released his decision Thursday morning to a courtroom filled
with journalists and lawyers but not the plaintiff or defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Eisenberg of Los Angeles, one of Pierce Marshall's attorneys in
the case, said he was astonished by Carter's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "The facts, the documents, the history don't support any claim that
she has," Eisenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith now lives in Los Angeles and has been supporting herself in part
by modeling plus-size lingerie for Lane Bryant stores.</TE>

<HD>Prosperity Hasn't Been Trickling Down</HD>

Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Korean-owned supermarkets in Los Angeles have prospered for years,
most notably in the large ethnic community of Koreatown. But this
prosperity has not trickled down to the immigrant workers who form
the backbone of their economic success.</LD>
<LD>   In early January, workers at one of the largest of these markets
gained a major victory when the National Labor Relations Board set a
vote on unionization for Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   These are not the mom-and-pop grocery stores.</LD>
<TE>   For example, seven Koreatown supermarkets employ on average 80 to
100 workers per store. Each has a sales volume comparable to and in
some instances exceeding that of the Ralphs and Vons in the same
area.</TE>
<TE>   The Korean-owned supermarkets serve as an example of how immigrant
communities and businesses thrive and contribute to the economy of
Los Angeles and California.</TE>
<TE>   However, unlike workers at major supermarket chains in Los
Angeles, workers at the Korean supermarkets have no union protection,
which would allow for collective bargaining to negotiate fair wages,
health benefits and job security.</TE>
<TE>   These mostly Latino and Korean workers have been subjected to
verbal and psychological abuse and threatened with termination and
deportation when they have tried to organize to demand fair
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   These workers receive a wage increase only when state law mandates
an increase in the minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   They receive no health benefits, vacation time or sick time. They
toil under sweatshop-like conditions for years, while also training
other workers, and yet earn no more than the minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   At unionized supermarkets throughout Los Angeles, workers earn up
to $15 per hour and receive benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The income generated by Korean supermarkets indicates that they
are more than able to support their employees under union contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Korean supermarkets do not operate in a vacuum. The actions of
their owners have dire consequences for Los Angeles. Their labor
practices and those in other industries have contributed to the rise
in the number of working poor in Los Angeles over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   A 2000 Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy study found that,
over the last decade, the ranks of the working poor grew by 34%.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, more than 60% of the working poor in Los Angeles
are immigrants, the majority of them Latino. More than 90% of the
workers at Korean supermarkets are immigrants, with the majority of
them from the Latino community.</TE>
<TE>   The growth in the number of working poor can be tied to the lack
of unionization among immigrant workers.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 study also found that unionization rates among the
working poor of Los Angeles are significantly lower than in other
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, Korean and Latino workers at Assi supermarket in
Koreatown presented their demands for union recognition to owner
Daniel Lee. Lee has retained a high-priced national employment law
firm that is known for challenging workers' attempts to form unions.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of paying so much money to lawyers, Daniel Lee should be
investing that money in paying living wages and health benefits. And
he should allow his workers to unionize.</TE>
<TE>   Lee and the self-described "union avoidance" law firm he hired
have conducted an anti-union campaign to discourage the workers from
supporting the union on election day.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of more than 50 organizations has come together to
support these workers and their efforts to organize a union.</TE>
<TE>   With the Saturday union vote, it is more critical than ever to
come together as a community to support these courageous Korean and
Latino workers as they risk their jobs to fight for better working
conditions and a better future for their children.</TE>

<HD>We Have a Sacred Covenant With the Dead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS R. COLE</AU>
<BD>Thomas R. Cole is a professor in the Institute for the
Medical Humanities of the University of Texas Medical Branch at
Galveston. He produced a recently released documentary, "Still Life:
The Humanity of Anatomy," which will be screened at film festivals in
April in Newport Beach and Durham, N.C.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As reports keep coming in about bodies decaying in the Georgia woods,
people are shocked, hurt, enraged, confused, mystified.</LD>
<LD>   This is more than an ordinary failure to fulfill contractual
obligations. The scandal exposes the fraying of a sacred covenant
between the living and the dead--a covenant that apparently can no
longer be taken for granted.</LD>
<LD>   We need to renew this covenant, yet it remains a taboo, a secret
hiding place for avoiding the ancient Greek injunction: Know thyself.</LD>
<TE>   We need to remember just how much we the living depend on the dead
and how much the dead rely on the living.</TE>
<TE>   The dead are part of our society--whether we believe it or not and
whether we like it or not. They have claims on us. They hold the
secrets of our past and represent our future.</TE>
<TE>   Why else would Aeneas consult his father in the underworld or
Dante need the guidance of Virgil in "The Divine Comedy" or Hamlet be
motivated by his father's ghost?</TE>
<TE>   The depth and fullness of our humanity can be read from the ways
we relate to those who have gone before us and the ways we treat dead
bodies.</TE>
<TE>   My own experience as a humanist teaching medical students in the
anatomy lab has taught me about these issues. And the news is
encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   The anatomy lab is one of the few places where the living learn
directly and physically from the dead. Cadavers have a great deal
more to teach than yielding up the physical structures of their
bodies.</TE>
<TE>   But we must learn to open our hearts and minds wider to receive
their wisdom. The capacity to imagine and feel the reality of the
unseen is central to a humane sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   Strange as it may seem, the anatomy lab is a perfect place to
cultivate this capacity. The cadaver is a trickster: It looks like a
person, but there's no one there. Yet not long ago, there was. What
do we owe that person?</TE>
<TE>   In my teaching, I try to cut a path through the confusion and
disorientation of this paradox, to help students explore, one step at
a time, the emotional, moral and spiritual landscape of donation and
dissection.</TE>
<TE>   I ask students questions that make them uncomfortable: Was there a
moment when you felt in your heart that this cadaver had once been a
living person? Was there a moment when you realized that someday you
will be as dead as your cadaver? Would you donate your own body?
Imagine that you could talk to the person who donated the body you
are dissecting. What would you want to say to them? What would you
want to know?</TE>
<TE>   In talking with people who will donate their bodies to science, I
ask: What would you like to say to the students who will be
dissecting your body? What would you want them to know about you? Why
did you decide to donate your body? What would constitute disrespect
of your body?</TE>
<TE>   When students reflect on these questions, they are reviving a
much-needed imaginative traffic between the living and the dead.</TE>
<TE>   This is not easy work. But my experience is that wrestling with
these questions helps students grasp the profound gift they have
received, the collaboration they are engaged in across the border of
life and death.</TE>
<TE>   The result is often real growth in compassion and self-knowledge.
When donors reflect on these questions, they may come to value their
death as a final act of trust and service to the future.</TE>
<TE>   This dialogue between donors and dissectors offers a window onto
the larger issues raised in Georgia. The relationship between the
living and the dead is like any other relationship. It withers
without thoughtfulness, caring and acceptance of the vulnerability
inherent in love.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal is not only a matter of unethical business practices;
it involves the violation of a sacred obligation to lay each person
who dies to rest with dignity and in accordance with the wishes and
beliefs of the individual and family.</TE>

<HD>A Nation Ready to Compromise Must Be Ready to Fight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YOSSI KLEIN HALEVI</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is author of "At the Entrance to the
Garden of Eden: A Jew's Search for God With Christians and Muslims in
the Holy Land" (Morrow, 2001).</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Even for those of us living in the belly of the Arab-Jewish war,
attack and counterattack tend to blur into one more awful Middle East
day. It's probably inevitable, then, that outsiders would be tempted
to dismiss this conflict as a bloody tantrum thrown by "both sides."</LD>
<LD>   Yet maintaining clarity about the causes of the latest phase of
the 100-year Middle East war is crucial because what's at stake is
whether terrorist blackmail will be resisted or indulged.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian leaders insist that this is a war of liberation
against occupation, a desperate act of last resort.</LD>
<TE>   But the Palestinian terrorist offensive that began 18 months ago
is a calculated attempt to win additional concessions through
violence rather than negotiation.</TE>
<TE>   It is terrorism as diplomacy by other means. The horror isn't a
struggle for Palestinian freedom but for a few percentage points of
contested territory or worse, a gambit to force Israel back to the
1967 borders without offering reciprocal concessions, such as
accepting the legitimacy of a Jewish state in any borders.</TE>
<TE>   The tragic irony is that a majority of Israelis were ready to
accept almost any territorial concession in exchange for peace--real
peace.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, during the first intifada, many Israelis came to
realize that the occupation was untenable and that the Jews hadn't
returned home after a history of suffering only to oppress another
people. We began a painful reexamination of the history of the Middle
East conflict and gradually conceded that the Palestinians too had a
case.</TE>
<TE>   I learned those lessons as a soldier in Gaza's refugee camps, from
which I emerged convinced, along with many others, that maintaining
the occupation would poison Israel's soul. The result of that
collective awakening was the Oslo process, which Israel itself
initiated.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis swallowed hard and empowered their most brutal enemy,
Yasser Arafat, who'd become a pariah even in the Arab world for his
support of Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War. We desperately wanted
to believe that the arch-terrorist had transformed himself into a
peacemaker because the alternative--that Israel would sink ever
deeper into an endless occupation--seemed unbearable.</TE>
<TE>   The premise of the Oslo process was that Israel would gradually
trade territory for Palestinian promises of peaceful intent--land for
words. The more reassurance the Palestinians could offer, the more
Israelis would feel safe enough to yield additional territory.
Instead, Arafat incited a culture of violence and hatred and death.
Perhaps worst of all, he continued to teach his people that the Jews
were aliens without legitimate claim to any part of the land. And he
did so at a time when Israel's prime minister wasn't Ariel Sharon but
Yitzhak Rabin.</TE>
<TE>   After seven bitter years of Oslo, most Israelis were forced to
concede that we'd been tricked. The result was that a despairing
electorate turned to Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   With the current wave of violence, Arafat has exposed himself as
the same terrorist leader whose Palestinian Liberation Organization
in the 1970s specialized in hijacking airplanes and targeting
schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   His goal is straightforward: to terrorize Israelis into a
unilateral withdrawal from the territories. Some Israelis are
debating whether to respond to Arafat's assault through military
escalation or to accept defeat and yield the contested territories
without a negotiated settlement.</TE>
<TE>   One left-wing Israeli columnist recently wrote that we should
surrender to Arafat's "legitimate demands" and thereby test whether
that "will bring us closer to the end of this conflict." Those
Israelis who oppose fighting this war are right when they insist that
ultimately there is no military solution to the Palestinian problem.
Neither is it worth the bloodletting if the goal is to retain
settlements and biblical territory.</TE>
<TE>   But this isn't a war for settlements but for the inviolate
principle that the Middle East dispute can be resolved only through
negotiations, not suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Withdrawal under fire will only draw greater fire. In the
post-Sept. 11 world, there should be no place for indulging
terrorism, even when it speaks the beguiling language of national
liberation.</TE>
<TE>   It is precisely those of us who believe in reconciliation with the
Palestinians and who are prepared to make the necessary concessions
for real peace who must resist the temptation to surrender to
blackmail. A nation ready to compromise must also be ready to fight.
Otherwise, the longing for peace becomes appeasement of terror.</TE>

<HD>Warning: Soft Money Has Legs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington is a syndicated columnist. E-mail:
arianna @ariannaonline.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite some embarrassing last-minute parliamentary flapdoodle on the
part of the madame at the campaign finance bordello--Sen. Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.)--it is time to write the obituary for the soft
money era.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle has promised to hold an
all-night pajama party to thwart any filibuster, and the signs are
that the president will, reluctantly, sign the campaign finance
reform bill.</LD>
<LD>   In the meantime, politicians from both parties are tripping over
themselves in a desperate stampede to cash in before soft money goes
the way of DDT, Dalkon Shields and the Pinto. The fund-raisers are
revving up their Rolodexes and putting out the call to fat cat donors
across the land: "Gentlemen, start your checkbooks!"</LD>
<TE>   The next few months--the law would take effect Nov. 6--will see a
Neroesque orgy of political fund-raising, featuring money soft, hard
and in between.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the big-buck bacchanal are the president and vice
president, who each are slated to be the main draw at, on average,
two fund-raisers a week--playing more dates than Steve and Eydie.</TE>
<TE>   But the juiciest morsel of bait in the Republican tackle box is
former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who, in a particularly
distasteful example of cashing in on the Sept. 11 attacks, this week
headlined a fund-raiser for House Republicans touted as a "Salute to
America's Heroes." So here is Rudy trading in his Sept. 11 halo for
an enormous deposit in his personal favor bank, which he can cash out
whenever he decides to make his next political move.</TE>
<TE>   To paraphrase Todd Beamer: Let's bankroll!</TE>
<TE>   And while most of the debate on campaign finance reform has
focused on the problem of public policy being sold to the highest
bidder, the exorbitant cost of funding modern campaigns also has led
to an ever-shrinking pool of potential candidates, as fewer and fewer
quality people run for public office. As it stands, only the super
rich or those willing to spend their every waking moment begging for
money from the super rich need apply.</TE>
<TE>   The California gubernatorial primary provides a striking example.
On the Republican side, the race came down to a battle between
self-made millionaire Richard Riordan and trust fund millionaire Bill
Simon.</TE>
<TE>   The victorious Simon will now take on Democratic fund-raising
machine Gray Davis, whose principal achievement in office has been
raising more than $30 million. His almost inevitable reelection will
only make his obsessive-compulsive fund-raising disorder more
contagious.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the ban on soft money is far from the end of the
overwhelming influence of money on our campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Soft money donations made up less than 20% of the nearly $3
billion spent on the last round of federal elections.</TE>
<TE>   And, as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told me after the historic
House vote, "This bill will only thwart the special interests for so
long. Twenty years from now, they will have figured out ways to get
around it, and another couple of senators will be fighting to break
the endless cycle of corruption and reform."</TE>
<TE>   But long before the lobbyists and the lawyers start ferreting out
the new loopholes like pigs snorting for truffles--and it will take a
lot less than 20 years--the question remains: What should be done
next?</TE>
<TE>   Many things. We should immediately fortify the notoriously
toothless Federal Election Commission with some real enforcement
bite.</TE>
<TE>   And we should demand that broadcasters--who, after all, are making
massive profits using the public airwaves--offer political candidates
free TV time.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, the only way to dramatically diminish the
corrupting influence of special-interest money is by adopting the
"Clean Money, Clean Election" model, which replaces the nonstop
money-grab with full public financing of elections.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it: No hard money, no soft money, no endless dialing for
dollars, no quid pro dough deals. Just candidates and elected
officials beholden to no one but the voters.</TE>

<LD>Warren Harding, the American president, was disgraced by the Teapot
Dome financial scandal in the 1920s. But there was a more interesting
Warren Harding, a character and iconoclast of mountainous
proportions. He was a scrawny, bandylegged visionary with wild black
hair and a savage gleam in his eye and one of the nation's pioneering
rock climbers. In 1958, in an event that captured national attention,
he completed the first climb up the 3,000-foot vertical and
overhanging granite nose of El Capitan in Yosemite Valley. The
impossible had been done.</LD>
<LD>   Harding has died at his Shasta County home at the age of 77, a
remarkable longevity for a man who consumed untold quantities of
rotgut red wine and drove fast cars with wild abandon.</LD>
<LD>   The sheer northwest face of Half Dome was climbed in 1957 by
Harding's rival, Royal Robbins. But climbers stood at the foot of El
Cap and gazed up in awe and fear. No one had dared attempt it.
Harding's efforts occurred over a two-year period with the help of a
cast of partners, many of whom dropped out, worn and wasted trying to
keep up with the relentless Harding, no kin to the 29th president.
Now there are scores of climbing routes up El Cap, but the Nose
remains a classic, and Harding's name is indelibly linked to it. In
all, Harding made 30 first ascents and, with Robbins and a handful of
others, made the valley a mecca for the world's best alpinists.</LD>
<TE>   Traditionalists criticized Harding for using siege tactics on El
Cap, establishing a series of camps linked to the ground, much like
an Everest expedition, and using excessive numbers of expansion bolts
to make progress in spaces devoid of cracks and handholds. Harding
didn't care. He called the purists "Valley Christians" and went his
own way, often partnering with Galen Rowell, now a noted mountain
photographer.</TE>
<TE>   Climbing was an absurd pursuit to Harding. He titled his
autobiography "Downward Bound" and founded the Lower Sierra Eating,
Drinking and Farcing Society,  covering a wide range of outrageous
behavior. Others worked out and trained; Harding consumed his red
wine and regaled followers with climbing, car-racing and girl-friend
stories.</TE>
<TE>   Harding made national news again in 1970 with his 27-day ascent of
the Wall of the Early Morning Light on the southeast face of El
Capitan with Dean Caldwell, surviving extremely cold weather and
extreme climbing. When park rangers attempted to rescue the pair,
Harding insisted that the climbers could finish on their own and
threatened to fight the rescuers off with his piton hammer. Reaching
the top, Harding was asked why he climbed it. "Because we're insane,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Warren Harding was a great renegade with an ego to match El
Capitan, the cliff that stands as his memorial.</TE>

<LD>Don't blame the beleaguered voter for the record-low statewide
turnout of 34% of registered voters in Tuesday's primary election.
Don't call the stay-at-homes lazy or berate them for failing to do
their duty. Don't wonder why the patriotism stirred by Sept. 11
didn't translate into an energized electorate.</LD>
<LD>   The truth is, for many Californians, there were just too many
reasons not to vote. The lack of hot contests on the Democratic
ballot resulted in dismal turnouts of 23% in heavily Democratic Los
Angeles County and 27% in San Francisco. The confusing rules of the
primary had been changed again as to who could vote for which slate
of candidates.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign was overshadowed first by the Super Bowl and then by
the Winter Olympic Games. When the political ads finally got the
public's attention, their constant carping and  attacks surely turned
off many voters. On election day some locales, including Los Angeles,
were plagued with the failure of some polling places to open on time,
ballots that weren't delivered and voting locations that were changed
or yanked.</LD>
<TE>   The real culprit, however, was the ridiculously early primary
date, more than eight months before the Nov. 5 general election. Many
Californians didn't even realize an election was coming up.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature and governor should make sure this doesn't happen
again. Lawmakers need to take a close look at SB 1975, by Sen. Ross
Johnson (R-Irvine), a bill that would move the primary for state and
local candidates to the second Tuesday in September every election
year while maintaining a separate presidential primary in March.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to enable California to have a rational primary date
while retaining some clout in the choosing of the presidential
candidates. More discussion is in order about whether September
balloting would allow enough time for an informative general election
campaign. However, nine states have August primaries, and 10,
including New York, vote on the second Tuesday in September, the day
Johnson has proposed. A cheaper proposal would be for the state to
stop playing presidential primary leapfrog for ever-earlier dates and
move all primaries back to June.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials struggle to make it convenient for Californians
to vote, but the process remains complex and confusing. "It felt more
like doing your taxes," one expert said. The first step toward
rationality is getting rid of this March madness.</TE>

<HD>Mugabe: From Hero to Thug</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe used to wait until after he won an
election to turn his thugs loose on political opponents. This time
his party's criminals have been torturing and killing their foes even
though the balloting isn't until this weekend. One difference is that
when Mugabe won in the 1980s, the elections were generally fair
contests. Now the economy is so bad, his regime's corruption so
widespread, foreign assistance so diminished, that he would be in
trouble if he let the nation vote as it chooses. His solution?
Terrorize the opponents.</LD>
<LD>   Mugabe secured his place in history by fighting to free Zimbabwe
from British colonial rule. The struggle made him a hero, a beacon
for all African nations battling for independence. But he has
fiercely held power for more than two decades, with his rule
tarnishing his earlier accomplishments. He was a better freedom
fighter than governor.</LD>
<TE>   Mugabe's rival in the presidential elections Saturday and Sunday
is Morgan Tsvangirai, a former trade union leader. Violence against
members of Tsvangirai's political party, the Movement for Democratic
Change, has killed well over 100 people in the last two years by the
party's count. But the persecution doesn't stop there. Last week the
government charged Tsvangirai with treason for allegedly plotting to
assassinate Mugabe. The government claimed to have a videotape on
which Tsvangirai spoke of having the president "eliminated," but the
charge has been discredited by all but Mugabe's supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Inflation in Zimbabwe is more than 100%, AIDS is a threat to the
country's stability and foreign investment has been crippled by the
government's seizure of white-owned farmlands. Mugabe has barred
American and some other foreign observers from monitoring the
election. His regime changed laws to disenfranchise many expected to
back Tsvangirai. The repression and vote rigging may extend Mugabe's
grip on power, but it threatens to isolate the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The United States last month imposed travel restrictions on Mugabe
and his aides to protest the violent election campaign. The European
Union did the same and took the extra step of freezing overseas
assets of Mugabe and 29 top officials.</TE>
<TE>   If Mugabe steals the election, the more than 50 British
Commonwealth countries--Australia, Lesotho, Nigeria and South Africa
among them--should suspend Zimbabwe's membership. But damage will
already have been done. The president's thuggery could stoke violence
among those who find it impossible to express their dissent
peacefully at the voting booth. The ensuing mayhem would further
disillusion a West that has only belatedly and reluctantly recognized
the urgent need to help Africa battle AIDS and build its economies.</TE>

<HD>Nixon Legacy Both Past and Prologue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was keenly disappointed reading Robert Scheer's March 5 commentary
regarding former President Richard Nixon.</LD>
<LD>   The new tapes simply confirm Nixon's biases. Nixon hated many
people. He disgraced the presidency and, as we all know, was obliged
to resign. For Scheer to beat a dead horse may give pleasure to some,
but we already knew Nixon's character, and he earned his low esteem
among historians. In spite of some achievements, such as opening a
dialogue with China and Russia, his legacy is set in stone.</LD>
<LD>   Likewise, Bill Clinton's character has been established, and his
legacy is at the bottom tier of past presidents. As new revelations
come forward in 20 or 30 years, or sooner, it is hoped that
right-wing opposites of Scheer will not pound away.</LD>
<TE>   Both legacies are established. Let's move on with our lives and
print constructive columns rather than regurgitate the past.</TE>
<TE>   Robert P. Abate</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank goodness for people like Scheer, who remind us that the U.S.
has its share of narrow-minded zealots in powerful positions.</TE>
<TE>   Such a reminder is especially important now, when too many
Americans are prone to be sanctimonious and think evil resides only
in other parts of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Kerkvliet</TE>
<TE>   Canberra, Australia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Well, it happened much sooner than I expected. Neither Scheer nor
Paul Conrad (cartoon, Commentary, March 6) could make any of their
mud attacks stick to Bush, so they've both refocused their liberal
hate on their old standby, a deceased Nixon.</TE>

<HD>Dismissed Priests: Lift the Veil of Secrecy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Mahony Won't Say if Police Got Priests' Names," March 5: As a
Catholic who has seen several priests at local parishes mysteriously
disappear with no explanation other than the reading of some nebulous
letter from the local bishop at a subsequent Mass, I strongly feel
that Cardinal Roger Mahony has a responsibility as the shepherd of
the Catholics in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to tell us Catholics,
and the proper authorities, who these priests are who have been
dismissed.</LD>
<LD>   I want to know if any of them have served at the parishes that I
have attended. I want to know if any of them taught at the Catholic
schools I attended. I want to know when such sad and, I might add,
criminal event(s) occurred. I want to know when the church knew of
the events. I want to know why, in certain instances, the church may
have failed to act on this knowledge and notify the authorities and,
ultimately, inform the laity.</LD>
<LD>   We Catholics place a tremendous trust in the church, but that is
not a blind trust. We need this information for both our physical and
spiritual well being and, more important, for the protection of our
youth. Cardinal Mahony, I remain a loyal Catholic, but I must tell
you that with or without this information, we Catholics will make
decisions--by our feet and by our pocketbooks--on the parishes we
attend and the dioceses we support.</LD>
<TE>   Donald A. Bentley</TE>
<TE>   La Puente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again--and perhaps never more glaringly--does the hypocrisy
of organized religion confound and mystify ("Priest Leaves Sad, Angry
Congregants," March 4). The outrage expressed by some members of the
congregation over Father Michael Pecharich's forced departure because
he "transgressed the personal boundaries of an adolescent" and their
contention that it should have been handled privately only perpetuate
the Roman Catholic veil of secrecy on matters of sexual abuse by
priests.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder, though, if an admitted pedophile were to move next door,
would these same parishioners insist on such reticence? Maybe it
isn't always just the wolf in shepherd's clothing that ravages the
flock.</TE>

<HD>Davis Subverted Republican Primary</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How can The Times blithely condone Gov. Gray Davis' shameless,
cynical subversion of the Republican gubernatorial primary ("Simon's
Turnabout," editorial, March 6)? Davis spent a reported $10 million
on sleazy attack advertising against Richard Riordan. The only
purpose was to smear him for changing his position on abortion and
other issues that have nothing to do with the responsibilities of the
governor. In effect, you're critiquing Riordan for not being
sufficiently sneaky and sleazy when you should be condemning Davis'
actions as completely unethical and immoral.</LD>
<LD>   As a lifelong Democrat, I am ashamed. When the governor of
California can directly subvert another party's primary, then the
time for election reform is overdue. If I, as a Democrat, am not
allowed to vote in a Republican primary, then I sure as hell should
not be allowed to buy the outcome!</LD>
<LD>   Davis needs to be voted out of office. We can live with weak and
ineffectual leaders but should not tolerate anyone so malicious,
cynical and contemptuous of the electoral process.</LD>

<TE>   Who besides me was so utterly appalled in reading "Davis' Brash
Tactician Grabs National Notice" (March 6), about the governor's
attack dog Garry South? Even worse was the admiration that greeted
his obnoxious strategy on behalf of his boss, the perpetual promotion
machine.</TE>
<TE>   The last Republican I voted for was Earl Warren, so I am not about
to endorse the antediluvian policies of Bill Simon. And neither can I
support the gutless policies of the present state administration, so
I guess I'll sit this next one out.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Hillman</TE>

<TE>   The Republican nomination of Simon for governor is better
understood when you realize that if you send a Democrat to run
against a Democrat, you end up with a Democrat, and that was the
problem in the first place.</TE>

<LD>The L.A. County registrar-recorder sent absentee ballots to
nonpartisan voters without instructions on how to vote in the
Democratic, Republican, American Independent or Reform parties. The
possibility of a nonpartisan voter voting in these party primaries
was not mentioned in the mailed information. To vote for Richard
Riordan for Republican gubernatorial candidate I had to go to a
polling place to find out what ballot chad to punch. Probably many
nonpartisan absentee voters were thus partly disenfranchised.</LD>
<LD>   As there is no political party to represent the rights of
nonpartisan voters, the L.A. County registrar-recorder must do a
better job as an advocate for nonpartisan voters.</LD>

Angeles City Council District 2, where Wendy Greuel apparently won by
just 55 votes out of more than 26,000 cast. The undisputed winner was
the city of La Habra's Proposition II. It passed by 5 votes out of
7,883 cast; a margin of victory of 0.063%.</TE>

<LD>Re "In Jolt to Orange County, Navy to Sell El Toro Land," March 7:
What a hoot! One day after the election the Navy decides to sell El
Toro Marine base. Thanks to all of you who voted for the "Quality of
Life Initiative" and turned what should have been a countywide asset
into a developer--and the city of Irvine--boondoggle. Be sure to let
us all know how your quality of life is after El Toro and the
surrounding 14,000 acres are developed. You will have plenty of time
to think about this while sitting in all the additional traffic the
new developments will bring.</LD>

<TE>   Since when is El Toro the "property" of the U.S. Navy, to sell to
the highest bidder? I thought the people of the U.S. owned that and
all federal property; more specifically, the conservative Bushies
should be appalled at the idea of a federal entity selling land that
rightly belongs to the state of California when the feds relinquish
it. But wait a minute: California elected Al Gore in '00! Now I get
it. They want to sell it to a coal power plant or maybe a steel
mill--whatever is the most obnoxious.</TE>

<TE>   Well, the people have spoken. Orange County lacks significant
noncommercial open space, the U.S. government has a large parcel of
land that taxpayers have strongly indicated (again and again) they do
not want used as an airport. Days ago, the people indicated that they
want this public land to be used as a public park. Now we find that
the U.S. Navy wants to subvert the will of the citizenry to benefit a
handful of local private developers. This is democratic? Nice job,
U.S. military!</TE>

<TE>   The NIMBY Orange County voters decided to congest our airports and
surrounding infrastructure rather than building their own at El Toro,
which they wanted to convert to a park. That's fine, but no free
lunch. The L.A. Airport Commission should assess a $50 user fee on
every LAX or Ontario outbound flight ticket purchased for any person
residing in an Orange County ZIP code. We'll use the money to buy the
excess property at Ballona and build our own park. If they don't want
to pay, they can always take the Amtrak.</TE>

<LD>Re "Dumbing Down the Airwaves," letter, March 6: I have always
enjoyed and respected Ted Koppel and consider him and "Nightline" an
excellent example of a TV news magazine. However, the demise of that
program simply reflects the changing demographics of the broadcast
network viewership and the evolution of a multitude of 24/7 cable
news outlets offering every possible variation of current and
historical events coverage.</LD>
<LD>   As a satellite TV customer, I am about to lose my ABC-NY
programming because I am within the reception sphere of a local ABC
affiliate (Palm Springs). Reviewing what ABC programs that loss would
affect, I found that I only watch two of its offerings in an entire
week, both on Tuesday night. My TV is normally tuned to Fox News
Channel, CNN or MSNBC.</LD>

<TE>   Disney and ABC wanting to drop "Nightline" and "Politically
Incorrect" is unpatriotic and borders on evil at a time when
Americans need, more than ever, to be well informed. To think in
terms of profit by eliminating nearly all hard news from network TV
is disgraceful.</TE>
<TE>   Network news is barely news anymore. It is entertainment. Who
cares if people who don't have cable know almost nothing about what
is going on in their country or in their world? If we continue to
keep the people ignorant, we shall undermine and eventually destroy
our democracy. That "Nightline" has become "irrelevant" is the
opinion of only those who have no clue as to the respect Koppel has
earned as a journalist for getting to some kind of reality and truth
in the vast wasteland of network TV.</TE>

<LD>Most people want to let term limits legislation and big political
contributors do the work of voting for them ("Out of Step, but With a
Big Swagger," Commentary, March 6). So no wonder President Bush keeps
getting his way despite being "out of step with America." The folks
who respond to pollsters are not the folks who vote. I routinely hang

<HD>Bail $500,000 Bail Set Cut Ordered for SLA Suspect</HD>
<DH>Court: Michael Bortin, accused with fourthree others in a
deadly 1975 robbery, is expected to be released by next week. allowed
to post a $500,000 bond.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A Superior Court judge settled the near-term fate Thursday of the
last of four Symbionese Liberation Army suspects arrested in a bloody
1975 suburban bank robbery, ordering $500,000 bail for Michael Bortin
and paving the way for his release.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Thomas Cecil rejected arguments by prosecutors that Bortin,
53, should be held on $1-million bail, a level his attorneys said the
revolutionary turned hardwood floor tradesman could not meet.</LD>
<LD>   "There's precious little evidence leading me to believe Mr. Bortin
is a danger to the community or a flight risk," Cecil declared,
noting that bail is intended to ensure a defendant's presence at
trial, not serve as punishment.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said they expected bail, secured with the help
of his family and friends, to be posted and Bortin released by early
next week.</TE>
<TE>   James A. Bustamante, one of Bortin's attorneys, said his client is
"a very happy man."</TE>
<TE>   His release would mean that three of the four defendants in the
case have been allowed to return home before trial, which probably
won't begin until early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Bill and Emily Harris, former spouses and now defendants in the
Sacramento case, were released last month after each posted
$1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth defendant, Sara Jane Olson, remains behind bars and
ineligible for release after being sentenced six weeks ago to prison
for a failed bombing attempt against LAPD officers in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   A fifth suspect, James Kilgore, has been a fugitive since the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Bortin, they are accused of participating in a bank
heist 27 years ago in a Sacramento suburb that ended with the shotgun
slaying of Myrna Opsahl, a 42-year-old mother of four. She had just
arrived at the Crocker National Bank in Carmichael to count church
dues when masked gunmen stormed the branch.</TE>
<TE>   The case has refocused national attention on the SLA, one of the
most violent bands of militants to emerge during the Vietnam War era.
The group rocketed into the headlines in 1974 with the kidnapping of
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, who is expected to be a key
witness for the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Rob Gold said Bortin deserved bail equal to
that of his co-defendants because of the serious nature of the crime,
his "violent career" with the SLA and his fugitive past. For a decade
in the 1970s and early '80s, Bortin evaded law officers.</TE>
<TE>   But after serving time for past crimes during his radical years,
Bortin married Olson's sister, Josephine, and established roots and a
business in Portland, Ore., where he lives with his wife and
children.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Serra, one of his attorneys, told the judge during a
45-minute hearing that Bortin "in many ways was a wayward youth," but
that he is "a much different person now. .... He won't disappoint
you."</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Josephine Bortin said simply, "I just want to
bring him home safely." She then fled down a hallway from a cluster
of TV news cameras.</TE>

<HD>Women of the West Museum Will Merge With the Autry</HD>
<DH>Culture: Operations of the Denver-based center, best known
for its online and community programs, will be shifted to Los
Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Denver-based Women of the West Museum will merge in April with
the Autry Museum of Western Heritage in Griffith Park, the heads of
both announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came only weeks after John L. Gray, chief
executive of the Autry, said it was no longer pursuing a partnership
with the financially troubled Southwest Museum of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Founded in 1991, the Women of the West Museum is best known for
its online and community programs.</LD>
<TE>   Its prize-winning Web site says its mission is "to discover,
explore and communicate the continuing roles of women in shaping the
West."</TE>
<TE>   According to Gray, the Denver museum proposed the merger, in which
the women's museum will be absorbed into the Autry. "They approached
us in November based on our work on Western history and our inclusive
and contemporary view of the West," Gray said. "They feel our
missions are closely aligned."</TE>
<TE>   Each museum will contribute $1 million to create a new endowed
position at the Autry, curator of Western women's history.</TE>
<TE>   A committee of people from each museum will conduct a national
search to fill the post.</TE>
<TE>   The Denver museum has an endowment of $100,000 to fund the annual
Women of the West Museum Butcher Scholar Award. That award will
continue, with the Butcher Scholar in residence at the Autry each
year.</TE>
<TE>   Four trustees of the women's museum will become members of the
Autry board. Exhibits, programs and related materials now part of the
women's museum will be incorporated into the Autry's program.</TE>
<TE>   Some 800 volumes from the library of the Denver museum also will
go to Autry. Marsha Semmel, chief executive of the Women of the West
Museum, said that early in its history it had hoped to have a museum
structure.</TE>
<TE>   But it was never able to fund construction or to amass, preserve
and store museum artifacts. Instead, it began to emphasize
programming, often tapping the collections of other institutions to
create original exhibits on such topics as women on the sod-house
frontier and the struggle for women's suffrage in the West.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibits often involved community outreach and were
distributed electronically.</TE>
<TE>   The museum discovered, Semmel said, that "the Web site was an
effective and convenient way to reach large national and
international audiences."</TE>
<TE>   The Autry was founded in 1988 by singing cowboy and businessman
Gene Autry and his wife, Jackie. It has an extensive collection
devoted to the West and has mounted numerous exhibits on the cultural
diversity of the West.</TE>
<TE>   It has an operating budget of about $12 million a year and gets
about 330,000 visitors annually.</TE>
<TE>   The Denver museum has an annual operating budget of $900,000. Its
Web site gets about 28,000 viewings a month.</TE>
<TE>   "One indication of what a good fit this is is how smoothly [the
merger process] has gone," Semmel said. She said she and her
colleagues had no regrets about the merger. "The atmosphere is one of
joy and celebration. We think we've found a wonderful partner in the
Autry."</TE>
<TE>   Sue Armitage, a distinguished professor of history at Washington
State University, said she thought the merger was a creative way for
the Denver museum to continue to fulfill its mission in spite of
financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Ideas are one thing, and buildings and funding are another," said
Armitage, a pioneer in Western women's history who helped the Denver
museum create its first exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's wonderful," Armitage said of the merger. "Really,
the goal of women's history is to have it be part of the mainstream
story. We want everybody to know about women's history." The women's
museum will close its offices in April, and the Web site will
continue in some form, Semmel said.</TE>

<HD>Ida Bernstein, 94; Used Paintings to Chronicle War-Torn
Ukraine</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ida Bernstein, who chronicled her tragic childhood history in
war-torn Ukraine by painting somber stylistic oils, has died. She was
94.</LD>
<LD>   Bernstein died Sunday night in her Los Angeles home, said her
daughter, Rozanne Hinner, of myelodysplastic syndrome, a bone marrow
disease.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Dubova, Ukraine, in 1907, Bernstein survived the
tumultuous Russian civil war, although many members of her family did
not.</LD>
<TE>   Like a latter-day Grandma Moses, she began painting when she was
about 60 to document her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a writer," she told The Times in 1998 when the A Shenere
Velt Gallery, operated by the Workmen's Circle, staged a show of her
work. "But I always wanted to tell my story. When we came here,
nobody paid attention to why we came."</TE>
<TE>   In 1919, when she was 11, bandits had attacked her family, hacking
to death her 17-year-old sister and 2-year-old brother and murdering
her father as he prayed at a nearby synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   She and her other sisters fled their house in a hail of bullets.
Separated from the others, Bernstein hid in a ditch overnight with a
neighborhood boy and the next day moved to a haystack where a kindly
woman fed the two children for two more nights.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein was reunited with her sisters and her seriously ill
mother, but her mother died shortly afterward. One of the aging
artist's most moving canvases was a portrait of her mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a picture of my mother, so I visualized her," she
said in 1998, standing near the painting. "She's lost her children,
her husband, her home, her money, and she's sick and no one will help
her."</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein and surviving members of her family came to America in
1923, settling in Chicago. In 1935, she moved to Los Angeles, where
she and her husband raised a son and twin daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Among her works of art were etchings of the 1919 childhood flight
from the robbers and dozens of drawings and oils reflecting events
throughout Bernstein's life: her labor in the garment industry in the
1930s, the Holocaust in the 1940s, the execution of Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg during the McCarthy era of the 1950s and anti-war protests
of the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Educators and art critics credited the 4-foot-6, white-haired
Bernstein with creating an illustrated history not only of her life
but also of major traumatic events of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Hinner, Bernstein is survived by two other
children, Marvin Bernstein and Marianne Spiegel; six grandchildren;
and 13 great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are planned for 11 a.m. today at Mt. Sinai Mortuary. The
family has asked that any memorial donations be made to Choose
Ability First (formerly called the Crippled Children's Society) at
6530 Winnetka Ave., Woodland Hills, CA 91367.</TE>

<HD>New Science Institute Spins Off Its 1st Firm</HD>
<DH>Biotech: Claremont's Keck Institute creates a company that
will market machines to identify gene characteristics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIPTON BLISH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Claremont Colleges' newest branch, which opened two years ago
with the purpose of teaching biotechnology for business purposes, has
spun off its first company.</LD>
<LD>   Next week the Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences
will unveil Ionian Technologies, a biotech company that will market
machines that identify gene characteristics.</LD>
<LD>   The technology is the work of two of Keck's most accomplished
scientists, Jeff Van Ness and David Galas. Van Ness has conducted
groundbreaking research in the genetics of bone disease and growth,
and Galas directed the Human Genome Project in the early 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   The two have developed a technology that can measure very small
pieces of DNA. Initially, researchers will use the technology to find
the genetic expression of a disease, Galas said.</TE>
<TE>   Using a mass spectrometer, a machine that measures the weight of
molecules, Keck researchers have found a way to identify any sequence
in a fragment of DNA. So any condition that is genetic, such as the
ability to metabolize some drugs, could be diagnosed by examining the
sequence. Companies that do such diagnoses might be among Ionian's
customers.</TE>
<TE>   The Keck Graduate Institute was founded on principles that differ
from those of traditional graduate schools and universities. The
school promised to prepare students not so much for a life of
teaching and research, but to work in the burgeoning biotech,
biomedical and medical instrument industries.</TE>
<TE>   No other school teaches its students the mix of science and
business management that this one does, Keck President Henry Riggs
said at the school's inception. Students must know not only the
technology but how to manage a company and bring a product to the
marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   "It has always been planned to transfer technology as well as we
can into societal use," Riggs said Thursday. "One of the ways is to
spin off companies with technology that was developed at KGI. That is
what we have done, and we are very pleased about it."</TE>
<TE>   The institute has a stake in the company, as do Galas and Van
Ness, Riggs said. Both the school and the scientists will benefit
from the company's sales. As part of its licensing agreement with the
school, Ionian will sponsor research at Keck in the same field.</TE>
<TE>   Keck's close relations with industry--a who's who of top biotech
company executives serve on its advisory board--were the focus of
protests when the school opened.</TE>
<TE>   Keck faculty members, who are not granted tenure, can serve as
directors of companies that are spun off from their research but are
barred from management positions as long as they stay on the faculty.</TE>
<TE>   Spinning off a company so soon is a triumph for the institute,
which has yet to graduate its first class. Van Ness boasts that all
28 students who started in 2000 are expected to graduate in May.
Several students from this year's graduating class were interns at
Ionian last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Next Thursday, Ionian will debut at an investors' conference in
Los Angeles. By next year, the company expects to begin shipping its
technology, said President and CEO Sean Gallagher.</TE>
<TE>   Gallagher expects the first customers to come from medical and
agricultural laboratories. For now the company's lone employee,
Gallagher expects to hire between eight and 10 employees by the end
of this year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Court of Appeal on Thursday denied a request by former
Compton City Councilwoman Leslie Irving to return to her seat, which
she lost in a recent trial over alleged election irregularities, a
city spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Irving was ousted from her council seat for allegedly registering
noncitizens to vote and soliciting votes from absentee voters and
lying about it in court.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin also ruled Feb. 8 that
Irving, along with Mayor Eric Perrodin, had received an unfair
advantage when their names were illegally listed first on the
election ballots. An appeals court judge eventually reinstated
Perrodin.</LD>
<TE>   When informed of the appellate court ruling, Melanie Andrews, who
replaced Irving on the council, was ''thrilled and relieved,''
spokesman Frank Wheaton said.</TE>

<HD>Valley Clinic Prepares for Expanded Role</HD>
<DH>Health care: North Hollywood facility's move to bigger
quarters will allow for treatment of more patients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overwhelmed by more patients than it can serve, Valley Community
Clinic will move into a larger, $5.5-million building next week,
allowing the North Hollywood facility to expand its health-care
services to the region's indigent and working poor.</LD>
<LD>   By making the move from its cramped Vineland Avenue location to
the larger building at Coldwater Canyon Avenue and Vanowen Street,
clinic officials say they will have more room to treat the 20,000
patients now served annually as well as the 10,400 patients it turns
away.</LD>
<LD>   "In this economic climate ... we are grateful that this expansion
will allow us to provide vitally needed medical and health services
to so many more hard-working, low-income, uninsured people," said Ann
Brit, clinic president and chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually, the larger quarters will allow the clinic to offer
prenatal, pediatric and dental care, which patients have identified
as critically needed services, clinic officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Work crews have spent the past month painting, laying carpet and
installing cabinets at the two-story, 45,000-square-foot building.
Clinic staff members, who plan to move into the new facility March
16, expect to see patients on March 18.</TE>
<TE>   The new facility is a former medical office built to meet state
codes for parking, wheelchair accessibility and other licensing
requirements for medical facilities, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic's current space is a cluster of converted retail stores
totaling about 10,500 square feet with limited street parking.</TE>
<TE>   Clinic officials said they expect that within three years the
annual number of general medical visits will increase from 20,000 to
45,000, counseling center visits from 4,700 to 8,420 and teen
health-center visits from 14,500 to 28,000.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of the building is occupied by medical service providers
that lease space from the clinic, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The lease payments would help finance the prenatal, pediatric and
dental services, among other uses.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to move into the new site represents a shift in
direction for clinic officials, who two years ago had planned to move
into a proposed commercial development across the street from the
North Hollywood subway station.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic fit the concept for commercial development in the
subway station area because it met a need for local residents,
according to Community Redevelopment Agency officials.</TE>
<TE>   Some business owners in the area, however, said the clinic was
incompatible with the aim of the redevelopment project to attract
mid-level to upscale stores, restaurants and entertainment venues to
the subway site.</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiasm for the site cooled among the clinic's board of
directors after it discussed the proposal with its benefactors.</TE>
<TE>   "We surveyed our community, and a lot of our supporters were
skeptical about the clinic ever moving into the building by the 2006
completion date," clinic spokeswoman Judi Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the board decided in August that finding a larger
facility would be its top priority.</TE>
<TE>   The board learned that one of the clinic's volunteer doctors was a
member of a physicians' group that had recently purchased the
Coldwater Canyon Avenue property after its previous owner went
bankrupt.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators from both sides agreed on the $5.5-million sale price
in October and closed escrow Jan. 31, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic recently launched a funding campaign to help pay off
its debt. It was awarded a $1.5-million federal grant administered by
the city of Los Angeles for providing health-care services to the
community.</TE>

<HD>Prop. 40 Win Means Funding Likely for Crystal Cove Cottage
Restoration</HD>
<DH>Beaches: Plan would renovate the 1920s-era homes and make

green light,' a parks official says.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An ambitious plan to restore historic beach cottages at Crystal Cove
State Park is expected to win full funding after the passage this
week of a statewide parks ballot measure.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 40 will funnel $2.6billion into park projects and
environmental initiatives across California.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, parks officials had secured only about half of the
$10million to $12 million needed to transform the dilapidated
cottages into beachfront lodges. Funds from the bond measure should
cover the rest, they said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a solid green light for Crystal Cove," said Roy Stearns,
deputy director of the Department of Parks and Recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Stearns said Crystal Cove has at least three potential claims on
Proposition 40 money: the $225million earmarked for improvements at
existing parks, the $267million for historic and cultural resources,
and the $200 million the California Coastal Conservancy will receive
for various open-space projects.</TE>
<TE>   State officials are now drawing up the list of projects that will
be funded. "Crystal Cove will absolutely be a high priority on that
list. It will be funded," Stearns said.</TE>
<TE>   The 46 vintage cottages, considered the last intact example of a
1920s Southern California beach colony, are between Corona del Mar
and Laguna Beach. They have been essentially vacant since the
longtime tenants who rented them from the state were evicted in June.</TE>
<TE>   The state took the action in an effort to make the picturesque
area more accessible to the public. But the parks department had been
criticized for evicting the tenants before it had secured funding for
the restoration of the cottages and installation of a new sewer
system.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major turning point for Crystal Cove," said Laura
Davick, an environmentalist who has pushed for improvements at the
park.</TE>
<TE>   The project calls for fixing up the cottages and offering them to
the public for overnight stays.</TE>
<TE>   Also being considered are an interpretive nature center, a center
for working artists, hostels and an ecological research center.</TE>
<TE>   The state also plans to remove El Morro Village, a trailer park,
from a portion of Crystal Cove.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) has proposed postponing the
El Morro evictions--scheduled for 2004--and increasing the rents
there to help pay for the improvements.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would withdraw his bill if funding could be found
elsewhere, but Thursday, Campbell said he isn't ready to do that yet,
despite the bond's passage.</TE>
<TE>   "Until [the money has been allocated] I'll continue to move the
bill forward," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   He conceded, however, that the chances are good that the funding
will be available.</TE>
<TE>   "What I think Proposition 40 does is open up new sources that
didn't exist on Monday for getting money."</TE>

<LD>The teenage son of a Pomona Superior Court commissioner struck a deal
with prosecutors Thursday in a vehicular manslaughter case in which
he was accused of careening into a crowd of pedestrians in Pasadena,
killing three people.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plea agreement, Jarett Olson, 18, admitted to three
misdemeanor counts of vehicular manslaughter. He had been charged
with three felony counts of vehicular manslaughter and one felony
count of reckless driving resulting in great bodily harm.</LD>
<LD>   "After a review at the highest levels of this office, it was
decided this was a fair disposition for this case," said Sandi
Gibbons, a Los Angeles County district attorney's office spokeswoman.</LD>
<TE>   Olson's sport-utility vehicle slammed into a group of families
outside Chandler School on April 29, 2000, instantly killing Sarah
Karesh, 34, of Pasadena and her 3-year-old daughter, Madison.
Nicholas Montoya, 4, died a week later of head injuries, and his
grandfather, Philip Montoya, had a leg amputated.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Olson's vehicle swerved into oncoming
traffic and then hit the families on the sidewalk, pinning people
under the car and against a stone wall.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, of Pasadena, was charged in Juvenile Court because he was
16 at the time of the incident. A Juvenile Court commissioner could
sentence Olson to remain in his parents' home while on probation, or
send him to a group home or a California Youth Authority institution.</TE>
<TE>   An adult who agreed to such a plea could have received up to three
years in prison, Gibbons said. The victims' families are also suing
Olson in civil court.</TE>

<HD>Bald Eagles May Soon Return to Skies Over Channel Islands</HD>
<DH>Environment: National Park Service proposes introducing the
birds under a five-year study to see if they can survive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Park Service officials hope to repopulate the northern
Channel Islands with bald eagles, 50 years after the majestic birds
were killed off by widespread pesticide contamination.</LD>
<LD>   A proposal to bring back the birds calls for a five-year study to
determine whether the eagles could survive independently on Santa
Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands off the Ventura
County coast.</LD>
<LD>   In restoration projects on Santa Catalina Island, residual effects
of the now-banned DDT--still lingering in a 100-ton pool of pesticide
on the ocean floor off the Palos Verde Peninsula--have prevented the
eagles from reproducing naturally.</LD>
<TE>   A toxic byproduct of DDT, called DDE, thins the shells of bald
eagle eggs, leaving them highly susceptible to being crushed by
mother birds before they are hatched.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers hope that the study, which would include extensive
monitoring of the birds early on, can prevent the same scenario from
unfolding on the northern islands.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by a committee of state and federal agencies, the
study would begin as soon as this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "If we find that the eagles aren't going to do any better on the
northern islands, everyone will have to rethink things and determine
what else we are going to do," said Laura Valoppi, a biologist with
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   The restoration effort is made possible because of a $145-million
lawsuit settlement with Montrose Chemical Co., a Los Angeles County
pesticide manufacturer that dumped an estimated 1,800 tons of DDT
into the ocean from 1947 to 1971.</TE>
<TE>   About $30 million of the settlement is earmarked for projects to
restore damaged birds, fish and other wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Bald eagles, the United States' symbol of freedom, are still
listed as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species
Act, said Kate Faulkner, chief of natural resource management for the
Channel Islands National Park.</TE>
<TE>   During the last 30 years, the birds have repopulated in other
parts of the country, but the Channel Islands remain one of the few
areas where recovery goals have not been met, Faulkner said.</TE>
<TE>   "The bald eagles haven't wanted to come back on their own," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   As in the Catalina Island project, the eagles on the Channel
Islands would come from a breeding program at the San Francisco Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Up to a dozen chicks annually would be placed on Santa Cruz
Island, in boxes mounted to tall wooden poles simulating a nest
environment, Faulkner said.</TE>
<TE>   Then would begin a thorough--and potentially pricey--monitoring
program to collect data on the eagles' flight and feeding patterns,
as well as the health of the environment around the islands, Valoppi
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to just release eagles out there and walk away,
because we know there's a chance they won't do well, as on Catalina,"
she said. "All of this data is very important to answer these
questions before we move ahead and fully commit the money to restore
bald eagles on the Channel Islands."</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they do not yet know the project's total price tag.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed in the plan, which was unveiled last month, are four main
components: surveillance of the eagles using radio and satellite
technology; monitoring of the eagles' feeding on sea lion carcasses,
which are the primary carriers of the poison DDE; a program to
capture the birds at 2 to 3 years old and take blood samples to be
analyzed for DDE exposure; and collection of data to compare with
data from the early 1990s and determine trends.</TE>
<TE>   Early estimates put the cost of the study, not including the
blood-sampling portion, at $350,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists believe that at one time there were 24 nesting pairs of
bald eagles on the four northernmost islands. Their presence, reduced
over time by the intrusion of man, ended altogether with the
widespread use of DDT in the 1950s.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Is Set on Gaining El Toro</HD>
<DH>Land use: City won't let Navy's plan to sell the base deter
it from annexing the site for a park, educational uses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine officials plan to forge ahead with their bid to annex the
former El Toro Marine air base and convert it into a sprawling park,
despite the U.S. Navy's plan to sell off the prime suburban real
estate to the highest bidder.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine City Councilman Chris Mears said that, because of Tuesday's
passage of Measure W, the Navy's announcement does not trump the
city's hopes to replace the base with a park. That vote rezoned the
area for a mix of parkland, open space and limited-density
educational uses, such as a university, zoo and botanical garden.</LD>
<LD>   "The people overwhelmingly said, 'Enough is enough. We want the
use described in Measure W,' and I think they ultimately will have
it," Mears said. "We're going to proceed with what we hope is the
successful annexation of the base as a Great Park."</LD>
<TE>   Irvine's stance capped a day of competing visions put forth for
the base's future. Undaunted by both the vote and the Navy's
announcement, pro-airport forces moved toward what could be a
last-gasp effort to salvage a commercial airfield at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   The Airport Working Group, a leading proponent of an international
airport at the base, was mapping out a possible legal challenge to
Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a group of airline pilots and aviation engineers
submitted a proposed November ballot initiative Thursday that would
supplant Measure W with a modified version of a previous airport
option called the V-plan.</TE>
<TE>   That option would realign runways to direct departing planes south
over parkland. But that proposal was rejected by county planners and
is opposed by the powerful Irvine Co., which fears it would send
flights over its expensive homes at Newport Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Under the V-plan, planes would land from the north, the opposite
of the path the county had proposed and voters rendered moot under
Measure W, which bars an airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park Councilman Bob McGowan, a former air traffic controller
and United Airlines pilot, said he hoped supporters of the Reasonable
Airport, Park and Nature Preserve Initiative can persuade Navy
officials to hold off declaring El Toro surplus and selling the
4,700-acre base. "The Navy is waiting for something else to come up,"
he said. "We have 30 days. We're hoping to have the signatures for
the ballot."</TE>
<TE>   The Airport Working Group and Citizens for Jobs and the Economy,
another pro-airport group, have backed the V-plan effort, said
organizer Russ Niewiarowski of Santa Ana Heights.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why [the Navy is] so anxious to put up a for-sale
sign," he said. "With our initiative, and the lawsuit, it'll send a
strong message that it's not over."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters said they will ask the Board of Supervisors to put the
initiative on the ballot without requiring them to gather signatures
of registered voters in the county.</TE>
<TE>   But the board's 3-2 pro-airport majority earlier refused to put a
similar measure on the ballot, and with Supervisors Cynthia P. Coad
and Jim Silva's announced plans to drop support for an airport after
the passage of Measure W, it seemed unlikely that the effort would
gain much support.</TE>
<TE>   Navy spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Pauline Storum said the Navy would
accept the V-plan proposal under the public comment period after the
release today of its final environmental review of El Toro. Any
submissions, she said, would be considered before the Navy announces
a final decision on April 23.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials said Wednesday that they intend to sell the base,
either in parcels or as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I think overall we're trying to come to closure with the base
closure," Storum said, pointing out that the decision to mothball El
Toro was made in 1993, and it was closed in 1999. "Here it is 2002
and we're still trying to finish the process."</TE>

<DH>Ethics: Commission cites DWR's delay in revealing potential
conflicts of interest in hiring 52 consultants during crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Department of Water Resources has agreed to pay a $69,500 fine
for belatedly disclosing potential conflicts of interest with 52
energy consultants hired at the height of last year's electricity
crisis.</LD>
<LD>   If the negotiated settlement is approved by the Fair Political
Practices Commission on Thursday, the fine will be paid by the
department, not individual employees, DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo
said.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed fine is a compromise, both in the amount and in who
would be responsible. In January, state sources said FPPC
investigators were proposing fines totaling $100,000 against
department director Tom Hannigan, deputy director Ray Hart, former
general counsel Susan Weber and personnel director Greg Rowsey.</LD>
<TE>   Thrust into the emergency job of buying electricity for 27 million
Californians in January, DWR did not require the dozens of
consultants it hired to submit personal conflict-of-interest forms
until July.</TE>
<TE>   Ten spot market traders filed their statements of economic
interest more than 100 days past the filing due date, according to
documents prepared by FPPC investigators. Such a failure resulted in
"serious public harm," they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "For a significant length of time, DWR's violations deprived the
public of the ability to monitor whether these decision-makers had
conflicts of interest," wrote the FPPC enforcement division.</TE>
<TE>   But because the penalties occurred in the context of a crisis, the
FPPC proposed less than the maximum fines.</TE>
<TE>   DWR was thrust into the job of buying electricity in January 2001,
when three major utilities became short of cash and blackouts
threatened the state.</TE>
<TE>   The department quickly hired dozens of consultants to buy
electricity on the spot market, negotiate long-term power contracts,
and serve as financial and energy market advisors. Months later, it
was discovered that several consultants owned stock in companies with
which they did business. In July, five consultants were fired.</TE>
<TE>   According to FPPC documents, DWR officials asked the department's
attorneys for advice on conflict-of-interest laws around March 1,
2001. DWR legal staff then spent more than two months studying
whether consultants, as defined in DWR's conflict-of-interest code,
must disclose their financial interests. "Because of the demands on
the agency and their own lack of familiarity with the energy
industry, the staff's research was complex and time-consuming,"
concluded FPPC investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement was negotiated for DWR by attorney Joseph Remcho, a

<HD>Money for Fire Survivor Is Stolen</HD>
<DH>Crime: Donations continue after money intended for girl who
survived fire was stolen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Sheriff's investigators asked for help Thursday in their search for
suspects in the theft of $1,500 collected for a 9-year-old girl, the
only survivor in a fire that killed five children after her father
allegedly lighted a charcoal grill inside the family's Pico Rivera
home.</LD>
<LD>   The money was in a 5-gallon jug taken from the counter of Mario's
Tacos Monday night by a man and two women, said Lt. Stephen T. Gattis
of the Pico Rivera Sheriff's Station.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, dozens of supporters of Kassandra Garcia showed up at
the brown stucco restaurant in the 9200 block of Whittier Boulevard
in Pico Rivera to eat and drop a few more dollars into a new jug that
was now tied to the counter with a rope.</LD>
<TE>   Among the supporters were Ester Ramirez, 67, and her two sons and
three daughters, all of Pico Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   "Mario's was just trying to help this poor family," Ramirez said,
shaking her head, "and then someone comes in with no heart and
snatches all the money away. It's incredible. It's terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Mario's owner, Celia Jimenez, 59, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "In my younger days I would have jumped the counter and taken
those thieves down myself," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A few feet away, her husband was taking telephone calls from
people promising to send Kassandra checks for as much as $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Gattis encouraged anyone with information on
those responsible to contact authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Gattis said the man and two women had been in the restaurant for
more than an hour before the man, described as about 6 feet tall, 180
pounds and 25 years old with a shaved head, grabbed the jug and
dashed outside where two women were waiting in a white Honda.</TE>
<TE>   The crime occurred in front of dozens of patrons. It also was
caught on a surveillance camera.</TE>
<TE>   "This has just added to the pain the community was already going
through," Gattis said. "The community wants to know: Who would be so
mean, so callous, so insensitive to take this money that was going to
help a little girl who lost her brothers and sisters?"</TE>
<TE>   Kassandra's sisters and brothers--Brenda, 10; Jonathan, 7;
Anthony, 2; Cecilia, 4; and Vanessa, 6--died.</TE>
<TE>   Their father, Adair Javier Garcia, 30, has been charged with one
count each of murder in the Feb. 20 deaths of the children.</TE>
<TE>   The children's mother, Adriana Ibeth Arreola, had left the house a
week before. Police have said Adair Garcia was apparently despondent
over marital problems.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not decided whether to seek the death penalty.</TE>

<HD>Warren J. Harding, 77; First Man to Scale Yosemite's El
Capitan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warren J. Harding, a pioneer rock climber who made the first ascent
of Yosemite's towering El Capitan in 1958, a breakthrough that
ushered in "big wall" climbing in America, has died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Harding died of liver failure Feb. 27 in his home in Happy Valley,
near Anderson in Shasta County.</LD>
<LD>   Nicknamed "Batso" by a fellow climber in the early 1970s--for his
hanging off rock walls like a bat--the 5-foot-6 Harding was an
iconoclastic California character known for his courage, flair and
sense of humor.</LD>
<TE>   Harding, who once described rock climbers as "glorified flagpole
sitters," dined on a Thanksgiving turkey his mother had baked for him
after hauling it up 600 feet by rope to his bivouac on a ledge during
his historic El Capitan climb.</TE>
<TE>   He made his living as a land surveyor on roads, highways and
subdivisions. But it was while hanging precariously, often for days,
on sheer granite cliffs in Yosemite that he became a legend.</TE>
<TE>   In a climbing career that spanned the 1950s through the '70s, the
sport's golden age, Harding made 30 first ascents in Yosemite. Among
the most significant: the south face of Half Dome, two routes on El
Capitan (the Nose and the Wall of the Early Morning Light), and the
west face of the Leaning Tower.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, he took climbing to another level in the late '50s by
daring to go up and spend long periods of time on the big faces in
Yosemite when no one had ever done so," said photographer Galen
Rowell, who was Harding's climbing partner on the Half Dome climb in
1970.</TE>
<TE>   Harding and a series of partners made the famous 1958 ascent of El
Capitan via the so-called Nose route. Reaching the top took 45 days
of climbing, which they did in stages over 18 months, leaving fixed
lines down to the ground for easy access when they went back up.</TE>
<TE>   The last nine days of the climb in November 1958, with partners
George Whitmore and Wayne Merry, were spent continuously on the upper
part of the wall, the longest time anyone had ever spent on a wall up
to that point.</TE>
<TE>   To conquer the 3,000-foot monolith, Harding used 600 pitons (small
spikes with eyes for safety ropes that are driven into natural cracks
in the rock), and he drilled 125 holes for expansion bolts on blank
parts of the cliff where pitons could not be used.</TE>
<TE>   Harding's use of expansion bolts sparked a controversy among
climbers.</TE>
<TE>   "Some climbers felt that if you couldn't use all the natural
features on the rock that you should not do the climb," Rowell said.
"Warren had a libertarian view of climbing and said, 'That's just a
beautiful face and I want to do it.'</TE>
<TE>   "He was very bold and very determined and thought climbing was one
of the last places in North America where you could be totally free
and make your own decisions, and he went for it."</TE>
<TE>   The expansion-bolt controversy grew in 1970 when Harding and
partner Dean Caldwell spent 27 days climbing the Wall of the Early
Morning Light, a blank section of El Capitan about 200 feet east of
the Nose.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas he had used 125 expansion bolts in his 1958 climb, Harding
used 300 on the 1970 climb.</TE>
<TE>   The two men had planned to reach the summit in 12 days, but rain
and freezing temperatures slowed their progress. At one point, the
National Park Service decided the two climbers needed to be rescued,
but Harding and Caldwell refused to come down.</TE>
<TE>   The climb attracted the intense interest of curiosity seekers and
the print and television media, which followed their daily progress.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the Wall of the Early Morning Light--so named because
it catches the first rays of the rising sun--was one of the few
remaining unconquered routes in Yosemite.</TE>
<TE>   When Harding began climbing in the early 1950s, Rowell said,
virtually none of the major rock faces in North America had been
climbed.</TE>
<TE>   "So it was an open field for somebody like Warren who had
boundless energy and desire to do those kinds of things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland-born Harding, whose father worked for the state
Department of Highways, grew up in Downieville and Marysville. During
World War II, he worked as a propeller mechanic at Sacramento's
McClellan Field. As a surveyor after the war, he worked first for the
state and then for private construction firms.</TE>
<TE>   Harding, who always enjoyed the outdoors, didn't start climbing
until he was 30.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow climber Steve Roper remembers Harding's penchant for having
a good time, even while suspended hundreds of feet from the floor of
Yosemite Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas other climbers would eat a can of tuna or a candy bar on a
climb, Roper said, "he always hauled up good food and wine."</TE>
<TE>   Handsome, with jet black hair in his prime, Harding was known for
driving fancy sports cars, often having a good-looking woman on his
arm, and drinking red wine from gallon jugs. At one point he took to
wearing Army fatigues, which he dyed black and wore with a black
turtleneck, a look some of the younger climbers emulated.</TE>
<TE>   Harding wrote a whimsical autobiography in 1975, "Downward Bound,"
and created a climbing tent and other equipment for his own climbs
produced by what he called BAT (Basically Absurd Technology).</TE>
<TE>   "To him, climbing was for fun, and he didn't like people to take
themselves too seriously about climbing," said Alice Flomp, Harding's
companion since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   After his retirement as a surveyor in 1989, Harding became the
oldest man to climb El Capitan, ascending the Nose route he had
pioneered. He was 65.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Harding and Flomp's mobile home in Happy Valley,
on more than an acre studded with pine and oak trees, often drew
visits from young rock climbers.</TE>
<TE>   But in his final days, it was Harding's old climbing pals who
stopped by. Rowell visited Harding three days before he died.</TE>
<TE>   At first, according to Rowell, the gravely ill Harding "didn't say
a word."</TE>
<TE>   But then Rowell read Harding a letter he had received from a
friend who had always admired Harding and wanted to write about him
for a biker magazine. He didn't care if Harding had never ridden a
Harley, the writer said; "he was the biker mystique personified."</TE>
<TE>   "I finally said, 'Warren, can you hear me?' He was almost in a
coma. 'Can you nod or something?' Warren opened his eyes and looked
me in the eye for about five seconds and said, 'I want wine.' I spoke
to Alice. She said, 'Well, it can't hurt him now. Here's a jug of
red, go give him a glass.' I put it up to his lips and he drank it.</TE>
<TE>   "He basically walked the walk all the way to the end."</TE>
<TE>   Harding is survived by a sister, Ardeth Barber of West Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for noon Sunday in the VFW Hall,
905 Drever St., West Sacramento.</TE>

International Airport protested what they say are substandard wages
and poor benefit plans during a march at the airport Thursday.
Employee representatives also alleged that airport employers have
routinely violated basic labor protections. Union organizers say
about 3,000 of the 40,000 people employed at LAX are not paid the
city's living wage and receive no benefits. Workers also claim
treatment has worsened since Sept. 11.</CP>

<LD>A man who broke into his ex-girlfriend's apartment and fatally
stabbed her boyfriend in a jealous rage was found dead Thursday
morning in a Reseda flood-control channel after he apparently
committed suicide, police said.</LD>
<LD>   A construction worker found the body of Matthew Elliot Lee, 25,
about 9:45 a.m. in the wash at Kittridge Street and Reseda Boulevard,
said Det. Rick Swanston, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Lee stabbed himself several times in the chest, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Hours earlier, Lee used a 24-foot stepladder to climb to the
third-floor balcony of his ex-girlfriend's apartment in the 6300
block of Reseda Boulevard, detectives said.</TE>
<TE>   There, Lee kicked in a screen door about 8:45 p.m. and used a
hunting knife to repeatedly stab the woman's current boyfriend, Jesse
Jamar Jackson, 25, of Inglewood, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who was found in the apartment's entryway, died at the
scene. His girlfriend, Candice Harriman, fled when Lee burst into her
residence and was not injured.</TE>
<TE>   Lee and Harriman's four-year relationship ended in August, police
said.</TE>

<HD>Decline in Petty Theft Cuts Ojai Crime by 12%</HD>
<DH>Safety: Increased Sheriff's Department staffing has meant
more enforcement, officials say, especially involving transient
population.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In tiny Ojai, where drug offenses and domestic violence are the
biggest worries of police, crime dropped 12% last year, entirely
because of a large reduction in petty thefts.</LD>
<LD>   Reported crime dropped from 200 in the year 2000 to 177 last year
as small-time thieves stole just 83 times, instead of 115 the
previous year, according to the Sheriff's Department, which acts as
Ojai's police agency.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have a tremendous population up here," Sgt. Ken Edling
said. "So it doesn't take much for the numbers to change
dramatically."</LD>
<TE>   Minor thefts were probably down so sharply, Edling said, because
deputies cracked down last year on transients under the influence of
alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai, the county's smallest city with 8,000 residents, draws
homeless people every winter in response to quality accommodations in
the community's church-sponsored homeless shelter program, Edling
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our deputies have asked them why they come to our shelter, and
they say the food's better," Edling said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, at the beginning of March each year when the shelter
closes, many transients return to the river bottoms in Ventura and
Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Sheriff's Department finally has the staffing
to enforce laws, which deputies think makes a difference in petty
thefts. The department's Ojai Valley force, which includes 11
officers for the city of Ojai, had been short-staffed.</TE>
<TE>   But its 22 patrol deputies are now up to 30 or more, and that
makes a difference in the enforcement of minor offenses, Edling said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've stepped up our bike patrols, and they're arresting these
guys for alcohol abuse," he said, adding that transients had kept to
the shelter at night, but during the day "we've had problems with
some of them victimizing businesses."</TE>
<TE>   The city's most serious crimes--felony violence--rose from 16
offenses to 20 last year, as rapes increased from zero to two and
robberies from one to three.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's anything to make of that," Edling said.
"The numbers are so small."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, home burglaries were up by one and business burglaries
increased by six. Auto thefts increased by one, to six.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say the biggest things here are drugs, and we have a lot of
domestic violence issues up here," Edling said. "But we're out of
that [crime] loop along the freeway. We're kind of like an island up
here."</TE>

<HD>When Stupid Suspect Dials 911, It's the Crafty Cops Who
Come Calling</HD>

<LD>In today's stupid criminal tricks episode, sneaky L.A. County
sheriff's deputies acquired the pager number of a missing suspect,
called him and left a 911 "emergency" message.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect dialed 911 and, of course, hung up immediately when he
realized whom he had reached. But the call gave away his location.</LD>
<LD>   Deputies visited and arrested him for possession of a stolen
weapon.</LD>
<TE>   Tinseltown dilemma: OK, a consultant's report found that the
Hollywood area would be viable as an independent city. But here's the
big question: What would the city be called?</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood" is out for a couple of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First, as City Councilman Tom LaBonge told The Times on Thursday,
the Hollywood sign "is in Griffith Park, and Griffith Park is in Los
Angeles. They're not going to get the Hollywood sign."</TE>
<TE>   Then, too, I assume residents will want to shun the name anyway
because of all the gibes that would be recalled, like this from comic
Oscar Levant: "Strip the phony tinsel off Hollywood and you'll find
the real tinsel underneath."</TE>
<TE>   And so, in still another public service, I'm willing to take
nominations for a new name for L.A.'s glitzy neighbor-to-be.</TE>
<TE>   Offsides! It was two years ago that a bizarre billboard began
popping up all over town (see photo). Others also carried strange
messages, including one that warned that "eight Oklahoma tourists"
would be "beaten" in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   They turned out to be ads for the Arena Football League. Well, the
L.A. Avengers resume play next month, but the billboards have been
toned down.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did they draw protests from residents, but some
backfired. For instance, the "Oklahoma tourists" (i.e. the Oklahoma
Outlaws), far from being beaten, whipped the Avengers, 59-33.</TE>
<TE>   Sacre bleu! I like butter as much as the next person. But, as
Allen St. James points out, there should be a little dough in a
croissant too (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   A real estate agent who gets personal: A typo on a junk mailing
(see accompanying) prompted Pamela Rothschild of Beverly Hills to
quip: "This is the best offer I've had in years."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of drainage problems: Ric Sarabia has a bitty--not to
mention gritty--part in a coming episode of TV's "ER" in which he
plays a drunk who urinates on himself. He saw the magic of show biz
up close and personal.</TE>
<TE>   Sarabia wore a backpack contraption under his jacket.</TE>
<TE>   "Turk, the special-effects guy, started the flow via remote
control just off camera," Sarabia marveled. "I didn't even have to
set it off myself. Man, all you do is 'act' on that show--what a
Cadillac production!"</TE>
<TE>   Incidentally, the backpack contained Windex. Showed up better on
camera than water, he was told.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The Long Beach Press-Telegram reports that Democrat
Peter Mathews is disputing his loss in the 37th Congressional
District primary. Many voters may have been "disenfranchised" through
election snafus, Mathews said. How many? He received 22% of the vote
to incumbent Rep. Juanita Millender-McDonald's 78%.</TE>

<HD>Sheldon Otis, 69; Lawyer Defended Radicals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheldon Otis, a criminal defense lawyer who waged courtroom battles
for some of the 1970s' most prominent radicals, including Angela
Davis and Huey Newton, died of congestive heart failure March 1 at
Kaiser Hospital in Oakland. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   He was the lead defense attorney for Steven Soliah, an associate
of the Symbionese Liberation Army who was acquitted in 1976 at trial
over a Carmichael, Calif., bank robbery that left a woman dead.</LD>
<LD>   Soliah was the only person tried in the 1970s for the robbery,
which resulted in the fatal shooting of a bank customer, Myrna
Opsahl. The case was resurrected recently with the arrests on
first-degree murder charges of three other former SLA members and
Soliah's sister, Sara Jane Olson.</LD>
<TE>   Although in declining health since undergoing quadruple heart
bypass surgery several years ago, Otis was intrigued by the new
developments in the 1975 case.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a mood of antagonism against anyone that they
can label as a terrorist," he told The Times in January after the
arrests of Olson, Emily Harris, William Harris and Michael Bortin.</TE>
<TE>   Otis was a Detroit native and graduate of Wayne State University,
where he earned his law degree. He quickly became a top member of
Detroit's defense bar, racking up acquittals in more than 20 cases.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, a year after moving to Berkeley for a job with the Legal
Aid Society in San Mateo County, he joined the Angela Davis defense
team. The black militant had been charged with murder, kidnapping and
conspiracy in a 1970 shootout in which four people, including a
judge, were killed. Otis helped to organize the case and gave the
arguments on some early defense motions.</TE>
<TE>   "His help in the case was fantastic. He was a very brilliant
lawyer," said Howard R. Moore Jr., who led the Davis defense.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was acquitted in June 1972.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1970s, Otis helped to negotiate Newton's return from
self-imposed exile in Cuba to face murder charges stemming from the
1974 shooting of an Oakland prostitute. Otis left the case in 1978
before it went to trial. The Black Panther leader, who went through
two mistrials in the case, was killed in a street shooting in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Otis represented Soliah, who had lived with Patricia
Hearst while she was an SLA fugitive. Otis was able to persuade a
federal jury that Soliah was innocent despite the testimony of two
bank employees who had identified him as one of four robbers who had
stormed the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Otis credited his successful defense in part to long hours of
practice in a mock courtroom he installed in the basement of his
Victorian-style office building in San Francisco's Pacific Heights
district.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe a lawyer wins a case, although a lawyer can blow
a case," Otis, considered a master of courtroom technique, once told
the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   He used the mock courtroom to hone the skills of his younger
associates, videotaping them to make them aware of weaknesses in
their presentation. He also put witnesses through their paces there,
rehearsing questioning to help them avoid potentially harmful
mannerisms, such as failing to look the jury in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a daughter, Dana Otis-Heirich, of Palo Alto; a
son, Michael, of Sacramento; and two granddaughters.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Series Cries for a Game 7</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've probably heard that Tuesday's election in Orange County was
the death knell for an El Toro airport. That kind of talk disturbs me
because I predicted in 1998 that the airport issue would be decided
in a best-of-seven election series stretching to 2014.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, we'd had two elections. Since that prophecy, we've
had two more. Tuesday's vote against the airport merely knotted the
series at 2-2.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, this thing is just getting interesting.</LD>
<TE>   You didn't see baseball calling off the World Series last fall
when the Yankees and Diamondbacks were tied up 2-2. How would we have
had a thrilling Game 7 without Games 5 and 6?</TE>
<TE>   Besides, "El Toro" has become part of our local lexicon. Many
people won't know how to get along without it.</TE>
<TE>   The debate has pumped millions of dollars into the local economies
of consultants and lawyers. Scrap the debate and you're going to see
a lot more bedraggled people standing on street corners with signs
reading, "Will Consult on El Toro for Food."</TE>
<TE>   Seems like just 1995, doesn't it, when the county first voted on
El Toro? Actually, it was 1994, and the pro-airport forces squeaked
out a victory.</TE>
<TE>   How much younger and innocent we all were then.</TE>
<TE>   No one had ever heard of Monica Lewinsky or the Backstreet Boys.
No one had shopped at the Block at Orange or driven a local toll
road. George Bush was a governor, and Gray Davis wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   To show you how time flies when you're planning an airport, the
entire five-member Board of Supervisors has turned over since that
'94 vote. One of them (Tom Riley) has died, and another (Gaddi
Vasquez) now runs the Peace Corps. The airport's chief financial
backer is now U.S. ambassador to Spain. The county has a new sheriff
and district attorney and has had four CEOs. Robert Citron was
considered an investment wizard, and Bob Dornan was the face of
county Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   But today ...</TE>
<TE>   It's probably best not to delude ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   It's probably time to let go.</TE>
<TE>   I'm game for Election No. 5, but it's just not going to happen.
The fire is out of the pro-airport people, except for those hardy,
perennial warriors who watch "Braveheart" every night on video. Tell
them another El Toro election is possible, and they'll paint their
faces blue and white and dress in kilts.</TE>
<TE>   The thinking combatants, however, know the end game is upon them.
This time, their defeat was too crushing.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the anti-airport crowd win handily in passing Measure
W, 58% to 42%, but it also KOd Cynthia Coad, the North County
chairman of the board and an El Toro supporter, replacing her with
anti-airport guy Chris Norby.</TE>
<TE>   Coad's defeat leaves only board colleagues Chuck Smith and Jim
Silva to fight the good fight.</TE>
<TE>   Silva wants to be taken alive, however, and said before Tuesday's
election that the county should give up on the airport if Measure W
passed. Coad will serve out the year, but there's nothing for her to
do on El Toro, and she also has said she'd respect Measure W's
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   So, as fun as this whole series has been (And we've had some
laughs, haven't we?), it must end.</TE>
<TE>   It's a bitter pill for airport forces, who thought they had this
thing in their hip pocket as recently as 1996.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, I met with Larry Agran, as fierce a partisan in this
eight-year fight as there is. He was all hearts and flowers, however,
saying supporters of the Great Park idea embodied in Measure W would
work to "include everybody in trying to implement this consensus
vision" for the county.</TE>
<TE>   He wondered if the other side would fight on. I said I doubted it.</TE>
<TE>   But then, two glimmers were spotted.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Lichman, an attorney who I once feared would attack Agran
in a debate and bite off his ear, said legal challenges are possible.
And Mark Pisano, executive director of the Southern California Assn.
of Governments, told a Times reporter that Measure W "doesn't
necessarily end the possibility of an airport at El Toro."</TE>
<TE>   Mirages? False hope? Dare we dream of a Game 5?</TE>
<TE>   My head says no.</TE>
<TE>   But my heart?</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to an old friend like El Toro, it's just hard to let
go.</TE>

<LD>A community memorial for slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel
Pearl, originally scheduled for Saturday at Birmingham High School in
Van Nuys, has been postponed to give organizers more time to plan the
event.</LD>
<LD>   An assistant principal at Birmingham High, Pearl's alma mater,
said it will reschedule the memorial for sometime in the next few
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Civic leaders and school organizations have indicated they will
participate in the program, Assistant Principal Marsha Rybin said. A
representative of the Pearl family also is expected to attend.</LD>
<TE>   Pearl was an academic star at Birmingham High, where he was named
a National Merit scholar and won a Bank of America award for
excellence. He later graduated from Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped
in the Pakistani port city of Karachi on Jan. 23 while investigating
local ties between alleged "shoe bomber" Richard Reid and Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, a previously unknown group that called itself the
National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty sent
out the first of two e-mails that included photographs of Pearl in
captivity. The abductors demanded the release of all Pakistani
prisoners taken by U.S. forces in Afghanistan and the freeing of the
former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 30, after these demands were not met, the group sent
photos of Pearl with a gun to his head, along with a threat to
execute him within 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   When that deadline was not met, the abductors carried out their
threat.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was forced to read a prepared statement denouncing the U.S.
presence in Afghanistan and American support for Israel before his
throat was cut and he was decapitated.</TE>
<TE>   A grisly videotape showing Pearl's execution was delivered to the
U.S. Consulate in Karachi. His body has not been found.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have promised that the perpetrators will be tracked
down and brought to justice.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Wall Street Journal said a fund has been
established for Pearl's family and their charities. Donations should
be sent to the Daniel Pearl Family Foundation, care of the Wall
Street Journal, P.O. Box 300, Princeton, NJ 08543.</TE>

<LD>Five residents who sued after their homes were threatened or damaged
by a hillside collapse during El Nino storms in 1998 have filed two
additional lawsuits against both the city and the developer of a
256-acre residential project at Pacific Point.</LD>
<LD>   One lawsuit alleges that the project has been abandoned by SunCal
Cos. of Anaheim and asks that the developer's $6.34-million surety
bond be used to stabilize the Meredith Canyon hillside.</LD>
<LD>   The other suit seeks an injunction to prevent the city from
spending public funds to process applications or to issue any other
permits for Pacific Point.</LD>

<LD>City officials this week approved spending $2.1 million to buy the
old Oxnard High School and are now crafting a plan for how the
facility will be used.</LD>
<LD>   The 33-acre former campus at 5th and H streets now houses several
nonprofit groups, including a Police Activities League chapter that
hosts youth dances and other after-school events.</LD>
<LD>   Karen Burnham, Oxnard's assistant city manager, said officials
want to work with the groups now on campus and with nearby residents
to create a use plan for the property.</LD>
<TE>   The city received state approval in December to buy the site from
the Oxnard Union High School District for $2.1 million, about half
its $4-million appraised value.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. has amended its plan for reorganizing its
finances, scaling back a sweeping proposal to preempt dozens of state
laws and regulations.</LD>
<LD>   The company altered its plan in response to a bankruptcy judge's
ruling against the utility's request for broad permission to preempt
state law.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E said it would not seek preemption of environmental, health
and safety regulations, but would try to get around state laws
regulating sale of property and assets.</LD>
<TE>   A hearing on the amended plan is scheduled for March 26.</TE>

<LD>Linda Wheaton, head of the policy division of the state's Department
of Housing and Community Development, heard complaints from county
officials during a meeting of the local Council of Governments.</LD>
<LD>   The locals insisted it was inconceivable for San Luis Obispo
County to meet the state's demand for at least 18,900 new homes by
2008. The Council of Governments, as it did with the higher number in
January, voted Wednesday to reject the latest figure.</LD>
<LD>   The local proposal is 10,360, which some of the elected officials
still consider unrealistic.</LD>

<LD>A 39-year-old man kidnapped his estranged wife and their two
daughters from their Lomita home with the aid of his teenage son from
a previous marriage and another accomplice, authorities said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Delacruz, his 19-year-old son, Alejo Delacruz, and another
man took Adriana Galindo, 27, and her children from a home in the
24800 block of Woodward Avenue near Pacific Coast Highway about 6:50
p.m. Wednesday, said Sheriff's Lt. Cathy Renner.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Delacruz forced Galindo and their girls, Ariane Delacruz, 1,
and Gypsy Delacruz, 3, into a black 1995 Chevrolet Suburban and drove
away, Renner said.</LD>
<TE>   Jose Delacruz has a history of spousal abuse, authorities said,
and they fear for the safety of Galindo and her children.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been heard in the past saying, 'If I can't have you, nobody
will,'" Sgt. Randolph Springer said.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Delacruz is 5 feet 7, weighs about 185 pounds, has black hair
and brown eyes, and was last seen wearing a black jacket and black
pants. His son is 5 feet 6 and weighs 145 pounds. No description was
available for the third suspect.</TE>
<TE>   The Suburban's California license plate is 4MIT716.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information may call the sheriff's Lomita station at
(310) 539-1661.</TE>

<LD>A man described by police as delusional and possibly suicidal was
arrested in Oxnard after firing shots into a van carrying four
people, including two small children, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   No one was injured in the attack that began about 9 p.m. Wednesday
when the suspect, David Anthony Ramkissoon, 31, of Bakersfield,
allegedly rear-ended a van at the intersection of Wooley Road and A
Street.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Ramkissoon became angry when one of the passengers got
out to talk to him.</LD>
<TE>   "He became verbally aggressive, and when the passenger went back
to his vehicle, the suspect fired several gunshots at his car for no
reason," said Cmdr. Scott Whitney of the Oxnard Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Whitney said the van sped off, and the driver called 911 on her
cell phone. The gunman followed the van to a parking lot in the 2500
block of Ventura Road in Port Hueneme and fired with a semi-automatic
pistol, hitting the van several times, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers from Oxnard and Port Hueneme converged on the scene.
Authorities said Ramkissoon, who was driving a blue pickup truck,
fled north on Ventura Road to Wooley Road, where he hit the center
median.</TE>
<TE>   "His car got stranded on the center median, and the officers set
up a containment of the scene," Whitney said.</TE>
<TE>   "They tried to negotiate with him but he was noncompliant. We
called in SWAT teams and hostage negotiators," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramkissoon barricaded himself in his truck and refused to
surrender, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police sealed off surrounding roads during the negotiations and
Ramkissoon surrendered about midnight. He complained of back pain and
was taken to Ventura County Medical Center, where he was listed in
good condition Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Police Lt. Bryan Roberts said his department received an
anonymous call Wednesday warning that a suicidal man in a blue truck
was heading for Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   The van occupants, who asked police not to be identified, included
a 63-year-old man, a 55-year-old woman, an 8-year-old boy and a
2-year-old boy. Police do not believe the attacker knew the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Ramkissoon was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.</TE>

<HD>Carrying the GOP Banner, Simon Seeks Wider Appeal</HD>
<DH>Politics: His focus on education is a bid to win back women
who have abandoned Republican candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--Bill Simon Jr. set off on his first tour of California as
the Republican gubernatorial nominee Thursday, visiting schools
around the state to tout his education proposals and assail the
record of Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   In Sacramento and the suburbs of San Francisco and San Diego,
Simon offered no new details about his education plans. But his
immediate focus on schools in his race against the Democratic
incumbent made it clear that he views education as a key to winning
back the voters--particularly women--who have abandoned Republicans
in recent California elections.</LD>
<LD>   It also reflected Simon's effort to undercut Davis on an issue the
governor has made his top priority. At a magnet school in Sacramento,
Simon suggested that Davis deserves little credit for the rise in
test scores on his watch.</LD>
<TE>   "If you look at the test results that he says have improved, I
think that ignores the fact that still--nationally--we rank in the
basement," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   But California does not need to increase school spending, said
Simon, who is pushing for tax cuts at a time when the state faces a
$17-billion budget shortfall. Government, he said, should be kept "as
small as humanly possible."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's schools agenda, although somewhat vague, includes a
breakup of California's largest school districts--including Los
Angeles--a rollback of state education mandates, state intervention
in failing schools and more clear student performance standards.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, the governor's chief political strategist, dismissed
Simon's school visits as an attempt "to divert attention from all his
right-wing views on social issues." Among them, South said, are
Simon's opposition to abortion rights and gun control and his support
for privatization of some public services, including highway
construction.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder if these are schools that he wants private companies to
take over," South said, referring to Simon's support for a takeover
of some public schools by commercial corporations.</TE>
<TE>   South also criticized Simon for supporting vouchers that would
allow public school students to attend private schools, a concept
rejected by California voters in a November 2000 referendum.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, Simon has not included vouchers in his education agenda.
"The people of California have spoken on vouchers," he said in
Sacramento after a class of first-graders read to him from a book
called "Mr. Lee."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's focus on schools had two goals--to appeal to the chief
concern cited by voters, and also to broaden his political base
beyond the conservative Republicans who powered his primary victory.</TE>
<TE>   Women have been a particularly difficult target for Republicans in
recent California races. They were key to Davis' landslide victory in
1998 over Republican rival Dan Lungren, whose positions on abortion
and guns were similar to Simon's. Although men favored Davis over
Lungren 53% to 42%, women backed Davis over the Republican by 62% to
35%, according to the Times poll of voters on election day.</TE>
<TE>   GOP strategist Tony Quinn said education is perhaps the best issue
available to Simon to mitigate the problem of his unpopular position
on abortion among women.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to identify himself strategically with issues that women
are concerned with," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   A Times poll last month found education to be the most important
issue to California voters, but most of all among women. In the
survey, 46% of women named education as the issue they most wanted
candidates to address. Among men, 29% held that view.</TE>
<TE>   Since Simon won the GOP nomination on Tuesday, he has made
education his most visible priority. His first campaign stop
Wednesday was at a school in Los Angeles. On Thursday, all three of
his public events were at schools.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Davis has tried to keep the campaign agenda on
abortion and other issues on which his positions--Davis favors
abortion rights--are more closely aligned with most Californians.
Simon, though, has steadfastly avoided them.</TE>
<TE>   On the front steps of Burlingame High School in an affluent area
south of San Francisco, Simon responded to a question on abortion by
saying he was concerned about the economy, schools, roads, water and
power. He said he believed most voters share those concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the school, some students had greeted Simon with banners
saying: "Guns Kill" and "Women's Right to Choose."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe what he's advocating," said Sara McNamara, 17.
"Women are going to go back to using coat hangers."</TE>
<TE>   Several dozen more friendly students mobbed Simon as he tried to
make his way down the hallway in a cluster of television cameras and
microphones.</TE>
<TE>   "OK guys, it's not the Beatles," Simon joked.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he was impressed that the school had raised private
money to replace its football field and fix its swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a perfect example of private solutions, public-private
partnerships," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, Simon deflected questions about his conservative
profile by talking about Davis' job performance as governor.</TE>
<TE>   "The campaign ought to be about Gray Davis' record with respect to
the issues that he's dealt with," Simon said, then again ticked off
his agenda. "First and foremost, you talk about the budget, then you
talk about schools, and then you talk about our roads, our water, and
our power."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really a matter of left or right," he added. "It's a
matter of moving forward."</TE>

<HD>'Martyrs' Leading War on Israel</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Brigade linked to Arafat has recently waged more attacks
than Islamic extremist groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Ibrahim Abeiyat started his day by ordering the killing of a Jewish
settler. Around noon, he moved about town openly, if carefully, gathering
intelligence and procuring weapons. After nightfall, he hunkered down
with his men while Israeli warplanes bombarded Bethlehem's main police
headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   As a local commander of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, Abeiyat is one of
scores of guerrilla fighters who have assumed the lead in the war
Palestinians are waging against Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The majority of recent deadly attacks on Israeli soldiers and
civilians--and some of the most brazen--have been carried out by the Al
Aqsa brigade, an underground militia affiliated with the Fatah movement
of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   The Palestinian operations--along with a massive Israeli military
offensive--have helped fuel a stunning escalation in bloodletting that
has claimed more than 1,200 lives in 17 months. Palestinians and Israelis
are attacking and counterattacking at a dizzying pace, and both sides
have threatened more.</TE>
<TE>   "We will hit the Israelis where it hurts the most," Abeiyat said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Abeiyat and his comrades began using the name Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade
a few weeks after the current conflict erupted in September 2000. Al Aqsa
is the revered mosque in Jerusalem where the fighting began after Ariel
Sharon, now Israel's prime minister, and a small army of police entered
the compound where the mosque is located. The compound is considered holy
by Jews and Muslims, and Muslims saw Sharon's visit as sacrilege.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people were being killed, there was a need to stand up and
take revenge," said Abeiyat, 29.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the Al Aqsa brigade focused its attacks within the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, targeting symbols of occupation: military roadblocks and
Jewish settlers. Later, however, as the militia's ranks evidently
swelled, civilians within Israel proper were added to the list of
targets.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Al Aqsa brigade includes coolheaded snipers, guerrilla
commandos, suicide bombers and even a unit of female fighters--the only
one in this conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The "brigade" is in fact numerous cells formed locally in towns and
refugee camps across the West Bank and Gaza Strip. There appears to be
little operational coordination among the cells, but members share
nominal allegiance--though not total obedience--to the Fatah leadership.
Brigade members are less willing than Fatah to compromise for peace with
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa brigade is an offshoot of the Tanzim, Fatah's armed wing.
Arafat created the Tanzim in 1995 as a counterbalance to the growing
power of the military wings of radical Islamic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Al Aqsa guerrillas cut their teeth in the first intifada,
the six-year uprising against Israeli military occupation that ended in
1993 with the advent of the Oslo peace process. And many were further
hardened in Israeli jails.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after the Palestinian Authority was formed and given control of
part of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, many joined the Palestinian police
and security forces, which received training and equipment from U.S. and
European advisors.</TE>
<TE>   The superior training and availability of weapons gave them an edge in
guerrilla tactics over the extremist Islamic groups that, until recently,
had carried out nearly all of the suicide bombing attacks.</TE>
<TE>   By one Israeli analyst's count, the militant Islamic movement Hamas
carried out 100 attacks in 2001 and Fatah militias 80; in the first 60
days of this year, Fatah had carried out 51, Hamas 10.</TE>
<TE>   In their operations, the Al Aqsa guerrillas hope to restore Fatah's
popularity, which had slipped in relation to Hamas in recent months. But
the surging activity of Fatah militias poses a political problem for
Arafat. He cannot claim the same distance from these armed groups as he
has from the Islamic factions--and in fact benefits domestically as Fatah
gains strength. But he has shown no inclination to rein them
in--something that would be difficult given the decentralized character
of the Al Aqsa cadres.</TE>
<TE>   Nasser abu Hmeid is an especially popular militia commander in the
West Bank city of Ramallah. He said that although most members are Fatah,
the group doesn't consider itself committed to the same international
agreements and treaties--namely, the Oslo peace accords--that Arafat
signed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a military wing," he said, "and we do not want to be obligated
to any political line."</TE>
<TE>   Hmeid, 30, spent 14 years in an Israeli prison, serving nine life
sentences for the slaying of 10 Palestinians he suspected of having
collaborated with Israel. He was freed in 1999 as part of a
prisoner-release deal and worked in the Palestinian Authority's Ministry
for Prisoner Affairs until the current uprising.</TE>
<TE>   He made a semipublic appearance in Ramallah this week at the funeral
for an Al Aqsa commander who was killed when an Israeli helicopter fired
a missile into his car. Abu Hmeid and most other militia chiefs assume
that they are on Israel's hit list. Israel holds them responsible for the
deaths of scores of its citizens.</TE>
<TE>   As the funeral procession geared up and shouts of "Allahu akbar!" (God
is great!) rang out, Abu Hmeid kept to the sidelines. He sat cross-legged
on the ground under a cypress tree, an M-16 on his lap, five bodyguards
arrayed in a semicircle behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Both Abu Hmeid, in Ramallah, and Abeiyat, in Bethlehem, defended the
decision of some members of the organization to target civilians,
including children, in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv, even though the official
Fatah line is to restrict attacks to the West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as Israel keeps hitting our civilians, we have no choice but
to go after their civilians," Abu Hmeid said.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim Hassouna, a 21-year-old officer in the Palestinian navy,
joined the Al Aqsa brigade in the hard-line West Bank city of Nablus. On
Tuesday, Hassouna charged into an upscale restaurant in Tel Aviv, guns
ablaze. He killed three Israelis before being shot dead by a policeman,
who was himself mortally wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Al Aqsa claimed credit for the first two female suicide bombers in the
uprising. One, Dareen abu Aisheh, had belonged to Hamas, but when the
Islamic fundamentalists wouldn't let a woman do the job, she switched to
Al Aqsa.</TE>
<TE>   Al Aqsa also claimed responsibility when a resident of the Dahaisha
refugee camp outside Bethlehem, Mohammed Daraghma, waded into a crowd of
women and children in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem
and detonated a powerful bomb strapped to his body. He and 10 Israelis,
including two infants and other children, were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Abeiyat said Daraghma was acting out of rage and depression over the
shooting death of his best friend, killed by Israeli soldiers in a clash
at Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem. Abeiyat said that it wasn't the kind of
operation he prefers but that he recognizes it as part of the struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Abeiyat acknowledged ordering the shooting of settlers this week on a
road that skirts Bethlehem. On Tuesday, Dvora Friedman was killed and her
husband injured. Abeiyat said the shooting was in retaliation for
Israel's repeated bombardment of a security complex in central Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   Abeiyat, who comes from a large, rough clan that lives on the rural
eastern edge of Bethlehem, joined Fatah at 15, was in jail by the time he
was 17 and took up guns against Israel when he joined the Al Aqsa
brigade.</TE>
<TE>   He was interviewed in a souvenir shop on Bethlehem's Manger Square,
across from the Church of the Nativity. Abeiyat wore black, the
unofficial uniform of the Al Aqsa brigade, a Belgian-made Browning pistol
on his hip. He spoke occasionally into a red cellular phone and smoked
steadily. His bodyguard was armed with an AK-47.</TE>
<TE>   Abeiyat became a commander after succeeding one cousin, Atef, who was
killed in an Israeli assassination in October. Israel blamed Atef for
several slayings of settlers. Atef had succeeded another cousin, Hussein,
who was killed by Israel in November 2000. Hussein is considered the
first target of Israel's controversial assassination policy, in which
Israeli forces hunt down and kill suspected militants.</TE>
<TE>   As horrific as the suicide bombings are, it is a string of attacks on
the army that has most unnerved Israel's military establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting a gradual sophistication in Palestinian tactics, cadres of
the Al Aqsa brigade have repeatedly attacked Israeli military roadblocks
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, some of which are isolated and exposed.</TE>
<TE>   Six soldiers were killed in one such raid, and seven more soldiers and
three settlers in another 12 days later. In both, the assailants escaped,
apparently unscathed. Three tank crewmen were killed in an ambush on an
Israeli Merkava tank in the Gaza Strip last month, also attributed to the
Al Aqsa brigade.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the attacks came in response to Israel's incursions into two
refugee camps, members of the brigade said. Israeli operations, they
said, are fueling more and more Palestinian resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "We are gaining experience in military activities by the day," said
Maged Masri, another Al Aqsa commander based at the Balata refugee camp
in the West Bank city of Nablus. The camp was raided by Israeli forces
last week. Masri is a former police officer who said he's been armed and
ready to fight since well before the current uprising.</TE>
<TE>   "We had dozens of martyrdom fighters [those who will carry out suicide
attacks] before," he said from the Balata camp, where he and other gunmen
returned once the Israelis pulled out. "But now they are in the hundreds
and thousands."</TE>

<HD>Simple Mission Became 18-Hour Fight</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Flawed intelligence may have put unit in line of enemy
fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The soldiers of the Army's 10th Mountain Division thought they were
headed to the back door of the battle of Shahi Kot in eastern
Afghanistan, on a mission to pick off fighters who might try to escape
the main battle.</LD>
<LD>   But within minutes of bounding out of their choppers at 6 a.m.
Saturday, the infantrymen were bombarded with intense small-arms, mortar
and rocket-propelled grenade fire from Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts dug
into the cliffs above.</LD>
<LD>   For the next 18 hours, they were trapped by an enemy force--and faulty
intelligence may have been partly to blame.</LD>
<TE>   "Throughout the whole day, [it was] RPG rounds, machine guns, mortar
rounds landing just everywhere," Sgt. 1st Class Robert Healy said.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably wouldn't tell my mom the exact truth," Healy said of the
battle. "I wouldn't want to worry her too much."</TE>
<TE>   Healy, 34, and Command Sgt. Maj. Frank Grippe, 39, both injured by
shrapnel in the battle, spoke with reporters Thursday via a satellite
phone link from Bagram air base north of the Afghan capital, Kabul, where
the commanders of U.S. forces waging the battle are based.</TE>
<TE>   The first mortar round wounded about six men, the second the same
number, despite the torso-protecting body armor the infantrymen wore,
said Healy, of Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Under intense pressure from the withering fire, the Americans quickly
took what cover they could find on the barren valley floor and began
shooting back at fighters on the snowcapped ridgelines high above.</TE>
<TE>   Healy, Grippe and dozens of others from the Army's elite mountain
fighting unit had embarked with no expectation of such fierce resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Their mission was to form "blocking positions" in the valley, a
military term for blocking the enemy's possible escape. Theirs was an
opening move in Operation Anaconda, designed to encircle Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters in an area of 60 to 70 square miles--and then crush
them.</TE>
<TE>   Allied Afghan forces were supposed to have flushed Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters from strongholds toward the U.S. forces, but the Afghans
also came under enemy fire and never made it to their position, the
soldiers said.</TE>
<TE>   Grippe, the senior enlisted man on the ground in the battle, said
about 125 men were carried into the valley aboard CH-47 Chinook
helicopters. He ordered "hunter-killer" sniper teams placed along the
valley to the south, and men from the Army's 101st Airborne Division took
up positions in the northern part of the valley, Grippe said.</TE>
<TE>   The pre-battle picture painted by intelligence briefers "was just a
little bit different than the actual events happening on the ground,"
said Grippe, of New York. His men landed, he said, "at the base of an Al
Qaeda stronghold."</TE>
<TE>Size of Enemy Force Was Underestimated</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a senior military officer with knowledge of the
operation said flawed intelligence and analysis put the soldiers in the
vulnerable spot.</TE>
<TE>   "They were supposed to be the blocking force," the officer said. "And
all of a sudden, they found themselves at the bottom of a valley with
fire raining down on them from these guys in entrenched positions on a
mountainside. They basically had them pinned down for 18 hours."</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence failure was one of several that plagued commanders
leading the ground assault in the mountains near Gardez, in eastern
Afghanistan, the officer said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some faulty intelligence and analysis indicating that the
opposing force was smaller than it was," the official said. "We would
hope to have had a better sense of the force size."</TE>
<TE>   The official added: "There was also a sense that if confronted with a
ground force, that these guys would choose to bail, that if they had good
escape routes staked out, they would break and run. . . . But it didn't
work out. So we had to regroup and rethink."</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Thursday defended the
intelligence gathering that went into the operation, for which U.S.
forces had been preparing for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very difficult to know the number of Al Qaeda and Taliban that
are there . . . the numbers have been changing dramatically--that is, the
speculation as to how many are there," Rumsfeld told Pentagon employees
at a "town hall" meeting. "And I suspect we will not know how many are in
there until it's over."</TE>
<TE>   For the U.S. soldiers in the valley, the barrage from dark-clothed
fighters hidden on snowy ridges and in mountainside caves was brutal.</TE>
<TE>   Ten minutes into the battle, with the infantrymen dodging bullets and
mortar fire, Al Qaeda fighters "came out of caves and well-fortified
positions," Grippe said. "We experienced a heavy volume of fire from the
mountains above us. We returned fire, and we did kill Al Qaeda elements."</TE>
<TE>   "We all ducked behind kind of a small bowl area with cover and
concealment on pretty much four sides," Healy said. "Everybody got
organized and we started returning fire."</TE>
<TE>Soldiers Recall Acts of Bravery</TE>
<TE>   Within about 30 minutes, U.S. fighter jets, bombers, AH-64 Apache
helicopters and AC-130 gunships started plowing the skies overhead,
Grippe said. "That quieted things down. We finally got some Apache
aircraft to help us out."</TE>
<TE>   The infantrymen used 7.62-millimeter sniper rifles and machine guns to
beat back their foe, Grippe said.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually witnessed some of my guys taking out Al Qaeda targets out
to ranges of 500 meters," Grippe said. "So they really did a good job.
They stayed cool under fire."</TE>
<TE>   "Basically I'll tell you, we didn't run from the fight. It wasn't a
Mogadishu," he said, referring to the ill-fated 1993 incident in Somalia
in which the U.S. military evacuated the country after taking heavy
casualties. "We just kept the enemy fixed all day and kept the CAS [close
air support] coming, and any time we could actually visibly see a target,
we'd eliminate that Al Qaeda element."</TE>
<TE>   There were many instances of bravery, the solders said. During one of
the mortar rounds, Healy, Grippe and about six or seven other men moved
to a different position to avoid more fire.</TE>
<TE>   "So we pushed away," Healy said. "About five of the guys from Charlie
Company, they stayed up on the ridgeline and they were receiving sniper
fire and machine-gun fire, rounds were bouncing all around them, but they
stayed there to cover our movement. None of them faltered. They knew they
could get hit at any time, but they stayed there and held their ground
and made sure we got out of there."</TE>
<TE>   Grippe said the firefight continued from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m., when his
wounded men were taken out. After being trapped for four more hours, he
and the remainder of his forces were airlifted out of the battle area at
midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Grippe had been hit by shrapnel in the back of his thigh.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I'll be setting off airport metal detectors the rest of my
life," he said. Once his wounds heal, he said, he intends to head back
into the mountains with his men.</TE>
<TE>   "Our infantry fought very well that day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Healy, hit by shrapnel in the leg, shoulder and behind the ear, said
he and his fellow soldiers were fortunate to be facing a foe with more
determination than marksmanship.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't think it would be that high a volume of fire coming at us,"
Healy said. "Luckily, they weren't accurate shots."</TE>

<HD>Violence Escalates in Fresh Round of Bloody Attacks</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Palestinian gunman kills five in a Jewish settlement,
while Israeli attacks in Gaza, West Bank reportedly kill dozens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>A lone Palestinian gunman slipped inside a Jewish settlement in the
Gaza Strip late Thursday night, killing five Israeli students and
wounding 23 people on a day of violence that seemed to bring Israelis and
Palestinians to the brink of all-out war.</LD>
<LD>   Since Thursday morning, more than 30 Palestinians have died in the
fighting.</LD>
<LD>   Israel launched airstrikes and sent tanks and troops into the biblical
West Bank town of Bethlehem, neighboring Beit Jala and two refugee camps
in the area today, hours after the attack on the settlement.</LD>
<TE>   Troops also pushed into Gazan villages. Sixteen Palestinians were
killed today in the southern Gazan village of Khuzaa, Palestinians
reported, including Maj. Gen. Ahmed Mefrej, chief of Palestinian national
security forces in the southern Gaza Strip. Three more Palestinians, two
of them policemen and one an ambulance driver, were killed in the
northern Gaza Strip, the sources said. Dozens have been wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Thursday, Israel pressed its campaign to break Palestinian
militias and shake the foundations of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority, attacking towns, refugee camps and security positions. Fifteen
Palestinians were reportedly killed.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians continued their revenge attacks Thursday, with one
suicide bomber blowing himself up in the lobby of a hotel on the edge of
the West Bank's second-largest Jewish settlement, injuring 10 people, and
another being overpowered by the staff at a trendy Jerusalem restaurant
before he could detonate a large bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The deadliest attack on Israelis came at the settlement of Atzmona,
where a gunman later identified by Palestinians as Mohammed Farahat, 19,
of the militant Islamic movement Hamas opened fire at a pre-military
training academy for Israeli youths.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Radio reported that he fired his gun and threw grenades for
about 15 minutes before a squad of soldiers shot him to death.</TE>
<TE>   Before dawn today, Palestinians reported seeing Israeli tanks move
into Bethlehem and Beit Jala. Missiles were fired into security
buildings, and Palestinians reported that three people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The government launched its current offensive Monday, after a string
of deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis over the weekend. Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon vowed to "beat" the Palestinians until Israel
breaks the militias producing a seemingly endless stream of suicide
bombers and gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops took control Thursday of the West Bank town of Tulkarm
and two refugee camps on its outskirts. The army has branded the area a
hotbed of terrorism. Gun battles raged into the night there, and there
were reports that scores of Palestinian gunmen were trapped in one camp
as Israeli soldiers advanced.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians reported that 11 people, including two ambulance workers,
were killed in the fighting. Five of the dead were gunmen, according to
Palestinians. Four more Palestinians were reportedly killed late Thursday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said the bloodshed will continue.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an all-out terrorist onslaught against us," said Avi Pazner,
a government spokesman. "This . . . is a policy of trying to quell
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Arafat was defiant amid the growing
devastation around him.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can shake the Palestinians," he told reporters in the compound
where Israel has kept him confined for three months. "If the Israelis
believe that they can frighten them by tanks or by missiles or by Apaches
[helicopter gunships], then they are mistaken."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians showed no sign of seeking a halt in the fighting.
Even with their cities under siege, militants continued to attempt
revenge attacks Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In the late afternoon, a Palestinian walked into a hotel that is part
of a shopping mall at the entrance to the Jewish settlement of Ariel. The
bomber wounded 14 people, one of them seriously, and killed himself when
he detonated explosives strapped to his body. The Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist Palestinian organization, claimed
responsibility in a phone call to Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing came hours after a young Palestinian carrying a large
backpack walked into Caffit, a popular eatery in the upscale south
Jerusalem neighborhood of German Colony and asked for a glass of water.</TE>
<TE>   "A customer told me he looked suspicious," said Gaby Altaratz, 34, one
of Caffit's owners. "He was sweating profusely and looked nervous. I
walked up and asked him: 'What are you doing here?' " Altaratz said in an
interview. "He smiled and said: 'Who? Me?' His hands were all the time in
his pockets, and then I knew he was a terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   Altaratz, a waiter and a private security guard pulled the man outside
the restaurant, and the waiter, Shlomi Harel, pulled a wire from his
sleeve, detaching it from the backpack on one end and a switch on the
other, Altaratz said. They stripped off the man's jacket and pulled the
pack from his back.</TE>
<TE>   The three told patrons to evacuate the restaurant and restrained the
man until police arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Residents were shaken by the thwarted attack, which turned their
normally bustling neighborhood into an armed police camp for several
hours as police searched for other explosives.</TE>
<TE>   "This was one of the safe places in Jerusalem," said a downcast Menny
Benhaim, 31, an optometrist whose office is across the street from
Caffit. "People don't want to go downtown, they don't want to go to the
mall--now they won't want to come here, either. No place is safe."</TE>

<HD>Rebels' Arsenal Fuels Urban War Fears</HD>
<DH>Insurgency: Colombian guerrillas seek to use their increased
weapons expertise to influence upcoming elections, U.S. officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Colombian guerrillas are using a new generation of complex
explosives, including suspected poison gas on at least one occasion, to
mount a more aggressive style of urban warfare that they hope will allow
them to influence approaching elections, U.S. officials say.</LD>
<LD>   With training from members of the Irish Republican Army, the rebels
have learned to lob gas-filled mortar shells, the officials say. And the
guerrillas reportedly have picked up techniques for sabotaging members of
police and military bomb squads.</LD>
<LD>   In the course of a 38-year war, the Colombian rebel groups have
operated primarily in the countryside. But with outside help, the rebels
have honed their arms expertise, and there is growing fear that they will
use their new weapons to attack Colombian cities, U.S. officials say.</LD>
<TE>   Such attacks would be designed "to show that [the rebels] are a much
greater force than some people have thought," said one U.S. defense
official, who asked to remain unidentified. The rebels have been
pressuring voters ahead of legislative elections to be held Sunday and a
round of presidential elections scheduled for May 26.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials are now engaged in an internal debate
about what more they should do to help the Colombian government in a war
that involves two rebel groups, as well as several paramilitary
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   By law, the United States can provide military aid to Colombia to
fight drug trafficking there. But some U.S. officials believe that aid
should be sharply increased because of the terrorist threat the rebel
groups pose to those in the region and to Americans. They point to the
groups' growing weapons savvy as one sign of the dangers they pose.</TE>
<TE>   The know-how for building homemade mortars reached Colombia several
years ago through a roundabout route that U.S. officials say illustrates
how terrorist weapons technology flows around the world.</TE>
<TE>   IRA members first learned to use the mortars in terrorist training
camps in Libya more than a decade ago, officials say. They shared the
technique with Basque separatists in Spain, who in turn passed it on to
leftist rebels in El Salvador. Those rebels passed it to insurgents in
Nicaragua and Panama, who in turn were the first to show it to Colombian
rebels, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   A key source of the weapons expertise has been the IRA, which is
believed to have been training members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, the largest rebel group, since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The IRA members do not share a political ideology with the rebels, but
they are drawn to Colombia as a way of making money and testing their
weapons, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian rebels have used the expertise they gleaned from others
to make rudimentary mortar shells consisting of modified cooking-gas
canisters. A smaller canister, much like ones used on home barbecues, is
filled with explosives and shrapnel and fired from a larger canister that
functions like a mortar barrel.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels have been using these weapons to bombard police and army
buildings, though the canisters have often gone astray and struck homes,
often with deadly results. The weapons are highly imprecise, but they can
hurl canisters hundreds of yards.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe that the rebels are now using poison gas in a
more complex and deadly variant of the weapon. A gas such as chlorine can
damage the lungs in a brief exposure; concentrated in a confined space,
it can kill.</TE>
<TE>   In September, rebels used a gas-filled canister in an attack on a
police station in the southern town of San Adolfo, about 230 miles south
of Bogota, Colombia's capital. Four police officers were killed by the
gas, which was released in a closed space. Officials have theorized that
the substance was a poison gas or a tear gas made deadly by its
concentration.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Joaquin Correa, the local police commander, said in an interview
Thursday that evidence from the attack has been sent to a private
laboratory in the United States. "It could be months" before the lab
results are known, he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say the rebels are also learning how to strike at
authorities with booby-trapped explosives. Mortar canisters are being
rigged with delayed fuses so that they can be lobbed into a building
without exploding; when a bomb squad comes to deactivate them, the
canisters go off, a defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   And the rebels have learned how to detonate the canisters before they
hit the ground, raining shrapnel or other material on their targets,
officials say. The rebels have been known to use human feces in this way,
creating a crude biological weapon that frightens the target and spreads
infection, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Other than these devices, the Colombian rebels' weapons are primarily
Soviet-era small arms purchased from Middle Eastern weapons merchants or
left over from the Central American wars of the 1980s.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Envoy Returning to Region</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Decision to send Anthony Zinni back on peace mission
suggests new urgency by Bush administration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Responding to escalating violence, President Bush on Thursday
suddenly stepped up the administration's involvement in the Middle East,
announcing that he was dispatching his special envoy back to the region.</LD>
<LD>   The president had said he would not send retired Marine Corps Gen.
Anthony C. Zinni on a renewed mission while Israel and the Palestinian
territories were racked with violence. So, although there has been no
sign of calm, Bush's decision suggested a new urgency and the hope that
the heightened violence will push both sides toward new cooperation.</LD>
<LD>   Zinni will be working with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as Vice
President Dick Cheney embarks on a lengthy tour of the region, reflecting
the concerted effort the Bush administration is devoting to seeking peace
in a region it had been skittish about approaching.</LD>
<TE>   The effort follows a proposal by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia
for Arab nations to move forward with formal recognition of Israel in
exchange for a pullback by Israel from territories it has controlled
since the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, reading a statement to reporters in the White House Rose Garden,
said Abdullah's proposal "created an opening for discussing [a] broader
peace."</TE>
<TE>   Expressing concern "about the tragic loss of life and escalating
violence in the Middle East," Bush reiterated his call for Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat "to make a maximum effort to end
terrorism against Israel." He said he was counting on all parties in the
region, including Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, "to make these
efforts a success."</TE>
<TE>   "The violence and tragic loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives must
end," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a question, Bush said he had no assurances, after
recent consultations with leaders in the region, that a mission by Zinni
would be fruitful. The envoy is expected to visit Egypt and Jordan as
well as Israel and Palestinian territory.</TE>
<TE>   Israel welcomed Bush's decision, as did Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said Bush reversed course--after saying for several
weeks that conditions were not ripe for sending Zinni back to the Middle
East--for two reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The first is the escalating cycle of attacks during the last five
days, a State Department official said Thursday. In less than a week,
about 100 people have been killed, compared with more than 1,100 during
the first 17 months of renewed violence.</TE>
<TE>   "That shows a pace and a level of violence that we've never seen
before. So a new sense of urgency and tragedy about the situation was a
big factor," said the official, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also conceded that dispatching Zinni could deflect the
mounting criticism of the United States in the Arab world. The violence
was on the verge of overtaking the original focus of the Cheney trip,
which was to discuss U.S. opposition to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
with Arab governments in the Middle East and Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "It's safe to say that where Cheney might have had a multiple set of
talking points on a range of issues, it would have soon become a
conversation in which the VP's interlocutors wanted to discuss one issue
and one alone. It [Zinni's mission] certainly gives him something to
say," an administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Arab nations, there has been pressure on the U.S. for
several weeks to send Zinni back to the region. He was last there in
January.</TE>
<TE>   "In our conversations with them, it's been the position of the
Egyptians, Jordanians, Saudis and others that he needed to go back as
soon as possible," a senior State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Rose Garden, Bush reiterated his goal that both sides accept a
plan put forward by CIA Director George J. Tenet. This is a "work plan"
that would bring Israel and the Palestinian Authority into cooperation on
security--to the degree that existed before the latest Palestinian
uprising began in September 2000. The two sides would then move ahead to
broader discussions aimed at achieving a peaceful settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has demanded that there be seven days of calm before the Tenet
plan can go into effect. But waiting for seven days of calm is no longer
viable, U.S. officials said, emphasizing that the Israelis seem to have
edged away from that demand.</TE>

<HD>Philippines Narrows U.S. Hostage Search</HD>

<DL>MANILA
</DL>
<LD>Philippine armed forces, with U.S. assistance, have determined the
general location of two American hostages being held by Islamic militants
on the southern island of Basilan and are ready to launch operations to
free them, the country's chief military spokesman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Brig. Gen. Edilberto Adan said he expected new sightings of American
missionary couple Martin and Gracia Burnham to come quickly, now that
U.S. military personnel and high-technology surveillance and
communications equipment had arrived on the island.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe in the next few days," he said. "We have a good idea of the
general location of the Burnhams. We're now awaiting the results of our
latest initiatives."</LD>
<TE>   The Abu Sayyaf extremist group is holding a third hostage, a
Philippine nurse named Deborah Yap, seized from a hospital in Basilan a
few days after the Burnhams.</TE>
<TE>   Under a U.S.-Philippine agreement signed last month, 660 American
military personnel, along with aircraft and equipment, have been deployed
to the Philippines to help rescue the hostages and crush the Abu Sayyaf
rebels. A total of 160 U.S. Army Special Forces troops are on Basilan,
with the remaining 500 uniformed personnel in support elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "This has increased our awareness dramatically," Adan said.</TE>
<TE>   Adan described the new initiatives as a combination of three factors:
American P-3 surveillance aircraft patrolling overhead, U.S. specialists
now on the ground trained to interpret the electronic imagery gathered
from the sky, and the fruits of local informants who have been offered
rewards for information on the Burnhams' whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had the aircraft for a while, but there was no one on the
ground to interpret what they were picking up," Adan said. "Now they are
in place."</TE>
<TE>   The Manila newspaper Philippine Star posted a report on its Web site
late Thursday evening quoting the mayor of the remote Basilan village of
Maluso, who claimed that all three hostages had been seen last week
moving through the community. The report could not be independently
confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   A Philippine force of about 3,500 has been deployed on Basilan to
rescue the hostages and flush out or kill Abu Sayyaf members holding
them. The government estimates the group's strength at about 80 fighters.</TE>
<TE>   A far larger group of several hundred Abu Sayyaf fighters is believed
to be on the nearby island of Jolo.</TE>
<TE>   Although vastly outnumbered, the Islamic militants have avoided
detection and capture since taking the Burnhams in May. They've been
helped by the dense jungle that covers much of the island and by the fact
that the poorly equipped Philippine forces have been unable to react
quickly when the hostages have been sighted before.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Abu Sayyaf has been aided by the support of another
group of Muslim activists who share the goal of making the area an
independent Islamic homeland. On Thursday, a former Abu Sayyaf hostage
told a congressional hearing in Manila that he was handed over for a
month to members of the other, larger group, known as the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine military force, which includes marine and army units,
has only three helicopters, each capable of transporting only nine
soldiers, and communicates using old two-way radios that have a maximum
range of just over one mile.</TE>
<TE>   Adan said that with the arrival of the Americans, the rebels were
guarding their hostages with a new level of intensity.</TE>
<TE>   The terms of the U.S.-Philippine agreement, part of the American-led
effort to crush international terrorist groups, forbid the Americans from
engaging in combat, but they can defend themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The national television channel ABS-CBN released a videotape Thursday
of Martin Burnham reading a statement warning that Abu Sayyaf was
"targeting U.S. citizens, those from Europe and other nations" for a
variety of grievances, including Western support for Israel, sanctions
against Iraq and Libya, and the presence of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The TV station claimed that the video dated from mid-January, but many
questioned that timing.</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Sayyaf group, which first surfaced in the mid-1990s, has
financed its quest for an independent Muslim homeland by staging a series
of kidnappings for ransom. Senior U.S. officials have linked it to the Al
Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>

<HD>Iraq, U.N. Discuss Arms Inspections</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Talks end with no sign that Baghdad is willing to admit
weapons monitors, but meeting is cordial. Another session is planned next
month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>In the first high-level meeting between the United Nations and Iraq
in more than a year, the Iraqi foreign minister discussed U.N. demands
for weapons inspections with Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday,
but there were no indications that Baghdad was ready to drop its
objections to such scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   The nearly four hours of closed-door talks with Foreign Minister Naji
Sabri focused on the return of weapons inspectors to the country and
other "core issues" in the U.N.-Iraqi relationship, Annan spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.</LD>
<LD>   "The U.N. side raised the U.N.'s concerns, and we raised our own
concerns," Sabri said as he left U.N. headquarters en route back to the
Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   Although Thursday's meeting appeared inconclusive, it was cordial and
not confrontational, in contrast to the last high-level encounters
between U.N. and Iraqi officials, participants said.</TE>
<TE>   And it appears to have bought the Iraqis some valuable time, with
Annan agreeing to resume talks with Sabri in mid-April. That meeting will
be "based on a well-defined agenda agreed in advance," Eckhard said.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis sought Thursday's meeting in response to the threat of U.S.
military action against their country, Western diplomats and U.N.
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Annan, reflecting the stated views of most Security Council members,
said Thursday that he hoped U.S. military intervention could be averted
through negotiations and a resumption of inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "I would want to see a situation where we are able to resolve our
differences diplomatically and that Iraq comes into compliance," Annan
told reporters before the talks began. "I wouldn't want to see a widening
conflict in the region."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials said earlier that they would not consent to a second
round of talks with Sabri unless Iraq indicated some willingness to
reopen its doors to weapons inspectors, who left the country in December
1998.</TE>
<TE>   In the meeting Thursday in Annan's 38th-floor offices, the Iraqi
delegation met for the first time with the head of the U.N.'s recently
reorganized weapons inspections unit, Hans Blix, whose team hasn't been
allowed to visit Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Sabri nor Annan would divulge the results of Thursday's
discussions, which Annan termed "frank and useful" in a brief statement
issued afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Annan said he wouldn't speak publicly about the discussions until he
briefed the Security Council in a closed session this morning. But he
noted in his statement that Iraq had again asked for the lifting of U.N.
sanctions and an end to "no-fly" zones over much of the country.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials here reiterated Washington's view that Iraq must give
U.N. inspectors "free and unfettered access" to all relevant military
sites and documents but said they would defer further comment about the
meeting until after today's Security Council briefing.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, U.S. officials showed diplomats and U.N. officials
satellite photos that they said proved that Iraq was circumventing the
sanctions by converting as many as 1,000 heavy-duty imported trucks to
artillery and missile carriers. The photos indicate that Iraq cannot be
trusted to comply with U.N. weapons-control demands even if it lets
inspectors back in, U.S. officials contend.</TE>
<TE>   In an 11-nation tour of the Middle East that starts next week, Vice
President Dick Cheney is expected to seek support for eventual military
action against Iraq. On Wednesday, Iraq's deputy prime minister was
quoted as telling visitors from Lebanon that leader Saddam Hussein was
holding strategy sessions this week in preparation for a possible U.S.
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Some Western diplomats here were skeptical about the Iraqi foreign
minister's intentions. "It's much too early to make a judgment about
whether this is for real--whether they are truly seeing what the route to
full compliance will be, or whether they are just trying to start a
process because having a process gives them more protection than not
having a process," said Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's ambassador to the
U.N.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council has pledged to keep trade sanctions intact until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, as well as any programs to develop such weapons.</TE>
<TE>   If Iraq were to reverse course and readmit the inspectors, Blix's team
would have 60 working days to set up shop in Iraq. Once inspections
resumed, the U.N. team would inform the Security Council whether Iraq was
agreeing to the inspectors' demands for access to dozens of sites and
thousands of pages of documents they say they need to see. If Iraq is
officially deemed cooperative, the Security Council would lift trade
sanctions provisionally 120 days later for renewable 120-day periods.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis' meeting with Annan on Thursday was the first such
encounter since February 2001. At that meeting, Sabri's predecessor,
Mohammed Said Sahaf, infuriated Annan and other officials by refusing to
discuss weapons inspections, instead delivering what one participant
later termed "an endless litany of complaints about all the bad things
the U.S. and the U.K. and the U.N. had done to Iraq." Annan refused
Sahaf's request for a subsequent meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Iraqi diplomats asserted in an address to the Security
Council that Iraq "had implemented all obligations imposed on it by the
relevant Security Council resolutions," including the required return of
Kuwaiti goods and prisoners captured when Iraq invaded in 1990 and the
recognition of Kuwait's "sovereignty and territorial integrity, its
independence and its borders."</TE>
<TE>   But Kuwait contends that scores of its people are still being held in
Iraqi prisons. Western diplomats say that Iraqi television shows the
military using armored personnel carriers and other equipment confiscated
from Kuwait during the occupation. Kuwait asserts that millions of
dollars' worth of stolen Kuwaiti automobiles and industrial equipment
remain in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq appeared Thursday to concede the latter point, at least
partially, agreeing "that a concrete way will be found for Iraq to return
some Kuwait property through the United Nations," Eckhard said.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis also said in June that they would not submit to U.N.
weapons inspections unless the Security Council "took all necessary
measures to destroy the weapons of mass destruction of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   In the meeting with Annan on Thursday, Sabri raised the issue of
Israel's unacknowledged but well-documented nuclear weapons program, the
U.N. obliquely confirmed. The Iraqis proposed "the establishment of a
zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East," Annan's
statement said.</TE>

<LD>A religious panel has recommended that Norway end its 465-year-old
state church system and give all religions equal footing.</LD>
<LD>   After four years of study, a panel from the government-backed
Norwegian Church Council said the time had come to separate the church
and state.</LD>
<LD>   It would take a constitutional amendment to end the system. The
earliest date for the change would be after 2005 national elections.</LD>
<TE>   In recent years, state leaders of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of
Norway and the government have frequently been at odds, especially over
hirings.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the government defied the church's guidelines and allowed the
appointment of an openly gay clergyman in the capital, Oslo.</TE>

<HD>Survival Is Key Concern as Zimbabwe Faces Vote</HD>
<DH>Africa: A food crisis caused by drought and floods has been
worsened by political violence and the nation's land redistribution
program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SELOUS, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>Hunger has become a way of life for the laborers left at the Biri
River Farm.</LD>
<LD>   Maize, a staple for ordinary Zimbabweans, is unavailable or too
expensive. The white farmer, whose land was slated two years ago for
resettlement by landless blacks, also is struggling to make ends meet. He
owes his workers back wages.</LD>
<LD>   Food is on everyone's mind as Zimbabweans prepare to vote Saturday and
Sunday in a presidential election pitting incumbent Robert Mugabe against
former trade union official Morgan Tsvangirai.</LD>
<TE>   But as the candidates battle, many people are going hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "Even bread we don't see these days," said Last Chimutashu, 37, a
longtime farmhand at Biri River Farm, about 50 miles from the capital,
Harare.</TE>
<TE>   Drought and floods have reduced agricultural production throughout
most of southern Africa, significantly slashing the output of maize, the
region's staple crop. In Malawi, religious leaders recently issued a plea
for food aid after reporting that many villagers had resorted to eating
roots and leaves. Mozambique has suffered in the last two years from
flooding that killed more than 800 people and destroyed hundreds of homes
and farms.</TE>
<TE>   In Zambia, a combination of heavy rain and dry spells has reduced crop
production by 24%, according to the Rome-based U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia and Angola also are facing shortages
because of erratic weather.</TE>
<TE>   In Zimbabwe, once known as the region's breadbasket, the problem has
been exacerbated by political violence and the controversial and often
brutal occupation of white-owned commercial farms. Farmers have found it
difficult to cultivate their land, and hundreds of farm laborers have
fled. The country's maize harvest dropped 28% in 2001, according to the
FAO.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a food crisis," said Anna Shotton, a Harare-based officer for
the U.N. World Food Program, which estimates that more than half a
million Zimbabweans face acute food shortages and many others are eating
only one meal a day. "It's very serious. And the situation is
deteriorating."</TE>
<TE>   "We are just struggling," said Richard Arlett-Johnson, owner of the
Biri River Farm. "We are just trying to survive."</TE>
<TE>   When the government slated his farm for resettlement two years ago,
squatters identifying themselves as veterans of the country's
independence war wasted no time moving onto the land--even before it was
officially divvied up.</TE>
<TE>Squatters Have Forced Farm to Cut Production</TE>
<TE>   Production on the 500-acre tobacco and maize farm was disrupted almost
immediately as the new settlers erected makeshift wooden shacks amid the
crops. The decrease in production led to a sharp reduction in profits.
Arlett-Johnson was forced to lay off 38 of his 54 workers. Two others
died of unrelated causes.</TE>
<TE>   Though he has been able to provide jobs and semi-steady wages for 14
farmhands, several of the workers he let go have failed to find work and
have moved back to the farm compound, where they survive on handouts.</TE>
<TE>   Arlett-Johnson has only enough money now to plant fewer than four
acres of corn and 15 acres of beans. Under pressure to feed his workers,
and owing each of them a month's pay of at least $85, he has had to seek
food and financial assistance from local charities.</TE>
<TE>   The scenario is repeated many times around the country, relief
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe has accused white farmers of hoarding food in an attempt to
create an artificial crisis that can then be blamed on his government. He
has promised that "no one will die of hunger."</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai has said the disruptions caused by squatters and the
widespread displacement of farm laborers because of violence and
intimidation have exacerbated the food crisis.</TE>
<TE>   For the last several weeks, supplies to supermarkets have been sparse
and erratic. Long lines wrap around buildings and snake across streets
when maize appears.</TE>
<TE>   "As it is now, you see people sleeping on queues, waiting to get
[maize]," said Gift Muti, a grass-roots coordinator for the General
Agricultural and Plantation Workers' Union of Zimbabwe, a Harare-based
group that helps distribute food aid. "Sometimes they wait for hours,
even overnight."</TE>
<TE>   When maize is available, the price is often out of reach of the rural
poor.</TE>
<TE>   Maize normally provides 60% of the daily energy requirement for an
ordinary Zimbabwean, according to Shotton, the WFP official.</TE>
<TE>   She said many families in rural areas where she was distributing food
were surviving on black tea for breakfast, a mixture of wild fruit and
seeds for lunch, and a stew for dinner made from a type of caterpillar
found in tree trunks.</TE>
<TE>   "There is almost a complete lack of cereal in their diet," Shotton
said. "There is a very sharp reduction in energy level due to the lack of
maize meal."</TE>
<TE>Middle Class Also Facing Food Shortage</TE>
<TE>   Some middle-income families have been able to supplement their diet
with rice or wheat flour, but rice costs 10 times more than maize. Even
they are having to cut back on how much they eat.</TE>
<TE>   Aid workers say war veterans and pro-government militias accuse them
of using food aid as a political tool and have prevented hungry farm
laborers from taking the food.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel that maybe we are feeding the opposition," Muti said. "But
we just want to feed people who have problems. We are not politically
motivated."</TE>
<TE>   Muti said that most local and foreign relief groups had suspended food
distribution until after this weekend's vote because of safety concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Chimutashu, the Biri farmhand, takes care of his wife, mother, three
children and younger brother. He said that he could no longer depend on
his monthly salary and that the squatters would not allow him and other
farm laborers to cultivate their small private plots.</TE>
<TE>   "Now there is no money," he said. "There is no field to grow my maize.
There's nothing."</TE>
<TE>   "It's disgraceful," said the Rev. Tim Neill, an Anglican priest who
runs the Zimbabwe Community Development Trust, a Harare-based crisis and
relief group. "Whole livelihoods have been ruined on a massive scale.
Kids aren't going to school now. They're hungry. It's awful."</TE>
<TE>   Even the squatters have not escaped the wrath of the unfavorable
weather, which has destroyed their meager crops, and few have enough
money to buy fertilizers and farm equipment. Of the 17 squatters who
occupied Arlett-Johnson's farm, only two remain on a permanent basis.</TE>
<TE>   Some foreign aid workers are optimistic that under the right
circumstances, Zimbabwe could overcome this humanitarian catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can control the weather," WFP chief Catherine Bertini said
recently. "What man can control, however, is peace--or at least create
peace. If [Zimbabwe] returns to its earlier stability, it could return to
its earlier productivity."</TE>

<HD>Suharto Son Is Charged in Indonesian Judge's Killing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia
</DL>
<LD>Former President Suharto's flamboyant son, Tommy, was formally
charged Thursday with the murder of a Supreme Court judge in a case seen
as a test of Indonesia's corrupt legal system.</LD>
<LD>   The trial of Hutomo Mandala Putra, better known as Tommy, was expected
to begin in a week to 10 days, court clerk Utol Sidapalok said. State
prosecutors filed the charges in Central Jakarta District Court.</LD>
<LD>   The onetime billionaire playboy is accused of involvement in the
killing in July of a Supreme Court judge who had sentenced him in
September 2000 to 18 months in jail over a multimillion-dollar land scam,
prosecutor Andi Rachman Asbar said.</LD>
<TE>   Tommy also is charged with illegal possession of weapons and fleeing
from justice, Asbar said.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy, the most prominent of Suharto's six children, has denied
masterminding the slaying. The trial of two men charged with the actual
killing is underway.</TE>
<TE>   If found guilty of murder, Tommy could be sentenced to death. He is
being held in a prison in Jakarta, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Critics fear that Tommy has enough money and friends in high places to
bribe his way to freedom in Indonesia's notoriously corrupt legal system.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy went into hiding shortly after the court decision 18 months ago.
He was recaptured in November in a south Jakarta house after a massive
manhunt.</TE>
<TE>   During his disappearance, four men on motorcycles shot and killed
Justice Syaifudin Kartasasmita--the presiding judge in Tommy's graft
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy's father ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for 32 years before
he was forced from office in 1998 amid riots and pro-democracy protests.</TE>

<HD>Hindu Group to Compromise on Temple</HD>
<DH>India: Muslim leaders welcome the move to avert more violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>A militant Hindu group said Thursday that it will accept a
compromise plan in its dispute with Muslims on building a temple on a
site held holy by both sides.</LD>
<LD>   "I am confident that the temple will be built peacefully, without
shedding any blood of either Hindus or Muslims," Ashok Singhal, the
president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council, told
reporters.</LD>
<LD>   Muslim leaders welcomed the remark as a "positive development."</LD>
<TE>   Both statements reversed hard-line positions taken by leaders of both
sides, which threatened to unravel the compromise formula hastily put
forward this week.</TE>
<TE>   It was feared that religious violence could break out if the Hindu
nationalists started building the temple in the northern city of Ayodhya
on March 15 as planned.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu nationalists want to build the temple on the site of a 16th
century mosque destroyed by Hindus in 1992. They say the site was the
birthplace of Rama, an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. The razing of
the mosque sparked sectarian riots that left at least 2,000 dead.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions over the temple plan erupted into violence last week in the
western state of Gujarat, and about 600 people died in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Singhal said the Hindu council has committed to the compromise, under
which the council would symbolically begin construction on March 15 by
bringing the temple's first pillars to an adjacent, government-owned
spot.</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, S.Q.R.
Illyas, said the council's latest statement "will certainly make a
difference."</TE>

<HD>Ireland Keeps Abortion Status Quo</HD>
<DH>Europe: Plan to tighten restrictions is voted down by a slim
margin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DUBLIN, Ireland
</DL>
<LD>By a razor-thin margin, voters rejected a government plan to
tighten Ireland's tough abortion laws, official returns showed
Thursday--a victory for those pushing for greater abortion rights.</LD>
<LD>   The result from Wednesday's referendum left in legal limbo a
decade-old Supreme Court judgment that sought to legalize abortions for
women whose pregnancies threatened their lives, including from suicide.</LD>
<LD>   The defeated amendment would have overturned this landmark 1992
ruling, which created the first exception to Ireland's constitutional ban
on abortion, the toughest such law in the European Union.</LD>
<TE>   The vote was a defeat for the Roman Catholic Church. Catholic bishops,
who each had issued letters calling for churchgoers to vote "yes," made
no comment on the result.</TE>
<TE>   Jubilant "no" campaigners said the amendment's rejection--by 10,556
votes out of more than 1.2 million cast--meant that the next Irish
government would be obliged to pass legislation allowing pregnant,
suicidal women to receive abortions in Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said his amendment had been "an honest and
genuine attempt" to resolve the constitution's abortion ban with the
Supreme Court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   He vowed to press ahead with plans to form a Crisis Pregnancy Agency,
which would aim to counsel many of the approximately 7,000 Irish women
who travel to England each year for abortions.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome reflected a profound divide in attitudes between rural and
urban Ireland, particularly between the increasingly outward-looking
capital and the rest of the country.</TE>
<TE>   All 10 Dublin constituencies had strong "no" majorities, including
Ahern's central Dublin district, where three-fifths of voters rejected
his plans. But elsewhere, most constituencies had solid "yes" majorities,
led by the far northwestern county of Donegal, which habitually records
the strongest vote on traditional morality issues.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts said Ahern's referendum probably was lost because
of a split within the ranks of Ireland's many anti-abortion groups.</TE>

<HD>War Wounded Treated in Germany</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Canadian reporter is in critical condition at U.S.
military hospital. Nine American troops are stable and will be sent home
soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTIAN RETZLAFF</AU>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LANDSTUHL, Germany
</DL>
<LD>Nine American special operations troops and a Canadian journalist
wounded in confrontations in Afghanistan were flown to the U.S. military
hospital here for treatment, doctors said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The service members, evacuated from the tense Operation Anaconda
theater in eastern Afghanistan, were in stable condition, but reporter
Kathleen Kenna of the Toronto Star suffered critical injuries and
remained unconscious after surgery on extensive thigh wounds, Air Force
surgeon Maj. Mark D. Ervin said.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the secrecy imposed on their mission, none of the
troops--seven from the Army and two from the Navy--could be identified.
No details of the circumstances in which they were injured were released,
and they weren't allowed to meet with reporters.</LD>
<TE>   "The injuries were all weapon injuries. They were all injured from
bullets or fragmentary devices," Ervin told a news conference after the
patients, who arrived late Wednesday from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey,
were examined. "In this group of patients there were no significant
central injuries to the chest or to the abdomen."</TE>
<TE>   Ervin said no surgery was considered necessary for the nine, most of
whom will be transported to the United States within a few days.</TE>
<TE>   "They are all doing well. Their spirits are very good. All were able
to speak with their families," said Lt. Melanie Sparks, an Army nurse.
"They are all looking forward to going home, but at the same time, having
to leave their units is something they are dealing with."</TE>
<TE>   As many as 40 U.S. troops have been wounded in the fierce clashes near
Gardez as U.S.-led forces try to defeat hundreds of Taliban and Al Qaeda
holdouts.</TE>
<TE>   More of the wounded are being brought to the Landstuhl hospital for
treatment, officials here said.</TE>
<TE>   Kenna, 48, was traveling away from the battle zone when an
unidentified Afghan threw a grenade into the car in which she, her
husband-translator, a Toronto Star photographer and a driver were
traveling.</TE>
<TE>   Kenna's husband, Iranian-born U.S. citizen Hadi Dadashian, told
journalists about the attack, which occurred Monday afternoon as they
were driving to Gardez from the front-line village of Zormat. They had
been headed for the battle zone when Afghan fighters, presumably employed
by coalition forces to secure the area, told them to turn back, Dadashian
said.</TE>
<TE>   They had been traveling for about 20 minutes when Dadashian noticed an
Afghan man approaching his side of the car with something in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw this Afghan throwing something like a rock against my window,"
Dadashian recounted. He said no one realized it was a grenade until his
wife said she had been hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, some five minutes later, there was this car passing by,"
which was carrying a medic from the aid group Doctors Without Borders, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kenna was later flown to Bagram air base north of Kabul, the Afghan
capital, where she underwent surgery, and was sent on to Incirlik, where
she was treated and evacuated with the wounded troops.</TE>
<TE>   The helicopter lift from Gardez to Bagram flew directly over the area
of Operation Anaconda, Dadashian said. "We were flying right over the war
zone with the back door open and two soldiers with night-vision
[headgear] pointing out with their guns."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors at Landstuhl have told Dadashian that they expect Kenna to
recover. He described his wife as "a good fighter" likely to bounce back
despite the severity of her injuries and ordeal.</TE>

<HD>To Many, Taliban Commander a Home-Grown Hero</HD>
<DH>War: Mullah Saifur Rahman Mansour, a veteran of past Afghan
conflicts, may be attracting local residents to help fight U.S. troops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>As bombs rained down and American forces seized a strategic
ridgeline from a nest of Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts in eastern
Afghanistan on Thursday, details emerged about the veteran Taliban
commander U.S. troops may be facing.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than being an Arab import, Mullah Saifur Rahman Mansour is a
lanky home-grown radical from Paktia province, where the battle is
raging, officials and former comrades in the provincial capital of Gardez
said.</LD>
<LD>   That he is a native of the region, a commander respected both for his
religious purity and sacrifices in past Afghan wars, may help explain the
persistent reports that some Paktia residents have been rallying to his
aid, even under withering fire from U.S. helicopters and gunships and
deadly B-52 bombings.</LD>
<TE>   It also helps illuminate how Rahman and his hard-line followers
managed to remain relatively undisturbed in the mountains around here for
nearly three months after the collapse of Taliban authority in most of
the rest of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some people who say: 'Saifur Rahman is a nice person. Why
must we fight him?' " admitted Abdul Mutin, commander of one of Gardez's
U.S.-allied military brigades, who sits in the same office Rahman once
used.</TE>
<TE>   During Taliban rule, Rahman, who is thought to be about 40, was a
commander on the northern front against the forces of the Northern
Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   His father, a mullah active in politics, was the governor of Paktia
province and made his son a commander of one of the city's three
brigades. Later, his father was killed by a warlord. The young commander
embraced the Taliban cause in the mid-1990s, a time when the
fundamentalist movement was promising to put an end to the chaos caused
by feuding warlords who were destroying and pillaging the country.</TE>
<TE>   Safi Ullah, a spokesman for the local council, or shura, of Gardez,
said Thursday that Rahman was wounded three times in three wars--against
the Soviets in the 1980s, in the fighting among warlords of the early
1990s, and on behalf of the Taliban--and has a maimed hand as a result.</TE>
<TE>   "He is famous in his native place, among his people, but now people
don't really like him because he has stood against the interim
government," Safi Ullah said. "The shura of Gardez asked him in the first
days after the fall of the Taliban to surrender and not to gather people
around him against the government. But he did it anyway."</TE>
<TE>   According to Safi Ullah, Rahman initially pretended when he withdrew
to the mountainous Shahi Kot district that there were no Al Qaeda members
with him, only Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   The shura urged him to lay down his weapons and accept an amnesty like
many other Taliban commanders had done. But, the council spokesman said,
Rahman continually delayed and refused until it was later revealed that
Arab and Pakistani Al Qaeda members had been accompanying him all along.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, we did not want to negotiate with him any more because he
had deceived the council," Safi Ullah said. "So, no more negotiations as
of two months ago."</TE>
<TE>   Fazlullah, the governor of neighboring Lowgar province, said Rahman
had a distinguished reputation as a moujahedeen. He said he had been
puzzled why Rahman and his followers didn't change sides when other
Taliban commanders were doing so in November and December, and give
support to the new interim government being formed by Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it is because their minds were brainwashed under the . . . rule
of the Taliban. Or maybe the foreign [Al Qaeda] have been forcing the
Afghan Taliban with them to stand against the government," said
Fazlullah, who uses only one name.</TE>
<TE>   A third possibility, he said, is that Rahman considers himself bound
by a personal pledge of honor he gave to the Al Qaeda members to protect
them at all costs.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Gardez indicate that some contacts with Rahman had
occurred as recently as last week, just before the U.S.-led assault on
the mountain redoubts began Saturday. Rahman apparently asked the Gardez
shura to send a delegation to him so that he could prove that he was not
still sheltering foreign Al Qaeda members.</TE>
<TE>   But the council, already convinced that Rahman was indeed with the
"terrorists," refused, Paktia Gov. Taj Mohamad Wardak told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, there remains considerable ambiguity about how much of
the force resisting the Americans is Al Qaeda members and how much of it
is simply local Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   As frigid storm clouds shrouded the high mountain passes of eastern
Afghanistan on Thursday, U.S. military officers said their forces had
attained overwhelming ground and air superiority.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Timothy Brooks, an operations officer at the Soviet-built Bagram
air base that now serves as U.S. headquarters for the operation, said
components from three battalions of American forces--about 1,000
troops--have managed to secure high ground on the eastern ridge
overlooking the Shahi Kot valley.</TE>
<TE>   The severe weather descending on the 10,000-foot-high battleground
will limit the air support that Americans had enjoyed in the first six
days of Operation Anaconda.</TE>
<TE>   But Brooks dismissed the weather's effect on U.S. operations. "If
anything, the weather is an advantage for us," he said. "Our guys are
fit, and we are operating at will up there."</TE>
<TE>   After a costly start in the campaign with the death of eight U.S.
servicemen in the first three days, the Army command in Bagram has become
increasingly confident that the battle has turned in its favor. Brooks
said that in the 14-hour period ending Thursday night, the coalition
forces had had no direct contacts with the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   But Lt. Joe Claburn, 25, an officer in charge of dropping food
supplies to troops deployed along the ridgeline overlooking the Shahi Kot
valley, said his Chinook helicopter was the target of heavy gunfire from
a distant mountainside when it began to lift off after unloading
Thursday. The supply drop was made on a mountain ridge called "The Whale"
that looks down on the valley.</TE>
<TE>   Claburn, a native of Montgomery, Ala., who has been in Afghanistan
since November without seeing combat, said he took it as a welcome sign
that his infantry unit has finally gone to battle.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the best days of my life," he said. "When the Chinook
came over the ridgeline and we saw all the American troops in position,
it was a beautiful sight."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that U.S. officers and troops from the 10th Mountain
and 101st Airborne divisions continue to explore the labyrinth of caves
they have captured so far, looking for intelligence on Al Qaeda and
Taliban activities.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no word however about Rahman. A report on the Afghan
Islamic Press, a Pakistani news agency, quoted him as saying that he
intends to fight to the death.</TE>

<HD>Blast Kills 3 Afghan Fighters</HD>
<DH>Asia: One of the men, all U.S. allies, may have set off a booby
trap at an ammunition depot near Kandahar air base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>An explosion at an ammunition depot near the Kandahar air base
killed three U.S.-allied Afghan fighters Thursday, and the top Canadian
officer here said one of the men may have inadvertently tripped a booby
trap.</LD>
<LD>   The explosion Thursday morning about a mile south of the air base sent
shrapnel and other ordnance flying over the heads of Canadian troops who
had gone out to try to help. Detonations from the weapons depot continued
into the evening and started a large brush fire, Lt. Col. Pat Stogran
said.</LD>
<LD>   Afghan forces said the men were moving a crate at the depot that they
hoped to break down into firewood when they apparently tripped the booby
trap, according to Stogran, commander of the approximately 750 Canadian
troops at the base.</LD>
<TE>   Stogran said the threat of further detonations had prevented Canadian
forces from approaching the facility, a known ammunition site used by
allied Afghan forces.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here expecting these sorts of incidents, and certainly when
we are handling caches of ammunition and such, we are very wary of the
possibility of booby traps," Stogran said. "It being their own cache of
ammunition, they were probably a lot more relaxed about it."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't clear whether the alleged trap might have been laid by the
U.S. allies or their enemies. However, Stogran said coalition forces were
aware that Al Qaeda terrorists remained in the region after Kandahar
fell. The southern city was the power base of the ousted Taliban regime
that welcomed Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "We're quite sure there are Al Qaeda operatives that have stayed
behind in the area," Stogran said, and "there are other groups that are
claiming to want to create hostilities within the interim administration,
so it could be any one of a number of groups."</TE>

<HD>Northeast Warms Up to Play Politics</HD>
<DH>Campaigns: Tight governor races are a welcome respite from the
usual mud season. In Massachusetts, Jane Swift may face Mitt Romney.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Mitt Romney has not even announced whether he will run for governor
of Massachusetts this fall. But the prospect of having this handsome,
rich businessman--fresh from a high visibility stint as head of the
Winter Olympics--on the ballot has spiced up an already zesty race, one
of half a dozen hot gubernatorial contests in New England this year.</LD>
<LD>   Party conventions have yet to take place, and primaries will span from
June to September. But, led by Massachusetts, the political horse races
provide a welcome antidote to a time of year known none-too-lovingly as
the mud season.</LD>
<LD>   "In New England, there's not a heck of a lot else to do in the
spring," said Christian Potholm, a professor of government at Maine's
Bowdoin College. "Politics is an indoor sport."</LD>
<TE>   Five Massachusetts Democrats are determined to take back a coveted
corner office on Beacon Hill that passed into GOP hands three governors
ago. Acting Gov. Jane Swift intends to keep the GOP in power by removing
the "acting" from her title. Until a few days ago, she was proceeding on
the assumption that she would have no opposition from her own party.</TE>
<TE>   But Swift, who inherited the job last year when Republican Paul
Cellucci became ambassador to Canada, has seen her approval ratings
fluctuate wildly in recent polls. An initial burst of fund-raising for
Swift has slowed to a trickle.</TE>
<TE>Many in Party Upset With Acting Governor</TE>
<TE>   And just as Republicans thought Swift had overcome the sting of
missteps early in her term, publicity over a hefty retirement package she
recently tried to arrange for her former chief of staff offended many
within the party.</TE>
<TE>   Then in swept the scuttlebutt that the head of the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee was thinking of moving home to
Massachusetts--moving, as a matter of fact, to the very same corner real
estate overlooking Boston Common that Swift now occupies.</TE>
<TE>   Conveniently, Romney held on to another piece of land here when he
took over at the Salt Lake committee: the house in Belmont, west of
Boston, where he and his wife, Ann, raised six children.</TE>
<TE>   In a poll of 406 registered voters taken by the Boston Herald last
week, Romney crushed Swift--and any one of the five Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The wealthy venture capitalist--widely regarded as the white knight
who reversed early scandals and engineered the seamless Winter
Olympics--earned a 57% favorability rating among voters against just 27%
for Swift.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points, showed that
a mere 8% of voters view Romney unfavorably. In the same poll, Swift's
negative rating was 53%.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to rumors that top Republicans were maneuvering to dump
her, Swift declared at a statehouse news conference late last week that
"I guess I should be accustomed to powerful men trying to tell me that
they know better than I do what it is that I should be doing."</TE>
<TE>   Beacon Hill Democrats and Republicans alike retaliated with
stage-whispered humor that the "secret powerful men's club" would meet
daily.</TE>
<TE>   Swift soon backed off, calling her comment an offhand remark.</TE>
<TE>Romney Still Weighing Run for Governor</TE>
<TE>   A Salt Lake Organizing Committee spokeswoman, Caroline Shaw, said over
the weekend that, while Romney was flattered by the high poll numbers,
"he's still reviewing the political landscape and focused on hosting the
Paralympics," an international Olympic-style competition for the
disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Many GOP leaders in the Bay State, however, were ecstatic at the mere
mention of the man who in 1994 gave Edward M. Kennedy a serious run for
his money in the U.S. Senate campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as word got out that Romney might consider running, my phone
started ringing off the hook," said Republican strategist Charley
Manning. "I've been getting over 100 calls a day--from Democrats,
Republicans, independents--saying, You tell Mitty, if he's running, I'm
with him."</TE>
<TE>   His bold challenge to a Massachusetts institution like Kennedy gave
Romney wide name recognition, Manning and others say. His father, George
Romney, served three terms as governor of Michigan and contended in 1968
for the Republican presidential nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Mitt Romney's Games triumph--complete with a special honor awarded him
by the International Olympic Committee--enhanced his star power, GOP
leaders contend.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty percent of the TVs in greater Boston were watching the Winter
Olympics on closing night, and there's Mitt, giving a speech to the world
and getting a medal," Manning said. "People here think one of our own
went off and did something great, and now he's coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Even with no word from the erstwhile candidate, the grass-roots buzz
among Massachusetts Republicans sounds suspiciously like a roar. More
than 50 GOP town chairmen have signed on to a "draft Mitt" movement
launched by a splinter group from the tenaciously pro-Swift state party.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not unhealthy to have differences of opinion or support for
different candidates within the grass roots of the party, but the party
leadership needs to be unified behind one candidate--and we are," said
Kerry Murphy Healey, Republican state chair.</TE>
<TE>   Swift, said Healey, "is not looking for an out. She is ready for a
race. She is ready for a fight. And she has said 'no thank you' to those
gentlemen who have suggested she step aside."</TE>
<TE>   But party stalwart Polly Logan, a former national GOP committee
member, said the shift toward Romney is causing consternation. As an area
captain for Swift, Logan is pledged to persuade delegates to support the
acting governor. But Logan worked on Romney's Senate campaign and is
drawn to the charisma of a squeaky clean Mormon entrepreneur in Harvard
packaging.</TE>
<TE>   "He is such a decent person," she said. "During his Senate campaign, I
even got so I drank orange juice in the morning rather than coffee, and
that was quite a sacrifice for me."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Logan said she is in no mood to drop Swift.</TE>
<TE>   "Gosh no," she said. "I think you go home with the one that brought
you."</TE>
<TE>   All the uproar among Republicans in Massachusetts has not drowned out
the clamor among Democrats here. Just to liven things up--and presumably
also to get himself elected--former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich
parachuted into Democratic caucuses here last month to declare himself a
candidate for governor.</TE>
<TE>   Like Romney, Brandeis University professor Reich has never won an
election. But his rogue status, Rhodes Scholar rhetoric and liberal
philosophy immediately gave him a boost over businessman Steve Grossman,
a former Democratic National Committee chairman who also wants a Beacon
Hill address.</TE>
<TE>   To set herself apart from the pack, State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien,
another Democrat, calls herself the "environmental" candidate for
governor. State Senate President Thomas Birmingham and former state Sen.
Warren Tolman are seeking the Democratic nomination as well.</TE>
<TE>   In New Hampshire last month, Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen set off a
near stampede when she announced that she would run for the U.S. Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Three members of Shaheen's party leaped up to say they would seek her
job--fighting a lineup, currently, of four Republicans who want the
office. Not to be outdone--or barely so--Rhode Island has three Democrats
and three Republicans vying for the open seat of outgoing Gov. Lincoln
Almond, a Republican who is barred by term limits from seeking
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Fulfilling a promise to voters--and his wife--that he would quit
politics after two terms, Gov. Angus King of Maine, an independent, will
set off on a yearlong Winnebago tour of the U.S. with his family in
November. Eight candidates--including four Republicans, two independents,
a Democrat and a Green--hope to succeed King.</TE>
<TE>   In yet another open contest, a more refined race is underway in
Vermont, where one Democrat, one Republican and one Progressive are
pursuing the vacancy created by popular, five-term Gov. Howard Dean, a
Democrat who is exploring a presidential run.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing his second term, Republican Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut
has not indicated whether he will run again--but two Democrats are in a
tooth-and-nail battle for their party's nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Massachusetts race remains the most intriguing--in part
because the leading candidate has not so much as declared. That minor
detail has not stopped supporters here from touting Romney not merely as
their possible next governor but as a natural to move from Beacon Hill to
Pennsylvania Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Massachusetts," said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican
congressman who teaches at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government. "People here assume that if you are governor of
Massachusetts, you ought to be president."</TE>

<HD>California Children Living in Poverty Rose by 430,000 in '90s,
Survey Shows</HD>
<DH>Demographics: Study on the well-being of nation's young finds that
state's proportion of kids at risk remains above the U.S. average in five
categories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN GILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The number of California children living in poverty increased by
more than 430,000 over the decade ending in 2000, according to a survey
released Thursday on the well-being of the nation's children.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 1.8 million of the state's children, or about 20%, live below
the poverty level, compared with the 1990 total of about 1.4 million, or
18%, the study said.</LD>
<LD>   Though California actually improved in eight of the 10 areas examined
in the study, the state's proportion of children at risk remained above
the national average in five of those areas.</LD>
<TE>   Nationwide, the booming economy helped to improve overall conditions
for children in the 1990s, but the child poverty rate remained virtually
unchanged and the proportion of children in single-parent families grew
dramatically, according to the study by Kids Count, a project that tracks
the well-being of the nation's children.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1990s produced brighter futures for many of the nation's 72
million children," said William O'Hare, who coordinated the project for
the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a Baltimore-based private charitable
organization. "But sustaining those advances and extending them to the 12
million kids still in poverty will be an enormous challenge, given the
recent economic downturn."</TE>
<TE>   An additional cause for concern, he said, is that states could be
under pressure to cut programs that improved conditions because of budget
shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>Welfare Reform, Immigration Factors</TE>
<TE>   The findings were also affected by other social and demographic shifts
in the 1990s, including the welfare reform movement and an increase in
immigration that has produced a population in which one-fifth of all
children are immigrants or children of foreign-born parents.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the number of children in the United States grew by more
than 8 million, the largest increase since the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The state-by-state analysis allowed the group's researchers to examine
changes more closely than ever before, said Mark Mather, a policy analyst
with the Population Reference Bureau and one of the report's authors.
Breaking the figures down by state helped detail the sometimes vast
differences between states. Child poverty increased by 30% in Alaska, for
example, but decreased by 33% in Colorado and South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Given the shift in power from the federal government to the states in
many policy areas affecting children, these differences were relevant, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   The data came from the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey and provided a
preview of the American Community Survey, an annual census survey of
700,000 households, Mather said. The American Community Survey could give
reliable estimates of social and economic data every year.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's study looked at 10 indicators experts believe have adverse
effects on children's lives. It also offered a "family risk index" based
on families that live below the poverty level, in a single-parent
household, in a home where neither parent is fully employed or in a home
where the head of the household is a high school dropout.</TE>
<TE>California Risk Factors Above Average</TE>
<TE>   On a scale where the No. 1 ranking indicates the lowest risk factor,
California ranked 37th, with 14% of children living in such families.</TE>
<TE>   California had more children living in poverty, living with low-income
working families, living with a parent without a high school diploma or
living with no full-time employed parent than the national average, the
study found.</TE>
<TE>   While California slightly improved its percentage of children living
with a parent without a high school diploma, it had the highest rate
among the states.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hare said he hopes states that didn't improve in certain areas will
take a look at states that did and replicate their programs. The purpose
of the study, he said, is to increase public awareness and public
understanding of problems facing children.</TE>
<TE>   "Decisions made on firm statistical information are better than those
made on anecdotal information, and they lead to a better outcome for
children," he said.</TE>

<LD>Americans are at least 10 times more likely to be murdered on the
day of their birth than at any other point in their lives, according to a
study by federal health officials.</LD>
<LD>   A startling 243, or 7.3%, of the 3,312 infant homicides recorded from
1989 through 1998 occurred on the date of birth, according to data
released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   When based on years of exposure per person, the homicide rate for
infants on the first day of life was about 10 times greater than the next
most vulnerable group, adults ages 20 to 24.</LD>

<LD>About 2.5 million power cord sets sold with Hewlett-Packard inkjet
printers are being recalled because the part that connects to the printer

<LD>   The manufacturer, Longwell Electronics of Brea, Calif., has received
no reports of injuries, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   The gray, two-wire power cord sets with an LS-7C connector were sold

<LD>Whoops! Call the painter back. The color of the universe is not the
turquoise that astronomers said. Instead, it's a rather ordinary beige.</LD>
<LD>   Two Johns Hopkins University astronomers announced in January that
they had averaged all colors from the light of 200,000 galaxies and
concluded that if a human could see this combined hue, it would be a
sprightly pale green. That, they said, was the color of the universe.</LD>
<LD>   But Karl Glazebrook and Ivan Baldry said that conclusion was tripped
up by flawed software.</LD>
<TE>   After correcting an error, "it looks like beige," he said. "I don't
know what else to call it. I would welcome suggestions."</TE>

voters, according to the Zogby International telephone poll of 326

<HD>Man Stuck in Windshield Left to Die</HD>
<DH>Law: A nurse's aide is accused of hitting the homeless victim with
her car and letting him bleed to death in her garage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FORT WORTH
</DL>
<LD>A nurse's aide hit a homeless man with her car, drove home with him
stuck headfirst in her broken windshield and ignored his cries for help
as he bled to death in her garage over the next two or three days, police
say.</LD>
<LD>   Chante Mallard allegedly told police she periodically went into the
garage, apologizing to him but doing nothing to help.</LD>
<LD>   Mallard, 25, was arrested Wednesday and was later charged with murder
and released on bond. She faces from five years to life in prison and a
fine up to $10,000.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm going to have to come up with a new word. 'Indifferent' isn't
enough. 'Cruel' isn't enough to say," Tarrant County prosecutor Richard
Alpert told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. " 'Heartless'? 'Inhumane'?
Maybe we've just redefined inhumanity here."</TE>
<TE>   Police said 37-year-old Gregory Biggs probably would have lived had he
received immediate help. When the man finally died, Mallard and her
friends put the stranger's body in the trunk of another car and dumped it
in a park, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Mallard allegedly told police she had been drinking and using the drug
Ecstasy the night Biggs was hit. The impact hurled him headfirst through
the windshield, leaving his broken legs protruding onto the hood.</TE>
<TE>   With the man lodged in the windshield, the woman panicked and drove a
few miles to her Fort Worth home, parked her car in the garage and
lowered the door as Biggs pleaded for help, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   When Biggs' body was found Oct. 27, evidence pointed to a hit-and-run,
investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. David Burgess said police were contacted a few weeks ago by
someone who said she heard Mallard at a party talking about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Mallard allegedly told a friend details when asked why she was no
longer driving her car.</TE>
<TE>   A search of Mallard's house turned up the damaged car with blood, hair
and other evidence, authorities said. The car's seats were found in the
backyard, and one had been burned.</TE>
<TE>   Mallard's attorney, Mike Heiskell, said: "I think this is overreaching
on the part of the prosecution and the police, and, in the end, I believe
the law will shake out that this was simply a case of failure to stop and
render aid."</TE>
<TE>   The medical examiner's office said Biggs suffered no internal injuries
and apparently died of shock and loss of blood.</TE>
<TE>   Mallard told investigators she went into the garage a few times and
apologized to the victim but never called for help as he pleaded with
her. She wouldn't say why she wouldn't get help, Burgess said.</TE>
<TE>   Charges may be filed against some of Mallard's friends who helped her
take Biggs' body to the park, Burgess said. Police do not yet know
whether anyone besides Mallard knew about the man while he was still
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Medical examiner's records listed Biggs' address as a homeless shelter
in Fort Worth. His mother, Meredith Biggs, said she recently had begun
looking for him.</TE>
<TE>   "How could she just leave him like that to die?" she told the
Star-Telegram. "Drugs and alcohol wear off, so why didn't she get him
some help? I should have prayed more."</TE>

<HD>Bush Reaps Praise From New York's Lawmakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Nearly six months after terrorists attacked New York City,
lawmakers lauded President Bush on Thursday for giving the stricken
metropolis billions of dollars in aid, and momentum grew for Congress
itself to meet there for the first time in more than two centuries.</LD>
<LD>   In effect, it was New York's day in the nation's capital.</LD>
<LD>   On Capitol Hill, the House overwhelmingly approved a bill to extend
jobless benefits that included $5 billion in tax relief to help rebuild
the devastated business district surrounding the former site of the World
Trade Center. Senate approval was expected today.</LD>
<TE>   At the White House, Bush announced he would sign the bill and proposed
additional aid that would bring the federal commitment to New York-area
relief to more than $20 billion, exceeding the promise Bush made in the
days following the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   These developments drew bipartisan cheers from New York's
congressional delegation, including some of the president's sharpest
critics, who gathered with him and city and state officials in the Rose
Garden to mark the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to have a joint session of Congress in New York," Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) told Bush. "And perhaps you'll consider
coming up and speaking to such a joint session about America's commitment
to rebuilding New York and America's commitment to fighting for freedom
that you are leading today."</TE>
<TE>   The president had no immediate reply to the invitation. And plans for
Congress to meet in New York, which have been kicking around since
October, are still preliminary.</TE>
<TE>   But House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) support the idea of taking the national
legislature to the city where the 1st Congress convened in 1789.</TE>
<TE>   Hastert gave the idea a further push Thursday. "There are some
functions that probably are appropriate for the Congress to do in New
York," he told reporters. "We are taking a look at that. We have a lot of
logistics that we need to take a look at."</TE>
<TE>   The speaker said security and cost issues would have to be cleared up
before a decision can be made. But a majority of House members back the
idea. Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) in October introduced a resolution
calling on Congress to meet in New York; it has 242 cosponsors.</TE>
<TE>   The 1st Congress met in the city from March 1789 to August 1790.
Congress then moved to Philadelphia before settling in Washington in
1800.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, according to Senate associate historian Donald A. Ritchie,
Congress has met outside Washington only once. On March 2, 1989, it held
a joint meeting in Philadelphia to mark the bicentennial of the 1st
Congress.</TE>

<HD>Photos Show Jet's Impact Into Pentagon</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A sequence of five government photos shows the moment the hijacked
American Airlines plane slammed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The photos were taken by a surveillance camera positioned north of the
section of the Pentagon destroyed by the impact and the resulting
explosion and fire.</LD>
<LD>   The images cover a span of four one-hundredths of a second. The first
photo shows a small, blurry white object near the upper right

the date and time were added the day after the attack when they may have
been cataloged for investigative purposes.</TE>

<HD>GOP Gets Delay on Court Nominee</HD>
<DH>Judiciary: The Senate panel staves off a rejection of the
Mississippi judge in a party-line vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Facing defeat on a party-line vote, Senate Republicans on Thursday
were granted a week's delay in deciding the fate of embattled Mississippi
trial judge Charles W. Pickering.</LD>
<LD>   An angry Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) accused "extreme left Washington
interest groups" of "lynching" the 64-year-old judge for political gain.</LD>
<LD>   "Make no mistake: These groups have their own political agenda, which
is to paint President Bush's nominees as extremists and block them from
the bench," Hatch said during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at
which Pickering's nomination was to be considered.</LD>
<TE>   Had the committee voted as scheduled, Pickering's nomination to the
U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans appeared headed for a
10-9 defeat. Approval by the committee is needed for the nomination to be
considered by the full Senate.</TE>
<TE>   All 10 Democrats signaled that they oppose Pickering's elevation from
a U.S. district court to the appellate court, while all nine Republicans
said they supported Bush's nominee.</TE>
<TE>   The Republicans are hoping one of the Democrats will switch sides and
support Pickering, or at least vote to send his nomination to the floor.
There, Republican leaders think they can muster a majority.</TE>
<TE>   But the sharp exchanges at Thursday's hearing suggest that the sides
have hardened.</TE>
<TE>   Several Democrats took exception to Hatch's comment about "lynching."
They noted that dozens of President Clinton's nominees were blocked
during the 1990s when Hatch and the Republicans were in the majority.</TE>
<TE>   Current Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) insisted
that the Democrats have not portrayed Pickering as racist or extremist.
Instead, they described him as a bumbler on the bench whose rulings were
often reversed.</TE>
<TE>   They also said Pickering had a disconcerting habit of injecting his
personal and political views into legal decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the nominee's past views and actions during a difficult time
in Mississippi were not irrelevant, but I based my decision on his years
on the bench. It is a record that is replete with examples of bad
judging," Leahy said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the judge often threw out, before a trial, lawsuits
brought by prison inmates and civil rights plaintiffs. In at least 25
cases, the 5th Circuit reversed Pickering's rulings as mistaken, Leahy
said.</TE>
<TE>   The rough, highly politicized dispute over Pickering's nomination is
seen by liberal and conservative activists as the first skirmish in what
could be a political war if a Supreme Court seat becomes vacant.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of civil rights and women's rights groups targeted
Pickering for defeat based on his long record of conservative activism
and his right-leaning decisions as a judge. They include People for the
American Way, the Alliance for Justice, the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People and the National Abortion Rights Action
League.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Pickering say he has been unfairly tarnished because of
Mississippi's history of segregation and racism. In 1967, as a young
lawyer, Pickering testified against a local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Republicans lauded his "moral courage," and they pointed out that many
black Mississippians have stood up for Pickering.</TE>
<TE>   He also earned a "well-qualified" rating from the American Bar Assn.
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the furor over the nomination, it is not clear that the
outcome has much significance to the judiciary.</TE>
<TE>   The conservative-leaning 5th Circuit has nine Republican appointees
and five Democratic appointees. If Pickering is confirmed, he would add
one more vote to the conservative side. If he is not, he will continue to
serve as a U.S. district judge for southern Mississippi.</TE>

<HD>El Nino, Asleep the Last 4 Years, Is Stirring, Weather Experts Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Weather anomaly El Nino, blamed for searing droughts and
devastating floods worldwide, is awakening from a four-year slumber,
government weather experts said Thursday, but how hard it will hit is
unknown.</LD>
<LD>   Last seen in 1997-98, El Nino caused deadly droughts in Australia, the
Philippines and Indonesia, and floods in Peru and Ecuador.</LD>
<LD>   El Nino, which means "little boy" or the Christ child in Spanish, is
an abnormal warming of waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean that usually
occurs every four to five years and can last up to 18 months. First
reported by Latin American fishermen, the weather phenomenon was usually
seen around Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   "It's still too early to determine the potential strength of this El
Nino . . . but it is likely these warming conditions in the tropical
Pacific will continue until early 2003," Conrad Lautenbacher,
administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   In January, NOAA predicted for the first time that an El Nino would
likely occur this spring.</TE>
<TE>   NOAA said it issued the forecast after seeing strengthening in a
nascent warming trend in ocean surface temperatures off South America
last month.</TE>

<HD>ID Fraud Costing $1 Billion a Year, Report Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Reports of identity theft have grown rapidly over the last several
years, and the resulting credit card fraud has surpassed $1 billion
annually, congressional investigators said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Complaints to consumer hotlines, the Federal Trade Commission and
other sources show that Americans more than ever are at risk of having
their money stolen and credit records wrecked.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems we all know someone who's had his identity stolen," said
Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). "This crime is getting more common all
the time."</LD>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, said it is
difficult to find out exactly how many people have fallen victim.</TE>
<TE>   "Some individuals do not even know that they have been victimized
until months after the fact, and some known victims may choose not to
report to the police, credit bureaus or established hotlines," the report
says.</TE>
<TE>   From 1998 to the middle of last year, the Social Security
Administration reported a fivefold increase in allegations of Social
Security number fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Credit card companies Visa and MasterCard reported that fraud losses
rose from about $700 million in 1996 to $1 billion in 2000. Federal and
private hotlines reported a steep increase in complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of these various sources or measures seems to indicate that the
prevalence of identity theft is growing," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Using a Social Security number and easy-to-obtain personal information
such as a name and address, it is fairly simple for a criminal to open a
loan or credit card account in another person's name.</TE>
<TE>   Identity theft is an old crime that has become much more common with
widespread Internet use.</TE>
<TE>   Companies hold huge databases of personal information, and there are
few laws that restrict the sale of that information from company to
company. In Internet chat rooms, credit and calling card numbers are
traded like currency.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) wants to require consent before a
company can sell a person's information. Her bill would make it a crime
to sell or display Social Security numbers to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Due partly to the growth of the Internet and other communications
technologies, there is general consensus that the opportunities for
identity theft are not likely to decline," the investigators wrote.</TE>

<HD>Bush Rejects Increased Exec Liability</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Unveiling a list of reforms, the president says
shifting legal costs to officers could invite more suits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush rejected calls to hold corporate executives more
personally liable in investor lawsuits, fearing that such a step might
spur a rash of litigation, administration officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In formally announcing a set of reforms designed to protect investors
from the kinds of abuses seen in the Enron Corp. collapse, Bush said
corporate officers must be held to a higher standard.</LD>
<LD>   Bush proposed that executives who mislead investors or sign off on
inaccurate financial statements be required to return bonuses or be
barred from serving at public companies.</LD>
<TE>   "The people who run public companies owe a special obligation to these
investors, many of whom have put their savings and future security on the
line," the president said. "Reform should start at the top. The chief
executive officer has a daily duty to oversee the entire enterprise."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush declined to endorse a proposal advocated by his own Treasury
secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, that would have made it harder for corporate
executives to rely on company-paid insurance policies to pay the legal
costs of defending them in cases brought by investors or others claiming
that the company misled them.</TE>
<TE>   The president feared that such a requirement might encourage investors
to sue corporate officers, administration officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important to provide sound regulation and remedies where
needed, without inviting a rush of new lawsuits that exploit new problems
instead of solving them," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>Plan Falls Short, Democrats Say</TE>
<TE>   Bush also decided that such a proposal was unnecessary because
insurers already have the power to refuse to cover legal costs incurred
by corporate officers and directors in the event of fraud or willful
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats immediately blasted the president's plan as inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul O'Neill was much more aggressive in his recommendations about
what ought to be done," said Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the Senate
majority leader.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no penalty for corporate fraud in the president's proposals.
So I think that it falls short of what would have to be the minimum
standards," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, who is part of the president's high-level working group that
is drafting post-Enron reforms, had proposed making it more difficult for
executives to use corporate insurance to cover the legal costs of dealing
with claims of negligence or misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The working group may still include such a provision in its own
recommendations, which have not yet been released.</TE>
<TE>   Bush unveiled a 10-point plan Thursday to protect shareholders,
improve corporate disclosure and tighten oversight of auditors.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would bar corporate executives from profiting from their
mistakes or lack of oversight by giving the Securities and Exchange
Commission the power to demand that bonuses and other performance-based
compensation be returned if financial statements are found to be
misleading.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make sure that when there are material restatements of
earnings that can be traced to management or CEO errors, CEOs should not
be allowed to profit from those transactions," a senior administration
official said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Such a rule might have forced Enron executives to return millions of
dollars they collected through bonuses and stock options. But the
administration official stressed that the investors should not expect a
guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   "Businessmen can make boo-boos," the official said. "When you invest
in a company in which a businessman makes a mistake, a business judgment
mistake, no one wants to have anyone be guaranteed for those returns. And
we're trying to be very careful to steer away from that issue and still
leave investors on the hook for the choices businessmen make about
business."</TE>
<TE>'Toothless' but Politically Prudent</TE>
<TE>   Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University, said the
president's plan is not as ambitious as other proposals but may represent
a good compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks pretty toothless, but it may be the best that you can come
up with from a political standpoint," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   He called O'Neill's proposal to make executives more personally liable
for legal bills impractical.</TE>
<TE>   "If you did that, the best people won't become CEOs," Smith said. "You
won't be able to hire anybody who's good."</TE>
<TE>   He said such a government rule also would infringe on the free-market
rights of companies and insurers to decide the terms of their policies.</TE>

<HD>'Partial-Birth' Abortion Ban Is OKd in Virginia</HD>
<DH>Law: The state is the first to outlaw the procedure since such
limits were struck down by the high court. Gov. Warner is expected to
sign it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Virginia lawmakers approved a bill Thursday that would revive a ban
on the procedure opponents call "partial-birth" abortion and make the
state the first to outlaw such abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court
struck down bans adopted by 31 states.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would make it illegal for doctors to perform "medically
induced infanticide." A doctor who violates the ban could face up to 10
years in prison and a fine of up to $100,000.</LD>
<LD>   The measure would allow an exception to protect a pregnant woman's
life or to prevent "substantial or irreversible impairment of a major
bodily function." Virginia's first prohibition of such abortions, passed
in 1998, included no health exception for the woman.</LD>
<TE>   The measure passed the state Senate on Thursday, 26 to 12. It passed
the House last month, 75 to 25, and now goes to Gov. Mark Warner, who has
said he would sign a ban on midterm abortions as long as it would
withstand legal scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Qualls, the governor's spokeswoman, said Warner is reviewing the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's passage represents the clearest victory of the legislative
session for abortion opponents. The Senate defeated a bill passed by the
more conservative House that would have required girls to receive a
parent's written consent for an abortion. The senators also rejected a
House-backed bill that would have introduced a charge of killing or
harming a fetus into criminal law.</TE>
<TE>   The abortion measure passed Thursday would punish anyone who
"deliberately and intentionally performs either the delivery of a living
fetus or a substantial portion thereof . . . for the purpose of
performing a subprocedure intended to kill the fetus."</TE>
<TE>   The type of abortion the bill would ban is most common in the second
trimester of pregnancy. About 90% of abortions take place in the first
trimester. Advocates and opponents of the bill say the procedure it bans
is rarely used.</TE>
<TE>   Bans of the procedure have been a flash point in the political debate
over abortion since the Supreme Court gave states some latitude a decade
ago to restrict it.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Virginia's abortion opponents have won passage of laws
creating a mandatory waiting period for women seeking abortions and
requiring minors to notify their parents before having abortions, though
they do not need parental consent.</TE>

<LD>A group of national and state health organizations filed suit
Thursday in a last-ditch effort to stop federal officials from cutting
Medicaid reimbursement rates later this month.</LD>
<LD>   The rate reduction is scheduled to be phased in starting March 19 and
would close a regulatory loophole that allows many states to bill the
federal government at 150% of the Medicaid payment rate.</LD>
<LD>   The groups suing, led by the American Hospital Assn., allege the
Department of Health and Human Services made "an arbitrary and capricious
decision that will cause irreparable harm to the nation's public
hospitals and the patients they serve."</LD>
<TE>   They are asking the U.S. District Court in Little Rock, Ark., to issue
an injunction preventing HHS from implementing the rule change on the
grounds that the agency failed to follow proper procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Scully, administrator for HHS' Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
Services (CMS), dismissed those charges Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Ending this practice is clearly the right policy decision for
American taxpayers," Scully said. "We are confident that we met all the
requirements to make sure that this regulation would be effective in time
to begin saving federal dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Nickels, a senior vice president for the hospital association,
called the lawsuit a "last resort."</TE>
<TE>   "We talked to CMS, HHS and the administration to no avail," Nickels
said, adding that they hope for a ruling before the March 19
implementation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to leading national health organizations, the lawsuit is
backed by hospitals and hospital organizations in California, Florida,
Georgia, Arkansas and New York. The suit was filed in Arkansas because
hospitals there would be particularly hard hit by the move, Nickels said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has made ending "creative financing" of
Medicaid by the states a priority. Administration officials estimate the
move to reduce Medicaid reimbursement rates to be in line with Medicare
payment rates will save $9 billion over the next five years. They and
others have cited past abuses of the so-called upper payment
limit--including states using such funds for road projects and other
non-health-care needs--as justification for ending the practice entirely.</TE>
<TE>   But critics argue that the $9 billion in savings amount to a
significant reduction in the Medicaid program and will severely limit the
ability of already cash-strapped public hospitals to serve the poor and
uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   California and Los Angeles County officials have warned that the state
will be significantly harmed by the move, despite being given eight years
to wean itself of the additional money now used to bolster "safety net"
hospitals. The California Healthcare Assn., which joined the lawsuit,
said that over the next seven years the state will lose "at least" $1
billion if the rule goes into effect.</TE>
<TE>   "California has never abused the program; all of the money has gone
directly back to health care," said California Healthcare Assn.
spokeswoman Jan Emerson. "We have followed the rules all along, and we're
using the money to benefit the people who are at greatest risk. The
bottom line is real people will be hurt by this."</TE>
<TE>   Emerson and others backing the suit question why the administration
wants to end a program that was reworked in the Clinton administration to
eliminate abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Nickels said Thursday that Scully's statements about abuse within the
program "would have been relevant a year ago, but not now."</TE>
<TE>   Scully, however, said the practice "effectively resulted in states
obtaining excessive federal Medicaid payments without putting up the
state share required by law or assuring that the additional money was
being used for Medicaid-related expenses."</TE>

<HD>Officer Facing Louima Case Trial Is Free on Bail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>After nearly three years behind bars, a white former police officer
whose conviction in the torture of Abner Louima was thrown out on appeal
was freed on $1-million bail Thursday to await a new trial.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Reena Raggi agreed to release 36-year-old Charles
Schwarz but restricted him to New York City. The bail was secured with
his mother's house.</LD>
<LD>   "Today's a great day. I've been waiting for this day for 33 months," a
smiling Schwarz said as he left the courthouse to applause from
supporters and jeers from a smattering of protesters.</LD>
<TE>   His retrial in one of the city's most notorious police brutality cases
is set for June.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Alan Vinegrad tried to have Schwarz placed under house
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz was one of four white officers sentenced to prison in
connection with the attack on Louima, a Haitian immigrant who was
sodomized with a broken broomstick in a Brooklyn police station bathroom
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz was accused of holding down Louima while Officer Justin Volpe
brutalized him.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz denied being in the bathroom. But after Volpe pleaded guilty,
a jury convicted Schwarz in 1999 of violating Louima's civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   The attack heightened tensions between the Police Department and the
black community and led to street protests.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, however, a federal appeals court ordered a new trial for
Schwarz, ruling that his lawyer had a conflict of interest and that the
jury was tainted because it had found out about Volpe's secret plea.</TE>
<TE>   Louima, who suffered severe internal injuries, criticized the appeals
court decision Thursday in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "I had hoped, after all these years, I would be able to go on with my
life," Louima said. "Unfortunately, that is not the case."</TE>
<TE>   Louima--who received an $8.7-million settlement from the city and
police union--pledged to "fully cooperate" with prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "I thank my family, my friends and, of course, God for giving me the
strength to fight for justice as long as it may take," Louima said.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court last week also threw out the obstruction-of-justice
convictions of Schwarz and two other officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas
Wiese, who were accused of covering up the crime. Bruder and Wiese cannot
be retried on the charges.</TE>

<HD>Defense Rests for Ex-Black Activist Tried in Slaying of Atlanta
Deputy</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>The defense in the murder trial of the former black-power radical
once known as H. Rap Brown rested its case Thursday without calling him
to the stand.</LD>
<LD>   Closing arguments were scheduled for today.</LD>
<LD>   Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, now a 58-year-old Muslim cleric, is charged
with killing one sheriff's deputy and wounding another in a shootout in
Atlanta last March. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   The defense contends Al-Amin is a victim of mistaken identity and a
target of a government vendetta connected to his activism during the
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   The final defense witness testified that someone else opened fire the
night the deputies were shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not him," said Imhotep Shaka, a retail shop owner and disc
jockey who lives near the West End neighborhood shooting site. Shaka said
he saw the shooting from his bedroom window but did not immediately call
police because he feared harassment.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, two defense witnesses testified they saw a large white
van backing down the street after they heard gunshots, contradicting the
wounded deputy, who said Al-Amin drove away in a black automobile.</TE>

<HD>Bush Firing of Key Army Aide Assailed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>House lawmakers said Thursday their former colleague was fired as
civilian head of the Army Corps of Engineers because of his honesty in
predicting Congress would not allow the administration's proposed cuts in
water project spending.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Parker was just telling the truth, said Rep. Gene Taylor
(D-Miss.), namely that the Bush administration "purposely low-balled the
budget" knowing that Congress, a staunch supporter of Army Corps
projects, would restore the money.</LD>
<LD>   Parker, an assistant Army secretary, was fired Wednesday. A week
earlier, he told the Senate Budget Committee that proposed cuts could
hurt the corps' efforts and that he expected the final budget approved by
Congress would be higher.</LD>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer defended Parker's dismissal. The
president thinks "it's appropriate for staff to support the
administration's policy," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   White House budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., in a memo written
two days after Parker's Senate testimony, said Parker, Army Corps chief
of engineers Lt. Gen. Robert Flowers and Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) had "reached convivial agreement" that the
budget was "unacceptable and probably just a cynical ploy."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's plan for fiscal 2003 cuts the corps' budget by 10% to
$4.175 billion, excluding federal retirees' pensions and benefits. The
corps had requested more than $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The plan includes a 16% reduction in the construction budget, causing
the termination of at least 64 contracts that employ 8,600 people, a
House Transportation Committee analysis showed. It would cost $190
million to eliminate these projects, the committee said.</TE>

<HD>2 Counts Dropped Against Ex-Priest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>A judge dismissed two child rape charges against the former Roman
Catholic priest at the center of the Boston Archdiocese sex scandal
Thursday, saying prosecutors had not filed them in time.</LD>
<LD>   The defrocked priest, John Geoghan, had argued the 1999 indictment
alleging he twice raped a young boy between 1980 and 1984 came after the
statute of limitations had expired.</LD>
<LD>   Suffolk County Judge Margaret Hinkle agreed. County prosecutors said
they had made no decision whether to appeal.</LD>
<TE>   The boy in the latest case, now a 27-year-old mechanic with two sons,
said he had not heard of the judge's decision and had no immediate
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan is serving a 9- to 10-year sentence for fondling a 10-year-old
boy at a pool and faces a third criminal trial for abuse of a child as
well as 80 civil lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese is at the center of a growing sex abuse scandal that
broke wide open after reports that church officials ignored warnings
about Geoghan's pedophilia. Cardinal Bernard F. Law publicly apologized
to Geoghan's victims and announced a revamped "zero tolerance" policy.</TE>
<TE>   In the last several weeks, the archdiocese has given prosecutors the
names of 80 priests accused of abuse over the last 50 years and suspended
10 active priests.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments:</TE>
<TE>   * St. Louis Archbishop Justin Rigali said a computer belonging to a
priest in suburban Florissant has been seized as part of a child
pornography investigation. Father John Hess has left his parish. Two
other priests in the archdiocese have been removed in the last week amid
allegations of child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   * A spokesman for the Pittsburgh diocese said Bishop Donald Wuerl has
recently removed several priests from the ministry because of accusations
of child sexual abuse. The spokesman, Father Ronald Lengwin, wouldn't say
how many priests had been removed.</TE>

<HD>EPA Chief's Remarks Stir Dispute at Senate Hearing</HD>
<DH>Environment: A former agency official says the Bush administration
is trying to weaken clean air regulations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>EPA Administrator Christie Whitman suggested Thursday that power
plants sued for pollution violations might want to delay settling their
cases until an appeals court rules on a federal utility's challenge to
her agency's orders.</LD>
<LD>   That type of advice, said Eric Schaeffer, the Environmental Protection
Agency's former director of civil enforcement, is why he resigned last
week, protesting what he said was a White House determination to weaken
clean air regulations.</LD>
<LD>   Their dispute occurred during a confrontational Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee hearing into the Bush administration's environmental
record.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals is considering a lawsuit filed
in 2000 by the Tennessee Valley Authority challenging EPA orders
toughening air pollution control requirements on older coal-fired power
plants.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were a plaintiff's attorney, I wouldn't settle anything until I
knew what happened to that case," Whitman testified. "We should be
getting a decision sometime in April, and that will, I think, determine
whether other companies come to the table."</TE>
<TE>   The EPA had said that the TVA violated the Clean Air Act for 20 years
by making improvements at seven of its 11 coal-fired plants in Tennessee,
Alabama and Kentucky without installing state-of-the-art pollution
control equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The authority said it has spent more than $2.5 billion to reduce
pollutants from its plants, including a voluntary plan to spend more than
$600 million on emission reductions.</TE>
<TE>   It said meeting EPA's order would require spending billions of dollars
more and force its electric rates higher. It argues that the Clean Air
Act exempts older plants from the state-of-the-art pollution requirements
imposed in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer told the committee after listening to Whitman testify that
her comments would "send a clear signal" to utilities that they can
afford to buck federal regulators trying to enforce the Clean Air Act at
aging power plants.</TE>
<TE>   EPA efforts to compel pollution cleanups are "threatened by a
political attack on the enforcement process that I have never seen in 12
years at the agency," he said, pointing to energy lobbyists working with
the White House and the Energy Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Not surprisingly, defendants have slipped away from the negotiating
table one by one, and our momentum toward settling these cases has
effectively stopped," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said Whitman had not
meant to offer legal advice.</TE>
<TE>   "Her point was simply that that was another example of the ebb and
flow of legal cases that makes it difficult to predict outcomes," he
said. "Does that mean we aren't going to pursue the TVA case? No, it
doesn't. Of course we are."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998, the EPA has interpreted the law known as "new source
review" as requiring old coal-burning power plants to install expensive
new pollution controls to meet air quality standards when they upgrade
facilities to produce more electricity. The utilities that have been sued
have contended that work on their plants is more in the nature of
maintenance than an upgrading.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing his energy policy in May, however, President Bush
directed the EPA and principal Cabinet members to consider rescinding the
requirements after the plants' owners complained they were too costly.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration is not following a balanced environmental policy,"
said the committee's chairman, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.).</TE>
<TE>   Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) defended Bush as "trying to bring
common sense and reasonableness to the debate."</TE>
<TE>   The White House distributed a 24-page statement on its environmental
record at Thursday's hearing.</TE>

<HD>Camera Lets Hubble Look Back in Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Spacewalking astronauts widened the Hubble Space Telescope's eyes
to the universe Thursday by installing an advanced optical camera.</LD>
<LD>   James Newman and Michael Massimino made room for the $76-million
Advanced Camera for Surveys by pulling out the last of the 12-year-old
Hubble's original scientific instruments.</LD>
<LD>   The new camera will allow Hubble to peer deeper into space, all the
way back to some of the early phases of the universe more than 12 billion
years ago, when galaxies began to form.</LD>
<TE>   "You guys just paved the way for a lot of Ph.D.s in the years to
come," said astronaut Richard Linnehan, who monitored the 7 1/2-hour
spacewalk from inside space shuttle Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth--and longest--spacewalk in as many days for
Columbia's crew. One final excursion was planned for today; astronauts
will attempt to repair an infrared camera that has not worked for three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Newman slid the new camera into Hubble on guide rails as Massimino
called out the clearances for the 875-pound device, about the size of a
phone booth but considerably more fragile. Within minutes, the camera was
all the way in and latched down tight.</TE>
<TE>   It passed its initial tests. Flight controllers in Maryland will spend
the next month or two fine-tuning the instrument. Astronomers hope to
begin using it by early May.</TE>
<TE>   The instrument, which took five years to develop and build, is three
cameras in one. It is expected to provide twice the field of view, twice
the clarity and five times the sensitivity of Hubble's current workhorse,
the 8-year-old Wide Field and Planetary Camera.</TE>
<TE>   "The advanced camera is going to add 10 times the capability to
Hubble," said UC astronomer Garth Illingworth, the camera's deputy chief
scientist. "So here we have a telescope that is incredibly faster, ready
to move for the future."</TE>
<TE>   He described this week's power improvements to Hubble as a tuneup on
"a hot automobile." On Thursday, he said, the astronauts put in the
turbocharger.</TE>
<TE>   "Hubble will detect more faint stars and galaxies during its first 18
months than have been detected with all of the previous Hubble
instruments," said Johns Hopkins University astronomer Holland Ford, who
led the team that built the camera. Ford said the camera may be able to
capture images of planets orbiting other nearby stars.</TE>
<TE>   The camera was inserted into the slot that belonged to the Faint
Object Camera, which was original equipment on Hubble in 1990 but
eventually became obsolete with its 1970s technology. It was taken out of
service a few years ago.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>A computer specialist was charged Thursday with operating a sex
show Web site on a high-speed line that he got the Army to pay for by
telling them it was used for communicating with forces in Bosnia.</LD>
<LD>   A 68-count indictment charged Gilbert Benjamin, 49, of Neptune, N.J.,
with mail and wire fraud and submitting false claims with the intention
of defrauding the government, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael Guadagno.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment said Benjamin charged the Army more than $100,000 to
run the Internet line from 1997 to 1998, telling officials at Ft.
Monmouth, N.J., that it was needed to back up the post's communications
with forces in Bosnia.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Benjamin used the line to operate an adult entertainment Web
site whose paid subscribers could participate in two-way video hookups
with live shows, Guadagno said.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin also ordered computers and computer parts that he sold to an
electronics company owned by his brother, Guadagno said.</TE>

<HD>Suits Can Target Drug Makers</HD>
<DH>Courts: Eli Lilly, Squibb remain defendants in wrongful death cases
involving tampering with medications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.
</DL>
<LD>A judge refused Thursday to drop two pharmaceutical giants from
scores of wrongful-death lawsuits stemming from the case of a pharmacist
who watered down chemotherapy drugs given to cancer patients.</LD>
<LD>   Eli Lilly and Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. argued that they were
not liable for Robert Courtney's tampering with the drugs Gemzar and
Taxol, made by Lilly and Squibb, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   But Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Lee E. Wells told a courtroom
filled with Courtney's alleged victims and their relatives: "I disagree
with the argument that Lilly and/or Bristol had no duty to take any act
with the misuse of the drug after they knew what was going on."</LD>
<TE>   Courtney, 49, pleaded guilty last week to 20 counts of tampering with
and adulterating or misbranding drugs. He could get up to 30 years in
prison, and most of his $10 million in assets will be used for
restitution.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Lilly planned to appeal the decision, spokeswoman Judy
Kay Moore said it was an option.</TE>
<TE>   She also said the company was confident it did nothing wrong. Contrary
to the plaintiffs' claim that a sales representative was aware of
possible dilutions in early 2000, Moore said the company did not suspect
any wrongdoing until May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after that meeting, the FBI began its probe of Courtney.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that it is absurd to hold the pharmaceutical companies
responsible for Robert Courtney's acts and that we acted both legally and
ethically in this case," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly attorney Marie Woodbury had argued that, under the law, even if
Lilly knew what Courtney was doing, it had no duty to stop him. She also
said there is no evidence that Lilly knew about Courtney's actions.</TE>
<TE>   She and Squibb attorney James Conlon also argued that the
pharmaceutical companies were not liable for the mishandling that took
place after the drugs left the companies' hands.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ketchmark, an attorney for patients in 173 of the lawsuits,
said the companies had a duty to warn patients.</TE>
<TE>   He said the companies should have known about Courtney's actions
because they track what happens to the drugs from factory to the
consumer.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only didn't they call people or tell people, they kept giving him
the instrument of the crime," Ketchmark said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits also name the druggist and his business as defendants.</TE>

<HD>Man Who Received Self-Contained Artificial Heart Is Back in
Hospital</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>A 51-year-old man who is one of six to receive a self-contained
artificial heart has returned to the hospital after three weeks of living
in a hotel suite, doctors said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   James Quinn of Philadelphia is one of only two recipients still living
with the AbioCor device humming inside his chest. He was released from
the hospital Jan. 14 and had stayed at a nearby hotel with his wife.</LD>
<LD>   But Dr. Louis Samuels said Quinn was readmitted to Hahnemann
University Hospital on Feb. 3 with breathing difficulties. He was treated
for pneumonia and spent about 10 days on a ventilator.</LD>
<TE>   "It is clear that Mr. Quinn has significant emphysema and pulmonary
hypertension, which put him at risk for respiratory complications," said
Samuels, director of the transplant team that performed the operation
late last year.</TE>
<TE>   All of the AbioCor patients were dying of heart failure and were too
sick to qualify for human heart transplants. The plastic-and-titanium
device has an internal battery and controller that are implanted with the
heart.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Christerson, 70, is the longest-living recipient of the device.
Christerson, of Central City, Ky., has been steadily recovering at a
hospital since he received the device Sept. 13.</TE>

<HD>Assisted Suicide Measures Gain</HD>
<DH>Politics: Hawaii House approves two 'death with dignity' bills. The
governor pushes Senate to schedule a vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU
</DL>
<LD>The Hawaii House approved two bills Thursday to allow competent,
terminally ill adults to seek a doctor's assistance in ending their
lives.</LD>
<LD>   Approval came after nearly two hours of emotional, sometimes personal,
floor debate on the legal, moral and ethical implications of
doctor-assisted suicide.</LD>
<LD>   "Even though I may have personal misgivings, I don't believe it is my
right to tell the people of the state of Hawaii that you cannot use your
freewill to decide whether you want to end your life at all when the
moment comes," said Rep. Joe Souki, a Democrat. "It is your choice to
make and it is not mine."</LD>
<TE>   The Senate has not taken up the issue. Senate Health Committee
Chairman David Matsuura has said he will not hold hearings on any
House-approved measures, a move that would end any chance of the bills
becoming law. However, Gov. Ben Cayetano supports the so-called death
with dignity measures and has publicly asked Matsuura to clear the way
for a possible vote in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   If the laws are approved, Hawaii would join Oregon as the only states
to allow doctor-assisted suicide.</TE>
<TE>   One bill approves a constitutional amendment allowing assisted
suicide. The other details how the law would be implemented, specifying
that terminally ill, competent adults would be able to obtain
prescription medication for the sole purpose of taking a lethal dose. The
measure prohibits mercy killings, lethal injections or active euthanasia.</TE>
<TE>   The two bills both passed, 30 to 20, with one member absent.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was enough to send the constitutional amendment to the Senate
for further action.</TE>

<HD>Father Guilty in Girl's Snake Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREENSBURG, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>A man whose 8-year-old daughter was squeezed to death by the
family's 11-foot python was found not guilty Thursday of involuntary
manslaughter but guilty of endangering the girl's welfare.</LD>
<LD>   Robert D. Mountain, 31, was negligent but not grossly reckless in
leaving Amber Mountain home alone with the snake last August, Judge
Richard McCormick Jr. ruled in the nonjury trial.</LD>
<LD>   Mountain could get up to five years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Amber was found unconscious on the kitchen floor with the python,
named Moe, coiled around her body. She died two days later at hospital
from compression of the head and neck.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Wayne Gongaware had argued that what the girl's father did
was "worse than leaving a child alone with a loaded gun. A gun cannot
slither down the stairs toward a vulnerable child."</TE>
<TE>   But the judge said prosecutors failed to prove the snake had not been
released from its cage by Mountain's estranged wife or by his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's mother--who bought the snake--pleaded guilty to child
endangerment in December and was placed on probation for two years. Marcy
Mountain, who is estranged from Mountain, testified against him.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Mountain testified that he was kept awake by the python the
night before his daughter was attacked as the snake tried to escape from
its makeshift cage.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain said he applied about four layers of duct tape to hold a
screen on the lid in place and checked on the snake before leaving for
work the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   Both he and his wife said they knew the snake had outgrown its cage, a
particleboard bin bought from a fabric store, with a hinged,
clear-plastic lid that Robert Mountain had attached.</TE>
