<HD>Having Another Round of Cocktails With Andy</HD>

<LD>The floating Andy Warhol party moved to Beverly Hills on Thursday
night, where bright, scrawling images covered the otherwise blank
walls of the overcrowded Gagosian Gallery. Few guests seemed to
notice the art. There was hardly room to move, let alone scrutinize
the paintings, and the place was filled with a thousand conversations
and the scent of white wine.</LD>
<LD>   "You like the paintings?" one man asked his companion. "What I can
see of them," came the answer. A few feet away someone asked: "Do you
know that Warhol allows us to see the room through a child's eyes?"</LD>
<LD>   It was the opening of "Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat:
Collaboration," an exhibition featuring about a dozen works that mix
Basquiat's Neo-Expressionism with corporate logos from Warhol. (The
works were panned by critics when they first appeared, but today all
things Andy are au courant.) The two-hour cocktail party drew legions
of art-conscious Hollywood types.</LD>
<TE>   Winona Ryder sneaked in quietly with a male friend, prompting some
guests to whisper: "Is that her boyfriend?"</TE>
<TE>   Later, Kirsten Dunst arrived and dutifully posed for a
photographer. K.d. lang was there trying to keep a low profile. A
woman walked in carrying a Spider-Man doll.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy draws them in," said Timothy Hunt, the New York art agent
who helped orchestrate the show. "For quite a lot of people, he's
bumped Picasso and Matisse as the most important artist of the 20th
century."</TE>
<TE>   After the show, everyone met at Morton's for the party's
after-party. Tables had been cleared to make room for the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   On one wall, clips from Warhol's avant-garde films rolled: a woman
dressed and undressed. A nude couple engaged in an endless kiss.
Factory muse Nico, awash in pink, gazed over the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   At a booth near the bar, Dennis Hopper and Victoria Duffy enjoyed
the scene. Irving Blum and Eli Broad were nearby. Lang pulled a
photographer toward her and said: "Hey, get this picture!" A camera
flashed as lang, veteran singer Marianne Faithfull and Roy Orbison's
widow, Barbara, stood together and smiled. Later, Faithfull stood on
a small stage in the center of the room. "Here we all are,
celebrating a moment," she said. "It feels kind of weird."</TE>
<TE>   As Andy Garcia went to fetch Dustin Hoffman a drink at Deep on
Thursday night, he inadvertently sprinkled his drink on a woman
standing nearby. "Did you feel that?" said Alison Schmidt, a costume
designer, to her friend Jessica Kender. "Andy Garcia just spilled his
drink on my fishnet stockings." "Woo hoo," 26-year-old Kender
replied, as she waved her arms in the air. "This is how close we're
going to get to fame."</TE>
<TE>   Both Garcia and Hoffman were at the club on the corner of
Hollywood and Vine for the "Confidence" wrap party, thrown by
Movieline magazine. (The heist movie is to open in December.)</TE>
<TE>   At the club, where performers in skimpy underwear danced inside
glass boxes above the bar, the movie's stars and crew reminisced
about the making of the movie, as outtakes were shown on a screen and
waiters offered comfort in the form of warm chocolate-chip cookies.</TE>
<TE>   Director James Foley was feeling part nostalgia, part relief. "You
put your heart in it," he said, "but when it ends, it's really sad."
Nearby, producer Marc Butan recalled good times at Deep--part of the
movie is set at the club. "It was such a love fest," he said. After
the amour, however, "you get your life back."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Burns came after 10 p.m., announcing big plans for the
remainder of the evening. "I'll be dancing in the booth later," he
joked. To the disappointment of several in the crowd, he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "All those people reacting to God, doing things for God. But isn't
the whole concept of God that God would need no help? He can handle
it all, right? How can you say you believe in God and then try to
help God at the same time? It doesn't make any sense."</TE>

<LD>THE WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO RABBITS</LD>
<LD>   Stories</LD>
<LD>   By Emma Donoghue</LD>
<TE>   Harcourt</TE>
<TE>   256 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   It's often said that fact is stranger than fiction. Emma Donoghue,
an Irish writer who specializes in spinning intriguing tales from
bits of historical facts, has staked her career on that premise. Her
novel of last year, "Slammerkin," set in working-class London of the
1700s, was inspired by a long-forgotten murder involving a young
woman whose lust for a shiny red ribbon led to a life of
prostitution. The facts on which that book was based, however, almost
pale against the quirky lore fueling her newest release.</TE>
<TE>   "The Woman Who Gave Birth to Rabbits" is a series of historically
based short stories focused on bizarre happenings to which Donoghue
brings her intellectual curiosity and sharp writing, creating a
hybrid of history, folklore and literature.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Last Rabbit," for example, we're given what can only be
described as stranger than strange. Mary Toft of Surrey, England, in
the early 1700s managed to convince a medley of doctors that she'd
given birth to dead rabbits. Unlike midwives of that age, doctors did
not oversee childbirth and generally had scant understanding of the
female reproductive system. According to Donoghue's fictional
perspective, Toft created the hoax as a response to poverty,
confident she'd be paid by both the men of science and the curious to
learn more about her tale.</TE>
<TE>   The story is a bit gruesome in its details of staged "miracle"
rabbit births, but Donoghue does a commanding job creating, if not a
historically accurate figure of Toft, a convincing fictional
portrait. "I tried to remember if childbirth itself was as bad as
this mockery of it," Toft wonders after performing her trick for yet
another doctor. "With my last boy I was three days in labour, but at
least I knew there was a real child to bring forth, not like this
hollowness, this straining over nothing."</TE>
<TE>   "Night Vision" tells the childhood story of Frances Brown, the
"Blind Poetess of Donegal," and her desire to attend school. Donoghue
demonstrates here and throughout the collection her ability to create
arresting portraits of moments through sense details. Franny, the
blind narrator, explains how she encounters her world. "I think
colour is when you can taste something with your eyes," she
speculates. Her siblings, though, are unable to function in darkness.
"They depend on the light so much that once the candle is snuffed
out, the greasy air seems to extinguish them too."</TE>
<TE>   Donoghue's narratives weave the best of Irish oral storytelling
with the concrete of history, creating in these bizarre tales a look
into lives less than typical. There's "A Short Story," based on "The
Smallest of All Persons Mentioned in the Records of Littleness," and
"Acts of Union," about a man tricked into marriage under the effect
of alcohol. (Donoghue also provides a concise after-note to each
story explaining which aspects are factual and where she came across
the source material.)</TE>
<TE>   "Looking for Petronilla," one of the book's strongest entries, is
narrated by the witch Dame Alice, who's been living since the 12th
century and has grown weary of existence. "The daily miracle, the
return to the same healthy flesh. How long must it go on?" she
laments. Though jaded with life, Alice has never attempted suicide.
"I am afraid to discover that it would not work." The story is an
absorbing juxtaposition of current and past as Dame Alice returns to
Kilkenny in the present day on her first trip back to Ireland since
fleeing in 1324. She's come to remember her loyal servant,
Petronilla, who was burned at the stake for her blind allegiance to
Alice. "History always becomes a cartoon, where it survives at all,"
Dame Alice thinks upon seeing her own legend exploited. "Your best
hope for a ride towards posterity is the bandwagon of folklore."</TE>
<TE>   The idea that folk tales and works of the imagination impress us
with history in ways facts cannot drives Donoghue's strongest stories
and is solidified by her ability to write authentic characters. In
her capable hands, they transcend their freak-show attributes to
become credible individuals at the crossroads of time.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the stories succeed. Some fail from lack of imagination,
degenerating into polemical outbursts. "The Fox on the Line," for
example, shows the complex relationship of two women working for
animal rights, but ultimately the story is overshadowed by the
politics at the heart of their activities. "Revelations," the story
of a 40-day, end-of-the-world fast is much too transparent in its
disdain of religious conviction. Donoghue's reproach of fanaticism in
this story eclipses the authenticity of her characters.</TE>
<TE>   As a collection, though, the strong outweigh the weak, cementing
the notion that the lies of fiction are often more authentic than
hard facts. Or, as one of Donoghue's characters puts it, lies "last
longer than the truth, as fruit is better preserved in wine than
water."</TE>

<HD>Bunco's Hands Are Clean Now</HD>
<DH>Chatting, not cheating, marks the card game at suburban
gatherings</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The evening started off calmly enough. Eleven women gathered in the
kitchen of Melanie Ballard's La Canada Flintridge home, discussing
their children's schools, church, lipstick colors, while nibbling on
Chinese takeout and homemade cookies. But within moments of sitting
down, Ballard, 49, a music teacher and mother of six, leaped to her
feet, jumped up and down like a high school cheerleader and squealed,
"Bunco, bunco, bunco!"</LD>
<LD>   Such is the way of bunco, a game of chance with roots in the
California Gold Rush, Prohibition and "bunco squads." The game, which
seems to have successfully shaken its shady past, is enjoying a
resurgence, especially among suburban moms for whom it provides a
much-needed night off.</LD>
<LD>   There are "thousands and thousands of women playing in Southern
California alone," said Leslie Crouch, who operates the World Bunco
Assn. (www.world bunco.com) out of her Carlsbad home, and several
hundred thousand in the U.S. "And it's just growing." In 1996, when
Crouch started the association, most bunco activity was concentrated
in Arizona, Texas and California. "Now it's very popular on the East
Coast as well," she said.</LD>
<TE>   "We have people contacting us from all over the country as well as
outside the country," offered Crouch. "A lot of military wives play
bunco. There are even several celebrities who play," she added,
singling out actress Andie MacDowell.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really about the game," said Charlotte Saydah, 45, a
member of the 2-year-old La Canada Flintridge group. "It's about an
excuse to get together. It's easy enough that you can play and talk
at the same time and have a glass of wine. You don't have to
concentrate real hard."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, just around the corner in the dining room, at the winner's
table, there was an animated discussion about the merits of a Target
store knockoff charm bracelet versus the real thing, followed by a
"Sex and the City" debate ("That's a bad show." "No, that's a funny
show") all while the dice were rolling. When one team trounced the
other, however, the women resorted to making adolescent L and W hand
gestures (for "loser" and "winner") at one another.</TE>
<TE>   It's a long way from the game's beginnings. Bunco, sometimes
spelled "bunko," dates to the mid-1800s. During the Gold Rush, the
story goes, a crooked gambler made his way through San Francisco,
introducing the game to many an unlucky opponent. Consequently, the
term "bunco" came to mean any kind of swindle. By the turn of the
century, the game had gone straight, becoming primarily a female and
family diversion. But during Prohibition, it became tainted once
again, as gamblers took it up in secret bunco parlors.</TE>
<TE>   The game is generally played with 12 participants, nine dice and
one bell, which is used to signal the end of one round and the
beginning of the next. Although different bunco groups have their own
variations, most follow the same basic rules. There is a winners'
table, a losers' table and an in-between table. Four players, paired
off randomly, sit at each table, and each table has three dice. One
player rolls at a time.</TE>
<TE>   The game begins with ones. The object is to roll three ones, which
is exactly what Ballard did on her first roll. This is a bunco. Next
come twos, threes on up to sixes. Then a new round begins, with
winners moving up a table or remaining at the winners' table, losers
moving down or remaining at the losers' table, and each woman getting
a new partner. Some groups play for money, some for prizes. Members
of the La Canada Flintridge group, who get together once a month,
contribute $20 apiece to the kitty each time they meet.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it does get really crazy," said Cindy Porcell, 39,
during a break in the game. "There's a mysterious purse we play
for--money or a gift. That's where it gets really wild." On this
night, the mysterious purse was tucked inside a small cardboard
Winnie-the-Pooh box that changed hands at least a dozen times over
the course of the evening, each time someone got a bunco.</TE>
<TE>   Porcell claimed the purse a couple of times, and each time, the
mother of 13-year-old twins, who otherwise seemed the model of
propriety, did a spirited dance that had the rest of the group in
hysterics. At one point, she put the box under her sweater. Another
woman sat on it like a protective hen. Never mind the fact they had
no idea what the box contained. It could have been a booby prize. (In
fact, it turned out to be a $30 Gap gift card, which Porcell's sister
Patti Maloof won, having rolled the last bunco of the evening.)</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Leggett of Newport Beach plays in two bunco groups, both of
which meet once a month. "One of the things that sets bunco apart,"
said Leggett, who is in her 40s, "is you can feel competitive about
it. But it's not a game of skill or strategy. It's pretty mindless.
Like some games you get so involved and you really get let down in
yourself if you don't do your best. With bunco, you can't get upset.
There are no worries about how you're performing. It takes that whole
element away. It becomes more of a social situation."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Leggett resists the idea that the time spent playing is
mindless. "I don't like the idea of bunco being chatty, frivolous,
silly women. I look at it as learning about each other. There's a lot
of wisdom from the grandmas, or someone like me who's had their kids
in school. There's a lot of energy I get from someone who's younger.
There's a lot we can offer each other."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, before bunco went bonkers, Crouch and a partner created a
boxed version of the game called It's Bunco Time!!! After her partner
left the business, Crouch licensed the game to Talicor Inc., a
Chino-based company. Though bunco could easily be played with
standard dice, plain paper and any old bell or noisemaker, there's a
market for It's Bunco Time!!!, which is packaged in a shiny black
cube with a handle and generally retails for around $20. The La
Canada Flintridge group, for example, uses it.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go into someone's home and they're entertaining friends,
they like to have something nicer than some scratch paper and a
shoebox full of dice," said Lew Herndon, Talicor's chairman of the
board. Herndon added that sales of the game doubled last year. This
year, they expect to sell more than 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the perfect therapy," said Ballard, who ended the evening
with $40 for having an even number of wins and losses. Debbie Cox,
37, of Pasadena had a slightly more circumspect view of the whole
thing. "It's really sad when you think about it," said the sales
manager for Campbell's Soup, "that this is the highlight of my day."</TE>

<HD>He Shushes New Parents' Cry for Help</HD>
<DH>Pediatrician's study of other cultures yields tips he says
can conquer even the worst colic</DH>

<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your beautiful new baby is healthy and home. Everything feels
perfect. Until the crying starts. You hold him. You caress him. You
check for a wet diaper; is it time for dinner? Everything seems on
track, but the crying does not cease.</LD>
<LD>   All babies cry, you tell yourself as you cradle your little one in
your arms. Maybe you take a walk. You try rocking him. But the baby's
cries continue. Is it gas? Is it something more serious? Am I a
terrible mother? A clueless father?</LD>
<LD>   The longer you pace the floor with your newborn, the louder the
wails become. Desperate minutes turn into hours. Soon that sweet baby
you've eagerly awaited all these months begins to pluck your very
last nerve. You put her down, thinking you won't be manipulated. You
will not succumb.</LD>
<TE>   And the baby screams bloody murder.</TE>
<TE>   There are experts, books and Web sites galore to learn everything
there is to know about pregnancy, natural childbirth and
breast-feeding, but does anyone really know what to do with a colicky
baby? Does anyone even understand that sustained, inconsolable crying
known as colic?</TE>
<TE>   For years, doctors have debated the causes of colic, with the
prevailing theory being that it is gastrointestinal in nature.
Pediatricians often recommend that the breast-feeding mother cut back
on "gassy" vegetables and spicy foods in response. Others in the
medical field attribute colic to overstimulation of the baby's
immature nervous system, recommending "white noise" to calm the baby.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such an instinct to want to calm your baby, but it's not
instinctive to know how," says Harvey Karp, a Santa Monica
pediatrician and author of "The Happiest Baby on the Block," released
today by Bantam Books, which details five techniques for calming
colicky babies that Karp has taught his patients for many years.</TE>
<TE>   "Babies don't have a broad vocabulary. They cry the same way if
they need to burp, have a wet diaper or are hungry. But when you hear
the crying, it makes your skin jump. You feel there is something
really terrible going on with the baby."</TE>
<TE>   If anyone knows crying babies, it's Karp, a pediatrician for 25
years and a professor of pediatrics at UCLA School of Medicine whose
patients include the children of Michelle Pfeiffer and Madonna. In
1981, Karp received an Ehrmann Fellowship to study crying and colic.
The more time he spent studying other cultures, the more he wondered
why mothers in other countries did not complain about overly fussy
babies. What did they know? What were they doing differently?</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that was very common around the world was the
swaddling, the wrapping of the baby," Karp says. "Babies don't need
freedom. They need protection and security. Inside the uterus, they
can't move their arms, so it makes sense to wrap them. The Russians
even put a belt around the blanket to make sure it stays in place.
People from other cultures are not all that impressed with my
findings."</TE>
<TE>   The way Karp sees it, there is too much crying going on in the
United States, and he believes his book and companion video are the
kernels of a parenting movement that can stop it. Every year, 4
million babies are born in the United States; 1 million of them spend
at least two or three hours a day crying, Karp says.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a lot of crying going on in this country, and that's not
even counting the mothers," he says. "Parents get exhausted, couples
get into problems, women get depressed and babies get abused, and are
even killed, because people don't know these techniques, which are
really just a return to ancient wisdom we discarded accidentally in
our rush to scientific advances."Karp's explanation for colic is
simple, if a little startling: Babies are born three months too soon.</TE>
<TE>   When Karp announces this at a recent seminar for the staff of St.
Anne's, a residential facility in downtown Los Angeles for adolescent
pregnant girls and mothers, the women gasp and roll their eyes. Is
the good doctor suggesting women stay pregnant three months longer,
as if they really had a choice in the matter?</TE>
<TE>   "Of course not," Karp laughs. "Nobody would dream of that, but it
gets you thinking from the baby's perspective. Babies are not ready
for the world when they are born. For the first three months, they're
really like fetuses. They're more like they were inside of the womb,
but they're born because they have big brains and they need to come
out."</TE>
<TE>   The transition to the outside world can be very abrupt, and for
some babies the adjustment is tougher than for others. For nine
months, babies snuggled in a warm, tight, wet womb where there was
constant movement and noise. According to Karp's research, the sound
of a mother's blood flowing through her body is louder than two or
three times the noise a vacuum cleaner makes.</TE>
<TE>   "So what's it like when the baby is born?" Karp asks. "It's too
quiet, too still and too boring. Parents worry about overstimulation,
but a bigger problem is understimulation. Babies want hypnotic,
repetitive and rhythmic noise and movement that is jiggly. Calming a
baby is like dancing with your baby, but your baby is leading.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry about spoiling them," he says. "You kick them out of
the uterus because their heads are too big, and now you want to put
them in the crib and have them just lay there and be quiet? That's
not fair. This is a real cutback in attention and stimulation from
the baby's point of view."</TE>
<TE>   Babies, like adults, have reflexes. Most important, Karp says,
they have a calming reflex--"nature's shut-off switch"--that parents
can learn to trigger in "the fourth trimester," as Karp calls the
baby's first three months of life. Karp's prescription for a quiet
baby rests in what he calls "the 5 S's"--swaddling, side/stomach
position, shhhing, swinging and sucking--techniques and traditions he
learned from his studies of ancient and modern cultures.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know the cause of why babies are colicky. But these are
methods he's tried with his patients and have worked, and he puts it
all together in the book in a simple and systematic matter," says Dr.
Morris Green, who heads the behavioral and developmental pediatrics
division at Indiana University's School of Medicine and has read the
book.</TE>
<TE>   To calm a fussy baby, Karp says, wrap him tightly in a square
blanket, pinning the baby's arms against his sides so he can't break
loose. This simply sets the stage for the calming efforts to come, so
don't be alarmed if your baby initially cries harder at being
swaddled. Next, position him in your arms on his side or stomach;
make a shhhh sound loudly in his ear to imitate the sounds he heard
in the uterus; swing the baby; and, finally, give him something to
suck on.</TE>
<TE>   Although some infants will respond quickly to two or three of the
steps, the most colicky newborns will require all five, Karp says.
For those infants, each stage is a layer that builds on previous
ones. "If you do these things, and you do them correctly, it will be
like a miracle," Karp says.</TE>
<TE>   But don't take it from him--or the footage in his video of
red-faced screaming infants who quiet down in less than a minute with
the doctor's touch. Take it from those in the trenches.</TE>
<TE>   Baby Emerson Thein, born on April 10, cried at least eight or nine
hours a day for the first five weeks of her life. She slept only 10
hours a day, and her parents were beside themselves. How bad did it
get? Dhari and Daniel Thein took a decibel reading of their baby's
wails: it was a whopping 95, louder than a chainsaw. Dhari Thein
called everyone she knew, but no one, including her pediatrician,
could help. Books offered no solutions. Then a lactation nurse
suggested Karp.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband would come home from work, and I'd be crying more than
she was," says Dhari Thein, 34. "You love this little being so much,
and she looks to be in so much anguish and pain, and you can't do
anything to soothe her. It's so frustrating. When Dr. Karp came here,
she'd been screaming for two hours. I was going to feed her, but he
asked me to give him a chance. Truthfully, I thought this man had met
his match. I didn't think his techniques were going to work on my
incredibly cranky baby. In about a minute, she was quiet and
peaceful. I was amazed and surprised and I wanted to learn it. I
thought he slipped something to my baby."</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Emerson was sleeping 14 hours a day, and she
responds to the "5 S's" as if she came up with them herself, says her
more rested mother. "She's much happier and more playful and so are
we. Before, my husband and I had this hot potato thing going on, 'No,
you take her!'"</TE>
<TE>   Joy Chudacoff, of Marina del Rey, knows Dhari Thein's pain well.
Her 18-month-old son, Jack, cried 12 hours a day during his first
three months. Karp taught the first-time mother his "cuddle cure,"
and baby Jack developed a charming personality.</TE>
<TE>   "He developed colic in the hospital, and nobody there knew what to
do," says Chudacoff, who is five months pregnant. "There was no help
for us. When Dr. Karp showed us his technique, my baby started
resting comfortably. Now, with my second child, I have no concerns.
Those five steps really do work, and I think they're most effective
when they're done together like he suggests."</TE>
<TE>   Debi Halpert-Storosh of Mar Vista is such a fan of what some
parents call the "Harvey shuffle" that she teaches it to any pregnant
woman who will listen. Her children, Victoria, 13, and Matthew, 10,
were colicky babies who calmed down when she learned the "5 S's."</TE>
<TE>   "I've told everyone I know, because it works," she says. "I even
stop people in baby stores to tell them. The first three months of
being a parent are harder than heck."</TE>
<TE>   Karp, who has no children of his own, claims he hasn't yet met a
howling infant he could not console.</TE>
<TE>   "If I said that about knee reflexes, nobody would think anything,
and it wouldn't sound like bragging," he says. "But if you think
about these techniques, it's kind of what you want to do for the baby
naturally. It's just learning to do them right and in the right
order. It takes practice. It's a skill. And when you get it right,
you're unstoppable."</TE>

<LD>The Science of Solving Crime</LD>
<LD>   Police use clues to solve crimes. Sometimes clues are unusual. Lip
prints might fall into this category. Lip prints are unique and do
not change over a person's lifetime. If found at a crime scene, they
can provide important clues and are collected as evidence. Lip prints
can be left on cups, bowls, drinking glasses and even envelopes.</LD>
<LD>   This activity shows how they can help identify a person.</LD>
<TE>   Materials: Dark lipstick; white paper; pencil or pen.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Apply lipstick to your lips and rub them together.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Fold a piece of paper in half and place the paper (fold
toward you) against your lips. Press your lips onto the piece of
paper hard. Be careful not to smudge your print!</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Remove the paper from your lips. Unfold it and write your
name below your prints.</TE>
<TE>   The study of lip prints is called "cheiloscopy." This comes from
the Greek word, cheilos, meaning "lip." Lip prints are classified
into eight patterns. Five are shown here. Look at your paper and see
if yours are similar to any of these. Have fun finding out!</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about clues and methods used to solve crimes at
"Whodunit? The Science of Solving Crime" at Discovery Science Center
from June 8 through Sept. 8. For more information, call (714)

<HD>Home Economics Gone Mad</HD>
<DH>Real estate agents face a market with a dearth of houses
and a glut of desperate prospective buyers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kayla White realized her new job was going to be slightly different
than she had imagined when the clients she had driven to an open
house refused to get out of the car. "There was a line, like, out the
door," she said. "And this couple said they just couldn't handle it,
that they didn't want to get involved in a bidding war. I could not
think of a nice way to tell them, 'Well, there's no way you're going
to get a house then.'"</LD>
<LD>   Just yards away from Pasadena's Norton Simon Museum and right
across the street from the local Jaguar and Rolls-Royce dealerships,
the Coldwell Banker Previews office is not, perhaps, the embodiment
of the term "in the trenches." And yet, even as it sits placidly amid
the noise and haste of Colorado Boulevard, within its walls roils an
industry gone mad.</LD>
<LD>   'I Had No Idea How</LD>
<TE>   Crazy It Was Going to Be'</TE>
<TE>   The real estate agents here cover the San Gabriel Valley,
including Pasadena, South Pasadena, Arcadia, Altadena, San Marino, La
Canada. Many of these towns, particularly the ones with good schools,
have been high-end for years. But lately, low interest rates, lack of
inventory and an influx of Westsiders priced out of their
neighborhoods have lifted some of the areas from high-end to prime.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea how crazy it was going to be," said White, who
joined the office in March. "I walked into this one Craftsman on a
pretty nice street. There was a 2-by-4 holding up the ceiling, and I
almost fell through the floor on the way to the kitchen. It sold in
less than a week, and I heard through the grapevine it went for over
list [price]."</TE>
<TE>   For agents new and seasoned, such a boom means many things--higher
commissions, yes, but also more work and, to a certain extent, a new
job description. Far from the stereotype of the ambitious
ex-homemaker (think Annette Bening in "American Beauty"), an
L.A.-area real estate agent is now often one part captain of
industry, one part battalion commander and one part therapist. In
this Coldwell Banker office, as, no doubt, in hundreds of realty
offices in the area, multimillion-dollar deals are struck while
five-figure-commission dreams are shattered, and someone has to fill
out the forms and hand out the tissues.</TE>
<TE>   Every agent has a briefcase full of stories like White's. Stories
about the open house where 150 groups showed up in the first two
hours, of the tear-down probate that went for twice its appraised
worth. Of buyers willing to make an offer 20% over the list price
just so they won't "lose" another house. Even of the buyer who added
annual passes to Disneyland to his bid to make his offer stand out.</TE>
<TE>   "We had one seller settle on one offer out of nine because of a
dog," said Pat Rowan, the office training director. Many agents, she
explained, have long had their buyers write a brief letter
introducing themselves to the sellers. Now these little notes have
gained the clout, and anxiety level, of a college entrance essay.</TE>
<TE>   "The buyer wrote about how great this house would be for them
because it was a single level and they had this old dog who couldn't
get upstairs any more," she said. "The sellers were dog lovers.
Whatever works."</TE>
<TE>   Seller's Market Can Be</TE>
<TE>   Frustrating, Exhausting</TE>
<TE>   The stories are outrageous and exciting, fun to hear and clearly
fun to tell, but for new agents especially, the stories, like the
houses, come with a very high price. Here, as in many other real
estate offices, senior members split their time between listings
(selling homes) and buyers, which are sometimes though not always the
same people. The newer agents tend to spend most of their time
working with first-time buyers, and working with first-time buyers in
a seller's market is frustrating, exhausting and often demoralizing.</TE>
<TE>   "People say to me, 'Gee, Ellie, this must be a great time for
you,'" said Ellie Viray, who has been a Realtor-associate for two
years. "And I think, in a way it is. But, in a way, it's also really
terrible."</TE>
<TE>   "Even under normal circumstances, buying and selling a house is
one of the most stressful things a person deals with, after death and
divorce," said Jack Cooley, branch manager for the office. "But now
it's even harder. Even for the sellers this market is just very
stressful."</TE>
<TE>   Real estate has long competed with Hollywood for top industry
billing in Southern California, and over the past year a healthy
growth has swelled into an unnerving surge. According to the
California Assn. of Realtors, in L.A. County low interest rates and
low inventory have cause the median price for a home to rise almost
20% in the last year to $267,000.</TE>
<TE>   All the things real estate agents learned in class--from the
timing and calculation of a bid to the protocol of an open
house--have been thrown out the window. In a world where houses sell
the day they go on the market; where it has become typical for
sellers to get eight or 10 offers, all of them significantly higher
than the asking price; where sellers are now so confident that they
are often unwilling to negotiate on even the smallest points, these
folks feel less like real estate agents and more like air traffic
controllers.</TE>
<TE>   Offers So High They Fail</TE>
<TE>   to Qualify for a Loan</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Cooley said, agents have had to deal with the unlikely
problem of offers that are just too high--that would not be signed
off on by a loan appraiser.</TE>
<TE>   "We had one house that got a bid for $670 [thousand], and the
appraiser came in and said this house is worth no more than $645
[thousand]," said Rowan. "So the bank will not OK the loan. Usually,
then the buyer and the seller work out a compromise--the seller comes
down, the buyer finds a little more money, but lately sellers have
just gotten greedy. We've seen people walk away from a deal rather
than lower the price, even when the appraiser says it's overpriced."</TE>
<TE>   This adds another layer of tension to an already tense
situation--agents are already warning prospective buyers that they
will have to overbid, only now they have to tell them "but not by too
much."</TE>
<TE>   "The pace is so intense I tell clients right up front that they
have to be willing to go over list price and they have to be willing
to pull the trigger instantly," said Jeff Maynard.</TE>
<TE>   Maynard, who has been in the business for four years, can say this
easily, confidently, like a firm but fair football coach or sergeant.
Some of the newer agents have a harder time.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not realize how difficult it would be for me to tell
someone, 'I know it's listed at $300,000, but it's going to go for
$330, so that is what we should offer,'" White said. "There is no way
that is going to come out of my mouth and sound good."</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes the clients simply don't believe it. Although even
first-time home buyers are better educated about the market than
ever, most are still shocked at the idea of overbidding, and many
balk. Until they lose a house or two.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it takes a while for the market to validate what I tell
them," said Jack Nesbit, who has been with Coldwell for almost a
year.</TE>
<TE>   "People come in and say, 'Well, my friend said this or my friend
did that," Viray said. "Friends are dangerous. Friends may ruin your
deal."</TE>
<TE>   After giving them this good news, the relationship enters its
hurry-up-and-wait phase. The low inventory that is driving housing
prices up is driving agents crazy. Many find that weeks go by during
which there are no houses to show their clients. And so they send
determinedly optimistic notes or make determinedly cheerful calls
just to let their clients know they haven't left town.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really hard when you have a buyer who is ready to go and
the competition is so fierce," Maynard said. "It's hard for them to
understand that where once there were 20 people looking for their
house, now there are 70 or 80. Folks on the Westside have been
dealing with this for years. That's why I'm seeing so many
Westsiders. But now it's all over the area."</TE>
<TE>   For most people, looking for a house is never just a three-week
proposition. But in this market, the relationship between client and
real estate agent can last longer than some marriages. "I had one
woman tell me that I talked to her husband more often than she did,"
White said.</TE>
<TE>   "You really become allies," Viray said. "You see a lot of these
people, and they get to know you pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   This makes success all the sweeter--the phone call informing a
client that he or she "got the house" has always been a great moment.
Now, it's on par with informing someone they've won the lottery.</TE>
<TE>   "You're high for days," White said.</TE>
<TE>   Agents Caught Between</TE>
<TE>   Buyers' Reason, Panic</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's not over until the fat lady, or the guy in the
escrow office, sings. Like everything else in the process, inspection
during escrow has become even more fraught. Sellers, who have often
turned down many other offers, are not exactly enthusiastic about
paying for such details as an ungrounded outlet, while the buyer, who
has paid 10% over list price, wants everything perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the middle are the agents. They have to appeal to the
seller's common sense (is it worth that $500 to start over with a new
buyer?) and the buyer's sheer panic. "Every buyer I have met thinks
everything is going to cost $10,000," Rowan said. "So we spend a lot
of time getting them plumbers and roofers and painters to tell them
exactly what it will cost, which is almost never $10,000."</TE>
<TE>   Then, she said, causing a hush to fall on the office, the parents
arrive.</TE>
<TE>   The parents, the other agents groan, oh right, the parents.</TE>
<TE>   Most first-time buyers, it would seem, wait until the inspection
process to show their parents their just-about-to-be new house.
Sometimes the parents have a financial stake in the purchase; they
almost always have an emotional stake.</TE>
<TE>   "Here come people who haven't bought a house in 20 years," White
said. "And they think this whole thing is just crazy. Paying this
much money. Paying over list. They find things wrong with the house
that the buyers just don't care about."</TE>
<TE>   But if the market is tough these days, it's also challenging
enough to draw in a younger and better educated workforce than ever
before. What often used to be a second or part-time career has now
got real legs on the job market.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of agents in their early 30s. We have two agents in
this office who are 21," Rowan said. "Five years ago, this was
unheard of. Unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   White became an agent after she and her husband had a
less-than-satisfactory experience buying a house. "I figured I could
do this much better," she said. "And I have been completely
surprised. I thought it was a sales position, that I'd try that for a
while and see how it went. But it's not that. It's much more
complicated than that."</TE>
<TE>   She, and many agents, wish the market would settle down almost as
much as prospective buyers do. "It doesn't seem fair to me that
someone making $60,000 a year can't afford a house in Pasadena," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   For more senior agents, the late hours spent writing offers for a
house seen that day, the evenings spent giving buyers pep talks and
keeping sellers from overpricing and hyperventilating, have
definitely been worth it, at least financially.</TE>
<TE>   "I've already done as much business as I did all of last year,"
Maynard said, "and last year was a good year."</TE>
<TE>   Still, even senior agents would like to see the market even out.
"We like a neutral market," Maynard said, "where sellers make money
but the buyers aren't getting clobbered."</TE>
<TE>   "It's just too hot," Cooley said. "I can't imagine that it can
continue. Of course," he added with a rueful laugh, "I said that
exact same thing this time last year."</TE>

<LD>Ignatz appeared on a platform in the center of a round room inside
the ship that looked like a big grasshopper. The walls were red and
lumpy. Lights flashed on the lumps. Sometimes clouds of green gas
were released into the air. Ignatz was surrounded by green creatures
who looked a little like grasshoppers. He didn't move. He showed no
fear.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't look dangerous," one of the creatures said.</LD>
<LD>   The head alien grasshopper poked Ignatz with a tentacle. "It is
soft," the alien said using a superior tone. "Its planet will be easy
to conquer."</LD>
<TE>   All the alien grasshoppers laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be tougher than it looks," another grasshopper suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps," the head grasshopper said. "We will find out." He poked
Ignatz again. "Tell us about the defenses of your planet," the head
grasshopper said.</TE>
<TE>   Ignatz said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Come now," the head grasshopper said. "Things will go easier for
you if you tell us what we want to know."</TE>
<TE>   Ignatz said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Very well," the head grasshopper said. "Let's see how you like
the silent treatment."</TE>
<TE>   The grasshoppers went away and left Ignatz alone for a long time
in the lumpy red room. Every now and then one of the grasshopper
creatures looked at Ignatz through a little hole in the door.</TE>
<TE>   Later the head grasshopper came back. "I suppose you are ready to
talk now," he said. "Tell me about the defenses of your planet. How
many ships? What sort of weapons?"</TE>
<TE>   Ignatz said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody home?" the head grasshopper asked as he tapped Ignatz on
the shoulder. Ignatz still did not respond.</TE>
<TE>   "So, you won't talk, eh?" the grasshopper said. "Very well, then.
No more Mr. Nice Guy."</TE>
<TE>   He watched Ignatz for any sign of weakness. Ignatz showed no fear.</TE>
<TE>   "Bring in the brain-a-lizer!" the head grasshopper ordered.</TE>

<DH>Victorian-era Wardian cases artfully display indoor gardens
while helping them thrive</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN DARDICK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Linda Chiavaroli and her husband, David Rosenbloom, like houseplants.
Unfortunately, so do their three cats. Following an episode--a final
episode--when feline Miranda sat on and broke a treasured potted
dracaena, the couple decided to give up on having plants indoors.
Until now.</LD>
<LD>   Growing in the living room of their Glassell Park house, untouched
by cat paws or teeth, are ferns and bromeliads, safely encased in an
ornate enclosure that is a throwback to Victorian times.</LD>
<LD>   This is no simple terrarium: It is a Wardian case, a glass and
metal structure designed to give plants a tropical home in grand
style. The cases had their heyday in England in the 1800s, and the
things that made them a hit in that era are becoming newly
appreciated in this one. The cases are named for their creator,
Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward, a London physician who stumbled on the
concept while pursuing a biology experiment.</LD>
<TE>   Most modern adaptations of the plants-under-glass idea are
terrariums, simpler in style and design. But recently, the charm and
practicality of the more ornate Wardian cases has been rediscovered.
"This solved a double problem for us," says Chiavaroli. "The indoor
plants are protected from the cats, and it also serves as a piece of
furniture."</TE>
<TE>   The Wardian case in the Chiavaroli-Rosenbloom home is more than 4
feet tall, in a rectangular style called "Essex House" (it measures
52 inches tall by 27 inches wide by 14 inches deep). A removable,
curved plexiglass roof, decorated with a Victorian floral relief
print on the hammered-metal edging, tops it off. It is one in a
series of cases designed and manufactured by Jerry Peed, whose
company, H. Potter, is based in Lincoln, Neb.</TE>
<TE>   About five years ago, Peed began making what he calls "a pretty
little house for your plants" by scaling down versions of English
conservatories. Using 20th century technology and materials, he based
his designs on the 19th century Wardian cases. He created a variety
of shapes and sizes, from small tabletop models to ornate 5-foot
cases made to display orchids.</TE>
<TE>   When Chiavaroli and Rosenbloom were on a trip to the San Francisco
Bay Area, they stopped to browse in a Los Gatos decorative arts
gallery, Studio Forty Two Gallery. They saw the cases and were
impressed by the quality and craftsmanship. "It's a decorative art
item that's really well made," said Rosenbloom, a professional
woodworker.</TE>
<TE>   The cases retail from $60 to $600 and are available through
Internet stores and land-based ones, including the Glass Garage and
La Bella Cosa in Los Angeles. Shirley Cooper, owner of English Creek
Gardens, an Internet retail site, is also a fan of Wardian cases and
sells H. Potter items. "They're wonderful for orchids, African
violets, ferns and miniature gardens," she said. "They're so
versatile."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper says the cases are popular with her customers who have
physical limitations that restrict their gardening. "They love
gardening in Wardian cases because of the ease of creating and caring
for these indoor gardens," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the cases came by happenstance to Ward, a physician
who practiced in London's East End in the early 1800s. In his spare
time, he studied botany and entomology. He tried to maintain a city
garden, but ferns and other greenery were barely surviving in the
notoriously polluted air of England's Industrial Age. In 1830, while
studying moths, he encased some moth larvae in a sealed glass jar. He
was astounded to find that a fern and some grass emerged from the
jar's soil.</TE>
<TE>   This chance event began a transformation that greatly affected
horticulture around the world. Ward hired a carpenter to build a case
for further research. In 1833, he conducted his first major
experiment by shipping two custom cases filled with British ferns and
grasses to Sydney, Australia. After a six-month ocean voyage, the
still-thriving plants reached their destination. Following Ward's
directions, the cases were cleaned and repacked with native
Australian plants that previously had been too delicate to ship.
After an arduous eight-month voyage, the plants reached Ward in
excellent condition.</TE>
<TE>   When he published the results of his tests with what he called
miniature greenhouses or fern houses, others followed his example.
Orchids and other exotic plants crossed the seas in their protective
glass enclosures. Industry was quick to follow. Robert Fortune used
the cases to ship 20,000 tea plants from Shanghai to the Assam region
of India, thus beginning a tea industry that still flourishes.</TE>
<TE>   Ward's display at a World's Fair set off the craze for these
unique glass structures that people termed Wardian cases.</TE>
<TE>   They were manufactured in a wide variety of sizes and in fanciful
shapes, like miniature Taj Mahals and Brighton Pavilions.</TE>
<TE>   While today's gardeners don't have to contend with the
coal-polluted air or the other issues the Victorians did, they do
have the problem of growing plants indoors where air conditioning and
forced-air heating create conditions that harm most foliage plants.
Wardian cases solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "They require very little attention because they recycle moisture
as the leaves release water vapor, which condenses on the glass,
trickles down into the soil and re-waters the plants," Peed says.
"Plants typically can go for one month before requiring supplemental
water."</TE>
<TE>   Most houseplants are tropical in origin, so they naturally thrive
in humidity. Guidelines for growing in Wardian cases include proper
selection of plants and keeping them away from direct sunlight.
Fertilizing is discouraged; plants are kept small by pinching new
growth.</TE>
<TE>   The case has turned out to be a valued addition to the
Chiavaroli-Rosenbloom household--and because they both work at home,
they are around it a lot. Chiavaroli runs United Arts, specializing
in marketing and public relations in the performing arts; Rosenbloom
designs and builds custom cabinets.</TE>
<TE>   The couple maintain an outdoor vegetable and herb garden
(Rosenbloom tends that) as well as the Wardian case (which Chiavaroli
tends).</TE>
<TE>   The plants do indeed thrive on minimal care. So far, she has only
needed to water the small plants occasionally, and she doesn't worry
about leaving them untended when she and her husband travel. Cats and
plants coexist, and the finely detailed Wardian case evokes a garden
tradition from another time and place.</TE>

<HD>Powdermilk Biscuits Meet Chili Dogs</HD>
<DH>Garrison Keillor's 'A Prairie Home Companion' is paying
another visit to L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>World-weary radio detective Guy Noir will once again be cruising the
streets of Los Angeles this week, leaving Lake Wobegon behind but
taking the Powdermilk Biscuits and Bebopareebop Rhubarb Pie with him.</LD>
<LD>   Garrison Keillor is bringing "A Prairie Home Companion" to the
Greek Theatre for a live show Saturday, to be broadcast on KPCC-FM
(89.3).</LD>
<LD>   The variety show with skits and songs--a throwback to radio
programs of the '30s, even down to the comical ads for fictional
products--has become a public-radio institution since it debuted in
1974. Every week, Keillor and his soothing voice lull listeners into
a dream state, transporting them to the imaginary Lake Wobegon,
Minn., the archetypal Midwestern small town.</LD>
<TE>   But what will Hollywood do to those Scandinavian immigrants and
their well-behaved children?</TE>
<TE>   "Midwesterners are very reserved and taciturn, and in a city with
so many newcomers, where society is so much more fluid and where
people are always hustling, reserve and taciturnity don't get you
much," Keillor said from St. Paul, Minn. In L.A., "you need to learn
to be attractive and charm people and put yourself forward in a
beneficial way. We're not brought up to do that here. We were brought
up to conceal ourselves and be wary of strangers and be modest."</TE>
<TE>   If Midwesterners of that variety are on Venice Beach or Sunset
Boulevard on a Saturday night, they must be concealing themselves
extremely well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to play with those stereotypes, but it's even more fun
when you realize how much truth there is to them," Keillor said.</TE>
<TE>   During "A Prairie Home Companion's" last visit to Southern
California, in May 2000 for a performance at the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium, Keillor joked about the L.A. weather, the Pasadena
Freeway and Hollywood chickens. He promised more prairie views of the
Pacific for this trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I want to deal with a couple who moved back to Lake
Wobegon after spending fortysome years in Los Angeles, in Lakewood.
Just an ordinary couple who moved out there in the late '50s, but who
always came back to work on the farm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They had packed up and gone to Los Angeles with a very romantic
notion in mind, that it was the land of opportunity. Instead, he
works in Los Angeles at about the same job he would in Lake Wobegon,
so there's a certain disappointment about paradise. The climate is
wonderful, but you get acclimated and it's not so pleasurable--it's
just the way things are."</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Young, KPCC general manager, said the quirks and foibles
played up in "Prairie Home's" stories and characters are simply a
veneer, shielding deeper truths.</TE>
<TE>   "The sense of humor that Garrison Keillor has, some people say,
'It's all small-town, how does that relate?' I think it's more human
nature, and how bittersweet that all is," Young said. "I grew up in a
town of 200 in Vermont, and I can recognize the characters. But
people have their hopes and dreams no matter where they are."</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for the Greek Theatre show, which begins at 2:45 p.m., are
$75, $65, $50 and $35. Guest performers will include Grammy-winning
blues, jazz and American roots musician Taj Mahal, mandolin and
fiddle player Peter Ostroushko, guitarist Greg Leisz, and Stephanie
Davis, a singer-songwriter who has appeared regularly on the show.
Also appearing will be Marnie Nixon, a singer who dubbed Natalie
Wood's voice in "West Side Story," Audrey Hepburn's in "My Fair Lady"
and Deborah Kerr's in "The King and I."</TE>
<TE>   The performance at the Greek begins the show's summer 2002 tour,
which will take Keillor and his ensemble to the Wolf Trap Foundation
for the Performing Arts, outside Washington, D.C.; to Kansas City,
Mo.; to Kettering, Ohio; and to Tanglewood at Lenox, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "We do 19 shows a year in St. Paul," Keillor said. "You don't want
to wear out your local audience."</TE>
<TE>   Keillor started taking the show on the road in 1976, two years
after it first went on the air. One year the cast and crew camped out
in tents during their travels. Another year they lived what sounds
like a bit from the program: "We were snowbound, on one tour, in
Sioux Falls, S.D. We were put up in the basement of a Lutheran
church. It was a long three or four days.</TE>
<TE>   "We drove around in campers and stayed in hotels with one sink in
the room and the toilet down the hall," he said. "We have moved up
now. We don't double up."</TE>
<TE>   Young said the last time the show was in town, fans without
tickets lined up at 8 a.m. waiting for cancellations. Now broadcast
on 530 stations in the United States, and heard by 3.36 million
listeners weekly, the program has become a phenomenon since it went
on the air 28 years ago, taking its name from the Prairie Home
cemetery in Moorhead, Minn. Young said the tour gives fans a chance
to be part of the show and see it created, up-close--an experience
Keillor said they might find unnerving.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've listened to a show for a long time, it builds your
curiosity. Then this guy walks out on stage and he isn't at all what
you expected--he's older, his eyebrows are bigger. Something isn't
quite right," he said. "Then you get over it and you enjoy the show."</TE>
<TE>   Young said her view of the program was altered, as well, when she
attended that Pasadena performance. She saw the choreography and
intricacy of the production, with Keillor writing all the songs and
tinkering with the script during the week, up until the last moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I just came away with this new-found appreciation of what I had
been hearing on the radio," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of the challenges, Keillor said producing a radio show
isn't nearly as daunting as staging an opera. His first, "Mr. and
Mrs. Olson," debuted last Friday night in St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrifying. It makes you realize how simple and magical
radio is. You can write a script with actors and sound effects. You
can write it on Friday and perform it on Saturday," Keillor said, and
not have to worry about coordinating songs and music and instruments.
"I'll be very glad to get back to radio, which I will in Los
Angeles."</TE>

<HD>Action Heroes for a Changing America</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Entertainment Weekly reviewed "The Scorpion King" last month,
the mainstream magazine's film critic described its star, the Rock,
as a typical All-American hero, calling him "a cross between Rob
Schneider and Tony Robbins ... at once exotic and square-jawed
suburban." But when Rolling Out, an African America weekly, put the
"Scorpion King" star on its cover last month, it embraced the World
Wrestling Federation behemoth as one of its own, calling him "a
brother" and touting the story with the tagline: "The Rock on Being
Black and Becoming a Movie Star...."</LD>
<LD>   Vin Diesel, who became an overnight star playing a scowling street
racer in last summer's "The Fast and the Furious," has been getting
similar dual treatment. Though he has played Italian Americans in
several films, including "Saving Private Ryan," he has been embraced
in the black community as African American. When Diesel was a
struggling actor, he made a short film called "Multi-Facial," which
showed him assuming different identities for his auditions, playing
an Italian street tough, hip-hop gangsta and buttoned-down preppie.</LD>
<TE>   The Rock is of black and Samoan heritage, while Diesel is
reportedly of black and Italian descent (he won't elaborate--"just
say I'm multicultural," he told US Weekly--and his production company
is called One Race). Now earning $10 million or more for each film
role, Diesel and the Rock are the new muscular box office kings
everyone can identify with: the multiethnic action hero.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the New Americans," says director Rob Cohen, who made
"The Fast and the Furious" and "XXX," a Diesel-starring
extreme-sports action film coming in August. "When you see these two
guys, you see how the epicenter of American culture has moved to the
urban centers of America, where different ethnic groups are rubbing
antennas with each other. You almost feel like Tom Cruise is too
straight today. To young moviegoers, Vin and the Rock are the epitome
of cool. Kids look at them and say, 'That's who I want to be.'"</TE>
<TE>   That's meant new marketing strategies for studios. "What we're
seeing is the browning of America," says Santiago Pozo, who has
served as marketing consultant for Universal films such as "The Mummy
Returns" and "Scorpion King." "So young moviegoers want black and
brown heroes. When they see the Rock or Vin Diesel, they recognize
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   To market "The Fast and the Furious" at clubs and concerts, Pozo
held casting sessions to make sure his street team marketers looked
just like the street racers in the movie. "I wanted to send a message
right from the beginning that they were in sync with what the film
was about."</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of Diesel and the Rock marks something of a seismic
shift in Hollywood which, despite its focus on youthful audiences,
has traditionally been the medium slowest to react to sociological
change.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to global reach, the action movie is Hollywood's
most potent cultural export. Films such as "A Beautiful Mind" win
Academy Awards, but movies like "Jurassic Park" and "Terminator 2"
reach the biggest worldwide audience, their explosions and special
effects translating an adrenaline-driven story line into any language
or culture.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the action hero has served as perhaps the most
accurate barometer of America's cultural preoccupations. John Wayne
was a symbol of American heroism and sense of purpose. Paul Newman
and Steve McQueen, the action heroes of the '60s, captured the
decade's free-spirited distrust of authority. In the 1970s, Clint
Eastwood's Dirty Harry symbolized the era's focus on crime and a loss
of ideals. In the mid-1980s, Sly Stallone's "Rambo" and Cruise's "Top
Gun" captured the jingoism of the stand-tall Reagan era, while action
series like "48 Hrs." and "Lethal Weapon" used the conflicts sparked
by their black and white co-stars to comment on the country's own
continuing racial divisions.</TE>
<TE>   It is hardly a secret that today's youthful moviegoers are far
more colorblind than any previous generation. For older America, the
voices of cultural authority largely remain white, whether it's news
anchors Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw, comics Jay Leno and David
Letterman or morning personalities like Katie Couric and Regis
Philbin. Young America has its own heroes. Thanks to the influence of
hip-hop, MTV, comedy and professional sports, they have a wide
multicultural array of icons, running the gamut from Jay-Z to
Jennifer Lopez, Kobe Bryant to Marc Anthony, Allen Iverson to Jackie
Chan, Shakira to Ja Rule, Eve to Chris Rock.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Hollywood has been slow to catch the multicultural
wave. When Cohen worked at Motown Films in the late 1970s, he says,
he couldn't book films like "Mahogany" and "The Wiz" in a theater
north of Wilshire Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "[Theater owner] Ted Mann thought if a black audience came to one
of his theaters, the white clientele would never come back," Cohen
recalls. Progress has been slowed by business disincentives. Movies
with Latino or African American stars have trouble selling overseas,
which now represents the biggest chunk of the movie marketplace. Last
summer, "Rush Hour 2" out-grossed "Jurassic Park III" in the U.S. by
$45 million, but overseas "Jurassic" made nearly $100 million more at
the box office than the Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan-starring action
comedy.</TE>
<TE>   These dismal overseas numbers could be changing, in part thanks to
more aggressive marketing strategies. Universal Pictures helped
organize a WWF tour of Asia with the Rock earlier this year to build
awareness for "Scorpion King's" international release, working
references to the movie into the plot lines of the wrestling matches.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy paid off. "Scorpion King" had the studio's biggest
opening of the year across Asia.</TE>
<TE>   But Hollywood also has an out-of-sight, out-of-mind problem. Its
executive suites remain alarmingly lily-white--most studios can't
even point to one black or Latino production vice president. Before
"The Fast and the Furious" was released, the heat--among white
industry-ites--was on co-star Paul Walker, not Diesel, who turned out
to be the movie's real drawing card. Too often, movie executives
don't notice the upheaval in today's pop culture until they walk into
their kids' bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "All my 9-year-old boy does is imitate black culture. To him,
that's what is cool," says Universal Pictures vice chairman Marc
Shmuger, whose studio has been a leader in multiethnic casting,
having made "Fast and the Furious" and "Scorpion King," among others.
"He wants to walk like Kobe Bryant and dress like Lil' Bow Wow. We'd
be crazy if we didn't try to reflect that in our movies."</TE>
<TE>   Universal, for example, recently teamed with Pozo's Arenas
Entertainment to launch the industry's first major Latino film
distribution company. The move was inspired, in part, by the studio's
realization that Latinos make up roughly one-third of the population
in America's top 15 movie markets and go to twice as many movies as
other Americans. Latinos made up more than 35% of the audience for
"Scorpion King," thanks to the Rock, who was already a huge drawing
card in the Hispanic community from his WWF exploits.</TE>
<TE>   Young moviegoers' identification with multiethnic pop and sports
stars has dramatically changed the way movie studios cast their new
films. "Scorpion King" features the Rock, Michael Clarke Duncan, who
is black, and Kelly Hu, who is Asian. Studio executives say the movie
would not have had such a racially mixed cast as recently as five
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be a fight to get a black character into a movie,"
says MTV Films senior exec David Gale. "Now the studios are all
saying, 'How can we find more black actors?'"</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood still has a long way to go, especially in terms of
embracing ethnicity in the executive ranks. But if the action hero is
the ultimate embodiment of our pop fantasies, the ascendancy of the
Rock and Diesel signals a potent cultural breakthrough. "They're the
new man, where all the racial contradictions are rolled up into one,"
says producer Stephanie Allain, who's making a film about black and
Latino biker clubs called "Biker Boyz."</TE>
<TE>   "What's cool in our culture has changed. My kid isn't the only
[mixed-race] kid around. Lots of his friends are. And when they see
Vin or the Rock, they just think the movies are reflecting real
life."</TE>

<DH>Pianist Marino Formenti pours himself into today's music</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By the time pianist Marino Formenti sits down to play, his Steinway
must be perfectly out of tune.</LD>
<LD>   Formenti, 36, spent a recent morning at Fields Pianos in West Los
Angeles, selecting the Steinways the dealer will lend to him for his
upcoming performances at the 2002 Ojai Music Festival. One piece in
his eclectic program, "Hommage a Ligeti" by Georg Friedrich Haas,
requires two pianos: one tuned in the standard way, the other with
each key "de-tuned" downward a quarter-tone.</LD>
<LD>   He will play both pianos, set at right angles, at the same time,
one with each hand.</LD>
<TE>   The piano will require several tuning sessions before it is
transferred to Ojai for the five-day festival, which begins
Wednesday. The instrument must acclimate to this bizarre treatment in
stages in order to hold on to the strange new tones.</TE>
<TE>   "When you play them together, it makes beautiful colors, very new
colors; it's like the invention of new colors by a painter, if you
can imagine," Formenti says excitedly--which is how he says
everything. "Shimmering--do you say shimmering?"</TE>
<TE>   Formenti, an Italian pianist who makes his home in Vienna, is not
always sure of the English word for what's on his mind, but he knows
his preferences in music--and in pianos.</TE>
<TE>   Music: contemporary. "To ask a pianist why he plays the music of
today is to ask a painter why he paints abstract paintings rather
than flowers, or Madonnas," he observes. "I am an artist living now,
I do things of now, in the language of now."</TE>
<TE>   Pianos: a much more personal issue. "That question is as difficult
to answer as: 'How do you choose your lovers?'--each piano is very
distinctive," Formenti muses. He adds that he prefers choosing pianos
to selecting lovers; less risk of rejection. "I choose. It is much
better," he says playfully.</TE>
<TE>   Food, he's less picky about. Thai, Indian, anything will do as
long as it's nearby--because he's coming back to the piano store to
do some more work after lunch. Formenti works all the time. "I am a
workaholic, I can't really enjoy doing nothing," Formenti admits,
over Indian food. He would like to acquire this skill. "Doing nothing
is a way to relax, and I am always on the edge. I live very much on
the edge."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it is Formenti's perpetual proximity to the edge of
workaholism ("I was a very nervous child") that has placed him on the
cusp of major critical acclaim--and has resulted in his invitation to
perform in Ojai, his first appearance with the festival, in three
diverse programs of music ranging from Beethoven to 21st century
piano compositions, including the world premiere of a new work by
Hanspeter Kyburz.</TE>
<TE>   The theme of the 56th annual Ojai Festival, which includes
educational seminars and also features the Emerson String Quartet,
singer Ute Lemper and guitarist Eliot Fisk, is "Last and Latest
Thoughts." For late, great composers, this means works from among
their last compositions; for the living ones, selections from their
most recent works.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Formenti makes his Ojai debut in the festival's
first marathon concert, a 6 p.m. to midnight event featuring both the
last and the latest, including works by the winners of the festival's
Young Composers' Awards.</TE>
<TE>   The festival, whose main venue is Ojai's outdoor Libbey Bowl, also
represents Formenti's first time playing outdoors, where the elements
will make it even more difficult to keep the Steinway out of tune.</TE>
<TE>   Formenti's first solo appearance in Los Angeles, in a series of
four concerts of 20th century music at the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art in April 2000, inspired Times music critic Mark Swed to place
Formenti--"wildly entertaining and technically astonishing"--on his
Top 10 list for that year.</TE>
<TE>   Swed has also noted this Olympic detail: In one LACMA concert,
Formenti played Jean Barraque's 45-minute Sonata in 23 minutes. In
2001, he shaved another minute off his personal best.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Register's Timothy Mangan has called Formenti "a
compelling performer who grabs you by both shoulders and shakes,"
adding that Formenti's challenging style is not one to enjoy with "a
leisurely brunch." And, in LA Weekly, Alan Rich confessed himself to
be still "obsessed with the memories" of the LACMA concerts more than
a year after the event.</TE>
<TE>   Ernest Fleischmann, artistic director of the Ojai Festival, first
encountered Formenti several years ago when the pianist was
performing as a member of Klangforum Wien, one of the top
contemporary-music ensembles in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really struck by the guy's fearlessness and personality; he
seemed to be able to play the most complicated and strange new music
and have no problems with it," Fleischmann says.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I heard him at one of the famous concerts at LACMA, and I
thought: 'Where has this guy been all my life?'"</TE>
<TE>   Fleischmann noted that one of the pieces Formenti will perform,
Alvin Lucier's "Nothing Is Real (Strawberry Fields Forever),"
requires that a teapot be placed inside the piano. "And the one that
requires two pianos will be wonderfully weird," Fleischmann adds.
"He's the perfect artist for Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   "But he doesn't just want to be known as an amazing performer of
new music--so I said, 'OK, show us,'" Fleischmann adds. "So at Ojai,
he will be playing the Schubert Sonata in B flat, one of the great
works of 19th century piano literature, and music from the composers
of Terezin concentration camp, which hardly anybody plays, and are
really fabulous."</TE>
<TE>   While preparing to play dueling pianos at Ojai, Formenti was also
doing double duty as assistant conductor to principal conductor Kent
Nagano for Los Angeles Opera's production of Puccini's "Turandot."</TE>
<TE>   The opera, left unfinished at the composer's death in 1924, now
has a new finale by Italian composer Luciano Berio (Formenti also
will perform the world premiere of Berio's "Sonata 2001" at Ojai).</TE>
<TE>   The assistant conductor's job is a behind-the-scenes gig that
required Formenti to accompany the singers in rehearsal in lieu of
the full orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Formenti, who admits to craving the spotlight, has a reason for
being willing to perform in this capacity: He really wants to
conduct. Opera, that is. "Many people have asked me why I am doing
this; it is because I am not as advanced in experience as I am as a
pianist," he says. "To me, to work with Kent Nagano is a gift.</TE>
<TE>   "I made my [conducting] debut in Gidon Kremer's Lockenhaus
[chamber music festival] in Austria six years ago, and he asked me to
accompany a violin concerto, and it was so much fun, I said, 'OK,
this is going to be my next goal.' And I love opera."</TE>
<TE>   "There is also this idea of being a leader of a group of people
who have the same goal," he adds. "I don't see it as the rule of a
Fuhrer; if you do it the right way, you feel the energy of everyone."</TE>
<TE>   And, despite his intimate relationship with the Steinways he
chooses, Formenti admits that sometimes being alone with a piano is
just not enough.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are a musician, you have a very direct contact with the
sound. This is also a very sensual, spiritual experience," he says.
"But when you are a piano player, you are not with anyone until you
get to the stage--that's why we love the stage."</TE>
<TE>   He laughs. "When you conduct, there is communication with other
people."</TE>

<HD>A Musical Picnic in Central Park</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playboy Jazz in Central Park is always the centerpiece for the annual
Old Pasadena Summer Fest, and this year's three-day event was no
exception. With a lineup ranging from Jeff Lorber and the Harvey
Mason Organization to Susie Hanson's Latin Jazz Band, the Banda
Brothers and Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band, there was a little
something for virtually every musical taste.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's program was a good example. Opening with the brightly
swinging Ron Kobayashi Trio, the genre level shifted quickly with the
arrival of the gospel-tinged sounds of Reverend Bill &amp; the Soul
Believers, followed by the surging salsa rhythms of the Hanson
ensemble. Undeterred by the discomfort of having to perform with her
broken foot in a cast, Hanson delivered her upbeat violin playing
with characteristically high-spirited enthusiasm.</LD>
<LD>   The Littleton Brothers offered yet another style switch with a
program blending hard bop lines with Latin rhythms (with special
effectiveness on Wayne Shorter's "Footprints") and tossing in a
soulful blues or two for seasoning. Enhanced by a front line
consisting of saxophonist Charles Owens and trumpeter Shaheed Nolan,
the soloing was first rate, powerfully supported by pianist Danny
Grissett and the two-brothers rhythm team of drummer Don and bassist

<TE>   Big-band jazz in all its glory came next via the superbly crafted
sounds of Goodwin's Big Phat Band. Performing a program largely drawn
from the ensemble's highly praised debut album, "Swingin' for the
Fences," the ensemble and its all-star array of soloists romped
through numbers such as "Sing, Sang, Sung" (a new take on the Benny
Goodman swing-era classic, "Sing, Sing, Sing") and the album title
track (based on the chords of "Sweet Georgia Brown"). At a time when
big-band jazz rarely receives the exposure it deserves, the
enthusiastic reception that greeted the Phat Band's performance
offered potent testimony to the genre's persistent capacity to excite
and entertain.</TE>
<TE>   Drummer Harvey Mason's Organization wrapped the day with a set of
numbers displaying a sense of drive and swing not often found in the
smooth jazz/funk genre. Mason's irrepressible drumming took the lead,
enhanced by the solid keyboard work of John Beasley, rendering such
odd selections as "Take Five" (performed in 4/4 meter rather than the
original 5/4) with engaging style and substance.</TE>
<TE>   For the overflow crowd, it all added up to a colorful musical
menu, offered on a gorgeous, blue-sky California afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   And it was no wonder that the Summer Fest producers were informed
by the Pasadena Police Department that overall attendance for the
three-day event was expected to surpass the 125,000 who turned out
for last year's programs.</TE>

<HD>'Harry' Is Keeping His Secrets, for Now</HD>
<DH>Video * The DVD does not include a director's commentary or
some other typical features.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warner Home Video doesn't want Muggles to know the secrets behind the
movie magic of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." So don't look
for any audio commentaries or "how the film was made" featurettes on
the double-disc DVD ($27) that arrives in stores today in both
full-screen and wide-screen editions. A VHS version is also available
for $25.</LD>
<LD>   "We wanted to set this DVD apart by keeping it in the world of
Harry, knowing that it is a disc appealing to younger viewers," says
Paul Hemstreet, vice president of special features/DVD for Warner
Home Video. So while it is loaded with extras, they aren't the kind
that DVD fans are most accustomed to.</LD>
<LD>   For those, they'll have to wait for a second DVD issue, release
date unknown.</LD>
<TE>   Director Chris Columbus, already busy on the second film in the
series, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," due for release
this fall, "has expressed a desire at some point to go back and do
commentary," Hemstreet says, and Warner Home Video has massive
amounts of behind-the-scenes footage shot during the production of
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" last year in England.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day was documented," Hemstreet says. "We had crew there.
There is a tremendous amount of information that could be used, but
we didn't want to cross that line at this point and show the wires."</TE>
<TE>   "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," based on J.K. Rowling's
phenomenally successful novel, stars Daniel Radcliffe as the orphan
boy who learns on his 11th birthday that his late parents were
powerful wizards and that he has inherited their magical powers. The
film raked in more than $320 million in U.S. ticket sales and is
expected to bring in another bundle on the home video market.</TE>
<TE>   The first disc of the DVD is the movie itself; the second is
comprised of a series of interactive features that ultimately allow
viewers to access deleted scenes. (The VHS also includes the excised
scenes.) Among the DVD's other features:</TE>
<TE>   * An interactive tour of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry, including the Great Hall, Harry's bedroom and the
Gryffindor Common Room.</TE>
<TE>   * A visit to the classrooms of professors Snape, McGonagall and
Flitwick.</TE>
<TE>   * Interviews with Columbus and producer David Heyman.</TE>
<TE>   * A visit to Diagon Alley that allows viewers access to Gringott's
Bank, Ollivander's Wands and Eeylops Owl Emporium.</TE>
<TE>   * A lesson in the game of Quidditch, played on flying brooms.</TE>
<TE>   * A visit to the Hogwarts library.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed natural to have a tour of Hogwarts," Hemstreet says.
"These incredible sets are really built at 360 degrees and the detail
was incredible. We wanted to convey that and show it in a fun way."</TE>
<TE>   There are more features if the DVD is played on a computer. There,
thanks to One Voice Technologies, the One Voice option on the DVD-ROM
gives viewers the opportunity to navigate the extras by speaking
directly into the computer's microphone. The commands are available
in English, French, Spanish, German and Italian.</TE>
<TE>   Once into the DVD-ROM, viewers can take a personalized tour of
Hogwarts, play several interactive games, enjoy trading cards and
personalized owl e-mails and even be sorted into one of Hogwarts'
houses.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Home Video began working on the DVD extras while the film
was still in production; they were nearly a year in the making.
Hemstreet and his staff consulted Columbus and Heyman throughout the
process. Rowling, though, wasn't involved in the planning. "She was
very busy with certain things having to do with the release of the
theatrical film and also with the writing of her next book,"
Hemstreet explains. "She had a very full agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Though Warner Home Video has been heavily publicizing the DVD
release of "Harry Potter," Hemstreet becomes a virtual chamber of
secrets as to how many copies are being shipped to stores.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Amazon.com "Hit List," though, illustrates the
magnitude of fans' demand for the title. The wide-screen version of
"Harry Potter" has spent 14 weeks at No. 1 on the DVD best-seller
list since becoming available for pre-order on Feb. 5. The
full-screen edition is currently No. 4 and the VHS version has spent
15 weeks at the No. 1 spot on the video best-seller list.</TE>

<HD>The 'Late,' Semi-Great Modernist</HD>
<DH>UCLA Hammer exhibition highlights Milton Avery's homespun
1950s works. But his relevance to art history is overstated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Milton Avery is a Modern artist for people who don't like Modern art.
His formulaic work of the 1950s merges the earnest goodwill of
American folk art with the picturesque color of School of Paris
painting. The result is old-fashioned sentiment given a veneer of
experimental adventure. It's avant-garde lite.</LD>
<LD>   At the UCLA Hammer Museum, "Milton Avery: The Late Paintings"
flogs his 1950s work in a tortured effort to assert its illuminating
relevance to the period. The show, organized and circulated by the
American Federation of Arts, in fact demonstrates something else
entirely.</LD>
<LD>   It is a clear example of the way in which New York regionalism is
still relentlessly projected as the authentic, meaningful centerpiece
of contemporary American art history. Had Avery worked anywhere else
in the United States in the 1950s--or had he stayed in Hartford,
Conn., where he first took up painting in 1911--this exhibition would
never have been organized, much less gone on tour. (Originally
scheduled for museums in Milwaukee and West Palm Beach, Fla., it was
added to the Hammer's schedule at the last minute, when the UCLA
museum's renovation plan was delayed.)</LD>
<TE>   Avery would be regarded today as a pleasant painter whose interest
in color was important to his infinitely more talented friends, Mark
Rothko and Barnett Newman, but who thrashed around for 50 years in
futile search of his own significant style.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, "Milton Avery: The Late Paintings" adopts a pretentious
title--drumroll, please--even though virtually no one champions the
tedious paintings of his first 40 years. Then "The Late Paintings"
slices and dices an already narrow sliver of career into fine mince.</TE>
<TE>   The show includes 50 paintings, the earliest dating from 1947.
One, "White Nude #2," was made in 1963, when poor health forced Avery
to stop painting.</TE>
<TE>   As with his prewar paintings of the American Scene, Avery
continued to paint landscapes, still-lifes, women in interiors and
other depictions of daily life in the 1950s. What drained away was
the reportorial specificity of the earlier work. In its place, Avery
made radically simplified forms. Large, often organic shapes lock
together like pieces in a puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   The shapes are built from layered, atmospheric color. Color was
Avery's strong suit--although he wasn't especially inventive with it.</TE>
<TE>   Matisse was his hero. Everything from the Frenchman's odalisques
to his stool-top still-lifes will be found in Avery's compositions.
"March on the Balcony" (1952), which shows a young woman seated at a
seaside French window with a sailboat glimpsed in the distance, pays
homage to Matisse's famous (and far more riveting) "Open Window,
Collioure" (1905).</TE>
<TE>   The surprising chromatic juxtapositions of Pierre Bonnard, the
jagged shapes in Georges Braque and even the primitive elongation in
Amadeo Modigliani turn up in Avery's paintings. The aggressive punch
of his predecessors' work, however, is typically tamped down.</TE>
<TE>   Avery might wedge a khaki green shape between a sherbet orange and
a teal blue one; more often he mixes his jangling colors with white,
softening the tone and emphasizing a continuous surface. Harmony
prevails.</TE>
<TE>   His color tends to be gauzy and atmospheric, an effect achieved
through layering and scraping. (He also always primed the canvas
first.) Orange is thinned and brushed over blue-gray-green, or violet
is brushed over blue.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere a large field of pink over violet butts against a field
of violet over pink, creating a lush but gentle reversal of space. In
a still-life, an orange vase has been scratched with the stick end of
the brush so that the golden yellow under-painting flickers through
in jagged lines. These are the sorts of effects that Newman and
especially Rothko admired in their older peer.</TE>
<TE>   A folk-art quality also marks Avery's paintings, partly deriving
from his admiration for the small, romantic, tone-on-tone paintings
of turn-of-the-century visionary artist Albert Pinkham Ryder.
(Jackson Pollock was also a Ryder fan, and the distant sailboat in
Avery's "March on the Balcony" is lifted from Ryder's signature
marine painting in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.)
Avery's simplified forms feel cobbled together with diligence and
care. These are well-made pictures, crafted with Yankee pride.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition interprets these tranquil, homespun paintings as an
expression of stability and calm that appealed to Americans weary of
the fear and chaos brought on first by the Great Depression and then,
convulsively, by World War II. Avery offered a balanced aesthetic
vision--homeland security--appropriate to the social and political
milieu of Cold War containment.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps--but I don't think that reading goes nearly far enough.</TE>
<TE>   For Avery's art offers a specific kind of tranquillity, one
earnestly American in character but still easily identified with
School of Paris painting. It connects war-ravaged Paris, capital of
the decimated avant-garde, with New York City, which was being
promoted as the inheritor of Europe's cultural legacy. Avery was a
bridge--a Pont des Arts, if you will.</TE>
<TE>   The promotion of New York regionalism as the national standard was
well underway in the 1950s. We tend to think of regional art as
having been made elsewhere in the United States--Thomas Hart Benton
in Missouri, Grant Wood in Iowa or Stanton Macdonald Wright in Los
Angeles. But the New York School was as regional as any other. Its
endorsement as the nationwide benchmark continues apace, with Avery
once again trotted out as a hearty (though refined) exemplar.</TE>
<TE>   This process was bolstered four years after his death in 1965 (he
was born in 1893) when Washington's National Museum of American Art
mounted a full-scale Avery retrospective. It met some critical
resistance for including a full complement of his earliest work, from
before World War I as well as paintings of everyday American life,
which busied him until shortly after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   That "misstep" was rectified in 1982, when New York's Whitney
Museum of American Art mounted a second retrospective. This one
devoted two-thirds of its space to his work from the 1950s; the
paintings of his first four decades provided a short introduction.</TE>
<TE>   Now even that brief background has been jettisoned.</TE>
<TE>   So I look forward to a future analysis (in 2020, perhaps?), when
the focus can be narrowed even further. "Milton Avery: The Marine
Paintings, circa 1958" could chronicle the fleeting eruption of a
handful of paintings of the sea that chuck the safe harbor of peace
and tranquillity. Courting mystery and visual contentiousness, a la
Ryder, they exhibit what might be called true grit.</TE>

<HD>He Has a Way With the Ladies</HD>
<DH>Pop Music*Country singer Kenny Chesney crosses the charts
as he says the things that women want to hear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You could whip up all sorts of complicated explanations for how
country singer Kenny Chesney caught everyone outside his fan club and
record company by surprise this month by landing his latest album at
No. 1, not just on country charts but on pop charts as well.</LD>
<LD>   But looking around during his concert Saturday at Blockbuster
Pavilion in Devore, on his first headlining tour of arenas and
amphitheaters, it was clear the answer boils down to one thing:
women.</LD>
<LD>   Women don't just like Chesney. They loooove this buff 34-year-old
out of little Luttrell, Tenn.</LD>
<TE>   It's not just his sex appeal, though, that's a big factor in the
rapid upward swing of his career arc in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "His tractor is sexy," said 23-year-old Lorie Sellas of Highland,
one of thousands of young women happily salivating over Chesney on
Saturday. "If he were three inches taller, I'd marry him."</TE>
<TE>   Women, outnumbering men three or four to one, were all smiles,
singing along to lyrics you'd think they'd tattooed on their
hearts--even those from the 3-week-old "No Shoes, No Shirt, No
Problems" album.</TE>
<TE>   As much as female fans hooted approval at his bicep-baring tight
red tank top, many also kept urging him to lose it.</TE>
<TE>   But even more than teasingly playful tunes, a la his 1999 hit "She
Thinks My Tractor's Sexy," what's quietly turned Chesney into one of
country's new heavyweights is the hyper-romanticism of ballads such
as "She's Got It All," "I Lost It" and his ode to lifetime
commitment, "How Forever Feels."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my God," said 19-year-old Meghan Hunt of Riverside, sitting
on the grass far from the stage a few minutes before Chesney arrived.
"He sings what women want to hear, and it's all true too."</TE>
<TE>   Some critics have accused him of pandering to the young women in
his audience, but to Chesney it's catering, something that comes
naturally to the son of a single mom with only one sibling, a half
sister who is eight years younger.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the kind of stuff that my mom used to have to go through,
so I'm sensitive to that," Chesney said earlier in the week during an
interview on the rooftop of his West Hollywood hotel, where he'd
pulled up a chair to catch some early afternoon sun.</TE>
<TE>   "Conway Twitty used to say he was singing all the things that
women wanted to hear from their husbands and boyfriends that they
could never say. In a way I'm sort of continuing that tradition."</TE>
<TE>   With the "No Shoes" album, however, Chesney, who also headlines
Thursday at the Greek Theatre, feels he's breaking from his own
tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first record I've ever done where I feel like there's
a little of me in every song. And there's a lot of me in a lot of the
songs," he says. "On my other albums, there were maybe three or four
things I really related to. Sometimes I've recorded a song because I
thought it might be a great radio record."</TE>
<TE>   Two things made "No Shoes" different: extra time afforded him by a
greatest hits album released after his previous studio album,
"Everywhere We Go," and new life realizations after he and his
fiancee called off their engagement three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "When that didn't happen, I went through a lot of soul searching,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I grew up a little bit, and that can be hard for a guy.
Losing something or someone you really love forces you to grow up,
and I think these songs reflect the different maturity level I have
in my life now, that I didn't have when I recorded 'Tractor.'"</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, "No Shoes" includes songs that reflect on mistakes ("A Lot
of Things Different"), that express appreciation for what one does
have ("The Good Stuff") and that express respect and love for another
even when things didn't work out ("On the Coast of Somewhere
Beautiful").</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest stretch, for both Chesney and his audience, is
his rendition of Bruce Springsteen's "One Step Up," from
Springsteen's 1987 "Tunnel of Love" album.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always really loved the song, but I had no idea that one day
I would painfully learn the lesson of it," he says. "I almost
recorded it a couple of albums back, but I'm glad I waited until I
had lived it."</TE>
<TE>   He says he's also glad his commercial success is happening now
instead of earlier in a career that began nearly a dozen years ago.
Thanks to the slow build before he posted two albums that have topped
sales of 1 million apiece ("Everywhere" and "Greatest Hits"), Chesney
thinks he's better prepared for the attention he's getting from his
No. 1 debut on the Billboard Pop Albums chart.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, shortly before Billboard made it official, RCA Label
Group Chairman Joe Galante took Chesney aside and gave him a little
speech, based on what he'd witnessed when Alan Jackson accomplished
the same feat earlier this year with his album "Drive," propelled by
the Sept. 11-inspired song "Where Were You (When the World Stopped
Turning)."</TE>
<TE>   "I happened to be at a worldwide management meeting when that came
out," Galante says. "All of a sudden these [other music-industry
executives] are all asking 'Who ... is Alan Jackson?' and Alan
obviously was a much bigger star. So here's this kid whose album is
going to debut above all the hip-hop, alternative and rock releases.
I knew people would pick up the paper and say 'God Almighty, who is
Kenny Chesney?'</TE>
<TE>   "We [at RCA] knew it was coming, but nobody else seemed to pick up
on it, including most people in Nashville," Galante adds. "What Kenny
did was through hard work. He's got a great album, he puts on a great
show and he's put in years of hard work getting here. It's like they
say, he did it the old-fashioned way: He earned it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Chesney will be joined by Montgomery Gentry and others
Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Greek Theatre, 2700 Vermont Road, L.A.
(323) 665-1927. $28.50-$59.50.</TE>

<LD>   A&amp;E Turns the Tables With 'Benedict Arnold'</LD>
<LD>   While lots of programmers have been focusing on heroes since the
events of Sept. 11, cable's A&amp;E Network is taking a different tack
with "Traitor: Benedict Arnold."</LD>
<TE>   The TV movie is filming in Ireland, with Aidan Quinn as the famed
American turncoat and Kelsey Grammer as his commander in the
Revolutionary Army, Gen. George Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the works for A&amp;E's 2002-03 schedule are a six-hour drama
about Napoleon, starring Gerard Depardieu, John Malkovich, Christian
Clavier and Isabella Rossellini, and "The Lost World," an adaptation
of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's dinosaur tale starring Bob Hoskins and
Peter Falk.</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Pianist Need Not Be Present to Win</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Twin Cities' International Piano-e-Competition, to be
held June 6 through 14, is billed as a first for a "serious" piano
contest. All the performers and two of the judges--pianists Yefim
Bronfman and Emanual Ax--will be participating long distance.</TE>
<TE>   The brainchild of University of Minnesota music professor
Alexander Braginsky and Jeffrey Wirth, owner of Minneapolis' Grand
Hotel, the contest will rely on the Yamaha Disklavier, a digital
acoustic piano. Created in the mid-1980s, the machine captures the
speed of the fingering, the timing of the foot-pumps, even how
crisply the musicians lift their fingers off the keys.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty aspiring concert pianists will have their music saved on
floppy diskettes to be re-created on the piano, as judges from seven
countries look on.</TE>
<TE>   Images of each performer, transmitted through cyberspace, will be
simultaneously displayed on a large digital monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Bronfman and Ax will assess the performance via the Web rather
than from Minneapolis' Orchestra Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Although Internet duets featuring players in different cities have
occurred before, no formal competitions have exploited the
technology, a spokesman for Yamaha's piano division said.</TE>
<TE>   Scarlett Must Dance on Another Day</TE>
<TE>   "Tomorrow is another day." So said Scarlett O'Hara and so says the
Atlanta Ballet about a dance version of her story. The company had
planned to create a new work based on "Gone With the Wind" for its
75th-anniversary season in 2005 but has had to shelve the notion
indefinitely because of financial problems, the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution reports.</TE>
<TE>   "The financial commitment is very high, and it is not judicious to
launch an endeavor of this scope," said Sam Moss, board chairman of
the ballet company, which is trying to reduce its debt and balance
its budget.</TE>
<TE>   Waiter Confesses: He Stole 239 Art Treasures</TE>
<TE>   A 31-year-old French waiter has confessed to stealing 239 art
treasures from 172 museums and antique shops in seven European
countries, prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   Stephane Breitwieser, who was arrested in Switzerland last
November, told police his six-year spree was motivated by a love of
art rather than avarice, a public prosecutor, Emil Birchler, was
quoted as saying in the Guardian, a London newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   His take included more than 60 canvases from the 16th, 17th and
18th centuries, including works by Watteau and Breughel, that are
said to have been destroyed by his mother, Mireille. She told French
police that, shortly after her son was arrested, she cut them up and
threw them into the garbage because "the house absolutely had to be
wiped clean."</TE>
<TE>   The items, stolen in France, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany,
Holland, Denmark and Austria, were taken from small museums where
security was lax. According to prosecutors, it was unclear how much
they were worth because only 10% of the owners have come forward.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Soprano Kathleen Battle, actress-singer Bernadette Peters and
songwriter Randy Newman will be inducted into the Hollywood Bowl Hall
of Fame on June 28.... Despite a Tony Award nomination for its star,
Billy Crudup, the Broadway revival of "The Elephant Man" will close
June 9 after a run of only 65 performances, far fewer then the
900-plus chalked up by the 1979 original.... Michael Douglas, Halle
Berry, Jodie Foster and Mike Myers are among the celebrities
attending Paramount Pictures' 90th-anniversary gala on July 14. Annie
Leibovitz will take a group photo in front of the legendary studio
gates for the October issue of Vanity Fair.... CBS has given the
go-ahead to "The Battle of Mary Kay," a comedy about cosmetics
magnate Mary Kay Ash, who died in November. Shirley MacLaine will
star.... Annette Bening will take on her first big-screen role in two
years, playing a widowed mother in a Disney remake of the 1976 movie
"Freaky Friday," according to the Hollywood Reporter.... Harrison
Ford has agreed to star in Universal Pictures' big-screen adaptation
of Lawrence Block's "A Walk Among the Tombstones" for Jersey Films,
about a recovering-alcoholic private eye.</TE>

<HD>'Clones,' 'Spider-Man' Lead Holiday Weekend to a Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An army of manufactured clones and an anthropomorphic spider
dominated a record Memorial Day weekend at the nation's movie
theaters.</LD>
<LD>   The twin blockbusters "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones"
and "Spider-Man" continued to climb the all-time best-grossing film
charts, but there was enough room for three new arrivals to
distinguish themselves: the suspense films "Insomnia" and "Enough,"
and the new family animated movie "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron."</LD>
<LD>   The top 12 movies grossed an estimated $193 million for the
four-day period, according to box-office tracking firm Exhibitor
Relations, sailing past last year's previous record by nearly 9%.
That brings the box office year-to-date figure to about $3.5 billion.</LD>
<TE>   As expected, "Attack of the Clones" was the top-grossing film,
posting an estimated $61.2 million over the four-day holiday in 3,161
theaters and about 6,000 screens--only a 41% second-weekend drop--and
an average take of more than $19,000 a theater.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past 12 days, "Clones" has clocked $202.5 million,
crossing the $200-million threshold a day ahead of its predecessor
and three days behind "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   Still, "Clones" will continue to be measured against the giddy
heights already achieved by "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Sam Raimi's live-action comic book topped $300 million,
getting there in a record 22 days ("Phantom Menace" did it in 28).
Over the four-day holiday, "Spider-Man" registered an estimated $36.5
million in 3,875 theaters and more than 7,500 screens.</TE>
<TE>   With $334.3 million tallied so far, it's already the
sixth-largest-grossing film of all time in the United States after
only a month in release.</TE>
<TE>   Now Spidey's going after fifth place--"Jurassic Park" ($357
million)--and stands a chance of reaching "Phantom Menace's"
$431-million total, the second-highest tally, before it's through
("Titanic" is No. 1 with $600 million).</TE>
<TE>   Audiences eager for alternatives turned to effects-less movies
such as third-place "Insomnia," Christopher Nolan's remake of a
recent-vintage Norwegian cop drama. The first four days for the
well-reviewed film, starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams, came in at
about $26.2 million in 2,610 theaters, attracting a fairly evenly
mixed audience in terms of age and gender.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks' latest animated feature, "Spirit: Stallion of the
Cimarron," broke through with the family audience and younger women
for a strong fourth-place finish estimated at $23 million in its
first four days in 3,317 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Having established a foothold, "Spirit" is looking toward even
greener pastures over the next several weeks as schools across the
nation empty out and a pattern of consistent midweek attendance takes
hold.</TE>
<TE>   Not until the live-action film version of the popular cartoon
series "Scooby-Doo" arrives on June 14 will "Spirit" have any
head-to-head competition.</TE>
<TE>   Critics were cool to Jennifer Lopez's woman-in-peril thriller
"Enough," which opened in fifth place with an estimated $17.5 million
in 2,623 theaters, drawing younger females and a broad ethnic mix,
according to Sony marketing/distribution head Jeff Blake.</TE>
<TE>   The British arrested-development comedy "About a Boy," starring
Hugh Grant, is doing moderately well, especially considering the
competition. In its second weekend, the film expanded to 1,749
theaters and climbed to an estimated $10 million for an 11-day total
of nearly $22 million. "Unfaithful," starring Richard Gere and Diane
Lane, also got a bump from the holiday, with $7.7 million in 2,401
theaters and a three-week total of more than $41 million.</TE>
<TE>   Teens were still showing up for "The New Guy" in its third
weekend, which brought in about $5.5 million in 2,374 theaters for a
total to date of $24. 5 million.</TE>
<TE>   In ninth place, audiences were still catching up with "Changing
Lanes," the longest-lived movie in the top 10, which grossed an
estimated $2 million in 1,258 theaters for a total of nearly $65
million.</TE>
<TE>   In 10th place was "The Scorpion King," which is nearing the end of
a profitable run with about $1.9 million in 1,527 theaters and a
six-week total of $88 million.</TE>
<TE>   Among the specialized releases, the biggest splash came from "The
Importance of Being Earnest," a new adaptation of the classic Oscar
Wilde comedy, which got off to a dandy start with $470,000 on 38
screens--more than $12,000 a theater. The film expands to 125 screens
this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Roman Coppola's exploration of the 1960s, "CQ," got off to a
$43,000 start on seven screens in New York and Los Angeles. "Enigma"
continues to draw an audience, with $429,000 in 102 theaters, for
$1.8 million to date.</TE>

<HD>Warhol's Saving Plan Pays Odd Dividends</HD>
<DH>Art* If soup cans seem banal, what will posterity make of
boxes of matchbooks, menus, bug-ridden food, and occasional
treasures?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TODD SPANGLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>If you think Andy Warhol's art celebrated the seemingly banal, you
should just get a look at the stuff he decided to keep for posterity.</LD>
<LD>   The man was an inveterate pack rat.</LD>
<LD>   Memos and letters. Receipts. Junk mail and cigarette packs. In
cardboard boxes stuffed full of clutter by the late pop-art icon and
his workers, the flotsam of life--including cheap religious
portraits, in-flight menus and boxing posters--mingles with items
like a pair of Clark Gable's shoes and Warhol's own hand-crafted
artwork.</LD>
<TE>   One box contained a gift from Salvador Dali: wax paper palettes
the painter had used. Another featured a Jean Harlow dress, shoved
inside a manila envelope. A third held rancid pizza dough, crawling
with bugs.</TE>
<TE>   One held a gentle gold-leaf relief of a flower on paper, signed as
an authentic Warhol (by his mother, who did such tasks for him in the
1950s).</TE>
<TE>   And that's only in the hundred or so boxes they've gotten around
to opening at the Andy Warhol Museum here. There are hundreds
more--in all, more than 600 boxes, files and trunks--the museum staff
hasn't had time to crack.</TE>
<TE>   "Opening a box is a real pain," said assistant archivist Matt
Wrbican, who has opened his share and remembers a particularly
tedious month spent cataloging the items in a box full of mail. "It
could be another bug infestation. You don't know what's coming."</TE>
<TE>   That, apparently, was Warhol's aim.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime in the 1960s--and with much more regimentation by the
mid-1970s--Warhol and his colleagues started putting part of the
clutter growing around the artist at the Factory (his New York
studio) and at his home into boxes. Most are dated; some have
headings. On one, with ticket stubs, salt-and-pepper containers and
little liquor bottles from the Concorde, is scrawled "Air France" by
Warhol.</TE>
<TE>   Most are labeled "T.C."--for time capsule--suggesting that Warhol,
who made his fortune and fame by turning seemingly banal marketing
images of soup cans and celebrities into art, knew exactly what he
was doing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of our time capsules as the Rosetta Stone of Warhol's
work," said Thomas Sokolowski, the director of the museum, which got
the boxes after the artist's death in 1987. "We never know what we're
going to find.... It's part lottery, that notion of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Warhol, who was born in Pittsburgh in 1928, was not just a pack
rat but also a serious collector. In a recent show at the museum
titled "Possession Obsession," archivist John Smith put together some
of Warhol's prized possessions, many of which were sold at a
Sotheby's auction in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   They ranged from the whimsical--more than 100 ceramic cookie jars,
for example--to fine pieces of 19th-century American furniture, Art
Deco silver and cigarette cases and Navajo blankets.</TE>
<TE>   There is an enormous plaster bust of a young Napoleon, by Canova.
There is also a painting of Johnny Weissmuller, the swimmer who
played an early movie Tarzan.</TE>
<TE>   By the time of his death, Warhol's collection of stuff had taken
over his home; only a few rooms, such as the kitchen and bedroom,
were usable. Although friends tried to focus his collecting habits,
"he couldn't resist going to the flea market," said Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "It's that idea of always looking for a bargain" and of not being
able to throw away anything.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Wrbican have a friendly disagreement about what Warhol
intended to do with the time capsules, if anything. Wrbican
believes--and can point to some discussions Warhol had with others to
back it up--that the artist wanted to sell them, for as much as
$5,000 a box. The buyer would put money down and get one of them,
without knowing anything about the contents before opening it.</TE>
<TE>   Surprise! Stale cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith doesn't believe that because Warhol was a very private
person, even given his public persona. To have given up these items,
however mundane, would have violated that privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much more he could have sold," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, it's left to the archivists, when they have time, to
get one of the boxes, don gloves and start going through what has
been left, documenting each item.</TE>
<TE>   It might be old magazines or a piece of cake from a Kennedy
birthday. It might be a maid's outfit or newspaper headlines. Or it
could be the cover of a French porn magazine with a model clutching a
Mickey Mouse doll to her bosom.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol's Great Dane Is Stuffed With Arsenic</TE>
<TE>   Once documented, the stuff goes back into the boxes, unless it
requires more careful preservation. Some of the items become part of
exhibits; the museum typically keeps the contents of one of the boxes
on display in the Warhol's archive study center.</TE>
<TE>   Standing next to "Cecil," a stuffed Great Dane (filled with
arsenic to keep insects from eating it) that belonged to Warhol,
Wrbican describes how he recently opened a box apparently from the
early '70s, not knowing if he'd find spoiled food or money or
matchbooks inside.</TE>
<TE>   What he found was a change-of-address announcement handmade by
Warhol, and a series of hand-colored drawings of fingers clutching at
flowers.</TE>
<TE>   At the bottom of the box is a paper bag, and inside a cheap,
plastic hologram image of the Last Supper, the subject of a series of
works by Warhol.</TE>
<TE>   On the bag itself is printed the words, "Thank you, please come
again."</TE>

<HD>'Star Wars' Contributor Praises Lucas for His Vision</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SRAGOW</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So you wonder what film writer-director Lawrence Kasdan really thinks
of George Lucas, creator of the "Star Wars" films? With the release
of "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones," the newest
installment of the Lucas film series, he spoke about Lucas in a
telephone interview from Vancouver, British Columbia, where he's
directing Stephen King's "Dreamcatcher."</LD>
<LD>   Kasdan rose to fame as the screenwriter for two of Lucasfilm
Ltd.'s best films, "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) and "Raiders of
the Lost Ark" (1981). He is also the writer-director of "Body Heat"
and "The Big Chill." But for clues as to how he feels about Lucas,
look at Kasdan's 1999 movie "Mumford."</LD>
<LD>   The movie is a delightful comedy about a fellow from West Virginia
who picks a picture-book West Coast town in which to start a new life
as a psychologist. One of his clients is a billionaire who invented a
wildly successful modem.</LD>
<TE>   But our hero isn't in awe of his friend's wealth; he's in awe of
the way the man has turned Panda Modem headquarters into a
combination campus and personal playground. (Think Lucasfilm Ltd. and
Skywalker Ranch, Lucas' Northern California compound.)</TE>
<TE>   And he's so convinced of the tycoon's authentic goodness that he
supports his every whim.</TE>
<TE>   Kasdan may have the same affectionate appreciation of Lucas.
Working for Lucas three times--on "Empire," "Raiders" and the script
for "Return of the Jedi"--was "never anything but fun," Kasdan says.</TE>
<TE>   One of the qualities he values most in Lucas is his persistence in
going his own way, criticism be damned. It's not a question of
letting Lucas be Lucas, Kasdan says. It's a question of admiring
Lucas for what he wants to do and can do, rather than knocking him
for what he doesn't try to do.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Question: How did you become part of the "Star Wars" saga?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: For me, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" came first. Off an
outline that George, Steven [Spielberg] and I put together, I had
been working on "Raiders" for six months alone and came up to
George's office to give it to him in a very ceremonious way. He threw
it on the desk and asked me if I wanted to write "Empire." Leigh
Brackett, the original screenwriter, had died before he could even
discuss her first draft with her.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Because "The Empire Strikes Back" has become such a clear-cut
favorite among critics and fans, I've seen writers give Brackett
credit for its dark emotional crosscurrents and humor, because they
know Brackett wrote the scripts for "The Big Sleep" and "Rio Bravo."</TE>
<TE>   A: Look, there's no question that Leigh Brackett was one of the
great screenwriters of all time. But it was an odd job for her, and
there's nothing of that draft left in "Empire."</TE>
<TE>   Not to say it's all me. The truth is these movies are all George.
I wouldn't say that of "Raiders," but I would say that of the "Star
Wars" movies. He has the stories in mind and the difference in each
film is how they're executed.</TE>
<TE>   George had hired Leigh the way anyone would--because, oh my God,
she's Leigh Brackett, and because he wanted a Hawksian, goading humor
between Han Solo and Princess Leia. But Leigh couldn't serve George
the way he wanted to be served. Out of all our respect for her, she
was always going to get a credit for the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I'm intrigued that you think Lucas wanted a Hawksian feeling
out of "Big Sleep" or "Rio Bravo" in "Empire" and that's why he hired
Brackett; for years we've only thought of him in terms of heroic
archetypes out of Joseph Campbell--or comic books.</TE>
<TE>   A: It is a part of what he wanted, whether he could achieve it or
not. It was better achieved in "Raiders" [than in other
Lucas-produced or directed movies] and better in "Raiders" than in
other Spielberg-directed movies....</TE>
<TE>   When they went to cut "Raiders," they chopped out all sorts of
funny character stuff between Harrison Ford and Karen Allen--all of
it was sacrificed for speed and momentum, and that's more the case in
the "Star Wars" movies.</TE>
<TE>   Much as George has an interest in Hawksian flavor, I don't know
that he exercises it that much. Who knows--this new one is the first
that he's advertised as a flat-out romance. And now we're getting the
pure George. Of course, it was always really George--with everything
he does it's George.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Then why does he bring in other writers?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think he hates to write. In both "Empire" and "Jedi," I came
in as a fireman--with "Jedi" I had already done "Body Heat," so it
wasn't an obvious move for me to do another "Star Wars" movie. I just
liked working with George and wanted to help him out when he said he
was behind the eight ball. He knows there are certain things he wants
to get in and somehow curl a story around and it's not easy--that's
why he gets stuck. I saw him a couple of weeks before he left to
shoot "Phantom Menace" ... and the first remark he made to me was,
"Hey, do you want to write 'Phantom Menace'?" I asked, "Aren't you
starting to shoot it?" "Yeah," he said, "but it would be great if you
took a second pass at it." For George, the movie is bigger than the
script....</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't care about the relationships between people beyond the
broad strokes; he's not interested in the humor that can be wrung
from understanding the characters' eccentricities. If the humor isn't
there in the simple version of a scene he has to do, he's not
interested in it.... He's always filling out some large scheme, and
the people are there in his movies to represent different
philosophical [constructs].</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can you give me an example of a philosophical character?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yoda is one of the great creations. How many directors have
been interested in Zen masters over the years? Just think of Kurosawa
or Hawks or John Sturges. But George created this little creature who
did a lot of the same stuff as their heroes, and I wrote him good and
he was huge....</TE>
<TE>   A lot came together in "Empire." [Director Irvin Kershner's]
bleakness--and Frank Oz, who played Yoda [he was the puppeteer and
the voice], did great.</TE>
<TE>   So you had the introduction of this incredible character and it
really worked. But to me, the first "Star Wars" is the
mind-blower--it's like a Van Gogh or Monet or Picasso that takes
everything that came before and uses it in a new way. It was an
astounding movie that really blew everyone's mind. It took genius to
do that, I think. It was no accident.</TE>
<TE>   And to do it for $11 million....</TE>

<HD>ABC Reprises 'Mole II' for Summer</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>C'mon, you want to watch "The Mole," don't you? Won't you?</LD>
<LD>   Having benched the series after a mere trio of poorly rated
Friday-night outings last fall, ABC will revive "The Mole II: The
Next Betrayal" beginning tonight at 8, with the hope that enough
people will tune in to justify the summer run of the reality show.</LD>
<LD>   The gimmick of "The Mole" involves a group of contestants
undergoing a series of physical and mental challenges (though
probably none as difficult as putting together ABC's prime-time
lineup). One among the group is a mole, or saboteur, and the
contestants go about trying to identify him or her. At the end,
someone gets prize money.</LD>
<TE>   The series premiered in January 2001 as a "Survivor"-like gambit,
part of the same wave that brought "Temptation Island" to Fox and
"The Amazing Race" to CBS, among others. In its initial run on ABC,
"The Mole" boosted the network's ratings among younger viewers. But
"The Mole II" didn't fare as well when it returned to the schedule
last fall, a few weeks after Sept. 11. Now it's getting another
chance, with the network offering back-to-back episodes the first two
weeks, followed by previously unseen episodes at 9 p.m. in the weeks
to come.</TE>
<TE>   The host, by the way, remains Anderson Cooper, who completed
production on the series months ago and has since landed a job at CNN
as an anchor on "American Morning With Paula Zahn."</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Steps Up Talks to Raise Capital</HD>
<DH>Cable: The firm is negotiating deals to meet June 15 loan
deadline. Allen team inspects L.A. systems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp., racing to pay off loans due June 15,
is in heightened talks with several parties about deals that could
raise capital and prevent the cable company from filing for
bankruptcy protection, sources close to the situation said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street firms including Blackstone Group and Apollo Group have
proposed making an equity investment in the company of $1 billion or
more.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, billionaire-turned-cable-mogul Paul Allen had a team in
Los Angeles over the weekend assessing the condition of Adelphia's
cable systems here, laying the groundwork for a formal bid that could
be worth more than $1.5 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Sources said an asset sale may be more attractive to the company
because of the fire-sale value of Adelphia shares right now. Yet an
investment might be easier to pull off before the June 15 deadline
that Adelphia faces to pay certain loans that are already in default.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working around the clock to beat the June 15 deadline, when
the defaults must be remedied," said one source involved in the
discussions. "The chances of getting a deal done by then aren't great
because the company is so disorganized. Half of their executives have
resigned in the last week, so it's hard to have a constructive
discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's stock has plunged nearly 90% since disclosures in March
that the founding Rigas family had borrowed $2.3 billion using
questionable off-balance-sheet practices that leave the public
company liable. The stock closed Friday at $2.77, up 15 cents, on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The company is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and by attorneys general in Pennsylvania and New York.
Over the last week and a half, founder John Rigas and his three sons
who ran Adelphia have resigned from top management and from the
board.</TE>
<TE>   The company is being run by a committee of four outside directors,
led by interim Chief Executive Erland E. Kailbourne, who are
struggling to keep the company afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, weakened under a towering debt of more than $15 billion,
needs an estimated $3 billion to operate over the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia announced several weeks ago plans to sell systems,
including those in Los Angeles, that serve as many as 3 million cable
subscribers. The nation's sixth-largest cable operator, Adelphia has
a total of 6 million subscribers, mostly in the East.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a week, Adelphia has been in discussions with Allen,
who controls Charter Communications Corp., the nation's
fourth-largest cable operator, with about 8 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Allen proposes buying systems that serve 450,000 of Adelphia's 1.2
million customers in Southern California. Under the transaction,
Allen would have an option to purchase the remaining properties at a
future date.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking the deal into two parts would allow the parties to speed
the process by simplifying the deal. Adelphia owns the 450,000
subscribers outright but shares the others in a 75%-25% joint venture
with AT&amp;T Broadband. Despite its minority stake, AT&amp;T has the right
to approve any sale.</TE>
<TE>   Allen also is interested in buying Adelphia systems in Georgia
that are owned by the Rigas family.</TE>
<TE>   The joint venture properties, however, are the most desirable of
those up for sale. They are in some of Los Angeles' most affluent
neighborhoods, including Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, Bel-Air,
Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The 450,000 customers are mostly in outlying areas such as
Palmdale, Thousand Oaks, El Monte and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The initial sale probably would be valued at more than $1.5
billion, although Adelphia's asking price is closer to $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia has accumulated its 1.2 million Southern California
subscribers in 90 systems over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   About 800,000 of the subscribers came as a result of the October
1999 purchase of Century Communications Corp., the leading cable
provider in Los Angeles. Allen's Charter was the losing bidder for
Century.</TE>
<TE>   Allen is considered the front-runner this time around. Los Angeles
would give Charter big-city systems that are more economical to
operate than the small to mid-size properties that make up the
majority of Allen's holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Yet sources said chances are slim that the deal could be pulled
together by June 15.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from creditors, directors and shareholders, Tim
Rigas resigned as chief financial officer May 16, a day after his
father, John Rigas, who founded Adelphia in 1952, stepped down as
chairman, chief executive and president.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Partner Defends Memo About Documents</HD>
<DH>Courts: First defense witness denies firm's attorney
recommended destroying evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTEN HAYS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>An Arthur Andersen executive testified Monday that a much-publicized
memo concerning the disposal of Enron Corp. documents reflected good
housekeeping, rather than any desire to get rid of incriminating
evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Corgel, a Los Angeles-based partner responsible for
supervising Andersen's U.S. audits, said an Oct. 12 e-mail sent by
in-house attorney Nancy Temple was not, as prosecutors have alleged,
a tacit order to destroy documents.</LD>
<LD>   "Nancy Temple gave advice [in the fall] as to what we should be
retaining for purposes of documenting our conclusions," Corgel said,
adding that he never heard anyone give an order to destroy documents
and that he would have questioned such a command.</LD>
<TE>   Corgel was the first witness called by Andersen's lawyers as the
accounting firm began its defense against charges it obstructed
justice. The government contends the firm deliberately shredded
documents and deleted computer records related to its Enron audits
last year as the Securities and Exchange Commission began
investigating the collapsed energy company's finances.</TE>
<TE>   His testimony came on the same day that the prosecution rested its
case in the three-week trial. Andersen lawyer Rusty Hardin said he
would draw from a pool of 12 potential witnesses for the defense,
which he predicted would wrap up by the end of the week.</TE>
<TE>   The trial did not break for the Memorial Day holiday on order of
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, jurors heard from FBI agent Paula Schanzle,
the last of 19 prosecution witnesses, whose testimony had started
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Schanzle acknowledged under questioning by Hardin that she
personally examined "more than half" of the documents and the "vast
majority" of those "had something to do with Enron."</TE>
<TE>   She previously told a grand jury the vast majority of the total
were Enron-related, but she testified Monday she hadn't been talking
about the content of the e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Harmon denied the defense's routine request to
dismiss the case for lack of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   She said she would rule later on a request to quash mid-trial
prosecution subpoenas for information regarding possible spikes in
deletion of e-mails on certain days in October. Prosecutors also want
copies of actual work papers, or final documentation that accompanies
finished audits, to determine what was deemed necessary to keep.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers maintain the analysis of spikes in e-mail
deletions is unreliable because no one compared them with deletions
on other days throughout 2001. They also say prosecutors have had
access for months to 500 boxes of work papers under guard at
Andersen's Houston offices.</TE>

<HD>Expanding Its Territory</HD>
<DH>Jefferies Group is trying to create a brand name for itself
in investment banking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of George Pedersen's associates winced when he picked Jefferies
Group Inc. to handle his company's first stock offering.</LD>
<LD>   The financial services firm, founded in Los Angeles 40 years ago
and best known for its institutional trading prowess, isn't
considered in the big leagues of Wall Street capital raisers,
especially for initial public stock offerings.</LD>
<LD>   But Jefferies helped Pedersen's ManTech International Corp., a
Fairfax, Va.-based defense contractor, attract enough large investors
that ManTech raised more cash than expected, Pedersen said. The
firm's stock has gained more than 30% since its February offering,
making it one of the better-performing IPOs this year.</LD>
<TE>   "With Jefferies, we met the top people and got access to some
incredible institutional investors," said Pedersen, ManTech's chief
executive. "I'd tell any CEO to hire them for an IPO."</TE>
<TE>   Jefferies, which this year completed a hand-over of top
management's reins from longtime CEO Frank Baxter to 40-year-old
Richard B. Handler, wants to create a brand name for itself as a
premier full-service investment bank for mid-size companies, Handler
said.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter started the firm down that road in the mid-1990s, seeking
to diversify the business from its roots as a trader of large blocks
of stock for big investors.</TE>
<TE>   Now, under Handler, Jefferies lists its headquarters as New York
rather than Los Angeles. That shift, which was simply noted in one of
the company's financial statements this year, didn't involve moving
jobs or offices, the firm said. About half of the company's 1,200
employees work in the New York area, compared with about 200 in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted to reflect the reality of where management is now
based," said Handler, who lives in New York. John C. Shaw, 55, the
firm's president and chief operating officer, lives in Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   But Handler concedes that there's an issue of image as well. The
new Madison Avenue headquarters designation "reflects our growth from
a regional boutique to a company with a $1-billion market
[capitalization]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Firm Is Expanding as Others Shrink</TE>
<TE>   Despite the stock market's continuing struggles, Jefferies posted
record earnings of $17.7 million, or 65 cents a share, in the first
quarter, a 13% gain from a year earlier, at a time when many of Wall
Street's financial giants have faced declining profits and layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Stock and bond underwriting deals, corporate restructuring work
and other financial services for companies helped drive Jefferies'
revenue from corporate finance to $37.7 million in the quarter, more
than double the unit's results a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "Their numbers were so good, it shocked me a little," said Chris
J. Allen, an analyst with Putnam Lovell Securities who follows
Jefferies. The firm's shares, at $49 now on the New York Stock
Exchange, are up 16% this year, while most brokerage stocks have
slumped.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most of Wall Street, Jefferies said it's hiring staff,
including investment bankers to focus on specific industry sectors
such as health care. Handler said Jefferies aims to fill the void he
believes was left when independent mid-tier investment banking firms
such as Montgomery Securities were swallowed up by large commercial
banks in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at all these acquisitions that have come and gone. All
these great franchises are basically blown up. All the [acquirers]
are having trouble digesting them, and all the people there are
either out of jobs or are unhappy," Handler said.</TE>
<TE>   For the same reason, he said Jefferies isn't interested in being
bought, despite rumors over the last year that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
Charles Schwab Corp. and other firms might consider a bid. Jefferies'
employee stock ownership plan holds 15.2% of the company's shares, as
of the latest proxy statement, and executive officers and directors
hold 12.6%.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we keep delivering shareholder value, why join that
mess?" Handler said about the idea of selling out.</TE>
<TE>   With its push deeper into corporate finance, Jefferies now has 113
investment bankers and 45 analysts, up from 77 bankers and 24
analysts at the end of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   However, industry experts say the jury is still out on whether
Jefferies has the muscle to create a banking brand name with the
cachet of, say, a Hambrecht &amp; Quist, the San Francisco firm that
helped finance many of Silicon Valley's tech giants in their early
days.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a good firm, but the real question is what have they
done in terms of deals," said David Menlow, president of IPO
Financial.com, a data firm in New Jersey. "They are not a well-known
name" in underwriting.</TE>
<TE>   Since January 2001 Jefferies has led three initial public stock
offerings and three secondary stock offerings, raising about $405
million in all, according to Thomson Financial/Securities Data.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also has handled debt financing deals such as a
$162-million senior note financing for American Restaurant Group, and
has a growing team devoted to corporate restructuring work.</TE>
<TE>   One of Jefferies' recent IPOs shows the dangers of competing in
that market: The firm underwrote an IPO in November for San
Jose-based software firm Bam Entertainment. The IPO was priced at $8
a share; the stock is now at $2.80 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "The deal was very well received, but we were very disappointed by
the [financial] results the company later put out," Handler said. "It
happens. We tried everything to be supportive of the stock."</TE>
<TE>   Investment Banking Is About Bottom Line</TE>
<TE>   Jefferies isn't the first investment bank to stress the idea of
catering to mid-size companies. Analysts say the concept is no
slam-dunk.</TE>
<TE>   Handler said his strategy to gain banking business includes
offering a full range of services to mid-size firms. One approach
Jefferies has used is buying smaller investment research firms and
hiring bankers who understand specific industries.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferies last year took an ownership stake in Quarterdeck
Investment Partners, a Los Angeles-based defense-industry-focused
boutique investment bank. The move helped Jefferies gain access to
more defense-related firms, such as ManTech, Handler said.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on investment banking is a bottom-line issue,
analysts say: Underwriting, merger advisory and other banking
services can provide far richer fees than what Jefferies earns
trading stocks and bonds for big clients.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Jefferies remains a powerhouse in the trading arena.
Trading accounted for the bulk of the company's $195 million in
first-quarter revenue. Last year, the firm executed nearly 10% of all
trades on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferies last year bought Lawrence Helfant, a NYSE floor broker.
That deal merged Helfant with Jefferies subsidiary W&amp;D Securities and
created the largest independent NYSE floor broker. Because floor
brokers are physically in one place, they often see both buyers and
sellers and know the history of trading in a stock, Handler said.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives the best execution and color for our clients," Handler
said. "By having a strong presence on the floor, you can have a
better feel for what the other trading firms are doing and relay that
color to a Jefferies salesman," who can then tell the client.</TE>
<TE>   Of Jefferies' 1,200 total employees, about 50% are directly tied
to the trading business.</TE>
<TE>   The company remains a major name in block trades. Founded by Boyd
Jefferies in 1962 while he was a trader at the Pacific Stock
Exchange, the firm built its reputation as a brokerage that could
quietly bring together buyers and sellers of big chunks of stock.
Institutions looking to buy or sell big blocks prize traders who can
arrange a transaction without the information getting into the market
prematurely and affecting the price.</TE>
<TE>   "The backbone of our firm has and always will be our trading
platform," Handler said. "But we're trying to leverage our buy-side
relationships to be a good banker" as well.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter, who began with the company in 1974, had run the brokerage
from L.A. since 1987, when the firm suffered a major blow: Boyd
Jefferies' guilty plea on inside-trading charges related to the Ivan
Boesky scandal of that era.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter guided the company out of the 1980s and through the 1990s,
building up its trading operations and making the initial foray into
investment banking.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Jefferies completed the top-management changes begun
two years ago. Handler and Shaw were named co-presidents in 2000.
Handler then was named chief executive in January 2001, and Baxter
remained chairman.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Handler took on the additional title of chairman from
Baxter, 65, who now is chairman emeritus and will continue to consult
with the firm while working on various charity and civic projects. He
also is the finance committee chair for Bill Simon's California
gubernatorial campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Handler was hired by Baxter from the now-defunct Drexel Burnham
Lambert in the late 1980s. At 40, he is young for a CEO and is known
as an aggressive manager who still likes to sit on the trading desk.
He formerly ran Jefferies' fixed-income division.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter said he believes that, though the company isn't officially
based in L.A. anymore, Jefferies still has a "California attitude"
characterized by "challenging the status quo. That goes back to the
1960s."</TE>
<TE>   Handler said he's counting on that spirit to drive the company's
growth as it targets mid-size companies for corporate finance and
other services.</TE>
<TE>   "So many of our competitors are part of large bureaucracies now,
where it's hard to get a decision made and very hard to focus on
smaller" companies, Handler said. "We're a very entrepreneurial firm.
We are very lean, and we've got the whole mid-cap area available to
us right now."</TE>

<DH>A cancer survivor hopes to make a living investing in real
estate. But debt could sink him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE LOSEE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bryan Oakley quit his job to spend his days doing something he loves,
and for good reason. As a cancer survivor, Oakley is a little more
aware of his mortality than the average 36-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   "I received last rites three times while I was sick," Oakley said.
"I have been working very hard, saving and investing, with the
expectation that I will not have to work so hard in the future."</LD>
<LD>   In January, Oakley left his job at the Sanitation Districts of Los
Angeles County, where he was a civil engineer making $90,000 a year
building treatment plants and sewer systems. He now hopes to make a
living doing what he truly enjoys: investing in real estate.</LD>
<TE>   Oakley is off to a promising start. Since first teaming up at age
21 with his mother to buy a duplex in Hawthorne, he has acquired
stakes in dozens of rental units in Arizona and the Los Angeles area
that pay him $4,000 a month after expenses. He figures he can add to
that rental income by selling real estate and substitute-teaching
high school science classes if need be.</TE>
<TE>   But do the numbers add up?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, said Nancy Langdon Jones, a certified financial planner in
Upland. But she said Oakley faces some major financial challenges,
including paring an unusually large debt load and finding
professional advice. Another challenge: following the advice, once he
gets it, to avoid the type of mistake that can easily sink a lone
real estate investor in today's volatile market.</TE>
<TE>   How Oakley got to this point is the stuff of a TV movie. His
parents divorced when he was 7, and his mother spent the next 10
years working as a grocery store checker and bookkeeper. The family
lived paycheck to paycheck while Oakley's mother scraped together
enough money to send her children to parochial school.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it was Oakley's mother who set the example he would later
follow of parlaying a small bit of cash into real estate. By the time
her son was 17, she owned the family's home, and four years later
mother and son were landlords. But not before Oakley was diagnosed
with testicular cancer during his freshman year at Loyola Marymount
University.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Oakley battle his way through three operations and a
full course of chemotherapy while working his way through college,
but he also went on to get a graduate degree in engineering from UC
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Oakley earned the money for his half of the $20,000
down payment on the Hawthorne duplex as a supervisor of 15 newspaper
carriers at the Daily Breeze in Torrance, where he was a top salesman
who regularly won lucrative subscription-selling contests.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley acquired building No. 2 before starting graduate school. He
got his real estate license in 1995 and has used the savings from his
civil engineer's salary to invest in rental buildings with his mother
and with a college friend, who remains a partner in several
properties.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis of how his portfolio of 64 rental units yields just
$4,000 a month in income demonstrates how difficult it is to make a
living as a landlord.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that most of Oakley's units were acquired with partners
accounts for the biggest cut of the take. And the units don't
generate especially high rents, because they are in lower-income
areas. Vacancies eat into profit from time to time, and six of
Oakley's units are losing money or barely breaking even. The value of
the buildings has appreciated, so those rentals will end up being a
good investment for him in the long run, but they don't enhance his
monthly bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   So how does Oakley make sure his transition from a dependable
government paycheck to the uncertain world of real estate doesn't
wreck him financially?</TE>
<TE>   The first priority, Jones said, is for Oakley to get a handle on
his debt.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a car loan and the mortgages on his properties,
Oakley owes a whopping $72,000 from credit card debt, a stock margin
account and a home equity line of credit. Much of it is carefully
calculated leverage--he used the home equity line of credit on one
condo, for example, to raise cash for a down payment on another
property that was rising in value.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say enough how impressed I am with Bryan's logic on these
things," the planner said. But she was less impressed by the $21,000
in credit card debt.</TE>
<TE>   Half of that represents the down payment on a new, electric-blue
Corvette--the kind of line item that drives financial planners crazy.
But Oakley is unapologetic.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I drive it, I'm happy," he said. "I'm not a person who
usually charges up a credit card like that, but at this stage I
thought I could afford it."</TE>
<TE>   So the car stays. Jones also recommended that Oakley stop buying
stocks on margin, and he's in no position to disagree because he has
found little success as a stock investor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like leveraging money to buy real estate," the planner
said. "It's just debt hanging over your head."</TE>
<TE>   But Oakley prefers to leave the credit card and the stock margin
accounts as they are. Instead of paying down debt, he wants to raise
cash to buy more real estate.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, he has just cleared nearly $50,000 by selling his
home in Lomita, and he's considering using the cash to buy another
condo in one of the buildings in which he's already invested.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley is even thinking about liquidating his retirement accounts:
$67,000 with the California Public Employees' Retirement System and
about $48,000 in a 457 tax-deferred retirement plan. But Jones warned
Oakley about the penalties he might incur by withdrawing the money
early.</TE>
<TE>   "I recommend rolling the money over into an IRA so you can choose
whatever you want to invest in," she said. "You have so much real
estate that the retirement account offers you some diversification."</TE>
<TE>   The two compromised--Oakley agreed to roll over the CalPERS
account and liquidate the 457 plan, which he will use to invest in
properties in Phoenix and Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said Oakley's next priority is to hire a lawyer and other
professionals to help protect his interests as he begins to depend
almost exclusively on his rental income.</TE>
<TE>   And if Oakley were to get married, Jones said, he should have his
attorney draw up a prenuptial agreement to protect the assets he
acquired before the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley also needs a financial planner and a banker who can help
manage the mortgage loans for his properties. But Oakley would rather
trust his own judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the business that I've been able to make money in," he
said. "I haven't always made the right steps, but I've made quite a
few good ones."</TE>

<DH>Real estate: City cuts rates to draw business to
money-losing garage at Hollywood &amp; Highland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood has a costly flop on its hands, but it's not a movie. It's
a 3,000-space parking garage.</LD>
<LD>   With demand and revenue falling far below expectations, the
behemoth garage underneath the new Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping
center is costing its owner, the city of Los Angeles, an average of
$500,000 a month to cover the shortfall and is gobbling up cash set
aside to build public parking facilities in other parts of the city.</LD>
<LD>   A recent cut in the parking rate designed to draw more business to
the struggling mall and its garage was hailed by Hollywood advocates
eager to see the landmark project stabilize. But city officials
concede they don't know whether the strategy will pay off.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the parking lot that could eat all the other new parking
lots in the city of Los Angeles," Councilman Jack Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Public garages are considered an essential element in reviving
urban areas but are viewed as a risky investment by private real
estate developers, who often turn to government to help finance
garage construction.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Pasadena, for example, built three parking garages to
help spur development of its popular Old Pasadena district. Los
Angeles' redevelopment agency financed the 1,700-space garage at the
new Cinerama Dome theater and retail project in Hollywood. Without
government participation "there would be no project," Cinerama Dome
site developer Neil Haltrecht said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its deal with Hollywood &amp; Highland developer Trizec
Properties Inc. (formerly Trizec-Hahn), the city agreed to build a
giant public parking garage underneath the redevelopment project,
which includes 500,000 square feet of retail space, a hotel and the
Kodak Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The six-level, approximately $80-million garage--by far the city's
most expensive--was financed by bonds to be paid off with garage
income. For the first time, the city pledged its Special Parking
Revenue Fund--which pays for parking lot and garage maintenance and
construction--to cover any shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of operating as planned at a modest deficit, before
breaking even in 2004, the Hollywood &amp; Highland garage was in trouble
soon after it opened in November. Average revenue has been about 50%
below projections. The number of cars parked each month has averaged
about 76,000, well below what is needed to break even.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the public garage underneath Pasadena's recently
opened Paseo Colorado mall, also developed by Trizec Properties, has
been drawing about 25,000 cars each weekend, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Trizec executives and L.A. city officials said the shortfall is
primarily the result of a sharp drop in foreign tourism after last
year's terrorist attacks along with parking rates set too high for
the tolerance of local shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   "Without affordable parking, it won't work," said Lee Wagman,
president of Trizec's retail and entertainment properties division.
"Why would [residents] come here to pay $10 when they can go
someplace else to pay $2?"</TE>
<TE>   But many parking specialists say rates are often unfairly blamed
for a property's other shortcomings. Critics have faulted Hollywood &amp;
Highland, for example, for its confusing layout as well as a limited
number and selection of stores.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have things that will attract [customers] to the
site, then lowering the parking rates won't solve the problem,"
Councilman Dennis Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   The city this month approved a new reduced rate plan that offers
four hours of validated parking for $2. The validation was expanded
to apply to nearly all area merchants, not just those at Hollywood &amp;
Highland.</TE>
<TE>   "We're absolutely sure that the new rate structure will be a boon
to the tenants that rely on local business," Wagman said. "The
[parking] revenue will increase, not decrease, from this."</TE>
<TE>   However, some parking experts said they doubt the city can
generate enough revenue to cover its costs through cheaper rates and
expanded validation. The strategy could backfire, they said, clogging
the garage with $2 parkers and attracting visitors who normally would
have parked in privately owned lots and garages.</TE>
<TE>   "You are giving away too much time," said Janice Rhodes, parking
manager for the city of Pasadena, who has worked in the industry for
25 years. "With that kind of rate structure in place ... you're not
going to generate enough revenues."</TE>
<TE>   City leaders said they had no choice but to take a chance with the
rate cut.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of merchants were saying they were hurt; a lot of people
were saying the parking was too much," Hollywood area Councilman Eric
Garcetti said. "It was important to create a different kind of buzz
with $2 parking."</TE>
<TE>   Before the rates were cut, the Hollywood &amp; Highland garage was
projected to lose more than $4 million annually, forcing the city to
chop funds earmarked for new parking construction by 25%. The
potential effect on proposed parking projects in Chinatown, downtown
Los Angeles and Studio City might set back urban renewal efforts, a
real estate specialist said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you impair the development of other [parking] projects, you
could be impairing the improvement and revitalization of some other
important neighborhoods," Los Angeles consultant Larry Kosmont said.</TE>
<TE>   The city could have avoided raiding its parking fund if the
Hollywood &amp; Highland garage had been financed and owned by its
Community Redevelopment Agency. The bonds to finance the Cinerama
Dome parking garage, for instance, are backed by property tax revenue
generated by improvements in the agency's project area in addition to
a multimillion-dollar letter of credit issued by the developer,
Robertson Properties.</TE>
<TE>   City officials could not explain why the city--not the
agency--ended up with ownership and financial responsibility for the
Hollywood &amp; Highland garage. "Nobody here now was part of the
negotiations," said John McCoy, who heads the agency's Hollywood
redevelopment efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment agency might be asked at some point to help bail
out the garage if the parking-rate cut does not work, city officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks after the rates were cut, it's too early to say what
the effect has been, city transportation engineer and parking
specialist Alan Willis said. Trizec has just begun to promote the
cheaper rates and to distribute validation stamps to area merchants.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors who parked there one recent weekday seemed split on the
benefits of the rate change. Hollywood business owner Arnold
Castaneda decided to visit the mall for the first time after hearing
the rates had been cut.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have come here for $10," said Castaneda, 36, a bail
bondsman. But 21-year-old Glendale resident Heripsime Assadourian,
who already had visited the mall several times to shop and eat, said
the bargain rates wouldn't make her visit more often.</TE>
<TE>   "The mall itself doesn't really interest me," Assadourian said.
"There are better malls elsewhere."</TE>

<HD>Key Drug Patent Ruling Nears</HD>
<DH>Courts: Effort to block generic versions of Prilosec could
set trend in the industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the next few days, a federal judge in New York is expected to rule
on the biggest drug patent case in history, one with enormous
significance for consumers and drug manufacturers.</LD>
<LD>   The fight over Prilosec, a heartburn drug that accounted for $3.7
billion in U.S. sales last year and was once the world's best-selling
medication, pits Europe's No.2 drug maker, AstraZeneca, against four
generic competitors. At issue is whether AstraZeneca can extend its
patent on Prilosec, which expired in October, for several more years,
thereby keeping cheaper alternatives off the market.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones' ruling comes at a time of
unprecedented challenge in the pharmaceutical industry. The patents
for 18 major brand-name drugs will expire in the next five years,
potentially opening up $23.3 billion in annual sales to lower-priced
competition. Half of those drugs, like Prilosec, are in the
blockbuster category of a billion dollars and above in annual sales.</LD>
<TE>   If AstraZeneca's strategy for extending its patent on Prilosec
succeeds, analysts say that will embolden other giants of the
brand-name drug industry to follow suit. If AstraZeneca fails, it
could be a boon for consumers--and for generic drug makers. Barr
Laboratories gained $365 million in sales in just six months last
year from its generic version of Prozac after Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s
antidepressant went off patent.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca's effort to extend its patent for Prilosec has become
a bellwether of outrage over the cost of prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., a member of the recently formed Business for
Affordable Medicine coalition, said it spends $1 million a day on
Prilosec for its employees. BAM claims that it will bring the clout
of the nation's largest businesses to bear on an effort to get
generic drugs to market faster.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca was cited by the California State Employees Assn. as
an example of how far brand-name drug companies will go to preserve a
"competition-free climate" for their best-selling medications.
Eighteen state governors wrote the Food and Drug Administration last
year, urging the quick approval of a lower-priced version of
Prilosec, which costs about $130 for a month's supply. In Congress,
the Prilosec case is used by critics to point out that the 1984 law
governing generic competition is slanted in favor of brand-name
companies and ought to be amended.</TE>
<TE>   Few companies have launched a coordinated, global assault on the
scale of AstraZeneca. It has sued 10 potential generic competitors of
Prilosec, saying their copies of the medicine violate patents on the
drug that are still valid. The main patent on Prilosec expired in
October, but the company's federal court case against Andrx Corp.,
Merck KGaA, Schwarz Pharma  and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. argues
that five other Prilosec patents are equally valid.</TE>
<TE>   Three of those patents deal with the formulation of the pill and
with its coating, which AstraZeneca claims is a unique three-layer
barrier that protects the drug from stomach acids. If successful with
its arguments that one or more of the patents is essential to the
drug's manufacture--and would represent an infringement on its rights
should generic companies use them--AstraZeneca could retain exclusive
rights to the drug's sales through 2007 or even 2014.</TE>
<TE>   On a parallel track, the company is pursuing an aggressive
direct-to-consumer marketing strategy to switch current Prilosec
users over to its next-generation anti-heartburn, anti-ulcer, acid
reflux drug, Nexium. Both are based on the ingredient omeprazole.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie B. Haber, analyst with New Vernon Associates, said the
strategy to convert patients to Nexium is working, even though "we
don't feel that it is materially different from Prilosec. Nexium
already has gained 20% of Prilosec's market share in terms of new
prescriptions." Other analysts and experts say that 80% of today's
Prilosec users do not need to switch to Nexium.</TE>
<TE>   A research report released today by the National Institute for
Health Care Management said that producing slightly different
versions of existing drugs to protect market share is a common tactic
among major pharmaceutical companies.</TE>
<TE>   The report found that two-thirds of the prescription drugs
approved by the FDA between 1989 and 2000 were modified versions of
existing medicines or identical to drugs already on the market; only
about one-third were drugs based on new molecules that treat diseases
in novel ways. And only 15% of drugs approved during the period used
new chemical compounds as their active ingredients and were deemed by
the FDA to provide significant improvement over existing medicines,
the study said.</TE>
<TE>   Drug makers face the difficult choice of breaking new scientific
ground on a completely new drug or choosing the easier route of
"modifying an older drug [that] enables a brand drug company to
extend its intellectual property protection on the product. Such
extensions, in turn, enable a brand company to delay generic
competitors and maintain a high price for an aging product," the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the Prilosec patent case weighs most heavily on
Andrx and GenPharm, the two companies that share the lucrative first
rights to market the generic equivalent to Prilosec for six months
before other competitors can step into the market. Although those
companies already have gained FDA approval to begin production of the
generic version, doing so presents a huge financial risk to both
companies.</TE>
<TE>   If Andrx and GenPharm begin to sell the drug and lose the court
case, either outright or on appeal, they will be liable not only for
the sales they have accrued but also for substantial penalties for
patent infringement. That's why neither company has budged and is
awaiting the outcome of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca's strategy is almost bulletproof, financial analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a win-win for AstraZeneca," said Todd Lebor, an analyst for
Morningstar. "Every day that AstraZeneca delays generic competition
with this case is another day in which they take in $12 million more
in sales of Prilosec."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Elliot Hahn, chief executive of Andrx, whose company could
split an estimated $1 billion in generic Prilosec sales in just six
months, said AstraZeneca "has raised delay tactics to an art form."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Coyne, senior manager for public affairs for AstraZeneca's
gastrointestinal group, denied that the court case is a stalling
tactic designed to give the company more time to switch to Nexium.
"Prilosec is a complex product. The formulation and the coating that
allows this drug to be absorbed by the body deserves patent
protection," Coyne said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gregory Glover, a partner at Boston law firm Ropes &amp; Gray and
outside counsel to the pharmaceutical industry on intellectual
property matters, said companies such as AstraZeneca, in aggressively
protecting their patents, are only doing what's necessary to ensure
that there is sufficient money for future research.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount of money spent on research and development by the
brand-name pharmaceutical industry [more than $31 billion in 2001]
shows that the science of developing these drugs is getting harder,"
Glover said.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Reforms Backing Grows</HD>
<DH>Latin America: President gets his party's governors and
legislators to pledge to adhere to the terms demanded by the IMF.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SANTA ROSA, Argentina</DL>
<LD>Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde said Monday that provincial
governors and legislators from his Peronist Party agreed to comply
with conditions of International Monetary Fund aid within a week.</LD>
<LD>   Duhalde announced the promise after meeting Peronist leaders in
the central province of La Pampa. Duhalde threatened to resign last
week after governors and Congress failed to act on a similar pledge
made a month ago.</LD>
<LD>   "Time has run out," Duhalde said in a speech from La Pampa, where
he was flanked by governors and Juan Carlos Maqueda, president of the
Senate. "We've decided that this week we will carry out the
objectives we have set."</LD>
<TE>   Duhalde has struggled to persuade provinces to cut spending and
Congress to alter laws as demanded by the IMF after the country
defaulted and devalued. The government is betting an IMF agreement
will free up financing for exports and help end a recession that's
increased unemployment to 25% and left more than 40% of the
population in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF, which cut off financing in December, has told Duhalde to
get all 23 provinces to commit to reducing deficits by 60%. So far,
seven have signed agreements.</TE>
<TE>   "The IMF needs a plan that looks sustainable while governors face
political constraints," said Freddy Thomsen, senior economist for ING
Bank Argentina. "Governors will probably sign knowing they will never
meet the targets if the recession continues."</TE>
<TE>   Buenos Aires, the country's biggest province, said it is
negotiating with the economy ministry and IMF officials to reduce its
deficit by less than 60%.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll only sign if I get financing from the government," said
Buenos Aires Gov. Felipe Sola.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde persuaded Peronist senators to strike down today a
so-called economic subversion law that judges have used to prosecute
bankers.</TE>
<TE>   Congress appointed Duhalde to the presidency five months ago after
food riots and a freeze on bank accounts toppled former President
Fernando de la Rua.</TE>

<HD>Carnival's Cunard Isn't for Sale</HD>
<DH>Leisure: The cruise operator is not willing to sell the
line to clear regulatory issues for its P&amp;O Princess bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Carnival Corp., the world's biggest cruise operator, said Monday that
selling the Cunard line, with the QE2, was too high a price to pay
for regulatory clearance of its $6.7-billion bid for P&amp;O Princess
Cruises.</LD>
<LD>   But the U.S. group said it would be willing to get rid of British
operator P&amp;O Cruises-UK in an effort to win over European Union
officials opposed to the deal, which is aimed at securing Carnival's
market leadership and driving down costs.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact they are saying they are prepared to look at selling P&amp;O
Cruises-UK shows how committed they are," said Simon Champion, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank.</LD>
<TE>   Carnival launched its hostile offer for P&amp;O Princess last year in
an attempt to thwart a previously agreed to merger between Royal
Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and P&amp;O Princess, the world's No. 2 and No.3
cruise operators.</TE>
<TE>   P&amp;O Princess shareholders have decided to put the Royal Caribbean
deal on hold to give regulators time to look at both bids.</TE>
<TE>   Sources told Reuters last week that the European Commission has
raised objections to Carnival's bid, triggering talk that it might be
forced to sell luxury line Cunard.</TE>
<TE>   "Should Carnival be required to divest assets in Europe as a
condition of regulatory clearance for its proposed bid to acquire P&amp;O
Princess, Carnival would not consider disposing of Cunard Line,"
Carnival said.</TE>
<TE>   The bid battle began late last year when the world's three largest
cruise operators were forced to look for cost-cutting alliances to
help cope with a sharp fall in tourism after the Sept. 11 attacks on
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of its commitment to Cunard, Carnival is investing $1.2
billion in building new ships for the line, including the world's
biggest passenger ship Queen Mary 2.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival said it would be prepared to sacrifice P&amp;O Cruises-UK,
"should it ultimately prove necessary" to get clearance. P&amp;O
Cruises-UK operates four ships in the British cruise market,
competing with Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts and investors said all along that regulators would
have objections to both mergers, particularly any deal involving
Carnival with a North American market share of more than 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Alongside the European Commission probe, Britain is conducting its
own review of the Royal Caribbean/P&amp;O Princess deal. A decision is
due within the next month.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival said it was "fully dedicated" to getting regulatory
clearance for its bid, which has been bitterly opposed by P&amp;O
Princess' management. Its executives continue to back Royal
Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   P&amp;O Princess shareholders rebelled in February by voting to
adjourn a meeting to approve the Royal Caribbean deal in order to
give regulators more time to examine the competing offers.</TE>
<TE>   No cash or shares would change hands under the Royal Caribbean
merger, and both companies would retain separate listings. Princess
shareholders would own 50.7% of the enlarged group, which would have
Royal Caribbean Chief Executive Richard Fain as its new chief
executive.</TE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AIDS Healthcare Foundation, one of the largest providers of
specialized care for HIV patients in the United States, said it will
bar GlaxoSmithKline from marketing drugs at its outpatient sites to
protest the company's pricing policies.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Britain-based company offers reduced prices for AIDS
drugs sold in the developing world, the foundation claims the drug
manufacturer still charges twice as much as its competitors--an
allegation GlaxoSmithKline counters by saying it makes no profit on
those sales.</LD>
<LD>   By barring GlaxoSmithKline sales representatives from its
physicians' offices, the foundation hopes to block the main channel
the company uses to inform doctors directly about new products.</LD>
<TE>   "Glaxo's actions have put it outside the bounds of corporate
responsibility," said Michael Weinstein, president of the foundation
that serves thousands of patients in California, New York and
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Many pharmaceutical companies discount drugs in the developing
world, and GlaxoSmithKline acknowledges that some generic AIDS drugs
sell in the developing world for half the price of its comparable
products.</TE>
<TE>   But the company said it has reduced prices by as much as 90% and
does not make money on AIDS medications it sells to the developing
world.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to cover your basic costs of manufacturing," spokeswoman
Nancy Pekarek said. "You can't just give it away for the long term.
You have to ensure there's going to be a stable supply."</TE>
<TE>   Pekarek said she did not expect the foundation's move to have any
effect on the company's sales force.</TE>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline charges $2 for a day's supply of Combivir tablets,
a combination of the drugs AZT and 3TC. A generic version costs about
$1. In the United States, the list price for Combivir is $17.23 a
day, Pekarek said.</TE>

<HD>Firms Say Their Drug Outlasts Viagra</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: A study funded by Eli Lilly and Icos says
Cialis helps 59% of patients after 36 hours.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A yet-to-be-approved impotence drug developed by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and
Icos Corp. appears to be longer-lasting than Viagra, the companies
said, citing a study released at a medical conference Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Patients in the study reported success in achieving erections over
24 to 36 hours after taking a 20-milligram pill of Cialis, said
Indianapolis-based Lilly and Bothell, Wash.-based Icos on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The study did not compare Cialis' effects directly with those of
Viagra, the $1.2 billion-a-year drug for erectile dysfunction Pfizer
Inc. introduced in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "There are other studies that have looked at the length of the
duration of Viagra's effects, and usually it's in the
eight-to-12-hour range maximum," Dr. Raymond Rosen, the author of the
Cialis study, said in a phone interview.</TE>
<TE>   Results of the peer-reviewed, final-phase study were released at
the American Urological Assn. conference in Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The study, funded by Lilly and Icos, involved 348 men with mild to
severe erectile dysfunction who were given either a placebo or Cialis
over eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Patients were asked to attempt intercourse with their partners on
two occasions 24 hours after taking a dose and on two occasions after
36 hours.</TE>
<TE>   About 59% of the patients reported positive effects in their
ability to have sex after 36 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Cialis "showed a consistent effect at both time points," said
Rosen, a human sexuality researcher at the University of Medicine and
Dentistry of New Jersey and a psychologist. "Also, in this study, the
duration of effectiveness did not appear to influence the incidence
or severity or side effects."</TE>
<TE>   The most commonly reported side effects include headaches and
upset stomachs, with less than 2% of patients dropping out of the
study because of side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gerald Brock, an associate professor of urology at the
University of West Ontario, said the findings that Cialis' effects
are longer-lasting than Viagra's are significant because many
patients report that the window during which Viagra is effective
hinders their sex life.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly and Icos had hoped to win marketing approval this year. But
that has been pushed back to next year after the Food and Drug
Administration last month said it would require additional studies
before deciding on approval.</TE>

<HD>Hotels May Avert Strike</HD>
<DH>Labor: Unions agree to tentative deals with Las Vegas' MGM
Mirage and Mandalay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Unions representing culinary workers and bartenders agreed to a
five-year deal Monday with hotel-casino giant MGM Mirage Inc.,
probably averting a strike on the Strip.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement reached early Monday means that about 35,000 of the
47,000 workers represented by Culinary Local 226 and Bartenders Local
165 have tentative deals with the Las Vegas hotels, said John
Wilhelm, chief union negotiator.</LD>
<LD>   A strike Saturday is still a possibility, pending the results of
negotiations with the owners of smaller Strip and downtown Las Vegas
properties. However, "it would appear that we've averted a citywide
strike," said Mike Sloan, senior vice president of Mandalay Resort
Group. His company reached agreement with the unions Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The union had reached agreements Thursday with Park Place
Entertainment Corp., Harrah's Entertainment Inc. and the Tropicana.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased to have good contract settlements with all
four of the largest companies, plus the Tropicana," Wilhelm said.
Ratification votes have not been scheduled, he said, but should come
within the next two weeks. If the votes are scheduled after the
Friday settlement deadline and Saturday strike date, possible job
action would be postponed, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The five contracts have provisions specific to individual
properties. However, each calls for $3.23-an-hour increases in wages
and benefits over the life of the contracts. Wilhelm said current
wages and benefits average $14.17 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The contracts call for the companies to continue paying health
benefits, and promise housekeepers better working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Talks are continuing with hotel-casino owner Boyd Gaming Corp. and
14 other properties on the Strip and downtown, Wilhelm said.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Feldman, spokesman for MGM Mirage, said executives at the
Strip's largest employer "never had any doubt that we would reach
agreement."</TE>
<TE>   "Our employees are far too valuable to us," Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan called the deal the most expensive the industry has had with
the culinary union in Las Vegas--notable as the tourism-dependent
city continues to recover from a tourism slump after the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's a contract we can live with," Sloan said.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman called it likely that other hotel-casino companies would
follow suit, but said it wasn't clear if some smaller downtown Las
Vegas properties could afford similar contracts. The union chief and
both casino executives called ratification by union rank-and-file
likely because member committees have unanimously endorsed each deal.</TE>

<HD>Uneven Session for World Markets</HD>
<DH>Indexes: Hong Kong shares dip, and Europe frets over
telecom sector on U.S. holiday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It was a mixed session for international markets Monday as Asian
stocks struggled and European issues managed some gains.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. markets were closed in observance of the Memorial Day
holiday, prompting many investors to take the day off and wait to see
how U.S. stocks fared before making big moves.</LD>
<LD>   In Asia, Tokyo's benchmark stock index was essentially unchanged,
rising 0.07 of a point to 11,976.35. The flat performance came on
profit taking and a late-afternoon sell-off in technology issues,
including Sony.</LD>
<TE>   Hong Kong stocks closed lower in light trading Monday. The key
Hang Seng index dropped 62.05 points, or 0.5%, to 11,564.73.</TE>
<TE>   European markets were uneven, with sentiment about the
telecommunications sector alternately helping and depressing the
indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's DAX index gained a solid 62.41 points, or 1.3%, to
4,961.54, aided by strong gains in Deutsche Telekom. The firm's
annual general meeting is scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   In France, concern about another telecom company's performance
dampened but failed to halt the CAC-40 index, which rose 23.28
points, or 0.5%, to 4,360.71. Investors were closely watching France
Telecom to see what the company would say at its annual meeting
today. The stock fell 3.1%.</TE>
<TE>   And anxiety about Vodafone, which also is scheduled to release
results today, weighed on Britain's FTSE-100. The index slipped 32.80
points, or 0.6%, to 5,136.30. The mobile phone company finished down
7.1%.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. markets reopen today.</TE>

<HD>Qualcomm Rejects Skepticism Over Its Sales Forecast</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Investors say chip maker's estimates are too high
because not enough consumers will want new phones.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Qualcomm Inc. has twice reduced its forecast for 2002 sales of mobile
phones based on the company's chips and patents. It may be time for
another cut, investors say.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego-based Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for Verizon
Wireless Inc. phones, expects worldwide sales of as many as 85
million handsets based on the code division multiple access, or CDMA,
standard it developed. The company expects U.S. sales of 34 million
phones, many with color screens and faster Internet access, to
replace old ones.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Irwin Jacobs said that skeptics underestimate the
attractiveness of the new phones and that the company's target may be
too low. Investors said the estimates are too high in part because
not enough consumers will want the new features. Verizon, the biggest
U.S. wireless operator, and Sprint Corp., the fourth-largest, are
expected to sell most of the phones, analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   "The jury's still out, in my opinion, as to whether the carriers
do a good job [marketing] and whether the consumers care at this
point," said Rich Crable, a telecommunications analyst at Loomis
Sayles &amp; Co., which manages $64 billion and held about 488,000
Qualcomm shares as of March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm gets a royalty, which analysts estimate at about 5% on
average, from every CDMA phone sold by companies such as its largest
customer, Samsung Electronics Co.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm's shares have dropped 39% this year, on pace for the
third annual decline, on slower-than-anticipated sales of CDMA
phones. They fell 66 cents to $31.01 Friday on Nasdaq. U.S. markets
were closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Investors say 70 million to 75 million phones sold worldwide this
year is a more realistic target. Jacobs disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think they've fully factored in the impact of the new
technology," he said in an interview last week. In addition, the
installation of a CDMA network in India may help Qualcomm meet its
estimate, Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the company predicted 2002 CDMA phone sales of 85
million to 95 million. It reduced the forecast in January to 80
million to 90 million units, and in April to 80 million to 85
million.</TE>
<TE>   That represents about one-fifth of other companies' forecasts for
worldwide handset sales of 400 million to 420 million, for all types
of mobile phones.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm expects 42 million CDMA phones to be sold in the U.S.
this year.</TE>

<HD>Beverly Hills Gives OK to Hotel</HD>
<DH>Developer is working on financing for 133-room project on
Wilshire Boulevard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beverly Hills officials have approved what would be the city's first
new hotel in more than a decade. The developer of the Hotel Bel
Jardin--as it's being called until an operator is selected--expects
to break ground by early next year.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Crowe, who heads Santa Monica-based Hotel Development
Group, hopes to secure financing within a few months for the 133-room
hotel along the south side of Wilshire Boulevard between Maple and
Palm drives. Crowe and his local partners plan to develop the hotel
on a portion of the former Hillcrest Motors site just east of the
city's core commercial triangle.</LD>
<LD>   Crowe, who is in discussions with various luxury hotel operators,
said the eventual flag will help determine whether the Bel Jardin
would be a five-star or 4 1/2-star property. The proposed four-story
building over a two-level underground parking garage would cost about
$47 million.</LD>
<TE>   Given that business and tourist travel were subsiding even before
Sept. 11, financing for new hotels remains "very difficult to come
by," said Jordan Richman, a hotel property specialist at real estate
services company Grubb &amp; Ellis. However, considering the historical
popularity of Beverly Hills as a travel destination--and the
difficulty developing new hotels there--several lenders and investors
would probably consider funding the Bel Jardin, Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe's development team includes architect Gin Wong Associates,
which designed the Beverly Hills Four Seasons Hotel. W.E. O'Neil
Construction, now working on a city-sponsored retail development, is
the general contractor. Melendrez Design Partners is the landscape
architect, and former Beverly Hills Mayor Joseph Tilem is the group's
land-use counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe said the project would be similar in style to the 196-room,
five-star Peninsula Hotel Beverly Hills, the city's newest hotel,
completed in 1991. The Bel Jardin would include a restaurant within a
focal interior courtyard, as well as a rooftop health club and
swimming pool.</TE>

<HD>Hancock Park Club Under Renovation</HD>

<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The historic Wilshire Country Club in Hancock Park has begun a
$10-million renovation and expansion of its Mediterranean-style
clubhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion and interior remodeling, which will include the
addition of a red clay tile roof with broad eaves, arched openings
and iron railings, is aimed at recapturing the character of the
original building.</LD>
<LD>   The project was designed by Los Angeles architect Scott Johnson of
Johnson Fain Partners.</LD>
<TE>   The 48,000-square-foot clubhouse will be renovated and expanded by
3,500 square feet, and 2,200 square feet of outdoor terrace will be
added.</TE>
<TE>   A new tree-lined driveway will lead to a heavy-timber
porte-cochere. At the western side of the clubhouse, an expansive
terrace paved with red terra cotta tile will provide additional
outdoor dining areas. A new outdoor courtyard will feature a
hand-painted tile fountain and wood trellis.</TE>
<TE>   Work began in April, and the project is slated for completion by
summer 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Our renovation will enhance the benefits of membership and at the
same time make a significant contribution to preserving Hancock
Park's history for future generations," said Gerald Palmer, president
of Wilshire Country Club, which was founded in 1919.</TE>

<HD>Help Palestinians Nurture Democracy</HD>
<DH>Elections held after passions have cooled would be a big
step.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NOAH FELDMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Yasser Arafat announced recently that he intended to reform the
Palestinian Authority and hold elections in the next six months, some
eyes rolled. But friends of peace should put aside understandable
disappointment with Arafat and encourage both elections and the
creation of a political climate in which elections are possible. The
nascent Palestinian democracy must be nurtured, not abandoned as
stillborn.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the failings of the last six-plus years, a future
Palestinian state still holds the promise of being the first viable
Arab democracy, an exception to the assortment of monarchs and
dictators who are America's allies in the region.</LD>
<LD>   No one seriously opposed Arafat in the 1996 general election in
which he became chairman--or president, depending on who is
talking--but perhaps that was because of his early success in
negotiating the beginnings of a Palestinian state.</LD>
<TE>   The circumstances of occupation have hindered the democratic
process, and law enforcement has ranged from spotty to nonexistent.
Few inside or outside the occupied territories doubt allegations of
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the fact remains that Palestinians have had the opportunity to
participate in the selection of their own leaders. And while they may
not be perfectly satisfied with the results, that has not led to a
rejection of democracy but rather to renewed calls to make democracy
work as it is supposed to.</TE>
<TE>   Exposed at close quarters to Israel's complex parliamentary
system, the Palestinians understand democracy better than citizens of
most Arab states. With an educated and increasingly committed
diaspora, they stand a good chance of constructing democratic
institutions as soon as tensions begin to lift.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, Palestinians may be furious with Israel, and vice
versa, but they still want the democratic structures that Israel has.
Israel, for its part, knows that a functioning Palestinian democracy
would be the best guarantor of its own security.</TE>
<TE>   But will elections lead to significant gains for Hamas or other
hard-line organizations? This is a microcosm of a more general
question about democracy in the Muslim world.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1990 elections in Algeria, it has been conventional
wisdom that elections in Muslim countries may be counterproductive
for promoting moderation because they may lead to the election of
Islamists who oppose U.S. interests and reject peace with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, some extremists may be elected. In the long
term, though, participating in electoral politics is more likely to
moderate Islamist positions than to exacerbate rejectionism. Islamist
politicians want to win elections and participate in pragmatic
governance. Islamists in Egypt and Jordan do disagree with many of
their governments' moderate policies, but they do so in tones that
are increasingly informed by the aspiration to become conventional
political players, not revolutionaries in waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Two decades ago, it would have seemed hopelessly naive to imagine
elections happening in Iran, which is still embroiled in an internal
contest between those who would export terror and those who seek
reform. Yet Iran's fitful and incomplete experiment with
comparatively free elections has influenced the rise of democratic
rhetoric and strategy throughout the Muslim world, just as the
Iranian revolution inspired transnational dreams of violent Islamic
revolution.</TE>
<TE>   The key to facilitating real democracy while combating extremism
is to exercise caution. Palestinian elections should occur not today
or tomorrow, and perhaps not even in six months, but after passions
have begun to cool.</TE>
<TE>   The result may not be exactly the democracy that the United States
or Israel wants, but achieving democracy at all would be an important
victory for peace, security and freedom. Instead of dismissing the
Palestinians' tentative democracy, we should be helping to build it.</TE>

<HD>At-Home Spying: Privacy Wanes as Technology Gains</HD>
<DH>Surveillance may be legal, but is that the only standard?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY T. MARX</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recently in France, a father who was concerned about the possible
mistreatment of his 3-year-old son by a baby-sitter's boyfriend hid a
miniature camera in his home to record any suspicious behavior. The
father found some, but it was not abuse of the child; the camera
revealed the baby-sitter and her boyfriend amorously entangled while
the child slept soundly in the next room.</LD>
<LD>   The father paid a penalty. In France, such videotaping is a
violation of criminal and civil law. The father was arrested and
ordered to pay a fine for invasion of privacy.</LD>
<LD>   Did the father do something wrong? Is there a victim here? As the
ubiquitous advertisements for cameras concealed in teddy bears and
other unlikely places remind us, parents have an obligation to
protect their children. A hidden video camera offers an easy way to
do this--to the extent that seeing is believing. If nothing is found,
the responsibly vigilant parents rest well knowing that the child was
not harmed. If something is found, there is tangible evidence for
taking protective and even legal action.</LD>
<TE>   Different privacy standards characterize home and work, as well as
areas within these. The baby-sitter after all was not filmed in her
own home but at her place of work.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the French parents had alternatives. They could have
discussed their concerns with the sitter, checked to see whether
other employers had had problems with her, banned the boyfriend or
simply found another baby-sitter. If there are some grounds for
doubt, why take a chance by spying? And, as it turns out, the law was
on the baby-sitter's side.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., the employer largely sets the conditions of work. To
use the French baby-sitter as an example, the camera was in the
living room, not in a bathroom where the expectation of privacy would
have been greater. The place and the video equipment belonged to the
parents, and the baby-sitter willingly came to the home. The images
weren't sold on the Internet, used as blackmail or stolen.</TE>
<TE>   To cast the best light on the father, he wanted to have the
evidence in hand before deciding to fire the sitter. The use of
hidden cameras is hardly an uncommon or exotic means for this. And,
had the father been living in the U.S. instead of France, in most
jurisdictions he would have broken no law.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this videotaping, even if well-intentioned and revealing
nothing incriminating, is patently offensive. E.M. Forster captured
this well in noting: "For it is a serious thing to have been watched.
We all radiate something curiously intimate when we believe ourselves
to be alone." Secretly recording people violates their dignity and
can put the individual at an unfair strategic disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   We assume, or at least morally expect, that under ordinary
circumstances behavior behind closed doors, in darkness and at a
distance will be protected from the eavesdropping of third parties.
We also have a right to assume that interaction and communication are
ephemeral and transitory and are not subject to being captured and
preserved through hidden video or audio means without our knowledge.
Another unintended consequence is that sometimes people seeking
specific information--i.e., whether their child is being
mistreated--may observe something even they didn't want to know.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, remotely transmitted signals might be picked up by
others in the vicinity. The behavior of the spy is thus doubly
troubling. Not only is he invading the privacy of those he is
watching, but he may unwittingly enable others to invade as well.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that there is still a legal right to secretly record
images in the U.S. does not mean that it is the right thing to do. We
would do well to learn from the French the general principle of
respect for private life, a principle that holds no matter what new
technologies are offered to us that allow us to spy on others.</TE>

<HD>Bearded-Lady Saint Offers Comfort to a Generation in
Waiting</HD>
<DH>With a nod to St. Starosta, a single woman contentedly
delays marriage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DINA RABADI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a dark corner of the Loreta Chapel near Prague Castle in the Czech
Republic, there hangs a bearded lady on a cross above an early rococo
altar.</LD>
<LD>   She is known by various names--St. Starosta or St. Wilgefortis
among them--and legend has it that her father tried to force her to
marry the king of Sicily, despite her vow of virginity.</LD>
<LD>   She prayed to God for help, and God, taking pity on the woman,
gave her a beard to repel her future husband.</LD>
<TE>   Her father, furious when he found out, had her crucified. Thus
Starosta went into history as the saint of unhappily married women.</TE>
<TE>   I looked up at the figure of the bearded lady while visiting the
chapel and thought about the role of marriage in my life.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of my friends, I am in my late 20s and have never
married. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, that puts me in one of
the fastest-growing categories in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, in less than 30 years, the "never married" number has
doubled, and the average age of those entering a first marriage is at
a record high: 25 for women, 27 for men.</TE>
<TE>   Some consider these trends catastrophic.</TE>
<TE>   "A titanic loss of family values," according to a recent article
in the Washington Times. "Today's young Americans seem especially
indifferent to traditional notions of marriage and morality."</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, these trends within my generation indicate a rise
of consciousness and commitment that will resurrect the institution
of marriage, not destroy it.</TE>
<TE>   My generation grew up in the 1980s, in the midst of the divorce
revolution. And if our parents weren't divorced, a lot of them should
have been.</TE>
<TE>   Among the quiet corners of our homes, away from the yelling and
the name-calling, we huddled with our brothers, sisters and friends,
vowing we would never have a marriage like this one.</TE>
<TE>   When my generation went to college, we soon learned about the
research on marriage: Marriage has a much better chance of success if
it is postponed.</TE>
<TE>   Your 20s should be a time to forge your identity--a time to
travel, meet new people, develop a life philosophy, move to your
dream city.</TE>
<TE>   The research was further enforced by the culture of our times.
Author Beverly Engel told us about "Loving Him Without Losing You";
Madonna taught us how to "Express Yourself," and Oprah Winfrey showed
us the importance of financial independence.</TE>
<TE>   So my best friend went to medical school, my other best friend
joined the Peace Corps and I went to Prague to write a short-story
collection.</TE>
<TE>   We wanted to get married, but we wanted to do other things as
well. The men we were dating found that attractive and, in fact,
seemed to prefer it.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, it is not surprising that more than 80% of young women
surveyed in the 2001 National Marriage Project, conducted by Rutgers
University, agreed that "it is more important for them to have a
husband who can communicate about his deepest feelings than to have a
husband who makes a good living." (In a 1965 survey, three out of
four college women said they would marry a man they didn't love if he
fit their criteria in every other way.) And 94% of the never-married
women in their 20s surveyed in the 2001 report agreed that "when you
marry, you want your spouse to be your soul mate, first and
foremost."</TE>
<TE>   As the wage gap between men and women closes, as men take on more
responsibility at home and in relationships and as women gain ground
in higher education and in the work force, the institution of
marriage itself is changing.</TE>
<TE>   It is becoming less about security, financial gain and social
status. It is becoming about love. Although we are not the first
generation to marry for love, we are the first to wait to do so in
such great numbers.</TE>
<TE>   It is this awareness of ourselves, of our partners, of our vision
of a marriage of soul mates that will resurrect the institution and
make it last. Traditional notions of marriage and morality haven't
been working.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to bring down the bearded lady and give her a chance.</TE>

<LD>This spring, Mark Charles Volpa Jr. locked himself in his
grandmother's bedroom. His mother, Anita, was frantic but not
surprised. Three times in five years her 21-year-old son had tried to
kill himself. He said he was hearing voices. After three days, Anita
broke in through a window.</LD>
<LD>   At her home, his condition worsened. According to the Fresno Bee,
he told his mother he was injecting drugs straight into his head. She
eventually took him to Fresno County's psychiatric assessment center.</LD>
<LD>   The events that followed illustrate an impassioned debate over a
bill working its way through the Legislature in Sacramento. AB1421,
by Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis), would let judges, after
consulting with psychiatrists and family members, compel some
severely mentally ill people to accept outpatient treatments such as
medication and counseling.</LD>
<TE>   In recent weeks, a tireless group of mental health advocates and
civil libertarians has lobbied committee members to kill the bill
before it reaches the full Senate.</TE>
<TE>   These opponents note that as late as the mid-20th century,
psychiatrists, judges and other authorities declared that "lunatics"
weren't entitled to basic human rights and forcibly subjected them to
sterilization, lobotomies or "zombifying" medications. Some reject
the widely accepted evidence that medical treatment of mental illness
is vastly improved since those dark days. Others contend that the
bill is a symptom of a society that still doesn't understand mental
illness. They say that America's inherent impatience, combined with
drug companies' lust for profits, has led to simplistic
pharmaceutical solutions to problems stemming from poverty,
loneliness and a complexity of other social ills.</TE>
<TE>   One can accept all of these points, however, and still find them
ultimately irrelevant to AB1421--dubbed "Laura's law" after a young
woman killed by a man whose mental illness went untreated despite the
efforts of family members who knew he was unstable when he didn't
take his medications.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Volpa's mother apparently found herself in a similar position
this month. She had implored officials to keep her son in the
hospital, saying he clearly remained out of control. But the staff
did not deem him imminently suicidal and let him go--and current law
does not require any follow-up to make sure a patient is getting
care.</TE>
<TE>   Police say that last week Volpa was driving on a rural road just
north of Clovis, Calif., when, under circumstances that remain
unclear, he encountered Sheriff's Deputy Dennis Phelps, a 47-year-old
father of two. The police say Volpa shot Phelps in the face, killing
him, then sped away in the officer's patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, a SWAT team surrounded a camper where Volpa had been
hiding in a densely wooded area of the Fresno County foothills. When
he tried to escape, brandishing a rifle, the officers shot him to
death.</TE>
<TE>   Laura's law might have allowed Volpa's mother to get him the care
he didn't know he needed.  On June 12, the Senate Health and Human
Services Committee will decide whether to approve or kill the
legislation that could begin fixing the problem his story
exemplifies.</TE>
<TE>   These lawmakers should listen respectfully to the bill's
opponents: Yes, only a small minority of people with mental illness
are dangerous. Yes, courageous people with severe mental illness
often battle back to health, usually without coercion. Yes, these
people's rights must be respected.</TE>
<TE>   But the lawmakers also should ask themselves this: With Volpa and
a law enforcement officer dead, whose civil liberties have been
protected?</TE>

<LD>Do you remember the March 5 primary election? Do you remember which
candidates were nominated for November? Will you still remember as
spring becomes summer and summer becomes fall, in the longest
campaign in state history?</LD>
<LD>   If the answer to any of these questions is no, don't blame
yourself. And don't blame yourself for being sicker of politics than
ever.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 campaign started just after Christmas 2001 and won't be
over until the Christmas decorations are in the stores again.</LD>
<TE>   It doesn't have to stay that way. Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) has
a bill to restore some sanity to the election calendar by moving the
state primary from early March to late summer. The Legislature should
pass Johnson's SB 1975 and send it to the governor for his signature.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Johnson proposed holding the primary the first week in
September, but election officials complained that would not give them
enough time to prepare for the general election. So Johnson changed
the primary to the first week in August. The measure has passed two
committees with only one vote against it and now is before the full
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials say that even August is too late to meet many
of their deadlines, but the Legislature should be able to change the
deadlines. After all, 24 states will hold their primaries in August
and September this year--as late as Sept. 21, in Hawaii. Besides, the
new California date would not go into effect until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   California did not get a March primary out of desire. It was
because of presidential politics. Over the years, beginning in 1946,
the August primary turned into the June primary, which became the
late March primary and finally the early March primary, all in the
hope of having a bigger influence on the presidential nominating
process. Lawmakers had considered holding a separate state primary
but balked at the extra cost, estimated at $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the cost to democracy of holding an early March
state primary is too great. Turnout is at record lows; the cost of
campaigning for 11 months is unsupportable, as is elected officials'
diversion from their real jobs. Those who complain that an August
primary would fall during summer vacation should compare that with
the mess of yearlong campaigns. It's no contest.</TE>

<LD>Ever wonder what might happen if Calista Flockhart shoved Tinky Winky
the Teletubby into a cosmic wormhole?</LD>
<LD>   Until now, the scientific consensus was that the result would be
decidedly grim. This month, though, two respected quantum physicists
detailed a possible way to safely traverse these theoretical
shortcuts to other parts of the universe.</LD>
<LD>   The authors--Hisa-aki Shinkai from Japan's Riken Institute of
Physical and Chemical Research and Sean Hayward from Korea's Ewha
Womans University--are the first scientists to bravely venture where
only Trekkies and other science-fiction buffs have gone before. Their
mathematical model examined what might happen if someone were to use
the wormholes that supposedly exist all around us to get themselves
or some object from point A to Z. Initially, their calculations
showed that such matter would instantly become toast. It would
generate so much "positive energy" that the wormhole would collapse
into a crushingly dense black hole. Hayward and Shinkai persevered,
however, and came up with a novel way of using "negative energy" to
keep the portal propped open.</LD>
<TE>   If their ingenious key ends up working, the possibilities are
boggling.</TE>
<TE>   Cash-strapped NASA could charge wealthy wormhole wanderers at
least the $20 million that South African businessman Dennis Tito
reportedly shelled out for a ticket to the International Space
Station last year. Companies like Enron could dump their accounting
ledgers straight into oblivion, sidestepping the shredders. There
might even be room for all those '60s-style polyester suits that the
Melrose hipsters claim are making a "retro chic" comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it will be some time before those scenarios are even
remotely possible. But given that wormholes seem the appropriate
place for so many people and things, perhaps there's comfort to be
found in their theoretical abundance. Come to think of it, maybe they
explain why that thin, bearded Saudi guy with the girlish voice and
deceptively gentle eyes has been so elusive of late.</TE>

<LD>I am disappointed in your May 21 editorial, "Tom Rows the Boat
Ashore," regarding the proposed Center for the Development of Peace
and Well-Being at UC Berkeley. Peacemaking is not about the absence
of conflict but its resolution by nonviolent means. The evidence of
current events at all levels is that we Americans have very little
knowledge of how to go about such resolution.</LD>
<LD>   One primary contributor to the culture of violence epidemic around
us is an attitude of mockery whenever people, ideas and institutions
devote themselves to foundational human values. I regret that The
Times has lowered its editorial page to that standard.</LD>

<LD>Re "O'Neill, Bono Differ on Needs of Poor," May 23:</LD>
<LD>   How quaint a vision! Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill goes to a
market in Ghana as a representative of this hyper-capitalistic
administration and sees little, budding global entrepreneurs and loan
recipients--people we can do business with if only they were given
the freedom to work for us, making more of whatever they make and
doing it for less, unconstrained by pesky regulations regarding
wages, conditions and workload. Basically, he asks, "What's in it for
us?"</LD>
<LD>   Rock singer Bono sees a country in need of aid for roads, water
and basic sanitation so that its people can be independent and
self-sufficient. Less glamorous, but more noble to be sure. As
Americans, must we always ask how we can benefit from the labors of
others or should we help others to help themselves in achieving
sustainable, stable economies? That is a question that divides us as
a nation.</LD>
<TE>   Selfishness or selflessness? How unfortunate for those who just
want a sustainable, peaceful planet that affords the greatest number
of people a pleasant existence.</TE>

<LD>Michael Ramirez's political cartoon (Commentary, May 23) strikes me
as remarkably insensitive. In the wake of rumors about more New York
landmarks being targeted for terrorist attacks he has depicted the
Statue of Liberty standing on a stool and holding up her skirt like
the proverbial housewife panicking over a mouse. Not only is this
insulting to women (who are usually the ones in the household who
take care of vermin) but it is extremely insulting to New Yorkers.</LD>
<LD>   Ramirez seems to forget that New York actually has been attacked,
and quite viciously. It is absolutely understandable for New Yorkers
to be nervous--or did he think the citizens of the Big Apple were
supposed to be thick-skinned toughs who shrug off everything?</LD>

<LD>Re "Bird Deaths by Power Lines to Be Studied," May 23: You've got to
be kidding me! A $1-million grant to study bird deaths by power
lines? After all the money that has been flushed down the toilet in
the wake of the power crisis, couldn't a better use for this money
have been found?</LD>
<LD>   Please print the results of this study in The Times so that we can
all see what we got for this money. This $1-million study will
probably result in a $100-million proposal to station people with
bullhorns next to the power wires in an effort to shoo the birds
away.</LD>

<LD>Re "U.S. Delay Imperils S. Asia," editorial, May 23: Far from it!
Delay on the part of the United States will aid in calming South Asia
and Kashmir. Third-party involvement and internationalizing Kashmir
are the principal goals of the Pakistani-sponsored terrorism and
nuclear blackmail. So rewarding it will bring more of it.</LD>
<LD>   It is time that Washington followed a principled and consistent
stance in our war against terrorism. That includes not coddling and
rewarding states "sponsoring terrorism," namely Pakistan. So far,
Pakistan has given us journalist Daniel Pearl's decapitation in
addition to sheltering the Al Qaeda leadership. This is our payback
for $1 billion in U.S. aid since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   It is time we got our house in order before calling other nations
"state sponsors of terrorism." Are we any different?</LD>
<TE>   Ravi Razdan</TE>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial is right on. The Bharatiya Janata Party led by
India's Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has been losing in state
elections. Due to the recent carnage against Muslims in Gujarat
state, it is guaranteed a defeat by the moderate Congress Party. To
upgrade its sagging hard-line image it needs a fight with archfoe
Pakistan to gain its popularity once more.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has repeatedly offered to negotiate peacefully to settle
the "Kashmir dispute," but New Dehli has not been forthcoming. It
seems Vajpayee wants this war, at the prodding of hard-liners in his
government and other groups. If this war breaks out, it would
adversely affect America's war on terrorism in neighboring
Afghanistan. Pakistan would be forced to pull out thousands of its
troops fighting alongside the U.S. Special Forces and move them to
Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   A nuclear war breaking out is a worse scenario, since American
forces are deployed all over Pakistan in four major air bases leased
to the U.S. by President Pervez Musharraf.</TE>

<HD>For Lack of a Bin, Recyclables Dumped</HD>

<LD>Every Tuesday, under the cover of darkness, I leave my Sherman Oaks
apartment building with bundles of recyclable goods. I sneak over to
the residential neighbors, the ones with the expensive houses and
huge recycling containers, to dump my load. My wealthy neighbors have
their containers proudly displayed on the street for the garbage men
to collect Wednesday morning. I lift up the lid on the large blue
receptacle, the one reserved for recyclables. I look around, like a
thief in the night, and quickly dispose my load into a half-empty
container.</LD>
<LD>   Tons of recyclable goods are being dumped into landfills because
the apartment dwellers are being ignored by L.A.'s recycling program.
Every family dwelling in Los Angeles has three bins provided by this
program. One is for garbage, one is for yard trimmings and the third
is for recyclable goods.</LD>
<LD>   Recyclable goods are clean paper, newspaper, cardboard, magazines,
mail, telephone books, aluminum, steel and tin cans, glass bottles
and jars and plastic bottles.</LD>
<TE>   Currently, for those who live in apartments, the system has a few
recycling centers throughout town, but most people opt to throw their
recyclables in the garbage rather than take extra time to visit one
of these centers. I propose that apartment buildings be included in
this program and be provided with an appropriate bin in which
recyclable goods can be placed.</TE>

<HD>No Advantages in a New Valley City</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I have yet to read a solid argument for a new Valley city. I do not
think a city the size of the Valley is going to be any more
responsive to the citizens than a city the size of Los Angeles. I am
sure a new city council would be just as hard to reach as the current
council members. I am sure the Building and Safety Department would
be no more receptive to new building permits than before. I don't see
our trees trimmed more than every seven years or our streets repaved
more than once every two decades. I am sure voice-mail menus would
replace real people and "better" service would be a myth.</LD>
<LD>   Until someone can show me a more efficient, better-run, more
people-friendly plan for the Valley city, I cannot support the
movement. And can someone promise that the new Valley city won't
raise taxes to support the new infrastructure--City Hall,
administration, bureaus and agencies?</LD>

<TE>   I read with regret Gale Holland's piece regarding Valley secession
(Opinion, May 19). Clearly, the worst tactic of those opposing
secession is to insult the Valley. For example, Holland writes,
"Bereft of a major airport, port, research universities, water, sewer
and utilities infrastructure ... it's hard to see how the Valley
would be perceived as anything more than another suburban sprawl."
She states that "the Valley's insularity renders its voters
ill-equipped to decide the secession question."</TE>
<TE>   If Holland knew the Valley, then she would have described us as
incredibly diverse, knowledgeable, cosmopolitan and well equipped to
vote on both local and national issues. I doubt that she would attack
the knowledge or sophistication of those who reside in Long Beach,
Culver City or the San Gabriel Valley--even though the people in
these communities choose to acquire their municipal services from
their own local entities and do not seek to be annexed by Los
Angeles. The Los Angeles region consists of 15 million intelligent,
diverse and knowledgeable people--and the 70% of those in our region
who acquire their municipal services from sources other than Los
Angeles are neither ignorant nor insular.</TE>

<TE>   In a classic "be careful what you wish for" scenario, Valley
voters secede and the Valley becomes a junior version of the city
they loathe, forever tethered to it for water, power and public
safety needs. So what happens next? A dissatisfied Valley group moves
to secede again in order to join the city of San Fernando!</TE>

<LD>Re "County Health System Faces Dire Options," May 23: Most Americans
remain reluctant to support tax increases to assure access to health
care for the uninsured or to replace their current coverage with a
comprehensive program of public insurance.</LD>
<LD>   The lack of funding for the uninsured has resulted in the drafting
of plans that, at a minimum, would close the King/Drew trauma center.
Even affluent auto accident victims are threatened by a system that
causes them to bypass a locked-up trauma center as they are
transported to an overcrowded facility through heavily congested city
traffic. People will die no matter how much money they have.</LD>
<LD>   The recent California Health and Human Services landmark study of
health-care reform demonstrated that we already are spending enough
to provide truly comprehensive care for absolutely everyone. But what
we lack is a rational system to properly direct those funds.</LD>
<TE>   Our current system of private health plans, government plans and
no plans at all is egregiously wasteful of our resources. The study
revealed that merely replacing this sick system with a single, more
efficient program of universal health insurance would solve most of
the problems in funding and access in health care without
significantly increasing costs. Why aren't we taking a serious look
at this proposal?</TE>

smart can tell me how come the party elected by the NRA--with
bragging rights assumed by Charlton Heston for just that
accomplishment--has backed off on having guns in the cockpits of our
airplanes. At the same time, it lobbies for concealed guns in many of
our states, saying this would bring law and order back again. Am I
missing something?</LD>

went to the store seeking a refund on a deposit the woman placed on a
wedding dress. The store refused to pay and an argument spilled into
the street, attracting a crowd.</LD>

Davis said. The crowd smashed the car windows and beat its occupants.</TE>

<LD>   A car chase in southern Italy ended in a deadly shootout between
rival Mafia families.</LD>
<TE>   But these were not the usual suspects. The gun-toting clan leaders
were fiftysomething mothers and teenage girls, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, things are changing even in these feuds," the Corriere

<TE>   The protagonists in Sunday's bloodbath were the wives and
granddaughters of Camorra gangster families, the Mafia organization

girl were killed.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France</DL>
<LD>Amid the stillness of the graves above Omaha Beach, President Bush on
Monday summoned the memory of the American sacrifice that liberated
Europe 58 years ago to stir another alliance now joined to fight
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   He spoke of heartbreak at home, of dedication to liberty far away,
and said, "Our security is still bound up together in a transatlantic
alliance, with soldiers in many uniforms defending the world from
terrorists at this very hour."</LD>
<LD>   The president gave two short, understated speeches on a gray, wet
Memorial Day that emphasized the task to which he has dedicated his
administration: winning the anti-terrorism campaign that began with
the attacks on Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   With French President Jacques Chirac seated in a front pew of the
stone church of Sainte-Mere-Eglise, the first village liberated on
D-day, June 6, 1944, Bush said that the fight against terrorism will
require "a sacrifice I can promise you we'll make."</TE>
<TE>   The alliance the United States assembled after Sept. 11, he said,
defends "our freedoms against people who can't stand freedom."</TE>
<TE>   In the American Cemetery here, the president approached the podium
alone and unannounced, striding amid white marble grave markers. The
Latin crosses interspersed with occasional Stars of David, each
decorated for the occasion with U.S. and French flags, are row upon
row a fearful reminder of loss. They face west over the Norman
countryside, toward the Atlantic, toward home.</TE>
<TE>   "Words can only go so far in capturing the grief and sense of loss
for the families of those who died in all our wars. For some military
families in America and in Europe, the grief is recent, with the
losses we have suffered in Afghanistan," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "They can know, however, that the cause is just and, like other
generations, these sacrifices have spared many others from tyranny
and sorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Continuing a Tradition</TE>
<TE>   Bush followed a route well trod by presidents.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Carter walked the beach on a cold January morning in 1978.
On the 40th anniversary of D-day in 1984, Ronald Reagan delivered one
of his most moving speeches, reminding the world of the sacrifices of
"the boys of Pointe du Hoc." They were the soldiers who climbed a
100-foot cliff to silence German artillery that held a commanding
position.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, Bill Clinton summoned the spirit of the heroes
buried here to carry on new missions in defense of freedom--and to
exorcise doubts about the leadership of a president who had not
served in the military.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sept. 11 attacks put this presidential visit on a
different plane. It presented Bush a historical metaphor--and, with
the 9,386 graves here, a graphic one--for a message he has delivered
across the United States and now across Europe, from Germany to
Moscow and on Monday above the beaches where a fading generation of
Americans fought and fell in pursuit of a continent's liberty.</TE>
<TE>   He used the metaphor only sparingly at the cemetery. There, by
custom, presidential speeches have focused on the broadest meaning of
D-day and its enduring message of sacrifice for the freedom of the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, where we stand today, the New World came back to liberate
the Old. A bond was formed of shared trial and shared victory. And a
light that scattered darkness from these shores and across France
would spread to all of Europe--in time, turning enemies into friends,
and the pursuits of war into the pursuits of peace," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of allies uniting to defend freedom at a time when many
political leaders in Europe are facing mounting skepticism among
their citizens about expanding the war on terrorism, perhaps to
topple President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Before his speech here, Bush spent several minutes touring the
battlefield atop the cliffs where the German guns had sat. He propped
his umbrella against a wall, took the hand of his wife, Laura, and
walked along a grassy bluff. They looked silently over the English
Channel as the sound of waves below wafted over the beach and up the
cliff. A military band played "America the Beautiful" in the
distance.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony was short, no more than half an hour from Bush's
arrival to the moment when a U.S. Air Force F-15 disappeared straight
up into the clouds as part of a missing-man formation.</TE>
<TE>   'It's Always There'</TE>
<TE>   The visit by a president born two years after D-day was a show of
solidarity with an aging generation in the United States, for whom
World War II defined a lifetime and for whom D-day was the pivotal
moment.</TE>
<TE>   Their representatives were here Monday in dwindling numbers. Isaac
Phillips came from his home in Belgium, where he has lived for half a
century after a youth spent in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "Heartbreak," he said, offering but one word to describe his
emotions.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had come ashore in chest-high water, his rifle held
over his head, at Utah Beach. He was four days shy of his 20th
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything comes back, but everything, before it comes back, is
always there," he said. His unique accent is a thick soup, bred of
the American South and Belgium, and he struggles now with his English
after speaking French for so long.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're sleeping, when you're eating, you can do anything,
but it's always there," he said of his memories.</TE>
<TE>   Those memories were ripe, too, for a Frenchman whom Lorry Gunhus,
66, a veteran of the Korean War, encountered Monday morning in a
nearby village. Gunhus choked up telling the story.</TE>
<TE>   The elderly man was wearing a baseball cap of a certain New York
sports team, so Gunhus, visiting from his home in West Concord,
Minn., asked whether he was a Yankee fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an America fan," the man replied.</TE>
<TE>   The first D-day assaults took place at the strand code-named Omaha
Beach, reaching from Colleville-sur-Mer west to Vierville, roughly
six miles, after a nighttime crossing of the English Channel.</TE>
<TE>   The troops were pinned down by the Germans atop the cliffs, and
half of those in the initial invading force died at the shoreline or
on the beach. But by the evening of June 6, they had taken three
villages from the occupying Germans.</TE>
<TE>   West to Utah Beach and Pointe du Hoc, east to beaches whose code
names are now the quirky-sounding facts of history--Gold Beach, Juno
Beach, Sword Beach--the troops fought their way ashore, eventually to
liberate Paris on Aug. 25, sending the Nazis into retreat and, nine
months later, to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   In the first hour, 135,000 troops and roughly 20,000 vehicles were
brought ashore. Although the casualties at Omaha Beach would remain
in public memory, the losses were smaller than military planners
anticipated, according to histories of the invasion.</TE>
<TE>   All told, there were 9,758 allied casualties attributed to the
invasion, 6,603 of them American.</TE>
<TE>   "Our wars have won for us every hour we live in freedom. Our wars
have taken from us the men and women we honor today, and every hour
of the lifetimes they had hoped to live," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "The day will come when no one is left who knew them, when no
visitor to this cemetery can stand before a grave remembering a face
and a voice. The day will never come when America forgets them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A Town Remembers</TE>
<TE>   Paratroopers from the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions were
dropped over Sainte-Mere-Eglise under the cover of darkness before
D-day dawned.</TE>
<TE>   Their attack was to have been a surprise. But a farmhouse fire had
awakened the town, and most of the men died from German fire before
landing.</TE>
<TE>   Pvt. John Steele's parachute became entangled in a church steeple,
and he survived by pretending to be dead.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, hundreds of the town's 1,612 residents gathered in the
square to greet Bush and Chirac. Some displayed the French tricolor,
and dozens of children held small American flags. In their fists,
orange gerber daisies, pink peonies and roses, white calla lilies,
and sprays of white, yellow and purple wildflowers added dots of
color to the day.</TE>
<TE>   The aged Norman church has been updated: The stained glass windows
depict the liberation. One shows three paratroopers dressed in
fatigues floating downward, with a barefoot Virgin Mary, baby Jesus
in her arms, looming protectively over them.</TE>
<TE>   Three town firemen, wearing the red scarves and shiny silvery
helmets of their dress uniform, stood at attention in honor of the
American firefighters who died Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In the photographs that form the current image of 1944 Normandy,
the fields are gray, the farmhouses gray, the battered villages gray
and charred, and a smoky pall hangs over all.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the fields are a vivid green and peaceful, the highways are
ribbons of commerce, not battle. The Hotel Mercure advertises "Golf
Omaha Beach," and in Bayeux, McDonald's serves burgers.</TE>
<TE>   And at the church in Sainte-Mere-Eglise, a mannequin hangs from
the right steeple, caught by his snagged parachute: for new
generations, an ever-present reminder of a mission completed long
ago.</TE>

<HD>Colombia Victor Seeks U.S. Aid</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Uribe says more American support is crucial
to defeating rebels. He also proposes including paramilitaries in
talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>On his first day as Colombia's new president-elect, Alvaro Uribe
issued an urgent call Monday for help from the United States, saying
more money, more support and more understanding are needed to end
this nation's devastating guerrilla war.</LD>
<LD>   The hard-hitting former mayor, whose father was killed by the
rebels, wasted no time in asking the U.S. to provide more technical
support and more helicopters to help fight the leftist guerrillas who
have battled the government for more than 40 years.</LD>
<LD>   But in a surprise move, Uribe also proposed future peace
negotiations to include Colombia's violent right-wing
paramilitaries--the first time a Colombian leader has made such a
suggestion in public.</LD>
<TE>   "The violence we are suffering is terrorism," Uribe told a group
of international journalists at a news conference. "We need the help
of the United States in order to preserve our democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Uribe, who will not take office until August, faces a daunting
array of challenges as the next president of one of Latin America's
largest and most populous and violence-ridden countries.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrilla war, which has gradually intensified over the last
10 years, is killing this country's people, straining its resources
and frightening away foreign investment. Peace talks collapsed in
February, leading to a further escalation.</TE>
<TE>   The economy is stagnant, with external debt accounting for nearly
half the nation's $85.3-billion gross domestic product. The guerrilla
war has also begun taking a greater toll. It severely damaged oil
revenue last year through attacks on L.A.-based Occidental
Petroleum's oil facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment is high, and poverty blights the lives of more than
half the population of 42 million.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe is counting on international support, along with his
mandate, to achieve an ambitious set of military, economic and
governmental reforms. He won 53% of the vote Sunday, marking the
first time since Colombia's latest constitution was adopted in 1991
that any presidential candidate has won a majority and avoided a
runoff.</TE>
<TE>   A technocrat with a passion for policy, Uribe said he would begin
immediately building his Cabinet to face the challenges ahead.</TE>
<TE>   From the U.S., Uribe is seeking a laundry list: increased support
from Plan Colombia, which is designed to cut the production of drugs
in half by 2005; continuation of a trade pact that eliminates tariffs
on textiles and other products from Andean countries; and help in
obtaining better terms from global financial institutions such as the
International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, U.S. officials have already begun work on many of
the proposals. The House has approved continuation of the trade
agreement. And the Bush administration has suggested lifting
restrictions as part of its $657-million aid proposal this year and
permitting some of that money to be used directly for military
purposes. For instance, $98 million would go to train a brigade to
protect an oil pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have already expressed support for many of Uribe's
plans. U.S. Ambassador Anne W. Patterson went to Uribe's campaign
headquarters Sunday night to congratulate him even before his victory
speech.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Susan Pittman told
reporters that the United States is looking forward to working with
Uribe "to advance our shared goals of eliminating the scourges of
narcotics trafficking and terrorism, improving human rights
conditions and ensuring a prosperous future for all Colombia."</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Serpa, Uribe's closest rival and the second-place finisher
in Sunday's race, had expressed reservations about U.S. drug strategy
in the region.</TE>
<TE>   But Uribe has long backed Plan Colombia. On Monday, he urged
resumption of interdiction flights to stop drug planes and asked for
increased efforts by Mexico and the U.S. to seal their borders to
drug trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted the connection between the drug trade and Colombia's
internal conflict, where both guerrillas and paramilitary groups fund
their efforts with drug profits. Colombia supplies 90% of the cocaine
used in the U.S. and most of the heroin available in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting drugs "is essential. Colombia has to defeat drugs. If
not, we cannot create the condition to negotiate our conflicts. While
this country's violent groups continue with this source of financing,
every day we move farther and farther from final accords," Uribe
said.</TE>
<TE>   He also issued a call for the United Nations to attempt to restart
peace talks with the rebels. Since talks collapsed, Colombia's war
has slowly escalated.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do not resolve it, this conflict has the potential danger
to destabilize Latin America," Uribe said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he would negotiate with Colombia's 10,000-strong
paramilitary forces. While top U.S. officials have indicated that
such talks are inevitable, outgoing President Andres Pastrana has
avoided publicly endorsing them.</TE>
<TE>   In part, this hesitancy has stemmed from a desire to avoid
angering the rebels, who have insisted that they would not conduct
talks with paramilitary forces, their sworn enemy. And in part, it
reflects the paramilitaries' current status as outlaws without a
coherent political agenda.</TE>
<TE>   But Uribe's overtures are less than they seem. Before there can be
any talks, he has demanded that both the rebels and the
paramilitaries agree to a cessation of hostilities and an end to
violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are those the requirements? Not for my caprice, or for vanity
or arrogance. Because what the Colombian people need is relief,"
Uribe said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side has expressed any willingness to lay down its arms
before beginning talks, and it is unclear whether any international
body could change that stance.</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday, paramilitary commander Salvatore Mancuso issued a
communique congratulating Uribe on his victory.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the obstacles, Colombian peace leaders welcomed Uribe's
words.</TE>
<TE>   Ana Teresa Bernal, head of Redepaz, one of the country's leading
peace groups, said she was unsure where negotiations with
paramilitary groups would lead but that any attempt would be worth
the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hoping that he will leave the door open to discussion for
peace," Bernal said. "At the very least, they could arrive at a
humanitarian accord to avoid attacking civilians."</TE>
<TE>   Uribe was also questioned about his own security.</TE>
<TE>   By his count, he has already been the target of 15 assassination
attempts, including one in April that left four people dead and
wrecked the car in which he was traveling.</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday, Uribe said he would work to improve the security of
all Colombians--himself included.</TE>
<TE>   "God will provide," he said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Feels 'Enormity of the Loss' at U.S. Cemetery in
Normandy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Excerpts from President Bush's Memorial Day speech at the Normandy
American Cemetery in France:</LD>
<LD>   We have gathered on this quiet corner of France as the sun rises
on Memorial Day in the United States of America.</LD>
<LD>   This is a day our country has set apart to remember what was
gained in our wars and all that was lost. Our wars have won for us
every hour we live in freedom. Our wars have taken from us the men
and women we honor today and every hour of the lifetimes they had
hoped to live.</LD>
<TE>   This day of remembrance was first observed to recall the terrible
casualties of the war Americans fought against each other. In the
nearly 14 decades since, our nation's battles have all been far from
home. Here on the continent of Europe were some of the fiercest of
those battles, the heaviest losses and the greatest victories.</TE>
<TE>   And in all of those victories, American soldiers came to liberate,
not to conquer. The only land we claim as our own are the resting
places of our men and women....</TE>
<TE>   All that come to a place like this feel the enormity of the loss.
Yet for so many there's a marker that seems to sit alone. They come
looking for that one cross, that one Star of David, that one name.</TE>
<TE>   Behind every grave of a fallen soldier is a story of the grief
that came to a wife, a mother, a child, a family or a town. A World
War II orphan has described her family's life after her father was
killed on the field in Germany. "My mother," she said, "had lost
everything she was waiting for. She lost her dreams."</TE>
<TE>   There were an awful lot of perfect linen tablecloths in the house
that never got used--so many things being saved for a future that was
never to be.</TE>
<TE>   Each person buried here understood his duty but also dreamed of
going back home to the people and the things he knew. Each had plans
and hopes of his own that parted with him forever when he died.</TE>
<TE>   The day will come when no one is left who knew them, when no
visitor to this cemetery can stand before a grave remembering a face
and a voice. The day will never come when America forgets them. Our
nation and the world will always remember what they did here and what
they gave here for the future of humanity....</TE>
<TE>   On Memorial Day, America honors her own. Yet we also remember all
of the valiant young men and women from many allied nations,
including France, who shared in the struggle here and in the
suffering.</TE>
<TE>   We remember the men and women who served and died alongside
Americans in so many terrible battles on this continent and beyond.
Words can only go so far in capturing the grief and sense of loss for
the families of those who died in all our wars.</TE>
<TE>   For some military families in America and in Europe, the grief is
recent, with the losses we have suffered in Afghanistan. They can
know, however, that the cause is just. And like other generations,
these sacrifices have spared many others from tyranny and sorrow.</TE>
<TE>   Long after putting away his uniform, an American GI expressed his
own pride in the truth about all who served, living and dead. He
said, "I feel like I played my part in turning this from a century of
darkness into a century of light."</TE>
<TE>   Here, where we stand today, the New World came back to liberate
the Old....</TE>
<TE>   Our security is still bound up together in a transatlantic
alliance, with soldiers in many uniforms defending the world from
terrorists at this very hour.</TE>
<TE>   The grave markers here all face west, across an ageless and
indifferent ocean to the country these men and women served and
loved.</TE>

<HD>President Addresses Pakistan</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Musharraf pledges not to start a war with India
over Kashmir but offers no proposals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf said Monday that Pakistan would not
initiate war over the disputed region of Kashmir, but he stopped
short of promising a further crackdown on Islamic militants in a
speech unlikely to mollify either India or the international
community.</LD>
<LD>   In a nationally televised address that focused largely on
heightened tensions with neighboring India, Musharraf said Pakistan
would not fire the first shot, "but if war is thrust upon us, every
Muslim is bound to respond in kind" and would "fight to the last drop
of blood."</LD>
<LD>   The speech contained no new initiatives.</LD>
<TE>   One million troops are deployed on both sides of the Line of
Control frontier in the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, and Pakistan
ratcheted up the pressure over the weekend with two missile tests it
said were unrelated to the dispute. A third short-range missile was
test-fired early this morning. India has blamed Pakistani-backed
extremists for two major attacks in five months.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's speech appeared to be aimed mostly at his domestic
audience and the international community, which has grown
increasingly concerned that cross-border shelling and small-arms fire
could turn into an all-out war between the nuclear-armed nations.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian army said Monday that it had killed or wounded 230
Pakistani soldiers in Kashmir in the last 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's military said it killed 40 Indian soldiers Sunday and
that Indian shelling killed nine civilians and injured 25 on the
Pakistani side Monday, when the two countries exchanged heavy mortar,
artillery and machine-gun fire.</TE>
<TE>   A key ally in the U.S.-led war on terrorism, Musharraf is walking
a fine line as he tries to rein in Muslim extremists without
alienating the army by backing down on support for Kashmiri
independence.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has said his country cannot be held responsible every
time someone in Kashmir attacks Indian troops.</TE>

<HD>Blast at Israeli Mall Kills 2</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The Palestinian attacker pauses outside a
children's play center before striking. Israel blames Arafat and
continues incursions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS and TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PETAH TIKVA, Israel</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian suicide bomber strolled through a shopping mall here
Monday evening, paused to watch children play, then detonated his
explosives outside an ice cream parlor crowded with families. Two
Israelis--a toddler and her grandmother--were killed, and more than
20 adults and children were wounded, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The bombing came as the Israeli army pressed ahead with a campaign
of near-daily incursions into Palestinian towns. Israel says the
operations are aimed at capturing militants, but Palestinians say
they only deepen the occupation and further erode Palestinian
sovereignty.</LD>
<LD>   The bomber also died in Monday's attack at the Super Center
outdoor mall in the west-central Israeli city of Petah Tikva. Three
of the wounded were in serious condition. At least four children were
among the injured, police and hospital officials said.</LD>
<TE>   A Palestinian militia, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which is
affiliated with the Fatah movement of Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, claimed responsibility for the suicide attack--the
fifth in just over a week. In a statement sent to news agencies, the
militia said it was avenging Israel's killing last week of Mahmoud
Titi, the Al Aqsa commander in the Balata refugee camp in the West
Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Israel blamed Arafat directly for the attack in Petah Tikva, six
miles east of Tel Aviv. The Palestinian Authority condemned the
bombing as "harmful to our cause and struggle and to the image of the
Palestinian people before international public opinion."</TE>
<TE>   The bomber managed to elude a nationwide alert and strict
checkpoints erected to block the movement of potential terrorists,
and his success exposed the vulnerability of cities deep inside
Israel. Attacks have resumed despite a massive military campaign in
the West Bank that Israel said was aimed at wiping out suicide
bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Since the campaign officially ended earlier this month, Israel has
rejected demands by the Bush administration that it stay out of
Palestinian-controlled areas. Instead, the army has entered them at
will in what it says is a concerted effort to foil terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Israeli forces entered the West Bank town of Jenin.
The army released no details.</TE>
<TE>   The incursions--which can last from a few hours to several
days--are not a prelude to another wide-scale invasion, Defense
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, they are part of a policy that illustrates how completely
one of the underpinnings of the 1993 Oslo peace accords--security
cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority--has
vanished after 20 months of Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   In Petah Tikva, Noam Segev, a 28-year-old paramedic and car
dealer, was walking past the mall's storefronts with his wife, Ravit,
and their 3-month-old baby, Ron, when they noticed a Palestinian man
mumbling to himself.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian paused in front of the plate-glass windows of the
Trampolina play center for children, watched briefly, then rounded a
corner, Segev said. A few moments later, the man blew himself up
after passing the Explosive Pizzeria and stopping outside the
Bravissimo espresso bar and gelateria.</TE>
<TE>   Segev rushed to help victims, ripping his shirt into shreds to
serve as tourniquets. He aided a deeply cut woman, but saw a little
girl who was dead, her midsection torn apart. A blue stroller,
apparently hers, lay mangled on its side. Segev then attempted to
give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a baby who seemed to be gasping
her last breaths.</TE>
<TE>   "I served in Jenin [during the West Bank offensive], but I never
had any illusions" that the suicide attacks would stop, Segev said,
his pants stained by a child's blood. "Either we fight to the death,
or I'm going to America. I'm willing to die, but in fighting with the
enemy, not in my home. I don't want to see children die."</TE>
<TE>   Popular Gathering Spot</TE>
<TE>   for Parents and Children</TE>
<TE>   The mall is a popular after-work gathering place for young
families. Relaxed scenes of children playing and eating ice cream
while their parents sipped cappuccinos and nibbled pizza were
abruptly replaced by wrecked tables and chairs, the wounded writhing
on the ground, debris and shards of glass strewn over sidewalk tiles
and shop awnings that had been spattered with blood.</TE>
<TE>   Galit Margolinsky was with her son and a group of mothers and
their children inside a shop when they heard the huge explosion. The
women gathered their children in their arms and fled in every
direction.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw kids lying on the floor asking for help," Margolinsky said.
"Their mothers were lying on top of them, shouting, 'Save my child!'
We didn't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   The two dead were identified by police as an 18-month-old girl and
her grandmother, a woman in her 70s.</TE>
<TE>   Both the damage and the death toll could have been worse if the
explosion had not occurred outside, Israeli Police Chief Shlomo
Aharonishky said.</TE>
<TE>   Public Security Minister Uzi Landau accused Arafat of being
responsible for the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "What we see today is simply an ongoing practice, instigated by
the Palestinian Authority led by Arafat, to go out and make our
civilians, women and children, deliberate targets," he told reporters
at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon hinted of harsh retaliation,
and Landau urged a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, residents of the biblical town of Bethlehem awoke
to find Israeli troops patrolling their streets for the second time
in 24 hours. Frequent incursions have become the norm of the Israeli
army, whose commanders openly acknowledge that they have taken all
security operations into their own hands and away from Palestinian
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers imposed a curfew that confined tens of thousands of
Bethlehem residents to their homes. Tanks and armored personnel
carriers blocked streets leading to the Church of the Nativity, built
on the site where Christians believe Jesus was born, and troops
carried out house-to-house searches in the Dahaisha refugee camp and
other neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said it arrested three militants, including Ahmed
Mughrabi, 28, a Bethlehem commander of the Al Aqsa militia, which has
carried out several suicide bombings inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces were also still operating in the northern West Bank
town of Kalkilya and in villages northeast of Tulkarm as well as on
the outskirts of Ramallah--all areas under Palestinian control.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli commanders, saying they are going by intelligence
information, have been targeting towns, villages and refugee camps
where they suspect militants are planning attacks on Israelis. Troops
swoop in, usually under cover of darkness, to conduct searches and
make arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer says the raids have thwarted dozens of attacks since
Israel completed the West Bank offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "The operations are meant to prevent terror attacks and arrest
terrorists, and we will act anywhere we deem appropriate," army Chief
of Staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz said. Another senior military commander
said the army no longer recognizes any Palestinian territory as being
off-limits to Israeli forces.</TE>
<TE>   The streets of Bethlehem and neighboring Beit Jala were deserted
Monday save for armored Israeli vehicles and the occasional carload
of reporters. Residents peered warily out of the windows of their
homes from behind drawn curtains, as they had for weeks during the
Israeli army's standoff with Palestinian militants who sought refuge
in the Church of the Nativity and refused to surrender for more than
a month. The standoff was resolved earlier this month when the wanted
men inside agreed to go into exile in the Gaza Strip and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters allowed to accompany Israeli troops into Bethlehem early
Monday watched soldiers set up two sniper guns on the second floor of
a three-story building on Manger Square, near the Church of the
Nativity. During the siege of the church, Israeli snipers shot
several Palestinian militants who ventured out of the church.</TE>
<TE>   Little Resistance Is</TE>
<TE>   Encountered This Time</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Doron Mor-Yosef, commander of one of at least three
battalions that entered Bethlehem this time, said a force of jeeps
secured the area around the church at the beginning of the operation.</TE>
<TE>   They were followed by armor, as the army sought to prevent any
gunmen from again fleeing to the basilica.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, soldiers encountered no resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say the invasions make it impossible either to
rebuild their security forces or to restore a sense of normality to
towns damaged during the five-week offensive Israel launched March
29, after a suicide bomber killed 29 people at a Passover Seder in
Netanya.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israelis are doing this in order to create a rift between the
Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people," Mohammed Madani,
the Palestinian governor of the Bethlehem area, said in an interview
at his home in Beit Jala, a suburb of Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   "When they come into Area A [Palestinian-controlled territory],
the Israelis show that Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority
are unable to defend the people, and it makes the people ask: 'Why do
we have this government?'"</TE>
<TE>   Curtius reported from Bethlehem and Petah Tikva and Wilkinson from
Jerusalem.</TE>

<HD>Murder Suspect Agrees to Extradition</HD>
<DH>Crime: The man charged with shooting an abortion provider
has been held in France.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENNES, France</DL>
<LD>An American suspected of killing a New York doctor who performed
abortions has decided to return to the United States to prove his
innocence, his lawyer said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   James Charles Kopp is charged with the October 1998 sniper killing
of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home near Buffalo, N.Y. He was arrested
in the western French city of Dinan in March 2001 after more than two
years on the run.</LD>
<LD>   Kopp, 47, has decided not to fight extradition to the U.S., saying
he wants to clear his name. He formally waived his right to appeal an
extradition ruling Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "I am innocent," Kopp said in a statement released by his French
lawyer, Herve Rouzaud-Leboeuf. "I want my innocence recognized as
soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Then-Prime Minister Lionel Jospin signed an order March 22
allowing Kopp to be returned home for trial. No extradition date has
been set.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, a French court recommended that Kopp be extradited. The
court based its recommendation on assurances that the U.S. government
would not seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   However, Kopp still had the possibility of appealing the case to
France's Council of State. The 60-day deadline for Kopp to act was
extended until June 2 because of a delay in serving the order.</TE>
<TE>   Kopp is being held in Rennes, about 30 miles south of where he was
caught.</TE>
<TE>   He has been indicted on a state murder charge and federal charges
in connection with the death of Slepian, an obstetrician who provided
abortions.</TE>
<TE>   Kopp also is wanted by authorities in Canada for allegedly
shooting and wounding three doctors there.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say Kopp hid behind Slepian's home Oct. 23, 1998,
and killed the doctor with a single shot from a high-powered rifle
fired through a kitchen window.</TE>
<TE>   Kopp, known as "Atomic Dog" in antiabortion circles, disappeared
11 days later. U.S. investigators believe that he fled first to New
York City, then New Jersey, Ireland and France.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ships to Refuel in Sri Lanka</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka</DL>
<LD>Sri Lanka will allow American military aircraft and ships to refuel
and be serviced in its territory, a U.S. Embassy official said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement comes amid U.S. support for a Norwegian-brokered
cease-fire between the nation's government and the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam guerrillas to end nearly two decades of conflict. But
the embassy official played down the level of cooperation the pact
entails.</LD>
<LD>   "Planes and ships of each nation can go to the other nation for
refueling, minor servicing and repairs at cost or a payment in kind,"
said Stephen Holgate, public affairs officer at the U.S. Embassy in
Colombo, the capital.</LD>
<TE>   "Clearly when you sign an agreement, that implies a certain level
of cooperation and closeness, but this is not a quantum leap," he
said, denying local newspaper reports that the deal would allow the
U.S. to build bases on this island nation in the Indian Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the sort of agreement we have with scores of countries
around the world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. warships rarely make refueling stops in Sri Lanka.</TE>
<TE>   The Hopper, a guided missile destroyer, stopped at the island last
month. It was the first U.S. ship to make a port call in Sri Lanka in
eight years.</TE>

<HD>Alleged Kingpin Arrested</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Authorities say the man claims to have shipped tons
of cocaine to the United States.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Soldiers on Sunday captured Albino Quintero Meraz, described as a
major drug trafficker aligned with Mexico's so-called Juarez cartel
who claimed to have shipped as much as a ton and a half of cocaine
each month from Guatemala to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   At a joint news conference Monday, Defense Secretary Ricardo Vega
Garcia and Atty. Gen. Rafael Macedo de la Concha said Meraz was a
kingpin on a par with Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and Ismael Zambada,
both fugitives from Sinaloa state, and Tijuana cartel leader Benjamin
Arellano Felix, who was captured March 9.</LD>
<LD>   Meraz was taken prisoner in the Gulf of Mexico port city of
Veracruz, an important way station for northbound drugs. Six others,
including federal police officer Oscar Barron Amador, who allegedly
provided protection to Meraz, were also taken into custody, the
government said.</LD>
<TE>   As a "cell leader" in the cartel led by Vicente Carrillo Fuentes,
Meraz worked with Alcides Ramon Magana to arrange shipments of
cocaine by air and sea from Central America to mainland Mexico.
Former Quintana Roo state Gov. Mario Villanueva is alleged to have
received $500,000 per load in exchange for protection.</TE>
<TE>   Magana was arrested last June and Villanueva last May after having
been at large for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact they arrested [Meraz] is good news because it shows
they're pursuing the infrastructure of the various cartels, the
people doing the everyday work of handling money and arranging the
transportation," said Donald Thornhill Jr., special agent in the San
Diego office of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Meraz was wanted on organized crime and drug-trafficking charges
in Mexico, but there is no outstanding request for extradition from
the U.S., the attorney general said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to reiterate that this arrest deals a strong blow to
transnational criminal organizations dedicated to drug trafficking,"
Macedo de la Concha said. Meraz "purchased, transported and delivered
drugs to the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The arrest is another step in President Vicente Fox's crackdown on
drug dealers who in past years enjoyed near-immunity from arrest and
prosecution. Still at large are alleged narcos such as Guzman, who
escaped from a maximum-security federal prison in January 2001, and
Osiel Cardenas, head of the so-called Gulf cartel based in Tamaulipas
state.</TE>

<HD>Nepal Prolongs Security</HD>
<DH>Himalayas: King sees the disputed state of emergency as
necessary to combat rebels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal</DL>
<LD>King Gyanendra extended a state of emergency Monday, giving security
forces sweeping search and detention powers to crush an increasingly
violent Maoist revolt.</LD>
<LD>   The emergency rule was first imposed on the poverty-ridden
Himalayan kingdom in November to stamp out the 6-year-old rebellion
by Maoist guerrillas, who are battling to topple the constitutional
monarchy and install a Communist republic.</LD>
<LD>   "The emergency has been extended by the king according to the
constitution" for three months, state-run radio said.</LD>
<TE>   A dispute over the extension of the security measure to end the
revolt that has claimed more than 4,000 lives--2,000 in the last six
months--has plunged Nepal into political turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   The move was fiercely opposed by some members of the ruling Nepali
Congress party, which expelled Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba from
its ranks Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Deuba was ejected after he had the Parliament dissolved and
ordered elections for Nov. 13, actions he took after party members
rebelled against prolonging emergency rule.</TE>
<TE>   Deuba, who will remain prime minister as head of a caretaker
government until the elections, asked the king to extend the state of
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   The dissidents in the Nepali Congress lined up with opposition
parties against the extension of the state of emergency, saying a new
anti-terrorist law was harsh enough to fight the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   But political analysts said the quarrel had more to do with
infighting in the feud-ridden Nepali Congress.</TE>

<HD>Nurse Tells Court She Killed 30</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BUDAPEST, Hungary</DL>
<LD>On the first day of her trial for murder, the nurse who became known
as the "Black Angel" claimed Monday that she killed at least 30
patients in her care over a period of nine months.</LD>
<LD>   Timea Faludi, 25, told the court in Budapest that she remembered
administering lethal doses of drugs to 30 to 35 seriously ill elderly
patients at the capital's Gyula Nyiro hospital from May 2000 to
February 2001.</LD>
<LD>   In her confession to the court, Faludi, who has been in custody
since Feb. 19, 2001, said she considered herself guilty not only in
the eight cases of killing patients by lethal injection for which she
is charged, but in the other cases as well.</LD>
<TE>   However, she claimed that she administered the drugs to relieve
the patients' pain, not to intentionally kill them.</TE>
<TE>   Faludi became known as the "Black Angel" because of the dark
clothes she wore to work on her night shift at the hospital. Faludi
joined the hospital staff in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing her confession, the court retired to review
videotapes of her often contradictory statements to police.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not give a motive for the killings.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was expected to continue next week.</TE>

<HD>Briton Takes Over as Bosnia Envoy</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Politician Paddy Ashdown replaces Austrian
Wolfgang Petritsch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>British politician Paddy Ashdown on Monday took over as the top
international peace envoy in Bosnia-Herzegovina with a pledge to
tackle crime and create jobs in the ethnically divided and
impoverished Balkan country.</LD>
<LD>   "Bosnia and Herzegovina is more at risk from criminality and
corruption than an immediate return to nationalist conflict," he said
in a speech to Bosnia's parliament.</LD>
<LD>   Ashdown, a former leader of Britain's Liberal Democratic Party who
became deeply involved in the Balkans during the wars of the 1990s,
takes over from Austrian diplomat Wolfgang Petritsch.</LD>
<TE>   At a brief ceremony marking the hand-over, Ashdown said his task
would be to build on the foundations laid by Petritsch during his
three-year tenure.</TE>
<TE>   He is the fourth international high representative to
Bosnia-Herzegovina since the conflict ended in 1995, charged with
implementation of the Dayton, Ohio, peace treaty.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Women Still Shrouded in Anxiety</HD>
<DH>Culture: Theoretically, females are no longer required to
wear burkas. But many worry that going without will expose them to
harm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Neither the police nor the local hospital has any record of an
unveiled woman being splashed in the face with acid, but the truth of
the story is probably unimportant.</LD>
<LD>   It is the rumor's terrifying message--that women risk their safety
and virtue by abandoning the burka--that has left an indelible mark
on the psyche and self-confidence of Afghan women emerging from
Taliban repression.</LD>
<LD>   Six months after the medieval conditions that the radical Islamic
regime imposed on women were theoretically lifted, women are still
grappling with the question of how much individuality they can safely
assert.</LD>
<TE>   "Women are not being forced to wear burkas. They are doing so out
of habit and a sense that it is safer, at least in the rural areas,"
said Soraya Rahim, an advisor to the deputy prime minister in charge
of women's affairs, returned exile and fellow physician Sima Samar.
"Five years of Taliban rule has affected the minds of our people, and
it's going to take time to reverse that process."</TE>
<TE>   Like many women who have come back from Western lifestyles, Rahim,
who wore trousers and had free-flowing hair during the 20 years she
lived in Germany, has resumed wearing the modest ankle-length black
coat and chiffon veil known as the hejab in deference to what she
calls Islamic modesty and tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be a stranger among my own people," she said. "I
would feel at risk if I went about as I did when I lived in Germany."</TE>
<TE>   By moving slowly and respectfully toward equality and
independence, Rahim argues, women can avoid provoking angry or
violent reactions where they are expected to be subservient to men.</TE>
<TE>   Most women's organizations are taking that as sound advice.
They're eager to avoid the brutal backlash of the early 1990s, when
warring factions of Islamic fundamentalists committed rapes and
atrocities against women they saw as morally compromised by the
sexual equality allowed during the country's Soviet occupation.</TE>
<TE>   "With the presence of ISAF and the many countries helping
Afghanistan, we are hopeful that the tragedies of the past won't be
repeated," Rahim said, referring to the 4,500-strong International
Security Assistance Force.</TE>
<TE>   Mazuri Rostam, a 39-year-old receptionist for an aid organization,
is one of many women here in the capital who believe the acid story.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a minority of men who feel this way and might endanger
women, but even a small number can present a risk," Rostam said. She
still wears the head-to-toe burka even though she finds it
suffocating in the heat and an impediment to mobility and vision.</TE>
<TE>   Even members of the Revolutionary Assn. of the Women of
Afghanistan, a Pakistan-based feminist group that campaigned
aggressively for the liberation of abused Afghan women during the
Taliban era, say they need to be patient if they want women's
newfound rights to be lasting.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still factions within the interim government that don't
support equal rights for women," said gynecologist Shamsila Anwari, a
RAWA activist who stayed in Afghanistan despite the past decade's
repression. She is referring to the hard-line Northern Alliance
commanders now in charge of the police and armed forces, whose
moujahedeen predecessors inflicted their own brutal strictures on
women in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "I've not heard of women being physically attacked for going in
public without a burka, but there is a lot of primitive behavior in
our society, and some men feel entitled to throw stones at women
whose demeanor they consider offensive," Anwari said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not eager to see the kind of liberty that existed here 30
years ago. That's not appropriate in our country," she added. "We
want freedom and equality for Afghan women, but within the context of
Islam."</TE>
<TE>   Not all activists agree with that approach, though.</TE>
<TE>   Nasrine Gross--a leader of the aid group NEGAR, which is working
for better education and employment opportunities for Afghan
women--insists that they are safer showing their faces than cloaking
themselves in obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   "The instances of assaults and rapes that we know about have
involved women wearing burkas," said the Afghan native, who returned
to her homeland this spring after a 37-year U.S. exile. "Women who
are covered are concealing their individuality and making it easier
for the kind of men who would abuse them to do so. There is a
protection in making yourself an identifiable human being and not an
anonymous victim."</TE>
<TE>   In her stylish red blazer and black slacks, Gross argues that
Westernized Afghan women owe it to their compatriots to set an
example of independence. She is highly critical of women returning
from exile and donning veils.</TE>
<TE>   At the Afghan Institute of Learning, which provides health
education for 50,000 Afghan women, counselors advise confused women
to dress modestly but eschew the burka.</TE>
<TE>   "Women are in more danger of attack when they are under a burka
because they often aren't wearing suitable clothing underneath and
men know that," instructor Adila Kausi said.</TE>
<TE>   Those at the vanguard of asserting newfound feminist rights share
the majority opinion that there is a clear line of propriety that
women shouldn't cross.</TE>
<TE>   "A rapist cannot attack an Afghan woman if she doesn't provide the
opportunity," Kausi said. "If she goes out in a T-shirt or skimpy
clothes among men who are used to seeing women covered, they will
think she's immoral. If something were to happen to her, it would be
seen as her own fault."</TE>
<TE>   Some women object to that sentiment but admit its prevalence.</TE>
<TE>   "Women aren't really free yet. They are returning to the
workplace, and it is accepted that you can't get your job done if
you're wearing a burka. But outside on the street, most women still
wear them because they think it's safer," said a woman named Storay,
who has just relocated her Women-Unity-Reconstruction organization
here from its origins in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Many women were sexually assaulted during the chaotic power
struggles after the Soviet withdrawal more than a decade ago, Storay
recalled, and with society judging that their honor and that of their
families was thereby defiled, most committed suicide or were killed
by male relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Storay said with sadness: "There is a lot of tragedy in our past,
and not all of it is over. It will take a lot more time and patience
before we have real freedom and justice."</TE>

<HD>When in Rome, NATO Will Find Tight Security</HD>
<DH>Summit: As world leaders gather today to sign an accord
with Russia, the Italian prime minister says his nation is ready to
counter any kind of threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Italian authorities are taking extraordinary security precautions for
today's NATO-Russia summit, with strong ground and air security
forces mobilized and a 37-mile stretch of beaches closed--amid
complaints from nudists who ask how they could possibly hide weapons.</LD>
<LD>   The Italian government says it has no knowledge of a specific
threat to the meeting, during which a landmark accord is to be signed
between Russia and the 19-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
But it has deployed 15,000 military, police and paramilitary
personnel on the ground; helicopters and AWACS surveillance planes in
the air; and navy and coast guard patrols just off the coastal summit
site at Pratica di Mare Air Base. Fighter jets will be ready to take
action if needed.</LD>
<LD>   "Every type of threat, including electronic, chemical and
biological, has been taken into account," Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi told a news conference last week. "I imagine that Pratica
di Mare will be the safest place in the world during this summit."</LD>
<TE>   The summit will bring together 20 of the world's most powerful
leaders, including President Bush, Russian President Vladimir V.
Putin, French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair.</TE>
<TE>   A NATO-Russian council to be created by the summit will give
"Russia a new global status and commits the West ... to a partnership
with Moscow of profound political meaning," Berlusconi told reporters
Monday. The council will be "a formidable new instrument to promote
security and peace in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Bush arrived in Rome on Monday evening, joining Berlusconi for
dinner at a 16th century villa designed by Renaissance artist
Raphael. The president's limousine was a bit too long to easily make
a hairpin turn on the hillside road to the villa, forcing it to stop
in front of waiting journalists. During the brief delay, Bush smiled
broadly and waved enthusiastically to the cameras through the
vehicle's darkened windows.</TE>
<TE>   When the president arrived, Berlusconi embraced him, then ushered
him inside for talks in an exquisitely decorated drawing room. They
dined in a hall with a view of Rome.</TE>
<TE>   About half the top leaders attending the summit will fly into and
out of Pratica di Mare today. Escape routes from the site, about 15
miles south of Rome, have been planned, in case of emergency.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian government is requiring that airplanes flying into
Rome's main Fiumicino Airport during the summit, which lasts from 10
a.m. to 3 p.m., have at least one unarmed security guard on board to
protect against suicide hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   Many domestic and foreign airlines were forced to cancel flights
because they were could not meet the requirement. Rome's second
airport, Ciampino, was reserved for summit-related guests Monday and
today.</TE>
<TE>   Other security preparations include closure of a stretch of coast
from Anzio to Ostia, Rome's port, including a 200-yard stretch that
has been officially designated a nudist beach. A local nudist
organization said last week that it was appealing to Berlusconi,
arguing that "a naked man or woman has nowhere to hide any arms."</TE>
<TE>   Security has also been tightened in Rome's subway system, with a
strong police presence in stations and on trains.</TE>
<TE>   The air base, with many low green buildings and surrounded by
barbed wire, is run-down. Temporary buildings have been constructed
for summit activities, including a signing pavilion, a meeting hall
and a media center.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Mario Catalano told reporters visiting the site that he
tried to evoke "Roman classicism" combined with warmer and more
modern hues associated with Rome today.</TE>
<TE>   The signing pavilion, for example, has arched "windows"
reminiscent of the Colosseum that actually are sky-blue boards.</TE>
<TE>   The hall for the summit luncheon is decorated with 20 ancient
marble statues loaned by Naples' Capodimonte museum. The Italian
police force's food and hygiene squad is in charge of ensuring the
safety of the catered food.</TE>
<TE>   The area around the base is said to be the site settled more than
3,000 years ago by the ancestors of Romulus and Remus, the
mythological founders of Rome. That makes it an appropriate place for
Russia and the West "to found a new civilization," Berlusconi said
last week.</TE>

<HD>Panel Frowns on Efforts to Buy Sudan Slaves' Freedom</HD>
<DH>Africa: Some charities vow to keep 'redeeming' captives,
despite fears that cash fuels the trade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>The list of people who have paid cash to buy Sudanese slaves their
freedom includes prominent African Americans, college students in
Liberty, Mo., and even a baroness in the British House of Lords.</LD>
<LD>   But a U.S.-led commission on slavery in Sudan has frowned on the
practice, known as slave redemption or buyback, saying in a recent
report that it should not be supported.</LD>
<LD>   The report by the eight-member panel, appointed in February on the
recommendation of the U.S. peace envoy to Sudan, former Sen. John C.
Danforth, could hamper fund-raising efforts by the mainly Christian
groups that buy slaves to set them free.</LD>
<TE>   In the last several years, the groups' grass-roots campaigns have
generated significant cash from individual donors, church members and
even schoolchildren who have turned over their lunch money to help
the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, say well-meaning charities help perpetuate the
slave trade by prompting slavers to capture more people so they can
be sold to the redemption programs.</TE>
<TE>   Aid workers in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, recently suggested
that many of those being "liberated" were never abducted in the first
place but merely posed as slaves to get a share of the money--up to
$100 a person--paid to secure their release.</TE>
<TE>   Slave redemptions have become such a lucrative enterprise that the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has been fighting a
19-year civil war for autonomy in the country's south, has reportedly
entered the business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge scam operation," said Jim Jacobson, president of
Virginia-based Christian Freedom International, which discontinued
its buyback program three years ago after discovering that donors'
money bankrolled the purchase of weapons, munitions and luxury items
for some rebel leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Some international humanitarian groups agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowledge that there are foreigners willing to pay to redeem
slaves can only spur on unscrupulous individuals to make a business
out of redemption," Human Rights Watch officials said in a recent
report. "Unscrupulous middlemen may 'borrow' children who have never
been abducted.... Thus, foreigners intending to do good may be
deceived."</TE>
<TE>   Slavery in Sudan, Africa's largest country, is a byproduct of the
civil war, which has killed an estimated 2 million people--largely
from famine--and driven 4 million from their homes. The conflict pits
the Islamic government in the north against militias in the mainly
Christian and animist south.</TE>
<TE>   Human Rights Watch and other groups say the Khartoum government
provides automatic weapons and support for fighters who attack
southern villages and capture men, women and children of the Dinka
tribe from rebel-controlled areas.</TE>
<TE>   Sudan's government acknowledges that there are abductions in the
country but has denied the existence of slavery. But members of the
U.S.-led slavery commission said they interviewed numerous former
slaves in government- and rebel-held areas in April.</TE>
<TE>   "We are witnessing a resurgence of a set of practices that most
people felt had disappeared," said Penn Kemble, head of the panel
including members from the U.S., Britain, Italy, Norway and France.</TE>
<TE>   "We were quite troubled by the fact that many people in the
international community have treated [the slave problem in Sudan] as
a leftover of a backward society. The problem is real," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The group recommended that Sudan's president, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
Ahmed Bashir, launch a national campaign against slavery.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Kemble said "legitimate concerns" have been
raised about slave redemption. Officials who deny slavery exists can
point to the scam buyback programs "to say that what is happening
here is not actual slavery but some kind of racket," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kemble said his panel was not able to establish how many people
have been abducted and enslaved. Estimates of those held in captivity
range from 14,000 to more than 100,000. Sudan has a population of
about 35 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Swiss-based charity Christian Solidarity International said
that between 1995 and 2001, it redeemed 60,000 Sudanese slaves,
paying $33 to $100 each.</TE>
<TE>   John Eibner, a senior official with the group, said Monday that
Kemble's panel didn't seriously investigate the allegations about
slave redemption programs. CSI, Eibner said, would be undeterred by
Kemble's "hard-line" position against the programs.</TE>
<TE>   "CSI will spare no effort to liberate slaves still in bondage," he
said. "It would be unpardonable to leave women and children enslaved,
subjected daily to unspeakable physical and psychological abuse, in
the absence of a functional alternative."</TE>

<HD>Venezuela  to Let Coup Figure Go</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Venezuela will cooperate with Colombia's decision to grant asylum to
a businessman who became president for a day during a failed coup,
President Hugo Chavez said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez said he will grant safe passage to Pedro Carmona, adding
that he expects the 60-year-old businessman to leave for Colombia "in
the next hours."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to grant safe passage so he can leave Venezuela. We are
obligated to do it," Chavez said during a speech to indigenous
leaders. "We can think what we think, but those are the norms of
international law that we have to respect."</LD>
<TE>   After the coup, Chavez regained power and Carmona was arrested.
Charged with rebellion and conspiracy, Carmona escaped house arrest
Thursday and took refuge in the Colombian Embassy. There, he asked
for political asylum.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope everything goes well for him. In any case, for us ... he's
a fugitive of the law," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona might move to a third country after he gets to Colombia,
his lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Later Monday, another presumed coup leader, Rear Adm. Carlos
Molina Tamayo, applied for political asylum in El Salvador. Molina
made the request because he had received death threats and feared for
his safety, said his lawyer, Carlos Bastidas.</TE>
<TE>   El Salvador is considering Molina's request, the country's Foreign
Ministry said in a statement. Molina took refuge Saturday in the home
of El Salvador's commercial attache, the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Molina, along with four other military officers, had been free,
but he was barred from leaving the country pending trial on charges
of rebellion and conspiracy.</TE>

<HD>Welfare Reform's Enforcers</HD>
<DH>Time is running out for many recipients even as the economy
lags. It's up to caseworkers like Martha Soria to get them off the
rolls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting with the poor, sometimes troubled people who have come for
help, welfare caseworker Martha Soria is a vision of brisk but
attentive efficiency. Those are traits she learned years ago while
working in the travel industry, and are no less useful in Los Angeles
County's vast welfare system.</LD>
<LD>   On this day, she is applying a patient eye to Vicente Granados, a
38-year-old married father of two whose life is falling apart. His
36-year-old wife has been stricken with leukemia, he is out of work
after the steel mill where he had been employed for 12 years closed
down, he's been depressed and admits he's been drinking.</LD>
<LD>   The Granadoses were recently found eligible for public assistance
and their case assigned to Soria. Before 1996, when the nation's
welfare laws were radically altered, such families might have gotten
a monthly welfare check for the rest of their lives. Soria's job
would have been mostly to shuffle their paperwork. But with welfare
reform came time limits on such benefits and strict new work
requirements.</LD>
<TE>   And while Soria still shuffles a lot of paperwork, her job as well
as the jobs of welfare caseworkers across the state and nation have
changed. They have had to master hundreds of new rules and
regulations under welfare reform and take on new responsibilities as
guidance counselor, job finder, cheerleader, taskmaster and sob
sister to people like Vicente Granados.</TE>
<TE>   Front-line workers are the enforcers behind the dramatic declines
in national welfare caseloads, from 5 million families in 1994 to 2.1
million last year.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those declines, though, were made during an economic boom.
Today's more uncertain economy will provide a crucial test as
Congress prepares to renew welfare reform laws. The House of
Representatives recently approved a bill, supported by the Bush
administration, that stiffens work requirements even more. The Senate
will next take up the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Caseworkers are a vital link in welfare reform," said Pamela
Holcomb, a senior researcher at the Washington, D.C.-based Urban
Institute. "When you get down to it, the client and the caseworker
interacting and how good a connection can be made at that basic level
is critical."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, caseworkers are under almost as much pressure as
participants on the job hunt. In Los Angeles, workers have begun to
mail out notices of approaching five-year federal time limits for
cash aid.</TE>
<TE>   About 25 of the 90 families in Soria's caseload could lose partial
benefits as early as January. She has to personally contact each head
of household to remind them of the looming cutoff and the impact it
could have on plans for schooling, counseling and job training. (In
California, only adults will lose the cash grants, while retaining
Medi-Cal and food stamps; children will keep full benefits.)</TE>
<TE>   Caseworkers are very much aware of how their own jobs could become
more stressful if Congress steeply increases work requirements for
welfare recipients. But many also say that welfare reform was a
needed corrective to a system that long fostered dependency.</TE>
<TE>   "There is pressure on people because of the time limit and it's
kind of scary," said Soria, 44, who works out of the county's Rancho
Dominguez office. "But they have had five years to plan for this."</TE>
<TE>   One of her clients is not so sure about the upside of welfare
reform. Lawana Gordon, a 41-year-old mother of four who could be
among the first to lose benefits, worries about whether she and her
two youngest children will make ends meet if that happens. In
addition to the family's monthly cash aid of $443, about a third of
which is Gordon's share, she earns minimum wage working part-time
providing in-home care. She would like to complete training to become
a certified nurse's assistant but feels the time-limit urgency.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems unfair because they don't know my individual situation,
but it's out of my control," said Gordon after meeting with Soria to
discuss her plans.</TE>
<TE>   Soria told Gordon that the county is planning workshops for
recipients in line to lose benefits but that there are few details.
More pressing is getting Gordon an appointment with counselors to
discuss emotional strains brought on by her parents' deaths in recent
years as well as worry over her future.</TE>
<TE>   "I will overcome all of this," Gordon tells Soria. "The most
important thing is protecting my kids, but I'm hanging in there."</TE>
<TE>   To help people like Gordon hang on, Los Angeles County employs
about 1,710 eligibility workers, who do the initial interviews of
welfare applicants and determine the level of aid. Once eligible,
participants are sent to one of 773 case managers, who are paid
between $2,433 and $3,538 a month. Soria was an eligibility worker
for seven years before being promoted to case manager three years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The job used to focus on helping clients receive benefits, Soria
said, adding: "Now we're doing more customer-service work, but at the
same time trying to promote responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Among Soria's expanded chores is to monitor participants'
work--single parents must be engaged in work-related activities for
32 hours each week, a married head of household for 35 hours--and the
progress of clients in approved college classes. To keep up with the
new rules, caseworkers like Soria attend weekly training sessions on
such topics.</TE>
<TE>   A New Client Begins</TE>
<TE>   the Orientation Process</TE>
<TE>   The Granadoses are among the newest of Soria's cases. They are
among the more than 16,000 two-parent households in the county's
welfare caseload, which numbers in excess of 191,000 families.</TE>
<TE>   Vicente Granados is a thin, florid-faced man with a mustache and a
nervous tic. His jaws work strenuously on piece of gum as Soria
explains the process. They sit in Soria's small, tidy office, one of
dozens of similar gray cubicles in the large room that give the space
the appearance of an accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Across her desk, Soria passes paper after paper--some explaining
the welfare program, some his rights and responsibilities--which
Granados must sign. She then sends him to an orientation where he
will see a motivational video, talk about success stories and be
screened to determine his literacy.</TE>
<TE>   After the orientation, Soria intends to assign him to a three-week
program called Job Club, where he'll be provided with a phone and job
listings and be expected go out for interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Because his wife is ill, Granados could get a medical exemption
from working to care for her. But he wants to work and Soria
encourages him because of the financial benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Monthly cash aid for a family of four is less than $600, but
Granados would be able to keep most of his salary from a job, and
depending on his wages, a portion of the cash aid. The county would
also help him obtain the certificate he needs to work a forklift. In
addition, the family would probably qualify to have a county-paid
nurse help out in the home.</TE>
<TE>   With Granados in orientation, Soria attends to the rest of her
day--updating her cases on the computerized system, phoning
participants who might have missed a meeting or failed to turn in
required paperwork, receiving calls from people who want appointments
or just need a word of encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   In many instances, two-parent households like the Granados family
face more barriers than single mothers because they usually are
immigrants with limited English skills. But these are the families
Soria believes she works with best, perhaps because their lives
parallel those of her own kin.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Maria Aurora Cardenas, who is now 80, arrived from
Mexico in the 1960s with six children to care for after her husband
passed away. She had only a second-grade education and still doesn't
speak English very well, though she understands it, Soria says.</TE>
<TE>   Soria wanted to become a flight attendant but she was 2 inches too
short. She settled for a ground job, first as a reservation clerk and
then as a travel agent handling business clients for Aeromexico until
the financially troubled airline laid her off.</TE>
<TE>   She had gone back to school to become an court interpreter when a
friend told her the county welfare office was hiring.</TE>
<TE>   During her first weeks, Soria cried along with the mothers who
recounted how they were homeless or couldn't feed their children. She
almost quit but stuck it out, she says, because her husband had been
laid off and they were buying a house. She has been cursed out,
glared at and insulted by uncooperative welfare participants, but it
all becomes worthwhile, she says, when people later succeed in life
and thank her.</TE>
<TE>   Almost on cue, Soria gets a call from one of her cases, a woman
whose husband is ill and can't work. Soria encouraged her to get a
certificate as a preschool teacher. Often during visits, the woman
would break down, saying she couldn't go on. Now she calls to say she
has gotten a job and a promotion already.</TE>
<TE>   Soria has little time to savor that upbeat moment. Another case is
waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Felisiano V. Salazar Sr. is a 52-year-old man with a 49-year-old
wife at home and three children. Salazar had done odd jobs as a
mechanic and heavy equipment operator but has been out of work since
September. He's already been through Job Club once, with no success.
His English is not very good, and Soria decides to schedule an
assessment to determine if there are other barriers.</TE>
<TE>   "We can probably find him a job, but it's going to take more
effort than with a younger person," Soria says, after sitting Salazar
down with job developer who works in the office.</TE>
<TE>   New System 'Is Difficult for Everybody'</TE>
<TE>   Later in the week, Soria will learn that Salazar for the second
time has missed his appointment for an assessment. Unable to reach
him by phone, she schedules an appointment by mail. Soria then will
have to decide whether Salazar's inaction merits reporting as a
possible infraction, which could cause the family to lose a portion
of its cash aid.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, "workers and participants are caught in a
new system that is difficult for everybody," said Madeleine Stoner, a
USC professor of social work who has examined the county's welfare
program. "There have been computer blips and people have been wrongly
sanctioned. It's been a very dysfunctional system."</TE>
<TE>   Soria, though, thinks the ethos is slowly changing. Many offices
have been revamped, with plush carpeting and new paint intended to
create an atmosphere of professionalism. Both participants and
workers seem to be more cordial, she says.</TE>
<TE>   But with the federal government proposing to keep welfare
funding--about $16.5 billion last year--static and California facing
a projected $17-billion budget shortfall, money for many services is
in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Los Angeles County Department of Public
Social Services, which administers welfare programs, is facing a
$100-million deficit. Although officials hope to avoid layoffs,
vacancies will go unfilled and workloads will increase, Director
Bryce Yokomizo said.</TE>
<TE>   Back in her office, Soria is still grappling with the best way to
help the Granados family. She is ready to schedule the father for Job
Club. Because he indicated he has a drinking problem, he first must
see a substance abuse specialist.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Soria learns that Granados missed his
appointment because his wife had to enter the hospital and he must
baby-sit the children. He told Soria he is trying to decide what
should be a priority: getting the services he needs to provide for
his family or staying home to care for his wife.</TE>
<TE>   In Soria's view, taking a job, with its financial benefits, would
relieve some of the pressure on Granados, "but ultimately he will
have to reflect on that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her own mother almost applied for welfare when Soria was a child.
She was handed reams of paperwork in a language she didn't understand
by workers who were not very sympathetic. So, she walked out, she
told Soria many years later.</TE>
<TE>   Be happy you have the stability of a county job, but, more
important, she told her daughter, be nice.</TE>
<TE>   Those words have guided her, Soria said: "You have to have
compassion in this job. You always have to realize it's very possible
you could be sitting on the other side of the desk."</TE>

<HD>Millions Flow Through Loophole in State Campaign Finance
Law</HD>
<DH>Politics: Herb Wesson and John Burton lead the list, with
$2 million between them.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California legislators are taking advantage of a ruling on the
state's new campaign finance law to raise nearly $3 million in
contributions that exceed donation limits imposed by the voters two
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Leading the scramble are the Legislature's two highest-ranking
officials, Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson of Culver City and Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton of San Francisco, both Democrats.
Burton was the principal author of Proposition 34, the state campaign
finance law that was intended to curb political contributions. It was
placed on the ballot by the state Legislature and then approved by
voters in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Aided by an interpretation of the campaign finance law, Wesson and
Burton say they are obeying its rules even as they have avoided the
$3,000 contribution limit it established for legislators. They have
taken donations of $25,000, $50,000 and in one case $100,000 from
Indian casino operators, labor unions, liquor interests and
corporations.</LD>
<TE>   In Wesson's case, the money has been spent on a variety of
purposes. Among other things, he paid his wife $4,000 for writing
thank-you letters to contributors, and he made $25,000 donations to
other candidates. Those contributions, according to some officials,
may have violated the law.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 34 imposed contribution limits on candidates seeking
state offices. Language in the law states that its purpose was to
"minimize the potentially corrupting influence and appearance of
corruption caused by large contributions."</TE>
<TE>   But the loophole that has allowed lawmakers to accept unlimited
contributions was created by the Fair Political Practices Commission,
the political watchdog whose job includes interpreting and enforcing
campaign finance law. In a September decision that campaign reform
advocates say thwarted the will of the voters, the commission ruled
that Proposition 34 restrictions do not apply to political committees
created by lawmakers before the measure took effect on Jan. 1, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Getman, who chairs the commission, said the ruling was an
attempt to knit together the rules that predated Proposition 34 with
the new limits that the measure imposed.</TE>
<TE>   "While it's wonderful to talk about the philosophy of contribution
limits, we've got to make the law work," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some proponents of campaign finance reform fiercely disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "This is strictly a creation of the FPPC and a mind-boggling one
at that. It's an abomination," said Jim Knox, director of California
Common Cause, a political reform advocacy organization.</TE>
<TE>   In less than a year, according to a Times analysis, Wesson
accepted $1.6 million in contributions whose amounts would have been
prevented by the limits included in Proposition 34. Burton took in
$532,000 in donations above the limit created by the proposition.</TE>
<TE>   Burton and Wesson both said they are complying with the law and
don't believe they have broken faith with voters. In interviews last
week, both said they did not ask for the Fair Political Practices
Commission ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a total surprise, albeit a pleasant surprise," Burton
said.</TE>
<TE>   "As the FPPC went through Proposition 34, they found there were
several adjustments that needed to be made," Wesson said. "So,
everything that I am doing and other members are doing today is
within the parameters of Proposition 34."</TE>
<TE>   The contributions that exceed the limits of Proposition 34 come as
legislators and others are probing allegations of inappropriate
fund-raising by state leaders, most notably Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, a legislative committee has been questioning a
former aide to Davis about accepting a $25,000 check for the
governor's reelection from Oracle Corp. shortly after the state
signed a $95-million software licensing agreement with the company
last May.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also has been criticized for asking a teachers union for a
$1-million donation in the middle of a policy meeting in his office,
and for granting large salary increases to a prison guards union that
is one of his biggest contributors.</TE>
<TE>   Getman, the commission chairwoman, said that one of the knottiest
problems in implementing Proposition 34 was what to do with political
committees created before the measure took effect. The commission
resolved the issue by allowing those committees to continue to raise
money under the old rules, which set no limits on contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The preexisting committees were given termination dates that in
some cases don't take effect until two years after this November's
election. In the meantime, some new restrictions were imposed on
them, Getman said. Lawmakers could not use money from those
committees for direct campaign expenditures such as advertising, but
could use it for indirect expenses such as contributions to local
groups whose endorsement they are seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbents may transfer their contributions to political parties
for party-building activities such as voter registration. Political
parties also may give limited amounts of this "soft" money to
candidates. Critics claim that process merely substitutes an indirect
contribution for a direct donation.</TE>
<TE>   Any contribution made from those older committees to another
candidate would be subject to Proposition 34's $3,000 limit.   On May
17, the commission told Wesson that, under Proposition 34's
restrictions, it is illegal to make contributions to other state
candidates in excess of the limit.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson, citing the exemption for older committees, wants the
commission to reconsider its advice to him. He contributed $25,000
each to Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance), a candidate for
reelection, and Assemblyman Tom Calderon (D-Montebello), who ran an
unsuccessful race for insurance commissioner in March.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like Armageddon but there really are a million
safeguards in this system," Getman said. "The bottom line being it's
not going to be used to get around the Proposition 34 limits for
elections that are held under Proposition 34."</TE>
<TE>   Reform advocates disagreed, charging that the commission had
distorted the decision of the voters.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the most outrageous decision the FPPC has ever made," said
Robert Stern, the co-author of California's landmark campaign finance
law in 1974, who served nine years as general counsel to the Fair
Political Practices Commission. "If you have contribution limits
shouldn't it apply to everybody? The purpose is to reduce the
influence of large contributors on government, and how are you
reducing that influence when you allow Burton and Wesson to take
unlimited amounts of money?"</TE>
<TE>   He said the one exception might be to allow lawmakers to pay off
outstanding debt accrued before the limitations went into effect. But
instead of doing that, he noted that the commission lifted the
limitation for every officeholder with an old committee whether or
not they had debt.</TE>
<TE>   "From start to finish this whole proposition was a sham and
unfortunately the FPPC has become part of it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The questions regarding the use of preexisting committees for
political fund-raising are the latest challenge to the proposition's
effectiveness. Campaign reform advocates have complained that
Proposition 34 did not thwart political giving by so-called
"independent expenditure" committees, which contribute on behalf of
candidates and causes but without giving directly to them.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of tighter finance rules, including leaders of the Los
Angeles Ethics Commission, also complain that Proposition 34 has
allowed the political parties and other organizations, such as labor
unions, to communicate with their members outside the limits imposed
by the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said the Burton proposal, which repealed the much tougher
Proposition 208 approved in 1996 by the voters, was hurriedly put on
the ballot after an appellate court indicated it intended to uphold
Proposition 208.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 34 was approved by the Legislature in 2000 a week
after it was introduced. Only one hearing was held, and opponents of
the plan were not allowed to testify. The measure won the approval of
60% of voters in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Court, advocacy director for the Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights, said lawmakers who accepted the large contributions
should be required to return them because they violated a promise to
the voters.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson collected $100,000 from the Pipes and Trade Council, an
organization of labor unions. Other donations to Wesson included
$50,000 from California First Health Plan and $34,445 from Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   Burton's contributors included the California State Employees
Assn., which gave $75,000. State government attorneys donated
$72,000. A sampling of campaign reports showed that Assembly
Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks accepted no contributions
exceeding the Proposition 34 limit. Senate Republican Leader Jim
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga accepted three contributions of $5,000
each, or a total of $6,000 over the limit. A number of other Assembly
members and state senators also have benefited from contributions to
their existing committees that exceed the Proposition 34 limits.</TE>
<TE>   Brulte said he and Cox originally liked the idea of a loophole,
but later changed their minds. "Our lawyers said their interpretation
of Proposition 34 found that it called for a ban on all large
contributions. Period," Brulte said.</TE>
<TE>   As word spread of the commission ruling last fall, rank and file
members of both parties--and special interests--hustled to invoke the
change. On printed invitations to fund-raising events where a glass
of wine and dinner may cost $10,000, lawmakers typed in a new line:
"There are no limits on contributions to this committee."</TE>

<HD>Single-Gender Schools Gaining Favor, Success</HD>
<DH>Education: Some pupils like segregated classrooms, but
critics say it's not real world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As they sit separated by a hallway, the boys and girls of Jefferson
Leadership Academies in Long Beach don't cite research to explain why
they concentrate, learn and behave. And they don't care whether their
public middle school violates federal law. Something about their
school is working, they say. And if they took classes together, it
wouldn't.</LD>
<LD>   "You can ask your teacher something girlie, and you don't have to
worry about boys saying something cruel," seventh-grader Kiona Jones
said. "It's more open."</LD>
<LD>   Boys at the school acknowledge that the girls would distract them.
In a class of just boys, eighth-grader Jesse Alvarez said, "we still
joke around, but we get our work done."</LD>
<TE>   Educators have debated whether single-sex classrooms make Jesse
more focused and Kiona less timid, but for three decades the question
has been overshadowed by fears that spending public dollars on such
segregated programs would violate federal laws against
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   However, Congress and officials in the Bush administration
recently signaled that single-sex classes should not be confined to
private schools and that revised regulations will lift the legal
cloud. As a result, rare experiments like Jefferson's are expected to
become more common.</TE>
<TE>   "Our effort here is not to say that single-sex education is the
greatest thing since sliced bread," said Brian Jones, general counsel
for the U.S. Department of Education, at a briefing this month.
Rather, he said, the government is encouraging innovation and
flexibility, and will not fund schools that extend advantages to one
gender without offering comparable treatment to the other.</TE>
<TE>   This shift in federal opinion is the most dramatic in the field
since Title IX became law in 1972 to give female students equal
access to education. Along with the offer of millions of dollars in
federal grants for experimental programs, the policy change has
invigorated the single-sex movement--and the debate over whether it
really helps youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   "It says to the local school districts, 'If you'd like to look
into it, don't worry about the lawyers ganging up on you,'" said
Carolyn Colletti of the National Coalition of Girls' Schools.</TE>
<TE>   Educators wanting to develop same-sex programs will likely look to
Jefferson Leadership Academies and the 10 other public schools
nationwide where either one gender is excluded or boys and girls take
all their academic classes apart. An uncounted number of other U.S.
schools separate the genders in only some subjects, such as math and
science.</TE>
<TE>   The voluntary program that Jefferson Principal Jill Rojas designed
three years ago to revamp the low-scoring Long Beach school was an
attractive example even before Washington warmed to single-sex
schooling. For about 1,200 students in grades six through eight,
Jefferson has one faculty, one campus and one cafeteria. Every class
but band is segregated.</TE>
<TE>   While one group of 35 boys studies reading, writing and social
studies, the girls--also in blue and white uniforms--study math and
science across the hall. At midday, they swap. For homeroom, the boys
are assigned to male teachers and the girls to female ones.</TE>
<TE>   "We both have English with Miss Jones. You have it first period, I
have it third period. What's the difference?" Rojas said,
conjecturing why her "separate but equal" model has not been among
those challenged by civil-rights organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents attribute whatever success single-sex schools have
achieved to other advantages: small classes, skilled teachers, active
parents--but not the gender separation. Lack of those extras, they
contend, shortchanges children at less-fortunate schools. And,
critics argue, single-sex schools train students in an environment
too different from the adult world.</TE>
<TE>   "Schools are the workplace of childhood," said Kim Gandy,
president of the National Organization for Women, which joined the
New York chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union to formally
complain about a public high school for girls in Harlem. "If we teach
that boys and girls can't learn together and can't thrive together
... that's not a good lesson for our daughters or our sons."</TE>
<TE>   A coeducational environment, particularly in middle and high
schools, is not "the real world" either, counters Leonard Sax, the
Maryland physician and psychologist who runs the National Assn. for
the Advancement of Single Sex Public Education.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very peculiar and unreal culture in which what counts is
how you look, not who you are," Sax said.</TE>
<TE>   That is precisely why Tina Perry sends her 14-year-old daughter to
Jefferson in the Long Beach Unified School District. Teenagers, Perry
has observed teaching at a Watts middle school, are "hormonal
hoodlums," and putting them all together disrupts learning.</TE>
<TE>   In the coed science classes that Perry teaches, "I just feel like
I waste time knowing who's dating who," so she can keep them apart
during lab projects, she said. High school, however, is not a place
to separate students, Perry believes, so she is sending her daughter
to ninth grade at a school with coed classes.</TE>
<TE>   Educators argue about an array of research on single-sex schools.
The most exhaustive studies were conducted abroad, mostly in England
and Australia, where single-sex public schools are deeply rooted.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the research suggests that same-gender education works
for some students but not all, and that such programs do little or no
harm. Some research concludes single-sex classes are best in
elementary school. Other studies find more benefits in middle and
high school. By some measures, single-sex is worthwhile only for
girls, especially minority girls from low-income homes. Still more
studies suggest that boys benefit too.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no definitive study that says absolutely, positively,
without a doubt the best way to educate kids is single-sex
classrooms. But there's also no definitive study that says
absolutely, positively, without a doubt the best way is coed
classrooms," said Karen Stabiner, the Los Angeles author of "All
Girls: Single-Sex Education and Why It Matters," scheduled for
publication in August by Riverhead Books. The spectrum of opinions
suggests that new single-sex programs in public school districts
won't all look alike, few if any will be mandatory, and most public
schools will remain coed.</TE>
<TE>   The wide-ranging reform bill passed last year by Congress and
signed in January by President Bush directed the Department of
Education to revise its regulations to permit more single-sex
elementary and secondary programs. The department on May 8 opened a
60-day period for public comment.</TE>
<TE>   A 1996 Supreme Court decision that opened the publicly funded
Virginia Military Institute to women left room for exclusive
education programs if "comparable," or equally funded, opportunities
are available to all students.</TE>
<TE>   "'Comparable' doesn't mean the same.... If you have a ballet class
at the girls' school, you don't have to have a ballet class at the
boys' school," said Sax, the advocate for single-sex public
education.</TE>
<TE>   California attracted much attention in the late 1990s for its
experiment with separate academies for boys and girls. When the state
funding ran out, all but one of the six schools closed. Students at
the remaining San Francisco 49ers Academies in East Palo Alto have
improved their grades and behavior and are less likely to skip school
or drop out, the school reports.</TE>
<TE>   At the Jefferson academies in Long Beach, teachers make small
adjustments for differences they perceive in boys' and girls'
development, learning styles and interests.</TE>
<TE>   Boys in Jack Sokoloff's seventh-grade humanities class want to
know more about military battles. In her science class for girls,
Marisela Moreno emphasizes women's contributions to medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Naegele, a seventh-grade humanities teacher, said that in 14
years of teaching at other schools, she never gave boys much credit.
Girls seemed to be doing the deep thinking. When Jefferson boys are
by themselves, she has noticed, "they're willing to say their crazy
ideas, and a lot of their crazy ideas have meat to them."</TE>
<TE>   Outside of Jefferson's classrooms, there are fewer formal
divisions, but students create them. In the cafeteria, girls sit
mostly to the left of the lunch line and boys take the right. The
playground is less segregated.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson's program seems to sit well with most students, but some
grumble. Contrary to studies that show students are more focused in
single-sex classes, Oscar Vasquez, 12, said he would pay better
attention if a girl--at least one he thought was cute--were at the
desk next to him.</TE>
<TE>   "If you didn't know some kind of math and she knew it, you'd
really listen to her," he said. "But with another boy, you'd just
start playing around."</TE>
<TE>   Since Jefferson split into single-gender academies, the school's
overall standardized-test score has improved 16%. Although it is
difficult to isolate the reason among other educational reforms,
increases were achieved in all grades and all subjects by all
ethnicities and both genders.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Jefferson's scores remain well below the state average for
middle schools--although among urban schools with similar
demographics, Jefferson ranks higher. Coming mostly from the
surrounding neighborhood but also elsewhere in Long Beach, more than
80% of the academies' students qualify for free or discounted lunches
because of their families' low incomes. About a third are classified
as still learning English.</TE>
<TE>   "The students think they've done better" because they study in
segregated classes, principal Rojas said. "And that's all I care
about."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It was just a small mistake--one wrong vowel in a young man's name,
an "i" where an "a" should have been. It was not worth fixing.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, that's what the government told Carmen Rocha about
the misspelling of her son Bobby's name on the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial wall in Washington. Instead of Robert Salas Rocha, his name
was inscribed as Robert Silas Rocha.</LD>
<LD>   But to Carmen Rocha, the misspelling was evidence that her country
had forgotten her son, just 19 when he died with three buddies on
reconnaissance in November 1970 on a Vietnamese trail. With his name
misspelled--Carmen's family name--it was as though Bobby wasn't on
the wall at all.</LD>
<TE>   Until this weekend, that is, when the 70-year-old retired Los
Angeles waitress saw with her own eyes--on the long black wall that
chronicles the 58,000 dead from the Vietnam War--that Bobby's name at
last was recorded correctly. Six days ago, in answer to a family
request first made in the 1980s and twice denied, an engraver
corrected the spelling.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Carmen and five family members were guests of the
government in the VIP section for the annual Memorial Day ceremony at
the wall.</TE>
<TE>   They listened as former Sen. Bob Dole referred to "this sacred
place of reflection" and said it is the veterans' "sacrifice, service
and blood that sanctifies this wall."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so glad I came today instead of before," Carmen said softly
after Dole spoke, referring to her first visit to the nation's
capital. "I wouldn't have wanted to come with Bobby's name wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Before the ceremony, Rocha family members placed a large poster in
front of the panel bearing Bobby's name. It included photos of him
and their written memorials. "Dear Bobby, You will be in my heart
from here to eternity," Carmen wrote.</TE>
<TE>   On the wall, Bobby's name was still fresh, the engraving newly
carved, standing out against the other, long-inscribed, names around
it. It is on Panel 5 West, Line 127.</TE>
<TE>   Carmen approached it Sunday in her wheelchair with her son Rudy
pushing her forward. Seeing it for the first time, she at first sat
stoically, sweating under the early afternoon sun but showing no
outward emotion. She held a bouquet of irises and gave them to her
13-year-old grandson, Nicolas, to lay before Bobby's name.</TE>
<TE>   Then she rose to touch the engraving. Forcing her bad knees to
lift her out of the wheelchair, she traced a line with her finger
from the panel that had Bobby's misspelled name to the adjacent panel
with the name properly spelled.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's good the government decided to fix it," she said.
"If someone died for their country, he should at least have his name
spelled correctly."</TE>
<TE>   The family first learned of the misspelling in the 1980s, and then
only when someone saw it on the scaled-down mobile wall that tours
the country. An appeal to the government then and another in the
early 1990s failed. Both times, officials responded by noting that
they only correct "gross misspellings" in the names on the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Orange County attorney Tom Umberg--a Vietnam War vet
and colonel in the Army Reserves--saw Bobby's dog tag in the Los
Alamitos Army Reserve office of Rosie Rocha, Bobby's sister and an
Army master sergeant. She told Umberg the story, and he began
behind-the-scenes arm-twisting in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a mistake that couldn't stand," Umberg said last week in
his Irvine office. "I'm happy the U.S. government, albeit way too
late, finally properly honored the sacrifice made by the Salas Rocha
family."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Greilsamer, spokesman for the Vietnam Memorial Fund that paid
for the change, said, "It was one of those things where it wasn't a
gross misspelling, but it was appropriate to make the change."</TE>
<TE>   Back in her hotel Sunday after the first visit to the wall, Carmen
revealed a secret: "You don't know how hard I prayed this morning
that I would not break down."</TE>
<TE>   She also prayed that Rudy, now 53 and Bobby's older brother, would
find peace after seeing the wall. Thinking that Rudy still harbored
some older-brother guilt for Bobby volunteering to follow him to
Vietnam, Carmen said, "I didn't want him to see me cry. I prayed to
God not to have an emotional reaction."</TE>
<TE>   Rudy, a Los Angeles mail carrier, smiled at his mother's concern.
"I've had 31 years to think about things," he said. "I'm OK now."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was a weekend replete with memories. Carmen recalled
Bobby telling her not to worry about him. Before he left for Vietnam,
he laid out a row of several matchsticks, then a second row with only
one match. "This is destiny, and this is me," he told her, pointing
to the two rows. "If God wants me to cross over, I will."</TE>
<TE>   The teeming crowds at the wall and the uncomfortable heat on
Sunday had made it difficult to secure a private moment, Carmen said.
Sometime later, she said after her visit, "I will take time to talk
to Bobby."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Carmen said she believes Bobby would be proud of
the family's effort to challenge the bureaucracy--and of the eventual
correcting of his name. She hoped the weekend might close another
chapter in the family's effort to make peace with his death.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like it's ever going to have an ending," Carmen said.
"Bobby's around here somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   With a smile, she added: "He can take the heat better than me."</TE>

<HD>On a Bridge That Wasn't</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: A driver recalls the feeling of 'nothing under me'
in the collapse. Seven bodies have been found so far.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEBBERS FALLS, Okla.</DL>
<LD>The sun was at his back, the humidity was rising and Rodney Tidwell
had the cruise control set at 70 mph as he headed west Sunday morning
on Interstate 40, bound for Reno with a truckload of hoses. Then he
was falling.</LD>
<LD>   "There just wasn't nothing under me," the 35-year-old truck driver
said Monday, a blue cap covering cuts in his scalp and his arm in a
sling to protect several broken ribs.</LD>
<LD>   Down he went, 62 feet, to the brown-green Arkansas River, then a
few feet more before the cab of his 18-wheeler settled into the silt.
That's the last thing the father of three from Ripley, Miss.,
remembers.</LD>
<TE>   Tidwell was one of the few motorists crossing the bridge shortly
before 8 a.m. who had luck on his side. He appears to have freed
himself from the crushed cab of his truck and a fisherman competing
in a bass tournament helped drag him to shore.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps a dozen motorists died after a barge rammed pilings
holding up the bridge, collapsing nearly 600 of its 1,988 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers hauled a fourth body, that of a woman, from the
water Monday afternoon before halting their work because of
thunderstorms. In early evening, the search resumed and divers pulled
out three more victims.</TE>
<TE>   Hampered by visibility of less than a foot and strong
currents--even after spillways were closed upstream to slow the
flow--divers employed sonar in an effort to map the scene and locate
bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, investigators from numerous state and federal agencies,
including the National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI,
sought to determine what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic was rerouted off the South's primary east-west
thoroughfare, sending truckers, commuters and holiday travelers as
much as 30 miles out of their way. The new routes weaved through tiny
towns with names such as Gore and Sallisaw, bringing gridlock unheard
of in the rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic on the state's primary inland waterway also was halted
indefinitely in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Business boomed at some gas stations and convenience stores that
have always been just off the beaten I-40 path, while many on the
interstate but beyond the detour signs were all but empty. State
officials, who hope to have the bridge rebuilt in six months, said
they were uncertain how much the disaster will cost.</TE>
<TE>   But with warnings going out to travelers to avoid eastern
Oklahoma, and with major trucking companies rerouting drivers, the
economic damage seems likely to be great.</TE>
<TE>   It is almost certain to affect western Arkansas and perhaps other
states on both the highway and waterway.</TE>
<TE>   "The flow of commerce is on our minds and we don't want to
interrupt it for too long," said Coast Guard Lt. Natalie Magnino.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday began as a bright, warm day, with holiday traffic on the
bridge estimated to be up 50%, to 30,000 vehicles per day. The
tugboat, the Robert Y. Love, was headed north with two 495-foot-long
barges to be filled with petroleum products.</TE>
<TE>   About 7:40 a.m., 30-year veteran tug pilot Joe Dedmon spoke with
some of his seven crew members and lined his vessel up to pass
through one of the river's boat channels.</TE>
<TE>   The crew members then departed the wheelhouse, investigators say.
The craft was pushing upriver about 5 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Tidwell was cruising westward, as was Kay Blandford of Southerland
Springs, Texas. She was heading home from a rodeo in Fort Smith,
Ark., just 20 miles back, following two friends in another vehicle.
Her friends were towing a trailer with four horses aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Truck driver James Bilyeau of Conway, Ark., was just ahead,
heading east.</TE>
<TE>   The barge began sliding westward, out of the channel, at 7:43 a.m.
Investigators say Dedmon, 61, may have suffered a stroke or other
ailment and appears to have passed out at the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary tests showed he had not been using drugs or alcohol.
He was still hospitalized Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Before any of Dedmon's crew members realized what was happening,
it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   The massive barge took out three of the bridge's 12 support
pilings. Hundreds of tons of concrete and steel collapsed with such a
roar that fishermen and neighbors for more than a mile in every
direction thought there had been an explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Several vehicles dropped with the concrete.</TE>
<TE>   Max and Goldie Alley of Broken Arrow, Okla., plummeted 40 feet in
their Dodge Dakota pickup, landing on a slab of the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   From their vantage point--he with crushed vertebrae and she with
broken ribs--the couple watched as car after car sailed off the
precipice into the water, landing on top of those that preceded them.</TE>
<TE>   Tidwell, the Reno-bound truck driver, scrambled out of his seat
belt. In seven years of driving professionally, he said he'd never
once worn it until Sunday. He had no idea why he put it on, but "it
saved my life." The fisherman sloshed to his aid.</TE>
<TE>   Two other fishermen pulled Bilyeau from his cab. "He was in really
bad shape," said Randy Graham. "I don't know how he hung on like he
did. I said, 'You're all right. We got you.'"</TE>
<TE>   Bilyeau remained hospitalized Monday but had called his rescuers
to thank them.</TE>
<TE>   Blandford spent much of Sunday and Monday in this tiny town, where
friends and relatives of the missing gathered at City Hall, hoping
for miracles.</TE>
<TE>   Over and over, she dialed her friends' cell phone. No one
answered.</TE>
<TE>   A truck matching the one they were driving went into the water, a
witness told police.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers pulled the carcasses of three horses out of the
river on Sunday. And on Monday, someone called the state police to
report the body of another horse floating in the river downstream.</TE>

<LD>   Efforts to right and fully sink a retired Navy ship resumed after
a three-day delay due to high wind and seas.</LD>
<TE>   The 510-foot Spiegel Grove sank upside-down May 17, hours before
it was to be scuttled as an artificial reef and diving attraction.</TE>
<TE>   The ship is in about 130 feet of water, its stern on the bottom
but its bow protruding from the ocean six miles off Key Largo.</TE>
<TE>   Workers expect to use several lift bags and buoyancy in the ship's
ballast to roll it onto its right side so they can sink it
completely. Two tugboats will haul on heavy chains attached to the
ship to help roll it over.</TE>

<HD>Stomach Cancer Doesn't Like Broccoli Either, Researchers
Discover</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Bad news for those who can't stomach broccoli: New research suggests
that it is especially good for the stomach.</LD>
<LD>   A compound found in broccoli and broccoli sprouts appears to be
more effective than modern antibiotics against the bacteria that
cause peptic ulcers. Moreover, tests in mice suggest the compound
offers formidable protection against stomach cancer--the second most
common form of cancer worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   If human tests confirm the findings, a daily snack of tangy
broccoli sprouts could become a medically desirable
staple--especially in Asia, where the ulcer bacteria and stomach
cancer occur in epidemic proportions.</LD>
<TE>   The study, led by scientists at Johns Hopkins University, is the
latest in a 10-year series on broccoli's cancer-fighting potential.</TE>
<TE>   It started in 1992, when Hopkins pharmacology professor Paul
Talalay and his colleagues showed that sulforaphane--a substance
produced in the body from a compound in broccoli--could trigger the
production of phase II enzymes. The enzymes can detoxify
cancer-causing chemicals and are among the most potent anti-cancer
compounds known.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists had known for years that cancer is less common in
people who eat more vegetables, but the broccoli studies were among
the first to point to a particular chemical that might account for
much of that protection.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent studies found that sulforaphane could prevent breast
and colon cancer and other tumors in mice. Then Talalay's team found
that the key compound in broccoli (a chemical called glucoraphanin,
which the body turns into sulforaphane) is at least 20 times more
concentrated in 3-day-old broccoli sprouts than in broccoli.</TE>
<TE>   A single ounce of sprouts has as much glucoraphanin as a pound and
a quarter of cooked broccoli, offering a simpler--and less
flatulent--means of consuming potentially healthful quantities of the
protective agent.</TE>
<TE>   Talalay and co-worker Jed W. Fahey founded a company to make the
sprouts for grocery stores and began testing the effects of
sulforaphane on the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. The microbe, found
globally but especially in Asia, causes ulcers and increases a
person's risk of getting gastric cancer as much as sixfold.</TE>
<TE>   Fahey said the study arose after he learned that two employees at
a broccoli sprout facility with long-standing ulcers had apparently
been cured after they took up snacking on the sprouts.</TE>
<TE>   Working with researchers from the National Scientific Research
Center in Nancy, France, the team found that sulforaphane easily
kills H. pylori , a microbe that is notoriously difficult to
eradicate even with combinations of two or three antibiotics. In test
tube studies, it even killed H. pylori that had burrowed into human
stomach lining cells, as the microbe often does to escape attack.</TE>
<TE>   In separate studies involving mice given a chemical known to cause
stomach cancer, mice pre-treated with sulforaphane had 39% fewer
tumors.</TE>
<TE>   The findings, to be published in today's online edition of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, doesn't mean
broccoli can cure ulcers or prevent stomach cancer in people.</TE>
<TE>   "One question is, would you have to eat a ton of broccoli a day to
get enough of this to be effective?" said Frank Gonzalez of the
National Cancer Institute.</TE>
<TE>   But Fahey said he is optimistic. "The levels that are effective
[in test tubes] are levels that could be achieved by eating a serving
or so of broccoli sprouts, based on the chemistry we know," Fahey
said Talalay said the group is preparing to start a clinical trial in
Japan to test the sprouts' effectiveness in people infected with H.
pylori. About 80% of Japanese adults harbor the microbe in their
stomachs--one reason that gastric cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer
in Japanese women and No. 2 after lung cancer in Japanese men.</TE>
<TE>   The microbe is similarly common in parts of the world where
antibiotics are unavailable or unaffordable, Talalay said.</TE>
<TE>   "Gratifyingly, this is a dietary approach," he said, "which is the
only approach feasible or practical if you want to knock down the
incidence of this very serious disease in the parts of the world
where it is most prevalent."</TE>

<HD>A Burning Cross May Get Justices' Attention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Four years ago, the Ku Klux Klan gathered on a farm in rural
southwestern Virginia for an old-fashioned summer evening of singing
hymns and spewing hate.</LD>
<LD>   One speaker told of his wish to use a high-powered rifle to "shoot
the blacks and the Mexicans." Another ranted about then-President
Clinton and his wife, Hillary. The night was capped by the singing of
"Amazing Grace" and the lighting of a 30-foot cross, easily visible
from a nearby state highway.</LD>
<LD>   A county sheriff, who was there observing the rally, then calmly
informed Klansman Barry Elton Black that he was under arrest for
violating the state's 50-year-old law against cross burning.</LD>
<TE>   Virginia's law, like those of at least a dozen other states,
including California, makes it a crime to burn a cross or display a
swastika for the purpose of "intimidating" or "terrorizing" others.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Virginia Supreme Court joined the growing trend in
state courts when it threw out the klansman's conviction and struck
down the law as a violation of the 1st Amendment right to free
speech.</TE>
<TE>   "Under our system of government, people have the right to use
symbols to communicate," the Virginia judges said in a 4-3 ruling.
"They may patriotically wave the flag or burn it in protest; they may
reverently worship the cross or burn it as an expression of bigotry."</TE>
<TE>   This week, the Supreme Court is being urged to take up the
cross-burning case and to preserve the state laws against displays of
bigotry and hatred.</TE>
<TE>   In his appeal, Virginia Atty. Gen. Jerry Kilgore called cross
burning a kind of "domestic terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, courts in Maryland, New Jersey and South Carolina
have invalidated their cross-burning laws. They have done so even in
cases in which young skinheads burned crosses on the property of
African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, the rulings illustrate the continuing legal dispute
over how to draw a line between protected free speech and illegal
threats and intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, a burning cross--standing alone and without
explanation--is typically understood in our society as a message of
intimidation," Kilgore said. "This is so, regardless of the race,
religion or other characteristics of the individual targeted."</TE>
<TE>   In his appeal, he noted that the state court ruling also threw out
charges against two Virginia Beach men who burned a cross outside the
home of a black family that had just moved into the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer joined his counterparts in
Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oklahoma, Utah and
Washington in urging the high court to take up Virginia's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Lockyer's office say prosecutors in California have
brought 24 charges under the cross-burning law since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Virginia law, however, California's measure is limited
to those who "burn or desecrate a cross or other religious symbol ...
on the private property of another" for the "purpose of terrorizing"
others. This exempts those who burn a cross on their own property.</TE>
<TE>   The justices may act on the appeal in the case, Commonwealth of
Virginia vs. Black, 01-1107, as soon as this week.</TE>
<TE>   If the court turns down Virginia's appeal, it would suggest that
all the cross-burning laws, including California's, are vulnerable to
constitutional challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the dispute turns on the meaning of a Supreme Court ruling
10 years ago that struck down a cross-burning ordinance in St. Paul,
Minn. A teenage skinhead, identified only as R.A.V., had been
convicted of burning a cross outside the home of a black family, but
his lawyers challenged the ordinance as unconstitutional. Agreeing,
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the government cannot "impose
special prohibitions" on expressions of "disfavored subjects."</TE>
<TE>   Scalia's opinion in R.A.V. vs. St. Paul seemed to target political
correctness, and it was used as a basis for striking down campus
speech codes that banned the use of certain demeaning words and
offensive expressions.</TE>
<TE>   It has been unclear, however, whether his opinion was intended to
strike down all cross-burning laws or only those targeting acts
motivated by racial or religious bigotry.</TE>
<TE>   The state courts in California, Florida and Washington took the
latter view and upheld their cross-burning laws against free-speech
attacks, despite the Supreme Court's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The cross-burning case is not the only one that raises the
difficult issue of how to draw a line between protected free speech
and illegal threats and intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco split 6 to 5 on whether antiabortion extremists could be
sued and forced to pay millions of dollars in damages for having
drawn up "wanted posters" that display the names and faces of
abortion doctors. Some doctors who were slain were crossed out.</TE>
<TE>   The six judges in the majority said these posters were intended
"to intimidate physicians from providing reproductive health
services." Because the posters "amounted to a true threat," they are
"not protected speech," wrote Judge Pamela A. Rymer for the appeals
court.</TE>
<TE>   The five dissenters conceded the posters were intended to
intimidate abortion doctors and even frighten them into changing
their practices. However, they said the "wanted posters" were not
true threats because no one had directly targeted an individual for
immediate violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Some forms of intimidation enjoy constitutional protection,"
wrote Judge Alex Kozinski in dissent.</TE>
<TE>   The issue itself is one of the oldest in 1st Amendment law.</TE>
<TE>   In 1919, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously observed that
words that present a "clear and present danger" to incite lawbreaking
are outside the protections of the 1st Amendment. Holmes spoke for a
unanimous court in upholding the conviction of a Socialist Party
leader who printed leaflets that condemned the World War I draft.</TE>
<TE>   But years later, the court gave the "clear and present danger"
test more teeth.</TE>
<TE>   In 1931, the high court threw out the conviction of Yetta
Stromberg, who had been charged with violating California's "red
flag" law. She carried a Soviet flag at a children's camp of the
Young Communist League, but the Supreme Court said the 1st Amendment
protects such political expression.</TE>
<TE>   Free-speech protection reached its broadest point in 1969, the
last year of the Earl Warren court. The justices threw out the
conviction of a Ku Klux Klan leader named Clarence Brandenburg after
his racist rantings were shown on a Cincinnati television station. He
was charged with violating Ohio's criminal conspiracy law, but the
Supreme Court ruled that the 1st Amendment shields political or
racist rantings up to the point where they are likely to "produce
imminent lawless action."</TE>
<TE>   The "Brandenburg test" is still the law, and the dissenters in the
"wanted posters" case cited it as a reason why the damages verdict
against the antiabortion extremists should have been struck down.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 1969, the Supreme Court made its only direct ruling on the
issue of threats. During a Vietnam War protest at the Washington
Monument, an 18-year-old who had just received a draft notice
announced, "If they ever make me carry a rifle, the first man I want
to get in my sights is LBJ."</TE>
<TE>   He was charged with threatening President Johnson, but the Supreme
Court ruled that his comment was a "kind of political hyperbole," not
a true threat.</TE>
<TE>   Some 1st Amendment scholars are hoping the Supreme Court will take
up the cross-burning case or the wanted posters case to clarify the
law on intimidation and threats.</TE>
<TE>   "What we do not have from the court is a clear definition of a
true threat," said University of Virginia law professor Robert M.
O'Neil. "At some point, they need to clarify that issue."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neil said he favors a rule that would require threats to be
"face-to-face and personalized." That would, for example, shield most
cross burners as well as the antiabortion activists who displayed the
wanted posters, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Rodney Smolla at the University of Richmond Law School
joined with the Virginia Civil Liberties Union in challenging the
cross-burning law in the klansman's case.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a classic 1st Amendment problem, because the law takes a
symbol and makes it illegal because of its message," Smolla said.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed that "hoodlums going on someone's lawn can be
prosecuted," but not under a broadly worded law against cross
burning.</TE>
<TE>   But he too hopes the high court will take up the issue of threats
and intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1st Amendment law, we have never worked out the problem of how
to separate a genuine, clear threat to harm someone from a threat or
intimidating statement that is uttered in a political or social
protest," Smolla said. "But the context counts, because some threats
can and do ripen into violence."</TE>

<HD>Prospects Dimming for Post-Enron Reform Legislation</HD>
<DH>Congress: Business opposition has stalled bills on
accounting and pension issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Stiffened opposition from leading business groups has helped stall
the legislative reform drive that emerged from the financial collapse
of Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Despite high-profile hearings that Congress convened earlier this
year, prospects are dimming that lawmakers will complete work on
bills addressing accounting and pension issues raised by the
company's failure.</LD>
<LD>   "It is unlikely that we will get strong reform unless there is a
new event that captures the [public] imagination," said Sen. Jon
Corzine (D-N.J.), who is among those pushing for the legislation.</LD>
<TE>   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) last
week pulled a measure he wrote that would reform accounting practices
after it appeared it would not win the panel's approval. And Senate
Democratic leaders, fearing they lack the votes for passage, have not
brought to the floor pension reform legislation that cleared another
Senate committee two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see them pull back like that ... it means they know they
have problems on their side of the aisle, not just with Republicans,"
said Bruce Josten, executive vice president for government affairs at
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of the groups opposing the
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Senate Democrats can revive these struggling bills,
lawmakers would face the daunting task of reconciling them with more
industry-friendly plans that the House approved earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, at the height of the focus on Enron's troubles
earlier this year, proposed both pension and accounting reforms. But
so far, legislative sources say, the White House has played virtually
no role in trying to resolve the disputes in Congress or force
legislation to the president's desk.</TE>
<TE>   And while the enormous attention to the Enron scandal provided a
strong tailwind for change, that momentum has ebbed as other events
have crowded out the story from the headlines. Now, supporters and
opponents of the reform legislation agree, the underlying current of
business opposition that blocked action on some of these issues for
years has reasserted itself.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like things are in slow motion," said Ann Yerger,
director of research at the Council of Institutional Investors, a
shareholder rights group.</TE>
<TE>   For Senate Democratic leaders, the slowdown follows a familiar
pattern. Though they had hoped the Enron-inspired bills would help
them sharpen distinctions with Republicans and the White House, their
initiatives have been stymied by resistance from centrists and
conservatives within their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Said Corzine: "We have a very close balance of power in the
Congress ... and that makes it very tough to draw sharp distinctions
and move with real reform, whether it is prescription drug benefits
or dealing with Social Security or in this particular case, dealing
with financial reform."</TE>
<TE>   That's apparent on both the pension and accounting fronts.</TE>
<TE>   Enron workers who invested heavily in the company through their
401(k) plans saw their retirement savings wiped out when the stock
collapsed. Responding to that, the Senate Health, Education Labor and
Pension Committee approved legislation in March that would make it
less likely workers would be as dependent on their company's stock
for retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, sponsored by committee chairman Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.), companies could offer their own stock either as a
matching contribution or as an investment option, but not both.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups have charged that such restrictions would
encourage companies to simply drop their matching contributions to
retirement plans. A bill the House passed contains no such limits;
the measure instead would give employees new rights to sell company
stock and diversify investments in their 401(k) retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill cleared Kennedy's committee on an 11-10 party-line
vote. Senate insiders say it lacks the 60 votes it would take to
break a filibuster, and may even be short of the 50 votes it would
need for a simple majority. As a result, Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) hasn't scheduled the legislation for a vote.</TE>
<TE>   "At present," one Democratic source said flatly, "Kennedy's bill
can't pass."</TE>
<TE>   Accounting reform is also struggling to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the House passed a bill that would limit the freedom of
accounting firms to provide other consulting services to the
companies they audit. The measure also would establish a new
regulatory organization to oversee the accounting industry.</TE>
<TE>   Many investor groups and accounting watchdogs blasted the measure
as insufficient. "The House version is much weaker than we would be
looking for," said Yerger, of the institutional investors group.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Sarbanes circulated legislation that would
impose tougher accounting regulations.</TE>
<TE>   It also would require corporate chief executives to personally
certify the accuracy of their company's audit report. If a company
was forced to significantly restate its earnings, executives could be
forced to forfeit bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes planned to move the bill out of his committee last week.
But it ran into intense opposition not only from accounting groups,
but lobby groups such as the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, which sent out an "action call" urging its members to
oppose the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "While being touted as an 'Enron reform bill,' it is in reality an
excuse to create new bureaucracies, substitute government
intervention in place of informed market decision-making and open the
door to ... lawsuits," charged chamber leader Thomas J. Donohue. He
warned Sarbanes' bill would "raise costs, slow growth and inhibit job
creation."</TE>
<TE>   Against such opposition, Sarbanes postponed his committee's
consideration of the bill. Democratic sources said the bill lacked
support from three Democrats on the committee.</TE>
<TE>   That would have given opponents more than enough votes to kill the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes is now negotiating with committee members--and trying to
sort through 123 amendments filed on his proposal. Some reform
supporters fear that even if he can secure majority support, Sarbanes
will be forced to significantly dilute the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Other reform advocates remain optimistic that the pension and
accounting changes may still prove difficult to vote against if bills
reach the Senate floor, especially as the November election nears.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people want to snipe at things in committee. It's a
different matter when it comes to the floor," said Damon Silvers, an
associate general counsel at the AFL-CIO. "At the end of the day a
similar dynamic will take hold in the Senate that did in the House:
People will want to pass something."</TE>

<LD>Fire crews thinned and burned trees near a highway Monday, hoping to
cut off fuel to a 17,600-acre wildfire that had crept within a
half-mile of 175 Mt. Lemmon homes.</LD>
<LD>   One firefighter was injured by a falling tree and was airlifted to
a hospital. He was treated for minor injuries and released.</LD>
<LD>   About 100 residents were evacuated Sunday as high wind hampered
firefighters battling the blaze in the Coronado National Forest.</LD>
<TE>   The fire hadn't damaged any structures but it had the potential to
threaten all 700 homes and 15 businesses, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Mt. Lemmon Highway could remain closed for up to a week, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The road is the only good place to stop the fire," said Heidi
Schewel, a Coronado National Forest spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials said there is a 75% chance the cleared
area along the highway will stop the fire, which was 40% contained on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Those evacuated were mostly full-time residents, said Dean
Barnella, chief of the Mt. Lemmon Fire Department. The rest of the
home and cabin owners in the area are part-time residents who either
weren't there or left earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   The Pima County Board of Supervisors has declared a state of
emergency, making the county eligible for government aid.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was first spotted May 21 and is believed to be
human-caused.</TE>
<TE>   In New Mexico, a wildfire burning in the rugged Pecos Wilderness
of the Santa Fe National Forest and on private land had scorched
12,500 acres by Monday. Firefighters had contained 35% of the blaze
and got a break Monday from higher humidity.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, first reported Wednesday, is burning mixed conifer and
aspen trees.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, with the increased humidity, we are not getting the
kind of heat that we [were] getting previously," said Cathie
Schmidlin, a fire information officer.</TE>

<HD>Victims of 9/11 Memorialized</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Those who died in attacks are honored alongside
veterans for being 'on the front line.'</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SHANKSVILLE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>On a holiday normally reserved for remembering the nation's war dead,
victims of the Sept. 11 attacks were given a place of honor alongside
soldiers who died in battle.</LD>
<LD>   Memories of the attacks made this Memorial Day particularly
painful--and poignant.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of people on Monday visited the western Pennsylvania
field where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed after an apparent
struggle between hijackers and passengers.</LD>
<TE>   Ernie Philips, 38, a Navy commander from Woodbridge, Va., who was
in the Pentagon when it was struck by another hijacked jet, stopped
at the crash site near Shanksville with his wife and two children
during a trip home from Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "These folks, in my mind, saved so many lives," said Philips,
standing by a chain-link fence draped with flags, poems and flowers.
"They were on the front line. The enemy was right there."</TE>
<TE>   Army veteran Jay Brunot, 67, and his wife, Jean, 66, traveled to
the site after attending a holiday parade in Latrobe, about 40 miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole day is supposed to be a recognition of those who died
to protect us," Jay Brunot said. Flight 93 passengers, his wife
added, "were just as important as the veterans were."</TE>
<TE>   Other Sept. 11 victims were remembered in ceremonies Monday around
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   From the deck of a World War II-era aircraft carrier, New York
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg dropped a wreath into the Hudson River to
honor Americans who lost their lives in times of war.</TE>
<TE>   "Do not turn Memorial Day into just a three-day weekend,"
Bloomberg said during the ceremony aboard the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone to way too many funerals over the last several months,"
he said. "We will get over this, but we will never forget. We will
not let their lives be lost in vain."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of veterans observed a moment of silence after a chaplain
blessed the military for protecting America from "all those who
threaten Lady Liberty's torch of eternal vigilance and hope."</TE>
<TE>   In Burlington, Mass., about 150 residents gathered in a light rain
to dedicate a memorial to three men with ties to the Boston suburb
who were aboard American Airlines Flight 11 when it struck the World
Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Evil tried to obliterate us, but it didn't. The World Trade
Center may have been struck down, but we were not destroyed," said
Cheryl McGuinness, whose husband, Thomas, was a co-pilot on the
doomed flight.</TE>
<TE>   The brick memorial honoring McGuinness, Jay Hayes and James
Trentini bears a plaque that reads: "Always Flying High. September
11, 2001. Never to be Forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   The attacks also loomed large in more traditional Memorial Day
celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Tibbetts, pilot of the plane that dropped the world's first
atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, encouraged a crowd of about 9,000 in
Roswell, Ga., to encourage U.S. soldiers overseas with e-mails and
letters.</TE>
<TE>   "Our future now rests in the hands of those people who are over in
Afghanistan and that area," Tibbetts, 89, told the crowd. "It's going
to be a long, hard fight."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Shoars, a retired Green Beret who lives in Spotsylvania,
Va., said he senses a national pride that wasn't evident when he was
serving in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "It's completely different," he said. "In our country, we've had a
lot of calm Memorial Day weekends where we never even looked back. We
need to honor our deceased veterans, all veterans, and now all
people."</TE>
<TE>   In Timonium, Md., six names of people killed in the attack on the
Pentagon were added to the Children of Liberty Memorial, dedicated in
1990 to Maryland military personnel killed by terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The name of Staff Sgt. Walter "Trae" Cohee of Mardela Springs,
Md., also was added. Cohee was killed Jan. 20 when the helicopter he
was riding in crashed outside the Afghanistan capital of Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew my son was going to be something special, but I never
dreamed that he would receive this much attention," said his mother,
Jeanne Cohee.</TE>

<HD>3 Astronauts' Long Space Odyssey Finally to End</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>They missed out on Christmas and New Year's celebrations, Easter
services, their wives and children's birthday parties and, now,
Memorial Day picnics.</LD>
<LD>   After six months aboard the International Space Station, an
exceptionally long time by NASA standards, astronauts Daniel Bursch
and Carl Walz and cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko are more than ready to
return to their home planet and savor Earth's summer.</LD>
<LD>   Space shuttle Endeavour is due to lift off Thursday to pick them
up and drop off their replacements.</LD>
<TE>   In the 41 years that astronauts have been rocketing into space,
only one other American has spent so much time aloft in a single
shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the challenges are more mental and psychological,"
observes Bursch, the father of four.</TE>
<TE>   Walz says he and his roommates have gotten along "tremendously
well," a pleasant surprise considering "how hard it is to be in one
place with just three people for six months." He sometimes retreats
to an empty chamber to play the space station's keyboard and guitar,
and to get away by himself.</TE>
<TE>   Bursch, Walz and Onufrienko should have been back on Earth by now.
Their mission, which began Dec. 5, was extended so Endeavour's
visiting astronauts could fix the space station's balky robot arm.
NASA needed an extra month to prepare for the 12-day flight.</TE>
<TE>   NASA never would have kept the astronauts in orbit for so long
without their enthusiastic agreement, says Bill Gerstenmaier, the
space station program's deputy manager. "This was not mandatory by
any stretch of the imagination," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Russians, who think nothing of keeping cosmonauts up
for a year, NASA prefers to limit flights to about six months,
primarily because of concern over bone and muscle deterioration and
radiation exposure. All three space station men are in their 40s.</TE>
<TE>   The current U.S. space endurance record is held by Shannon Lucid,
whose 1996 mission on the old Russian space station Mir spanned 188
days. (She also holds the world record for women.) The world champion
is Valery Polyakov, a Russian doctor whose Mir mission lasted a
remarkable 438 days in 1994 and 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Bursch and Walz will miss Lucid's mark by just several hours. A
one-day delay in either their launch or landing, however, will propel
them into NASA's record books.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great," says Lucid, now working as NASA's chief
scientist. "I'm just surprised it's taken this long."</TE>

<HD>Batting .000 on New Ballparks</HD>
<DH>Sports: Plans for a new facility in St. Louis fall apart
over public financing, another sign the frenzied U.S. stadium boom is
bust.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>This is a fanatical baseball town. But when the much-loved Cardinals
asked taxpayers here and across Missouri to pitch in for a pricey new
stadium, the response was stony.</LD>
<LD>   Proposals for a $346-million ballpark to replace the team's aging
downtown home collapsed this month when state lawmakers refused to
commit public funds.</LD>
<LD>   "People and the Legislature had this preconceived idea that it was
corporate welfare for billionaire owners and millionaire players,"
said Jeff Rainford, the mayor's chief of staff.</LD>
<TE>   It's a sound bite that's likely to echo in city after city these
days.</TE>
<TE>   The frenzied ballpark boom of the 1990s, which saw taxpayers
contribute big bucks to build major league baseball stadiums in a
dozen cities from Seattle to Baltimore, appears to have come to a
crashing halt. Sports facilities proposed for New Jersey,
Philadelphia, Minneapolis, San Diego and now St. Louis have stalled
in recent years due to concerns about public financing.</TE>
<TE>   As Mark Ganis, a consultant on several stadium deals, put it:
"Government officials are getting tougher."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, deals for new sports arenas are still being negotiated
around the country. And there are still examples of lavish giveaways,
most notably in Illinois, where state and local officials agreed last
year to put up $400 million toward a Chicago Bears football stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Such subsidies, however, "are now the exception, not the rule," a
dramatic change from just three or four years ago, said Ganis,
president of SportsCorp Ltd., a Chicago consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   The new model looks more like what's happening in Los Angeles,
where Mayor James K. Hahn has vowed not to put public funds at risk
for a proposed pro football stadium downtown. (The developers have
asked the city to issue $100 million in bonds to help them buy land;
they promise to pay it all back with ticket and property taxes once
an NFL team is in town.)</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be the last one to say that we won't have any more new
stadiums built, because people like new things and people like
sports," said Mark Rosentraub, an economist who has spent a decade
studying, and often criticizing, public financing of stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think we're going to see a much more prudent, much more
jaundiced view of the numbers, of how much the team can contribute
and what percentage the public should bear. And if those numbers
don't add up, then legislatures and city councils are not going to
approve the deals," said Rosentraub, a dean at Cleveland State
University in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The caution comes, in part, because government budgets are tighter
now than they've been in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   In Missouri, new luxury boxes for the Cardinals were a tough sell
when the state was so short of money that it had to stop sending out
income tax refunds for several weeks this spring.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium bill came up for consideration just as Gov. Bob Holden
announced he would have to slash funding for state universities, cut
payments to nursing homes, defer maintenance on prisons, eliminate
dental insurance for poor adults and furlough 6,000 state workers to
plug budget gaps.</TE>
<TE>   Holden and other stadium backers argued that the budget crisis was
irrelevant because the Cardinals deal would not begin to draw down
state resources until 2005. But that nuance was lost on a furious
public. Polls showed that two-thirds of area residents did not want
their tax dollars building a ballpark. An anti-stadium petition drive
netted nearly 19,000 signatures.</TE>
<TE>   "Our basic message was: Fund the needy, not the greedy," said
activist Eric Vickers.</TE>
<TE>   Potent as such slogans are, analysts say they're not the only
reason that stadium deals have lost their allure.</TE>
<TE>   City after city has found that new ballparks do not always bring a
sustained increase in attendance. Ticket sales sometimes spike for a
year, only to slump again.</TE>
<TE>   In Milwaukee and Pittsburgh, for instance, new baseball stadiums
drew record crowds last year. This season, sales are way off. Similar
patterns have beset teams in Detroit, Cleveland and Baltimore. (The
San Francisco Giants, the only team to finance a stadium without
major public funds, are a rare exception.)</TE>
<TE>   Promises that the stadiums will revitalize sagging cities have
often proved overblown as well. "In downtowns across America,"
Rosentraub said, "people are beginning to realize that ... stadiums
by themselves are too small to generate any [economic activity]
that's worth much."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, people in St. Louis are well aware that losing
the Cardinals would be an enormous economic blow. "Comparable to
demolishing the [Gateway] Arch," said one prominent downtown
businessman.</TE>
<TE>   The team pays about $8 million in city taxes each year, plus $12
million in state taxes. Just as important, it draws people from
across the Midwest to St. Louis, filling downtown hotels and
restaurants as well as Busch Stadium, the 36-year-old ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cardinals bring 3 million people into our city each year,"
Rainford said. "They bring money. They bring excitement. When they're
at home, downtown is vibrant and fun. The place is hopping."</TE>
<TE>   Since the financing deal collapsed, Cardinals owners have said
they are looking at other sites for a park, including suburbs north
of St. Louis and land across the Mississippi River in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis officials are scrambling to draft a proposal to keep the
team where it is by offering limited public financing for a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.), for one, hopes the city will
succeed. "I've been rooting for the Cardinals ever since I was tall
enough to turn on the radio. St. Louis wouldn't be St. Louis without
the Cardinals."</TE>

<LD>The only way to tell those are the Lakers out there is that the
uniforms say so.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise they've lost their identity. They've exchanged so many
personality trademarks with the Sacramento Kings it's like "Freaky
Friday."</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the Lakers hypnotized themselves into the underdog role they
talked about before the series.</LD>
<TE>   They've acted in ways we're not accustomed to, a behavior pattern
that includes losing two of the first three games in the Western
Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   They got in touch with their inner champion long enough to come
back from a 24-point deficit and win Game 4 with an unforgettable
finish. But unless they're counting on a few more Kobe-miss,
Shaq-rebound-miss, Vlade-tap-out-to-Horry-for-three sequences, the
Lakers will have to revert to their old selves for much longer than
12 to 24 minutes a game if they want to collect two more victories.
Right now the best that can be said about them is that they can win
this series, not that they will win this series.</TE>
<TE>   They have forgotten that they're a team that is supposed to start
inside, then operate outside. They have to be reminded to play
defense. They even celebrated Sacramento-style after Horry's shot
went through.</TE>
<TE>   It's not some mad scientist or an electrical storm that created
these new Lakers. It has been the Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the keys about basketball is how do you diminish your
opponents' strengths?" Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "How do you
exonerate your own strengths as a basketball club? So far they've
been able to carry that in the last three games.</TE>
<TE>   "They've had five guys in double figures and they've played a very
solid game and been running a good game. They've kept even our
superstars from having real big games in the course of this series.
We have to find a way to break free and play a little bit of an open
game that we're good at."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers entered this series feeling haughty, as if the Kings
would be so dazzled by their championship rings that they wouldn't
put up a fight. And when the Lakers took Game 1 you could almost see
them warming up the cars for the victory parade.</TE>
<TE>   Then Sacramento took the keys with victories in Games 2 and 3. The
Kings have become the arrogant team. They don't think the Lakers can
stop them--and they very well might be right on that point. After
all, the Lakers held the lead for just 27 seconds during the two
games played over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   When the Kings rolled into Staples Center on Sunday afternoon they
were talking about the extra riot police that might be necessary to
preserve order in L.A. after they won.</TE>
<TE>   And who took the needles out of Jackson's desk and replaced them
with calligraphy pens, which he's using to write tributes to the
Kings instead of tormenting them?</TE>
<TE>   Normally he loves to drop little psychological weights on his
opponents and ramp up the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   He passed on a perfect opportunity Sunday, when he was asked if
such a heartbreaking loss would have a detrimental effect on the
Kings for the rest of the series.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't speculate on that," he said. "Of course, I hope that's
true. But this is a team that showed poise. They hit some big, tough
shots down the stretch. And we just made bigger plays. They're not
going to give this to us."</TE>
<TE>   At least the Lakers let the Kings handle the griping about
referees. The Lakers did a lot of that after Game 2, but Sunday they
assigned the blame to its rightful spot.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been getting down these last three games, it's not because
of officiating," Shaquille O'Neal said of the Lakers' tendency to
fall behind by large deficits. "It's because of us making mental
mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, the Kings were the ones complaining.</TE>
<TE>   They wondered why Kobe Bryant wasn't called for more fouls when he
spent the second half in Mike Bibby's jersey. Or why Rick Fox was
called for a foul when he took a swipe at Vlade Divac and barely even
grazed him to stop the clock with 11.8 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Do the officials favor the two-time champions? That's what Chris
Webber hinted at when he said: "I think we're almost on an even
playing field. And that's what we want, just an even playing field. I
think we're garnering some of that respect, but I don't think we have
it yet."</TE>
<TE>   But if the Lakers are going to get champion calls, they're going
to have to go to the basket to force the issue. That's what they used
to do with regularity. Go to O'Neal posting up inside or let Bryant
penetrate.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said a combination of the King defense and whatever's
wrong with O'Neal took away the first option.</TE>
<TE>   "There never was a time in the game when we felt like we could go
to him inside and expect a score," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   They can't count on easy buckets from Shaq? That's like being
unsure the sun will rise in the East. That cuts out the very essence
of their team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've just been pretty cautious about throwing the ball
into Shaquille because of the offensive fouls and things of that
nature," Bryant said. "We don't want him to pick up early ones, so we
kind of got away from that a little bit. As far as my penetration,
it's still there. We just kind of have to be smarter about that,
because of their defense and the way they're funneling me. A lot of
it comes just off of swinging the basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of swinging, the Lakers are flinging. They have fallen in
love with the three-point shot, taking 31 in Game 3--including 17 in
the fourth quarter--then firing up another 26 Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't that disappointed with how the ball moved, I was
disappointed that everybody who caught the ball wanted to shoot a
three instead of keeping it moving on to someone," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers also have abandoned some of their basic defensive
tenets, including Jackson's disdain for the double-team. The Kings
still seem to get the shots they want more often than not.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, after all the stumbles and bumbles, the Lakers won. They
still have done that nine times in 12 playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been figuring out ways we can win when we're not playing
our best basketball," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   It's becoming the only trait they carry consistently.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Stay Hot Against White Sox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest crowd of the year at Chicago's Comiskey Park saw the New
York Yankees do what they do best--win.</LD>
<LD>   Bernie Williams homered, doubled and drove in four runs, and the
Yankees' offense had another big game, defeating the White Sox, 10-6,
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd of 43,781 was the biggest at new Comiskey for the
Yankees, and many of the fans rooted for the Bronx Bombers.</LD>
<TE>   "It's still very exciting to play in front of large crowds. Our
motivation still goes up," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   New York Manager Joe Torre, whose club has won 16 of 20, said
there are Yankee fans everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We draw a crowd wherever we go. We have guys, like [Derek] Jeter
and [Jason] Giambi, who people want to see," Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Johnson hit a three-run homer, and Rondell White had three
hits and two runs batted in, and New York scored in double digits for
the second consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to hit homers," Williams said. "In my mind,
we're still trying to win with pitching and defense. The home runs
are just a bonus."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Thurman (1-0), pitching in place of injured Orlando Hernandez
and making his first AL start, gave up two runs and seven hits in
seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 8, Toronto 6--Nomar Garciaparra homered and drove in three
runs, and Jason Varitek also had three runs batted in at Toronto, and
the Red Sox sent the Blue Jays to their fourth consecutive defeat and
sixth in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Mondesi drove in a season-high four runs for the Blue Jays,
including a two-run homer in the ninth against Rich Garces that cut
the deficit to 8-6. Ugueth Urbina replaced Garces and earned his 16th
save in 17 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Texas 2--Torii Hunter of the Twins hit his 14th home
run to tie for the AL lead and drove in three runs at Arlington,
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Rafael Palmeiro homered for the Rangers, who lost
their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro hit his 11th homer leading off the sixth, giving him
1,500 runs batted in. He became the 39th player to reach the
milestone.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Cleveland 1--Mark Redman pitched a career-best
four-hitter at Cleveland and defeated the Indians for the second time
in a week.</TE>
<TE>   Redman (2-5) mixed a few slow breaking pitches with his fastball
and improved to 4-1 with a 2.27 earned-run average in five starts
against Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Redman gave up a second-inning home run to Ellis Burks, a two-out
single to Ricky Gutierrez in the fifth and two singles in the ninth.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Eckstein Appears Ready to Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortstop David Eckstein, who missed four consecutive games because
of a sprained left knee before pinch-hitting in the Angels' 5-2 loss
to Minnesota on Sunday, may return to the lineup today when the
Angels open a two-game series with the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Eckstein said his knee felt a lot better before the team departed
for Kansas City, but Angel Manager Mike Scioscia cautioned there is
no reason to rush Eckstein back into the lineup.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to make sure he's playing at a level he needs to play, to
play shortstop, and it may take some time," Scioscia said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not just like you're coming back and you're going to hit and
run. It's a demanding position that you have to really feel good as
far as where your legs are.</TE>
<TE>   "All indications are he's making progress. He can hit. Playing
defense will be the next step."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein failed to drive in Scott Spiezio from third base Sunday
during his plate appearance in the seventh inning, hitting a ground
ball to Minnesota shortstop Cristian Guzman, who threw Spiezio out at
the plate. Eckstein, wearing a protective pad over his injured knee,
was replaced by pinch-runner Adam Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein, who suffered his injury sliding into first base against
Kansas City on May 20, has not enjoyed the view from the dugout while
sitting out more games than at any other time in his five-year
professional career.</TE>
<TE>   He has been the Angels' most pleasant surprise this season,
stealing a team-high 11 bases and hitting .273 with three home runs
and 24 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to watch, but fortunately the team is playing
very well," Eckstein said. "But there's that fine line where you
don't want to return and do something [to cause] further damage."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo Amezaga, called up from triple-A Salt Lake on Friday,
understands why Scioscia lifted him in favor of pinch-hitter Orlando
Palmeiro on Sunday with a runner on third and one out in the seventh
inning. But Amezaga also longs for the opportunity to make an impact
in a high-pressure situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely. That's why I came here," Amezaga said.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein batted for Palmeiro when the Twins replaced reliever Mike
Jackson with J.C. Romero but failed to drive in the run.</TE>
<TE>   "What we were looking for with a guy on third base was guys who
are going to make contact," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With four games left in May, the Angels have a chance for their
best record in the month in club history.</TE>
<TE>   They are 17-5 and could surpass the 1989 team's 18-7 record with
continued success in two games against Kansas City and two more
against Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels swept the Royals in a three-game series last week and
are 16-4 against American League Central teams.</TE>

<LD>John Rocker struck out three batters in two innings Monday to earn
his first victory with triple-A Oklahoma, which defeated Sacramento,
4-2, at Oklahoma City.</LD>
<LD>   It was Rocker's second appearance with Oklahoma since being
demoted by the Texas Rangers last week.</LD>
<LD>   He also had been sent down in April, but didn't report and instead
worked with former Ranger pitching coach Tom House until he was
recalled a week later.</LD>
<TE>   Rocker (1-0) struck out the first two batters of the seventh and
got the third batter to ground out to short.</TE>
<TE>   He struck out the first batter of the eighth before Carlos Pena
got a hit. Rocker got the next two batters to fly out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado Rockies sent outfielder Benny Agbayani and
right-hander Shawn Chacon to triple-A Colorado Springs on
rehabilitation assignments.</TE>
<TE>   Agbayani has been on the disabled list with a strained right
hamstring since May 13.</TE>
<TE>   Chacon went on the disabled list May 9 with a strained chest
muscle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former National League most valuable player Kevin Mitchell had his
suspension in the Western Baseball League increased to seven games
for throwing a punch at an opposing team's third-base coach.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, manager of the Sonoma County Crushers, took a swing at
Larry Olenberger of the Solano Steelheads on Saturday night. He was
automatically banned three games and fined $250 for the infraction.</TE>
<TE>   After more investigation, league President Sam Pepper increased
the punishment to seven games Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell accused Olenberger throughout the game of stealing signs
from the Crusher catcher and relaying them to Steelhead batters.</TE>

<LD>Bill Lyon in the Philadelphia Inquirer: "Once, the two sweetest
swingers in sports were discussing the relative merits of their
professions: Theodore Samuel Williams, the last man to bat .400, and
Samuel Jackson Snead, golfer.</LD>
<LD>   "Williams, it is said, held forth for quite a time with profane
eloquence about the difficulty of hitting a ball that is thrown with
speed and guile. But in golf, he sneered, the ball isn't moving at
all.</LD>
<LD>   "And Snead drawled this terse rebuttal: 'Yeah, but you don't have
to find your foul balls and play 'em.'"</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA playoff record for three-point
field goals in a half?</TE>
<TE>   Just a triple, please: One person who didn't want to see Shawn
Green hit a record-tying home run in Milwaukee Thursday was Dawn
Becker of North Hills. She was rooting for a triple, which would have
given her $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Becker was the contestant of the day in KXTA's Kragen Auto Parts
$1-million Hit for the Cycle promotion, in which a listener can win
$1 million if the player she or he picks hits for the cycle.</TE>
<TE>   When Green came up in the ninth inning, he already had three home
runs, a double and a single.</TE>
<TE>   Slide factor: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle writes
that the NBA can salvage the playoffs if it purges itself of some of
the following sins:</TE>
<TE>   * "The flop. Some players spray their shorts with Teflon, for
longer and more dramatic fanny-glides across the hardwood. Most refs
can't tell when a player is flopping. Most refs think Jim Carrey's
forte is subtle nuance."</TE>
<TE>   * "The walk. Do the world's greatest athletes really need those
four bonus steps?"</TE>
<TE>   Blah, blah: Hubert Mizell in the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times: "It
seems Deion Sanders, as neon as he might have been as an athlete, is
a one-trick bore as a TV commentator, capable of little but yapping
about himself."</TE>
<TE>   More Mizell: "Why did it take NFL bosses so long to recognize it
is as ludicrous for Los Angeles not to have a football franchise as
it would be to list the world's greatest cities without Paris?"</TE>
<TE>   Dark Ages revisited: Art Spander in the Oakland Tribune: "We've
stepped off the high road and down into the gutter. We've returned to
witch hunts, the literal ones of Salem in the 1600s, the figurative
ones of Washington in the 1950s. We're making accusations and jumping
at conclusions. We're acting like fools.</TE>
<TE>   "You've seen the stories by now, the hints a star player is gay;
the insistence by Mike Piazza of the New York Mets that he is
heterosexual, the firing or resignation of a reporter from the New
York Post, Wallace Matthews, because he disagreed with the paper's
intent.</TE>
<TE>   "Absurd."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1941, the Senators lost to the New
York Yankees, 6-5, in the first night game played in Washington's
Griffith Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Vince Carter of Toronto, eight, against
Philadelphia, May 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: "The Colorado Rockies have been storing their
baseballs in a humidor to keep them moist," says Michael Ventre of
MSNBC.com. "In a related development, Gaylord Perry has contacted the
club about making a comeback."</TE>

<LD>USC got the NCAA baseball regional it hoped for by winning the
Pacific 10 Conference. Cal State Northridge is happy not to have to
pull out its luggage, but West Coast teams don't like the thought of
being lumped in the same regionals.</LD>
<LD>   Geography determined the seedings and regional pairings when the
64-team NCAA tournament was announced Monday. Because of an NCAA
mandate handed down after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the
Division I baseball committee was told to keep as many teams as
possible from having to fly.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the 16 four-team regional sites are in the Western time
zone. USC's Dedeaux Field is one of them and the Trojans (34-22) are
seeded No. 1 with Northridge, the Big West champion, No. 2. Maine
(40-15) and Brigham Young (29-29-1) are the other teams coming to Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Northridge Coach Mike Batesole, who is among those being
considered for the Fresno State job, said he didn't think his team
was slighted when it didn't get a No. 1 seeding and was sent to
another regional. Because of an antiquated facility, the Matadors
(40-15) did not put in a bid to be a host.</TE>
<TE>   "We do this three or four years in a row and maybe we'll earn the
respect of being a No. 1 seed," Batesole said.</TE>
<TE>   While Gillespie had no complaints about his regional pairing, he
was among many that questioned the selection committee's choice to
put Big West rivals Long Beach State (37-19) and Cal State Fullerton
(36-20) in a power-packed regional at Stanford. The Cardinal finished
second in the Pac-10, and the other team, San Jose State, has won a
school-record 45 games.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Coach George Horton believed his team was in danger of
not getting in after being swept at Long Beach last weekend to finish
fourth in the Big West. "We didn't handle ourselves at all at the
end," Horton said. "We only had ourselves to blame. But I believe
that we deserved to be in the top 64."</TE>
<TE>   Florida State earned the No. 1 national seeding. The Southeastern
Conference had seven teams selected, followed by the Big 12,
Conference USA and the ACC with five and the Pac-10 with four.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Tales From Augusta"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Jim Hawkins</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Sports Publishing LLC</TE>
<TE>   Price: $19.95</TE>
<TE>   This 200-page, 5x8 1/4-inch hardcover books opens with this quote
from Jack Nicklaus: "The Masters is a monument to everything that is
great in golf. It is a cut above. Way above."</TE>
<TE>   The author opens with: "The first thing that strikes you the first
time you set foot on hallowed, immaculate Augusta National is how
utterly green it is. How absolutely perfect."</TE>
<TE>   It's clear from the start how the author, a Detroit-area sports
journalist who covered his first Masters in 1968, feels about Augusta
National and the tournament it hosts.</TE>
<TE>   The book consists of a series of light vignettes that are
organized somewhat haphazardly. But there are enough good tidbits to
make the book an interesting read.</TE>
<TE>   The first chapter points out some things that make the Masters
unique, such as fans not being called "fans" but rather "patrons."</TE>
<TE>   The book mainly deals with those who have played at Augusta. The
second chapter is on Tiger Woods, the third on Nicklaus. Chapter Six
provides a background of the television coverage, which began in
1956.</TE>
<TE>   One of the 22 chapters is titled "Slammin' Sammy" and features Sam
Snead, who died last week. Snead won the Masters three times.</TE>
<TE>   What is lacking in the book, besides any hint of investigative
reporting, is good artwork. There are no classic photos--actually no
photos at all. The only artwork consists of 22 amateurish sketches.
Most don't even look like the person they're supposed to represent.</TE>
<TE>   What saves this book is the subject matter. It's hard to miss with
a book on the Masters, even if it is mostly just fluff.</TE>

<HD>DIVAC IS BRIDGE TO SACRAMENTO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Vlade Divac unfolds himself from a comfortable courtside chair,
stretching his 7-foot-1 frame. "Five ... four ... three ... two ...
one," he suddenly bellows to anyone within earshot, which seems to be
anyone caught inside the 916 area code. "No more questions? OK, I'm
leaving now."</LD>
<LD>   Except that he's not going anywhere, hanging around the Sacramento
King practice facility on a recent afternoon to talk to anyone with
something to say, a point to make, a joke to crack, an insult to
hurl.</LD>
<LD>   After 13 seasons in the NBA, including the last four with the
Kings, he's the life of the party. It's clear that he intends to
stick around as long as he can. He's simply having too much fun.</LD>
<TE>   "I like baseball," he says, out of the blue, in Serbian-accented
American English.</TE>
<TE>   Laughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be like you guys," he says. "American."</TE>
<TE>   More laughter.</TE>
<TE>   "My kid plays baseball," he says. "I put him in soccer. There's
too much running. He's a kid. He likes baseball."</TE>
<TE>   What position does he play?</TE>
<TE>   "Out. Somewhere. Out."</TE>
<TE>   Laughter.</TE>
<TE>   In the next moment, he has adopted a serious tone.</TE>
<TE>   "Still today, I feel the most for them," he says of the Lakers,
his opponents in what has become an increasingly compelling Western
Conference finals, tied at two games apiece going into Game 5 tonight
at Arco Arena. "They're my favorite team besides the Kings."</TE>
<TE>   Someone mentions Jerry West, the former Laker general manager (now
with the Memphis Grizzlies) who brought Divac to the United States,
to the NBA, to Los Angeles from Belgrade in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody had to bridge the gap between Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the
next great Laker center, who would turn out to be Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Divac was that man.</TE>
<TE>   "He's my favorite person," Divac says of West. "He had a big
impact on my career, on my life. He's the greatest. It was fun with
the Lakers. Just like I have fun now. I was younger. I tried to
explore the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   Oh and one other thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I never smoked," Divac says.</TE>
<TE>   Never?</TE>
<TE>   "Never."</TE>
<TE>   Ever?</TE>
<TE>   "Ever."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Divac certainly is not the best player in the history of the
league. He's not the best player on the current King roster either.
He's not their best scorer, rebounder or passer. He's not their first
player down the court. Or their best defender.</TE>
<TE>   What he is, is the pin that binds the culturally diverse Kings
together, one of three Europeans who have played prominent roles on
the league's best team during the regular season (61-21).</TE>
<TE>   "He's not white, he's not black, he's just Vlade," said power
forward Chris Webber, a Detroit native.</TE>
<TE>   Divac wasn't the first European player to arrive in the NBA with a
foreign-sounding last name and an even more foreign-looking game. But
he has paved the way for a generation of talented young players from
Europe, including his Sacramento teammates Hedo Turkoglu and Peja
Stojakovic.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a huge part of this team," King Coach Rick Adelman said.
"He's a big brother to Hedo and Peja. They all respect him. I've said
it before about him, but there is no better person than Vlade."</TE>
<TE>   Turkoglu, from Turkey, and Stojakovic, a Serb, arrived with jump
shots in tow, but they had little knowledge of life in the NBA or in
the U.S. Divac rolled out the welcome mat and made them feel like
valuable members of a close-knit team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good for me that Vlade was here," said Stojakovic, who
arrived in Sacramento as a 21-year-old in 1998. "I was scared and
lost. When you are a rookie and a European and you are having
problems and there is a guy who has been here for 10 years, he helps
you. No more bringing the doughnuts and coffee for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Divac suffered the slights and barbs of teammates, fans, coaches
and management. He knew the way to ease his new teammates' burden was
to make them comfortable. There would be no rookie hazing as long as
Divac was around.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nobody," said Turkoglu, who also was 21 when he joined the
Kings in 2000. "I only have the desire to be here. I was the
youngest. Vlade was the oldest. The other guys helped me a lot too,
but he was like a brother to me. If you don't have the support, you
cannot succeed."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Webber refers to Turkoglu as "Brother Hedo."</TE>
<TE>   All in the family?</TE>
<TE>   Divac wasn't so lucky when he arrived in Los Angeles, unable to
speak the language, knowing there would be enormous pressure to
replace Abdul-Jabbar as the Laker center. He was the Lakers'
first-round pick in 1989, the man who would be expected to help take
"Showtime" into the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Never happened.</TE>
<TE>   Divac was unlike any other Laker center. He didn't play
exclusively in the post, like Abdul-Jabbar. He had a hook shot, but
it was kind of a funky move--a dip of the shoulder and a 1950s-style
shotput of the basketball. He shot three-pointers and made
behind-the-back passes, for crying out loud.</TE>
<TE>   And there were numerous stories that he enjoyed smoking cigarettes
more than shooting free throws in practice.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, Divac was among those who reshaped the center
position into what it has become today: a more versatile spot for a
more versatile player.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how many more centers we'll see like Shaquille, a
traditional post-up player, because of the way the game is evolving,"
said Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak, who was an assistant to
West when Divac first joined the team. "It started with big guys like
Vlade popping out and shooting jump shots. Big guys are now shooting
threes like [Dallas' Dirk] Nowitzki. We've got to get used to skills
of big guys being different than they used to be."</TE>
<TE>   Divac's tenure with the Lakers did not last. West overhauled the
team in the summer of 1996, dealing Divac to the Charlotte Hornets
for the rights to a high school kid named Kobe Bryant. A week later,
West signed O'Neal as a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Divac spent two unremarkable seasons with the Hornets, signed with
the Kings as a free agent in 1999 and went to work helping to create
a multinational Western Conference powerhouse in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if O'Neal had ever thanked him for agreeing to be traded to
Charlotte, clearing the way for O'Neal to be signed by the Lakers,
Divac shrugged. "I don't think he cares," he said. "I don't think I
care. It's a good story, though."</TE>
<TE>   Of O'Neal, his rival in the post in this series, Divac said: "We
don't hang out together. I know him pretty well on the floor. It's
all about having fun. He's a good man. If you understand that it's
all entertainment, you'll be all right."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Different day, different city.</TE>
<TE>   Divac is holding court Sunday before Game 4 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he would score 23 points, take seven rebounds, miss a
critical free throw in the closing seconds, stop Bryant and O'Neal on
shots in the last seconds before tapping a rebound directly to Robert
Horry, who swished a three-pointer at the buzzer to make the Kings
100-99 losers.</TE>
<TE>   Just now he's entertaining visitors to the King locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," Divac says, nudging a bored-looking reporter, the same
fellow whose replica New York Cosmos jersey with the No. 10 that Pele
wore sparked the soccer-versus-baseball debate a few days earlier.
"Wake up."</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, it's mentioned that David Robinson has recently
announced his retirement from the league after 15 seasons with the
San Antonio Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   "I played against David for 13 years," Divac says. "More,
actually, since he played internationally too. I learned a lot from
him. I really respect him.... I don't enjoy playing against Shaq. But
David? I always enjoy playing against great players. You can learn
from the best."</TE>
<TE>   Some day, some coach in this country might take a lesson from one
of Divac's coaches in Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   "I was taller than most of the kids," Divac says. "When I started
playing basketball, my coach put me at point guard. Europeans do that
sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Divac says it's how he became such a good ballhandler and shooter
from the perimeter, vital parts of his game today for the Kings, who
play a free-flowing style often seen in European leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick lets you be who you are," Divac said of Adelman's coaching
philosophy. "Nellie [Dallas Coach Don Nelson] is the same way. Some
coaches do more [text]book stuff. We play basketball that people
like. There's a lot of action in a split-second. It's why people like
watching the Kings."</TE>
<TE>   After all this time, it's also why Divac keeps playing.</TE>

<HD>Green, Nomo Lead Win</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Another home run from outfielder and seven strong
innings from starter help beat Brewers, 5-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boos rained down on Shawn Green the last time he played at Dodger
Stadium. Something about his one-for-19 performance during a
seven-game home stand.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, after a power-packed, record-setting six-game trip,
Green was greeted by a standing ovation when he came to the plate for
the first time against the Milwaukee Brewers.</LD>
<LD>   Green did not do much in his first three at-bats, but his
seventh-inning home run into the right-field pavilion helped lift the
Dodgers to a 5-3 victory before 32,491 at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   "One week can make a difference, I guess," said Green, who raised
his batting average from .231 to .282 and increased his homer total
from three to 13 in seven days.</TE>
<TE>   Green is not the only Dodger to see his fortunes change.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown, who threw well against the Brewers in Milwaukee last
Tuesday, was put on the 15-day disabled list Monday, a day after
discomfort in his surgically repaired right elbow caused him to leave
in the first inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Brown, who was
also on the disabled list in April, will undergo an MRI test today.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he was frustrated by having a setback less than a month
after his first stint on the disabled list, Brown said, "I'm sure
that's one word you could use."</TE>
<TE>   Great was the adjective Dodger Manager Jim Tracy used to describe
Hideo Nomo's performance against the Brewers on Monday, though it was
a more accurate reflection of the result rather than the execution.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo (5-5), who pitched six scoreless innings in a 1-0 victory
over the Brewers last Wednesday, gave up two runs and seven hits in
seven innings. He struck out eight, but walked seven, including at
least one in every inning except the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo's ability to pitch out of jams, however, allowed Tracy to
refrain from making an early call to a bullpen that was taxed during
the Dodgers' 10-9, 10-inning loss on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been around long enough to know the circumstances our
bullpen was under," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo gave up a run-scoring single to Jeffrey Hammonds in the fifth
inning and allowed a run in the seventh when Alex Sanchez scored from
third base on a double-play ground ball hit by Hammonds.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to contribute the most that I could by pitching
long innings today," Nomo said through an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers supplied Nomo with a cushion by scoring three runs in
the fourth inning against Brewer starter Ben Sheets (3-5), who
pitched well in the loss to Nomo last week.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Karros led off with a double and moved to third on Brian
Jordan's deep fly ball to center field. After Sheets intentionally
walked Adrian Beltre to set up a double play, Alex Cora hit a one-hop
ground ball that handcuffed third baseman Tyler Houston for a
run-scoring single.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo advanced the runners with a sacrifice and Beltre and Cora
scored on a double to left by Cesar Izturis.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers led, 3-2, when Green stepped in for his fourth at-bat
with one out in the seventh. Green had struck out, hit a fly ball to
center and grounded to second against Sheets.</TE>
<TE>   But standing on the mound was reliever Jose Cabrera, the same
pitcher who gave up three consecutive home runs to the Dodgers in the
ninth Thursday. One of those homers was hit by Green, the exclamation
point on his record-setting four-homer, six-hit, 19-total-base
performance in a 16-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Green didn't wait to see what strategy Cabrera might employ
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He hit the first pitch he saw from him for his 13th homer.</TE>
<TE>   "I was overanxious my first three at-bats," Green said. "I wanted
to try and get a pitch down because I was swinging at a lot of
pitches up. I got one down and was able to get it out."</TE>
<TE>   After Paul Quantrill pitched a scoreless eighth for the Dodgers,
the Brewers pulled to within two runs when Eric Young led off the
ninth with a single against Eric Gagne, moved to third on a double by
Richie Sexson and scored on a Geoff Jenkins' ground ball to short.
Gagne then struck out Houston to earn his league-leading 17th save.</TE>

<HD>Brown's Out, Daal's Starting</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Brown, who left Sunday's game against the Arizona Diamondbacks
in the first inning because of discomfort in his surgically repaired
right elbow, was put on the 15-day disabled list Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Left-hander Omar Daal, who filled in well when Brown went on the
disabled list earlier this season, will take Brown's spot in the
rotation for at least the next two turns. The Dodgers purchased the
contract of reliever Bryan Corey from triple-A Las Vegas and the
right-hander arrived at Dodger Stadium during Monday's 5-3 victory
over the Milwaukee Brewers.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who underwent surgery for a torn flexor tendon last Sept.
27, experienced a grabbing sensation in his elbow after throwing only
20 pitches to six batters against the Diamondbacks at Phoenix. He was
examined by Dr. Frank Jobe before Monday's game and will have an MRI
today.</LD>
<TE>   Brown, who gave up three runs and seven hits in 61/3 innings
against the Brewers last Tuesday, said he was feeling fine the day
before his start on Sunday against the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just it," Brown said, "From feeling so good one day to
feeling so bad the next. We're just trying to figure out exactly
what's wrong and then trying to put the pieces together and maybe
figure out what happened."</TE>
<TE>   This is Brown's sixth trip to the disabled list since signing a
$105-million free-agent contract with the Dodgers on Dec 12, 1998. He
was on the disabled list this season after tearing scar tissue in his
right elbow on April 13 while pitching against the San Diego Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy said Monday's moves were precipitated by the
uncertainty of Brown's condition and the fact that the Dodgers used
five relievers who combined to throw 194 pitches in the 10-9 loss to
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't wait around for a number of days to find out [the extent
of the injury] and subject the club and this bullpen when it was
basically maxed out yesterday," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts went three for three with two walks
and two stolen bases on Monday. He has five hits and two walks in his
last seven plate appearances and is batting .328.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Jesse Orosco, on the disabled list because of a strained
left ribcage muscle, threw off the mound again Monday and said he
feels ready to be activated when he becomes eligible on Wednesday....
Terry Mulholland, on the disabled list because of a strained lower
back, said he felt no pain during an extended bullpen session and
will throw batting practice today with hopes of becoming activated
next week.... Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek did not play Monday
because of a swollen big toe. Grudzielanek was hit on the foot by a
foul ball while batting Sunday.</TE>

<KH>Chris Dufresne SECOND THOUGHTS</KH>
<HD>Canseco Simply Doesn't Have the Write Stuff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warning: This column is being written under a yellow caution flag:</LD>
<LD>   News item: "Ball Four" author Jim Bouton advises Jose Canseco not
to write a tell-all book about baseball.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: "It sounds like he's writing the book I was
accused of writing," Bouton told Bloomberg News.</LD>
<TE>   Memo to J.C.: We knew "Ball Four," "Ball Four," was a friend of
ours. Mr. Canseco, you are not "Ball Four."</TE>
<TE>   Bouton's recount of his 1969 travails with the expansion Seattle
Pilots and Houston Astros remains, in my book, the best sports book
ever written. Just to be sure, I reread "Ball Four" over the weekend
to see how it stood up over time.</TE>
<TE>   Verdict: The memoir has held up better than Don King's hair; you
forgot it is as hilarious as it is revealing.</TE>
<TE>   The book was scandalous only because no player before had dared to
breach the cocoon of the clubhouse, yet Bouton is neither bitter nor
vindictive.</TE>
<TE>   It's an important distinction. Jose, can you see?</TE>
<TE>   The book demythologized players but did not dehumanize them.
Bouton revealed they spied on good-looking women from hotel rooftops,
yes, that Mickey Mantle hit home runs with hangovers and that a lot
of players took pep pills known as "greenies."</TE>
<TE>   Shocking.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Bouton rarely named names and you reckon he could have blown
the roof of the Astrodome had he really wanted to unload.</TE>
<TE>   Management hated "Ball Four" because Bouton exposed owners as
money-grubbing weasels, revelations that would hasten free agency.</TE>
<TE>   Bowie Kuhn, then baseball's commissioner, summoned Bouton to his
office after the book's release and demanded the author sign a
statement saying the book was a pack of lies. Bouton laughed in his
face.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Padres burned "Ball Four" and dumped the ashes in
the visitors' clubhouse. Ah, the price you pay.</TE>
<TE>   Bouton's book is a riot, like the time he asked teammate George
Brunet why he didn't wear underwear: "Hell," Brunet said, "the only
time you need them is if you get into a car wreck. Besides, this way
I don't have to worry about losing them."</TE>
<TE>   Bouton also is brutally honest: Imagine the courage it took to
write about one of the game's best players, "Carl Yastrzemski was
recently fined $500 for loafing and I've been keeping an eye on him.
Sure enough, he hit a ball to second base today and loafed all the
way to first. I'm afraid Yastrzemski has a bit of dog in him. Always
did, and people around baseball knew it all the time."</TE>
<TE>   "Ball Four" remains the book every 17-year-old boy should pick up
right after he puts down "The Catcher in the Rye."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, I can't imagine Canseco, as protagonist, joining the
literary company of Jim Bouton and Holden Caulfield.</TE>
<TE>   Good luck, though.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Seattle Seahawks sign quarterback Ryan Leaf.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Guess which one of the following post-signing
quotes was attributed to Leaf:</TE>
<TE>   A: "The world owes me a living and this just proves it."</TE>
<TE>   B: "The Seahawks just signed one of the top quarterbacks in the
league, I really mean that."</TE>
<TE>   C: "This town smells like fish, or maybe it's just the
sportswriters in this room."</TE>
<TE>   D: "I'll bust my butt, whatever they want me to do here, I will
do."</TE>
<TE>   Believe it or not, the answer is "D".</TE>
<TE>   News item: U.S. Olympic Committee president resigns over resume
discrepancy.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: We know what you're thinking over there at
"Celebrity Boxing," but it may be a tad too early to pit Sandy
Baldwin versus George O'Leary.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Mike Piazza says he is not gay.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: The story here isn't whether Piazza is gay,
straight, green or an atheist. The story, still hard to fathom, is
why Piazza is catching for the New York Mets and not the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Texas Ranger owner Tom Hicks says his big-time spending
days are over.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: "I'm not doing it anymore," Hicks told the Dallas
media. "We are going to play within our means from now on, at least
break even."</TE>
<TE>   We feel for the man paying shortstop Alex Rodriguez $252 million
over 10 years and offer these cost-costing measures: low-watt light
bulbs for the scoreboard; shorten the distance between bases from 90
to 85 feet; eliminate third base and have Rodriguez play both
positions; rolling blackouts in the second, fourth and sixth innings.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Quarterback Cade McNown is on the bubble in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: This could be a double whammy for the former UCLA
star, in jeopardy of losing his job and his parking privileges.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Matt LoVecchio announces he is transferring from Notre
Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: It's tough to blame a guy for wanting to play for
a winning team with a reasonable chance of winning the national
title.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Arizona Cardinal safety Pat Tillman gives up
million-dollar NFL career to join the Army.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Flashback to 1996. I'm in Tempe for an interview
with Arizona State quarterback Jake Plummer. Before leaving, the
sports information director says, "There's a guy you have to meet,
Pat Tillman. He's different."</TE>
<TE>   Tillman had long blond hair. He spoke like a computer analyst. He
would graduate summa cum laude with a 3.84 grade-point average, in
three and a half years.</TE>
<TE>   He recently turned down a $9-million deal with the Rams out of
loyalty to Arizona, and he's giving it all up to be an Army Ranger.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I'd call that different.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Dodgers' Shawn Green hits seven home runs in three
games.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: This incredible outburst brings back misty-colored
memories of 1976, when the Angels' Bobby Bonds walloped 10 homers
over the span ... of a season! Bonds' double-digit explosion total
led the team. Bonds' also led the Angels in runs batted in with 54.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the game has changed or anything.</TE>

<HD>Nets Don't Let It Slip Away</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Two days after record collapse, New Jersey
makes plays to defeat Boston, 94-92.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Jason Kidd grabbed his jersey, raised his head and bellowed, a loud,
long, piercing, cleansing scream. The scream was a way of releasing
tension, anger, frustration and, most of all, joy.</LD>
<LD>   Kidd pointed to the silent crowd at the FleetCenter and yelled,
"You choked, you choked." It was not the dignified thing to do, but
this same crowd had chanted personal insults at Kidd. And for the
previous 48 hours all Kidd heard was how his New Jersey Nets were so
over, so finished after blowing a 26-point third-quarter lead here
Saturday in a loss to the Celtics.</LD>
<LD>   So forgive Kidd his noisy exuberance.</LD>
<TE>   After making embarrassing history Saturday, New Jersey earned a
most improbable victory Monday, 94-92 over the Celtics in Game 4 of
the Eastern Conference finals. The best-of-seven series, tied 2-2,
will resume Wednesday at Continental Airlines Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to win with grace and dignity," said Kidd, who finished
with 19 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, "but sometimes you're
tired of coming into a building and having to tip your hat,
especially when you're supposed to be on Route 93, going home because
we are not even supposed to be in this series, this series is over.
So I was tired of being humbled."</TE>
<TE>   Lucious Harris, a backup who had left Long Beach State as its
all-time leading scorer in 1993, made two free throws with 6.6
seconds left to break a 92-92 tie.</TE>
<TE>   And Harris did what Boston All-Star Paul Pierce could not do. Like
Harris, Pierce took the basketball and drove. Like Harris, Pierce got
fouled, taking a glancing elbow from Keith Van Horn with 1.1 seconds
left. But unlike Harris, Pierce missed his first free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Harris took his shots with all the noise and epithets and insults
and airless gravity that Celtic fans could give him. Pierce shot in
churchlike silence.</TE>
<TE>   After Pierce missed his first free throw, he was forced to miss
the second. The rebound was batted to Celtic center Tony Battie, who
had enough time to rise, cock his wrist and get a good look at the
basket.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought," Harris said, "we were going to overtime."</TE>
<TE>   But Battie's shot bounced off the rim and the Nets bounced off
each other, their spirits rehabilitated and their minds freed of
Saturday's debacle.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey's stars were the quiet duo of guard Kerry Kittles and
forward Keith Van Horn. Kittles, who had missed 17 consecutive
three-point shots, made four, including the game's first basket.</TE>
<TE>   "I was long overdue for a three-pointer. I wanted my first shot to
be a three-pointer to prove to myself I could make a three-point
shot," said Kittles, who had a team-high 22 points. "I wanted to go
out and be aggressive. I wasn't going to pass up any opportunity
today."</TE>
<TE>   Van Horn had 21 points and 10 rebounds. And Kidd, besides his
steady scoring, rebounding and assist totals, also took three crucial
charges in the fourth quarter. Twice Pierce, head down and mind made
up, ran smack into Kidd under the Celtic basket. Rodney Rogers did it
the other time.</TE>
<TE>   And yet with all that, the Nets almost let the Celtics cut their
hearts out again. After trailing, 61-46, early in the third quarter
and 67-53 with 5:29 left in the period, Boston casually galloped
through a 13-2 run to make it 69-66 with 52.3 seconds left. Since the
Nets had led the Celtics by 21 at the end of the third quarter
Saturday, Boston seemed in perfect shape.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey staggered back to lead, 78-70, with 10:07 left. Barely
two minutes later, the score was 80-78. Twice more the Nets would
lead by six, the final time at 86-80, but Rogers was left alone to
make a three-pointer with 3:32 left. No one guarded him because most
of the Nets focused on Pierce and Antoine Walker. At one point, those
two had scored 31 of Boston's 34 points. Pierce finished with 31 and
Walker with 30, and New Jersey was almost beaten by Rogers and Kenny
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   After his three-pointer, Rogers made a free throw. Anderson made
two driving layups in the last two minutes, including one to cut New
Jersey's lead to 92-90. Pierce made two free throws with 17.6 seconds
left to tie the score and set up the last, furious, seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "They talk about all the ghosts in this building," Harris said.
"Hey, is the ghost still here?"</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the ghosts had been buried with the old Boston Garden.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets scared up a new one Saturday. They buried it Monday.</TE>

<HD>Blatter Faces Contentious Election</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Even if FIFA chief is retained, as expected, legal
troubles could cloud his future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>After more than six months of mudslinging in the finest of political
traditions, representatives of FIFA's 204 member nations will gather
here Wednesday to elect a leader.</LD>
<LD>   The choice before them is simple: They can retain the incumbent,
Joseph "Sepp" Blatter of Switzerland, as president of international
soccer's governing body, or they can replace him with challenger Issa
Hayatou of Cameroon.</LD>
<LD>   By Monday, it appeared that Blatter would win comfortably--or
perhaps uncomfortably would be more to the point.</LD>
<TE>   That's because Blatter knows that even if he gets a majority of
the votes, he still faces potentially serious legal action in
Switzerland, where accusations of corruption and misuse of funds
could, if proven, lead to him being ousted from office during his
second four-year term.</TE>
<TE>   The parallels to Watergate were too much for the European press to
resist, and Blattergate entered the lexicon. Even Lennart Johansson
of Sweden, the 72-year-old president of UEFA, European soccer's
ruling body, was not immune.</TE>
<TE>   "There are similarities," he said May 17, "because after
Watergate, [former President] Nixon was still voted in as president
before people knew all the facts. But the allegations never went away
and he eventually had to go."</TE>
<TE>   Johansson was defeated, 111-80, by Blatter in the 1998 FIFA
presidential election in Paris, an election that published reports
claim was tainted by bribery on the part of Blatter supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter, meanwhile, remains unperturbed.</TE>
<TE>   "Let us play football now and then let's see what will happen with
the case which has been brought to a court in Zurich," he said
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter, despite being prone to banal remarks that reflect his
background in public relations, has a shrewdness and political savvy
acquired during 17 years of service as FIFA secretary general under
former president Joao Havelange of Brazil. His critics have found it
all but impossible to pin him down.</TE>
<TE>   The latest to try has been Michel Zen-Ruffinen, who replaced
Blatter as secretary general and who on May 3 delivered an explosive
21-page report (backed by 300 pages of documentation) to FIFA's
Executive Committee alleging that Blatter could have violated Swiss
law in his handling of FIFA finances.</TE>
<TE>   Stunned by the revelations, 11 members of the 24-member Executive
Committee, including Johansson and Hayatou, asked Blatter to resign.
He refused. As a result, the 11 initiated legal action by filing
papers with Swiss prosecutors in Zurich.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the squabble are FIFA's finances, which have been
in alleged disarray since the bankruptcy of FIFA's marketing partner,
ISL-ISMM, in May 2001 with debts of anywhere between $300 million and
$1.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   They were exacerbated this April by the collapse of KirchMedia,
the German company that held the television rights to the 2002 and
2006 World Cup tournaments, the "cash cow" events that essentially
bankroll FIFA operations.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter, 66, has long insisted that the finances are in order and
that safeguards are in place to protect FIFA. But, with a majority of
supporters on the FIFA Finance Committee, he has been able to resist
attempts to open the books for examination. He has even consistently
refused to reveal his own salary.</TE>
<TE>   That has fueled increasing suspicion that all is not well.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Johansson demanded an internal audit of FIFA's
finances, but nothing happened. In December, 11 or the 24 members of
the Executive Committee demanded the same thing, but Blatter said
that 11 was not a majority and ignored the demand.</TE>
<TE>   After newspaper reports in Europe cast serious doubts about the
financial health of world soccer's ruling body and revisited the
whole 1998 bribery issue, the Executive Committee in March overrode
Blatter and established an Internal Audit Committee (IAC).</TE>
<TE>   One month later, Blatter suspended the IAC from proceeding,
claiming breaches of confidentiality. That led to the May 3 emergency
meeting of the Executive Committee at which Zen-Ruffinen delivered
his bombshell about "financial irregularities" within FIFA.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter denied any such irregularities, calling them "bizarre and
unfounded" and immediately cut Zen-Ruffinen off from receiving any
further financial information. He ordered Urs Linzi, FIFA's financial
director, to report instead to Julio Grondona of Argentina, a FIFA
vice president and key Blatter ally.</TE>
<TE>   "The secretary general would do better to work more than play CIA
and FBI," Blatter told the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the imbroglio, it has been a case of mudslinging on one
side and stonewalling on the other, with the truth falling somewhere
in between. Curiously, Hayatou, president of the Confederation of
African Football (CAF), has remained largely above the fray.</TE>
<TE>   His strongest public statement came in response to Blatter's claim
that his critics were merely out to smear him in an election year.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if it were not a period of campaigning for the elections, it
would still be my duty to ... voice my condemnation against the
reprehensible acts of the head of FIFA," Hayatou, 55, said in Tokyo
on May 13.</TE>
<TE>   Instead it has been Johansson and another FIFA vice president,
Chung Mong-Joon of South Korea, who have launched the heaviest
salvoes at Blatter.</TE>
<TE>   Citing Swiss media reports that FIFA has incurred $500 million in
losses during Blatter's tenure, Chung this month said: "FIFA is in
serious financial and political crisis. It is divided and faces a
crisis in leadership."</TE>
<TE>   But as the allegations have been spat back and forth, FIFA's
membership as a whole has remained largely unmoved, a fact Johansson
commented upon bitterly.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority are happy as long as they are getting the
[financial] contributions [from FIFA]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Unless there is an upset of monumental proportions, Wednesday's
election is likely to see Blatter returned to office and his allies
put in control of all the significant committees.</TE>
<TE>   If so, the charges that have been made probably will disappear.
The FIFA carpet is large enough for many things to be swept
underneath.</TE>
<TE>   There remains, however, the troubling matter of that lawsuit in
Switzerland, and it is likely to be in the courts where this story
has its true ending.</TE>

<HD>A Surface-to-Err Miss for Sampras</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Clay court brings out his worst, as usual, in
first-round loss to Italy's Gaudenzi at French Open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The doubts started in this place, on this slowest of surfaces, and
gradually wormed their way into Pete Sampras' psyche, creating a
crisis of confidence on all surfaces. For almost two years, the man
considered by some to be the best tennis player ever has not won a
title.</LD>
<LD>   He tried the right things. Making a concession to age, he started
training harder at 30. To get wiser, Sampras hired the preeminent
mind in the game, clay-court guru Jose Higueras. Those things,
however, have not helped him flip the switch at crucial junctures the
way he once did--for instance, on break points or in tiebreakers.</LD>
<LD>   Clay and the French Open only illuminate Sampras' problems,
turning concern into anxiety.</LD>
<TE>   Sampras used just that word, anxiety, to describe his Paris
experience Monday after another devastating loss. This time, it was
oft-injured Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy who dispatched the 12th-seeded
Sampras, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, 7-6 (3), in the first round at the French
Open. Sampras lost the final five points.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-hour 5-minute match was twice delayed by rain--the first
interruption lasting an hour and 45 minutes--and finished as darkness
fell, when Sampras hit a backhand volley just long at 9 p.m. (Paris
time).</TE>
<TE>   Gaudenzi patted Sampras on the shoulder after they shook hands at
the net. About 1,500 spectators, the remainder of the rain-splattered
crowd at Court Philippe Chatrier, chanted "Sam-pras, Sam-pras" as he
walked off, perhaps wondering if this would be his last appearance
here.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say it's a jinx," said Sampras, who has never won
the French Open, the only Grand Slam title to elude him. "It's not
like I lost four finals here. It's a question of playing well on
clay. But, you know, if Paris never happens over my career, life will
go on. But I will come back and try again."</TE>
<TE>   Gaudenzi had lost to Sampras in three previous matches, twice on
clay. He received a significant assist Monday from Sampras, who made
93 unforced errors and converted only three of 17 break-point
opportunities. In the seventh game of the third set, after missing
another break-point chance, Sampras had a rare display of anger,
throwing his racket after a forehand went wide.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in the fourth set, minutes before the second rain delay,
Sampras knocked a ball high into the stands after another squandered
break-point opportunity and received a code violation warning for
ball abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "What can I say? He's probably the best tennis player who ever
breathed," said Gaudenzi, who is ranked 69th, "[but] you cannot
always be at the top and pretending you can win on all surfaces.
Definitely his game is not made for clay. It's so much more difficult
for him to play good on this surface.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite an honor to play him at the end sometimes. And to beat
him is a great thing. I know I'm aware I didn't beat him at his best,
his best surface, so it doesn't mean a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras was two points away from sending the match into a fifth
set, serving for the fourth at 5-4, 30-15. Three points later, he was
broken when he missed an easy overhead, smashing it into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "When I played the high lob, my mind was a little bit already in
the fifth set," Gaudenzi said.</TE>
<TE>   Quite simply, the big points never have fallen Sampras' way in
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "This match, having so many chances, yeah, I had anxiety," Sampras
said. "I've had that over the course of my years here. That's kind of
the word that defines what's happened here."</TE>
<TE>   Another member of Sampras' generation, 30-year-old Michael Chang,
who did win the title here once, famously, in 1989, is going through
the same sort of confidence crisis, though on a deeper scale. French
wild-card entrant Sebastien De Chaunac, who is ranked 173rd, defeated
Chang, 4-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4, in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to overcome the idea I was playing Chang," said De
Chaunac, 25. "Now, he's a great player. I have a lot of respect for
him. But I don't think it's the same Michael Chang that I would have
met some 10 years ago. His results are worse."</TE>
<TE>   Chang, who has pulled himself together after other tough defeats,
sounded like his usual self, saying: "If I got to the point where I
don't have the desire to work hard, then I'll call it a day."</TE>
<TE>   And so, Chang and Sampras were gone on the first day of a Grand
Slam event, and qualifier Jack Brasington moved on to the second
round. How often have you heard that? Brasington defeated Federico
Luzzi of Italy, 6-2, 6-2, 7-5, and will play Gaudenzi next. Joining
him in the second round was Todd Martin, the marathon man, who beat
Argentine qualifier Martin Vasallo Arguello, 6-2, 7-5, 3-6, 4-6, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Jan-Michael Gambill was not so lucky in his five-setter. Younes El
Aynaoui of Morocco, seeded 16th, beat Gambill, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 3-6,
6-4, and flexed his arm afterward. Gambill, who has won one match in
five trips here, responded with his own gesture, tossing his racket.</TE>
<TE>   There was one minor upset on the women's side: Paola Suarez of
Argentina beat eighth-seeded Sandrine Testud of France, 2-6, 7-5,
6-1, in the first round. Largely untroubled in the first round were
No. 2 Venus Williams, who defeated Bianka Lamade of Germany, 6-3,
6-3, and No. 10 Amelie Mauresmo of France, who beat wild-card entrant
Camille Pin of France, 6-4, 6-1.</TE>

<HD>Astra Surprises Starine, Desormeaux in Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starine ran more than well enough to win the $474,000 Gamely
Breeders' Cup Handicap on Monday at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for her, the field for the Grade I also included
Astra, the top female turf performer in the country, who demonstrated
why she deserves that label.</LD>
<LD>   Seemingly beaten with less than an eighth of a mile to go, Astra,
the defending champion, showed the quick turn of foot she has
demonstrated on numerous other occasions and got up to beat Starine,
the 9-5 second choice, by a head.</LD>
<TE>   An 8-5 favorite, the 6-year-old Theatrical mare won for the 10th
time in 14 starts and completed the 1 1/8 miles in 1:46 4/5 under
jockey Kent Desormeaux.</TE>
<TE>   Her latest victory for Laura De Seroux, who trains her for the
family of the late Allen Paulson, pushed her career earnings over $1
million. She has now banked $1,088,424.</TE>
<TE>   "From the head of the lane until the eighth pole, I thought I was
going to be second," said Desormeaux. "I had conceded [to Starine].
But Astra just kept building momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "I could feel the hair rise on the back of my neck. I might be a
little bit prejudiced because I ride her, but there is not another
horse with the turn of foot she has. She is the best of them."</TE>
<TE>   Starine, who had drawn away to a 1 1/2-length lead with a furlong
to run after getting a perfect ride from jockey Alex Solis, finished
a length in front of 3-1 third choice Voodoo Dancer. Then came Crazy
Ensign, Snow Dance and Old Money.</TE>
<TE>   De Seroux indicated Astra, who has won five of six starts at 1 1/8
miles, will try to defend her title in the $250,000 Beverly Hills
Handicap on June 29, then try the Beverly D. at Arlington Park later
in the summer before the Breeders' Cup Filly or Mare Turf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second to stablemate Silic in the Shoemaker Breeders' Cup Mile in
1999 and 2000, Ladies Din broke through with a win in the grassy
Grade I on Monday at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Giving trainer Julio Canani his third victory in the race in four
years, the 7-year-old Din's Dancer gelding and 2-1 favorite took
charge in the final eighth of a mile to win by three lengths in 1:33
1/5.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Terry Lanni and Bernie Schiappa, Ladies Din was ridden by
Patrick Valenzuela as he won for the 12th time in 35 starts. The
$240,000 payday pushed his earnings to $1,955,504.</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies Din was in the right place, moved at the right time and
the race was history," said Canani. "I don't want to be cocky, but
believe me, Ladies Din is a special horse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to try to win the Breeders' Cup [Mile] this year. I
don't know what I'm going to do, but that is the goal for this
horse."</TE>
<TE>   Redattore, the 4-1 third choice, finished a length in front of
Spinelessjellyfish, the longest shot in the field at 71-1, then came
Orientate, Thady Quill, Special Ring (the other Canani entrant),
Casey Griffin, Touch Of The Blues, The Tin Man and Irish Prize, the
defending champion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beaten in his first two races of the year in California, Swept
Overboard woke up in a big way Monday in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Overlooked in the $750,000 Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park,
the 5-year-old gray rolled to a 4 3/4-length victory over Aldebaran
and eight others in 1:33 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden for the first time by Jorge Chavez, Swept Overboard paid
$24.60 for his eighth win in 18 starts and the $450,000 he earned for
owner J. Paul Redddam and trainer Craig Dollase put him over $1.1
million for his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start since finishing third in the Jim Dandy
Stakes last Aug. 4, Congaree, the 4-5 favorite, led all the way under
jockey Pat Day to win the $300,000 Lone Star Park Handicap in Grand
Prairie, Texas.</TE>

<HD>Castroneves Victory Stands at Indy 500</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: IRL officials say evidence is insufficient to
back up Tracy protest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The winner, and still champion--Helio Castroneves!</LD>
<LD>   The Indy Racing League ruled Monday at Indianapolis that there was
not enough evidence to support a protest by runner-up Paul Tracy and
Team Green and that Castroneves' victory in Sunday's Indianapolis 500
would stand.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy passed Castroneves on Lap 199 of the 200-lap race, just as
cars driven by Laurent Redon and Buddy Lazier tangled half a lap
behind. At issue was when the yellow caution light was displayed,
before Tracy made his pass or afterward. Positions are frozen when
the light comes on. Tracy maintained that he had passed Castroneves
while the green light was showing. Castroneves said the light was
yellow.</LD>
<TE>   "This was such an incredible set of circumstances," said Brian
Barnhart, the IRL vice president for operations and the race's chief
steward.</TE>
<TE>   After a two-hour hearing with Team Green, and two more hours of
deliberation, IRL officials concluded that there was insufficient
proof that Tracy had moved ahead before the caution period was
called. Officials had reviewed tapes and other pertinent data for
nearly six hours after Sunday's race before declaring Castroneves,
the defending race champion, the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "Team Green did not present anything that was conclusive enough in
any way, shape or form to change our mind," Barnhart said after
Monday's session.</TE>
<TE>   Team Green has five business days to file an appeal, which would
leave the decision in the hands of Tony George, IRL president and
owner of the Indianapolis Speedway. Tom McGovern of Team Green said
no decision had been made on an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, the team is just looking at our options," he said.
"We're going to step back, accept second place [for now] and go from
there."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said, "I'm very disappointed, obviously."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling confirmed Castroneves as the first repeat winner since
Al Unser in 1971 and Roger Penske as the winning owner for the 12th
time.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the process was a good one," Penske said of the review
and hearing. "It's unfortunate we have this kind of an end. Let's get
on to the next race."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, in response to a question, Tracy had said that, since
he normally drives in races sanctioned by CART, the IRL's rival group
in open-wheel racing, he thought politics might play a part in the
decision. Barnhart said Monday that had not been the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who would look at how quick this decision had to be made
would know the thought of IRL versus CART can't remotely cross my
mind," Barnhart said. "You really try so hard to make the right call
in your heart, in your gut, and know exactly what is being done."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the final decision had been made based on three
points on Lap 199 at which Castroneves was indisputably the leader:</TE>
<TE>   * At the last line of scoring before the caution period.</TE>
<TE>   * At the time of the accident.</TE>
<TE>   * At the time race officials called for a caution.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the yellow lights mounted along the track perimeter, there
also are car installations, on the steering wheels or dashboards.
Barnhart said there was no question that Castroneves was leading when
the yellow lights went on in the cars, but said there was no way to
tell who was leading when the track lights came on, since there can
be a split-second's difference.</TE>
<TE>   "There are always human-reaction times," he said. "But I think the
system did work well."</TE>
<TE>   For Penske, the situation was at least slightly reminiscent of the
1981 race.</TE>
<TE>   That year, Bobby Unser, driving for Penske, took the checkered
flag as the apparent winner. When the official standings were posted
the next morning, however, Unser had been penalized a lap for passing
during a caution period and Mario Andretti was listed as the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Penske appealed and hearings went beyond the summer before the
then-sanctioning United States Auto Club revoked the penalty in

infraction, not a day later.</TE>

<HD>Walker Shot Has Adelman Up in Arms</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The headline in the Sacramento Bee sports section read: "How
Horry-ble." But other than continuing to call Robert Horry's
three-pointer lucky, the Kings had no problems with the shot that
beat them at the buzzer in Game 4.</LD>
<LD>   King Coach Rick Adelman was troubled by another buzzer-beater,
however. Adelman, after finally seeing what NBC's viewers did, was
upset Monday that Samaki Walker's three-pointer before halftime
counted. Replays clearly showed the ball in Walker's hands as time
expired.</LD>
<LD>   "NBC had it frame-by-frame," Adelman said. "How hard is it to take
five seconds to look at [the replay] and make the right call? Every
other sport has it [video replay]. It's going to happen in the
off-season, but it doesn't help us now.... I never saw it until I got
home. I slowed it down and you could see all zeros behind him as he
shot the ball. What are you going to do?"</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peja Stojakovic worked out harder than he has since spraining his
right ankle May 9, but Adelman termed his status "doubtful" for Game
5 tonight at Arco Arena. Stojakovic is expected to work out again
this morning and a final decision about his participation will be
made at game time.</TE>
<TE>   "Peja has not really practiced with us," Adelman said. "He's not
gone one-on-one. I think Peja wants to play so badly right now. He's
progressed a lot. He worked harder today than he has. [The Kings'
medical staff] wants to see what soreness he has [today]. That's the
thing. He's had a lot of soreness after his workouts."</TE>
<TE>   If Stojakovic can't play, Adelman will again start Hedo Turkoglu
at small forward. Turkoglu had his best game of the conference finals
Sunday, scoring 18 points and taking 12 rebounds in 43 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No question, the Lakers got physical with King point guard Mike
Bibby in the last three quarters Sunday. Kobe Bryant's pressure
limited Bibby to seven points after he had scored 14 in the first 17
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But were they too physical?</TE>
<TE>   "I petitioned the league to outlaw the bump-and-run," Adelman
joked. "Phil [Jackson, Laker coach] complained about us manhandling
his 350-pound center [Shaquille O'Neal]. Well, they're manhandling
our 150-pound point guard. I don't see why the rules change. If
they're not going to call [the rough stuff], we have to find a way to
help Mike out."</TE>
<TE>   With that said, Adelman said Bibby did too much dribbling in an
attempt to beat Bryant down the floor. Adelman wants the Kings to
pass the ball down the court and/or have others bring the ball up.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got to let the other guys take the ball up a little bit
more," Adelman said. "I think we can adjust to that. We knew
eventually they would put Kobe on Mike. It was only a matter of
time."</TE>
<TE>   Said forward Chris Webber: "They caught us off guard with Kobe on
Bibby. We know he's a scorer. He's going to get tired. We're not
intimidated. He's going to get picked-and-rolled to death."</TE>

<HD>Trade Not Made Was Best for Him</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There are two large frames in the game room of Robert Horry's home in
Houston.</LD>
<LD>   One displays the front of a red and blue Detroit Piston uniform.</LD>
<LD>   The other shows the back of a second Piston jersey, with "HORRY"
across the shoulders.</LD>
<TE>   Horry wore neither, never played for the Pistons, never played in
Detroit as anything but a one-night visitor.</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 trade that sent him from the Houston Rockets to the
Pistons was voided when Sean Elliott was diagnosed with a kidney
ailment. Horry returned to Houston a changed player, the one who on
Sunday night made the three-pointer that resuscitated the Lakers'
hopes against the Sacramento Kings in the Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years after the trade that wasn't, and after two more trades
that were, Horry stood in a Laker jersey he wears well, and made the
shot that made the season.</TE>
<TE>   He has made the clutch routine, particularly in the last three
seasons, two of them championships, a third perhaps six wins away. He
said Monday afternoon that he kept those jerseys and mounted them as
a reminder that sometimes he must make his basketball about him,
because no one else will.</TE>
<TE>   It reinforced something he said Sunday evening, shortly after his
three-pointer beat the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "When that trade fell through, I came back with the attitude,
like, 'I'm going to shoot the ball regardless of what happens,'"
Horry said. "I believe in myself more than I believe in other people.
So from that point on I started taking shots."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey Hunter was in the huddle with 11.8 seconds to play Sunday,
and therefore knew the play was not drawn for Horry.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hunter turned to Brian Shaw and said, "B, I'm telling you,
Rob's going to hit this."</TE>
<TE>   Before that, Hunter had knocked Horry on the elbow and said,
"C'mon Rob, give me one, baby."</TE>
<TE>   When the shot hit, Horry looked first for Hunter in the rush of
players and coaches charging toward him, and both laughed at Hunter's
premonition.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had that feeling," Hunter said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal declined a chance to meet with the media herd
Monday afternoon. He left the floor in bare feet, limping noticeably,
without expression.</TE>
<TE>   He is experiencing his usual discomfort in his arthritic toe, the
ailment Coach Phil Jackson suggested nearly cost the Lakers in Game
4.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, referring to the layup O'Neal missed on the final
sequence, Jackson told him, "You know you had an opportunity to tie
that game up."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's response?</TE>
<TE>   "He just looked at me," Jackson said. "I'm sure he got hit across
his arm on that thing, but usually he has the power to put that back
hard and determined."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Devean George has 23 rebounds in the series, 13 on the offensive
end.... Derek Fisher is three for 19 from the three-point line.
Hunter is four for 16. George is three for 15. Rick Fox is one for
seven.</TE>

<DH>Sunday's Win Saved Title Bid; How Will Lakers Respond Now?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There would be no living to earn guessing along with these Lakers,
not when Shaquille O'Neal half-limped, half-shuffled off the practice
floor on Monday afternoon, and not when Kobe Bryant admitted with
heavy eyelids and a reasonably fresh IV prick that he was drained,
too.</LD>
<LD>   Their three-peat fears/desires have settled hard into the Western
Conference finals against the Sacramento Kings, a series tied at two
games apiece and gathering drama going into tonight's game at Arco
Arena.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers made a startling comeback and Robert Horry made a
wonderful shot in Sunday's Game 4, both unlikely considering the
rising notion that the Kings are the better team, even without Peja
Stojakovic, or at minimum playing consistently better.</LD>
<TE>   They had less than a day to bathe in their victory. The Lakers
reported for their Memorial Day practice around 4 p.m. and flew two
hours later to Sacramento for Game 5 just in time for the dinner
hour, which made everyone nervous for Bryant, who didn't come out of
the last one there so well.</TE>
<TE>   The daunting question was what the shot and the win would do for a
Laker team straining to play well and play together and play hard. On
the verge of pending elimination early Sunday evening when time
expired and the course of Horry's jump shot had not yet been
determined, the Lakers breathed again.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed something like that," Bryant said. "We haven't been
playing our best basketball."</TE>
<TE>   After a moment's thought, he concluded, "There is not a better
time for that shot to go in than it is now."</TE>
<TE>   There are, it would seem, two possible destinations, now that
Horry's jumper and Bryant's defense and O'Neal's free throws dragged
them into being competitive again.</TE>
<TE>   Only somewhat committed to this thing for going on seven months,
when they were particularly frustrated by O'Neal's physical
limitations, the Lakers could allow their new fortune to inspire
them.</TE>
<TE>   "It better," guard Lindsey Hunter said. "I think that kind of
ignited us, a game like that. That's got to add something to what
we're trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   Or, it could renew their belief that a third consecutive title was
their destiny all along, again having to be convinced of the
importance of defense and an offensive plan on a game-by-game,
quarter-by-quarter basis.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after Coach Phil Jackson had mulled a Laker response to a
two-games-to-one series deficit, they were behind by 20 points in the
first quarter, which he might have assumed was his answer. Except
that three periods later, he was standing with his fists over his
head, as joyous as any of the players and ballboys who ran to Horry's
side.</TE>
<TE>   "Miraculous," Jackson described it.</TE>
<TE>   To advance, they would have to win at least another game in
Sacramento, either tonight or in Sunday's Game 7. Game 6 is Friday
night at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Two things," Jackson said. "We got momentum on our side in the
second half, and then we were able to slow down their offense a
little bit. Those were important things for us. The shot itself or
whatever was a fortuitous thing for us. We're happy to be recipients
of that. But, it just balances out the slate. That's all that does."</TE>
<TE>   The players said they believed they would change now, that they
would return to the basketball they played for, oh, a few games at a
time during the regular season, but mostly to the game they played
last postseason.</TE>
<TE>   That would seem unlikely, given O'Neal's sore toe. But they
managed to find something in Game 1, when their shots fell and it all
looked easy--or at least fluid--for the first time in weeks. And then
again in Game 4, when the season appeared to be falling down around
them, when they did just enough to give Horry a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "A win like that builds momentum," Bryant said. "It builds
character and camaraderie on the team. It builds togetherness. That's
what wins like that do.</TE>
<TE>   "We earned it because we worked our butts off to get back in the
game. But at this point it's really irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   Game 5 will bring more dynamics, more of Bryant defending Mike
Bibby, and for how long? More inspection of O'Neal's game. More of
the possibility that Stojakovic will play. More, well, more cowbells.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson appears poised to make subtle alterations to his rotation,
in part because Derek Fisher is not shooting well, though he's not
alone in that or in his inability to stop Bibby from scoring. Still,
Fisher averaged 26.5 minutes in Games 3 and 4, after averaging 36.5
in the first two games, a notable decline.</TE>
<TE>   For sure, Jackson will be less patient with his first unit, which
has been outscored, 72-35, in the first quarters of the last two
games.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll make changes," he said, "but I don't think we'll make any
radical changes that are going to change the chemistry we put out
there on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Where it goes from there, in the final days of an already
turbulent season, is anyone's guess. They'll all find out together,
however, beginning the moment Horry's shot allowed them to start over
again, if they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "This," Horry said, "should be enough to knock the cobwebs off,
because we've been struggling all playoffs. So, we can be focused and
get some wins and get back to old Laker basketball."</TE>

<KH>Ross Newhan ON BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>Brown Hasn't Been the Staff Ace for Quite a While</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So, Kevin Brown is on the disabled list for the second time in a
month and the fifth time since March of last year, and maybe Shawn
Green better start hitting 14 or 15 homers in a week instead of nine.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the Dodgers can dodge a bullet again and Brown, with this
latest injury in the area of his surgically repaired elbow, will
return to the rotation in 15 days, as Dr. Frank Jobe said is
possible, but aren't the concerns mounting?</LD>
<LD>   At 37 and owed $45 million for three years beyond 2002 (which
underscores the risk and absurdity of a seven-year contract for a
pitcher in his 30s no matter how much insurance the Dodgers have on
him), the cold reality is that Brown hasn't been a regular member of
the rotation for two years.</LD>
<TE>   The would-be ace made only 20 starts last year and has now had his
return from Sept. 27 surgery for a torn flexor tendon in his right
elbow interrupted twice by stints on the disabled list, which Manager
Jim Tracy acknowledged to be "cause for concern just because of the
domino effect" on a rotation that will again find Omar Daal replacing
Brown and a bullpen that returned from three games in Arizona "maxed
out" by toil and trouble.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the concern goes beyond dominoes.</TE>
<TE>   Former pitching great Dave Stewart suggested as much at Dodger
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Now the pitching coach of the Milwaukee Brewers after serving as
pitching coach of the San Diego Padres when Brown went 18-7 and
helped lead that team to the National League pennant in 1998, Stewart
is familiar with the physical demands of Brown's vaunted repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   He threw some of the same pitches and helped Brown refine his.</TE>
<TE>   And now, as a concession to the elbow in his 15th big league
season, if Brown were forced to stop throwing the sinker, slider or
split-finger, Stewart said he wouldn't be the same pitcher,
especially if it was his signature sinker.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a surgically repaired elbow, it's any elbow,"
Stewart said. "All of those pitches put a great deal of pressure and
strain on an arm, and we all know that Kevin is not a halfway guy.
He's an all-or-nothing guy. There's no in between.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in high gear all the time, which is what everyone admires
about him."</TE>
<TE>   There are the three years left on his contract.</TE>
<TE>   There is the Dodgers' obvious need for him over the remainder of
the current season.</TE>
<TE>   There is the possibility that a combination of the no-give Brown
and the stress of his repertoire on a recovering elbow could
overpower any therapy program.</TE>
<TE>   "What's Kevin, 37?" Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   "This seems like a great setback now because the Dodgers have been
basically without him for a year and a half, but my guess is that
he's going to be healthy enough at some point to honor his contract
and pitch very well.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of respect for him. I know all about his intensity
and determination, and I hope he'll take care of himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing when to back off is the issue now, and I think that if
the Dodgers take the time to allow him to get healthy now, they'll
get good benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I should say, if he allows himself to get healthy."</TE>
<TE>   That indeed may be the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers deny it, but the perception is that Brown was allowed
to set his own rehabilitation course during spring training,
ultimately insisting on pitching the season opener when he might not
have been ready and eventually going on the disabled list April 20
after tearing scar tissue in his elbow.</TE>
<TE>   And now, even while warming up for Sunday's start in Arizona,
Brown apparently recognized he wasn't 100% but still went to the
mound.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Stan Johnston told reporters after that 10-9 loss that
Brown had expressed discomfort in the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Monday if he was aware of that, an uncharacteristically
testy Tracy said he wasn't and wondered if the inquiring reporter was
trying to "create something."</TE>
<TE>   A disconsolate Brown, back on the disabled list, stood at his
locker and said: "There's no one in this room who hasn't tried to
play in pain. I was hoping [Sunday] that it was just stiffness and I
could work through it and get better, but that was not the case."</TE>
<TE>   Brown will have an MRI test today.</TE>
<TE>   Jobe said Monday that he felt Brown had suffered pinched lining
and a muscle sprain behind the elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Given this new development and the sudden complexities of his
pitching staff (which the Dodgers addressed with the recall of Bryan
Corey), Tracy's mood, perhaps, could be excused.</TE>
<TE>   With Terry Mulholland and Jesse Orosco on the disabled list and
his relief corps having been forced to make 195 pitches Sunday, with
Daal having thrown 97 in the last two games and now ticketed to start
Saturday in place of Brown, the pitching staff that has carried so
much of the 2002 burden has been showing signs of fraying and needed
Hideo Nomo to provide some innings in the holiday opener of a
three-game series with the Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo responded, overcoming seven walks (a taxed bullpen was the
last resort) to go seven innings in a 5-3 win featuring Green's 13th
home run and first of the new week, thrilling a crowd of 32,491 that
provided the slugging right fielder with standing ovations before and
during the game.</TE>
<TE>   If Think Green is the new theme at Chavez Ravine, there's still
Brown, who will miss at least two starts and said his new injuries
may not be directly related to the surgery but are undoubtedly the
result of having surgery.</TE>
<TE>   He recognizes he had to go on the disabled list given the club's
pitching shortage coming out of Arizona and the uncertainty
surrounding his own availability, and, in regard to what lies ahead,
he shook his head and said, "I'm not trying to predict the future
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The admittedly frustrated Brown, and the Dodgers, will know more
after today's MRI.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans reflected on the pitcher's second
flare-up of the season and said, "I'm not nervous or apprehensive. I
don't want to jump to any conclusions without knowing the result of
the MRI. Injuries happen.</TE>
<TE>   "You know going in you're going to average 15 to 20 DL placements
and hope you can overcome them.</TE>
<TE>   "As I've said before, we're fortunate to have a guy like Omar Daal
who can step right in again. He's excelled all season, which is why
we didn't deal him."</TE>
<TE>   It is the Dodger ace who has been dealt another blow.</TE>
<TE>   Will it prove to be the last for Kevin Brown or simply the latest?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California had a quiet confidence and Jocelyn Forest, which was
enough to defeat tradition-laden Arizona in the NCAA softball
championship game at Oklahoma City.</LD>
<LD>   Forest threw a one-hitter, and California scored six runs in the
seventh inning against ace Jennie Finch to defeat the Wildcats, 6-0,
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We came out here wanting to play. Just being here wasn't good
enough for us," said Forest, the tournament's outstanding player.</LD>
<TE>   "We proved a point. People underestimate us all the time and we're
definitely the underdogs. Nobody ever believes in us," she said. "The
only people that have ever believed in us is ourselves, and we came
out here and did the job."</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Bears (56-19), who wrapped up their fourth consecutive
appearance in the Women's College World Series, had never won more
than two games in any of their six appearances. Arizona (55-12) has
six NCAA championships and has been to the title game 10 times.</TE>
<TE>   But California had won two of three from the Wildcats during the
regular season, and that confidence carried over.</TE>
<TE>   Finch (34-6), the player of the year in 2001 when she had a 32-0
record and Arizona won the title, retired the first two batters in
the seventh before Kaleo Eldredge walked. Kristen Morley followed
with a single, then Candace Harper singled up the middle to make it
1-0.</TE>
<TE>   After an intentional walk to Veronica Nelson loaded the bases,
Finch walked in a run before giving up a bases-clearing double to
Jessica Pamanian.</TE>
<TE>   Finch was replaced by Jenny Gladding, who gave up a double to
Chelsea Spencer that finished the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Forest (29-12) struck out eight and walked three.</TE>
<TE>   Lacrosse</TE>
<TE>   Michael Powell had four goals and three assists, and Syracuse
avenged a loss in last year's title game by defeating
defending-champion Princeton, 13-12, to win the NCAA lacrosse
championship at Piscataway, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Solliday had three goals and an assist, and defender Sol
Bliss made two key plays late in the fourth quarter to help Syracuse
(15-2) win its seventh title and second in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Hartofilis had three goals for Princeton (10-5).</TE>
<TE>   Running</TE>
<TE>   Nazario Romero of San Marcos was the men's winner and Jeanne
Lasee-Johnson of Chula Vista finished first among the women in the
FloJo Half-Marathon and 5K at Laguna Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Romero finished in 1 hour 9 minutes 1 second, defeating Gray
Mavhera of Riverside by one second, and Lasee-Johnson finished in
1:20:45. Romero and Lasee-Johnson each received $250.</TE>
<TE>   Sharlene Wills, who is blind and ran with friend Jonathan Geller,
finished in an estimated 2:52:00. She ran with her guide dog, Shyla,
in last year's race.</TE>

<HD>Forsberg Puts One Over on Red Wings</HD>
<DH>Hockey: His breakaway goal in overtime lifts Avalanche to
2-1 victory and 3-2 series lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Peter Forsberg once again showed why he may be the best hockey player
in the world.</LD>
<LD>   The native of Sweden scored 6:24 into overtime to give the
Colorado Avalanche a 2-1 victory over Detroit on Monday night and a
3-2 lead in the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   Forsberg, who also had an assist, is the leading scorer in the
playoffs with 27 points despite missing the regular season after
having four foot surgeries and his spleen removed in the last year.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just unbelievable," Colorado Coach Bob Hartley said. "Even
after missing the whole year, he continues to rise up to challenges
and pressure. He's the full package as a player."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman said the officials missed an offsides
call on the game-winning goal, which was scored on a breakaway as the
Red Wings got caught on a line change.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a quick play, a hard call," Bowman said. "You're not going
to cry over a call like that."</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg said he didn't know if teammate Brian Willsie was
offsides, but he did know that he didn't expect to have so much room
on the play that turned into his third career overtime playoff goal.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't usually get breakaways in OT," said Forsberg, who has
nine goals and 18 assists in the playoffs. "I was a little nervous,
but I got it done."</TE>
<TE>   The defending Stanley Cup champions can eliminate the Red Wings
and move a step closer to repeating with a victory in Game 6
Wednesday night in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to play smarter," said Detroit's Steve Yzerman, who tied
the score early in the third period. "We have to play our positions.
We can't go running all over the ice."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado and Detroit played their third overtime game of the
series--the sixth in their postseason rivalry since 1996--and the
road team won for the sixth time.</TE>
<TE>   "It must just be coincidence," Colorado's Joe Sakic said.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado, which was outshot, 4-1, in the overtime, became the
first team in the series to win consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Roy made 26 saves for Colorado and Dominik Hasek turned
away 27 shots for Detroit.</TE>

<HD>Santiago, Bonds Step Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When 37-year-old catcher Benito Santiago landed on second base for
the third time Monday, he smiled and pointed toward the San Francisco
Giant dugout. Manager Dusty Baker pointed back.</LD>
<LD>   Santiago had three doubles and drove in four runs, Reggie Sanders
had a two-run homer and Barry Bonds hit a solo homer, and the Giants
defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, 7-3, at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   "I just pointed to Dusty and the whole group to say, 'See? We're
doing great,'" Santiago said.</LD>
<TE>   Santiago's three-run double helped the Giants end a three-game
losing streak and move within one game of the defending World
Series-champion Diamondbacks in the National League West.</TE>
<TE>   "I was excited," Baker said about returning the gesture. "We all
were. We needed those runs.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times have we not driven in those runs?"</TE>
<TE>   Santiago went three for four, extending his hitting streak to 12
games. He is batting .420 during the run. His three doubles matches a
franchise record, last reached by catcher Doug Mirabelli on June 24,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The game attracted 42,005, the largest crowd ever at Pacific Bell
Park, and Bonds treated them with a fifth-inning homer, his 585th,
putting him within one of Frank Robinson for fourth on the career
list.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds has 18 home runs this season to match Chicago's Sammy Sosa
for the major-league lead. He has homered in six of his last 10
games.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Chicago 2--Keith Osik's first pinch hit this season
drove in Jack Wilson from third base with the winning run against
Antonio Alfonseca in the 10th inning at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Cub right-hander Mark Prior, the No. 2 pick in last year's draft
out of USC, struck out seven and gave up one run and three hits in
six innings. He was clocked as high as 99 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Pirate left-hander Dave Williams (3-5)--in danger of being demoted
to the minors--shut out the Cubs on three hits in 5 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had given up 19 earned runs in 20 2/3 innings over five
consecutive winless starts.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Houston 3--Tino Martinez hit a two-run homer against
Roy Oswalt in the eighth inning at Houston and the Cardinals won for
the eighth time in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Berkman homered twice for the Astros, including a two-run
drive in the eighth that pulled Houston within one run. He has 17
home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, Montreal 1--Tom Glavine pitched a five-hitter and
Rafael Furcal drove in two runs at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine (8-2) extended his scoreless streak against the Expos to
32 innings before Jose Vidro hit a solo home run with one out in the
ninth to extend his hitting streak to 21 games.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine struck out eight, walked none and lowered his earned-run
average to a major league-leading 1.59.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 5, New York 3--Luis Castillo extended his hitting streak
to 15 games with two run-scoring singles and had two of the Marlins'
seven stolen bases at New York.</TE>
<TE>   All the steals came against Mike Piazza, who has thrown out only
four runners in 43 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 8, Colorado 5--Ryan Klesko homered and drove in two runs
for the host Padres, who took advantage of another meltdown by Mike
Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton (2-6), baseball's highest-paid pitcher with a
$121-million, eight-year contract, had a 3-0 lead in the fourth
inning, but gave up three runs each in the bottom of the fourth and
fifth and seven hits and four walks.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander gave up six runs and nine hits in 4 2/3 innings,
and walked five for the fourth consecutive game.</TE>

<HD>Rogge Weighs In on IOC Outlook</HD>
<DH>Olympics: From state of the upcoming Games to TV
negotiations to Baldwin's replacement to drug testing, president
gives his views.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>Progress in preparations for the 2004 Athens Olympics is
"heartening," plans for the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy, are
"quiet and normal," and the 2008 Beijing Olympics offer the "prospect
of a superb Games," International Olympic Committee President Jacques
Rogge said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In what amounted to a presidential sketch of the state of the
Olympic movement, Rogge, speaking at the end of a week of meetings
with the IOC executive board and the 199-member Assn. of National
Olympic Committee, also said that the IOC is embarking upon a "period
of consolidation" after 20 years of expansion fueled by skyrocketing
sponsorship deals and television contracts. The IOC's financial
situation is solid but, he said, needs to be "stabilized" in case of
some unforeseen crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Rogge also urged the U.S. Olympic Committee not to work in haste
in selecting a replacement for former president Sandra Baldwin, who
resigned Friday after discrepancies were revealed in her academic
record in her self-supplied USOC biography. Now that the Salt Lake
City Olympics--the last in the United States for at least 10
years--are over, he said, "There's no call for having someone elected
this evening."</LD>
<TE>   Rogge's remarks indicated clearly that, after nearly a year in
office, he is comfortably in charge of the IOC--in particular, easily
conversant with virtually every facet of the Olympic movement--and
that the IOC, for the first time in years, has the luxury of trying
to set its agenda, rather than reacting to scandal or crisis. Having
weathered the Salt Lake City corruption scandal, and put in place a
50-point package of reforms--a plan that will be fine-tuned at an
all-delegates meeting in November in Mexico City--the IOC now looks
ahead with television and sponsor deals locked into place for years
to come, many through 2008. The IOC's single-largest financial
underwriter, NBC, is paying $3.5 billion for the U.S. rights to the
Games from 2000 through 2008.</TE>
<TE>   The 2010 Winter Games represent the next television deal to be
negotiated. If economic indicators pick up, Rogge said, the IOC might
elect to commence negotiations for those Games as soon as this
winter. Vancouver, Canada, and Salzburg, Austria, are considered the
leading candidates among eight applicants.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if such indicators remain sluggish, and the IOC
has taken keen note of the recently declared bankruptcy of
Swiss-based sports marketing agency ISL, the IOC might wait to
negotiate until 2005 or even 2006, after the Turin Winter Olympics,
he said. At any rate, having taken stock of the IOC's locked-in
financial position, the time has come, Rogge said, to consolidate the
IOC's considerable gains rather than pursue expansion. The Olympic
movement is now a $1-billion-a-year enterprise; 20 years ago, before
Peter Ueberroth and the 1984 Los Angeles Games showed the IOC how to
capitalize on sponsor and TV dollars, its financial position was
precarious.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge did not spell out in detail the contours of such
"consolidation." But he said the course was set last summer, shortly
after he was elected to an eight-year term, succeeding Juan Antonio
Samaranch of Spain, adding, "We were comforted [by our decision] or
in a way proven to be right with the [terrorist attacks of] 11
September, which of course posed a threat to sports organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very glad to have good Games," in Salt Lake City, "but
consider a situation where 11 September would have been 29 January, a
week before the Olympic Games. I'm not quite sure we would have had
Olympic Games."</TE>
<TE>   Noted Rogge: "We want to make sure we have a safe financial
situation that could absorb either an organizational problem or an
economic crisis." A moment later, he added that the IOC also wants to
"dampen the economic cycle that goes up and down and absorb a shock
that I hope will never happen."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most significant threat to the credibility of the
movement remains athletes' use of performance-enhancing substances.
The executive board imposed sanctions here on two Austrian
cross-country skiers, their coach and chiropractor for blood-doping
offenses during the Salt Lake Games.</TE>
<TE>   The coach, Walter Mayer, and chiropractor, Volker Muller, were
declared ineligible for the Olympics through the 2010 Games. "The
fight against doping is one of our priorities," IOC Director General
Francois Carrard said. "2010 is certainly severe, but it's a strong
message."</TE>
<TE>   The athletes, Marc Mayer and Achim Walker, were disqualified from
the 2002 Games. The Austrian Olympic Committee was also issued a
"strong" warning. The two Austrian athletes bring to seven the number
of doping cases from the Salt Lake Games. In Olympic Winter Games
from Chamonix in 1924 through Nagano in 1998, there were a total of
five doping cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that a sign of more doping?" Rogge said. "No. It's a sign
we're testing more and better."</TE>
<TE>   Some 1,980 athletes were tested in Salt Lake City; only 600 were
tested in Nagano.</TE>

<HD>Comets Tail Off Against Sparks</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: After Houston starts quickly, L.A. tightens
vise to win overwhelmingly, 68-55.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Whenever the Sparks and Comets get together for some hoops it's
usually not just a game, it's an event.</LD>
<LD>   But rarely has Los Angeles made four-time WNBA champion Houston
look as ordinary as the Comets did in the Sparks' 68-55 victory
Monday, before 12,697 at the Compaq Center.</LD>
<LD>   Opening the season with consecutive victories, the Sparks--the
2001 champions--defensively bottled up the Comets so effectively they
might as well been scrimmaging North Texas State.</LD>
<TE>   Houston forward Sheryl Swoopes, the 2000 most valuable player
playing her first game in a year after recovering from a torn
ligament in her right knee, had 15 points. But the dominant player on
the floor was 2001 league MVP Lisa Leslie, who had her second
consecutive double-double with 22 points and 17 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Even Coach Michael Cooper, who is haunted by his team's previous
failures against the Comets, couldn't bring himself to crow.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good Houston Comet team that still has the pride of a
champion. They came out and gave us everything they had," Cooper
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But was this a statement game? No. It was a good game to start
the road trip. We're going to have to see this team again once they
get their chemistry jelling, and we know it will be harder fought
game."</TE>
<TE>   It should have been on Monday, but it was hardly memorable.</TE>
<TE>   Houston, riding the emotional return of Swoopes for their season
opener, made 10 of their first 12 shots. They only made nine shots
(out of 40) for the rest of the game. When Houston had the ball, the
Sparks switched their defenses so quickly and consistently the Comets
always seemed to be shooting with no view of the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason Houston had to work so hard was it got no relief
from its bench. The five starters scored all 55 points. And the
Sparks had no problems on the boards, outrebounding the Comets,
41-24.</TE>
<TE>   "Our defense has always been the key for our victories," said
DeLisha Milton, who had 15 points while shuttling back and forth on
defense between Swoopes and Tina Thompson. "And the thing I love
about this team the most, everyone takes it upon herself to be a
defensive stopper. You can look at our faces; when we get beat on a
play we're mad."</TE>
<TE>   Houston Coach Van Chancellor said it was the best defense he had
seen Los Angeles play against his team in the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "They are tough and really, really good," Chancellor said. "They
were in championship form. We've got to try and catch them. They're
already there."</TE>
<TE>   The Comets came into the game with a 15-11 franchise record
against the Sparks. But Los Angeles won four of the five meetings
last year, including a 2-0 sweep in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   That was without Swoopes in the Houston lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "Sheryl brings a whole new dimension and perspective to our team,"
said Thompson, who had 14 points. "It was very obvious she wasn't
there last year. But she's added a lot of things to her game that
complement our game, as well as our team camaraderie and chemistry.
We had to have her back because the level of talent and greatness she
exudes."</TE>
<TE>   That confidence Swoopes inspires was evident early. Houston bolted
to an 8-0 lead, helped by two Thompson three-pointers. The Comets'
lead eventually grew to 22-14 as Swoopes had six points, three
rebounds and four assists with 11:29 to go in the half.</TE>
<TE>   After that the Comets might has well been throwing the ball
against a wall.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks stormed past Houston with a 23-4 run, stretched over
nine minutes, to take a 37-26 lead. Leslie scored 10 of her 18
first-half points during the outburst.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the one advantage the Comets always had over us is they
knew how to win," Leslie said. "But once you win a championship, we
know those different levels, and how to stay in tune with them. We
are a veteran team now. We're very seasoned and poised. We're not
going to beat ourselves anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "When they jumped out on us we were like, 'Be patient, don't force
it, just stick with our game plan.' And we did that."</TE>
<TE>   Swoopes made the final two baskets of the half to keep Houston in
sight, 37-30. But that's all Houston could do in the second
half--watch the Sparks snatch away the game the same way the Sparks
snatched away their title last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a lot better team than we showed offensively and
defensively today," Swoopes said.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's down to a three-game series for the Lakers and Sacramento Kings,
which means there's no more time for excuses.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Jackson, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and the rest of the
Lakers will be remembered either as champions who brought their "A"
game when needed most or as a team whose title run came to a crashing
halt.</LD>
<LD>   Rick Adelman, Chris Webber, Vlade Divac and the Kings will be
remembered either as the group that finally dethroned the two-time
NBA champions or as a team destined to always come up a quarter
short.</LD>
<TE>   This is NBA playoff pressure at its best. This is the time of year
that separated Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird from
Dominique Wilkins, John Stockton and George Gervin, skilled players
who never played on a championship team.</TE>
<TE>   If we've learned anything from the first four games of the Western
Conference finals, it is that the Lakers have as much pride as talent
and that the Kings still lack a little killer instinct.</TE>
<TE>   But over a seven-game series, it's not how you start, it's how you
finish. A breakdown of Game 5:</TE>
<TE>   KINGS' MOVE--After outplaying the Lakers in two games at Staples
Center, the Kings should be upset that they are not up, 3-1. But they
are even, and Adelman has to make sure his players have put Sunday's
100-99 loss behind them before they play their biggest game of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   With Webber as a team leader, the Kings always have been a cocky
bunch, but they can't afford to be too overconfident tonight. The
worst thing Sacramento can do is start underestimating the Lakers,
who are capable of raising their game to a much higher level.</TE>
<TE>   In Games 2, 3 and 4, the Kings looked great when they were
knocking down shots as the result of great ball movement and an
opportunistic defense. But even though the Kings jumped out to early
leads, they faded late in the second halves when the Lakers made
things more difficult for Mike Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   If Bryant is called on to defend Bibby as he did Sunday, the Kings
should move Bibby to a shooting guard role and have him run around as
many screens as possible. This might deplete Bryant's energy on
offense, and backup point guard Bobby Jackson and Webber can run the
King offense.</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--Maybe Jackson should hold an intrasquad scrimmage
before the start of tonight's game. That may be the only way to get
the Lakers warmed up in time so they don't fall behind by double
digits in the first quarter as they've done in the last two games.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers should be motivated to use Sacramento's raucous Arco
Arena crowd against the Kings. The Lakers are a veteran team and
should know that if the Kings fall behind early, the pressure from
their fans will work against them, as it has already in the playoffs.
The Kings may have been a beast at Arco during the regular season but
they are only 4-3 there this postseason. It's a potential edge for
the Lakers, who love winning crucial playoff games on the road. They
did it at Portland and Indiana in 2000 and at Philadelphia last
season.</TE>
<TE>   By having Bryant defend Sacramento's point guards, the Lakers'
intensity on defense immediately picks up. On-the-ball pressure
defense makes the Kings work harder to get into their offensive sets
and cuts down their time to make the extra pass. It's important for
the Lakers to force Sacramento into tougher shots because the Kings
shoot too well when given open looks.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINTS--The Lakers made strong second-half comebacks in the
two games over the weekend because they dominated on the offensive
boards. They had 19 offensive rebounds to Sacramento's 10 in Game 3,
which L.A. finished with a 52-46 rebounding edge. Sunday, 25 of the
Lakers' 56 rebounds were on offense, and only eight of the Kings' 42
were taken at the offensive end.</TE>
<TE>   Give Jackson credit for sticking with his bench. Devean George,
Lindsey Hunter, Brian Shaw and Samaki Walker all have been ice-cold
shooting, but each is contributing with overlooked plays, such as
offensive rebounds. In Game 4, George pulled down seven offensive
boards, while Walker and Hunter stepped up with strong second-half
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   It will be interesting to see how the series' bench matchups will
be affected if swingman Peja Stojakovic is able to make his first
appearance of the series for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic, sidelined since May 9 because of an ankle sprain, is
close to returning and if he does, Hedu Turkoglu would become a force
on Sacramento's second unit.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If the heart question hadn't already been answered definitively, Phil
Jackson got to it the other day. The Lakers' coach came to an
interview a few minutes after watching Robert Horry launch the kind
of shot that would break a weak-willed team, and someone asked him
whether he believed the Kings--conference finals neophytes, with no
heroic history to lean on, still on the upside of the postseason
learning curve--might be vulnerable in that regard.</LD>
<LD>   "Of course I hope that's true," Jackson quickly replied, "but this
is a [Sacramento] team that showed poise. I mean, they hit some big,
tough shots down the stretch, coming into the gut of the game.</LD>
<LD>   "We just made bigger plays."</LD>
<TE>   And that's it, of course. That's the thing. It isn't about the
heart in the here and now; it's about the head. It isn't in the
chest; it's between the ears.</TE>
<TE>   It just isn't about guts anymore. If you've stayed awake through
even a week's worth of games in this postseason, long enough either
to watch Sacramento on the road in Salt Lake City or Dallas, you know
the Kings passed Go on that issue a while back.</TE>
<TE>   What it is, tonight at Arco Arena, is absolutely, positively about
plays.</TE>
<TE>   From the start of the Western Conference finals (and for roughly a
thousand years before that, for those King fans scoring at home), one
of the primary questions surrounding Sacramento's NBA entry was
whether it had the intestinal fortitude to survive the kind of
semi-chaos that a bunch like the Lakers can induce in a team.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, it's your basic chin music. The heart question is such a
cheap trap that at this point you can't imagine anyone actually
falling for it; but this is Sacramento, and these are the Kings, a
bunch that always has been susceptible to reflexive defensiveness
about the whole Tin Man thing.</TE>
<TE>   This just in: Doesn't matter now. This Sacramento team, this one
right here, has plenty of heart--and had it even through that
gruesome Game 4 finish, the 100-99 thunderbolt that came zinging out
of the low L.A. sky.</TE>
<TE>   It lost all the same.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings weren't failed by their constitutions; they were
outplayed down the stretch. Mike Bibby didn't come out of the locker
room for the second half, take a deep breath and realize he was in
over his head. What happened to Bibby was Kobe Bryant, not frayed
nerves.</TE>
<TE>   By now it is entirely evident that, however this series finishes
up, these two teams are rough equals. The Kings are more talented top
to bottom; the Lakers are possessed of two game-changing players
before you even get to a bloodless last-shot artist like Horry.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have a champion's heart; the Kings are attempting to
grow one. But it's awfully close to a draw in the area of will, and
that game on Sunday was decided on a play-by-play basis through the
second half, not in one manic burst of momentum by L.A. nor a sudden
loss of cabin pressure along the Sacramento side.</TE>

<HD>HALO AND GOOD BUY</HD>
<DH>Watkins believes Angels have a huge upside, although doubts
about his finances persist</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT and BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>The photograph comes from another time, an unthinkable place, but
Donald Watkins believes its subjects speak to him.</LD>
<LD>   They are his mother's ancestors, slaves who belonged to an Irish
family in Clinton, Miss. The owners taught them and their children to
read and documented their existence in that 1857 photo, which Watkins
keeps in a place of pride in his bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   Every day, before he goes to work and before he goes to sleep, he
asks them if he has made them proud.</LD>
<TE>   It is for them and his 85-year-old mother, Lillian, that Watkins
wants to buy the Angels from Disney and become the first African
American to own a majority stake of a major league baseball team. It
is for a family that was rooted in slavery but whose last five
generations, he said, have attended college.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, 53, is an Alabama businessman who privately puts his net
worth at $1.5 billion, a figure that has been widely questioned but
not disproved. He would spend about $250 million to buy the Angels,
but what dollar value can be placed on closing the circle from
slavery to ownership of a team in the most American of pastimes?</TE>
<TE>   "It's the completion of a journey that started in the 1800s," he
said. "It's very special to me and my family, and I want to get it
soon."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the year, he hopes to close the proposed purchase
and win approval from Major League Baseball. Disney hasn't given him
exclusive negotiating rights, but while company executive Paul
Pressler said people have "come through and kicked the tires,"
Watkins is the only confirmed suitor.</TE>
<TE>   "I like my chances," he said, crediting baseball Commissioner Bud
Selig and influential Chicago White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf with
shepherding him through the process. "I think I want it more than
anyone else, and determination is not capable of objective
measurement. I won't let anybody outwork me for this opportunity. I
will hit all of the benchmarks I have to hit to make it happen."</TE>
<TE>   Selig declined to comment on Watkins' chances and was guarded when
asked if Watkins is a legitimate buyer. "We haven't gotten into that
kind of detail, but he's a man who's spent a lot of time talking to a
lot of people, including me," Selig said. "So I think he's quite
serious about this."</TE>
<TE>   A former Montgomery, Ala., city councilman and civil rights
attorney, Watkins envisions the Angels as the cornerstone of a
Southern California business empire that would include a broadcast
media outlet for sports and entertainment programming, a bank and a
life insurance company.</TE>
<TE>   He believes the Angels, winless in three American League
Championship Series appearances, can enhance the value of those
businesses. He believes the market can support a well-run,
well-promoted team.</TE>
<TE>   Although many owners--including Disney--claim to lose money, he
thinks he can make a profit "if we do it right." And while he
believes baseball must "get a handle on salaries," he said his offer
isn't contingent on owners and players agreeing on a new labor
contract.</TE>
<TE>   He envisions the Angels assembling a roster of humble,
team-oriented, fan-friendly players who will become World Series
champions. "I think we can get there in three years," he said during
recent conversations in Birmingham and Los Angeles. "The [Arizona]
Diamondbacks did it, and they were an expansion team. They did it in
what, four years? We ought to be able to do it in three....</TE>
<TE>   "The Dodgers won't be the dominant team in this market for much
longer. I'm focused on the right team. I'm going to make the Angels a
national team. A lot of people will be wearing Angel paraphernalia
all over in Atlanta, New Orleans, Latin America. Wearing a uniform
will be special. It will be something that major league players
aspire to."</TE>
<TE>   Unquestionably, Watkins dreams big.</TE>
<TE>   Or is he fantasizing?</TE>
<TE>   A highly placed baseball official told The Times no one knows if
Watkins has the money to make this deal because most of his assets
are in privately held companies and are difficult to verify. However,
Watkins has said he has a credit agreement letter for $200 million in
financing as well as liquidation agreements on his assets that will
give him $50 million to put in at closing.</TE>
<TE>   According to Watkins, the credit agreement letter is from an
investment firm that acts as a middleman between him and banks that
work with Major League Baseball. He's not fronting for anyone, he
said, and he's not seeking investors because he wants total operating
control.</TE>
<TE>   Repeated scrutiny of his finances hasn't produced a clear picture.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes magazine this year didn't rank Watkins among its richest
400 Americans, a ladder with a lowest rung of $600 million. Forbes
couldn't quantify his non-publicly held assets and reporter Monte
Burke said of Watkins' purported $1.5-billion net worth, "we have
reason to doubt the number."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins said he doesn't need Forbes to certify his wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never sought inclusion on any list Forbes compiles, nor
have I asked the magazine to confirm my net worth," he said in a
letter to Forbes' editor. "It is my goal, however, to be listed as
one of 30 Major League Baseball owners. Major League Baseball has a
comprehensive and detailed description of my financial assets. I must
persuade the League, and not Mr. Burke, that I have the financial
strength to buy and operate a baseball team."</TE>
<TE>   Those in Watkins' inner circle are confident he would be a dynamic
and innovative owner.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe and know that any team he would acquire, he would have
the focus and the resources to be able to be very, very successful,"
said Milton Davis, a Tuskegee, Ala., attorney and sometime business
partner.</TE>
<TE>   "I have great confidence that Donald Watkins would be to baseball
what Tiger Woods is to golf."</TE>
<TE>   Most questions about Watkins stem from his refusal to detail his
private holdings and his insistence his finances are too complex for
all but a few experts to comprehend.</TE>
<TE>   He says he made extensive investments in energy-related
businesses, and once valued them at $500 million to $600 million--a
figure he later revised downward. He also owns some oil wells. He is
a co-founder of Alamerica Bank, a Birmingham commercial bank with
about $40 million in assets. That's modest, but he said the
2-year-old bank was profitable enough for him to begin the process of
acquiring compatible institutions late last year.</TE>
<TE>   One of his companies has a small interest in Masada Energy
Resources, which focuses on turning waste into ethanol. He is a
director of eChapman, a Baltimore-based investment banking and
brokerage firm. He also owns and publishes Voter News Network, a
political newsletter. A political independent, he plans to bring
Voter News Network to California and become politically active.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his varied businesses, he does not network or make the
social scene in Birmingham. Judy Haise, society columnist for the
Birmingham News, said she has never seen him at a party, charity
event or social function there, although she has been told he has
funded scholarships for deserving students.</TE>
<TE>   Public records show Watkins has modest mortgages on a residence he
owns in Birmingham, where he does most of his business, and another
in Montgomery, where his family lives.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Springfield, a spokeswoman for the Birmingham Chamber of
Commerce, called him the city's unknown billionaire.</TE>
<TE>   "He does nothing with the Chamber or the local business
community," she said. "When [his offer for the Angels] was in the
paper, it was news to us he had the money to do it. We don't know
anything about how he got that much money.... People that have lived
here for years and years know nothing about him."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, a neat but casual dresser who wears no jewelry other than
a watch, doesn't mind being relatively anonymous. Nor does he mind
questions about his wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "The real question is, are you going to have your money at
closing? And I'm satisfied that I've carried my burden on that," he
said. "I've never failed to have my money at closing in any business
transaction in 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins and his five siblings were reared in Montgomery. His late
father, Levi, was president of Alabama State University, where Donald
was later a trustee. A brother, Levi Jr., is a heart surgeon at Johns
Hopkins University.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Southern Illinois University, he got his law
degree at Alabama and practiced law in Montgomery. Among his most
prominent cases was helping get a pardon in 1976 for Clarence Norris,
the last survivor of the Scottsboro Boys, nine African American men
who were unjustly convicted of raping two white women in 1931.</TE>
<TE>   His work caught the eye of Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington Jr.,
who had known Watkins' father. Arrington hired Watkins as his legal
counsel, a job that reportedly paid Watkins $8 million to $10 million
by the time Arrington left office in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "In the courtroom, he's a very aggressive but highly successful
attorney," Arrington said. "Uncharacteristic of most attorneys, he
speaks openly about his cases, and the fact he won so many might have
made him some enemies."</TE>
<TE>   He undoubtedly made enemies when he represented Auburn football
player Eric Ramsey in a 1991 case that led to the resignation of
Coach Pat Dye and the school's placement on probation by the NCAA.
Ramsey had tapes of coaches and boosters offering him money and a
loan, and Watkins did a masterful job of gaining media attention for
the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people will probably never forgive him for that," Arrington
said.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins also received attention for his plan to raise Alabama
State to Division I-A status. He talked of building a stadium and
museum by raising $90 million, some of it from the sultan of Brunei
and the king of Tonga. The money never materialized, and he resigned
from the board of trustees last year.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins was more successful with Alamerica, which was profitable
within five months of opening its doors in January 2000. Lawrence
Tate, a bank co-founder and acquaintance of 25 years, said Watkins is
particularly skilled at generating cash flow and is capable of buying
and operating a major league team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he has received more speculation than perhaps others
would. I don't know why," Tate said. "He's an extraordinary
individual who is quite bright, persistent, determined and
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Except, so far, at buying a team.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins began his pursuit a year ago by inquiring about the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays, expecting to spend about $150 million. When the club
came off the market, he looked at the Minnesota Twins, attracted by
e-mails from fans beseeching him to rescue the cash-strapped team
from the clutches of owner Carl Pohlad.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins said he'd pay $125 million to $150 million and privately
finance a new stadium to save the Twins from contraction, and he
spent the Saturday before Christmas at the Mall of America meeting
fans. His efforts were stymied when Pohlad said he preferred to sell
to a local buyer, even though none has appeared.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins' finances came into question again a few weeks ago, when
Twin President Jerry Bell said in a letter to Minnesota legislators
no interested party "with adequate resources to consummate a
transaction" had emerged. If Watkins had proven his net worth, Bell
said, "I can unequivocally assure you that he would have every
opportunity to become the owner of the team."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins said neither Bell nor Pohlad asked him for a
clarification.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been in a situation like that, where you submit an
expression of interest and there's absolutely no questions regarding
your expression of interest," Watkins said. By contrast, he described
his dealings with Disney as "very professional.... They have a lot of
class as a company."</TE>
<TE>   He turned his focus to the Angels this winter. Initially reluctant
to spend more than $150 million, he decided to make a financial leap
after making enough baseball contacts and learning about the sport's
economics. He wouldn't say if Disney had countered his original offer
or disclose other details of their negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and business associates believe he can pull it off, and
with panache.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people say, 'Show me the money,' and he knows that,"
said William Parker, a member of the Alabama House and a Watkins
confidant. "There are skeptics in everything that's successful, and I
think he has proven them wrong....</TE>
<TE>   "His bank is successful. He's practiced law and been successful.
People need to stop underestimating him and start looking at his
track record. I think he'd be a great fit with Anaheim and he'd be a
hands-on owner, like Mark Cuban with the Dallas Mavericks, Jerry
Jones with the Cowboys and George Steinbrenner with the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not his largest venture, but it's something he really
wants."</TE>
<TE>   Davis scoffed at suggestions from critics who say Watkins is after
publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "His name has been in the paper for 25 years for significant
matters," Davis said. "He has excelled in all of his endeavors."</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels' owner, Watkins said he will sit in the stands, buy
food from Edison Field concessions and use public rest rooms "because
that's the ultimate quality control check." He will put some of his
kids to work--he has four sons and a daughter, ages 6 to 29--at jobs
that would teach them the business from the bottom up.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he has some front-office candidates in mind, though
he wouldn't identify them, and he will consider keeping current
employees who share his goals. "To go from the Disney Channel to the
Watkins Channel, that should be fine-tuning," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like Disney, Watkins says he loves the synergy of owning companies
with interests that seem to mesh. But unlike Disney, whose movie and
TV magic didn't make its baseball and hockey operations profitable,
he believes he can make it work.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels is a small unit in a huge global corporation [to
Disney]," he said, "and in my world, the Angels is a cherished family
prize, to be treated as such and to be passed on to generations. It's
not a simple business transaction."</TE>

<HD>George Cooper, 85; One of 1st Black Naval Officers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He would always recall walking through the train station in Chicago
just hours after being commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy
and how time seemed to stop as commuters stared--first at his crisp
uniform and then with astonishment at the man wearing it. It was 1944
and the reason for their reaction was simple: No other black man had
ever worn the uniform of an officer in the U.S. Navy.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   George C. Cooper, one of the last survivors of the "Golden
Thirteen," the first group of African Americans to be commissioned as
active-duty line officers in the U.S. Navy, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<TE>   Cooper died May 20 at a retirement complex in Centerville, Ohio, a
suburb of Dayton. He had been in failing health for some time but the
cause of death was not announced.</TE>
<TE>   With no plans to make history, Cooper was a chief petty officer
training metal smiths for the Navy at his alma mater, Hampton
Institute in Tidewater, Va., when he was summoned by his commanding
officer in January 1944.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got orders to go to Great Lakes, and I think you will not
be sorry," said Cmdr. E. Hall Downes, whom Cooper had come to
consider a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at the Illinois naval facility, Cooper and 15 other black
sailors were told: "You know why you're here? You are being
considered for officer candidate's school."</TE>
<TE>   One of the 16 thunderstruck men later expressed their collective
reaction: "We looked at each other and thought he had lost his mind."</TE>
<TE>   Such a stunning announcement was the result of pressure from civil
rights groups and a liberal politician's efforts to soothe the
troubled racial waters during World War II. By then, the wartime Navy
had about 100,000 black sailors but no black officers.</TE>
<TE>   Adlai E. Stevenson, the future Illinois governor and presidential
candidate who was serving as assistant secretary of the Navy, won
approval for his proposal to remedy that discrepancy by accelerating
officer commissions for a dozen or so black enlisted men.</TE>
<TE>   The 16 selectees were already proven leaders of enlisted men and,
save one, had college educations. Nevertheless, they underwent
rigorous screening, including background checks by the FBI, that no
white officer's candidate ever faced.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed "Navy 101," their crash training program taught by white
officers telescoped four years of courses in seamanship, navigation,
gunnery, naval regulations and naval law into three months. The men's
combined home and classroom were barracks segregated from white
officer candidates and black enlisted men.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen candidates were chosen for a dozen officer rankings,
historians learned later, because the Navy expected a normal 25%
attrition rate--or that four of the candidates would fail.</TE>
<TE>   None did.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided early in the game that we were going to either sink or
swim together--even to the point of studying together after we were
supposed to be in bed," Cooper told Paul Stillwell, a historian for
the Naval Institute, a private professional society based at the U.S.
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., for his book "The Golden Thirteen:
Recollections of the First Black Naval Officers."</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember being in those barracks and sitting in the head
[bathroom] after lights out," Cooper said, "just drilling each other
back and forth until it hurt because we were convinced that if one of
us made it, we were all going to make it."</TE>
<TE>   But despite the men's 100% pass rate, the Navy remained reluctant
to have too many black officers. So Stevenson's suggested dozen were
made ensigns; a 13th, apparently the man who had never completed a
college degree, became a warrant officer; and the remaining three
were returned to the enlisted ranks.</TE>
<TE>   The "Golden Thirteen"--the number of new black officers with new
gold bars--received their commissions with little fanfare, national
publicity or even a graduation ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the only one of the 13 who could go into the Navy store and
put on a uniform and walk out with it," Cooper said. "Everybody else
had to have it altered. I was the first black man to wear a naval
officer's uniform because my size was just right."</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, over that weekend we had liberty, so I was going to
see my wife, who was in Hamilton, Ohio, getting ready to have our
baby. I walked into the railroad station in Chicago, and that whole
station stood still--literally."</TE>
<TE>   Although commissioned with the war still in progress, the 13 were
all given relatively menial jobs, not allowed to command white troops
and kept away from combat zones. Only one of the men made a career as
a naval officer.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper returned to the Hampton Institute, this time as the
personnel officer at the Naval Training Center. And while the
trainees were both black and white, most of the officers were white
and Cooper encountered the inevitable racism.</TE>
<TE>   "Many [white sailors] simply refused to salute. If they'd see me
coming, they would cross the street and get on the other side."</TE>
<TE>   He said he became agitated only once--when a sailor stopped within
a foot of his face as he was walking with his wife and daughter in
Newport News, Va., and said to him: "You black SOB, I read about you
guys, but I never thought I'd meet one."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said he started to go after the sailor, but was stopped by
his wife, who told him it wasn't worth it. He agreed, calmed himself
and thanked her.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Cooper was ordered to go to the Pacific. He never made
it, however, because of a back injury he received during basic
training at Great Lakes. He received a medical discharge and
continued teaching and assisting veterans at Hampton for a number of
years.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Washington, N.C., Cooper was one of 11 children. His
father, who ran a sheet metal shop, and his homemaker mother barely
completed grade school but lived to see all of their 10 surviving
children get college educations.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper earned a vocational education degree at Hampton Institute,
married and began his teaching career at an Ohio university. But when
war broke out, he returned to Hampton to train Navy metal smiths and
soon enlisted to keep the job.</TE>
<TE>   After his years in the Navy and at Hampton, Cooper moved back to
Ohio in the early 1950s to work as a Dayton housing inspector, and
then as Antioch College's director of its international work-study
program.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, he became the first black person to run a
Dayton city department when he was appointed director of Human
Resources. Until his retirement in the early 1980s, he managed more
than 900 people in seven divisions handling corrections, housing,
health, consumer protection, parks and recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Stillwell, the "Golden Thirteen's" historian and a retired Navy
commander who served in Vietnam, became a close friend of Cooper's
and described him as "a warm and generous man." He said despite
Cooper's failing health, he remained an engaging speaker intent on
improving race relations in western Ohio, where he spent much of his
adult life.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that each of us has an obligation to help those coming
behind and he lived those beliefs till the end," Stillwell said.</TE>
<TE>   With the death of Cooper, only three of the "Golden Thirteen"
survive. There are, however, now more than 3,000 black officers in
the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper is survived by his wife, Margaret of Centerville, Ohio; a
daughter, Peggy Cooper Davis of New York City; and a granddaughter.</TE>

victim of a homicide, police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Neal Daniel Sheldon of Newport Beach was found Sunday
about 9:30 a.m. in a room at the Countryside Inn, said Costa Mesa
Police Lt. Dale Birney. The 42-year-old victim suffered blunt-force
trauma to the head, Birney said in a news release.</LD>
<LD>   Sheldon checked in to the motel, on Bristol Street near Red Hill
Avenue, five days before his body was discovered, Birney said. It was
the first homicide in Costa Mesa this year.</LD>

<HD>Ventura County Farm Prices Grow</HD>
<DH>Economy: Region's strawberry acreage is now the sixth most
valuable cropland in the state. But tenants and newcomers face higher
costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County farmland is now among the priciest in California,
largely because of strong demand for the fertile soil of the Oxnard
Plain, where growers have established the state's fastest-growing
strawberry industry.</LD>
<LD>   Prime strawberry ground sold for as much as $49,000 an acre last
year, nearly double the top prices recorded in 1994, according to a
survey by the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers.</LD>
<LD>   That makes the county's strawberry acreage the sixth most valuable
farmland in the state--behind the date palm orchards of the Coachella
Valley, dairy land in the Inland Empire and the wine grape regions of
Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the value of most of the county's other cropland also
has increased in recent years, the study showed.</TE>
<TE>   Farming officials say the solid land values reflect in part
Ventura County's agricultural prowess, noting that growers have
flocked to the region because of its ideal growing conditions and the
diversity of its year-round harvests.</TE>
<TE>   And as long as farm income holds steady, officials say such values
should bode well for the future of agriculture as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "It means we are going to be able to continue farming for quite a
while," said Earl McPhail, the county's agricultural commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we sit here on a part of the coast that allows us to
do a lot of things that other places can't do, so that makes our
farmland attractive," he added. "There is only so much ground to go
around, and our ground is valuable because of what we can grow here."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not all good news on the farmland front.</TE>
<TE>   While landowners have benefited from a boost in values, the high
price of Ventura County farmland has made it hard for
newcomers--particularly small farmers--to break into the business.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the higher values in many cases have translated into
higher rents, making it increasingly difficult for tenant farmers to
make a profit in an industry wracked by rising production costs and
global competition.</TE>
<TE>   Farmland values are up nearly across the board in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Lemon groves were selling for up to $25,000 an acre five years
ago. They are now fetching as much as $34,500 an acre, according to
the survey compiled by the California chapter of the farmland
appraisal group.</TE>
<TE>   During that same period, avocado acreage went from up to $25,000
an acre in 1997 to a high of $28,000 an acre last year.</TE>
<TE>   Those values were among the highest for any cropland in the state,
the survey said.</TE>
<TE>   Only the county's orange industry, which is in a decades-long
decline, has lost ground during the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   Orange groves were selling for $15,000 an acre in 1997 compared
with $14,000 last year. Meanwhile, high-end land values have dropped
by half since 1994, when orange groves were selling for as much as
$28,000 an acre.</TE>
<TE>   The plummeting values reflect a series of setbacks for orange
growers.</TE>
<TE>   Although still a strong component of Ventura County's farm
economy, the crop has experienced significant losses in recent years,
prompting growers to uproot thousands of trees in favor of lemons,
avocados and other produce better able to turn a profit in
California's increasingly competitive fruit and vegetable markets.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Farm Bureau President Edgar Terry, a
fourth-generation vegetable farmer, said land values have held strong
over the years in part because growers have been able to make the
transition from money-losing crops to higher-value ones such as
strawberries, nursery stock and cut flowers.</TE>
<TE>   There are also other reasons for the increases, Terry said.</TE>
<TE>   With its ideal soil and climate and plentiful water supply,
Ventura County is a desirable place to farm, Terry said.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that the range of crops that can be grown
locally--everything from asparagus to zucchini--and the county's
year-round growing season, and the land becomes even more attractive.</TE>
<TE>   But he said perhaps the biggest reason that farmland is at such a
premium is the migration of growers to Ventura Country from areas
such as Orange County, where much of the farmland has been plowed
under to make way for development.</TE>
<TE>   "It basically becomes the law of supply and demand," said Terry,
who along with his brother farms about 600 acres countywide. "There
is a finite amount of ground [in Ventura County] and the competition
for that ground is escalating."</TE>
<TE>   The same holds true in other parts of the state, according to the
farmland study.</TE>
<TE>   In grape-rich Napa County, the value of high-end vineyard land has
more than tripled over the last five years, selling last year for as
much as $180,000 an acre.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the price of dairy land in Riverside and San Bernardino
counties--about $100,000 an acre on the high end--nearly doubled from
1997 to 2001, while the price of Coachella Valley date orchards has
shot up 40%, to a high of $50,000 an acre, during that same period.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Clarke, a Santa Maria-based farmland investment manager who
helped present the survey at a conference last month, said the values
in the study reflect actual sales prices recorded last year.</TE>
<TE>   And ranges are presented in each farmland category, so that
growers and others will know, for example, that the price of Napa
Valley vineyards ranged from a low of $85,000 an acre to a high of
$180,000 an acre in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke said it is impossible to draw any generalizations about
farmland values statewide, because growing conditions and other
factors vary from region to region.</TE>
<TE>   But in Ventura County, as well as the rest of the coastal farming
region that stretches north to Monterey County, Clarke said the trend
over the years has been toward strong if not increasing land values.</TE>
<TE>   And that points, to some extent, to the strength and diversity of
the agricultural industry in the region, he said.</TE>

<LD>The Ventura County Board of Supervisors meetings are going global.</LD>
<LD>   Starting next week, anyone with an Internet connection can watch
the five politicians hash out county policy, set sewer rates and,
occasionally, trade insults.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County joins only a handful of local governments in
California that have put live sessions on the Internet, said Matt
Carroll, the county's chief information officer.</LD>
<TE>   The county may be particularly well-suited for the technology
because it ranks No. 1 in the state for homes with high-speed
Internet connections, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   The board's weekly Tuesday meeting, which begins at 8:30 a.m.,
will be relayed live with sound and pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we should call it 'Tuesday Morning Live!'" Chief Deputy
Executive Officer Bert Bigler said, joking.</TE>
<TE>   A copy of each meeting will be available on the county's Web page
for three months. That way, someone who wants information on a
particular issue can download previous meetings to see what happened,
Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Meetings will also be available to the public on compact disc.</TE>
<TE>   To find the link to live board meetings, go to the Web page, at
www.countyofventura.org.</TE>
<TE>   The public's first chance to check out a live meeting will be June
4.</TE>

<HD>For Some Grads, It's Back to School or Get a McJob</HD>
<DH>Working: They are increasingly desperate as the economic
downturn, high-tech cutbacks and Sept. 11 produce the weakest market
in years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As weeks of joblessness stretch into months, many recent college
graduates say they are getting more desperate each day.</LD>
<LD>   Some have turned to any employment they can find. Norm McClave,
28, who graduated from Princeton before receiving his MBA from
Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, is a contract employee
at 20th Century Fox.</LD>
<LD>   Others are giving up--at least temporarily--to boost their resumes
with more schooling, such as classical civilization major Marisol
Aguilar, 22, who is staying at UCLA another year.</LD>
<TE>   Others press on, sending out dozens of resumes and waiting for
callbacks that are few and far between.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Hefler has sent out 40 resumes and gone to three
interviews since graduating in December from USC with a biochemistry
degree. As cartoons blared on television in his Los Angeles
apartment, he said he wished he had spent some of his college life
taking on an internship or lab work.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seemed retarded to work and not get paid when I was in
school, but now I'd kill for two years' experience," said Hefler, 23.
"The chance of getting callbacks is abysmal when you're just one of a
couple thousand resumes and you have no experience. Right now I think
I'd do pretty much about anything."</TE>
<TE>   Hefler and thousands of other highly educated job seekers in
California are facing what most college career counselors and labor
market experts agree is one of the most competitive job markets since
the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The job market is especially parched in California, with employers
in the West saying they planned to hire 63.5% fewer new college grads
than in 2001, according to a survey conducted by the National Assn.
of Colleges and Employers. Nationwide, employers estimated a 36.4%
drop in hiring.</TE>
<TE>   "Applicants seem to be much more desperate to get any kind of
paycheck," said Allstate Insurance spokeswoman Lisa Wannamaker, who
added that the company plans to hire about as many people as in past
years but that the applicant pool is much more qualified. University
officials said many graduates are settling for lesser positions,
unlike in recent years when they had their pick among multiple job
offers.</TE>
<TE>   "The slowing down of the economy means the slowing down of
opportunities," said Linda Baldwin, admissions director at UCLA's
Anderson School of Business. "Students are being forced to give up
their pipe dreams and look for shelter somewhere, whether it's in
grad school or prolonging their undergraduate time, or in taking a
job that isn't the one of their dreams."</TE>
<TE>   The lagging economy, a downturn in the high-tech and consulting
industries, and the aftershocks of Sept. 11 are causing the bleak
outlook, experts said. .</TE>
<TE>   "We're coming out of a period in the late '90s where anyone with
half a brain could get a decent job," said labor economist Alec
Levenson, a USC Marshall School of Business professor. "And decent
meaning not just relatively well-paying, but one that actually
matched their real desires and interests.... Those golden days are
over."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford economics graduate Sam Wordie is one of many using law
school or other graduate programs as a refuge from the economic
downturn. Law school applications had risen 18.5% nationwide by
mid-May, the biggest annual increase in 20 years, according to the
nonprofit Law School Admissions Council.</TE>
<TE>   Wordie, 22, a varsity football player who had two internships
before graduating last year, has been substitute teaching and waiting
tables in East Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got into law school and didn't get a job after graduating,
it sort of made my choice for me," said Wordie, who will attend New
York University. "A college degree just doesn't carry as much weight
as it used to."</TE>
<TE>   Humanitarian outreach programs, such as AmeriCorps, are also
seeing a surge of interest. Teach for America, an organization that
places recent graduates in classrooms in low-income neighborhoods
across the country, received about 14,000 applications this year,
nearly triple the number it received in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Students are being more introspective about the kinds of things
they want to do," said Alysa Polkes, Career Management Center
director at UCLA's business school. "It's a lot easier to go in that
direction when there aren't a whole lot of other opportunities vying
for their attention."</TE>
<TE>   McClave, the MBA holder who's working at Fox, said that at least
the undemanding job allows him to continue his job search. He added,
however, that he has lowered his expectations substantially since he
moved to Los Angeles after graduating a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Godehn, who started an improv troupe at Whittier College and
acted in more than 20 plays, graduated from the college Friday with a
theater degree and began a job as a waitress Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely frustrating, especially when I consider how much
money I put into this school," said Godehn, 22, who will make minimum
wage plus tips. "I assume it will pay itself back in the future. But
for now, being a college graduate waiting tables makes me feel like a
fish out of water."</TE>
<TE>   But while other graduates return to the classroom or scramble for
whatever paycheck they can get, some are gearing up to start their
dream jobs. Josh Seno snagged a job generating new business at a San
Diego pharmaceutical company after graduating this year with a
master's degree in bioscience from the Claremont University
Consortium's Keck Graduate Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The 25-year-old's position will require his technical knowledge
and the business acumen he gained while getting his degree, which
combines elements of an MBA with a focus on science.</TE>
<TE>   Getting those kinds of skills during the current financial slump
is key to finding employment in one's field, said Baldwin of UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "Next year, as the economy heats up, students will have more
choices," she said. "Students are just trying to find refuge right
now, but it's those who use this year constructively who will get the
unique tools that will set them apart."</TE>

<LD>Smack in the middle of various busy suburbs is an exit of the Orange
Freeway that is frozen in time.</LD>
<LD>   The offramp to Tonner Canyon Road in Brea doesn't lead to a busy
thoroughfare with stoplights, gridlocked commuters and crowded gas
stations. The road has remained a quiet driveway into the wilderness
and oil fields of north Orange County, just as it was when it was
built three decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   There is so little traffic that wildlife displaced by the
surrounding suburban sprawl has moved in. Mountain lions, bobcats,
coyotes and other critters move under the freeway at the intersection
every day as they travel a 31-mile wildlife corridor that stretches
from the Cleveland National Forest to the Whittier Narrows area.</LD>
<TE>   Local officials and environmentalists fear that would all change
under the county's highway plan, which calls for turning Tonner
Canyon Road into a busy arterial highway that would cut through
untouched wilderness. They say it will flood the area with
through-traffic and invite too much development. Pressure to at least
enlarge and modernize the exit is increasing as oil companies move
forward with plans to build more than 3,500 houses bordering it.</TE>
<TE>   Nuevo Energy Co., which wants to build 914 of those houses, comes
armed with studies showing that building out the interchange would
enhance wildlife movement.</TE>
<TE>   It's an argument many in Brea don't accept.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the few areas that is virtually pristine," said
Glenn Parker, a former city councilman and member of the Wildlife
Corridor Conservation Authority, a regional agency of local and state
officials. "They are under the delusion that this could help
facilitate wildlife movement.... You don't have to be a biologist to
understand the absurdity of that."</TE>
<TE>   Nuevo, however, is not the city's biggest obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for Brea is a collection of cities to the east
desperately looking for solutions to the traffic created by commuters
trying to make their way to and from the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed road would be part of a plan to ease congestion in
Four Corners, where the borders of four counties converge. A recent
regional transportation study predicted that traffic would double in
the area by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Brea's petition to remove Tonner Canyon from the traffic plan is
now in the hands of the Orange County Transportation Authority.
County officials say they are withholding comment until the studies
have been analyzed.</TE>
<TE>   But objections are surfacing. Diamond Bar officials sent a letter
to Brea and county planners reminding the city that it is part of a
coalition working to reach consensus on Four Corners traffic issues.</TE>

<HD>Brea Fights Road Buildup That Energy Firm Calls Aid to
Wildlife</HD>
<DH>Transportation: The county, cities to the east and builder
press for expansion of quiet Tonner Canyon Road. Brea officials don't
see the need.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Smack in the middle of various busy suburbs is an exit of the Orange
Freeway that is frozen in time.</LD>
<LD>   The offramp to Tonner Canyon Road in Brea doesn't lead to a busy
thoroughfare with stoplights, gridlocked commuters and crowded gas
stations, like so many other freeway offramps. The road has remained
a quiet driveway into the wilderness and oil fields of north Orange
County, just as it was when it was built three decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   There is so little traffic that wildlife displaced by the
surrounding suburban sprawl has moved in. Mountain lions, bobcats,
coyotes and other critters move under the freeway at the intersection
every day as they travel from one side to the other of a 31-mile
wildlife corridor that stretches from the Cleveland National Forest
to the Whittier Narrows area.</LD>
<TE>   Local officials and environmentalists fear that would all change
under the county's highway plan, which calls for turning Tonner
Canyon Road into a busy arterial highway that would cut through
untouched wilderness. They say it will flood the area with
through-traffic and invite too much new development. Pressure to at
least enlarge and modernize the exit is increasing as oil companies
move forward with plans to build more than 3,500 houses on properties
bordering it.</TE>
<TE>   Nuevo Energy Co., which wants to build 914 of those houses, comes
armed with studies showing that building out the interchange,
complete with a small connecting access road and special bridges to
allow animals extra room to maneuver, would actually enhance wildlife
movement.</TE>
<TE>   It's an argument many in Brea don't accept.</TE>
<TE>   They believe that once a full-service interchange is put in,
pressure to get the highway built through Tonner Canyon will mount.
"This is one of the few areas that is virtually pristine," said Glenn
Parker, a former city councilman and member of the Wildlife Corridor
Conservation Authority, a regional agency made up of local and state
officials. "They are under the delusion that this could help
facilitate wildlife movement.... You don't have to be a biologist to
understand the absurdity of that."</TE>
<TE>   Nuevo, however, is not the city's biggest obstacle in its bid to
get the Tonner Canyon make-over taken off the county highway plan.
Company officials say they can be flexible--even as they warn that
other solutions would clog other local roads.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for Brea is a collection of cities to the east
desperately looking for solutions to the traffic created by commuters
trying to make their way to and from the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed road would be part of a plan to ease congestion in
what is known as Four Corners, where the borders of four counties
converge. It is a major gateway into job-rich Orange County for
commuters in rapidly growing bedroom communities to the east. A
recent regional transportation study predicted that traffic would
double in the area by 2020, slowing rush hour speeds to 10 mph on
some freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Brea's petition to remove Tonner Canyon from the traffic plan is
now in the hands of the Orange County Transportation Authority, which
will have an advisory committee review it once several traffic
studies have been completed. County transportation and planning
officials say they are withholding comment on the petition until
after the studies have been completed and analyzed.</TE>
<TE>   But objections from others are already surfacing. Diamond Bar
officials sent a letter to Brea and county planners reminding the
city that it is part of a coalition that is supposed to be working to
reach consensus on Four Corners traffic issues.</TE>
<TE>   The letter implored the city not to undermine the efforts of that
coalition and noted that a road through Tonner Canyon had been on the
county traffic plan for years.</TE>
<TE>   Brea officials say that means only that the road plan is dated.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have changed over the years," said Charlie View,
development services director for the city.</TE>
<TE>   He points out that the path of growth in Brea was changed by the
expansion of a landfill in the hills near the freeway, the wildlife
corridor being designated, and the city imposing measures to protect
its ridgelines from development.</TE>
<TE>   "We no longer see a need for a large arterial road on the top of
that canyon," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-O.C. Priest Is Removed</HD>
<DH>Church: He leaves an Oregon parish after he tells superiors
of 1980s 'indiscretions.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest who was permitted to continue working at a
Huntington Beach church in the mid-1990s despite a molestation
settlement from an earlier post has been removed from his parish in
Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   Father Gus Krumm, a 48-year-old Franciscan priest, was dismissed
as pastor at Ascension Catholic Church in Portland last week after
informing church officials of "indiscretions which occurred in the
early '70s and mid-'80s," according to a statement by the Franciscan
Friars of California.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, the Franciscan Friars paid an undisclosed amount to a
former student at St. Anthony's Seminary in Santa Barbara who alleged
Krumm repeatedly molested him there during the early 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement occurred after Krumm had been working for seven
years as an associate pastor at Saints Simon &amp; Jude Catholic Church
in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The Diocese of Orange was informed of the settlement but declined
to remove Krumm from his post.</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan spokeswoman Maria Schinderle said the allegations were
investigated at the time and found not to merit a dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   The Franciscan Order reiterated that in a statement Monday:</TE>
<TE>   "This allegation was investigated twice and proven to be
unsubstantiated."</TE>
<TE>   Krumm left the Huntington Beach church in 1998 to become pastor at
the Portland parish. Church officials in Oregon were informed of the
allegations against Krumm at that time.</TE>
<TE>   Another former seminary student at Santa Barbara recently made
molestation allegations against Krumm from the same period,
Franciscan officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Franciscan Order did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Their statement does not indicate how Krumm confessed his
"indiscretions" to church superiors, or what those indiscretions
were.</TE>
<TE>   It says only that they "had never been revealed before" Krumm
disclosed them last Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how they were discovered," said Mary Jo Tully,
chancellor for the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us there was the possibility of new allegations, and he
was removed."</TE>

<HD>Citizen Soldiers Flock to Site of Budget Battle</HD>
<DH>Protest: The poor, the elderly, firefighters and police,
along with others affected by possible cuts, are rallying in
Sacramento.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Manuel Romero has neither pricey suits nor personal
relationships with the Capitol's in crowd, but in his own way he is
trying his best these days to act like a lobbyist.</LD>
<LD>   The Hollywood security guard and about 4,000 church counterparts
showed up in Sacramento last week to protest Gov. Gray Davis' plan to
slash spending on health care and other services to balance the
state's next budget, saying the cuts would fall too heavily on the
poor.</LD>
<LD>   With Davis trying to close a projected $23.6-billion budget hole
this summer, rallies are springing up around the Capitol as the
elderly, firefighters, police officers and housing advocates seek to
protect their piece of the pie.</LD>
<TE>   In the process, Californians such as Romero, who belongs to a
coalition of faith-based groups that have lobbied to expand health
care for the uninsured, are putting a human face on what can be an
arcane document: the state's $100-billion budget.</TE>
<TE>   By making the trip to Sacramento, the demonstrators are exceeding
traditional displays of political participation, such as voting or
making a campaign contribution. Their public pleas for funding also
stand in contrast to traditional lobbying, much of which occurs
behind closed doors or at private parties that feature food, booze
and the occasional ice sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, a
group that lobbies on behalf of the poor during the budget process,
said the number of ordinary Californians who showed up last week
marked a substantial difference from the protests during California's
last budget crisis a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for people who don't have a pool of lobbyists to
come and weigh in on critical budget issues and provide a voice for
people who don't have one," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   Rallies are helpful, according to Peter Szego, a volunteer
lobbyist for the AARP who previously worked as a chief of staff to a
state senator, but he said lobbying individual lawmakers is what
really pays off. Many groups, in fact, hold a rally and then retreat
inside the Capitol to meet with lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "People who get elected to office automatically tend to react to
what their constituents tell them," Szego said. "Events are
influenced by what we do."</TE>
<TE>   The American Assn. of Retired Persons was one of roughly a dozen
groups that rallied this month to draw attention to seniors issues.
The event drew more than 2,000 Californians to the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Szego said his group, which boasts 3 million members in
California, wants the governor and lawmakers to restore federal and
state cost-of-living increases for certain disabled Californians.</TE>
<TE>   Other issues that have prompted Capitol rallies this spring
include preserving a program to hire new police officers and
expanding a health insurance program so that it covers 300,000
parents of poor children, rather than only the children.</TE>
<TE>   Romero, who is married with two children, said his family must
wait in long lines at a hospital when ill because he can't afford
insurance. He wants state officials to expand health coverage to the
working poor so that he and his family can get insurance. "I don't
feel comfortable," he said of his maiden "lobbying" journey to
Sacramento. "I feel angry. It's more difficult for the uninsured."</TE>
<TE>   Romero belongs to the Pacific Institute for Community
Organization, a coalition of faith-based groups that has lobbied to
expand health care to the poor. An estimated 4,000 members showed up
in Sacramento last week for a rally, which garnered an appearance by
Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), and to present state
officials with copies of their "Fair Share Budget Plan."</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, members would agree to pay higher vehicle license
fees, but also want corporations and wealthy Californians to pay
higher taxes to help avoid deep cuts to health care and social
services.</TE>
<TE>   Davis proposed the cuts in the revised budget he released earlier
this month. Lawmakers will incorporate the governor's proposals into
a compromise plan that requires a two-thirds approval of the
Legislature. Until the budget is approved, individuals with a stake
will continue trying to sway Davis and lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We receive all forms of communication," said Matt Back, chief of
staff for Assemblyman John Campbell, the Irvine Republican who
handles budget matters for his caucus. Back estimated that over a
two-day period his office received more than 100 faxes from groups
hoping to restore proposed budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   They include one from the executive director of the Pasadena
Conservatory of Music about a "devastating and crippling 57% cut" in
funding for the California Arts Council. Another comes from a Long
Beach doctor who asked Campbell to reject attempts to cut
reimbursements paid to physicians who participate in the Medi-Cal
program.</TE>
<TE>   "The more contact we get from groups the more influence they have,
but there is certainly no guarantees," Back said.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, the Long Beach Democrat who chairs
the Assembly Budget Committee, described the rallies and office
visits by constituents as "very, very valuable."</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to look at all of these recommendations on a piece of
paper and lose touch that we're talking about real human beings,"
Oropeza said. That fact was not lost on the several hundred police
officers, firefighters, sheriff's deputies and officials from city
and county governments from around the state who converged on the
Capitol recently to ask state officials to balance the state's budget
without cutting money to local governments.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' revised budget would cut or delay funding that aids
libraries, buys high-technology equipment for peace officers and
helps cities pay counties for booking people into county jails.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for women, meanwhile, held a news conference at the
Capitol last week to release a report on the number of California
women--more than one in three single women and their dependent
children--living in poverty. Patti Chang, president of the Women's
Foundation, warned that officials would be balancing the budget at
women's expense by cutting programs to help women become financially
secure.</TE>
<TE>   The abundance of news conferences and rallies raises the question
of whether any are reaching policymakers. Shane Goldsmith, an
organizer for the National Campaign for Jobs &amp; Income Support, said
many groups support one another's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just here to echo that message one more time," Goldsmith
said last week as she stood in a downpour waiting for her group's
"Save the Safety Net for Children and Families" rally to begin
outside the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Alas for Goldsmith, the event was canceled after word spread of a
tornado warning.</TE>

<DH>Accidents: Three girls die when truck plunges into a canal;

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three teenage girls were killed Monday when the pickup truck in which
they were riding went off a highway in Corona and plunged 84 feet
into a canal, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Lauren Nicole Campbell, 17, of Alta Loma apparently lost control
of the truck about 7 a.m. on Interstate 15 near Temescal Creek Wash
in Riverside County.</LD>
<LD>   The truck drifted onto a dirt embankment, smashed through a
chain-link fence and plunged into the waterway, which is a local
flood-control channel, a CHP spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   There are no indications that Campbell was under the influence of
drugs or alcohol and the investigation is continuing, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly Anne Phillips, 18, of Etiwanda and Rachel Dorado, 17, of
Alta Loma were also killed in the accident, according to the
Riverside County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary statewide count of traffic fatalities over the
Memorial Day weekend was somewhat lower than last year's.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, 20 people were killed in highway crashes from 6 p.m.
Friday to 6 a.m. Monday, compared with 33 deaths during the same
period in 2001, CHP spokesman Luis Mendoza said. Statistics for the
entire weekend have not yet been compiled.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, a Marine from Camp Pendleton died after crashing
his motorcyle into a wall Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Joshua Gruka, 20, of New York was speeding near the
borders of Orange and Riverside counties about 2:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said he was riding his motorcycle at more than 100mph
around the dangerous twists of the Ortega Highway.</TE>
<TE>   "He went head-on into a wall," said California Highway Patrol
Officer Katrina Lundgren. Gruka died of massive injuries at the
scene, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the overall highway death rate was lower than last year,
the CHP emphasized that the holiday is much worse than a normal
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more than a 50% increase in serious accidents and drunk
driving arrests over your average weekend," Mendoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state, 1,364 motorists were arrested for driving under
the influence of drugs or alcohol in the first 60 holiday hours,
compared with 1,214 arrests last year.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officers made 276 DUI arrests in Los Angeles County during the
first 60 hours of the holiday weekend, compared with 250 arrests last
year.</TE>
<TE>   With many travelers returning home Monday, spokesmen for area
airports and Amtrak trains reported no major delays or incidents
Monday.</TE>

<HD>Detained Students Return to U.S.</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Two men expelled from a UC program for taking part
in the siege at the Church of the Nativity plan to go back to Egypt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two University of California students who spent eight days in
Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity during the recent siege were
released from an Israeli prison Sunday and flew immediately to the
U.S., according to their parents.</LD>
<LD>   Robert O'Neill, 21, a UC Berkeley student from Claremont, and
Nauman Zaidi, 26, a UC Riverside undergraduate from Rancho Cucamonga,
boarded a flight with tickets bought by their parents just before
midnight Sunday in Tel Aviv and arrived at Newark International
Airport in New Jersey at 4:45 a.m. Monday, according to family
members.</LD>
<LD>   They had spent more than two weeks in custody in Israel after the
siege ended.</LD>
<TE>   "We were very, very happy to hear from him," said O'Neill's
mother, Merrilyn, who received an early morning call from her son.
"He sounded tired, but his voice was much more relaxed than I had
heard it in weeks."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill planned to spend a day and a half with his fiancee and her
family in Springfield, Mass., before he and Zaidi return to Egypt to
finish their studies at the American University of Cairo as
independent students. They were dropped from UC's overseas program in
Cairo for putting themselves in danger, a violation of the
university's rules.</TE>
<TE>   Nasim Zaidi got a similar phone call Monday from his son, who told
his father he was shopping for a plane ticket back to Cairo. "That's
fine with me," said the senior Zaidi. "As long as he's out of jail."</TE>
<TE>   Zaidi, a student of religion and toxicology, and O'Neill, who is
studying cultural anthropology and the Middle East, had spent the
academic year in Cairo under the UC program. The men, who got to know
each other in Cairo, were spending spring break doing relief work.</TE>
<TE>   According to Merrilyn O'Neill, when they found out that the
pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement was trying to get
food to people in the church, the two men decided to help. The church
was under siege by Israeli troops, who said terrorists were hiding
inside, until May 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Californians and three other Americans were detained by
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether the two UC students were deported. Although
family members believe they were, a State Department source said
Monday that it was unknown whether deportation actually occurred. The
State Department source would only say that all five Americans made
arrangements to leave Israel.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill and Zaidi must reenroll at UC but, according to UC
spokesman Michael Reese, that is just a formality.</TE>
<TE>   "They broke some pretty big rules. I understand," said Merrilyn
O'Neill. "They signed a contract saying they won't put themselves or
others in danger, and that's exactly what they did."</TE>
<TE>   But O'Neill added about her son: "I was very proud that he took a
stand. The strength of his convictions amazed me.... Of course, I was
also terrified for him and everyone else in there."</TE>
<TE>   Initially in detention, "they spent a great deal of time playing
chess," O'Neill said. But last week, the two men were moved to a more
solitary area, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Both young men had been resisting deportation efforts because they
wanted to return to Israel. They also resisted their parents' efforts
to buy and send them tickets to the U.S. "They felt we should not be
paying for their deportation," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   But both parents bought tickets. "We wanted him back home so he
can get on with his life," Nasim Zaidi said.</TE>
<TE>   Although no longer in the UC overseas program, Zaidi and O'Neill
plan to return to Cairo to finish their coursework. O'Neill said she
had gotten an e-mail from the American University provost in Cairo
saying that the two would be met at the airport and assisted in
finishing their studies.</TE>
<TE>   "They are truly being greeted with open arms," O'Neill said.</TE>

<HD>Striking Hospital Workers Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Striking health care employees at Queen of Angels-Hollywood
Presbyterian Medical Center ended their planned four-day walkout
Monday but vowed to continue efforts to secure higher wages and other
improvements.</LD>
<LD>   "The workers have shown they are together on this and are not
going to back down," said Blanca Gallegos, spokeswoman for Local 399
of Service Employees International Union, which represents most
hospital staff.</LD>
<LD>   Almost 200 people--employees and supporters--signaled the end of
the strike Monday evening with a boisterous rally and vigil outside
the hospital's emergency room entrance on Vermont Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   Nurses, lab technicians, therapists and other staff launched the
strike Friday in an attempt to put pressure on hospital
administration to increase its wage and benefit offer. The union's
last contract expired May 13, and negotiations between the two sides
broke down a week later.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital management brought in 150 replacement nurses and other
workers to fill the void, said Gregory Monette, a spokesman for the
medical center.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome our workers back, and we look forward to working
together with them," Monette said.</TE>
<TE>   Union representatives said the replacement care led to many
patient complaints at the 434-bed facility. But the hospital
spokesman said operations ran smoothly. The two sides also disagreed
on how many employees are represented by the union.</TE>
<TE>   According to the union, higher wages are needed to make the
facility competitive with other area hospitals and attract and retain
staff members. Pay for registered nurses ranges from $21 to $29 an
hour, compared with $27 to $36 an hour at other hospitals, said
Jeanne Estanislao, who said she has been a nurse at Queen of
Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're losing people all the time," said Estanislao, who charged
that the nurse to patient ratio was excessive and unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital spokesman said wages were competitive with other
similar hospitals. He said the hospital did not skimp on patient
care, despite dealing with a nationwide nursing shortage.</TE>
<TE>   The union rejected the hospital's last contract offer, which
included an 11% raise over two years.</TE>
<TE>   Management was notified of the planned strike in advance. Union
leaders say another walkout is possible if management does not come
up with an improved offer. The workers were not paid for their missed
days but received limited compensation from the union.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital spokesman said management was open to negotiating
anew with the union.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to see a strike; we just responded to it," Monette
said.</TE>

<HD>Schools Should Look to the Past to Prepare Coaches</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the school year draws to a close, it's an appropriate time to
address the issue of how to prepare young coaches to assume control
of a sports program.</LD>
<LD>   The old way of choosing a coach, based solely on their experiences
as a player, doesn't work. The so-called players' coach wouldn't last
a month in an environment that requires specific understanding of
issues ranging from devising a budget to ordering equipment, from
fund-raising to dealing with one-on-one parent meetings.</LD>
<LD>   But that hasn't prevented some schools from hiring unprepared
coaches and "throwing them to the wolves," as one coach put it.</LD>
<TE>   There's a better way, and that's turning to retired coaches to
serve as mentors.</TE>
<TE>   School districts have mentor programs for young teachers, in which
they are observed and trained by master teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The same idea can work with coaches. There's an endless reserve of
mature, knowledgeable retired coaches who'd be willing to help if
asked. Their wisdom is sorely needed.</TE>
<TE>   Too many young coaches worry more about their on-field record than
preparing their students for life after high school. Too many young
coaches don't know how to deal with parental bickering. Too many
young coaches don't know what to do when they hear profanity.</TE>
<TE>   Too many young coaches don't know how to act when they object to
an official's call. Too many young coaches don't understand the
importance of maintaining their composure when everyone else is
losing theirs.</TE>
<TE>   A mentoring program for young coaches would be a valuable
educational tool to supplement their experiences as players.</TE>
<TE>   Old coaches don't fade away and disappear. They keep going to
sporting events as spectators, waiting and wishing someone would call
for advice. It's time to make the call.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 football players participated in the Ventura County
combine Wednesday at Oxnard Rio Mesa High. The fastest 40-yard time
was turned in by Westlake running back Kenneth Mackins, the Marmonte
League 100-meter champion. He ran 4.36 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Two intriguing players at the combine were from Thousand Oaks,
6-foot-4, 195-pound receiver Corey Mazza and 6-1 quarterback Brad
Sievert. They're taking over for Colorado State-bound receiver Dave
Anderson and Brigham Young-bound quarterback Ben Olson.</TE>
<TE>   Mazza runs 40 yards in 4.55 seconds, can dunk a basketball and
would crash through a window to catch a football. Sievert was 8-0 as
a starting quarterback for the freshman team and 10-0 as the starting
quarterback for the sophomore team.</TE>
<TE>   It's understandable that not many people know about Sievert. "I
was stuck behind the best quarterback in the country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mazza and Sievert should earn plenty of respect this summer in
passing leagues.</TE>

<TE>   Brett Simpson, a junior at Huntington Beach, won the open men's
division at the National Scholastic Surfing Assn. Western
championships at Huntington Beach Pier two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   He'll be one of the favorites to win the national championship
June 25-29 at Lower Trestles in San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Many scouts are hoping that La Puente Bishop Amat (26-2) and
Westminster La Quinta (28-2) meet for the Southern Section Division
IV baseball championship Saturday at Edison Field so they can see
Adam Simon face Ian Kennedy in a prolific pitching matchup.</TE>
<TE>   But West Hills Chaminade (23-7) has USC-bound left-hander Bobby
Paschal (9-2) ready to face Bishop Amat in today's 3:15 p.m.
semifinal at Lake Balboa Birmingham. Paschal lost to Simon in last
year's semifinal and wants revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Paschal has six shutouts and is in peak form. Bishop Amat will use
Anthony Hidalgo (6-0).</TE>
<TE>   In the other semifinal, unsung Oak Park (22-4) will play host to
La Quinta and go with unshakeable sophomore Garrett Ozar (11-2).</TE>

<TE>   Encino Crespi is starting a football hall of fame by inducting its
first three players at a dinner Saturday night in the school

running back Russell White, who led Crespi to the Division I
championship in 1986.</TE>

<TE>   UCLA-bound Matt Moore of Newhall Hart will quarterback the West
team in Sunday's Valley Youth Conference all-star football game at 5
p.m. at Birmingham High. Moore is also scheduled to play in the
Shrine All-Star Classic on July 13.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County all-star football game is set for June 9 at
Moorpark High.</TE>

<TE>   It's always fun to see how athletic teenage television actors can
be in real life considering they have such little time to play for
sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   On a Saturday afternoon, Frankie Muniz, 16-year-old star of
"Malcolm in the Middle," was playing a one-on-one basketball game
against another teenager at a park in the San Fernando Valley. A
couple kids stopped to watch, but there were no cameras, no
bodyguards, no limousine driver and no one seeking autographs.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a headband, T-shirt and shorts, Muniz was dribbling
between his legs, hitting jump shots and looking like a potential
point guard for a high school team.</TE>
<TE>   He lost by one basket and walked home, his pride intact.</TE>

<HD>Farmland Prices Soar, but Soil Is Becoming Too Rich for
Some</HD>
<DH>Economy: Value of some Ventura County strawberry fields
doubles in seven years. For tenant farmers, it means higher rents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County farmland is now among the priciest in California,
largely because of strong demand for the fertile soil of the Oxnard
Plain, where growers have established the state's fastest-growing
strawberry industry.</LD>
<LD>   Prime strawberry ground sold for as much as $49,000 an acre last
year, nearly double the top prices recorded in 1994, according to a
survey by the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers.</LD>
<LD>   That makes the county's strawberry acreage the sixth-most valuable
farmland in the state--behind the date palm orchards of the Coachella
Valley, dairy land in the Inland Empire and the wine grape regions of
Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the value of most of the county's other cropland also
has increased in recent years, the study showed.</TE>
<TE>   Farming officials say the solid land values reflect in part
Ventura County's agricultural prowess, noting that growers have
flocked to the region because of its ideal growing conditions and the
diversity of its year-round harvests.</TE>
<TE>   And as long as farm income holds steady, officials say such values
should bode well for the future of agriculture as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "It means we are going to be able to continue farming for quite a
while," said Earl McPhail, the county's agricultural commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we sit here on a part of the coast that allows us to
do a lot of things that other places can't do, so that makes our
farmland attractive," he added. "There is only so much ground to go
around, and our ground is valuable because of what we can grow here."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not all good news on the farmland front.</TE>
<TE>   While landowners have benefited from a boost in values, the high
price of Ventura County farmland has made it hard for
newcomers--particularly small farmers--to break into the business.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the higher values in many cases have translated into
higher rents, making it increasingly difficult for tenant farmers to
make a profit in an industry wracked by rising production costs and
global competition.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard strawberry grower Humberto Candelario has seen both the
benefits and drawbacks.</TE>
<TE>   After years of working the fields for others, the 47-year-old
farmer broke into the business in 1990 by leasing 35 acres of prime
strawberry ground for from $600 to $800 an acre. A few years later,
he teamed with others to purchase about 100 acres near Ventura for
about $12,000 an acre.</TE>
<TE>   He now leases about 200 acres, paying rent of more than $2,000 an
acre. At the same time, the 100 acres he owns is now worth $35,000 to
$40,000 an acre.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good and bad," Candelario said about the county's rising
farmland values.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, there is less ground available and more demand to
farm," he said. "It's good for the owners; they make more money. But
for the farmers who are renting, sooner or later they are going to
get to the point where they can't afford to pay for the land."</TE>
<TE>   Farmland values are up nearly across the board in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Lemon groves were selling for up to $25,000 an acre five years
ago. They are now fetching as much as $34,500 an acre, according to
the survey compiled by the California chapter of the farmland
appraisal group.</TE>
<TE>   During that same period, avocado acreage went from up to $25,000
an acre in 1997 to a high of $28,000 an acre last year.</TE>
<TE>   Those values were among the highest for any cropland in the state,
the survey said.</TE>
<TE>   Only the county's orange industry, which is in a decades-long
decline, has lost ground during the past five years.</TE>
<TE>   Orange groves were selling for $15,000 an acre in 1997 compared
with $14,000 last year. Meanwhile, high-end land values have dropped
by half since 1994, when orange groves were selling for as much as
$28,000 an acre.</TE>
<TE>   The plummeting values reflect a series of setbacks for orange
growers.</TE>
<TE>   Although still a strong component of Ventura County's farm
economy, the crop has experienced significant losses in recent years,
prompting growers to uproot thousands of trees in favor of lemons,
avocados and other produce better able to turn a profit in
California's increasingly competitive fruit and vegetable markets.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Farm Bureau President Edgar Terry, a
fourth-generation vegetable farmer, said land values have held strong
over the years in part because growers have been able to make the
transition from money-losing crops to higher-value ones such as
strawberries, nursery stock and cut flowers.</TE>
<TE>   For example, strawberry growers on the Oxnard plain have 8,582
acres in production this year, a 10% increase over last year and
double the acreage dedicated to strawberry production just a decade
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't transition [to higher-value crops], you are out of
business," said Terry, who is currently growing bell peppers on 150
acres near Piru that a short time ago supported orange trees. "And
higher-value crops are naturally going to increase farmland values."</TE>
<TE>   There are also other reasons for the increases, Terry said.</TE>
<TE>   With its ideal soil and climate and plentiful water supply,
Ventura County is a desirable place to farm, Terry said. Add to that
the range of crops that can be grown locally--everything from
asparagus to zucchini--and the county's year-round growing season,
and the land becomes even more attractive.</TE>
<TE>   Terry said farmland values also have benefited from the upward
surge in Ventura County's overall real estate market, which in recent
years has seen rents and housing prices skyrocket to record levels.</TE>
<TE>   But he said perhaps the biggest reason that farmland is at such a
premium is the migration of growers to Ventura Country from areas
such as Orange County, where much of the farmland has been plowed
under to make way for development.</TE>
<TE>   "It basically becomes the law of supply and demand," said Terry,
who along with his brother farms about 600 acres countywide. "There
is a finite amount of ground [in Ventura County] and the competition
for that ground is escalating."</TE>
<TE>   The same holds true in other parts of the state, according to the
farmland study.</TE>
<TE>   In grape-rich Napa County, the value of high-end vineyard land has
more than tripled over the past five years, selling last year for as
much as $180,000 an acre.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the price of dairy land in Riverside and San Bernardino
counties--about $100,000 an acre on the high end--nearly doubled from
1997 to 2001, while the price of Coachella Valley date orchards has
shot up 40%, to a high of $50,000 an acre, during that same period.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Clarke, a Santa Maria-based farmland investment manager who
helped present the survey at a conference last month, said the values
in the study reflect sales prices recorded last year.</TE>
<TE>   And ranges are presented in each farmland category, so that
growers and others will know, for example, that the price of Napa
Valley vineyards ranged from a low of $85,000 an acre to a high of
$180,000 an acre in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke said it is impossible to draw any generalizations about
farmland values statewide, because growing conditions and other
factors vary from region to region.</TE>
<TE>   But in Ventura County, as well as the rest of the coastal farming
region that stretches north to Monterey County, Clarke said the trend
over the years has been toward strong if not increasing land values.
And that points, to some extent, to the strength and diversity of the
agricultural industry in the region, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think five years ago, if I told you the values would be where
they are today, most people in the industry would have said that was
insane," Clarke said. "By and large, I think that means [farmers]
have been successful. If they were not making money, the values would
collapse."</TE>

<HD>Cities Are Turning Over a New Leaf</HD>
<DH>Trees: Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura are gradually removing
decades-old ficus and replacing them with less aggressive species.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fifty years ago, the ficus seemed to be a perfect fit for Ventura
County's coastal communities.</LD>
<LD>   Similar in appearance to a citrus tree, the tall, leafy green
ficus blends nicely with the county's orange and lemon trees. Ficus,
thought to be pest resistant, provided a shaded canopy from the
Southern California sun.</LD>
<LD>   But as these trees matured, the shallow roots of the ficus caused
problems.</LD>
<TE>   Cities found sidewalks buckling and streets cracking as the
aggressive roots of the massive trees made their way above ground.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to protect pedestrians from injuries and themselves
from lawsuits, cities including Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura over
the years launched programs to remove the trees from alongside city
sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a real popular tree, but we just didn't think it through,"
said Bob Westdyke, Camarillo's public works director.</TE>
<TE>   Crews spent the first half of May removing ficus trees and some
diseased pines and magnolias along Arneill Road, between Ponderosa
Drive and Las Posas Road.</TE>
<TE>   Once common in the city, the ficus on Arneill are among the last
to go in Camarillo, Westdyke said.</TE>
<TE>   The final removal project has been divided into three phases
spread over as many years to make the transition easier on the
community.</TE>
<TE>   "We started with the northernmost part of the block first because
that's where the most damage has been done," Westdyke said of the
initial phase, to be completed by mid-August. "If it goes well and
people say that wasn't so bad, we might accelerate the next phase."</TE>
<TE>   Along with planting more than 30 new trees, the $180,000 project
will include a new irrigation system, sidewalks and shrubbery.</TE>
<TE>   Once completed, the street will be lined with a variety of
colorful trees including jacarandas, golden rains and liquidambars.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Manager Larry Davis said the overall community
response has been favorable.</TE>
<TE>   "We know people who live adjacent to Arneill are happy to have the
sunlight back," Davis said. "For so long Arneill has been associated
with the canopy of the ficus trees, but I think it will still be a
very attractive street."</TE>
<TE>   Landscape architect Tom Bostrom, chairman of the Ojai Street and
Park Tree Committee, said he hates to see any tree cut down.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole business of replanting trees is the silver lining,"
Bostrom said. "Trees don't live forever and it's important to have a
strong planting program, especially in urban environments where trees
are constantly challenged."</TE>
<TE>   Knowledge regarding trees in urban areas has advanced tremendously
in the last 40 years, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "You would think street trees in urban settings would be simple,
but it's fairly complicated," Bostrom said. "There are a lot of
built-in conflicts like roads, curbs, sidewalks and underground
utilities."</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, ficus are periodically removed when they encroach on
sidewalks or damage curbs, said David Gorcey, the city's parks
development supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a big tree wanting to survive in a 4-feet-by-4-feet
space," he said. "Ficus trees are very opportunistic and aggressively
push their roots to where they'll survive."</TE>
<TE>   The council discussed ficus trees last week as part of a
consultant's study about trees downtown. Council members indicated
they want to continue replacing ficus where there are problems, such
as in front of retail stores, with more-appropriate choices.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura faced a similar dilemma in 1998. The solution was a plan
that includes removing approximately 750 ficus and olive trees,
although scores of the trees not causing damage to streets and
walkways will remain.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura parks supervisor Daryl Wagar said the program will be
spread out over 10 to 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not only removing trees but planting new ones and catching
up on pruning the 30,000 street trees in Ventura," Wagar said. "We
will be planting about 1,000 new trees over the next five years."</TE>
<TE>   Approximately 100 trees have been planted in the last couple of
months. A wide range of species are being used, including carrot
woods, small magnolias, palms, Chinese elms and soapbarks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really an art and science to selecting proper trees," said
Ojai tree advocate John Christianson. "We can learn from what
happened with the ficus trees that when it's not done properly, the
result is damage to sidewalks and curbs and the ultimate loss of a
tree."</TE>

water-dropping helicopters, battled two brush fires that erupted
Monday afternoon on both sides of the hill below the Griffith
Observatory. The fires, which were contained to less than three
acres, were expected to be doused without any threat to the landmark
observatory or nearby structures, and no one was evacuated, fire
officials said. The lack of strong winds blunted the flames' advance
in the dry brush, officials said. The causes of the fires were under
investigation.</CP>

<HD>Communities Say Keep Out--by Bluffing</HD>
<DH>Housing: Guard shacks, other imposing fixtures can disguise
the fact that streets within are public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The message delivered by the 18-foot-high stone columns and thick
iron gates at the entrance to Simi Valley's Long Canyon development
is clear: Keep moving if you have no business here. Same with the
guard shack at Sea Pine Gate in Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Don't be deceived. The security measures are fake.</LD>
<LD>   The road into Long Canyon's faux Italian villas and French country
mansions is never blocked, because the gates are always swung wide
open. And Sea Pine Gate actually has no guard--or gate.</LD>
<TE>   Functional gates--those that close or lock--come with problems.
They change the status of the thoroughfares within from public to
private, for which upkeep costs can add tens of thousands of dollars
to home prices. Many city officials oppose them. And especially after
Sept. 11, hiring qualified guards to staff them has become a
headache.</TE>
<TE>   Yet "certain personality types still need to have some kind of
gate because of the affluence it implies," said Sandra Kulli,
president of Kulli Marketing in Malibu. "It's an 'I've arrived'
attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Fake gated communities are popping up across California. "There is
a trend toward faux gates," Kulli said. "In a lot of cases people are
finding they like them better than real gates."</TE>
<TE>   It's a suburban variation on the entries to Bel-Air, which have
imposing archways and gatehouses. There are guards to intimidate nosy
outsiders, though the guards have no authority to stop even the least
stylish interloper from driving into the ritzy neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The point of the fakes is to give home buyers the sense of
privacy, security and exclusivity that gates provide, without forcing
developers to deal with the hassles that come with walling off a
community entirely.</TE>
<TE>   Many who want to live in a modern-day fortress find the faux model
just as good as the real thing. Real gates are there to make
homeowners feel special, exclusive and secure. Fakes have the same
effect.</TE>
<TE>   "In the U.S. we are great at buying things we don't need," said
William Fulton, an expert in urban development. "A lot of this stuff
has to do with simply giving home buyers the illusion that they are
safer. But that is all it is, an illusion."</TE>
<TE>   City officials reluctantly accept the fakes, seeing them as at
least an improvement over the real thing, which creates a planning
nightmare by turning cities into fortified enclaves. They blame
locked gates for blocking emergency vehicles and thwarting creation
of bike trail networks, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that several recent studies debunking the theory that gates
make large suburban planned communities safer, and you have even the
most discriminating home buyers questioning whether being in a
closed-off, private development is worth the high cost.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Harbor View in Newport Beach recently remodeled the
unmanned white guard shacks that stand at several entryways to the
community. The shacks imply a private community, but anybody is free
to come and go.</TE>
<TE>   "They provide a sense of identity," said Richard Gollis, a real
estate consultant who lives there.</TE>
<TE>   Planners in the Bay Area city of San Ramon even have a term for
the faux fortresses: "neighborhood entry identities." The term was
coined after the city refused to allow a developer to gate a
community.</TE>
<TE>   The solution was to create what appears to be a private street but
is not. "It was actually designed to look like a gated community,"
said Herb Moniz, who was city manager at the time. "Then it was
deemed a more prestigious neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Moniz--himself the reluctant resident of a true gated community,
explaining that "it was the only house I could find that I
liked"--said city officials decided they could accept a community
that pretended to block itself off as long as it followed the rules
for public roads and other facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics of true gated communities are of the same mind. They
can live with the fakes.</TE>
<TE>   "The fakes seem to have many of the same psychological effects as
gates," said Ed Blakely, who co-wrote "Fortress America: Gated
Communities in the United States," a book considered required reading
for the anti-gate set. "They put people on notice that the area is
protected."</TE>
<TE>   He points out that the fake-gate movement isn't all that new--it's
just gone more upscale. Residents in less well-to-do places began
putting up phony gates and gatehouses about the same time the real
thing took off with buyers in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "They started as a product of economics for people who couldn't
afford real gates," Blakely said.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1990s, more than 8 million Americans were living behind
locked gates. It was about that time that studies by Blakely and
others started showing that real gates don't make most neighborhoods
any safer, and in some cases do the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   "The guards turned out not to be the best guardians of people's
possessions," Blakely said. "In some cases, they were the most likely
to take off with them. You were employing people who make very little
money, know when residents are not at home and are under light
supervision. Some found they could supplement their income by taking
things out of the houses they were supposed to protect."</TE>
<TE>   Fulton, the urban development expert, does think it's a shrewd
move by developers to use the fakes, thus leaving open the
possibility of closing out the rest of the world should the real
thing come back into style. All it would take is putting in a lock
and intercom, or installing a guard in that empty booth.</TE>
<TE>   "You could say the developers are just creating a future option,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Some Seniors Can't, Though These Cancan</HD>
<DH>Dancing: Members of the Valley-based Gingersnaps perform
complex routines across L.A. They say it keeps them young.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Gingersnaps don't kick as high as they once did. Their energy
level dips after 30 minutes or so. But their gams are still shapely,
their formations still tight and their enthusiasm still strong for
doing what they love: dancing.</LD>
<LD>   Formed in 1982, the Gingersnaps are a chorus line of about a dozen
women--many former Broadway showgirls--who practice two or three
times a week and perform at events throughout the Los Angeles area:
last week at the Elks Club in Glendale, next month in Burbank.
Although some confess to being in their 80s, members of the
Gingersnaps refuse to reveal their actual ages.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't tell you how old I am because our director would kill
me," said Ruth Wilson of North Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   Later, as if leaking top-secret information, she quietly admits to
having been born in the early 1920s. "He says we're not supposed to
get applause because of our age, but because of our talent."</TE>
<TE>   The Gingersnaps, who include former opera performers,
vaudevillians and at least one ballerina, are directed by founder and
taskmaster Kendall Capps, a copyright attorney and a senior himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I feel like a lion tamer when I'm up there with the
girls," jokes Capps,  who was born into a theatrical family and was
dancing on stage by age 8. "But I think this group is the best of its
kind anywhere. And I should know. I've seen all the good chorus
lines."</TE>
<TE>   Capps choreographs intricate routines that can last as long as 10
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Kendall's routines are difficult and unique," said Gloria Larson,
who joined the Gingersnaps nearly 20 years ago. "Triple steps, heel
drops, everything, oh boy. But they are so much fun."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of a routine, most of the dancers are exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   "We all get pretty tired, but we keep going," Larson said.</TE>
<TE>   The origin of the Gingersnaps could be traced to a persistent
woman who worked at the Jocelyn Senior Center in Burbank two decades
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I was volunteering there and this woman, Elsabe Slabin, had heard
I had a dancing background and thought it would be a good idea to
start a chorus line at Jocelyn," Capps said.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Capps was not interested. A few weeks later, Slabin
told him he looked as though he needed some exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "She was right," said Capps. "So I decided to give it a try."</TE>
<TE>   Within months, the Gingersnaps were born, with the dancers
choosing the troupe's name.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson is the only original member of the group still dancing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll dance till I fall apart," she said. "I'm going to keep
going. I feel young when I dance."</TE>
<TE>   Some things don't change, she said. Whether you're 18 or 80, men
are still attracted to women who dance, especially women dancing in
high heels and colorful costumes that show off their legs.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we get older men coming on to us," said Wilson, who's
been a widow for 25 years. "That still happens."</TE>
<TE>   Dancing keeps them young, members say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it proves if you keep going on dancing, you'll keep going
on living," said Joanne Drager of Chatsworth. Like most Gingersnaps,
Drager danced professionally.</TE>
<TE>   Born in England, she traveled throughout Europe as a member of the
Cimarro Ballet Company based in Spain before coming to America,
marrying and raising four children.</TE>
<TE>   Although she taught dance at private schools in Northridge, she
thought her performance career was over until she heard of the
Gingersnaps. "I went to see them dance and thought, 'Gee, they're
good,'" said Drager. "I joined them for something to do and to
continue my dancing."</TE>
<TE>   The Gingersnaps are a close-knit group in which members have
developed tight bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a family," she said. "We share good times, bad times."</TE>
<TE>   Larson has had two hip replacements and is still dancing.</TE>
<TE>   "My doctor told me it's the best thing in the world for me," said
Larson, who performed with the Burbank Civic Light Opera for 35
years. "It shows you what you can do if you want it bad enough."</TE>

<HD>A Man of the '60s for the 21st Century</HD>
<DH>Governor's race: Green Party candidate Peter Camejo won't
win, but he wants to make waves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He's a financier who wants to become governor, thinks Californians
are overtaxed and says he is disgusted that Gray Davis failed to
follow basic business principles during the energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The candidate is not Republican Bill Simon Jr., but the Green
Party's nominee for governor, Peter Miguel Camejo. He is probably the
only person on the ballot in November who has sailed in the Olympics,
been expelled from Berkeley, run for president as a Socialist and
founded his own money management firm.</LD>
<LD>   Camejo, 62, travels in a 10-year-old Infiniti convertible
plastered with "Ralph Nader for President" bumper stickers, touting
his new book on socially responsible investing (with introductions
written by both Nader and a former Reagan administration official)
and taking potshots at the political establishment.</LD>
<TE>   On an Oracle official's handing a $25,000 campaign contribution to
Davis' director of e-government in a bar: "If he's going to engage in
corruption, he should at least do it right. It should be in unmarked
bills."</TE>
<TE>   On the prevalence of religion in politics: "If it was really true
that people turn over in their graves, Thomas Jefferson and George
Washington would be sources of perpetual energy."</TE>
<TE>   Camejo says he is under no illusions that he will become
California's next governor--"my wife would kill me"--but relishes the
threat his candidacy could pose to Davis by peeling off liberal
voters. And he says he is unconcerned about the possibility that, if
the race tightens, he could tip the election to the conservative
underdog Simon, far further from Camejo ideologically than Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't solve problems gradually and peacefully," Camejo said.
"You have to make it an explosion."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats say they're not worried. "Since most voters don't take
them seriously, we don't," state party strategist Bob Mulholland said
of the Greens. He noted that after 10 years as an official party,
Greens compose a little less than 1% of California's registered
voters. "There's no more solid evidence of their inability to get any
base in the state of California."</TE>
<TE>   The 146,251 registered California Greens lag far behind the
state's 5.3 million registered Republicans and 6.8 million Democrats.
The Greens racked up nearly 40,000 new California members in 2000
during Nader's presidential run but barely added any voters in the
last year, according to state statistics.</TE>
<TE>   In most California elections, 4% to 5% of the voters abandon the
two major parties to back other candidates, but no single party has
been able to consolidate that wayward segment of the electorate.
Nader pulled 3.8% of California voters during the 2000 presidential
election, but analysts attribute that relatively robust showing
partly to his celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   That means that the only effect Camejo is likely to have on the
governor's race is to take votes from Davis in a tight contest, a
scenario that clearly pleases the Simon campaign. The other
third-party candidates--on the American Independent, Libertarian and
Natural Law tickets--can also only hope to peel a relatively few
votes from the two main parties.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Cain, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, said it's too
early to tell whether Camejo will be a spoiler. "There will be
leftists who will take a look at the Greens," Cain said. "It would
certainly be a help to the Democrats if the guy was a total kook."</TE>
<TE>   Business and Leftist Politics</TE>
<TE>   After 45 minutes of speaking to six UC Santa Cruz students
recently about the need to legalize gay marriage, ban the death
penalty, implement a $10.50 statewide minimum wage and save
California's remaining old-growth forests, Camejo scrunched into a
supporter's hybrid gas-electric car and grabbed his cellular phone.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me what happened at the close?" he asked after exchanging
pleasantries with the caller, a hedge fund manager. "What are the
futures doing now? Did they continue down at the close?"</TE>
<TE>   The Camejo campaign is full of such intersections of 21st century
capitalism and 1960s radicalism. He laces his talks with standard
leftist applause lines--condemning U.S. aggression during the war on
terrorism, or talking about how corporations need to be reined in.</TE>
<TE>   But moments later, he gleefully rattles off terms like "Triple-A
Muni at 10%" while excitedly talking about a new business venture to
structure loans to help homeowners install solar energy. He argues
that California's taxes are too high and that money is wasted on
giveaways to both corporations and public sector unions.</TE>
<TE>   On the stump, Camejo takes on the demeanor of an irascible college
lecturer who has always harbored dreams of becoming a stand-up comic.
In a jacket and slacks with a crown of wiry hair, he skips from one
point to another, hands bouncing, frequently interrupting himself to
make some acidic wisecrack or fulminate about the world's injustices.</TE>
<TE>   One staple is for him to brandish a paper graph of the price of
natural gas in California over the last several years. During a
renewable-energy forum at a library outside Santa Cruz, Camejo traced
the prices as he asked when Davis chose to ink $43 billion in energy
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "Here?" His finger moved up the curve. "Here? No, here!" He
pointed at the peak. "I can see any time now, they'll announce the
worst trade in the history of humanity," Camejo fumed. "This is three
standard deviations off a trend line!"</TE>
<TE>   Camejo's blend of business sense and left-wing politics brings him
full circle. He was born in New York to one of Venezuela's wealthiest
families; his father, Daniel Camejo, is a prosperous resort
developer.</TE>
<TE>   It was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he
enrolled in 1958, that Peter Camejo caught the activism bug. He
dropped out to march for civil rights with Martin Luther King Jr.
and, later, to organize against the Vietnam War. A staunch
anticommunist, Daniel Camejo looked askance at his son's politics,
but the two remained close; they sailed together in the 1960 Olympics
for Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   Like many radicals during the 1960s, Peter Camejo found his way to
Berkeley. His role in campus activism there led then-Gov. Ronald
Reagan to brand him "one of the most dangerous men in America." In
the fall of 1967, as he ran on an activist slate for a position in
student government, police arrested Camejo the night before the
election, apparently for speaking at an unauthorized rally. He was
not charged with a crime, he recalled, but was expelled after winning
the election.</TE>
<TE>   Though he recalls that he remained "pretty square" in personal
demeanor--close-cropped hair, no drugs--Camejo remained something of
a perpetual activism machine for the next decade. He traveled
throughout Latin America trying to free political prisoners. He was
deported from Mexico while trying to liberate his activist brother,
who was at the time imprisoned in Mexico City. Back in the United
States, Camejo in 1976 ran for president on the Socialist ticket. "We
got on the ballot in 18 states," he recalled proudly, and he won
91,314 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the decade, Daniel Camejo recalled fretting about his
son's future. "It was an honor to have a son doing what he was
doing," said the elder Camejo. But, he added, "we tried to induce him
to do something for himself."</TE>
<TE>   As the rollicking '70s moved into the more staid '80s, the younger
Camejo came to a realization: He was unemployed and broke, and did
not even have a college degree. He applied for a job with the post
office in California.</TE>
<TE>   A friend warned that postal work would aggravate Camejo's bad
back. "Go work in one of the brokerage houses," the friend advised.
"They like people who talk real fast."</TE>
<TE>   Camejo landed at Merrill Lynch and began working as a broker. But
he did not lose his political edge. In 1987, when the firm rejected
his proposal to create an individual retirement account that gave
money to AIDS groups, Camejo could not compromise. He formed
Progressive Asset Management, a company in the Bay Area city of
Concord that steers clients' money into companies that follow certain
social criteria--declining to use sweatshop labor, sell firearms and
so on.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his business years, Camejo has kept a toe in leftist
politics. He was one of the original U.S. Green Party members when
the party registered in 1991. He became a trustee of Contra Costa
County's pension fund and led a movement to have it push the
companies it invests in to act progressively.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the California Green Party began to cast about for
candidates for statewide office. Former Rep. Dan Hamburg agreed to
run for governor, and Camejo was poised to put his name on the ticket
for a lower office. But Camejo pulled out at the last minute to fend
off a Wall Street firm's raid on his brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   This year there is nothing holding him back. Next month he will
step down from his position on the Contra Costa County pension board
to free himself up to spend more time campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign Has Small War Chest</TE>
<TE>   The campaign has raised about $20,000 in contributions, usually
netted in small increments at fund-raisers like one held at a brew
pub near UC Davis during the Whole Earth festival. (The campaign
saves money by having the candidate--who said he made $306,000 last
year and is worth "under $2 million"--pay his own travel expenses.)
In contrast, Davis has more than $30 million in the bank and Simon
more than $5 million to communicate with voters via television, radio
and mailings.</TE>
<TE>   Devoting so much time to such an impractical pursuit amuses some
of Camejo's friends, like business colleague Joe Sturdivant. "To be
honest, that is a puzzle," said Sturdivant, a self-described
conservative who has been friends with Camejo for 15 years. "He's fit
into the capitalistic system quite well, but he still cares about
some of the social issues."</TE>
<TE>   The effort makes sense to the candidate. He says he sees it as a
chance to bring more Latinos and other ethnic minorities to the Green
Party and publicize proposed voting reforms that would allow a
run-off should one candidate fail to get the majority of votes--a
method that he argues would break the two major parties' grip on the
electorate.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo says he has changed since he ran for president. "I've
re-evaluated my views about how to achieve things," he said over a
late lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in Marina del Rey. "There's less
nuttiness."</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, Camejo braved a traffic-choked, 21/2-hour drive to
North Hills to speak to about 35 people at a progressive church. To
pass the time until the main speaker arrived, various members of the
crowd took turns addressing the graying audience on the threats of
corporations selling water and the merits of complex, European-style
voting systems.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo gave his standard hourlong talk, taking swipes at Sen.
Barbara Boxer and U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland)--the only member
of Congress to vote against a motion giving President Bush leeway to
retaliate for Sept.11--for saying positive things about the
president's war on terror. After the gathering disbanded, Terrie
Brady approached Camejo and softly said that she thought it was
counterproductive to attack Boxer, one of the nation's most liberal
senators.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo launched into a rapid-fire debate with Brady, tossing out
the names of Bay Area politicians he believed had betrayed their
beliefs. "I don't know the situation," Brady protested.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Camejo replied in a steely tone, "I'm trying to tell you
something.... If you enter politics, you can choose to tell the
truth, or you can lie."</TE>
<TE>   There was a long silence, then Brady and Camejo parted.</TE>

<HD>County Supervisors to Go Live on the Internet</HD>
<DH>Technology: Computer users will be able to view the
meetings, a service offered by few local governments in state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Board of Supervisors meetings are going global.</LD>
<LD>   Starting next week, anyone with an Internet connection can watch
the five politicians hash out county policy, set sewer rates and,
occasionally, trade insults.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County joins only a handful of local governments in
California that have put live sessions on the Internet, said Matt
Carroll, the county's chief information officer.</LD>
<TE>   "This can be a convenient way for the public to view the
government process," he said. "It's a living record of board
meetings."</TE>
<TE>   The county may be particularly well-suited for the technology
because it ranks No. 1 in the state for homes with high-speed
Internet connections, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   The board's weekly Tuesday meeting, which begins at 8:30 a.m.,
will be relayed live with sound and pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we should call it 'Tuesday Morning Live!'" Chief Deputy
Executive Officer Bert Bigler said, joking.</TE>
<TE>   A copy of each meeting will be available on the county's Web page
for three months. That way, someone who wants information on a
particular issue can download previous meetings to see what happened,
Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Meetings will also be available to the public on compact disc.</TE>
<TE>   To find the link to live board meetings, go to the Web page, at
www.countyofventura.org.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors are not meeting this week because of the Memorial Day
holiday. So the public's first chance to check out a live meeting
will be June 4.</TE>
<TE>   Meetings from the past six weeks, however, should be available for
viewing.</TE>
<TE>   The Web meeting coverage came about because Supervisor Frank
Schillo asked last fall that county officials find a way for the
public to view budget deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Videotape was considered but discarded because production costs
were considered too high.</TE>
<TE>   Internet relays have only minimal costs, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   This year's budget sessions begin June 17, not that anyone is
expecting a stampede of Internet surfers visiting the Ventura County
page to find out which department budget is being cut and which is
being spared.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless there's a hot issue, it will probably just be the
government die-hards," said Supervisor John Flynn. "But maybe people
will try it."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he is prepared for his digital debut.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought some makeup--it's called Politician's Delight," he said,
joking. "And I'm considering a hairpiece. But it may be too late for
that."</TE>

<HD>Flags Flutter in an Emotional Day of Salutes to War Dead</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Parades celebrate patriotism. Gov. Davis promises
new housing for vets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF and KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>America's war dead were honored throughout Southern California on
Monday as Gov. Gray Davis promised better services for California's
older and disabled military veterans.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at the flag-bedecked Los Angeles National Cemetery in
Westwood, Davis discussed previously announced proposals for five new
veterans' home facilities in California, including one adjacent to
the graveyard and another in Lancaster.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel duty-bound to do better with veterans' homes in this state
than we've done before," Davis told a crowd of several hundred. "Our
obligation to [veterans] just begins" when they return from overseas,
said Davis, who is running for reelection this year against
Republican Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<TE>   The ceremony in Los Angeles was one of several across the region.
In Seal Beach, hundreds reflected on the role of American submarine
forces in winning World War II, while the annual Memorial Day parade
in Canoga Park drew crowds of area residents along with political
figures and local dignitaries. In San Diego, a ceremony honored a
woman Marine killed in the line of duty this year.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) joined Davis for the
Westwood presentation and said the state's veterans should view the
plans as a sign that they are not being taken for granted. Wesson,
active in advocating the Los Angeles home in his district, recently
worked out a compromise with San Joaquin Valley legislators to build
one in the Fresno area, too.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, there are three veterans' homes in California. The five
new homes, which would serve as many as 1,200 veterans, would be
funded under a federal-state partnership, Davis said. He said that
the home near the cemetery would be for veterans who need skilled
nursing care and the home in Lancaster would provide assisted-living
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The plans for the new homes stem from several proposals currently
before the Assembly. Wesson's plan would use funds from a $50-million
state bond issue approved by voters two years ago for such homes.
California officials say the federal government may provide as much
as $55 million more.</TE>
<TE>   More than 85,000 small American flags fluttered on the National
Cemetery grass during Monday's ceremonies, placed beside each grave
by members of the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. A choir sang anthems.
Men dressed in Civil War uniforms launched cannon fire from vintage
artillery pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Among those listening to the speeches were veterans who have
become fixtures at the annual event.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Johnson, 78, fought in World War II and lost a brother,
Mel, to enemy fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about him all the time," Johnson said. "But it's nice to
see other people think about veterans on Memorial Day."</TE>
<TE>   In the San Fernando Valley, young and old crowded blocked-off
streets for the 14th annual Canoga Park Memorial Day Parade,
sponsored by local businesses and community groups.</TE>
<TE>   Participants included high school marching bands and cheerleaders,
silver-clad equestrian groups and clowns who did magic tricks. Eight
World War II fighter planes swooped low over the delighted crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Clapping, whistling and waving along the sunbathed, two-mile route
were cheering boys with sticky blue cotton candy smeared on their
faces and giggling girls dressed in purple-and-yellow Lakers jerseys.
The smell of horses, suntan lotion and barbecued meat drifted in the
gentle breezes.</TE>
<TE>   It was a multicultural event. Vendors sold red-white-and-blue
Uncle Sam top hats and colorful Mexican sombreros. Bands played John
Philip Sousa marches and mariachi music. Visitors munched on hot dogs
and tacos. There were American flags, Mexican flags and Israeli
flags.</TE>
<TE>   "This parade is what America is all about," said Debora Popowich.
"It says we are truly united."</TE>
<TE>   "This is my style," said her 5-year-old daughter, Natasha, whose
curly hair was decorated with a red, white and blue bandanna and a
couple of little American flags.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in the country of America," Natasha said. "I like it."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Castrellon family of West Hills said they attended
the parade to demonstrate their support for firefighters, police and
paramedics as well as those who gave their lives in the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   "I sometimes think about all that's going on in the world, and how
they're helping us," said 11-year-old Pamela Castrellon. "It's nice
to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Among those riding the parade route in vintage cars were Rep. Brad
Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), Los
Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky and City Councilman Dennis
Zine.</TE>
<TE>   In Seal Beach, about 500 people gathered at the World War II
submarine memorial to pay tribute to the 3,500 American men who gave
their lives in undersea actions between 1941 and 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Military historian Roger McGrath said the submarines played a
vital role during that war, sinking 214 enemy ships.</TE>
<TE>   "What this small force did is stunning," he said. "In effect,
American submarines sank the Japanese empire."</TE>
<TE>   McGrath urged the veterans attending to share their stories in an
effort to prevent Memorial Day from becoming just another excuse for
a three-day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, Memorial Day is buried under motor homes at the beach and
beer cans on the side of the Colorado River," he said. "That's not
saying much for 1 million dead Americans."</TE>
<TE>   As an Explorer Scout played taps on a bugle, veteran Dan Blumberg,
his wife and three children watched as 52 red, white and blue
carnations--one for each U.S. submarine lost in World War II--were
dropped into a shallow pool.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my children to know what happened," Blumberg said. "I
figure that out of 365 days, you can spend two hours remembering
these men."</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, officials unveiled a plaque at the city's Mt.
Soledad War Memorial for Sgt. Jeanette L. Winters, one of seven
Marines killed when a KC-130 air tanker from Miramar Marine Corps Air
Station crashed in Pakistan on Jan. 9. Winters was the first U.S.
servicewoman to die in the war zone.</TE>

<HD>Attias Trial Points Up Dorm Life's Wild Side</HD>
<DH>UC Santa Barbara: Tales of drugs, drinking emerge as
defense says tumult worsened mental state of student who killed four
with his car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>A crowd of students spills out of the Francisco Torres Residence
Hall, laughing and taunting one another on their way out for a night
of partying in Isla Vista.</LD>
<LD>   Of dorm life in the two 10-story towers, Nino Boles-King, 19,
offered a mixed review. "The food [is bad], but it's really easy to
get [messed] up" on drugs and alcohol, he said. That's not the kind
of endorsement managers of the massive student housing complex next
to UC Santa Barbara would like to receive.</LD>
<LD>   But after a Francisco Torres freshman named David Attias ran down
five people in this college community, killing four, it's one they've
had to live down.</LD>
<TE>   "It is sex and drugs and rock and roll, and it's filled with
freshmen," said Abby Pollak of Oakland. Pollak has a special enmity
for the place. Her son, Elie Israel, was one of the four pedestrians
killed by Attias' turbocharged Saab on Feb. 23, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Since Attias' murder trial started several weeks ago, Francisco
Torres has become almost a co-defendant as tales of student excess
emerge from the witness stand.</TE>
<TE>   Attias' attorney, Jack Earley, said the chaotic environment in the
residence hall--the seventh floor, on which Attias lived, was called
the "floor that never sleeps"--exacerbated Attias' long-standing
mental problems.</TE>
<TE>   Earley said his client had a psychotic break as he drove through
Isla Vista spouting rap lyrics he listened to at ear-splitting levels
in his dorm room. Before Francisco Torres, he apparently never
listened to rap.</TE>
<TE>   Earley couldn't say how much blame the residence hall shares for
what happened. "It was a factor in his mental health," he said. "What
percentage it played, I'm not sure."</TE>
<TE>   Under the best conditions, college dorm life is part commune, part
wilderness camp, fragrant with the odors of unwashed socks and
two-week-old pizza boxes. But to hear some people talk, the wild
goings-on in the residence hall, which is affiliated with but not
owned by UC Santa Barbara, would make the fraternity depicted in
"National Lampoon's Animal House" look like a finishing school.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to the testimony last week, one spectator said she's
doubtful she will allow her son to go to UC Santa Barbara. UCLA
suddenly looked a lot better. "There's no partying there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the owner, GMH Associates Inc. in Pennsylvania, along with
college administrators and students, say the residence hall and the
campus have been unfairly demonized because of the Attias case. "We
provide an experience [where students can be] nurtured in a safe
place," insisted June De Ponte, director of marketing for GMH.</TE>
<TE>   On-site managers would not allow a reporter and photographer from
The Times to look around the building Friday night. "We have had
nasty experiences in the past with media," said Casey Hayden, a dorm
official.</TE>
<TE>   Some people say the focus on Francisco Torres is because it houses
so many students, mostly freshmen living away from home for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   "FT is a large building, and it's filled with students under 20,"
said university Dean of Students Yonie Harris. "You're going to have
the normal behavior you expect in young people this age."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a shame people are getting this idea," said Marisa
Lagos, a junior covering the Attias trial for the campus newspaper,
the Daily Nexus.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, UC Santa Barbara and the surrounding community may
have fairly earned a reputation for a lifestyle that was more about
tanning than fanning the pages of textbooks. But that changed when
the faculty started winning Nobel Prizes and competition for
enrollment became more spirited.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a school that's difficult to get in," Lagos said. "You
have to be serious to stay enrolled here."</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Torres' jaunty Web site boasts of its paradisiacal
location "nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Ynez
Mountain range." With room for 1,300 students, the dorm includes two
large cafeterias, a swimming pool, tennis courts, fitness center and
a computer center with unlimited direct access to the Internet--all
for $9,125 a year.</TE>
<TE>   There is no reference to police reports like the one about a
student walking around the fourth floor stairwell, urinating on the
walls as he went. Or to the legendary food fight last year that
authorities say caused $10,000 in damage and caused the residence
hall to install security cameras. Or to the time the fire alarm went
off and so many drunken students were dragged out of the building by
roommates that someone called sheriff's deputies to report a multiple
kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the residence hall's defenders say it's no different from a
lot of student housing. "You can find the same stuff in the on-campus
dorms," said one sheriff's deputy.</TE>
<TE>   But after the Attias case, and the videotaped assault of a
freshman in Isla Vista last year that horrified the community, nobody
in a position of authority is finding much comfort in that. To many
people, the legendary fun-and-sun atmosphere that annually lands UC
Santa Barbara on the list of top party colleges has gotten way out of
hand.</TE>
<TE>   Big Increase Noted in Alcohol-Related Crimes</TE>
<TE>   Crimes involving alcohol in Isla Vista--a student city of 20,000
jammed into less than a square mile, making it one of the most
crowded places west of the Mississippi--have skyrocketed in recent
years. The 796 reports of public intoxication in 2001 were three
times as high as in 1998, according to statistics supplied by the
Sheriff's Department's IV Foot Patrol, which supplies law enforcement
in Isla Vista. Loud party calls increased five times, and urinating
in public more than doubled--to 250 incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Those are just the nuisance, quality-of-life crimes. There were 18
rapes, 22 cases of resisting arrest and more than 100 cases of
battery and spousal abuse.</TE>
<TE>   After a number of incidents in which six people fell off the
cliffs--some as high as 90 feet--overlooking the sea and two of them
died, county officials decided to install security fencing.</TE>
<TE>   Local authorities are now studying laws to severely limit the
weekend bacchanals. On Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors will
consider giving deputies additional authority to declare a party a
public nuisance and shut it down before revelers get out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers will also debate a "Urinating/Defecating in Public
Ordinance" to control the "significant problem" with outdoor
urination.</TE>
<TE>   The ironic thing is that although much of the recent flurry of
activity by government agencies was provoked by the Attias case,
Attias had no alcohol in his system the night of the collision on
Sabado Tarde in Isla Vista.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, his mental deterioration came about after he stopped
taking the psychotropic medication designed to smooth out his
twitchy, impulsive personality, which gave him his nickname, "Crazy
Dave." He had a habit of barging into other students' rooms and
lecturing them on everything from politics to drugs. Far from being
warped by the atmosphere in Francisco Torres, Attias was so
disruptive that his floor mates asked him to leave the floor,
according to evidence at his trial.</TE>
<TE>   And as for defense claims that he was desperately remorseful after
the accident, the prosecution played a chilling tape of a phone call
a cocky-sounding Attias made to a friend after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in an orange suit, dude," he said. He didn't seem worried.
"My dad's on the way. He's got money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His father is television director Daniel Attias. Though some have
pointed fingers at the so-called Hollywood lifestyle, people who know
the family say David Attias was a difficult, demanding child almost
from birth. According to court testimony, he was hospitalized in a
psychiatric unit at 13, when he tried to strangle his sister.</TE>
<TE>   Promises of Change Followed Rampage</TE>
<TE>   After the auto rampage last year, there were public testimonials
and promises that Isla Vista would change.</TE>
<TE>   Some people don't think much is different. A walking tour with the
IV Foot Patrol of the major streets Friday night found the avenues
crowded with students cruise-walking from one party to another.
Blasts of music, like mortars, were going off all around. One of the
largest gatherings was in front of an apartment building, where a
nearly naked man who called himself Extreme Elvis was singing "In the
Ghetto." Nearly naked because he was wearing dark socks and shoes and
nothing else. "We're on tour," he said of his band. "I've got a gig
in L.A. tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Most revelers were having fun. But there were some short tempers
in the crowd, too. Before the night was over, several students showed
up at the local hospitals with broken bones from fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Students living in Francisco Torres said they try to take the good
with the bad. "If you tend to be a party person, it's hard" to break
away and get any work done in the residence hall, said Molly Krain,
19, a Santa Barbara City College student from San Jose. "You have to
be disciplined."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Morgan, an 18-year-old UC Santa Barbara freshman in
pre-psychology, loved her freshman experience at Francisco Torres. Of
course, she asked for, and was granted, a room on the one floor in
the towers designated as a "24-hour quiet floor."</TE>
<TE>   "I have gone to other floors and it's pretty rowdy," she said.</TE>

<HD>Fanciful Ideas Offered to End Police Pursuits</HD>
<DH>Although extreme, one plan was once seriously considered
but dropped over drawbacks. Besides, crooks don't cooperate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Necessity may be the mother of invention, but on today's crowded
freeways it's frustration that really uncorks a flood of ideas.</LD>
<LD>   A couple of readers wrote with suggestions to quickly end those
annoying police pursuits that cause gridlock and headaches on our
already crowded freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Esther Norbut of La Crescenta suggested that police use a
helicopter to lift fleeing motorists off the freeways and set them
down where they can't disrupt the daily commute.</LD>
<TE>   Question: I have wondered why law enforcement does not use
helicopter cranes that are capable of lifting very heavy objects? It
would appear to be so easy, with guidance from the ground and other
copters, to just pluck the wayward auto out of the traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Another reader, Mike Pasternak of Thousand Oaks, wrote to suggest
that police sharpshooters "simply put an armor-piercing round through
the engine block" of the offending motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: OK, so these ideas sound pretty extreme, but consider
this: Los Angeles Police Sgt. Ronald Moen, an expert on police
pursuits, said he once seriously thought about using a helicopter
equipped with a powerful magnet to end such chases.</TE>
<TE>   Moen said he quickly realized the idea had too many drawbacks:
What if the magnet fails as the car hovers 300 feet over a crowded
freeway? How do you keep the occupants of the airborne car from
jumping out? What if the suspect in the car wears lots of chains and
medallions? Wouldn't the metal jewelry be drawn to the magnet, thus
strangling the motorist?</TE>
<TE>   The other problem with both ideas is that police can't always
anticipate the direction of the fleeing motorist. We can't expect a
crook to slow down so the helicopter can position the magnet overhead
or stay in one lane so that the sharpshooter can take aim on the
engine block.</TE>
<TE>   That is the problem with bad guys these days: They are just not
very cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of using deadly force on bad drivers, Burt Prelutsky of
Los Angeles is annoyed with drivers who fail to pull into a signaled
intersection to wait for oncoming traffic to clear before making a
left turn.</TE>
<TE>   He points out that motorists who wait behind the crosswalk make it
nearly impossible for the drivers behind the offending motorist to
make a left turn before the light turns red.</TE>
<TE>   Q: My question is whether it is legal to shoot these people and,
if so, can you collect a bounty on them?</TE>
<TE>   A: Burt, you may want to switch to decaffeinated coffee. It's
certainly a frustrating problem, but lethal force is not warranted.</TE>
<TE>   As for your question, it is perfectly legal and--in many cases
recommended--for motorists to pull into the intersection and wait
before making a left turn.</TE>
<TE>   However, Los Angeles Police Officer Connor MacIvor, a veteran
traffic cop in the San Fernando Valley, notes that there are
exceptions to this rule.</TE>
<TE>   For example, you should not enter the intersection when traffic is
so heavy that you are certain to be stranded in the middle when the
light turns red. You can be cited for blocking traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it is up to each motorist to use common sense in this
situation. (Obviously, common sense is not so common these days.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a related question, Stanley Shyn of La Jolla wanted a
clarification on the rules for making a right turn at an intersection
when a pedestrian is crossing in front of your car.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is there some "halfway point" rule where it might be OK to
complete the right turn if the approaching pedestrian is still closer
to the other side of the street?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is no such rule in the California Driver's Handbook. But
the handbook does say that pedestrians have the right of way at
corners whether or not the crosswalks are painted.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Murphy, founder of the advocacy group Los Angeles Walks
and head of the city's Pedestrian Advisory Committee, said motorists
can make the right turn while a pedestrian is in the crosswalk, but
only if your car is not in danger of hitting or blocking the path of
the pedestrian. She suggests that drivers use common sense--oh,
boy--and remember that most pedestrian deaths occur at intersections.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a column last month, a reader suggested using inflatable walls
to block motorists' views of freeway accidents, thus eliminating that
loathsome human malady: rubbernecking.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, other motorists have written in to suggest solutions,
including this idea from Terry Applegate of Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Instead of an inflatable screen, what about height extenders on
top of the existing center dividers? They could be made of durable
opaque plastic, fiberglass or something similar. While it would be
expensive to retrofit all of the state's freeways, it could be done
as a part of the normal routine maintenance and spread out over
several years.</TE>
<TE>   A: Terry is right. It would be expensive. But the real big costs
would be in the maintenance of such "looky-loo" screens on
California's 15,000 miles of freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans has for years maintained steel mesh "glare screens" along
the top of the freeway dividers in many areas. The prime objective of
the mesh is to block the headlight glare from oncoming cars. But the
mesh routinely deteriorates because of exposure and auto accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The cost and the danger of sending maintenance crews into the
middle of a speeding freeway to replace them has become so high that
Caltrans construction standards now recommend 3-foot-high concrete
"glare screens" on top of the dividers. But those are only allowed if
an in-depth engineering study can justify the cost.</TE>
<TE>   In short, it may be too expensive to design a freeway to eliminate
rubbernecking.</TE>
<TE>   "From a practical point of view, I don't think there is a way to
prevent that random situation," said Chuck O'Connell, a former
Caltrans deputy district director who helped design the Century
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, someday, doctors can isolate the faulty gene in the human
brain that causes motorists to step on the brake and mindlessly stare
at roadside accidents. Hey, there is no harm in dreaming.</TE>
