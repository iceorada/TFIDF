<LD>Big rooms are rough on atmosphere. Even the most accomplished rock
acts can find it hard to cope with all that space. But Tool is all
about atmosphere, a gathering of gloom and thunder designed to rattle
emotions near and far.</LD>
<LD>   That was the sound the Los Angeles prog-metal quartet brought to
the Forum on Monday, a bigger version of the same show Tool performed
last year at the Wiltern Theatre. Some detail was inevitably lost in
the larger setting, but the band made up for it with the size of its
delivery.</LD>
<LD>   Tool was all weight and intensity, by design a heavier package
than the limber experimentation of opening act Tomahawk, a promising
new band fronted by Mike Patton of Faith No More. Tool offered
lumbering grooves and dark themes.</LD>
<TE>   The concert began slowly, with a deep ambient pulse that led to
Tool's signature rock hit "Sober," an intense study of desperation
and release. And for more than 90 minutes Tool performed mostly in
shadows, choosing the kind of anonymity that Pink Floyd once
employed.</TE>
<TE>   Singer Maynard James Keenan appeared to be covered in elaborate
body paint. But most of the visuals were otherwise provided by a pair
of screens, showing endless scenes of decay and dementia created by
guitarist Adam Jones (also an accomplished special-effects artist).
No image of the band itself ever appeared.</TE>
<TE>   As unsettling as those images were, it was the music that cut the
deepest, with Keenan picking up a guitar to add to the dark cascading
patterns of "Schism," a song from last year's "Lateralus" album. It
was mood music on an epic scale.</TE>

<HD>Symphony Hall Building Fund Hits Halfway Mark</HD>
<DH>Donations* Major corporate gifts bolster efforts hampered
by the weakened economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inching forward against an inclement economy, leaders of the Orange
County Performing Arts Center on Tuesday announced that its
$200-million fund-raising campaign to build a new symphony hall has
reached the halfway mark, thanks to $3.5 million in new corporate
donations.</LD>
<LD>   The gifts--$1.5 from Fluor Corp. in Aliso Viejo and $1 million
each from the Times Mirror Foundation, headquartered in Los Angeles,
and Costa Mesa's ICN Pharmaceuticals--were the first new ones
announced since last October.</LD>
<LD>   The center also announced that the restaurant in the new hall,
which will go up across the street from the existing center, will be
named Ralph's Cafe Rouge in honor of a $5-million gift from the Ralph
and Eleanor Leatherby Foundation that had been pledged last fall but
not made public. Ralph W. Leatherby, an insurance executive, was also
a big band buff whose imagination was captured as a teen by swing
music broadcasts from a New York City ballroom called Cafe Rouge.</LD>
<TE>   Fund-raising will go forward under a new chairman, expected to be
Paul F. Folino, a high-tech executive who would take the Costa Mesa
center's top post after helping to lead a successful $40-million
fund-raising campaign as president of the neighboring theater
company, South Coast Repertory.</TE>
<TE>   Folino, chief executive of the Costa Mesa-based Emulex Corp.,
would arrive as a white knight of sorts, after turmoil erupted in the
spring because of a lawsuit among members of the center's board.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, over a business investment gone bad, had nothing to do
with the center, but it led to the resignation of two donors on the
board, Broadcom Corp. partners Henry T. Nicholas III and Henry
Samueli, who said they could no longer serve with four board members
who were part of the suit against them.</TE>
<TE>   One of the plaintiffs, Thomas T. Tierney, had been in line for the
center's chairmanship; in April he stepped aside in favor of Folino
because of the suit. Folino was expected to be formally elected
chairman at a Tuesday evening meeting of the center's board.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit did not hurt the fund-raising campaign, outgoing
chairman Roger T. Kirwan said Tuesday. The economy has been another
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Most everybody on our list had their financial lives disrupted if
not seriously hurt" by market downturns, Kirwan said. "Those who have
been very generous in the past have said, 'I'd like to do more, but
this is the most I'm comfortable committing to.' "</TE>
<TE>   Kirwan and Henry T. Segerstrom, the Costa Mesa shopping center
mogul who has been the center's biggest donor, will chair the
fund-raising campaign, taking over from another former center
chairman, Mark Chapin Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,000-seat concert hall, scheduled to open in September 2005,
would give the center a space tailored for classical music and free
more dates for opera, Broadway musicals and pop concerts at the
3,000-seat Segerstrom Hall, which center officials consider booked to
the gills. With $100 million in the kitty, the center should be able
to start building in January while still working to get the rest of
the needed donations, said center President Jerry E. Mandel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough, much tougher than I thought it was going to be,"
Mandel said. "But we're still getting gifts, and the interest is out
there."</TE>
<TE>   The center essentially broke even on its day-to-day operations for
2001-02, according to unaudited figures released for the fiscal year
that ended June 30. Like all major nonprofit performing arts
organizations, the center does not expect to cover its costs at the
box office and relies on donations to bridge the gap between earnings
and expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts to the operating and endowment funds totaled $7.28 million,
just enough to make up that difference.</TE>
<TE>   The center's earnings dropped from $23.5 million in 2000-01 to
$19.2 million, which officials attributed to a 2 1/2-month closure
for renovation. Paid attendance was off 16.8%, from 497,500 in
2000-01 to 439,365. Expenses also fell, from $30.4 million to $26.4
million. In the face of a collapsing stock market, the endowment
tumbled 8.8%, from $22.8 million to $20.8 million.</TE>

<HD>30 Seconds to Achieve Your 15 Minutes</HD>
<DH>Television* On Fox's new '30 Seconds to Fame,' brevity is
the heart of show biz. Contestants will have that amount of time to
make an impression.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SORINA DIACONESCU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Schoeman, a retired social worker from New York City who will
turn 80 next week, sat in a dressing room on the Hollywood lot of TV
station KTLA last week and waited for her turn to perform a rap
routine built around the lyric "I'm a sexy granny."</LD>
<LD>   Her hair was styled in blond curls. She wore a short skirt and a
lace blouse. In a few hours, she would climb on a nearby sound stage
and spend 30 seconds flaunting her rhyming chops in front of TV
cameras and a studio audience for a chance to win $25,000. For the
moment, though, she was enjoying dessert, courtesy of the Fox
network. "I love acting. I would get up on stage every morning,
afternoon and evening," she said, pushing aside a paper plate piled
high with cake. As for displaying her talents on television, she
said, "I'm not doing it for the money."</LD>
<LD>   Schoeman, who raps under the name Fruity Nutcake, came to Los
Angeles to appear on a weekly television show called "30 Seconds to
Fame." The program premieres tonight on Fox, home to another talent
show that has enjoyed success this summer: "American Idol."</LD>
<TE>   On "Idol," singing hopefuls endure the often rabid scrutiny of a
panel of judges, with winners selected by a voting process that
relies on viewers at home. The show has pulled in around 10 million
viewers for its Tuesday edition and slightly fewer on Wednesdays,
according to Nielsen Media Research. Those figures make it one of the
10 most-watched prime-time programs this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "30 Seconds to Fame," billed as "the fastest-moving talent show
ever," pines for a similar response. The program is the brainchild of
television producers Michael Binkow and Joe Revello, who set out to
update a format already seen in the 1950s and '60s on "Ted Mack's
Original Amateur Hour" and in the '70s on "The Gong Show."</TE>
<TE>   On those programs, Binkow said, ordinary folk may have had the
luxury to display a particular talent at leisure, but nowadays
"things are moving much quicker." The half-minute time limit was
introduced for the benefit of increasingly jittery audiences, he
said. "We think of this show as a remote control: You watch someone
for 30 seconds, and if you don't like their act, it's over."</TE>
<TE>   At the taping of the first episode last week, 24 contestants lined
up in the wings. Among the acts were two tap-dancing brothers, a
comedian who mimicked Rodney Dangerfield in Spanish, a young man who
juggled three whirring chainsaws, a magician who extinguished flames
that seemingly came out of his wrists, a woman who sang the national
anthem complete with an echo ("Oh say, say, say ... can you, you, you
see ..."), a quintet of acrobats from Africa, a ventriloquist and an
old-fashioned clown. Their routines, which flowed into one another
seamlessly, were promptly ended by a gong when the time ran out.</TE>
<TE>   The mostly young and collegiate studio audience, instructed before
the show to laugh and clap in the right places, responded
enthusiastically during the first round of the program. Then it came
time to decide which three contestants would advance to the second
round, with audience members recording their votes--"One is yes; two
is out"--on keypads.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the "Stupid Human Tricks" of "Late Show With David
Letterman," most acts on "30 Seconds" were hardly bizarre. That may
be because half of the contestants, according to the producers of the
show, are based in Los Angeles, and a lot of them are professional
entertainers, not ordinary Joes. A large number carried membership
cards in the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists. For these performers, the show's allure
has less to do with the taste of the fleeting fame something like
"Human Tricks" offers than with the chance to advance their
show-business careers.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought if some random producer is watching this on TV,
then maybe he'll remember me," said Danielle Hartnett, 24, after she
found out that her routine, which encompassed "operatic tap dance
with musical theater and soul stylings," did not carry her through to
the second round of the show.</TE>
<TE>   Hartnett lives in Santa Monica and has a degree in American
studies from Yale University but is pursuing a career as an actress.
She had no illusions about winning the cash prize, she said; as a
member of AFTRA, she settled for the standard union $1,008
performance fee she received for participating in the show. (Nonunion
contestants earn at least $250 for being on the show in addition to
three days' worth of lunches. Out-of-towners receive an extra $150 in
pocket money, and Fox picks up the tab for hotel accommodations.)</TE>
<TE>   When asked why he had come to perform, Chad Taylor, a Santa Monica
comedian who bragged about having juggled everything from chainsaws
to his "ex-girlfriend's implants" on the nightclub circuit, said, "It
was a job, basically." He had tried his luck on talent shows that
accepted only amateurs as contestants and was glad, he said, that "30
Seconds" also welcomed professionals like him.</TE>
<TE>   Additional contestants patiently waited for their turn. Among them
was Olga Polonciuc, 33, a recent immigrant from the Moldova Republic
who now lives in Las Vegas. A circus artist in her native country,
Polonciuc has close-cropped blond hair and the lithe physique of a
ballerina. Her act consists of spinning a metal cube frame around
herself, which she initially developed on the circus stage. She is
not a member of any actors union but said, "It's fantastic to be on a
TV show. You can do everything you want in this country."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "30 Seconds to Fame" premieres tonight at 8 on Fox. The network
has rated it TV-G (suitable for all ages).</TE>

<HD>It's Time for Jackson to Face the Music</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Michael Jackson story has turned from sad to shameless as pop's
would-be king has become pop's disgrace.</LD>
<LD>   By accusing Sony Music Entertainment of causing his last album to
tank by failing to properly promote it, Jackson, a man perversely
obsessed with his own physical appearance, has revealed a desperate,
ugly side of himself.</LD>
<LD>   Even for someone whose name is synonymous with bizarre behavior,
Jackson's latest outburst was startling--especially in its use of the
race card.</LD>
<TE>   At a news conference with the Rev. Al Sharpton in Harlem on July
6, Jackson branded Thomas D. Mottola, chairman of Sony Music
Entertainment Inc., as "racist" and "very, very, very devilish."</TE>
<TE>   This may be the first time, in the long, frequently combative
relationship between musicians and record companies, that a record
executive rather than an artist comes across as the victim.</TE>
<TE>   The charge that Mottola is racist and that Sony penalizes black
artists is troubling because it makes a mockery of all the legitimate
complaints by scores of black artists from the early days of rock and
R&amp;B over poor royalty rates, bad publishing deals and the like.</TE>
<TE>   While Jackson, who has what is believed to be the most lucrative
contract in the music business, jets around the world and dines with
Elizabeth Taylor, many of those veteran artists are still struggling
to find the money to pay the month's rent.</TE>
<TE>   Even Sharpton, the flamboyant New York civil rights crusader who
often seems guilty of overstatement himself, has since distanced
himself from the racism charge.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, whose albums for Sony's Epic label have sold more than
100 million copies over the last two decades, said Sony and Mottola
failed to adequately promote Jackson's last album--the ironically
titled "Invincible." He has also accused Sony of blocking the release
of a charity single he organized.</TE>
<TE>   In trying to fix blame for his continuing career tailspin, Jackson
seems to be pointing a finger at everyone but the one responsible:
the man in the mirror. How far are we from Jackson blaming the Bush
tax cut for the disappointing sales of "Invincible"?</TE>
<TE>   You need look no further than the music itself to understand why
Jackson's album sales have dropped steadily since the unprecedented
peak of "Thriller" 20 years ago. The singer's records have become so
sterile that they are virtually unlistenable.</TE>
<TE>   For many movers and shakers in the industry, Jackson was a lost
cause years ago. Where "Thriller" established Jackson as the most
valuable property in the music world, he had slipped so badly by 1993
that he had fallen out of the top 10 when The Times asked 25 industry
leaders to name the artists they'd most want on their labels. Things
were worse for Jackson in a follow-up survey by The Times in 1995.
The singer had fallen out of the top 20.</TE>
<TE>   "Thriller" became the biggest-selling album in history, thanks in
part to some of the most ambitious (and costly) promotional music
videos ever made. But Sony had something to promote in "Thriller." It
was filled with moments of genuine passion and craft. "Billie Jean,"
with its sensual, tense rhythms, remains one of the great recordings
of the modern pop age. And Jackson was even more magical live, where
his "moonwalk" dance steps--which seemed to amplify all the
self-affirmation and artistic ambition of the album--electrified
audiences night after night on tour.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since "Thriller," however, Jackson has appeared to be less
interested in making artful, heartfelt music as he is in simply
trying to set new sales records. Increasingly, his albums have felt
artificial and cold--as if the individual tracks are simply
calculated attempts to reflect the commercial strains of the day.
"Invincible" is the low point--a work that is frequently sappy,
derivative and labored.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, however, seems to think promotion can make up for his
musical deficiencies--hence his idea that the album didn't sell
because Sony didn't spend enough money trying to drum up enthusiasm
for it.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone should be complaining about Sony, it's the company
stockholders. On the chance that Jackson would again strike
commercial gold as he did in "Thriller," Sony has been showering his
projects with millions. The label claims to have spent $25 million to
promote "Invincible," and it could have spent $50 million without
success.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is mad now because the record company has come to its
senses--and he seems to be doing everything he can to lash out at the
company and its chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say attorneys for Jackson are preparing to file a
breach-of-contract suit against the company, accusing the company of
using questionable accounting practices to cheat the singer out of
royalty earnings. Jackson may be on strong ground in this area.
Whenever recording artists audit label books, they invariably seem to
find they are owed money.</TE>
<TE>   But the singer did the entire artist's rights movement a
disservice by linking his concerns about accounting practices with
his personal attack on Mottola and the label.</TE>
<TE>   His charge that the label blocked the release of "What More Can I
Give," an all-star charity single spearheaded by Jackson, blew up in
Jackson's face when it was subsequently learned that project was, in
fact, abandoned by Jackson's advisors after they discovered that the
record's executive producer had ties to the gay porn business.</TE>
<TE>   By then, McDonald's had already backed out of distributing the
single at its restaurants after receiving complaints that the
fast-food franchise would form a partnership with someone who had
settled a child molestation suit.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson needs to take swift action to salvage what is left of his
tarnished image. There is a tendency to still think of him as the
youthful boy of those wonderful "Thriller" videos and Jackson 5
records. But Jackson is 43. It's time for him to grow up and take
responsibility for his actions. Jackson could start by apologizing to
Mottola, his fans and all the struggling black artists whose music
helped inspire him.</TE>

<LD>I'm here to make good pictures. If I don't see it, I won't touch it.
I may not make a good picture, but I still gotta believe in it!</LD>
<LD>   --William Wyler</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   William Wyler was the invisible director. He felt the director's
hand shouldn't be evident in a movie. "It's 80% script and 20% you
get great actors," he once said. "There's nothing else to it."</TE>
<TE>   Wyler, the subject of an upcoming tribute and retrospective, was
selling himself short. A master craftsman, he was considered one of
the top directors in Hollywood from 1933 until 1968, winning Academy
Awards for best director for 1942's "Mrs. Miniver," 1946's "The Best
Years of Our Lives" and 1959's " Ben-Hur." All of those films also
won Oscars for best film. He was drawn to the written word, adapting
such novels and plays as "Wuthering Heights" (1939), "Dodsworth"
(1936), "Ben-Hur" (1959), "Detective Story" (1951) and "Funny Girl"
(1968) for the big screen.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Wyler, the director's daughter who was named after the
"Wuthering Heights" heroine, says her father had two criteria when it
came to picking projects. Wyler, who directed the 1986 documentary
"Directed by William Wyler," said her father "loved writers. He
enjoyed the process of working with writers and good writing, so I
think that is often what led him to plays. But on the other hand, he
was easily bored and he always wanted to follow whatever the last
picture was with something really different."</TE>
<TE>   Wyler fell out of favor in the 1960s when critics began to praise
the work of "auteur" directors such as Sam Fuller, John Ford, Howard
Hawks, Orson Welles and Nicholas Ray, who put their personal stamp on
each film. Catherine Wyler says her father was hurt by the backlash.
"That was a really hard time for him because he kept on with his
philosophy that the director should be invisible and try to tailor
himself to the subject. He was born in Alsace-Lorraine, spoke French
and felt such a kinship to that part of the world. He used to say he
was one of the few directors in Hollywood who can pronounce auteur
theory properly and yet he was completely cast aside by them."</TE>
<TE>   In honor of Wyler's centennial, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Science and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art are celebrating
his work with a five-week tribute that begins Thursday at the Samuel
Goldwyn Theater with the screening of his first big critical hit,
1933's "Counsellor-at-Law," based on the Elmer Rice play about a
Jewish lawyer (John Barrymore). A panel discussion will follow the
movie with director Vincent Sherman, who appeared in the film;
Carroll Baker who worked with Wyler on 1958's "The Big Country";
Terence Stamp, who starred in Wyler's controversial 1965 thriller,
"The Collector"; and Wyler's good friend, Oscar-winning screenwriter
Fay Kanin</TE>
<TE>   The LACMA arm of the festival follows on Friday with 1953's
romantic comedy "Roman Holiday," starring Audrey Hepburn in her
Oscar-wining performance as a European princess who skips out of the
palace while visiting Rome), and 1935's charming "The Good Fairy,"
starring Margaret Sullavan--then married to Wyler--as a naive cinema
usherette.</TE>
<TE>   One of Wyler's big champions is his granddaughter, Amy Lehr, a
children's television producer who was 10 when he died in 1981. Lehr
worked with the studios to get new prints struck of her grandfather's
films and set up major retrospectives of his work all over the
country, including Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   His versatility, she says, works for him and against him. "That's
why I sort of have been pushing his name so much to my generation,"
says Lehr. "He doesn't have a signature. He's not Hitchcock. People
don't necessarily know his name, but they do know his films." Ian
Birnie, the head of LACMA's film department, points out that no one
has really examined Wyler's oeuvre for decades. "The last
retrospective in L.A. was at LACMA in 1976," he says. "We call the
series 'The Tradition of Excellence' because his films are so
excellent. There is excellent acting, wonderful design, beautiful
scripts, brilliantly conceived projects."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a theme that runs through his films, adds Birnie, it
is the fact that most of his leading characters were rebels or
outsiders like the conniving Southern belle in 1938's "Jezebel," the
moody Healthcliff in "Wuthering Heights" and the murderous housewife
in 1940's "The Letter."</TE>
<TE>   "Even when they are punished or destroyed or resolutely outside
society ... there is an enormous sense of sympathy for these people,"
says Birnie. "They are quite rich and complex characters."</TE>
<TE>   Wyler had a knack with actors, with an unprecedented 38 performers
winning Academy Awards for their performances.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he knew what he wanted, but it wasn't something he could
specify," says his daughter. "What he wanted was a commitment of
complete honesty and reality, and that wasn't something you could
vocalize. But that is why his films are so good today."</TE>
<TE>   Baker enjoyed working with Wyler on the "The Big Country." Wyler,
she says, had a similar style to George Stevens, with whom she worked
in 1956's "Giant."</TE>
<TE>   "They were great film painters," she says. "The thing that both of
them did, which I don't think they could do today, is that they do
takes many times. A lot of times I wouldn't understand why we were
doing a scene over and over again. I think actually both of them were
always looking to see if there was going to be some sort of a
wonderful accident or the light was going to change. Actually, I miss
that filming technique."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the director's nickname was "Forty Take Wyler" due to the
numerous takes he required from his actors with each scene. A lot of
actors complained about his style.</TE>
<TE>   "He was articulate as a social being, but he was inarticulate, I
guess, in telling them how he wanted it," says Kanin. "There is a
great story that Larry Olivier went crazy--take after take after
take. Then he said, 'Willy, how do want me to do it?' Willy said,
'Better.' "</TE>

<HD>Cousteau Finds No-Nonsense Depths</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The London-based band Cousteau is a luxurious cross between the
perversely bittersweet orchestrations of a Burt Bacharach and the
obsessively polished romanticism of a Roxy Music.</LD>
<LD>   But although Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry peppered his ornate
creations with a constant undercurrent of irony and kitsch, there's
no hidden agenda, no underlying sarcasm, in Cousteau's darkly
melodramatic universe.</LD>
<LD>   The band's no-nonsense approach was apparent Monday at the
Troubadour, when the combo (enhanced by guitarist Tom Clues)
performed its sophisticated brand of nocturnal chamber pop with the
kind of self-centered conviction one encounters in a young poet in
love with the concept of being in love.</LD>
<TE>   Cousteau has catchy hooks to spare. In fact, the addictive
melodies of such tunes as the soulful "Talking to Myself" and the
jazzy "After the Fall" made for a certain sameness of character in
the group's material.</TE>
<TE>   In lead singer Liam McKahey, the band has found the perfect
spokesman for its twisted aesthetic. A charismatic crooner who
switches between a comforting baritone and an edgy falsetto, McKahey
began Monday's set dressed in an old-fashioned jacket, snapping his
fingers like a young Sinatra.</TE>
<TE>   The group's other key member, Beirut-born multi-instrumentalist
Davey Ray Moor, was absent from Monday's show because of visa
problems.</TE>

<HD>His 'Scrubs' Role Is Just What the Doctor Ordered</HD>
<DH>Television* John C. McGinley, memorable in smaller roles,
gets attention and Emmy buzz as Dr. Perry Cox.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANICE RHOSHALLE LITTLEJOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The vistas of the Santa Monica Mountains and Pacific Ocean pour into
the wall-length windows of John C. McGinley's Malibu home. Taking in
the beauty of this perfect July afternoon, one wonders why he spends
time holed up in a dark, sparsely decorated basement.</LD>
<LD>   Yet it is there, in his "rehearsal room," where the actor pores
over scripts to give life to the mercurial Dr. Perry Cox, the
character he plays in NBC's medical comedy "Scrubs," which has
finished its first season and takes up residence after "Friends" in
the fall.</LD>
<LD>   "I go downstairs and don't come up from there until I get that
stuff hammered in my skull, until I can do it water skiing or jumping
out of a plane," McGinley says, munching tortilla chips in his dining
room. "It's all about the text, flushing it out, to excavate, to
really get in there and see what falls through your fingers."</LD>
<TE>   Critics have singled out McGinley's performance in the show, with
TV Guide's Matt Roush calling him a "scene stealer," a common
description that has become his nickname on the set. He was also
nominated for outstanding individual achievement in comedy by the
Television Critics Assn., putting him alongside series leads Denis
Leary ("The Job"), Bernie Mac ("The Bernie Mac Show") and Ray Romano
("Everybody Loves Raymond").</TE>
<TE>   "This is a part that really lets him shine," says "Scrubs"
creator-executive producer Bill Lawrence. "This is a guy who plotted
his career well in films as being the character guy and the fringe
guy, somebody that you remember. I just think it's John's turn to be
recognized for what is a pretty outstanding career."</TE>
<TE>   In "Scrubs," McGinley's first prime-time series, the actor has
taken a different approach by infusing a little heart into Cox's
cynical veins. His blend of swagger and sweetness has pushed him to
the forefront of the ensemble cast and drawn comparisons to such
comic actors as Alan Alda, Ed Asner and David Hyde Pierce.</TE>
<TE>   It has also prompted speculation about whether he can join their
Emmy-nominated ranks as a candidate for best supporting actor--one of
the toughest fields in prime time, with past winners including
"Frasier's" Pierce and "Will &amp; Grace's" Sean Hayes--when nominees are
announced Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "McGinley has the best chance among the freshman contenders," said
Thomas O'Neil, author of "The Emmys."</TE>
<TE>   McGinley spent much of the 1980s and '90s on the sidelines of
Hollywood, becoming Oliver Stone's go-to guy with roles in six of the
director's films, including "Platoon," "Wall Street" and "Any Given
Sunday." His characters have often been brutish wackos, combining
wild physical energy and riveting emotional depth.</TE>
<TE>   Paying his dues as a character actor, McGinley made his feature
film debut in Alda's "Sweet Liberty" and has appeared in more than 50
films.</TE>
<TE>   Actor-director Eriq La Salle, who cast McGinley in his film short
"Psalms From the Underground," in an HBO feature called "Rebound" and
in an upcoming independent feature called "Crazy as Hell," due in
September, agrees that McGinley was bound to capture the spotlight
once he found a project that showcased his talents.</TE>
<TE>   "As with George Clooney, who had done eight television series
before 'ER,' it's the right one at the right time," says La Salle,
McGinley's New York University Graduate School classmate. "John has
been doing good work for a long time. This one just really suits
him."</TE>
<TE>   McGinley regards Cox as "the best role I've ever had," in part
because of what he calls "collaboration" with his son Max, who was
born four years ago with Down syndrome. (He shares custody with
former wife Lauren Lambert.)</TE>
<TE>   "I can do all of this Oliver Stone intensity stuff," says
McGinley, "then Max comes along and wraps love around it, and all of
a sudden you have Dr. Cox, who is an amalgamation of those things. It
never occurred to me to do that [with a character] before. And I
don't know if I even did it consciously."</TE>
<TE>   "Max introduced John to the total John," says La Salle, noting
that McGinley's softer side has existed for years but that the actor
may not have given himself permission to express it. "Now Max has
come along, and it's not an option anymore," La Salle says.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Scrubs" performed reasonably well on Tuesday nights
after "Frasier," going up against the CBS juggernaut "Survivor" in
its new slot Thursdays at 8:30 p.m. is a source of concern.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows the difficulties of that time period," says
Stephen McPherson, president of Touchstone Television, which produces
the series. "I'm encouraged to go into it as a second-season show
that's got some traction, that's got an audience. I think we'll find
new viewers there, but we'll also bring new viewers to that night."</TE>
<TE>   The next season of "Scrubs" will find Dr. Cox "a continued
reluctant mentor to the younger coeds of the ensemble," says
Lawrence, "but we'll really amp up his self-destructive romantic life
to a new, horrifying extent. There will be major, major issues with
his ex-wife," played by Lawrence's wife, actress Christa Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the Emmys have in store, McGinley says he's prepared. "It
all seems like a wonderful fuss right now, and that's terrific, but
it doesn't amount to anything. Not yet."</TE>

<LD>Emmy Award nominations will be unveiled Thursday amid the usual pomp
and circumstance, or as much pomp as can be mustered at 5:35 a.m.
Pacific time, when the announcement--timed for live consumption by
the New York-based network morning shows--will take place.</LD>
<LD>   Those few minutes will no doubt come off flawlessly, providing
fodder for "Entertainment Tonight," E! Entertainment Television and
other media parasites who draw sustenance from Hollywood's
back-patting exercises. For the most part, such outlets tend to focus
on the smoke and flames, paying no attention to those behind the
curtain pulling the levers.</LD>
<LD>   That would be the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, an entity
with mercifully little public profile beyond its role in presenting
the Emmys. "Mercifully," because as dysfunctional show-business
organizations go, the academy in recent years has rivaled the Screen
Actors Guild, leaving observers of the group asking questions whose
answers don't begin with, "And the winner is ..."</LD>
<TE>   For starters, the academy has been without a president since
December, when its "executive committee" opted not to renew the
contract of the top full-time staff member, Jim Chabin. The decision
came as a surprise, since the academy had just nimbly weathered last
year's Emmys, which were twice postponed and shrouded in security
concerns by the events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Academy insiders say various factors strained the relationship
between Chabin and the elected chairman, Bryce Zabel, among them
jockeying over who would act as the primary spokesman with outlets
such as the "Today" show--an assertion Zabel has denied. Still, the
academy has refused to discuss what prompted Chabin's release.
Whatever the cause, some board members were upset enough by how the
situation was handled they sought to challenge the board, only to be
dismissed on procedural grounds.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the nonprofit group has been operating without a
president for the past seven months, while Zabel--a writer-producer
filling a volunteer role--tries to run the show. A spokeswoman said
the academy hopes to select a replacement before this year's Emmy
ceremony in September, after issuing a statement saying details of
its search "have remained confidential to avoid compromising the
positions of candidates who are currently employed with other
organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Uh-huh. Well, when Dick Cheney takes the job, let us know.</TE>
<TE>   Although the academy exists primarily so TV industry folk can
network and hand out awards, that response is indicative of a
leadership that takes itself too seriously. Perhaps that's why of the
11,000 academy members who work (or in many instances, have worked
but aren't doing much right now) in television, few actively
participate. For example, a mere 150 people showed up for last year's
annual meeting at the academy's 600-seat theater in North Hollywood,
and the most probing question from the floor was why booze isn't
served at events.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, a few of those who do take part tend to get carried
away, leading during the past few years to internal feuds in which
anonymous letters have circulated among board members. At times,
these shenanigans have been more entertaining than most of the
sitcoms in Emmy contention, but they may also have fed a perception
that getting involved might be more trouble than it's worth.</TE>
<TE>   Another major question mark hovers over who will televise the
Emmys and how much they'll pay for those rights. An agreement under
which the four leading broadcast networks share the show on a
rotating basis expires this year, and sources say preliminary talks
about a new deal began this week.</TE>
<TE>   Academy officials--citing the $50-million and $20-million annual
fees, respectively, reaped by the Oscars and Grammys--have stated a
desire to significantly increase the $3 million or so the Emmys earn,
which provides more than a quarter of the group's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, going for the gold comes with a risk. In the past,
the academy has raised its fee by striking exclusive deals with a
single network, but doing so alienated rival broadcasters, who
threatened to boycott the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Academy negotiators thus find themselves between the proverbial
rock and hard place. Sure, the networks love being honored with
awards, but tight-fisted executives aren't of a mind to spend more
for anything as their stock prices tumble. Yet seeking a more
lucrative deal elsewhere--perhaps even at a cable network--would not
only deny some viewers access to the show but also undermine it as a
unified celebration of television's best.</TE>
<TE>   For all these headaches, the academy does considerable good that
shouldn't be overlooked. Its charitable foundation oversees college
internships and awards as well as the Archive of American
Television--a noble endeavor that remembers the industry's pioneers
(even if current TV executives have forgotten) by conducting and
preserving lengthy interviews with them.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, though fans often quibble over choices and
oversights--including a historic stodginess when it comes to
recognizing new talent--the Emmys can at least point to a relatively
pristine voting process and telecast, setting them apart in notable
ways from other TV awards. That includes the People's Choice and TV
Guide Awards--where winners are tipped off in advance to ensure their
attendance--or the Golden Globes, which despite gaining prestige
since moving to NBC still seem to correlate strongly with the size of
stars' "Q" popularity scores and studio gift baskets.</TE>
<TE>   Installing a president empowered to implement goals and bring
continuity to the organization would certainly be a step in the right
direction, as would securing a TV deal providing a respectable bump
in pay that doesn't require shifting the Emmy telecast to the Outdoor
Life Network.</TE>

<LD>   Big Hopes for Broadway's 'Hairspray'</LD>
<LD>   Previews of "Hairspray," the '60s-tinged, fat-liberation-themed
musical based on the 1988 John Waters film, begin on Thursday. And
its life, thus far, has been charmed.</LD>
<TE>   After rave reviews in its out-of-town Seattle tryout, theater Web
sites are filling with positive buzz about Marc Shaiman's score and
the cast--most notably Harvey Fierstein ("Torch Song Trilogy") as a
big-hearted housewife.</TE>
<TE>   Though advance sales for the show fall short of the $14 million
racked up by "The Producers," they're creeping up to the $5-million
mark, New York magazine reports. Bloomingdale's will be filling its
windows with "Hairspray"-themed merchandise. Shoshanna Lonstein,
former girlfriend of Jerry Seinfeld, is among the designers who've
created a line of narrow-waisted, full-skirted dresses for the
store's "Hairspray" boutique.</TE>
<TE>   Staged by Jack O'Brien, artistic director of San Diego's Old Globe
Theatre, the musical revolves around an overweight girl who snags a
spot on a TV dance show, winning the affections of the local
heartthrob along the way. Call it whatever you will, says
Waters--just don't call it "camp."</TE>
<TE>   "Camp is two older gentleman talking about Rita Hayworth as they
hang their Tiffany lamps," said the director, a paid consultant on
the show. "Camp is something that's so bad it's good. But I think
'Hairspray's' so good, it's great."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   HMOs Often Villains on Hospital Dramas</TE>
<TE>   TV's hospital dramas regularly address important health policy
issues such as patients' rights, managed care and the right to die,
according to a study of the 2000 television season just released by
the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Other hotly debated topics
such as prescription drug coverage for the elderly or the uninsured,
however, were found to be missing from the airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   The findings were discussed Tuesday in a Washington, D.C., forum
titled "John Q Goes to Washington: Health Policy Issues in Popular
Culture." Representatives from Hollywood, including the medical
supervisors of "ER" and "Third Watch," joined members of the health
policy community.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found that medical dramas feature an average of one
scene per episode tackling public policy on health care. While 48% of
these scenes presented both sides of the issues in an evenhanded
manner, they said, the rest were evenly split between positions
favoring the current policy and those attacking the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   The only health care figures consistently portrayed more
negatively than positively were insurance companies, lawyers and
HMOs--the last "still the bad guys as far as TV is concerned,"
according to Vicky Rideout, a vice president of the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Greek Government Accused of 'Vandalism'</TE>
<TE>   Greece has been trying for years to get the British Museum to
return the fifth century Elgin marbles, statues that have been in the
possession of the institution since 1816. To turn up the heat, the
country is building a lavish museum at the base of the Parthenon that
will house the treasures, assuming the issue is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone, however, is in favor of the idea. In building the
edifice, critics say, authorities are destroying a valuable
archeological site--one containing the remains of an ancient
Christian city and Roman baths dating from the late Neolithic era to
the post-Byzantine period.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, conservative Parliament member Petros Tatoulid launched
a lawsuit in Greece's Supreme Court against "those destroying our
cultural heritage." And on Monday, 300 Greek archeologists and
architects denounced the "cultural vandalism" in a petition, as
bulldozers razed the site.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we ask for the Elgin marbles back when, in effect, we are
destroying other marbles to house them?" asked Professor Giorgos
Dontas, president of Athens' renowned archeological society.</TE>
<TE>   Greek culture minister Evangelos Venizelos delayed the laying of
the building's foundation stone last week. But he rejected the
accusation that the findings were significant enough to delay
construction. "Wherever you excavate in Athens you come across
antiquities, and research has shown that these are not valuable," he
said, adding that the museum will be built by 2004--when the city is
hosting the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a GOP activist, told about 15
Republican governors attending the National Governors Assn.
conference Monday that he's still considering a run for the
governorship of California. He mulled a challenge against California
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis last year, he said, but declined because
of his movie contracts.... "Donahue," MSNBC's new nightly series
hosted by veteran talk-show host Phil Donahue, drew about 1.1 million
viewers between 8 and 9 p.m. Monday, beating CNN's "Connie Chung
Tonight," with 801,000 viewers. Fox News Channel's "The O'Reilly
Factor," with 2,329,000 viewers, beat out both shows combined....
"Topdog/Underdog," the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Suzan-Lori
Parks, starring Jeffrey Wright and rapper Mos Def, will end its
Broadway run on Aug. 11.... Jim Carrey and Garry Shandling will make
their feature animation debuts doing voice-overs for DreamWorks'
"Over the Hedge," based on the popular comic strip.... Columbia
TriStar Home Entertainment will release "Spider-Man" on video and DVD
on Nov. 1.</TE>

<HD>'California Biennial' Is on the Right Laugh Track</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laughter comes in all shapes and sizes, and you don't need to be a
rocket scientist to know the difference between nervous titters,
polite ha-has and gleeful giggles. The same goes for the "2002
California Biennial" at the Orange County Museum of Art in Newport
Beach, where slapstick, parody and comic relief compete for your
attention.</LD>
<LD>   If this user-friendly exhibition, organized by curators Elizabeth
Armstrong and Irene Hofmann, had a subtitle, it would be "Gags,
Pranks and Jokes."</LD>
<LD>   Its 12 artists use humor to make works whose first priority is to
amuse you. A few paintings, sculptures and photographs go further,
transforming seemingly mindless entertainment into occasions for
sustained contemplation.</LD>
<TE>   Charlie White's big color photographs resemble stills from teen
movies. In several, well-heeled suburbanites fondle grotesque lumps
of flesh in the same way that children cling to ratty security
blankets. In others, anxieties about adolescent sexuality and
insecurities about fitting into one's peer group take the shape of a
scrawny, potbellied alien with leathery skin and puppy-dog eyes.
Experiencing more than his share of emotional misadventures, this
sympathetic misfit makes normal suburban life look freakish and
inhuman.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Sola's three 90-second videos have the presence of previews
for upcoming features made by a film librarian with a short attention
span and a love of order for its own sake. The first two consist of
snippets of scenes from popular movies in which characters recite the
same line: "Come on, come on" or "Go, go, go." The third, "Climaxes,"
shows 36 explosions, each from a movie made in the 36 years since
1966, when Sola was born.</TE>
<TE>   Tom LaDuke's sculptures evoke the painstaking detail of model-size
sets and the obsessive perfectionism of animatronic props. In one,
hundreds of doll-size clay figures portray the artist as if he were
the sole occupant of a mass grave. In another, two compact dioramas
support tiny electrical towers with microscopically thin wires that
extend across the gallery. LaDuke's nearly monochrome paintings
depict similar structures at their bottom edges. Fascinating at
first, his labor-intensive works are the artistic equivalent of
special effects: Their mind-blowing illusions provide welcome
diversions that fade from memory as soon as one leaves the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Three artists from San Francisco play games whose amusements wear
thin even more quickly. Yoram Wolberger has enlarged cheap toys so
that they stand face to face with adults. His plastic soldier, farm
girl with four chickens and bride and groom from a wedding cake are
too silly to convey much more than misguided ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Bollinger's 90-minute dual video projection and related
prints juxtapose hundreds of thumb-size images. Although both strive
to make a virtue of channel surfing, or to turn information
downloaded from the Internet into a compositional device, their
randomness has more to do with filling up space and killing time than
pursuing a compelling inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Syjuco's fake surveillance system, made of cardboard,
contact paper and blinking LED lights, also mimics the real thing.
Reminding visitors to be on guard against a false sense of security,
it is redundant and condescending.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles artist Kristin Calabrese wears her mistrust of
viewers--and images--on her sleeve. Her painting of a water-damaged
kitchen and three drip-enhanced silk-screens of generic street scenes
include so many "secret" messages written on their slapdash surfaces
that there's no room for mystery or for imagination.</TE>
<TE>   More playful self-referential mirroring seems to be the point of
Roman de Salvo's inflatable sculpture, which is meant to be tethered
to the stack of rocks it resembles in the museum's sculpture garden.
But technical difficulties have temporarily grounded his giant
balloon, which the San Diego-based artist calls a sculpture that's
also an advertisement for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Yoshua Okon uses humor to terrifically subversive ends. The best
of his four works is "Parking Lotus," a mockumentary project that
records his founding of the Los Angeles Security Guard Meditation
Movement.</TE>
<TE>   An unbelievably sincere mission statement accompanies eight
photographs of security guards meditating outside the institutions
where they work for low wages. Together, the text and images make
sidesplitting fun of the idea that art provides substitute social
services.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Okon playfully ridicules yoga yuppies. Never
making fun of the guards, he turns them into temporary works of art,
formally composed figures at once inscrutable, irresistible and
loaded with meaning, much of which is contradictory. It's impossible
to dismiss his project because it just might be serious. Not knowing
for sure is part of the pointed fun.</TE>
<TE>   Like Okon, the remaining three artists use humor as a point of
departure. Their works are funny only because they begin with such
dumb ideas that you can't help but snicker--at first. The longer you
look, the more your snide, self-satisfied smirks give way to delight.</TE>
<TE>   In four photographs that depict a dancer behind a semitranslucent
wood screen, Kelly Nipper discovers high-tech effects in simple,
mid-century designs. Her partially blocked views of a graceful woman
in an elaborately patterned blouse transform the look of digital
imagery in an astonishingly sensuous series in which time seems to
circle back on itself.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Chris Finley's paintings and Evan Holloway's sculptures
rearrange familiar objects to form fascinating conundrums you can't
get enough of. Designed with readily available software, the images
in Finley's billboard-scale paintings make computer (and emotional)
meltdowns look sexy.</TE>
<TE>   Holloway specializes in turning the world upside-down, over and
over again. The ghost of surrealism--or of a magician's stage
tricks--haunts his "Upsidedown White Rauschenberg," a boxy sculpture
that resembles a voting booth with a gravity-defying chicken walking
on its ceiling. In a black-and-white work, a life-size Styrofoam
version of Kurt Cobain stares into an architectural rendering of the
void. A third, titled "Black to Purple," consists of a small tree's
limb that Holloway has cut apart and glued back together so that
every branch forms a 90-degree angle.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks fly between Finley's garish paintings and Holloway's
subdued structures, making this gallery the highlight of the show and
one of the most intelligently installed museum spaces in recent
memory. The pleasures of levity may be fleeting, but sometimes
they're also unforgettable.</TE>

<HD>A Good Excuse for Buggin' Out</HD>
<DH>'Eight Legged Freaks' is an agreeable blend of terror,
schlock and ickiness</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've fixed the air conditioner for the seventh time this week. (And
it's only Wednesday!) You've played fetch with the dog, catch with
the kids, "Truth or Consequences" with your spouse. You're aiming
higher in your summer reading this year. But your eyeballs complain
about being buggy-whipped through the first 300 pages of "Bleak
House."</LD>
<LD>   I know what you're thinking: "Man, I could use me a good giant bug
movie just about now!"</LD>
<LD>   Couldn't we all? But let's face it. This isn't the 1950s when
James Arness and James Whitmore were all that stood in the way of
giant ants ripping up L.A. You used to be able to giggle and hoot at
the lame dialogue and absurd behavior like the guys on the late,
lamented "Mystery Science Theater 3000."</LD>
<TE>   Now these movies do all the giggling and hooting from within,
playing up the smarminess and camp until the irony squeals like a
smashed cell phone in mid-ring. Postmodern horror movies such as the
"Scream" series have been so hip to their own jive for so long now
that even the self-mockery feels as quaint as whatever is being
mocked in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   So why, then, does "Eight Legged Freaks" make one laugh out loud
even though there is nothing revolutionary about its approach to the
giant bug genre? Maybe it's because, as with "Scooby-Doo," "Charlie's
Angels" and other campy products of young Hollywood, the movie is so
unapologetic in its crassness that it disarms even the fussiest
connoisseur of throwaway disaster flicks.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, David Arquette, veteran of "Scream," "See Spot Run" and
other horror films, is in the lead. You can always count on many
well-earned laughs at his expense. Here, he's playing Chris
McConnell, prodigal son of a dead gold-mining baron who's coming back
to a nowhere desert town to claim his father's mine. He's also trying
to reconnect with the town's tough but sexy sheriff, Sam Parker (Kari
Wuhrer), whose rebellious daughter, Ashley (Scarlett Johansson), is
making out with the dopey son (Matt Czuchry) of the town's corrupt
mayor (Leon Rippy).</TE>
<TE>   All this soap opera stuff is quickly waylaid when a barrel of
toxic waste falls in a pond, affecting the DNA of bugs used as food
for a private collection of exotic spiders who grow as big as Phantom
jets. Sam's bespectacled son, Mike (Scott Terra), is the only one in
town who sees the danger. "They never listen to the kid," Mike
grumbles. Several living things are snatched, sucked and engorged
before everyone gets wise.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand director Ellory Elkayem is properly freewheeling with
the sight gags and B-movie glaze. The dialogue isn't quite as smart
as the visuals, and Doug E. Doug only narrowly avoids embarrassment
as the town's official paranoid radio jock. Never mind. "Eight Legged
Freaks" fulfills your giant bug movie needs with an agreeable blend
of shtick and stickiness.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for sci-fi violence, brief sexuality and
language. Times guidelines: icky, mildly gory scenes, some
vulgarities.</TE>

<HD>In Film, a Flair for Restraint</HD>
<DH>Jacques Audiard's personal style nears over-the-top, but
his movies embrace simplicity.</DH>

<LD>In his native France, Jacques Audiard, the director of a
thriller-cum-love-story genre-bender called "Read My Lips" that opens
in Los Angeles on Friday, is thought an elegantly cerebral artist.</LD>
<LD>   But if his films--a series of exercises in subtlety--excel at
self-restraint, in person Audiard doesn't. During a recent interview,
he wore a silk scarf, smoked a pipe and piled on adjectives with
Gallic aplomb.</LD>
<LD>   "It's truly gratifying to see my films reach beyond a familiar
public, to get a chance to move new audiences. It's nuts. It's
extraordinary," he enthused in his native tongue last week, as he sat
in a West Hollywood cafe taking alternate sips of espresso and water.
("I find the water better than the coffee," he announced.)</LD>
<TE>   Audiard, who at 50 still looks a bit like the graduate students
seen hanging out on Paris' Left Bank, was in town for a screening of
his three films--Audiard works at a very deliberate pace--at the
Egyptian Theatre over the weekend. "Read My Lips," which opened in
New York earlier this month, was praised by the New York Times for
its "many surprising satisfactions" and called "serious and rather
audacious" by the New Yorker. In France, Audiard's coolly detached
directorial style has earned him comparisons to Hitchcock.</TE>
<TE>   On this side of the Atlantic, the film is a far cry from recent
French exports, for the most part souffle-light comedies like
"Amelie" or kinetic romps like "Brotherhood of the Wolf"--movies that
have been easily digested by American audiences. "Read My Lips," with
its intellectually engaging narrative, seems to have less commercial
appeal; unlike "Amelie" it was not a huge mainstream hit in France.</TE>
<TE>   That does not bother Audiard, who said that his job is simply to
make movies and that he is not greatly preoccupied with what happens
to them afterward. But, he observed wryly, "this film has brought
greater joys to me than to its producer."</TE>
<TE>   The movie contains elements of film noir, thriller and dark
comedy, and it defies easy categorization. At its center are the
umbilical-cord ties between two unlikely partners that flourish into
a peculiar kind of love.</TE>
<TE>   "With 'Read My Lips,' I wanted to make a film in which two people
experience a love story, but not in the way we're used to seeing
it--a woman meets a man, they kiss, they sleep with each other,"
explained Audiard. "Here, there is a purity in their relationship."
The would-be lovers are Carla, a hearing-impaired secretary who works
in a claustrophobic Parisian office, and Paul, the thuggishly
handsome ex-con she hires on as a temporary worker.</TE>
<TE>   By day they hum along as worker bees in the corporate compound; by
night they turn partners in crime, in a plot that effectively weaves
in Carla's lip-reading skill. As the two become entangled in
ever-graver transgressions, their relationship grows stronger.</TE>
<TE>   While the film has the tug of a classic thriller, the director
insisted that the underlying theme is one woman's journey, as she
learns to succumb to love. "Carla's objective is to be loved," said
Audiard. "She finds this young man who is brutal, dumb, awkward, and
she educates him to become a good lover, someone in whose arms she
can surrender herself."</TE>
<TE>   In "Read My Lips," emotion has a reined-in quality; it seems to
course through the picture at a subterranean level. The erotic
attraction between Carla and Paul is played out in strange, small
gestures: She brushes his discarded shirt against her cheek and hugs
his sleeping bag. Audiard is fascinated by this kind of offbeat
relationship. In his 1994 debut movie "Watch Them Fall,"  he told the
story of two con men tangled up in a similarly peculiar partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "What I was interested in when I was making 'Watch Them Fall' was
this kind of strange relationship, which has died in cinema," said
Audiard. He was referring to the kind of ties that he feels were once
at the core of the Western genre--"friendly relationships between men
that are very singular, strongly sexual, like the one between Dean
Martin and John Wayne in 'Rio Bravo.' " A rabid filmgoer, Audiard is
particularly a fan of old Hollywood pictures and American directors
from the '30s, like Howard Hawks and John Ford. "I have a passion for
John Huston," said the French filmmaker. "I cry every time I see 'Fat
City.' John Huston was an old man when he made it, but it's a film of
adolescence. It has the spirit of an 18-year-old."</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriting has been Audiard's favorite craft, although now that
he also directs, he is not so sure anymore. "I used to find in
writing the most intense excitement, almost like sexual pleasure," he
said. His father, Michel Audiard, was one of the most celebrated
screenwriters working in France in the '50s and '60s, but Audiard
resisted the urge to follow in his footsteps. He concentrated instead
on the study of philosophy and only came to movies in his early 30s.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was young, I loved the movies and I had a great
relationship with my father, but I just saw myself differently. I
thought I would become an austere university professor. I wasted a
lot of time." But he has no regrets for the detour because, he said,
"It's very important to do other things besides film." He explained
that the literary and analytical muscles he flexed early on bore a
positive impact on his later work. "The cinema, as literature, as all
the plastic arts, do not exist outside of a critical system that
allows us to study them."</TE>
<TE>   For Audiard, the filmmaking process is enveloped in multiple
layers of thought. But at the same time the result is simple: The
dialogue is matter-of-fact and natural. There are no fancy words, no
symbolism. The visuals are stark. "Read My Lips" mixes a
slice-of-life aesthetic with the stylized feel of silent pictures. On
screen, images grow from tight luminous spots--close-ups of ears,
fingers, lips--and slowly widen to reveal a larger context. It feels
as if the heroine, freed from the incessant flow of sounds and
noises, can more intently focus on the details of life.</TE>
<TE>   "With Carla, who's deaf, it's interesting to see how she perceives
the world differently--what she perceives and what she doesn't
perceive," explained Audiard, who allowed that he was inspired by the
resourceful camera work of silent movies. "There's an irony there:
The movies are silent, the protagonist is deaf...."</TE>
<TE>   To convey Carla's condition, the film layers sound in rich
textures. Some are sharper than normal--the noise of a car's engine
cooling off in the parking lot is picked up and played up to
underscore the suspense leading to an act of robbery; the telephone
rings with unusual shrillness. Other noises are dulled, as the
protagonist removes her hearing aid.</TE>
<TE>   In allowing such precise details to define his protagonist's
fictional environment, Audiard revealed that he was inspired by David
Lynch's response to a question he once asked him--why make movies
altogether? The American filmmaker replied, "To create a universe and
see whether it can function."</TE>
<TE>   "I find this phrase radiant," Audiard said. "I want to do the same
thing."</TE>

<HD>'Big Brother': House Rules Change</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oh, brother. Things are getting more complicated on "Big Brother 3,"
but not necessarily more captivating. That depends on your taste for
this brand of chicanery.</LD>
<LD>   Just when the 12 house guests had set their strategies in motion,
forming alliances aimed at getting them to the half-million-dollar
prize, the producers introduced a sneaky twist of their own near the
end of the first week: veto power. How this affects the summer-long
battle royal will become apparent as Week 2 starts tonight (at 9 on
CBS; three new episodes run each week, on Wednesdays, Thursdays and
Saturdays).</LD>
<LD>   The object of the contest, of course, is to be the last one left
in the house by surviving each eviction vote--or, at least, to catch
the eye of a good agent along the way.</LD>
<TE>   To recap the first week: The guests moved in and started scheming.
Josh, the annoying waiter, targeted Marcellas for eviction because of
his "negative energy." Danielle and Gerry assumed the makeshift
family's mom and dad roles, trying to win friends and influence
roommates by performing chores. Lisa, the brash bartender, won the
first "head of household" competition, so she got to relax in a
private room and nominate two suckers for eviction. Most of the
others took the ol' sitting-in-the-back-of-the-classroom approach.</TE>
<TE>   Too much information was the theme of the second episode, as we
found out for sure that fashion stylist Marcellas is gay and learned
that videographer Jason is a virgin, which made him more adorable to
the women. Lisa put Marcellas and Lori on the chopping block.</TE>
<TE>   Amid politicking for the first eviction vote, the veto challenge
wrinkle stunned the contestants. Now the winner, Gerry, the
middle-aged teacher, can save Marcellas or Lori.</TE>
<TE>   As for tonight, there's a chance that Lori, the bank rep who last
week surmised, "I believe there might be a lot of backstabbers in the
house," will be proven right. After all, isn't that what it's all
about?</TE>

<LD>Baseball took center stage in prime time last week, though its
batting average was decidedly mixed, with strong ratings by cable
standards for ESPN's coverage of the "Home Run Derby" but record-low
viewing of the All-Star Game on Fox, based on viewing estimates
issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Even with a lower slugging percentage--sliding 9% below last
year--the All-Star Game topped all programs. Meanwhile, "Home Run
Derby" averaged 7.7 million viewers to lead cable fare, which would
have placed it No. 33 among programs on the broadcast networks last
week.</LD>
<LD>   CBS' "Big Brother 3," meanwhile, opened to a respectable audience
last Wednesday--beating Fox's "American Idol" in head-to-head
competition--then dropped sharply on Thursday and Saturday. Viewing
of the three-times-a-week unscripted series has tended to
fluctuate--especially on weekends.</LD>
<TE>   HBO's Robin Williams special and TNT's movie "Door to Door,"
starring William H. Macy, also attracted significant audiences
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   NBC cashed in with a Saturday telecast of "Men in Black"--timed to
the sequel's release--while ABC corralled its largest Monday night
movie summer audience in three years with "The Horse Whisperer."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rumor had it that the chief of a tribe in South America 500 years ago
was so rich he routinely powdered himself with gold dust. When word
of the chief's unusual taste in cosmetics reached Spanish explorers,
they dubbed him El Dorado--the Gilded One--and began a decades-long
quest for him and his precious yellow metal.</LD>
<LD>   The explorers never found the legendary figure, but his nickname
lives on to connote extraordinary wealth and luxury. In that vein, it
was chosen as the name for the finest model from General Motors
Corp.'s Cadillac brand.</LD>
<LD>   The Eldorado, as they misspell it in Lansing, Mich., arrived in
1953 as a "special sports convertible" weighing 4,799 pounds and
stretching 18 feet, 4 inches.</LD>
<TE>   Most Americans got their first glimpse of the bulbous-yet-sleek
glamour-mobile as it carried Dwight David Eisenhower to his
inauguration as 34th president of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   It has been 49 years since the Cadillac of all Cadillacs rolled
into showrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, some early Eldos have soared in price as collectors'
dream machines, other model years have proved themselves to be
reliable daily drivers, and most of the rest have earned deserved
reputations for shoddy engineering.</TE>
<TE>   With Cadillac ending the Eldorado line this year, prices for the
most desirable models are expected to climb.</TE>
<TE>   All Eldorados through 1955 were convertibles featuring a
wraparound windshield; a flush-fitting metal cover, or tonneau, that
concealed a folding cloth top; a sumptuous leather interior; elegant
chromed wire wheels; and white sidewall tires.</TE>
<TE>   Options included air conditioning and Autronic Eye, which
automatically dimmed the high beams at the approach of oncoming
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, Cadillac offered a hardtop Eldorado Seville coupe (3,900
made) and the Eldorado Biarritz convertible (2,150 made). Options
included a six-way power seat, a signal-seeking radio with
pre-selector and a gold-finish grille.</TE>
<TE>   All of the early Eldos featured tail fins, but the fins of the
'57s were especially eye-catching, thanks to 23-year-old design
engineer Ron Hill.</TE>
<TE>   By dramatically sloping the trunk lid, Hill--later chairman of the
transportation design department at Art Center College of Design in
Pasadena and now retired--accentuated the pointy tail fins to the
degree that they took on the menacing appearance of a shark dorsal
fin.</TE>
<TE>   More remarkable than either the finny '57 Biarritz or Seville was
the Eldorado Brougham, a new model that year. It was a handcrafted
hardtop sporting many industry firsts, including pillar-less
four-door body styling, an air suspension system, front seats with
electronic memory, quadruple headlights and air conditioning as a
standard feature.</TE>
<TE>   A mere 400 Broughams were built in 1957, fewer still in '58, '59
and '60, their last production year. At nearly the cost of a Biarritz
and Seville combined, the Brougham was attainable only by the
well-to-do. Original owners included Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra and
Elvis Presley.</TE>
<TE>   For 1958, the Eldo saw only minor changes, but the '59 models were
redesigned at the dawn of the Space Age and came out as stunners,
with long, low, sleek bodies that culminate in "Jaws"-size fins and
brake lights that resemble rocket engines. They were launched by a
390-cubic-inch V-8 engine generating 345 gross horsepower.</TE>
<TE>   All of the Biarritz convertibles from 1956 to '59 have become
collectibles, with models in working condition usually fetching
$20,000 to $35,000.</TE>
<TE>   Expect to pay $100,000-plus for a fully restored '53 Eldo. (The
originals--there were 532--cost $7,750 apiece, or about four times
the per-capita personal income in the U.S. back then.)</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for an immaculate '59, versus the $7,401 price tag
on each of that year's 2,295 Eldorados when they were new.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac began tempering the outlandish fins of its Eldorados in
1960 and did away with them altogether by the 1967 model year, which
also was when the Eldos forever switched from rear- to front-wheel
drive. Of the 1960s-era Eldos, the '60, '61 and '62 models are
becoming increasingly popular.</TE>
<TE>   "The most popular, of course, is the '59, but everybody has one
and I wanted a Cadillac that not everybody has," said Mike Lund of
Los Angeles, explaining his decision to buy a '61 Eldorado Biarritz
three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Lund, who also owns a 2000 Lexus RX 300, says the luxury sport
utility vehicle scarcely turns a head, whereas his topaz-colored,
ostrich-upholstered Biarritz is a major attention magnet.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had people follow me and pull me over and say, 'I want to
buy that car,' " Lund said the other day, shortly after a reporter
followed him and pulled him over to ask some car-related questions.
"I love it," he said of the attention.</TE>
<TE>   The downside to owning an early-model Eldo is the cost.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the purchase price, restoration can easily top
$15,000. Parts are pricey and often hard to come by. Fuel costs are
another factor--you can expect to get about 10 miles per gallon in
any early Eldo.</TE>
<TE>   Of the '60s-era models, the '68s and '69s made especially good
daily drivers, thanks to their trusty 472-cubic-inch V-8 engines.</TE>
<TE>   The Eldorados of the 1970s are notable for two reasons: First,
Cadillac replied to calls for more power to the people by fitting all
1970-75 models with 500-cubic-inch V-8 engines, the largest
passenger-car engine ever built for production and one of the most
bulletproof. And then the car maker equipped them with colossal
brakes and brawny transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   If you find a '70 to '75 with fewer than 100,000 miles and aren't
staggered by its fuel inefficiency, consider getting it as a daily
driver. Eldos of the early '70s run $2,500 to $5,000, with many
superb specimens available at the low end of the spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac offered a soft-top Eldorado in 1984, but the '76 was the
last of the classic Eldo droptops, and it has become quite popular. A
'76 Eldo ragtop usually lists for $12,000 fully restored, but
handsome low-mileage models occasionally can be found for as low as
$2,500.</TE>
<TE>   With only two exceptions, Eldorados made after 1976 cannot be
recommended.</TE>
<TE>   The '77 and '78 Eldos, though still sporting an elephantine
exterior, packed an unremarkable 425-cubic-inch V-8. In 1979 and '80,
the engine shrank further, to a mediocre displacement of 350 cubic
inches in '79 and 369 cubic inches the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac fitted the 1981 Eldorados with a "V-8-6-4," which,
through the magic of electronics, shut down either two or four
cylinders when acceleration was not needed.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was that the driver would enjoy the power of a V-8 with
the pedal to the metal and the better fuel efficiency a four-banger
could provide when cruising. Good idea, but poor engineering made it
a problem-plagued system, and Cadillac discontinued the variable
engine after only one year.</TE>
<TE>   (The concept recently was resurrected, with much better
engineering, on some of General Motors' pickups.)</TE>
<TE>   The 8-6-4 engine was replaced  with the HT4100 V-8, the letters
standing for "high technology" and the numbers for "4.1 liters" as
Caddy joined the rest of the domestic auto makers in dropping the old
cubic-inch displacement measurements for the metric system favored by
Asian and European auto companies.</TE>
<TE>   (Doesn't 4.1 liters sound better than the paltry 250 cubic inches
it represents?)</TE>
<TE>   The engine featured a cast-iron head atop an aluminum block (as
did the HT4500 that replaced it in '88). The HT might well have stood
for "highly troublesome." Quality control with other systems also
tanked. Buy an '80s-era Eldorado and you should expect problems with
power locks, power windows, power seats and so on.</TE>
<TE>   The '91 and '92 Eldorados, available in hardtop only, were the
line's only dependable models of the last quarter-century.</TE>
<TE>   Both featured a reliable 4.9-liter engine (299 cubic inches) that
produced a respectable 200 horsepower at 4,400 rpm. Fuel efficiencies
of 15 mpg city and 25 highway are the norm. A '91 or '92 Eldo
typically costs $3,000 to $5,000 for a solid car with fewer than
75,000 miles on the odometer.</TE>
<TE>   From 1993 to the present, the Eldorado has featured a 4.6-liter,
32-valve Northstar V-8 engine. It's made of aluminum and has two
major problems.</TE>
<TE>   First, it typically burns or leaks one quart of oil per 1,000
miles. Garages generally charge $2,400 to $3,000 to contain the oil
flow.</TE>
<TE>   The Northstar's second major flaw: The head bolts often strip out
of the aluminum block. This can occur when the engine has logged a
mere 50,000 miles. Cadillac should have recalled the engine. Instead,
its service centers often charge as much as $5,000 to fix this
particular problem.</TE>
<TE>   If Cadillac had continued to build Eldorados worthy of their name,
perhaps the model would be seen as the golden one among today's
luxury cars.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the last Eldo made--an alpine-white car destined for
Cadillac's museum--rolled off the assembly line in Lansing on April
22, the result of unmatched competition from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and
Lexus.</TE>

<HD>Nissan, Chrysler Announce Recalls</HD>
<DH>The safety administration notes that the Maxima, Infiniti
I30 and Q45, the Dodge Ram and the PT Cruiser are on the list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nissan Motor Co. has launched a recall of 161,000 late-model cars to
repair an electrical part that could cause a short-circuit and
possible fire, and Chrysler Group is recalling popular PT Cruisers to
fix a child seat anchor and diesel-powered Dodge Ram pickups to
repair a potentially faulty throttle part.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said a diode
used in alternators on the 1997 Nissan Maxima and Infiniti I30 and
Q45 sedans could have been damaged during production. If the diode
fails, it could create a short-circuit and possibly a fire.</LD>
<LD>   The safety agency said Chrysler will recall 97,000 of its 1997
Dodge Ram diesel pickups to fix a throttle part that can corrode and
stick, increasing the risk of a crash.</LD>
<TE>   Chrysler also will recall 77,000 of its 2001 model Chrysler PT
Cruisers to fix a child seat anchor that doesn't conform to NHTSA
standards.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth major recall already announced this month, Hyundai
Motor Co. said it will recall 34,000 Accent hatchbacks to reinforce
the passenger-side roof pillar, which failed to meet NHTSA's
standards for crashworthiness.</TE>
<TE>   Recall Reminder List</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that about 30% of motorists whose cars and trucks are
involved in recalls don't get the work done, the safety
administration each month issues a list of recalls originally
announced a few months earlier.</TE>
<TE>   This month's reminder list involves recalls launched in April and
includes:</TE>
<TE>   * DaimlerChrysler Corp.--2000-2002 model-year Jeep Wranglers, 2000
and '01 Jeep Cherokees and 1999-'02 Jeep Grand Cherokees, a total of
1,115,322 vehicles built from June 1998 to March 2002. The models,
all equipped with the 4.0-liter engine, have intake and exhaust
manifolds that can collect debris, creating a potential fire hazard.
Jeep dealers will install a manifold shield to prevent the
accumulation of debris. Owner notification began May 13.</TE>
<TE>   * Ford Motor Co.--Windstar minivans, 1995-1996 model years built
from January 1994 to May 1996; 250,283 vehicles are involved, and
none was sold or currently registered in California. Some have brake
lines that were twisted when installed and could come into contact
with and be abraded by the catalytic converter, wearing off corrosion
protection and potentially leading to brake-line failure. Dealers
will reposition uncorroded lines and replace those that show signs of
corrosion. Owner notification began May 10.</TE>
<TE>   * General Motors Corp.--2002 model Chevrolet Malibu sedans; 10,168
vehicles built in February. Some were built with a left low-beam
headlamp that does not meet federal standards. Dealers will inspect
the headlamp and replace it if it does not meet requirements. Owner
notification began May 23.</TE>
<TE>   * General Motors--2002 model-year Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC
Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada; 60,044 vehicles built from September to
November 2001. A fuel filter fitting can become disconnected, pumping
fuel onto the ground when the vehicle is being started or causing
engine failure while in operation. Also creates a fire hazard.
Dealers will replace the fuel filter's connection retainers. Owner
notification began May 20.</TE>
<TE>   * Hyundai Motor America -- 2001 model-year XG300, 1999-'01 Sonata;

<HD>Making Inroads Against Threat of Odometer Fraud</HD>
<DH>Better law enforcement and new technology may be helping to
reduce the crime. But was the size of the problem overblown?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When federal authorities obtained a guilty plea last year from
Khosrow Kohanchi for rolling back the mileage on used cars, it looked
like another case proving the serious and growing threat of odometer
fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Kohanchi was accused of importing cars to Los Angeles from
Baltimore, rolling back the odometers and bilking consumers. He was
sentenced to four months' incarceration and ordered to pay
restitution of $1.2 million, the largest amount for odometer fraud
since it was defined as a federal crime in the mid-1970s.</LD>
<LD>   But Kohanchi's case and the 15 or so others like it brought every
year by federal authorities may be something less than a reflection
of a widening consumer menace.</LD>
<TE>   A new federal study released last week shows that odometer fraud
is probably not nearly as large a problem as the public has been led
to believe during the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Transportation reported that 450,000 cases of
odometer fraud occur in the U.S. each year, costing consumers more
than $1 billion by putting a higher value on used vehicles than is
warranted by their actual histories.</TE>
<TE>   "Odometer fraud puts the safety and well-being of consumers at
risk because it misleads them about the wear and tear on the vehicle
they are buying," Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   But that seems to represent something of a rollback in our
perception of the crime. In the late 1980s, the federal government
warned that 1 million to 3 million cases of odometer fraud were
occurring each year, costing consumers $3.3 billion to $4.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Various reports by state agencies also have warned of a fairly
high threat.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Pennsylvania found that 5% of the odometers on leased
cars were rolled back before resale to consumers, based on a random
sample of 49,229 vehicles. The study estimated that vehicle buyers
spent an additional $6,653 on average, based on the false perception
of lower mileage.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois authorities sounded an even more dire warning in 1985,
estimating that 49.8% of leased vehicles had their odometers rolled
back.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the then-Chrysler Corp. admitted in the 1970s that it
had disconnected odometers on new cars while they were used by
executives, many consumers and experts have assumed that odometer
readings are next to worthless when buying a used vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say the lower figures in the recent report show
they are making inroads against odometer fraud through enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   A four-person odometer fraud swat team is run out of the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration under the supervision of
Richard Morse, the odometer fraud chief at the agency since the
mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to think our enforcement has had something to do
with it," Morse said, noting that the 1986 Truth in Mileage Act has
created additional consumer protections. Under the law, odometer
readings must be printed on a vehicle's title each time it is
transferred. Previously, the mileage was recorded on a separate
disclosure form that was difficult for buyers to track down.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicle technology is changing as well. Nearly every new car or
truck these days is equipped with a digital odometer, though Morse
insists that the new electronic dashboards are just as easily
manipulated as the older mechanical and cable-operated systems. The
new federal study makes no mention of digital odometers.</TE>
<TE>   Morse notes that a lot of odometer spoofing equipment is available
on the Internet, including popular auction sites. The systems
typically use special software and connections that plug a laptop
computer into a car's electrical harness, Morse said.</TE>
<TE>   Another important technology development is the use of secret
chips by manufacturers to record mileage in places other than the
odometer system.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler, now part of DaimlerChrysler, has been using such chips
the longest, though Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. also have
introduced them.</TE>
<TE>   Dealers can use them to prevent warranty fraud, though consumers
as yet have no way to access the data.</TE>
<TE>   Even if odometer fraud is less prevalent today, you can still get
ripped off and it still makes sense to take precautions when buying a
used vehicle. You should follow a few basic safeguards.</TE>
<TE>   First, always ask to see service records, which usually record the
odometer reading and date of service. That gives you a good idea of
the mileage profile of the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Consult one of the services on the Internet that can provide a
vehicle ownership history.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't want to pay, go to the California Bureau of
Automotive Repair's Web site at www.smogcheck.ca.gov and use its
database for examining the vehicle's smog-check history.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, have a mechanic examine the car or truck carefully to see
whether its condition is appropriate for the miles recorded on the
odometer.</TE>

<KH>Times Summer Camp Fund</KH>
<HD>Fifth-Graders Vote to Give the Gift of Camp</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>KWALA MANDEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plaque from this year's graduates of Franklin Elementary reads,
"Well done is better than well said." The quote from the school's
namesake, Benjamin Franklin, seems especially appropriate in light of
their actions.</LD>
<LD>   The fifth-grade class held a vote last spring to decide how they
would fulfill the graduating-class tradition of giving something
significant to the Santa Monica public school. Past commemorations
have included a trophy case, tiles and chairs. This year's options
were a new garden bench, a mural of Ben Franklin, or sending
underprivileged children to summer camp. The 150 students in the five
fifth-grade classes voted overwhelmingly to raise money to send
others to camp.</LD>
<LD>   "Ben Franklin is a cool guy and all, don't get me wrong," said
11-year-old Matthew Wizan of Santa Monica. "But we have a lot of
pictures of Ben Franklin in the office, so I chose the kids' camp
because I wanted to send someone who couldn't afford it to do
something fun."</LD>
<TE>   When the students began raising money, it was suggested that each
donate a dollar for every year he or she had attended Franklin. "At
first it was coming in slowly, trickling in, then there was this big
push at the end," said Leslie Wizan, PTA president. The grand total
was $750, enough to send five children to camp through The Times
summer camp campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Some students brought in a few dollars, others donated their
allowances that they had saved up for months. "I get $5 a week for my
allowance, and I saved a few of them," said Matthew. "I wanted to use
the money to get this video game called 'Star Wars Jedi Power
Battles,' but I decided to give the money to the class gift instead."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Katz, 10, said he also "was going to get a new Nintendo
game, but then I thought these kids maybe don't even have a
Nintendo."</TE>
<TE>   Video games aside, the graduating class does not want for much.
Franklin has many students who go to camps each summer.</TE>
<TE>   Michael is heading for tennis camp and then baseball camp. His
mother, Phyllis Katz, said, "The fact is that these kids are so lucky
to live in this community. But to have fifth-graders who can think
beyond themselves is extraordinary for a group of 10-year-olds," said
the Santa Monica homemaker.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be pretty cool if it starts a new tradition," said
Wizan. "It is better than garden benches."</TE>
<TE>   The plaque of the Franklin class of 2002 will hang in the school's
main office, but the class legacy will be in the memories of those
kids touched by the camp gift.</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp. This year more than
11,000 children will experience a special summer, thanks to the $1.6
million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6984. For more information, call
(213) 237-5771. To make credit card donations, visit www.latimes
.com/summercamp. Do not send cash.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax deductible. Unless donors request otherwise,
gifts of $25 or more are acknowledged in The Times. The summer camp
campaign is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the
McCormick Tribune Foundation.</TE>

<LD>I spend much of the morning with her at the fireplace store looking
at mantels. She browses. I follow her around like a mountain lion, 20
paces back.</LD>
<LD>   "Is there a special section here," I ask the fireplace guy, "for
really picky wives?"</LD>
<LD>   He laughs a little. The fireplace guy seems to understand wives
and the men who follow them around.</LD>
<TE>   "As you can tell, I pretty much pamper her," I tell him.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell," the fireplace guy says.</TE>
<TE>   As we leave, he gives me a barbecue scraper. Redwood handle. Brass
brush. The works.</TE>
<TE>   "See, it pays to treat people nice," I tell my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Know who's nice?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Me?"</TE>
<TE>   "Chuck's wife," she says. "I was talking to her at last night's
game." After the fireplace store, we head to the granite yard. There
is a protocol to buying granite. Much like heroin. "I think it's down
this street," my wife says as we cruise through North Hollywood.
Guard dogs smile at us through the chain link.</TE>
<TE>   The first granite yard, we don't like at all. The second one is
more promising, though I expect to be frisked at any moment. There's
a protocol to buying granite. I'm pretty sure the salesman is armed.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that gray slab," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "That's green," she says.</TE>
<TE>   This is the running argument of our marriage--that I'm colorblind
and she's not. It's her, of course. But I play along.</TE>
<TE>   "How about the tan one?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "That's blue," she says with a sigh.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the freeway, we spot a new Porsche. The 101 Freeway is
L.A.'s Porsche corridor. You can't drive it without spotting at least
six. "Hey, that's Matthew Perry," my wife says as a purple Boxster
zooms pass.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't joke," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone has little things that spook them. John Madden fears
flying. Billy Bob Thornton has an inordinate fear of antiques.</TE>
<TE>   For me, it's running into Matthew Perry somewhere--anywhere--and
hearing him spout his standard "Could it be any hotter in here?"
Unlike many phobias, mine seems perfectly reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "That's him," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "No, it isn't."</TE>
<TE>   "You passed our exit," she says.</TE>
<TE>   By now, it's late Saturday morning. I have a Radio Disney headache
and a cup of Starbucks perched by my knee. Radio Disney. It's
programmed into every button.</TE>
<TE>   As I leave the Starbucks, an employee behind the counter screams,
"Hey, does that cup say Anthony on it?" I know right then it's going
to be a special day.</TE>
<TE>   "No," I say, holding up my cup as proof.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not Anthony," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Right," I say.</TE>
<TE>   I guess I look like one of two things: Either the kind of guy who
steals coffee or someone who can't read his own name.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure," I holler back.</TE>
<TE>   So we flee Starbucks and continue out across Los Angeles, my wife
and I, this time looking for a bathroom vanity. It's for this
renovation we started seven years ago. In seven more years, we should
be nearly finished.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen lilies that color," my wife says as we enter the
humongous do-it-yourself store.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing great things with flowers," I say.</TE>
<TE>   We alternate between really expensive stores we can't afford and
bargain-basement warehouses with so much merchandise that they spill
out into the parking lots. Wheelbarrows. Hammocks. Lilies.</TE>
<TE>   At the humongous do-it-yourself store, the return-merchandise line
snakes out the door. Children play on the chrome turnstiles, blocking
customers from entering or leaving. Kids. Last I checked, the world
had enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate kids," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "You love kids," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "That was yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   Near the front door, there's a young woman dressed like a Hooters
girl. She's serving hot dogs to middle-aged guys buying peat moss and
garden hose.</TE>
<TE>   "And you, sir, a hot dog?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "This way," my wife says and leads me into the store.</TE>
<TE>   "You sir, a hot dog?" the Hooters girl asks someone else.</TE>
<TE>   We're looking for one item in a store with a million items, spread
out over an area roughly the size of France.</TE>
<TE>   This is what shopping in this country has become. A thousand-mile
trek. In America, there are no small stores left.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the do-it-yourself store has big signs over each
aisle to guide us:</TE>
<TE>   Aisle 1: Nothing you want.</TE>
<TE>   Aisle 2: Nothing you need.</TE>
<TE>   Aisle 3: Nothing that works.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our kind of place," I tell my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "The vanities are over here," she says.</TE>
<TE>   For some reason, there are only a few vanities. Some are in boxes
half-open and apparently gnawed upon by squirrels.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how they keep the prices so low," I explain.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go to that other store," she says. So we drive to yet
another store, which is much quieter and far too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "Could it be any hotter in here?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this place," says my wife.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, this store is a huge living room, where the sales
associates speak to you in hushed tones, muffled by carpets thick as
Kentucky bluegrass. Nice.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for landscape lighting," my wife explains.</TE>
<TE>   "We are?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "This way," the sales associate whispers.</TE>
<TE>   And for a while, we're falling in love again. Stores like this
inspire togetherness--even among married couples--till weeks later
when the bill arrives and the husband and wife blame each other for
overspending again. Till then, it's paradise.</TE>
<TE>   As we walk toward the landscape lighting, we spot a woman giving a
deep shoulder rub to a man studying carpet samples. Maybe that's why
the prices are so high. With every sale, you get foreplay.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, foreplay," I tell my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Huh?" she says, like she's never heard the term.</TE>
<TE>   "Foreplay," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "Those lights are over here," she says.</TE>

kidney damage or cause birth defects? A Washington, D.C.,
environmental advocacy group says yes. The chemical and cosmetics
industries say the group's claims are alarmist and unfounded.</LD>
<LD>   According to Not Too Pretty, a report released by Health Care
Without Harm last week, a number of everyday cosmetics contain toxic
chemicals called phthalates, a substance that is used to make
plastics more flexible and that is commonly found in beauty products.
Animal studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency and
other groups have linked the chemical to health problems and birth
defects.</LD>
<LD>   The Centers for Disease Control's National Report on Human
Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, released last year, found that
the type of phthalates used in cosmetics showed up in higher
concentrations in people than did phthalates used for other purposes.
In a 1999 sample study of 290 people of all ages, the CDC found that
some women between the ages of 20 and 40 had 20 times more Dibutyl--a
phthalate used in many beauty products--in their systems than the
average person, though the CDC doctors who performed the 1999 study
caution that the sample is too small to extrapolate conclusions for
the public.</LD>
<TE>   "We were really concerned about where on Earth these women could
be getting this exposure from," said Bryony Schwann, coordinator of
Coming Clean, one of three environmental advocacy groups that joined
forces for the Not Too Pretty study. "We started asking, what is it
about these women that they would be more exposed than the general
population? What do women between 20 and 40 do differently?"</TE>
<TE>   The coalition suspected the difference was their use of cosmetics.
Earlier this year, its members read 5,000 cosmetics labels looking
for phthalates. They knew they were used in various beauty products
from looking through government and chemical industry databases that
outlined phthalates' usage but couldn't find the chemicals listed on
most of the products, said Health Care Without Harm's executive
director, Charlotte Brody.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided we just had to spend some money doing testing," said
Brody, who spearheaded the research.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 72 top-selling, name-brand beauty products the group tested
at an independent laboratory in Chicago, 52 came back positive for
phthalates. Only one listed it on the label, Brody said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you pick up a cosmetics bottle, there's a list of chemicals.
Women don't have any idea what those chemicals do," Schwann said.
"How would they know about phthalates when they're not even labeled
on the bottle?</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big disconnect between the products we purchase in our
lives and how they're made," she added. "There's a great deal of
trust in the government and government agencies that it's their job
to monitor these chemicals and monitor industry to make sure the
public is protected, but [that isn't happening]."</TE>
<TE>   A number of industry groups say Health Care Without Harm is crying
wolf. Marian Stanley, senior director of the American Chemistry
Council and manager of its Phthalate Esters Panel, dismissed the
group's claims, calling them "another rehash of old theories and
guesswork" that "misuses government data" and "over-extends science."</TE>
<TE>   In response to Health Care Without Harm's citation of at least one
Procter &amp; Gamble product in its phthalates list, a spokeswoman said,
"All of our beauty care products, whether they contain phthalates or
not, are absolutely safe, and we're committed to ensuring their
safety."</TE>
<TE>   The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Assn. issued a statement on
its Web site in response to the study. "The use of phthalates in
cosmetics and personal care products is supported by an extensive
body of scientific research and data that confirms safety," it reads.
"Phthalates are widely used in many everyday products in modern
society."</TE>
<TE>   Phthalates are found not only in beauty products but in everything
from shower curtains to baby bottles and toys. The Consumer Product
Safety Commission, in 1998, asked toy makers to remove the chemicals
from baby rattles and teething toys, fearing they could leach from
soft vinyl toys into children's mouths. In 1999, the European Union
banned their use in some baby toys for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   Schwann said the problem isn't that the phthalates are used, but
their aggregate affect. "Say you use a hairspray with phthalates. The
company will say there's not enough in that hair spray to harm you,
but that isn't the only time you're exposed to [them]. You're exposed
through many other companies....It's the aggregate exposure that's
dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   "Surprised" by phthalate levels in their earlier studies, the CDC
is looking into the issue and will release an expanded, more detailed
report on human exposure in the fall, said Jim Pirkle, the CDC's
director of science for the environmental health lab that conducts
the studies. The study will break down phthalate levels by age, race,
ethnicity and gender and will be based on a survey of 2,500 people--a
large enough sample to extrapolate the results for the population at
large.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Health Care Without Harm plans to continue
lobbying the cosmetics industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of those products have phthalates and some don't," Schwann
said. "So they could clearly make these products without the use of
phthalates. We're not asking the industry to do an impossible thing
here."</TE>

<LD>There were three girls in the front seat of a car that passed me as I
headed home Sunday. It was 7 o'clock, and the summer evening sun had
gone golden, bright enough still to throw shadows, mellow enough to
look into without squinting. It shone through the windshield of the
car that passed me, illuminating the three girls in the front seat as
if they were in a movie. For an instant, I could see the shine of
their lip gloss, the comb marks in their still-wet hair, the nudge of
their breastbones beneath smooth tan skin.</LD>
<LD>   The one sitting on the passenger side was turned toward the
others, her arm around the neck of the girl in the middle. They were
laughing. The driver had both hands on the wheel, both eyes on the
road, but she was laughing too. For a moment, I wanted to be in that
car so badly, squashed in the seat with my friends, the smell of
shampoo and lip gloss and drugstore perfume rubbing against each
other like our sweaty hips and knees. Who knows where they were
going--the mall probably, or maybe out for pizza, but it didn't
really matter. The best part was the drive, being alone together in a
car on the way to somewhere else.</LD>
<LD>   For a moment, my stomach clenched in sudden longing, and then they
were gone, and I was on my way home again, wondering if the meat had
thawed and if there were any potatoes left.</LD>
<TE>   Teenagers in cars are usually not catalysts for sweet nostalgia.
In conversations--private and public, among adults--teenagers in cars
are, more often than not, the nexus of anxiety, irritation,
frustration and fear. Relieved as they might be at not having to
shuttle the whole soccer team around anymore, most parents surrender
the keys with one eye on the clock and cell phones set to ring and
vibrate.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, many policymakers have spent a lot of time worrying
about teenage drivers, adding new requirements and timetables to the
process of earning a driver's license. In some places, there are
curfews and restrictions on how many other teens can be in a car when
a teen is driving.</TE>
<TE>   And now there is a black box. For years, some emergency vehicles
have had installed a device that monitors and records the performance
of a driver based on speed, acceleration, braking, etc. And now
SafeForce, a Camarillo-based company that makes the box, has modified
the design--and its price--for public consumption.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, parents will be able to install a small black box that
will monitor seat-belt use, speed and tire traction. The recorded
information can then be retrieved at home with a memory card that can
download into home computers. And when a driver goes too fast, or
takes a turn too hard, the box will growl or beep in warning.</TE>
<TE>   Like squealing tires don't already do that.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, this will be a very popular item, and no doubt it will
make a lot of parents feel better and maybe even convince a few teens
to slow down before they're close enough to spit onto the stop sign.
The argument is that kids are simply inexperienced and don't realize
they're going too fast or taking turns too sharply. But the last time
I checked, most cars come with speedometers, and if you make that
left too suddenly, well, other drivers are only too willing to let
you know.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what you call it, this is a surveillance device, and
even in the post-Sept. 11 age, surveillance is always a little scary.
Will the box be turned off when the adults reassume the wheel? Is
that fair? The great majority of accidents do not involve teenagers
after all. Personally, I can't imagine willingly installing in my car
anything even capable of beeping or growling--with two toddlers, I've
got way too much noise going on as it is.</TE>
<TE>   The beeping and growling are also a bit troublesome. What with the
cell phones and pagers, most teens are strung with, how on Earth will
they know one beep from another? And growling? How weird is that?
Much more effective would be a recording of the parent conveying
alarm and anger. A burst of angry expletives, a sharp admonishment to
slow down using the child's own name would probably have a better
result (especially if there are other teens in the car). My mother
had a sudden intake of breath that pulled itself into a low keening
as she applied the phantom passenger-side brake that was particularly
effective. And very difficult to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Watching those girls flash by on a Sunday night, I remembered the
shivering thrill of burgeoning independence, when it was a gift not a
chore, when you knew you had to be careful because if you screwed up,
it would be taken from you. Maybe those girls wouldn't have shone as
bright if there had been a black box in their car, if they had to
turn in a memory card at the end of the evening and then sit while
their parents evaluated their driving mile by mile. Maybe.</TE>
<TE>   As a parent, I'm all for safer roads. But perhaps we should hold
off on the black boxes for a minute, wait until there is reason to
believe a teen is having a hard time understanding or obeying the
rules of the road. And then maybe instead of a recording, a real-live
grown-up should drive around with him or her for a while. Short of a
grizzly, no one growls more effectively than a grown-up who would
rather be somewhere else.</TE>

<LD>Wild About Reading</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Zoo is a popular place for authors, illustrators,
movie producers and screenwriters to do their research for
animal-related projects.</LD>
<LD>   They come to the zoo to observe how the zebras trot across their
exhibit. They want to make sure that the Asian elephants have five
toes on their forefeet and four on their back feet. They come to
sketch the fine lines that shape the faces of gorillas and even to
find the right shades of green on the Fiji Islands iguanas. When
these people come to the zoo, they are looking to make sure that
their stories, movies and illustrations are as close to the real
thing as possible.</LD>
<TE>   But sometimes writers use their imaginations to make the animals
come alive in their books. Did you ever hear the story of a ladybug
that was so lazy she tried to hitch rides with whatever animals came
her way? Or how about the story of the bear that snored through the
night while his friends had a party in his den? If not, you can have
these stories and more read to you this summer at the Los Angeles
Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its Go Wild About Summer program, the zoo is offering
storytelling by celebrities from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. every Saturday
and Sunday through Labor Day at the Go Wild About Reading Theater.
The books being featured this summer are "The Very Lazy Ladybug,"
"Papagayo," "The Salamander Room," "Bear Snores On" and "The
Long-Nosed Pig."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the zoo's literacy campaign, every child who visits the
zoo this summer will receive a Go Wild About Reading activity book
that has word games, important conservation messages, coloring pages
and pages for brass rubbings at five stations throughout the zoo. For
more information call (323) 644-6400 or visit www.lazoo.org.</TE>

<HD>Teen's New Book Sends Message: Labels Are for Clothes, Not
People</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAMANTHA CRITCHELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A label is flat, it has no depth and there is only room for one or
two not-so-helpful words. Yet this tool is not only used to describe
clothes but to put people in shallow categories.</LD>
<LD>   Teenagers are particularly tempted to label their peers, says
Aisha Muharrar, this year's valedictorian at Bay Shore High School on
New York's Long Island.</LD>
<LD>   "We're at an age when we're trying to find ourselves as
individuals but have to conform right away to what our friends are
doing. It can be confusing," she says.</LD>
<TE>   The 18-year-old challenges us all to look deeper than a shirt's
tag rubbing the back of one's neck in a new book, "More Than a Label:
Why What You Wear or Who You're With Doesn't Define Who You Are"
(Free Spirit).</TE>
<TE>   Muharrar based her book on a teen label survey she sent to 13- to
18-year-olds across the country. The questions mostly are about
cliques, and clothes are often the easiest way to identify the
different groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Clothes are a major factor in forming labels. They're based on
where you've seen the clothes before. You see clothes that look like
they're from a rap video, you label them a hip-hopper, and you say
they must be trouble," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Preps," whose wardrobe resembles a J.Crew catalog, are thought to
be fans of lacrosse and tennis and to come from "old money." They may
also be called "Abercrombies," referring to retailer Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch. There's also the issue of how much clothing one
wears--especially a girl if her midriff is bare and her skirts are
short, Muharrar says.</TE>
<TE>   The author, who will be a freshman at Harvard University in the
fall, acknowledges that labeling has become part of daily life and
"you're not a horrible person if a label comes to mind when you see
someone," but she encourages using simple logic to bust stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   "Not every person who wears the same clothes can be the same
person," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Take the plain, button-down white shirt as an example. According
to Muharrar, all-too-simplistic labels say if the shirt is worn with
khaki chinos, it signals a "prep"; if the rest of the outfit is
black, the wearer could be a "goth." But those super-preppy khaki
pants become a "hippie" style if worn rumpled with a protest shirt,
Muharrar says.</TE>
<TE>   "These 'rules' show how ridiculous the labels are," she adds.</TE>
<TE>   Muharrar describes her own style as a "jeans-and-T-shirt girl,"
but she also likes to wear skirts as an alternative to shorts during
the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Her mission to eliminate labels from teenagers' vocabulary started
in the eighth grade when Muharrar called a girl a "snob" while they
were both at camp.</TE>
<TE>   Muharrar went all summer without saying a single word to the
girl--until the last week. When they finally spoke, Muharrar says she
realized the girl wasn't a snob at all.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Columbine.</TE>
<TE>   When the shooters in the 1999 tragedy at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., were called the "trench-coat mafia" because of
their goth-style clothes, Muharrar took offense.</TE>
<TE>   The clothes these troubled teens wore weren't dangerous, she says,
but teasing--which can turn into slurs--can contribute to the larger
problem of teenage violence.</TE>
<TE>   Muharrar says she goes to great lengths not to use labels or judge
what kind of person someone is based solely on appearance.</TE>
<TE>   In her book, she offers 25 ways to follow her lead. Lesson No. 1:
"Smile or say hello to someone new every day. You'll be surprised at
how easy it is and what it might lead to--new friends, for instance."</TE>

<LD>That evening Annette put Cherry Eyes in his cage after they had
played together. Cherry Eyes' cage was in her room, and he had his
supper of grain pellets. Then he reached up and took a long drink
from his bottle.</LD>
<LD>   Annette watched the bubbles rise up to the top as he gulped. Then
he sat back and licked his hand-like paws, rubbed his face and
groomed his fur like a cat. It was more fun to watch than television!</LD>
<LD>   After doing her homework Annette went to bed and turned out the
light.</LD>
<TE>   She was almost asleep when she heard a rhythmic sound;
"Eee-Eee-Eee...."</TE>
<TE>   Cherry Eyes was running on his exercise wheel, stretching his
little 3-inch body out in great leaps. He seemed to be having such
fun. It was probably good for him and kept him healthy.</TE>
<TE>   But it was hard for Annette to sleep with his squeaking wheel. He
will get tired in a while, Annette thought, and went back to bed. He
didn't get tired, but Annette got so tired that she finally fell
asleep.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning at breakfast, Annette told her family about her
sleepless night.</TE>
<TE>   "So that's what that squeaking sound was," said Tyler.</TE>
<TE>   "Mice are basically nocturnal animals," Dad said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nocturnal?" asked Tyler.</TE>
<TE>   "It means night. They like to run around and do things at night,"
said Annette.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the squeaking can be fixed with a couple drops of oil,"
Dad said as he poured another cup of coffee. "Remind me tonight,
honey."</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks, Dad." Annette got up and went to get her schoolbooks.</TE>
<TE>   The bedroom door was open and Sammy was standing on her desk next
to Cherry Eyes' cage. His head was down low, staring through the
wires at the little mouse.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no! Sammy!" Annette grabbed the cat around the middle and
took him outside of the room and carefully closed the door behind
her.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Will Cherry Eyes be safe from Sammy?</TE>
<TE>   Mice are interesting animals. You can learn more about them at
your local library. This story will be on The Times' Web site at www.

<DH>'Trail angels' provide water, food, even lodging for hikers
on the Pacific Crest</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By his 454th mile, with the brutal Mojave Desert just ahead,
33-year-old hiker Daryl Waycott would not mind news of, say, a quick,
biblical kind of thunderstorm--which sounds farfetched, maybe, but
it's funny how wistful thinking can play out on the rugged Pacific
Crest Trail. This time, though, by the time Waycott hikes out of the
Angeles National Forest, there are no such glorious tidings of creeks
and springs that runneth over.</LD>
<LD>   This year, on the 2,650-mile PCT, the lack of rain--not to mention
the heat--is the talk of "through hikers" who are trying to complete
the entire route by September or so. On the Southern California part
of the rugged trail, which runs from Mexico to Canada, the
long-distance hikers are more vigilant than usual in the back country
and remote deserts, checking out mudholes, horse troughs, any
potential water source. On a hot day, even if you carry 10 pounds of
water--about 1 1/4 gallons--you can run perilously low. But just as
the worry begins to creep in, Waycott said, he somehow stumbles upon
the wondrous.</LD>
<TE>   All along the trail, he is discovering the work of what
long-distance hikers call trail angels, or volunteers who devote
themselves to providing help along the way. Trail angels, for
instance, figure out the spot at which hikers are likely to run into
trouble, such as a spring that is listed in a 2-year-old guidebook as
a water source--and then turns out to be dry. Unbidden and often
anonymously, the angels haul water to the most worrisome places on
the trail, up mountains and through deserts, restocking the
containers every few days for waves of hikers. (About 200 PCT
"through hikers" set out every year; 50 or 60 will finish.)</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, Waycott is taking a rest day at the
high-desert home of trail angels Donna and Jeff Saufley, near Santa
Clarita. Waycott, a software engineer from Bristol, England, had
heard about the angels from a friend who had hiked the PCT. But he
didn't understand their worth or anticipate a dry spell like this
one. From home, he had mailed a package full of supplies to the Lake
Hughes post office that could be held for him and picked up before he
hit the High Sierra. As it turns out, he won't be needing the ice ax,
crampons and other mountaineering gear, Waycott noted with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   Waycott, who is quiet and easygoing, set out on the trail in early
May, after flying to San Diego and making his way to Campo, a small
town near the Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature soared as Waycott headed north with a 25-pound
backpack past Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead. He stopped in shade
to rest. He waited for cloud cover before moving on. "I thought I was
going to have real problems, and then it was right there ... It's
amazing when you come across a trail and the cache is right where you
need it. You're almost out of water and suddenly there's 5 gallons of
water! Wow, someone has really thought about this and where to put
it."</TE>
<TE>   One by one, in no organized network, the angels have popped up
since the PCT was dedicated in 1993, said Joe Sobinovsky of the
Sacramento-based Pacific Crest Trail Assn. In dry seasons like this
one, the angels play a particularly important role, said Sobinovsky,
program director for the nonprofit group, which promotes and helps
maintain the trail. "If it weren't for some of these guys leaving
water, it would be a tough year," he said. "When they run across this
stuff, it's unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Angels are a tradition on long-distance footpaths such as the
2,167-mile Appalachian Trail, which runs from Maine to Georgia. On
that trail, through hikers help themselves to peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches that angels hide for them in trees.</TE>
<TE>   On the PCT's Southern California segments, no one knows who all
the angels are. Long-distance hikers either stumble across the
largess or hear about "caches" by word of mouth. Clues often point
the way to the hidden water. Rocks, for instance, are arranged to
spell out "H20" with an arrow in the dirt pointing to jugs of water
tied together with string.</TE>
<TE>   Near the southern beginning of the trail, angels named "Larry,
Larry and David," leave a homemade cabinet stocked with 30 or so
1-gallon jugs of water and a note inviting the hikers to help
themselves and have a seat--on chairs labeled "2002 PCT" that the
trio built.</TE>
<TE>   Just before hikers reach the western Mojave, they might hear about
the angels who provide a cooler stocked with soda, water and beer by
a creek. Near Palm Springs, two trail angels have set up a trailer
dubbed the "Pink Motel," which offers the backpackers fresh fruit,
bread, cold water and other free refreshments.</TE>
<TE>   Until they hit the Sierra Nevada, the hikers' days revolve around
the hunt for decent water that can be treated or filtered. Water
sources sometimes are 20 miles apart, which makes for tough going
when the temperature soars. Facing 20 to 30 miles a day on steep
trails, with backpacks weighing as much as 60 pounds, the hikers have
to decide how much water they want to add to the load. In early
reports to the PCT Assn., the outlook is grim: "The first ford of
Cottonwood Creek is dry.... There was a foot of yucky water in the
horse trough at Burnt Ranch.... The tank at Mason Valley Truck Trail
is empty.... There is absolutely no water, Trail Angel or otherwise,
on the San Felipe Hills...." And that was just the first 100 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Farther down the trail is the grueling 90-mile section through the
Mojave Desert, where Terrie and Joe Anderson have hidden five water
caches, along with a cooler full of surprises such as root beer and
pineapple-orange juice. The couple began evolving into trail angels
three years ago, after noticing the number of long-distance hikers
who came into their town for water.</TE>
<TE>   One night, Joe Anderson, 46, offered a ride to a hiker who was
making his way toward their small mountain community in northern Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Another night, Anderson, a set design worker on a TV show, invited
a group of hikers over for vegetable soup.</TE>
<TE>   The Andersons, who have three teenagers, kept meeting hikers and
hearing about the way that trail angels stepped into the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Anderson, who was an Eagle Scout, does a little hiking, but
his 38-year-old wife does not; the two learned from the hikers about
how hard it can be to track down treatable water in the Mojave. (The
hikers count on rain-fed springs or seeps--trickles of groundwater
forced to the surface--that aren't contaminated by the droppings of
burros or other animals). The Andersons, who didn't want hikers to
dread their approach to the desert, began hauling water to potential
trouble spots and offering to put hikers up for a night or two, meals
included.</TE>
<TE>   At the Saufleys' home in early June, Waycott and other hikers find
word of the Andersons' caches on a water report that is attached by a
clothespin to a chain-link gate. Donna Saufley, 45, tries to gauge
the water supply ahead and keep the report updated so hikers know
what to expect in the Mojave. A few days ago, she worried,
temperatures in the desert soared to 120 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   At least for a day or so, she and her husband can pamper the
hikers a bit before the road ahead. For the past six years, Donna and
Jeff Saufley have put up hikers in their two-bedroom guest house,
which includes a TV, air-conditioning, shower and living room with a
futon. (The Saufleys charge no fees but, because so many hikers
asked, they have a vase in which the guests can leave money).</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the satisfaction of helping a fellow human being," said
Donna Saufley, a technology consultant for mortgage lender Fannie
Mae. "You've made their journey better, and then you've been woven
into that journey." Hikers who later write to the Saufleys sometimes
tell them that their hospitality made the difference in the dark
moments when they wavered between quitting the trail or going on.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of us would say that it really gives you a renewed
faith in how good people can be," said 59-year-old hiker David Tabb,
who has dipped into a few water caches along the trail.</TE>
<TE>   You can't rely on the caches because they might be empty, Tabb
noted. But you can hope.</TE>
<TE>   In a day or so, he'll pass the Sierra Pelona mountains, heading
toward the base of the Tehachapi Mountains. There's almost no trees
or shade, and it's a long haul between potential water sources. And
the days are longer, and the sun is higher....</TE>

<HD>Lounge Wizards Find Intoxicating Pastime</HD>
<DH>Leisure* In televised trivia games, tavern and eatery
patrons match wits with rivals nationwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Wednesdays and Fridays, Kim Ludwig and her friends go to their
neighborhood bar, not to drink or even to flirt, but to show off
their formidable powers of recall. They go to play televised trivia
games. So committed are they to their sport that during the NBA
playoffs they begged the bartender to switch channels--even Shaq and
Kobe were no match for their favorite game on the bar TV.</LD>
<LD>   Their pastime of choice is besting thousands of other players at
as many as 3,600 bars and restaurants in the United States and Canada
by answering such questions as:</LD>
<LD>   "The Thar Desert is also known by this name: (1) Great Indian (2)
Death Valley (3) Empty Quarter (4) Great Sandy (5) Painted Desert."
(Correct answer: 1.)</LD>
<TE>   Ludwig and her friends are part of a community that relies on NTN
Network, a Carlsbad, Calif.-based company that produces and transmits
trivia programming. The network attracts 6 million players a year,
500,000 of them hard-core, according to 45-year-old Mark deGorter,
the network's president and chief operating officer. And 30,000 to
40,000 new players tune in every month.</TE>
<TE>   A real estate investor and former ostrich rancher who laughs
derisively when asked her age, Ludwig has been playing trivia at TGI
Friday's in Woodland Hills since May 1995. She was newly divorced,
she recalled, "and I decided I needed to get a life."</TE>
<TE>   Televised trivia gave her a legitimate reason for sitting at a
bar, striking up conversations with strangers who also knew which of
the following utensils are not used by cooks: "(1) zester (2) vitrine
(3) skimmer (4) colander (5) trussing needle." (Correct answer: 2, a
glass showcase for art objects or curios)</TE>
<TE>   When the Wednesday game begins at the stroke of 6, Ludwig and half
a dozen others are crammed together on one side of the square bar,
oblivious to the clamor and courtship going on around them. Their
eyes are fixed on the TV screen, their fingers hovering over the
buttons on their electronic answer boxes, or Playmakers, as NTN calls
them.</TE>
<TE>   The network transmits a different themed "premium game" each night
of the week, with specially tailored questions. Mondays feature
sports trivia; Saturdays, Spotlight, a show-biz trivia contest for
the date-night crowd. Games are broadcast live, and players compete
in real time against devotees from Maine to Florida, Vancouver to
Southern California. The highest individual scorers and top locations
are announced at the end of every game.</TE>
<TE>   The network produces and sends 15 hours of trivia programming a
day and is the world's largest out-of-home interactive television
network, according to DeGorter.</TE>
<TE>   So seductive is the pastime that players have been known to sneak
out of work early to play and have rescheduled their weddings rather
than miss a favorite game. DeGorter said that the FBI once subpoenaed
play records of a suspect whose alibi was that he was playing
televised trivia.</TE>
<TE>   "My best all-time score, I was ninth in the nation," Ludwig
recalled. She also remembers her most humiliating defeat, failing to
choose blueberry as the official muffin of her adopted home state of
Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "The game either brings out your spirit of camaraderie or it bring
out vicious competitiveness," said Ludwig, whose nom de trivia is
Cheers.</TE>
<TE>   At Friday's, play is intense, but bonhomie is the dominant
attitude. Bar trivia is a subculture unto itself, in which players
who avoid alcoholic beverages to stay sharp are known as "tea
sippers." Ludwig, who often nurses a Scotch and water or Captain
Morgan's rum and diet Coke as she plays, can drink and win at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   The handle Pegisu flashes on the TV screen, showing that lawyer
and mediator Peggy Sue McGinn has won the round at Friday's.</TE>
<TE>   "When people win here, the others do the wave, they clap or they
say, 'Way to go,' " said Ludwig. But bad losers happen.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen people storm out," Ludwig said. "I've seen people throw
things."</TE>
<TE>   Players begin by punching their "handles" into their answer boxes.
When a question appears on the screen, players have 20 seconds to
choose an answer.</TE>
<TE>   Speed counts. If you answer correctly in the first three seconds,
you get 1,000 points, fewer if you're slower.</TE>
<TE>   In the view of bar-entertainment analyst Kevin Seddon, televised
trivia is appealing because "people like to answer questions. They
like the competition. It's social and interactive, and you're able to
do it in a bar, while having a drink, so it satisfies a whole range
of social needs."</TE>
<TE>   NTN's operation is unusual in that it is played in a bar or
restaurant, unlike trivia games played on home computers, said
Seddon, 36.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike coin-operated trivia games, NTN broadcasts live and
doesn't charge players, said Seddon, whose Mississippi-based Oxford
Publishing produces Nightclub &amp; Bar, Restaurant Marketing and
Beverage Retailer magazines.</TE>
<TE>   The network justifies charging bars and restaurants $600 a month
by citing a 2000 study it commissioned from a Michigan marketing
research firm that found that players spend a median $35.50 per
visit, 47% more than nonplayers.</TE>
<TE>   Seddon said that both televised trivia and coin-operated games can
boost a bar or restaurant's traffic. The regulars always show up, and
the presence of competition attracts newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   "People will stand and watch," Seddon said. "They'll wait to play.
It really pulls them in, which is why the bars and restaurants love
[trivia games]."</TE>
<TE>   To make its trivia package more attractive, NTN offers its
longest, toughest general-knowledge game Tuesday, "the night the bars
and restaurants need business most," DeGorter said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday it broadcasts Showdown, a grueling 1 1/2-hour contest,
and the team at National Sports Grille in West Covina owns Tuesday
night, trivia-wise.</TE>
<TE>   NTN estimates that 55% to 65% of its players are male. The elite
West Covina squad--often the highest-ranked Showdown team in North
America--has some 10 men and one woman. For the most part, these are
people who did way better than you on their SATs: Two Harvard-trained
attorneys, three "Jeopardy" winners, a young married couple who met
on the thinking fields of Caltech.</TE>
<TE>   "We're one of West Covina's major tourist attractions," joked
player Richard Mason, a 30-year-old mechanical engineering student at
Caltech who has won Ben Stein's money.</TE>
<TE>   The National Sports Grille players are what some in the trivia
community deride as a "borg team," one with an almost robotic drive
to win. Players use multiple-answer boxes, and they sometimes look
answers up on a laptop computer.</TE>
<TE>   "We get a lot of grief because we use the computer," said West
Covina's Barry Anton, a retired attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Other winning teams consult reference books, Anton pointed out.
All his team did was to discover a superior weapon that helps it win
fair and square: "Instead of the crossbow, we used the gun."</TE>
<TE>   The West Covina team loves trivia but is sometimes piqued with
NTN. Players make bitter jokes about losing money on the stock of NTN
Communications, the network's parent company. The firm has lost money
for the last seven years, but its financial picture is improving,
DeGorter said. It recently launched a trivia cable channel in
Pennsylvania, and its bar trivia business made a profit for the last
two quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Some longtime players also grouse about the lack of any reward but
the occasional cheap trophy and the network-wide announcement of
"Brain of the Day."</TE>
<TE>   Maureen Pflum, director of marketing research, said that avid
players will play no matter what: "They're addicted." But the network
recently completed preliminary rounds of a game with a possible
$1-million payoff, and it has started giving top players certificates
for discounts on food and drink, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Pflum rattles off player demographics--median age, 33; median
income, $70,000. But what she really enjoys is plumbing the

play patterns and how televised trivia fits into their lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   A regular player of Showdown, Pflum collects examples of the
player community's distinctive language, lore and rituals. Players
who don't share answers are called "sandbaggers." Some players regard
as an article of faith "the rule of three"--if you're not sure of the
correct answer, press 3 and you'll probably be right. Top scorers
often seek each other out when they visit new cities.</TE>

<HD>Cold Comfort in Summer</HD>
<DH>The season's temperatures drive some indoors to a Burbank
rink, where the ice is oh so nice</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CINDY CHANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With summer in full swing, the 30-second walk from the parking lot
onto the ice of the Pickwick Ice Center in Burbank is a trek through
distinct climate zones. Outside, the asphalt radiates the collected
heat of the day; the impulse is to tear the clothes from your body,
anything for relief. Step inside the lobby and soon a small "aaahhhh"
escapes your lips. The oppressive heat outside fades from memory as
the air-conditioning blows a gentle chill across your skin. Your
midsummer garb now is perfectly comfortable.</LD>
<LD>   But push through the double doors and into the rink's icy inner
sanctum, and you're suddenly thrust into winter, rummaging
frantically in your bag for a sweater.</LD>
<LD>   Here, it's a different world, a world of mittens and fleece
pullovers in July, graceful little girls leaping and spinning, the
shush-shush of metal blade against ice. A man in a blue warmup suit,
a fisherman's hat and thick gray gloves does slow-motion hops and
twirls, never straying far from the middle of the rink, as other
skaters swirl around him.</LD>
<TE>   Small children cling to the walls, painstakingly inching a path
around the rink. Andrea Baly of North Hollywood looked on fondly as
her 4-year-old son, Zachary, made his way around, usually steady on
his feet save for the occasional rear-bruising tumble. "It's one of
our favorite summertime activities," Baly said. "All the children
love it."</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Kang, a fourth-grader who came to the rink with a summer
school group from Koreatown, skated confidently if not quite
gracefully. She said that she had never ice skated before but she
picked it up pretty easily. "It's a lot like roller-blading," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Waite and Irina Popov, street-hip teens in tees and tight
jeans, are counselors at a nearby equestrian camp. They come to the
rink to cool off and play the arcade games that line the wall next to
the snack bar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hot outside, so it feels good to be cold," Waite
said.</TE>
<TE>   "At 10:30 in the morning, it's already 100 degrees out. I come
here to cool off," said Danielle Ronceros, a senior at Reseda High
School in Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   For others, the rink is a constant in their lives, no matter the
weather outside. Rachelle Bricker, a 74-year-old retired aesthetician
from Burbank, has skated here Mondays and Fridays since 1963. "I have
air-conditioning at home, so it's more about the exercise and seeing
friends," said Bricker, who cuts a distinct figure on the ice in a
fuchsia warmup suit with matching hair tie and earrings.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people consider [ice skating] a winter sport. There aren't
the hordes you would expect [during the summer] ... but it's a great
way to beat the heat," said Sean Bachand, the rink's assistant
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Though a world apart from the sunbaked asphalt outside, the rink
is not devoid of personal ambition. The mother of a ponytailed young
girl demonstrated the "right" way to jump, with vehement gestures and
commentary. The girl listened expressionlessly, nodded, then glided
onto the ice to try yet again.</TE>

<LD>Here are cookies you can eat without feeling too guilty. That's
because they're small--not to mention irresistible. They pair
wonderfully with summer fruit, as well as sorbets and ice creams.</LD>
<LD>   Start with the "Peanutters" and Coconut Toffee Crisps, light,
delicate cookies. Then bake a batch of your favorite brownies and cut
them into small bites. Group all three on a platter for a nice and
easy presentation.</LD>
<LD>   You can also pack them up for picnics or potlucks, or give them as
gifts, attractively packaged in cellophane bags, tied at the top with
raffia.</LD>
<TE>   Each recipe makes enough cookies, too, to compensate for those who
won't be able to eat just one or two.</TE>
<TE>   And if small is not for you, you can always make the crisps and
peanut cookies bigger and cut the brownies larger. No one will ever
know.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Peanutters'</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened</TE>
<TE>   1 egg white</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon baking soda</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Lightly salted roasted peanut halves, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Set aside 2 ungreased baking sheets.</TE>
<TE>   Use a mixer to cream the granulated and brown sugars and butter.
Add the egg white and vanilla; mix well. Add the peanut butter; mix
until smooth. Use a wooden spoon to stir in the flour, baking soda
and salt; mix just until the flour disappears. Do not overmix.</TE>
<TE>   Use a pastry bag fitted with a 1/3-inch wide tip to pipe out
1-inch diameter rounds, spacing them 2 inches apart, on the baking
sheets. Alternately, use 1 teaspoon of batter for each cookie. Top
each with a peanut half.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until set and just slightly browned, about 7 to 8 minutes.
Let the cookies rest 3 minutes, then use a metal spatula to transfer
them to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight
container for several days at room temperature or freeze up to 1
month, wrapped airtight.</TE>
<TE>   50 cookies. Each cookie: 44 calories; 29 mg sodium; 2 mg
cholesterol; 3 grams fat; 1 gram saturated fat; 5 grams
carbohydrates; 1 gram protein; 0.22 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coconut Toffee Crisps</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon ground ginger</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup dark corn syrup</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons dark rum</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1 cup plus 2 tablespoons cake flour</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup sweetened flaked coconut</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons powdered sugar</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Line several baking sheets with
parchment paper and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Use a mixer to cream the butter, sugar, cinnamon and ginger. Add
the syrup, rum and vanilla. Mix until smooth. Use a wooden spoon to
stir in the cake flour, coconut and salt.</TE>
<TE>   Use 1/2 teaspoon of batter for each cookie and drop onto the
parchment paper, spacing 3 inches apart. Use your palm or the back of
a spoon to slightly flatten.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the cookies until lightly browned, about 17 minutes. Let rest
5 minutes. Use a metal spatula to transfer them onto paper towels to
cool completely. Once cooled, store up to 5 days in an airtight
container, at room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   To serve, press a light sprinkling of powdered sugar through a
fine sieve evenly over the surface of the cookies.</TE>
<TE>   About 60 (1 1/2-inch) crisps. Each crisp: 42 calories; 9 mg
sodium; 4 mg cholesterol; 2 grams fat; 1 gram saturated fat; 6 grams
carbohydrates; 0 protein; 0.10 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Variation:  Make "cigarette-shaped" cookies by rolling them as
soon as they come out of the oven. Bake only one sheet of cookies at
a time. As soon as the sheet is out of the oven, use a small offset
spatula to roll each warm cookie over the handle of a wooden spoon.
If some cookies harden before you roll them, return them to the oven
for several seconds until pliable.</TE>

<HD>A Touch of the Exotic Comes to Torrance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two Torrance farmers markets, on Tuesdays and Saturdays, are
among the largest in the Southland. Each offers about 50 produce
vendors--many of whom sell at both markets. Tuesday's affair attracts
lots of seniors and moms with strollers, while Saturday's market gets
more families out for a little shopping.</LD>
<LD>   Shoppers flocked around grower Arnulfo Garcia of Kingsburg,
Calif., at last week's Tuesday market to see his unusual nectarines.
Some years ago, he said, he discovered a mutation on a neighbor's
peach tree, a branch bearing distinctive nectarines with bronzed
orange yellow skin and flesh, and spicy, old-fashioned flavor. These
"mango nectarines," as Garcia called them after he grafted some trees
over to the new variety, will probably still be for sale, along with
his first picking of Red Ace plums, an old Luther Burbank variety
with blood-red skin and flesh. He also has round Flame grapes, one of
the earliest varieties of the new crop from the San Joaquin Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Another good stone-fruit farmer, Ken Lee of Orosi, Calif., sells
Honeykist yellow nectarines, one of the best-flavored of modern
low-acid types. He also sells Arctic Jay and Arctic Queen white
nectarines, both very sweet when ripe, but a bit bland to palates
accustomed to classic sweet-tart fruit. Soon he should be bringing in
luscious yellow Flavor Queen Pluots.</LD>
<TE>   Vilma Causey of Kingsburg has started offering Ichiban Nashi
("first pear" in Japanese), the earliest variety of Asian
pear--crunchy, mildly sweet and refreshingly juicy. Soon she'll have
Shinseiki, a leading variety with bright yellow skin and firm, almost
rock-like texture. Such pears last into winter, but have better
flavor (because when first harvested they still have a tinge of
acidity) in the dog days of summer, straight from the refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   Nora and Raul Rios of Fallbrook have fine Hass avocados, now at
peak quality in several sizes and degrees of ripeness. Dan Hashiba of
Orange brings black Japanese eggplant, pink low-acid Japanese
tomatoes and mild green shishito peppers, which are typically
stir-fried, grilled or used in tempura.</TE>
<TE>   Toshi Goto and her sister, Yaeko, sell only at the Tuesday market,
where they are considered a treasure by regulars for their splendidly
fresh herbs and greens grown in Carson: among them, aromatic lemon
basil, flowering oregano, French and Spanish tarragon and epazote.
They also offer bunches of fresh shiso leaves for use in salads, as a
wrapper and as a garnish.</TE>

Street and Sepulveda Boulevard, Tuesdays and Saturdays, 8 a.m. to 1
p.m.</TE>

<HD>HOT BOWL</HD>
<DH>The Korean rice dish called bibim bap is landing on trendy
menus all over the city</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, Marc Urwand, the executive chef of the Standard hotel,
added a promising item to his menu. It was bibim bap, a dish known to
every Korean but very few others. Urwand thought that introducing it
was worth the gamble, that the timing seemed so right for that
journey from Koreatown to West Hollywood. How could anyone not love
it? A bowl of pure, pearly steamed rice, garnished with shreds of
seasoned vegetables and slivers of meat, a bit of egg and a
spicy-sweet chili sauce. Bibim bap was satisfying and light, and
beautiful to look at.</LD>
<LD>   But Urwand was wrong. Hollywood couldn't have cared less, and it
disappeared within a month.</LD>
<LD>   He should have waited a couple of years.</LD>
<TE>   Now, just look around. Bibim bap is the hottest Asian dish in
town. It has spread from mom-and-pop storefronts in Koreatown to
trendy restaurants in Old Town Pasadena and super-hip spots on the
Westside. It is being served in elegant hotel dining rooms, prepared
tableside in an almost French presentation. A chain restaurant
specializing in bibim bap is sprouting franchises around the city.</TE>
<TE>   It has even turned up in Hollywood--at the Sunday farmers market.</TE>
<TE>   Why is it catching on now? Everyone has a theory. It's heathy:
Bibim bap consists mostly of vegetables and very little meat, if any.
And it's comfortably like other, familiar rice dishes such as paella,
rice salad and fried rice, only the rice is steamed, not stir-fried
in oil. The recent World Cup games in South Korea also helped to
raise its profile. Soccer teams ate it when they played at Chonju,
the city in southwestern Korea considered the birthplace of bibim
bap. Fans heading to the games found it in all classes on Korean Air
and Asiana Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the first cross-cultural step took place about a
year ago, when Gyu-kaku, a Japanese-Korean restaurant, opened on the
Westside. The bibim bap was so popular, the restaurant added a second
version to the menu. Now diners can choose between bibim bap with
ground chicken and vegetables, or one with freshwater eel and mizuna,
a feathery green. Chaco Kim, the restaurant's director of business
development, estimates that her young, hip customers order 40 of the
rice bowls a night.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-food stands that aim at a Western market encouraged the
trend. David Kim draws lines of shoppers to his stall, Gourmet Korean
B.B.Q, at the Hollywood farmers market. "Once they know about bibim
bap, they order only that," he said. "They like it because it's pure,
natural and all vegetable, not cooked." Kim's vegetables are only
marinated, unlike most versions of the dish.</TE>
<TE>   Another fast-food outfit, Han's Bibimbap, educates customers with
placemats that explain how to eat the dish and list each ingredient
and its nutritional attributes. Han's has three outlets in central
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Even the name is appealing. It's snappy and fun to say. The word
bibim means mixed. Bap is cooked rice, specifically the sticky,
short-grained rice that Koreans favor. The rice is spooned into a
large bowl, then covered with an enticing pattern of vegetables.
Common toppings are carrots, daikon, shiitake mushrooms, soy bean
sprouts, mung bean sprouts, spinach, zucchini, cucumber, onion,
kimchi, lettuce and fine strands of dried seaweed.</TE>
<TE>   Chewy toraji (bellflower root) and kosari (fern bracken) are
popular in this Korean dish. Daikon sprouts, chrysanthemum leaves and
todok, a mountain root, appear in some versions. Sesame seeds and
sesame oil add subtle nutty flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to introduce as many colors, flavors and textures as
possible. "There is no rule" about what should be included, said
Byoung Soo Lim, director of the Korean Cultural Center in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Yang Ji Express, a stall in the Koreatown Galleria food court,
boasts that it has 20 toppings. Sa Rit Gol on Olympic Boulevard
offers 10. Vegetarian bimbim bap from the Hollywood farmers market
includes seven.</TE>
<TE>   A traditional bibim bap is often meatless, but more commonly, a
small amount of meat, typically beef but sometimes chicken, pork or
seafood, goes on top of the rice along with a fried egg or raw yolk.
The hot red pepper paste, kochujang, is served on the side, to be
added cautiously, because it packs a lot of fire power.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure is to stir the ingredients and kochujang together,
using a long-handled spoon, not chopsticks. You also use the spoon to
scoop up both rice and vegetables. The rice is usually hot and the
vegetables cool, so the effect is like an ornate rice salad.</TE>
<TE>   Another version of the dish, dol sot bibim bap,  is served in a
heavy stone pot heated to such a high temperature that the raw beef
and egg yolk cook as soon as they are stirred into the mixture. The
rice forms a deliciously crunchy, golden-brown crust.</TE>
<TE>   Bibim bap in Los Angeles remains as traditional as it is in Korea.
Western chefs have yet to do their own riff. The trendy Westside or
Pasadena places that serve it are Korean-owned or -managed and mostly
stick to standard versions. The most creative is Gyu-kaku's unagi
bibimba (that's the Japanese word for bibim bap), which contains
fresh water eel and mizuna. Kim, who was born and raised in Japan,
once had a Japanese restaurant, Chaco, in Beverly Hills. Remembering
the popularity of sushi with freshwater eel, she adapted that concept
to bibim bap.</TE>
<TE>   Crossing Over</TE>
<TE>   Temple, a stylish restaurant on La Cienega Boulevard, serves
modern Korean cuisine fused with California influences, but the bibim
bap is traditional. "It's an easy crossover," said Madison Gray, a
server, as she instructed a customer in how to eat the dish. "We
never had anyone say they didn't like it." Jun Kim, the owner,
estimated that 30% to 40% of the orders there are for bibim bap.</TE>
<TE>   Arirang in Old Town Pasadena serves three styles of traditional
bibim bap--vegetable, mountain vegetables (such as roots and wild
greens), and beef with vegetables--in a Korean-style setting. Sales
are brisk. "A lot of people like it," said manager Julia Kim.</TE>
<TE>   Many Koreans recommend Jeon Ju, a little storefront restaurant in
Koreatown that specializes in stone-pot dishes. The rice bowl there
comes with traditional side dishes: beef broth with seaweed, kimchi
and barley tea, served iced in summer. Little English is spoken, but
the waitresses are friendly--and tactful. When a non-Korean
struggling to pick up rice grains with chopsticks asked whether she
should use a spoon, the waitress said either way was correct.
Meanwhile, Korean women at the next table were gracefully, and
properly, scooping out their bowls with spoons.</TE>
<TE>   Some restaurants take liberties. Yang Ji Express sets out such
unconventional toppings as corn kernels, green peas and garbanzo
beans in a display that looks like a salad bar. An attendant in red
shirt and baseball cap rapidly plucks a bit of each ingredient into a
jumbo metal bowl. A separate bowl contains rice, to be mixed at the
table.</TE>
<TE>   Han's Bibimbap makes a sausage and bacon bowl, another topped with
masago (flying fish roe) and one with curry. David Kim at the farmers
market tops one of his bibim baps with chap chae, a Korean mixture of
clear noodles with vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Most bibim bap in Los Angeles is Chonju style, says Lim of the
cultural center. Chonju (also spelled Jeonju) is about 150 miles
south of Seoul, in a rich agricultural area that provides plenty of
vegetables for toppings. As many as 30 ingredients may appear in a
Chonju bibim bap.</TE>
<TE>   The city is regarded as the cuisine capital of South Korea, and
bibim bap one of its most popular dishes. It is thought to have first
appeared in the 1800s, traditionally eaten after rites honoring
departed ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   "We prepare a formal offering table, with all kinds of food--meat,
fish, vegetables, rice, wine," said Jongsoo Choo of Northridge, who
studied traditional Korean cuisine at one of Seoul's most prestigious
schools. "After the ceremony, we make a bibim bap out of that food.
The men do the offering service, which the women cannot attend even
though they prepare all the food. The men drink wine and some side
dishes. The women who work in the kitchen, they eat the bibim bap."</TE>
<TE>   Choo scoffs at accounts that say bibim bap was first eaten by
royalty. "It is not a formal dish," she said. "You can compare it to
a hamburger and hot dog."</TE>
<TE>   Today in Los Angeles, bibim bap spans a broad economic range, from
the $5 farmers market dish in a Styrofoam bowl to the $18.25 raw-beef
version at Seoul Jung in the Wilshire Grand Hotel. That one is
finished off with luxury ingredients--pine nuts ground to a powder
and a raw quail egg yolk. The serving bowl is costly Kwangju Yo brand
Korean celadon, and the ambience is that of an aristocratic wooden
Korean dwelling, with gleaming wooden floors, wood trim, fine art and
flowers. You don't even have to mix the bibim bap. The waitress does
it for you.</TE>
<TE>   Prices are much higher on the Westside than in Koreatown. Woo Lae
Oak on La Cienega charges $18 for stone-pot bibim bap, compared with
$8.34 at Jeon Ju. Temple's $14 bibim bap is nicely served with kimchi
and other side dishes presented on a long slim tray. Gyu-kaku, where
prices are moderate ($6.95 and $7.95), pampers its guests with
tableside service. Servers carry the ferociously hot stone pots to
the table on wooden holders and check customers' tolerance for hot
chile before mixing in the kochujang.</TE>
<TE>   Most Koreans prefer to eat bibim bap in restaurants rather than
prepare it themselves. "I made bibim bap one time at home," said
Sejung Kim of the Korean Cultural Center. "I will never make it
again. Too much work."</TE>
<TE>   The easy way out is to plop leftovers onto a bowl of rice for a
quick meal. Still another option is to buy frozen bibim bap such as
Cheonil Korean bibim bap stocked by the market in the Koreatown
Galleria. This vegetarian rice bowl is packed in Korea, but
instructions are provided in English. It's a simple dish, with just a
few vegetables including fern bracken, bellflower and carrots. When
reheated, it tastes freshly made. The kochujang sauce, packaged
separately, is more complex than some restaurant sauces here.</TE>
<TE>   Although a minority, there are some people who don't like the
dish. "I would starve to death if I had to eat that," said a Korean
Air passenger who asked not to be named, "but the rest of the plane
was just gobbling it up. They couldn't get enough of it."</TE>
<TE>   Koreans are proud when they see others trying the dish. In the
glossy, spacious food court of the Koreatown Galleria, a middle-aged
woman rushed up to ask one such customer, "You like that bibim bap?"
When the answer was "yes," she smiled and said, "I'm so glad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beginner's Bibim Bap</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   This is a beginner's recipe because it takes several shortcuts,
such as using bottled marinade. Cook the beef just before assembling
the dish. Bulgogi beef, bottled bulgogi marinade and red pepper paste
are found at Korean markets. Bottled kimchi can be found in the Asian
aisle of well-stocked supermarkets and at Asian markets. Nori may be
labeled dried laver in Korean markets.</TE>
<TE>   BEEF</TE>
<TE>   4 slices (1/8 pound) bulgogi beef</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons bottled bulgogi marinade</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon oil</TE>
<TE>   Place the beef in a bowl, add the bulgogi marinade, cover and
refrigerate, 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the beef from the marinade and cut into 1/2-inch slices.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and
stir-fry until cooked through, 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   VEGETABLES</TE>
<TE>   4 fresh shiitake mushrooms, sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon oil</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon bottled bulgogi marinade</TE>
<TE>   4 cups spinach</TE>
<TE>   2 carrots, cut into very thin, long strips</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups soy bean sprouts</TE>
<TE>   1 large zucchini, cut into very thin slices</TE>
<TE>   Cook the mushrooms in the oil and the marinade in a skillet over
high heat until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   The spinach, carrots and soy bean sprouts need to be blanched in
separate pots of boiling water. Blanch the spinach 30 seconds. Drain
and squeeze dry. Blanch the carrots, 1 minute; the soybean sprouts,
30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the zucchini in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   RICE</TE>
<TE>   2 cups short-grain rice</TE>
<TE>   Wash the rice several times in cold water until the water is
clear, rubbing the rice well. Drain. Place the rice in a heavy pot;
add 3 cups of cold water. Cover and bring to a boil, reduce the heat
and steam, covered, until the rice is tender, about 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   SAUCE</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup red pepper paste (kochujang)</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons honey</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon sesame oil</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   Combine the red pepper paste, sesame seeds, honey, oil and garlic
in a small bowl. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup bottled kimchi, cut into thin strips</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon sesame seeds</TE>
<TE>   1/2 sheet (8-inch-square) nori seaweed, sliced into fine, thin
strips</TE>
<TE>   1 fried egg</TE>
<TE>   To assemble the bibim bap, place the hot cooked rice in a large
serving bowl. The vegetables can be at room temperature. Arrange them
on top of the rice in separate groups, along with the kimchi.
Sprinkle with the sesame oil and sesame seeds. Arrange the beef on
top and a small pile of nori strips at one side. Place the egg in the
center.</TE>
<TE>   Pass the sauce in a separate bowl. Add this to taste and stir it
into the mixture, preferably with a long-handled Korean spoon.</TE>

<HD>A New Way to Char Tomato Skins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The technique used to blacken the tomatoes for Salsa Negra is one we
had never encountered before in the Times Test Kitchen. We were
slightly skeptical about placing the tomatoes in a water bath beneath
the broiler. But it worked perfectly.</LD>
<LD>   We placed the whole tomatoes in a 13x9-inch baking pan and poured
in enough water to come halfway up the tomatoes. We placed the pan on
the top rack of the oven directly beneath the broiler--about 3 inches
away. The exposed part of the tomatoes blackened, and the skin began
to curl in 15 to 20 minutes. The size of the tomatoes and the actual
heat of the broiler could make this time vary.</LD>
<LD>   Because the tomatoes were in the water bath, they did not fall
apart. They could be turned over easily with tongs. When the second
side was blackened, the tomatoes could be removed whole and placed in
the blender.</LD>
<TE>   The advantage of the water bath is that the tomatoes do not
overcook, yet they char beautifully. The final benefit is that the
pan is a snap to clean.</TE>

<HD>It's Corn Season, so Let's Go for It</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresh corn seems to inexplicably cry out for the addition of some
kind of mellowing ingredient. Think of a grilled, lightly charred ear
slathered with butter, or a thick corn soup sweetened with plenty of
cream.</LD>
<LD>   But why is that? We all know corn doesn't need it. Fresh corn, all
by itself, is so sweet and so creamy it needs very little--or nothing
at all.</LD>
<LD>   We looked at salads and soups, even puddings and waffles, and
asked, why not do without most of the fat? Why not enjoy the purity
of corn flavor, and make it healthy at the same time?</LD>
<TE>   Our garden salad of lightly cooked corn kernels and chopped
tomatoes relies on their juices for a natural dressing. Combined with
a little tart vinegar, the juices bring out the flavors of the salad,
which includes sliced green onions and chopped celery. Most salad
dressings depend on heavy oils to temper sharp acidic flavors. But
the corn juices have so much substance that this dressing doesn't
need a drop of oil.</TE>
<TE>   And what about a soup without cream? So many corn chowders and
soups use it liberally, sending calories and fat rocketing. Our
version is based on a corn broth made by simply simmering the cobs in
water for about an hour. We did add a touch of butter for a little
richness, but that's it for added fat. Top off each serving with
freshly ground pepper and a sprinkle of chopped basil or cilantro
leaves. Nothing could taste fresher.</TE>
<TE>   The modern varieties of supersweet corn are so filled with natural
sugar that they make an almost fruity addition to a light waffle
batter. Our recipe uses low-fat buttermilk and less butter then most.
Beaten egg whites--which have no fat or cholesterol--are folded in
for added volume and fluffiness. At serving time, skip the maple
syrup and butter and try a sprinkle of powdered sugar instead.</TE>
<TE>   Or, if you have fresh strawberries on hand, they're wonderful with
the waffles. Lightly crush half a pint. Stir in about two tablespoons
of sugar (or more, depending on the sweetness of the berries). Let
them stand about 30 minutes, then serve on top of the warm waffles.
And what about waffles for dessert? Fold the warm waffles in half,
fill each with a tablespoon of low-fat frozen yogurt and eat
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Corn pudding is, of course, an old-fashioned favorite, but most
versions are loaded with butter and cream. Ours calls for egg
substitute instead of eggs and low-fat milk rather than cream.
There's just a bit of butter. Still, the texture is voluptuous and
deeply satisfying. Because it has so little fat, the top tends not to
get brown during baking. So we give the pudding a nudge under the
broiler so it browns nicely. And don't forget the sprinkle of grated
fresh nutmeg over the top.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, you probably can't help but grill and butter a few
ears--fresh corn is hard to resist that way too. But with these light
recipes, it's even more appealing.</TE>

<LD>The idea of serving wines by the carafe is old hat in France and
Italy, but in America it's always seemed a bit downscale and tacky.
It took a New York restaurateur to turn it into a trend in this
country, one that is just beginning to take off in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of serving plonk by the pitcher, or jug wines decanted
into old wine bottles, restaurateurs are discovering the potential in
offering interesting and high-end wines in a delicate carafe. For
those of us who care about drinking well without necessarily drinking
a lot, this alternative to ordering an entire bottle or an overpriced
glass is something to celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   I almost never order a glass of wine in a restaurant, because I
hate drinking from a glass filled to the top. You can't swirl the
wine. You can't enjoy its bouquet, which is a big part of its
pleasure. It's also rarely a bargain. When I go out to dinner by
myself (which doesn't happen often, admittedly), if I can order by
the carafe, I usually drink better, and happier.</LD>
<TE>   That's because restaurants that have carafes generally offer a
more interesting choice of wines in this format, and the price is
often proportional to the price of the same wine by the bottle. If
you're two at dinner, being able to buy a third or two-thirds of a
bottle allows you to drink a white or a rose with the appetizer, and
a red, or even two, with the main course. And with the carafe, I
don't have to put my hand over the glass every time the waiter tries
to pour more wine into an already full glass. I can pour my own.</TE>
<TE>   The trend began in 1998 with the opening of Babbo, Mario Batali's
Italian restaurant in New York. Joe Bastianich, his partner, came up
with an alternative to wines by the glass: the quartino. A quarter of
a liter, it works out to be one-third of a conventional
750-milliliter wine bottle, enough for two to enjoy a small glass, or
to carry one diner through a plate of pasta.</TE>
<TE>   Bastianich got the idea from his great-grandfather from Trieste,
who, he says, was a great customer of the local osteria. "His
nickname was quarticce, for his habit of drinking many quartinos
throughout the day."</TE>
<TE>   The idea has worked so well that they've, in fact, never served a
single glass of wine at Babbo or their other New York restaurants,
Lupa and Esca. "When you start getting into quality wines, wine by
the glass becomes a nebulous concept," says Bastianich, author of the
new book "Vino Italiano" (Clarkson Potter, 2002). "In Italy wines are
sold by the measure, so the wine drinker knows exactly how much he's
getting and how much he's paying for it."</TE>
<TE>   The most ambitious carafe program in Los Angeles is at Angelini
Osteria, where Barry Herbst is the wine buyer and sommelier. You can
order five whites and seven or eight reds by the glass, or in a
carafe that holds either a third of a bottle (250 milliliters) or
two-thirds (500 milliliters). The latter is perfect for two people.
Herbst has selected some truly interesting Italian wines, such as a
Greco di Tufo, the minerally honey-scented white from the area south
of Naples, or an eclectic blend of Sangiovese and Nero d'Avola (the
grape that has been called, optimistically, the Nebbiolo of the south
of Italy) from Puglia. Or Foradori's Teroldego, an intriguing red
made from an indigenous northern Italian grape.</TE>
<TE>   There are a couple of things Herbst likes about the carafes. If a
table is indecisive about what wine to choose, the problem is easily
solved by ordering two or three different carafes.</TE>
<TE>   "The carafe thing really smooths over any disputes," says Herbst.
Everybody is happy. He's also able to showcase higher-end wines,
which probably wouldn't get as much play by the glass, or even by the
bottle.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, he was pouring the luscious Minaia Gavi--until
it ran out. He's just added the 1997 Campaccio, a super Tuscan from
Fattoria Terrabianca, and a higher-end Chianti Classico from
Querciabella in the beautiful 1999 vintage. He even sells a Tuscan
dessert wine, Isole e Olena's tawny vin santo, in a diminutive
carafe.</TE>
<TE>   Gouging by the Glass</TE>
<TE>   Herbst also sees the carafe as the solution for Angelenos who need
to be careful about how much we drink because of the driving we do
here. "If you don't want to order an entire bottle, at most
restaurants, you're stuck with ordering wine by the glass, and that's
where some restaurateurs look to make unreasonable profit," he says.
"It's bad enough that wine bottles are marked up 300%, but on glasses
of wine they're sometimes making 900% or 1,000%."</TE>
<TE>   Distributors often discount wines in a wines-by-the-glass program
if a restaurateur will commit to buying a large quantity of one wine.
The inducement is a larger profit margin per glass. Carafes on the
other hand are usually priced closer to wines by the bottle, which
generally have a two- to 2 1/2-times markup, but can also be as high
as three or four times.</TE>
<TE>   Another advantage to the carafe is that it allows restaurants to
work in large-format bottles, says Bastianich. "Importers bring them
in, but never know what to do with them, so we can almost always buy
them for a little bit less," he says. "We can open double magnums
[the equivalent of four bottles] or imperials [eight bottles] and all
these cool sizes."</TE>
<TE>   For diners, the advantage is that wines in large-format bottles
age in a different way and have a different sensibility than the same
wine from a normal bottle. But how many times does anybody at home
have the opportunity to open a magnificent double magnum or jeroboam?
Or pour wines like the '89 Gaja Barbaresco or '93 and '95 Fontalloro
as they've done at Babbo?</TE>
<TE>   Some wine drinkers, though, are wary of anything served in a
carafe. How do you know what you're really getting? At Babbo,
Bastianich shows off the large-format bottles by pouring the wine
tableside.</TE>
<TE>   "When we have a five-liter bottle, people go bananas," he says,
laughing. The biggest they ever poured was an enormous 12-liter
Cennatoio Chianti Classico riserva. How heavy is that bottle, I
couldn't help wondering. "You need one strong guy to pour it
tableside," he says. "There's a lot of wine machismo involved--it's
very testosterone-driven wine service."</TE>
<TE>   Other New York restaurants have followed Babbo's lead, some coming
up with their own moniker for the carafe. At the recently closed
Atlas, a high-flier in its day, wines were ordered by the "philip."
Ilo, the sleek restaurant in the year-old Bryant Park Hotel mid-town,
serves 17 or 18 "wines by the measure," i.e., 250 milliliters or
one-third of a bottle, from $11 for a Vouvray from Domaine des
Aubuisieres to $25 for a 1998 Chateau Montelena Cabernet Sauvignon
"Calistoga Cuvee."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Import</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, Debbie Zachareas thought the carafe idea she'd
seen at Babbo would be perfect for bacar, the wine-oriented
restaurant she and partner Arnold Wong opened in December 2000.
Thinking large, she started off offering 100 wines by the glass in
2-ounce pours, 5-ounce glasses--and 250-milliliter or 500-milliliter
carafes. The price of a carafe, she says, is a third or two-thirds of
the bottle price.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the goal is for people to try three different one-third
bottles rather than one full bottle if they want to kind of play and
compare wines with food. It's a nice alternative--especially if
somebody can't decide between red and white," she explains. She's
recently pared her selection down to 64, but no matter, it's still an
astonishing array (supplemented by about 1,400 selections by the
bottle).</TE>
<TE>   When technology stocks were at their height, the wine salon
downstairs became an ongoing dot-commer party with carafes littering
every horizontal surface. "Once the idea of the carafe caught on,
everyone thought it was really such a cool way to try wines," says
Zachareas.</TE>
<TE>   In the Napa Valley, Bouchon, the bistro sidekick to Thomas
Keller's formal French Laundry, is playing up its carafe program,
too. The Yountville bistro's general manager, Guy Rebentisch, points
out that selling wine by the carafe is a tradition in France.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to make Bouchon as authentic as possible, so we wanted to
serve local wines." In essence, they're reinventing the idea of house
wines. "The advantage for us is that we're able to get these wines,
which in some cases would otherwise be bulked out, and offer them at
an incredibly reasonable price. The other advantage is that I'm able
to serve things that nobody else can."</TE>
<TE>   People love the idea of drinking local wines--and why not, if you
happen to be based in the Napa Valley and the wines are easier on the
pocketbook than the valley's top bottlings? At Bouchon, the five
carafe wines are listed on a blackboard. Right now one of the whites
is a Turnbull Sauvignon Blanc from Napa Valley, which can be found in
wine shops. But the rose is a Syrah-Pinot Noir blend from a local
vintner, while the reds are exclusive to Bouchon.</TE>
<TE>   "One is a Miner Family Cabernet Franc and then from Michael
Havens, I've got a Pinot-Syrah blend. And they are exclusive,"
Rebentisch repeats with the fervency of a local TV anchor touting a
story. He caught Havens with some extra wine, worked out a blend
together, and voila. He's done the same thing with the Miner Family
vineyard. Bouchon's carafe wines are sold by the half-liter ($14 to
$16) or full liter ($28 to $32) in glass carafes etched with the
Bouchon logo. They're so popular, in fact, customers want to buy them
to take home.</TE>
<TE>   An L.A. Embrace</TE>
<TE>   Well before Babbo, bacar, or Bouchon, though, Campanile was
serving wines in carafes. The restaurant still does, in fact, but its
program is so understated, you'd hardly notice unless you happened to
look over the page of the list devoted to wines by the glass.</TE>
<TE>   There at the bottom is a list of five wines by the taster carafe
(8 ounces) or by a third of a bottle, ranging from $13 for a Seresin
Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand to $20 for Pojer &amp; Sandri's 1995
Rosso Faye, a Cabernet-Merlot blend from Northern Italy. The program
was set up by Manfred Krankl, one of the partners, when Campanile
opened in 1989, and it's still perking along under the present wine
buyer George Cossette.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the carafes because I can get people to try a wine they
might not ordinarily try, a Riesling for example," says Cossette.
"And I can offer it by the carafe at a better price than by the
glass. Why penalize people for trying something new? Right now, for
example, we have this Arnaud Ente Bourgogne Aligote. His wines are
highly allocated, and they don't make much of it. I think his wines
are really interesting, but even two cases of Bourgogne Aligote would
take me forever to sell, but if I put it on by the carafe, No. 1, I
can sell it, and No. 2, give the staff and myself the opportunity to
talk about it with people."</TE>
<TE>   When entrepreneur Paul Fleming launched Fleming's Prime Steakhouse
in Newport Beach in 1998, in order to distinguish it from the
competition, he and partner Lisa Lumsden, decided to give the new
restaurant a strong focus on wine by offering 100 by the glass. The
difference is that they're poured from a nifty small carafe, which
looks something like the sidecar that comes with your martini at
Musso &amp; Frank. The glasses, each large enough to hold an entire
bottle of wine (that's some breathing room) are already on the table.
The waiter brings out the decanter of whatever you've ordered and
pours half of the 6-ounce pour into the glass, leaving plenty of room
to swirl without any risk of losing a drop.</TE>
<TE>   A few other Southern California places have picked up on the
carafe idea, including Water Grill in downtown L.A. With your dozen
oysters or elaborate fruits-of-the-sea platter, for example, you
could drink a Bricout brut Champagne for $16, a crisp Muscadet from
the Loire Valley for $8, or a Central Coast Riesling from Firestone
Vineyard for $6.75. The surprise here is that among the dozen wines
on offer are two Navarro Vineyards non-alcoholic "wines" made from
unfermented grape juice</TE>
<TE>   The latest converts to the carafe are Suzanne Goin and Caroline
Styne. The Lucques partners plan to present wines by the glass in a
carafe when they open their wine and food bar in September on 3rd
Street in Los Angeles. They'll offer flights of wines in 2-ounce
pours, along with 50 wines by the glass--served in a small
carafe--and a wine list of about 200 bottles.</TE>
<TE>   "I know myself, I have the habit of swirling wine in order to
enjoy the aromatics, so I always end up ordering half a glass in a
restaurant, or an extra wineglass on the side," says Styne. "Because
when I get a full glass, I sometimes forget you can't swirl it."</TE>
<TE>   She and Goin, who is the chef, know everything about their new
place, except the name. "We just haven't fallen in love with a name
yet," Styne groans. "We have to hash that out in the next couple of
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Will they also be giving their carafe an affectionate little name?
That remains to be seen.</TE>

<HD>New Recipe for Ponzu: Just Open the Jar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAYI BRADY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ponzu, a Japanese sauce usually consisting of soy sauce, lemon juice,
vinegar and a little sugar, can be a bit tricky to make. Too much of
one ingredient can throw off the taste. That's why I was thrilled to
find bottled ponzu in the supermarket--there's no trick to opening a
bottle.</LD>
<LD>   Take five minutes to add a few ingredients to the ponzu and you've
got a great glaze for chicken. Serve this with stir-fried bok choy
and steamed jasmine rice, and you've got a meal. The glaze also would
work well on grilled shrimp or fish.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Plate and napkin from Windows, Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Bottled ponzu is found in the Asian aisle of well-stocked
supermarkets and at Japanese markets. While an outdoor grill or
stove-top grill pan is best, the chicken can be cooked in a skillet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ponzu-Glazed Chicken</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   4 boneless, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3/4 pound)</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons bottled ponzu</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon lime juice</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon minced ginger root</TE>
<TE>   1 large clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 serrano chile, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Rinse and dry the
chicken thighs. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the ponzu, lime juice, ginger, garlic, chile and sugar in
a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring, just until the
sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Place the chicken, skin side down, on the grill. Brush the top of
the chicken with the ponzu mixture. Turn the chicken over every 2
minutes or so, brushing with the sauce every time until the chicken
is cooked through, about 10 minutes.</TE>

<LD>"A '99 Cote Rotie. The producer was Jean-Michel Gerin--one of his
vineyard-designated wines. It was not only a very nice wine but
special because in 2000, we had sent our winemaker to the Rhone
Valley. When he was there, he tasted this wine out of the barrel. So
he gave a bottle of it to me for Christmas. It's very concentrated
with forward fruit, raspberries, blueberries. It has a nice smoky
character and a slight earthy and mineral quality, a very complex
wine with lots of good fruit and concentration."</LD>

<LD>Grilled shrimp makes for quick summer meals at my house. I like to
prepare it in one of two ways, and I often grill extra. Then I have
leftover shrimp for these big-flavor quesadillas.</LD>
<LD>   You can peel, marinate and thread the shrimp on skewers to grill;
or leave the shells on, rub the shrimp all over with a chile-based
spice rub (homemade or store-bought) and toss them on the grill. Have
tongs ready for turning. The shrimp are grilled to perfection in
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   One pound of medium-large shrimp (about 25 per pound) serves four.
Buy an extra half-pound for these quesadillas.</LD>
<TE>   Morgan is coauthor of "Dressed to Grill: Savvy Recipes for Girls
Who Play With Fire" (Chronicle Books, $16.95).</TE>
<TE>   Queso fresco slices more easily and crumbles less if cut when
cold.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grilled Shrimp Quesadillas</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   1 large sweet onion, such as a Vidalia or Walla Walla, thinly
sliced</TE>
<TE>   4 (10-inch) flour tortillas</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound grilled shrimp, peeled, halved lengthwise</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups halved cherry tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   12 ounces queso fresco or Muenster cheese, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   Salsa, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Heat a large heavy skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high
heat. Add the oil, swirl to coat the pan, and immediately add the
sliced onion. Cook the slices, stirring frequently, until well
browned (almost a little charred) at the edges but still
crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Adjust the heat higher, if necessary,
so the onions cook quickly. Remove to a plate and wipe out the
skillet. Turn the heat to medium.</TE>
<TE>   To assemble the quesadillas, divide the onion among the tortillas,
spreading them over half of each tortilla. Divide the shrimp among
the tortillas, arranging it on top of the onion. Scatter the tomatoes
and cilantro evenly over the shrimp. Arrange the cheese over the
filling. Fold the tortillas over to form half-circles.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the skillet over medium heat. Place 1 or 2 tortillas in the
pan (depending on the size of the pan) and cook until the bottom is
nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Use a wide spatula or 2
spatulas--sandwiching the tortilla between them--to turn the
quesadillas. Brown the other side, making sure the cheese melts.
Place on a cutting board. Repeat to make the other quesadillas.</TE>
<TE>   Use a sharp knife to cut each quesadilla into 3 wedges. Arrange on
warm dinner plates and serve immediately with salsa.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: Perhaps as many as 15 or 20 years ago, The Times printed a

delicious. Can you reprint it?</LD>
<LD>   GINA ZUCCHERO</LD>
<LD>   Thousand Oaks</LD>
<TE>   DEAR GINA: This is a quick bread, meaning baking soda is used as a
leavener instead of yeast. If your baking soda is old, buy a new box.
Your bread will rise up beautifully. Slice it thin and lightly toast
it for breakfast. It's great.</TE>

<TE>   Pizza is a snap to make with this ready-made dough. It takes just
minutes to roll out and pat into a pan. Keep good-quality Parmesan,

<LD>It's easy to miss TiGeorges' Chicken, a small eatery along a strip of
Glendale Boulevard near downtown Los Angeles. But do look for it,
because TiGeorges' offers something rare in L.A.--genuine
Haitian-style barbecued chicken. Marinated overnight, then grilled
over avocado wood, the chicken is smothered in garlic-wine sauce and
accompanied by sides such as red beans and rice, green salad and
pikliz, a finely shredded cabbage and carrot pickle. Haiti's famous
ti malis sauce is on hand, but watch out--this is one of the hottest
sauces you will ever taste. (Its name means "little malice.")</LD>
<LD>   An order of a quarter chicken (choice of white or dark meat), red
beans and rice, green salad and pikliz is $4.75. Whole and half
chickens are also available. A 24-ounce jar of pikliz (spicier than
that served at the restaurant) is $4 at TiGeorges' Chicken, 309 N.
Glendale Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 353-9994.</LD>

<DH>1997 Trimbach Riesling "Cuvee Frederic-Emile," Alsace,
France.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Riesling is gorgeous with food, but it doesn't exactly fly off the
shelves around here. Maybe that's because not enough wine drinkers
have tasted a truly great example.</LD>
<LD>   This is one, perhaps the best that Maison Trimbach has made in
years. Tense and tightly coiled, it reveals its facets of minerals,
citrus and vivacious acidity slowly in the glass. It has a long
languid finish that just goes on and on.</LD>
<LD>   Like other Alsatian Rieslings, it is absolutely dry and
beautifully pitched, like a clear-toned bell. It weaves its magic on
all sorts of food but seems especially suited to seafood and Asian
food.</LD>
<TE>   About $33. Available at Beverage Warehouse in Marina del Rey,

a form of common interest subdivision in which the individual owner
gets an undivided interest in the project and the right to occupy a
specific unit.</LD>

<LD>SAT testing--An article in Tuesday's Section A about an end to the
flagging of SAT scores when disabled students received special
accommodations incorrectly described the Educational Testing Service
and its relationship with the College Board. ETS is a nonprofit
corporation that administers the SAT college entrance exam for the
College Board. While ETS is a contractor for the College Board, the
two entities are independent.</LD>

<HD>Wells Fargo, Bank One Post Profits on Consumer Lending</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bank One Corp. said second-quarter profit grew
on credit card fees and increased demand for consumer loans,
including mortgages.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender,
had net income of $1.42 billion, or 82 cents a share, after a loss in
the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   Bank One, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank, said profit climbed 27% to
$843 million, or 71 cents a share, from $664 million, or 56 cents, a
year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Short-term interest rates at 40-year lows have helped bolster
consumer demand for loans and pared the cost of funds for banks,
helping consumer-oriented institutions such as Wells Fargo and Bank
One. Some of their rivals have been hurt by foreign loans and by
declines in corporate investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Wells Fargo gained 5 cents to $47.20 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Bank One shares rose $1.60 to $37.41.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo's lending income rose 21% to $3.67 billion as the net
interest margin, or the difference between what a bank pays for funds
and gets for loans, widened to 5.66 percentage points from 5.31
points in the year-earlier quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth-biggest U.S. bank generated $60 billion in new mortgages
in the quarter, a rise of 33% from the year-earlier quarter, as more
people sought to finance homes at low interest rates. Chief Executive
Richard Kovacevich has focused on 20 million household clients to
help boost earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "We had more mortgage applications in the pipeline at the end of
the quarter than ever before," Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer
Howard Atkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Bank One Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has benefited from a growing
credit card business, First USA Inc.</TE>
<TE>   First USA, bolstered by the purchase in 2001 of Wachovia Corp.'s
credit card portfolio, had fewer loan losses and added card
customers. The unit's revenue increased 12% to $2.01 billion from a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago-based bank's revenue from service charges, including
fees from credit cards and deposits, rose 25% to $2.23 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Washington Mutual Inc., the largest U.S. savings and loan, said
second-quarter earnings rose 23%, helped by strong loan volume and
retail checking-account growth. Net income rose to $984 million, or
$1.01 a share, from $798 million, or 91 cents, a year earlier, the
Seattle-based company said.</TE>
<TE>   * Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, the eighth-largest U.S. bank,
said second-quarter profit rose 46% as fees from processing credit
card and automated teller machine transactions climbed. Net income
totaled $823 million, or 43 cents a share, up from $562.3 million, or
29 cents, in the same quarter a year ago, when merger costs lowered
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   * Pittsburgh-based Mellon Financial Corp. said operating earnings
fell to $106 million, or 24 cents a share, from $118 million, or 25
cents, in the same quarter last year. The bank said it set aside $101
million to write off loans to WorldCom Inc., which is under
investigation after revealing that it improperly accounted for
expenses and misstated profit.</TE>
<TE>   * City National Corp., parent of City National Bank in Beverly
Hills, had second-quarter earnings of $45.8 million, or 88 cents a
share, up 16% from $39.6 million, or 80 cents, in the same quarter
last year. A strong increase in deposits helped offset a higher
provision for loan losses as City National continues to reduce its
loans to media and telecommunications companies, Chief Executive
Russell Goldsmith said.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Computer Associates International Inc. said three board members,
including the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, are leaving
because of new corporate rules that limit how long they can serve. A
fourth board member is leaving because of other business commitments.</LD>
<LD>   The four new members will replace Richard Grasso of the New York
Stock Exchange; Shirley Strum Kenny; Roel Pieper and Willem De Vogel.
Grasso, Kenny and De Vogel are leaving because of the new term
limits, Computer Associates said, and Pieper, a venture capitalist
and a member since 1999, will not seek reelection.</LD>
<LD>   The new board members--who include Kenneth Cron, chief executive
of the games division of Vivendi Universal of France, and Thomas
Wyman, a former chairman and chief executive of CBS Inc.--will have
to stand for election at the company's annual meeting on Aug. 28.</LD>
<TE>   The other new members are Robert La Blanc, former vice chairman of
Continental Telecom Corp., and Alex Serge Vieux, a technology and
software entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Computer Associates were up 19 cents at $13.32 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Jonathan Adelstein, the Democratic nominee for an opening on the
Federal Communications Commission, sailed through his long-delayed
Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday, saying he will focus on
accelerating the roll-out of Internet broadband and providing
telecommunications services to rural and underserved areas.</LD>
<LD>   Adelstein, 39, a top telecommunications aide to Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), avoided questions about his specific
views, but said the telecommunications industry was in the midst of a
crisis and vowed to help rebuild confidence.</LD>
<LD>   Adelstein is expected to be a voice for rural America on the
commission. The South Dakota native's nomination has been blocked
since last year due to squabbling largely unrelated to his record or
qualifications. He is expected to easily win Senate approval.</LD>

<HD>Producer Sells the Rights to Jackson Project</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The executive producer of Michael Jackson's aborted "What More Can I
Give" single sold the rights to the charity project for $1 million to
a Japanese company and kept half of it for himself.</LD>
<LD>   The transaction was negotiated quietly in February between F. Marc
Schaffel and Tokyo-based Music Fighters Corp., just three months
after Jackson's advisors fired Schaffel when they learned that he was
tied to the gay pornography business.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, representatives for Jackson, Schaffel and Music
Fighters confirmed the sale, which included a provision under which
Schaffel was paid a $500,000 fee.</LD>
<TE>   The deal is the latest twist in the bizarre tale of the troubled
charity project, which was recorded last fall to benefit victims of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and included performances by Jackson
and two dozen other stars.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson signed over the song rights to Schaffel last summer
without notifying his manager or attorney. In November, Jackson's
advisors severed all ties with the producer. And Jackson's
representatives lobbied Sony Music to refuse permission for its stars
to appear on the single.</TE>
<TE>   But Schaffel then cut a $1-million deal under which the Japanese
company agreed to pay more than $400,000 in bills to vendors
associated with the charity project.</TE>

<HD>Fears Offset Upbeat Words</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Greenspan's optimistic comments fail to extend
Monday's late turnaround. Blue chips bear brunt of selling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks closed broadly lower Tuesday, unable to sustain Monday's late
rally despite relatively upbeat comments from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the Fed chief's assessment of the economy sent Treasury
bond yields up sharply. But the dollar continued to languish.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, blue-chip shares continued to be the primary
targets of sellers. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down
166.08 points, or 1.9%, at 8,473.11, after diving as much as 233
points in early trading, rallying almost back to even by midday, then
sinking again in late trading.</LD>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slid 16.99 points, or 1.9%, to 900.94,
its lowest close since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite held up better than blue
chips, as it has for the last week. Nasdaq slipped 7.36 points, or
0.5%, to 1,375.26. The index hit a five-year low of 1,346 last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow plunged as much as 440 points Monday before recovering
almost all of that decline by the close. The rebound raised hopes
that the 2-year-old bear market had reached a "capitulation" phase
that was shaking out investors who had been on the fence, paving the
way for at least a near-term market bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan, testifying before a Senate panel, painted a generally
positive picture of the economy. But he warned that there will be
continuing fallout from corporate scandals, and said he expects to
see a lot of companies restating their earnings in the next month,
ahead of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Aug. 14 deadline
for chief executives to certify their companies' results.</TE>
<TE>   So far, second-quarter earnings reports have been mixed. Investors
have been expecting the average blue-chip company to report a modest
profit increase for the quarter. Some banks on Tuesday reported
robust gains, as did Nextel Communications.</TE>
<TE>   But there also were some troubling reports. Machinery giant
Caterpillar slid $2.19 to $43 after reporting lower earnings and
cutting its 2002 estimate, citing weak capital spending by
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Also, appliance makers Maytag and Whirlpool reported strong
second-quarter earnings, but both warned that earnings would slow in
the second half. Maytag sank $6.54 to $32.32, and Whirlpool slid
$6.63 to $56.28.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more fear than fundamentals" in the market, said Thomas
Garcia, who helps manage $2.5 billion for Thornburg Investment
Management. "People are selling just in case earnings are weak and
the [hoped-for] outlook isn't there."</TE>
<TE>   Falling stocks outnumbered winners by 19 to 13 on the New York
Stock Exchange, though losers and winners were nearly even on Nasdaq.
Trading was heavy.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expressed disappointment that the market couldn't advance
after Monday's dramatic turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get a powerful up day with great breadth" to make the
case that a bottom has been reached, said Ed Nicoski, technical
analyst at brokerage U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   He said the market's capitulation phase could be stretched out
over a long period if mutual funds continue to face cash outflows,
forcing fund managers to sell stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe the selling pressure on blue-chip shares
over the last week stems from mutual fund redemptions, as fund
managers sell some of their most liquid stocks to raise cash.</TE>
<TE>   In the Treasury bond market yields rose across the board Tuesday,
responding to Greenspan. Analysts said the Fed chief's tone reminded
bond owners that the next major move for interest rates is likely to
be up, if the economy continues to recover.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the two-year T-note rose to 2.61% from 2.54% Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But higher yields didn't help the dollar. The euro held at $1.01,
its highest since February 2000, while the dollar fell to 116.04 yen
from 116.31.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Tech and telecom stocks gaining despite the broader market's
losses included: FreeMarkets, up $1.39 to $12; Dell Computer, up 71
cents to $26.19; and Juniper Networks, up 25 cents to $8.31.</TE>
<TE>   But IBM fell $1.99 to $69.01; Oracle eased 16 cents to $9.99.</TE>
<TE>   * Home builders' shares were hit by profit-taking. KB Home fell
$3.14 to 45.56, and Lennar lost $2.84 to $54.16.</TE>
<TE>   * Among blue chips, Boeing rose $1.11 to $40.87 after analysts at
Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank recommended the stock.</TE>
<TE>   * Discount retailer Target fell $1.82 to $34.62 after saying
weekly sales fell below its expectations. Other retail issues were
weak, including Wal-Mart, down $3.56 to $49.88 even after saying
healthy demand for household items and food has helped keep sales
within its July growth forecasts.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Release PC Safeguards</HD>
<DH>Computers: Software, security guidelines will be free to
all, mandated for some agencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D. IAN HOPPER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Creating a Good Housekeeping approval seal of sorts, the government
is releasing standards and a software program that will help computer
users configure their systems for maximum security against hackers
and thieves.</LD>
<LD>   The program will be available free to anyone and will be mandated
for some federal agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon, National Security Agency and other agencies will
join private partners today to announce the security standards for
computers that run Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 2000. The operating
system commonly is used by businesses and government.</LD>
<TE>   The seal of approval comes in the form of a small program that
probes computers for known security flaws and makes suggestions on
how to eliminate holes used by hackers.</TE>
<TE>   The unprecedented effort will have an immediate effect.</TE>
<TE>   All Defense Department computers will be required to meet the
standards immediately, and the White House is considering making the
rest of the government follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the keys to success will be extending the standards
to home and business users, making them simple enough for the public
to understand and ensuring they stay ahead of increasingly
sophisticated computer attackers.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's just government, it won't have as much value as if it's
government and the private sector," said Richard Clarke, President
Bush's computer security advisor.</TE>
<TE>   The private partners in the project have their eyes set on
broadening the standards to other operating systems, including the
Windows products most commonly used in home computers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a massive problem," said Clint Kreitner, head of the Center
for Internet Security, a nonprofit partnership of companies and U.S.
and Canadian government agencies. "They slap their systems on the Net
and get ready to go, then wonder why they get breached in the next 10
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   The effort has brought together some of the biggest names in
business, including computer chipmaker Intel Corp., Chevron and
Visa--part of the group that helped create the standards and is
encouraging their use.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft, which is embarking on its own efforts to make its
software more secure, has reviewed the standards and made
suggestions.</TE>

<HD>Brokerage Arbitration Suspended</HD>
<DH>Ethics: Two groups that settle investor disputes say
California's rules on conflict of interest are too burdensome.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The self-policing stock market groups that settle investor disputes
with brokers have quit providing such arbitration panels in
California, saying state ethical standards for arbitrators that took
effect July 1 are too burdensome.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Stock Exchange and the National Assn. of Securities
Dealers say they already require arbitrators to disclose any
professional, personal or business conflicts of interest.</LD>
<LD>   They contend the new state ethics rules are so complex that
arbitrators won't take the $400-a-day jobs, and that brokerages will
exploit the rules by challenging awards to investors on grounds that
arbitrators failed to meet the more stringent state requirements.</LD>
<TE>   The suspension of arbitration panels could create a backlog of
unresolved cases within months. The NYSE said it has more than 100
cases pending in California, only half of which have been assigned
arbitrators. About 300 NASD disputes so far have had the appointment
of arbitrators postponed, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   However, cases in which arbitrators were appointed before July 1
are proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerages have long insisted on avoiding the courts through
mandatory arbitration of investors' complaints, a policy upheld by
the U.S. Supreme Court. The cases typically are heard by three
arbitrators, one from the brokerage industry and two from outside it.
Some are decided by a single non-industry arbitrator.</TE>
<TE>   At its best, arbitration can provide a fast and relatively
inexpensive resolution of disputes. But critics complain the
industry's self-policing stacks the deck against investors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the illusion of oversight for the most part," said Cliff
Palefsky, a San Francisco-based civil rights lawyer active who helped
a state court panel develop the new ethics rules. "They run a forum
where they set the rules and already impose an industry member on the
panel," he said. "So the requirements of disclosure are more
important."</TE>
<TE>   The new rules result from a law sponsored by Martha Escutia, a
Whittier Democrat who heads the state Senate Judiciary Committee. It
was passed and signed into law by Gov. Gray Davis last year.</TE>
<TE>   The ethics rules, written by the Judicial Council of California,
apply to a wide range of arbitration processes, not just securities
cases.</TE>
<TE>   The rules expand the "duty of reasonable inquiry" arbitrators must
make to ensure that any actual or potential financial interest they
may have is disclosed. Among other things, arbitrators must determine
and disclose if "immediate family members" have in any way worked for
parties involved in disputes for two years prior.</TE>
<TE>   That requirement was too broad even for Philip M. Aidikoff, a
Beverly Hills attorney who represents investors in brokerage cases.
The new rules "may serve to scare good people off from serving who
just don't want to be bothered with this kind of search," Aidikoff
said.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE and NASD are lobbying state legislators to amend the law
to exempt them from its requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the
stock exchanges' arbitration programs, supports their request to be
exempted, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Escutia couldn't be reached for comment. Gene Wong, a legal
advisor to the judicial council, said the council had extended a
comment period on the new rules through September and would be
willing to make some changes to accommodate the NYSE and NASD.
However, the council doesn't have authority to grant a blanket
exemption, Wong said.</TE>

<HD>Disney Research Chief Joins U.S. Spy Agency</HD>
<DH>Technology: Eric Haseltine is leaving Imagineering unit for
a key post with NSA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Haseltine is moving from one top secret organization to another.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Disney Co.'s chief of research and development is leaving to
become head of research for the National Security Agency, which uses
sophisticated technology to gather intelligence, break codes and
protect sensitive government information systems.</LD>
<LD>   Haseltine worked for a decade at Walt Disney Imagineering, the
company's design and development group. As such, he would seem an
unlikely choice for his new government mission. But the worlds of the
NSA and Disney Imagineering aren't so dissimilar. Both include a
diverse group of top-level scientists and share a penchant for
security and secrecy (Disney won't say how many scientists it
employs). There's a certain institutional quality to the unmarked,
drab buildings that make up the sprawling Walt Disney Imagineering
complex in Glendale.</LD>
<TE>   Beyond developing innovative ride systems for theme parks,
Disney's research and development team also has expertise in areas
with military applications, including virtual reality technology.
Disney scientists are at the forefront of interactive TV and
developing systems for protecting the company against Internet
piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Haseltine, 50, who holds a doctorate in physiological psychology,
is no stranger to the defense world. He spent 13 years at Hughes
Aircraft Co., where he managed R&amp;D projects and was known as a top
expert on flight simulation. He joined Disney in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   In his new role, he will lead a research and technology team for
the spy agency, a division of the Defense Department. Neither NSA nor
Haseltine will detail his exact responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm particularly motivated because of what happened on Sept. 11,"
Haseltine said. "Under ordinary circumstances, I would never have
dreamed of leaving Disney, but these aren't ordinary circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, director of the NSA, said in
a statement that Haseltine "is the right leader to drive our R&amp;D area
to heightened technological superiority for national security."</TE>
<TE>   Disney has not yet named a replacement for Haseltine. "While we
never like to see someone of Eric's caliber leave," said Disney
spokeswoman Marie Garvey, "the company understands his desire to
serve his country."</TE>
<TE>   Haseltine led Disney's push into virtual reality entertainment,
which culminated in the DisneyQuest regional entertainment centers.
He also played a key role in bringing enhanced TV to ABC's "Monday
Night Football."</TE>
<TE>   He became head of research and development two years ago. He
starts his new job as the NSA's associate director of research Aug.
5.</TE>
<TE>   Haseltine is the latest among several senior scientists and
executives who have left the vaunted Walt Disney Imagineering
division in recent years, mostly to pursue Web-related ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was former research and development director Bran
Ferren, who recruited a number of top scientists to help Disney tap
the potential of the Internet. They included personal computer
pioneer Alan Kay and Marvin Minsky, one of the brains behind
artificial intelligence.</TE>

<HD>Deutsche Telekom CEO Is Forced Out of Office</HD>
<DH>Executives: Sommer resigns, elbowed aside by politics and
shareholders angry about the 90% drop in Germany's most widely held
stock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Deutsche Telekom chief Ron Sommer resigned Tuesday, driven out of one
of Germany's top executive posts by election-year politics and angry
shareholders who have watched the stock fall 90% from its peak.</LD>
<LD>   The telecommunications giant's supervisory board named former
Chairman Helmut Sihler interim chief executive. The 72-year-old
confirmed that his chief task would be to find a long-term solution
to the leadership problem.</LD>
<LD>   Pressure for Sommer's departure had been mounting for the last
week, after Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's ill-concealed lobbying for
a replacement who could halt the virtual free fall of Germany's most
widely held stock and Europe's biggest telecommunications network.</LD>
<TE>   But the government's preferred successor to Sommer, technology and
networks chief Gerd Tenzer, failed to win the board's approval
despite leaked reports last weekend that the 58-year-old would take
over.</TE>
<TE>   The succession battle could deal another blow to the electoral
fortunes of the incumbent chancellor, whose intervention in Telekom's
affairs has neither fulfilled the government's will nor silenced
those who accuse Schroeder of inaction.</TE>
<TE>   The German government is Telekom's largest shareholder, with a 43%
stake, after several share offerings transformed the former
state-owned post and communications monopoly into what was at its
prime the most highly capitalized company in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Telekom was worth more than $300 billion in 2000, but massive
spending to acquire U.S. mobile provider VoiceStream and
third-generation mobile phone licenses has pushed the company so
deeply into debt--$67 billion--that the bills now outweigh net worth.</TE>
<TE>   Telekom shares have plummeted from their March 2000 zenith of
103.50 euros to as low as 8.14 euros last month.</TE>
<TE>   News reports of Tenzer's impending appointment further upset
investors, who saw him as a status quo candidate unlikely to impose
the necessary belt tightening.</TE>
<TE>   The stock lost 15% of its value Monday, after rallying in previous
days on rumors that Sommer's head was about to roll. Telekom shares
rose 6% after Sommer's departure to close Tuesday on the Frankfurt
DAX stock exchange at 10.93 euros. One euro is worth about $1.</TE>
<TE>   Sihler, who made his name in the corporate world as head of the
Henkel chemical empire, told journalists he would emphasize
continuity and maintain Sommer's strategy to make Telekom a global
player, saying the company already is "on a good track."</TE>
<TE>   The public squabble about whether to fire Sommer made it clear
that the German government continues to wield considerable
influence--labor reform champions call it meddling--in the management
of privatized companies in which the state still holds a sizable
number of shares.</TE>
<TE>   That interventionist tradition and the prominent voice accorded
labor in German companies have perpetuated what analysts call
"Germany Inc.," or excessive state control over what should be the
private sector.</TE>
<TE>   At Telekom, as at all firms, unions and employee representatives
occupy at least half of the supervisory board positions and thus are
able to block efficiency moves when they threaten jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Sommer, 52, said he decided to step down to put a stop to the
damaging public debate over Telekom's future.</TE>
<TE>   "If a CEO in such a situation lacks the full confidence of the
board, resignation is the only possible step," a calm and
businesslike Sommer told a news conference at Telekom headquarters in
Bonn. "With this decision, I hope to make a contribution to avoiding
further damage to the company."</TE>
<TE>   Sommer will continue to draw his reported 2.5-million-euro annual
salary until his contract expires in 2005, but will depart without
any additional severance, Finance Minister Hans Eichel said.</TE>
<TE>   Politics so clearly intruded into the Telekom boardroom that the
company had a hard time finding someone to replace Sommer who could
win endorsement from the labor representatives on the board.
Economics Minister Werner Mueller, Volkswagen board Chairman
Ferdinand Piech and Klaus Mangold of DaimlerChrysler all turned down
the job, German newspapers have reported.</TE>
<TE>   Eichel, whose ministry is responsible for overseeing the
government's stock portfolio, at a late-night news conference here
denied that the closely contested federal election campaign had
anything to do with the push for Sommer's ouster. Telekom needed a
new direction after "the dramatic fall in share value and a very bad
credit rating," Eichel said.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder and his labor-friendly Social Democrats are trailing
conservative challenger Edmund Stoiber in the polls ahead of the
Sept. 22 vote, mainly because of the incumbent chancellor's failure
to deliver on a 1998 campaign promise to drastically reduce
double-digit unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   More than 4 million Germans are out of work--about the same as
four years ago when Schroeder said the number would fall to 3.5
million once his tax and pension reforms were enacted.</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber and his conservative colleagues have lambasted Schroeder
and Eichel for doing nothing to halt the losses suffered by 3 million
Telekom shareholders, many of them small and first-time investors
drawn to the telecom giant by a glitzy initial public offering
choreographed by Sommer in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Until the former state post monopoly was privatized, few Germans
risked their savings in the stock market, preferring instead to earn
meager but secure returns on passbook savings.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of Telekom shareholders and those holding other tech
stocks caught in a global slide has dealt a blow to efforts to make
Germans more responsible for planning for their retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Telekom last year posted its first annual loss since
privatization--3.5 billion euros in red ink. The tumble accelerated
in the first quarter of this year, with a 1.8-billion-euro loss.
Sommer still insisted the company would post at least 10% growth this
year and slash the debt by 20% by the end of 2003.</TE>

<HD>New Era Favors Only Toughest Competitors</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Greenspan in congressional testimony Tuesday, apart from
lamenting the threat of corruption in corporate America, also defined
this era for U.S. and world business.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a return of the boom, but it's not a continuing bust
either. It's a time in which U.S. companies may report narrower
profits, but gain in productivity and competitive- ness. Stock prices
are unlikely to shoot to the stars, but neither are they likely to
fall into a hole.</LD>
<LD>   It's a time, said the Federal Reserve chairman, when increasing
competition at home and in the global market place is "damping
pricing power across developed and developing nations alike."</LD>
<TE>   In a highly competitive world economy, it means even major
corporations are unable to unilaterally raise prices or exercise
control over their markets. That describes a tougher economic climate
that is both a threat and an opportunity for highly productive
American firms.</TE>
<TE>   Translated liberally, that explains why Dell Computer Corp.
Chairman Michael S. Dell announced last week that he is confident of
growing sales and earnings for his firm, but other companies in the
technology field are not so confident.</TE>
<TE>   It's a line that also explains why General Electric Co. Chairman
Jeffrey R. Immelt issued a bullish forecast last week, noting that
GE's plastics business is growing again and therefore he sees no sign
of the economy dipping back into recession.</TE>
<TE>   Dell is confident because his company, which he founded when he
was an 18-year-old student at the University of Texas, is the
low-cost producer of computers, servers, information storage
equipment and other devices.</TE>
<TE>   Dell Computer is low-cost because it doesn't dwell on unique
technology but on its ability to deliver products at prices that beat
the competition. At Allen &amp; Co.'s gathering of communications and
technology top executives last week in Sun Valley, Idaho, Michael
Dell boasted that his company's gross pretax profit margin--sales
revenue minus costs of goods sold, the broadest measure of
profit--was only 17.6%. Four years ago, in the technology boom, that
margin was 22%.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the 36-year-old entrepreneur was boasting because his company
is not only surviving the technol- ogy downturn but expanding by
taking business from other firms in the brutally competitive world
marketplace. In the fiscal year ended in February, Dell Com-</TE>
<TE>   puter had $31.2 billion in sales. Four years ago it had $12.3
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the technology bust, companies of all kinds need computers
and other information technology gear to reduce costs and boost
output--thereby increasing productivity.</TE>
<TE>   Other firms are trying to define which way technology is going,
says Richard Bernstein, investment strategist for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
"But Dell basically knows that everything in technology is becoming a
commodity and it's the low-cost producer who wins in a commodity
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Information technology is the cornerstone of U.S. companies'
efforts to become efficient and competitive. Greenspan noted that the
"productivity of the U.S. economy has continued to rise at a
remarkably strong pace"--close to 7% so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   Part of those gains were achieved by companies holding back on
hiring while boosting output with the same or fewer workers,
Greenspan conceded, but "benefits from the rapid pace of
technological advances" also played a crucial role.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan forecast an economy expanding at about 3.5% this year, a
pace that could add almost $400 billion in output of goods and
services. That's not rapid growth following a recession but not a
slowdown either.</TE>
<TE>   One proxy for the economy is GE's plastics business, which
supplies basic materials for car bodies, electronic parts and medical
devices. "I see plastics as a basic indicator of the economy's downs
and ups," said Immelt, who came up through that $6.8-billion sales
division, as did his prede- cessor, Jack Welch.</TE>
<TE>   What GE and Dell and Greenspan's testimony to Congress point to is
an economy plowing out gains in sales and profits in basic industries
by dint of tough competitive tactics and strict cost controls.</TE>
<TE>   Companies will be hard pressed to increase profits dramatically.
The stock market's decline is an adjustment to that prospect.
Investors are reducing the premiums still attached to many company's
shares, but still rewarding efficient and successful companies, such
as Dell.</TE>
<TE>   It's a recovering economy that is being greeted with more
determination than enthusiasm across most of U.S. and global
industry. And that's just about the right perspective for this new
era.</TE>

<HD>Bids May Help Global Emerge From Chapter 11</HD>
<DH>Telecom: CEO Legere is encouraged by the firm's efforts to
reorganize without massive aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executives at Global Crossing Ltd. said Tuesday that with bids for
the company in hand, the worldwide fiber-optic network builder can
soon emerge from bankruptcy protection as a strong player in the
increasingly battered telecommunications industry.</LD>
<LD>   John Legere, the company's chief executive, said in an interview
that he was encouraged by bids submitted Thursday as well as by the
company's effort to establish itself as a viable operation that can
survive without massive financial aid.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got multiple ways to restructure this company," Legere
said. "Anybody who thinks we're having a fire sale on these assets or
that we would take any number just to move this company forward is
sadly mistaken."</LD>
<TE>   He acknowledged that a number of potential bidders dropped out in
the last month as problems in the industry deepened with the woes at
WorldCom Inc., the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier that
overstated revenue by $3.9 billion over five quarters, and at Qwest
Communications International Inc. But, he said, a few bidders
surfaced with the prospect of investing in an industry that will
probably have fewer competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The company has been going over offers with a creditors committee
and a bankers' group, which together are owed $8 billion. The two
groups will decide which bid, if any, it will accept. They also could
look at results of the company's negotiations with bidders to boost
offers or to work together for a higher return, Legere said.</TE>
<TE>   There are possibly three bidders for the entire company, including
a joint offer from two Los Angeles buyout firms run by brothers Tom
and Alec Gores, and a handful looking to pick up parts of a system
connecting 200 cities in 27 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Legere refused to disclose the names, the number of bidders or
other details.</TE>
<TE>   "The process is designed for those parties that mostly want to
look at substantially all the assets of the ongoing franchise,"
Legere said. "That's where maximum return is going to be for the
creditors and the banks."</TE>
<TE>   In a fluid process loosely resembling an auction, a winning bidder
will be determined next Wednesday, though Global Crossing can change
the date. A court hearing to approve the winning bid and possibly
hear objections was delayed from July 30 to Aug. 7.</TE>

<HD>Strong U.S. Sales Lift GM Income</HD>
<DH>Autos: Car maker earns $1.5 billion in quarter, beating
expectations and doubling results from a year earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Riding strong U.S. sales and aggressive cost management, General
Motors Corp. said Tuesday that it beat expectations and earned an
operating profit of $1.5 billion, or $2.63 a share. The results were
about twice those of last year's second quarter, when GM earned $766
million, or $1.37 per share.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue for the quarter was $48.3 billion, up from $46.2 billion a
year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   GM continues to outpace its Detroit rivals, Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group, both of which lost money last year
and last quarter on a net basis. Its well-received truck lineup has
added to GM's image and its bottom line, whereas Ford, which lost
$5.45 billion last year, and Chrysler Group are in the midst of
wide-ranging restructuring programs that are limiting their product
offerings. Ford and DaimlerChrysler also will report their earnings
this week.</LD>
<TE>   On a net basis, GM earned $1.3 billion, or $2.43 a share,
including its El Segundo-based subsidiary Hughes Electronics, which
is being bought by EchoStar Communications Corp., and took a
$55-million charge for costs associated with end-of-life vehicle
recycling in Europe. GM's net earnings a year ago were $477 million,
or $1.03 a share.</TE>
<TE>   "The second-quarter results show that our strategy of bringing out
great products, being aggressive in the marketplace and intensely
focusing on reducing costs and improving quality is working," Chief
Executive Rick Wagoner said in a statement. "Because of our improved
cost base, we are able to be competitive with our pricing and improve
our financial performance at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   The world's No. 1 auto maker also continued to increase its U.S.
market share in the second quarter, climbing to 28.2% from 27.3% a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   GM's results beat Wall Street's consensus, which had put earnings
per share for the quarter at $2.42.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings per share were "a bit better than expected and cash flow
very strong," said John Casesa, Merrill Lynch's auto industry
analyst, in a research note to clients. "GM is a complicated story,
but earnings and cash are coming through and the stock is
attractively valued."</TE>
<TE>   GM's shares closed at $45.84, down $2.08 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer John Devine reiterated GM's forecast of
earning $6 per share for the full year, currently estimated at $6.05
by Casesa and $5.57 by analyst Steven Girsky of Morgan Stanley.</TE>
<TE>   GM's North American income more than doubled to $1.2 billion
thanks to strong sales led by GM's recently introduced line of
mid-size sport utility vehicles such as the Chevrolet TrailBlazer and
Saturn VUE, along with the Cadillac CTS sedan and Pontiac Vibe wagon,
and traditionally strong pickup trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "GM's North American operations continue to perform well," Girsky
said. "Industry conditions, however, at the margin appear to be
slipping. International operations continue to struggle."</TE>
<TE>   GM will probably take a "significant" third-quarter charge on its
20% in Italy's Fiat Auto because of a sharp decline in European auto
sales, CFO Devine said.</TE>
<TE>   The deal struck two years ago allows Fiat the option of forcing GM
to purchase loss-generating Fiat Auto from 2004 to 2009. Devine said
that process would take nine to 12 months if it happened, but that GM
was not seeking to take over Fiat Auto, which includes the Fiat, Alfa
Romeo and Lancia brands.</TE>
<TE>   Devine said GM needs to take the lead in luring American consumers
to its showrooms, and hence announced a revival this month of
no-interest loans for up to five years, deals introduced after the
Sept. 11 attacks to get people buying cars and trucks after sales
nose dived. "We like it, and that's why we do it," Devine said. "We
can improve our profitability while remaining aggressive in the
marketplace."</TE>

<HD>Intel to Cut 4,000 Jobs in a Limp PC Market</HD>
<DH>Semiconductors: The company reports a profit of $446
million in the second quarter. The results barely meet Wall Street's
reduced expectations.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp., still reeling from one of the chip industry's worst
downturns, on Tuesday posted anemic earnings and announced it would
cut 4,000 jobs, or about 5% of its work force, by the end of the
year.</LD>
<LD>   The cut, on top of 7,000 jobs eliminated last year, suggests the
worst is not over for the world's largest semiconductor maker.</LD>
<LD>   "We were hoping to see the beginnings of an economic recovery,"
said Intel Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant. "We haven't seen it."</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Craig Barrett announced the job cuts--which will
include attrition and voluntary buyouts as well as layoffs--to Intel
employees. The company, which has traditionally avoided large-scale
staff reductions, has about 20,000 more employees than it did in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from a dismal 2001, Intel had joined numerous industry
analysts in projecting a rebound in the second half of the year. But
corporations have been reluctant to upgrade their computers. Intel,
whose chips run eight out of 10 personal computers, relies on the
strength of the PC market, which continues to sag.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning of the year, they thought there would be a
pickup in spending [on information technology] in the second half of
the year," said David Wu, vice president of research for Wedbush
Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "Now we're in the second half, and
it doesn't look like it's happening."</TE>
<TE>   Intel said revenue for the second quarter ended June 29 was $6.3
billion, down 7% from the first quarter and even with sales from the
second quarter last year. Net income was $446 million in the second
quarter, off 52% from the first quarter but up 127% from last year,
when revenue and profit fell sharply.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings per share, including the cost of acquiring new
businesses, was 7 cents, up from 3 cents the same quarter last year
but down from 13 cents a share in the first quarter. Excluding the
acquisition costs, earnings were 9 cents a share, down 33% from last
year and off 40% from the first quarter. The results, released after
the close of the stock market, barely met Wall Street's reduced
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Intel shares fell 76 cents, or 4%, to $18.36 on Nasdaq in regular
trading, then rose to $18.60 in after-hours trading, after the
earnings report.</TE>
<TE>   Intel, which now has 83,000 employees, said the cuts eventually
would save Intel "hundreds of millions of dollars" a year.</TE>
<TE>   But the move is viewed as a temporary fix.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just buying themselves a little more time for the tide to
come in, and that tide is ... renewed spending," Wu said, who
estimates that companies next year will start to replace their old
computers, many purchased in 1999 in anticipation of the so-called
Y2K bug.</TE>
<TE>   Although companies have typically waited three years to replace
old machines, many are deciding to hold off even longer.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of our clients in nonprofit, education and even government
are looking to kick the machine out five, six and possibly seven
years if they can do it," said Mark Margevicius, a research director
at Gartner Inc. "Obviously that's not good news for Intel."</TE>
<TE>   With PC sales flagging, Intel has pared back businesses that
executives deem unimportant to the company's core expertise in
semiconductors. For example, Intel this year stopped making toys and
digital music players, and is phasing out its Web hosting business.
At the same time, the chip giant has been trying to reduce its
reliance on PCs by expanding its semiconductor offerings in other
industries, such as cellular phones and mobile devices.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing Intel does that is wrong," Margevicius said. "In
fact, I like what they're doing--getting back to silicon as their
predominant focus."</TE>

<HD>Mitsubishi Motors to Merge North American Divisions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN OHNSMAN</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said Tuesday that it would combine North
American production and sales units into a single company to give
local managers more influence in developing and selling cars and
trucks.</LD>
<LD>   Starting early next year, the new company, Mitsubishi Motors North
America, based in Cypress, will manage sales, Mitsubishi's plant in
Normal, Ill., its finance company and the U.S. research and
development unit, said Steve Torok, Mitsubishi's executive vice
president.</LD>
<LD>   No jobs will be cut, he said. He didn't provide costs or expected
savings from the move.</LD>
<TE>   Tokyo-based Mitsubishi, which is 37% owned by DaimlerChrysler, has
increased sales in North America as demand falls in Japan. Japanese
sales of Mitsubishi passenger cars and light trucks slid 13% to
221,950 this year through June, while U.S. sales rose 13% to 173,590
in the same period. The eighth-largest auto maker in the U.S. expects
sales of 350,000 for all of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Among the Asian brands they're still a second-tier company," said
Dennis Virag, president of Automotive Consulting Group Inc. "They
have to keep improving product quality and image, and that's going to
take time."</TE>
<TE>   The company announced the consolidation Tuesday at a meeting with
Mitsubishi dealers in Las Vegas. Pierre Gagnon, president and chief
operating officer of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, will be
president and chief executive of the new company.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for Mitsubishi to move up to the next level of
operations in North America," Torok said.</TE>
<TE>   No other Asian or European auto maker has integrated all North
American operations into a single company. Mitsubishi's move is aimed
at helping it respond faster to changes in consumer preferences.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization also suggests that traditional management
practices in Japan are evolving, said William Ouchi, a professor at
UCLA's Anderson School. "Management has been loath to give up control
to regional units," Ouchi said. "This may be a cutting of the apron
strings at Mitsubishi."</TE>

<HD>FCC Extends Deadline to Keep Cell Numbers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sparing the wireless industry another brutal round of price wars,
federal regulators gave carriers a year before they must permit
customers to keep their number when switching mobile-phone providers.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's decision by the Federal Communications Commission
angered consumer groups and was a victory for Sprint PCS, Verizon
Wireless and other carriers.</LD>
<LD>   They lobbied hard against so-called number portability out of fear
that the technology would allow bargain hunting cell-phone
subscribers to more easily jump ship if they aren't faced with the
inconvenience of having to switch phone numbers.</LD>
<TE>   "There are a number of ways to keep customers and I suppose
inconvenience is one that has proven effective," said Adam Zawel, a
wireless analyst at the Yankee Group consulting firm in Cambridge,
Mass. But carriers, he added, will have to find other ways to hold
onto their customers, because "even if there is a minor increase in"
customer defections "the loss to carriers will be huge."</TE>
<TE>   The FCC ruling marked the third time the agency extended the
number portability deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC originally ordered mobile-phone companies to provide the
technology after Congress mandated it in 1996 for traditional phone
carriers serving homes and businesses. Wireless companies were first
supposed to implement it in June 1999. Now they must install the
equipment, which routes wireless calls through a special database
that keeps track of assigned numbers, by Nov. 24, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC decision angered some consumer advocates who say the
repeated delays thwart competition and hurt consumer choice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the height of hypocrisy for the ... FCC--amid all of the
rhetoric about making markets work--preventing consumers from
shopping around for the best wireless plan and the lowest price while
keeping their phone number," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the
Washington office of Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer
Reports magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's decision was sparked by a petition filed by Verizon
Wireless to eliminate the number portability requirement. In a
compromise, the four FCC commissioners declined to drop the number
portability requirement but delayed its implementation for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers and carriers blanketed the FCC with nearly 700 comments
on the number portability issue over the last year. The agency said
the majority of the comments were from wireless consumers.</TE>

<HD>Nextel Posts Its First Profit as Sales Climb</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The company surprises investors with its
second-quarter report and boosts share prices for wireless carriers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wireless provider Nextel Communications Inc. provided a rare dose of
good news for the telecommunications industry Tuesday, surprising
investors with its first quarterly profit and a higher full-year
earnings estimate.</LD>
<LD>   Nextel's second-quarter report sparked a 31% jump in the company's
stock and elevated wireless stocks in general, boosting the shares of
AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. and Leap Wireless Inc.</LD>
<LD>   On Nasdaq, Nextel shares rose $1.53 to $6.53, and Leap was up 37
cents to $1.50. Shares of AT&amp;T Wireless rose 20 cents to $6.20 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Reston, Va.-based Nextel, the nation's fifth-largest wireless
carrier, said sales rose 25% with the addition of 471,000 customers
to its network, bringing the total to 9.64 million in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised ....The numbers look great," said Zach Wagner,
wireless analyst at Edward Jones. "I think they've probably stolen a
lot of customers from the other carriers."</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the number of mobile phone customers has grown so much
that adding customers has gotten much tougher for wireless companies
in the last few quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said it is unclear whether Nextel's strong customer
growth will be mirrored at other national carriers when they report
their quarterly numbers over the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel has long been the smallest of the nationwide wireless
carriers, but the 15-year-old company has a base of customers
attracted by Nextel's focus on business users and its unique
walkie-talkie capability. That feature, called Direct Connect, is
particularly popular with construction crews, sales employees and
others.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel reported net income of $123 million for the quarter, a
sharp turnaround from a loss of $369 million for the same quarter in
2001. Sales rose to $2.15 billion from $1.72 billion.</TE>
<TE>   After accounting for a gain on redeemed preferred stock and the
payment of preferred dividends, Nextel posted net income attributable
to common stockholders of $325 million, or 37 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $426 million, or 56 cents, for the same period last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials said they expect 2002 operating cash
flow--earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization--of at least $3 billion, up from an earlier forecast of
$2.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel, which is controlled by billionaire Craig McCaw, reported
progress in reducing its domestic long-term debt, which totaled more
than $13 billion on June 30.</TE>
<TE>   During the quarter, Nextel exchanged $1.1 billion in debt and
preferred stock for 61 million shares of common stock and $295
million in cash. It said it would spend $205 million to buy back $400
million of its debt. The moves will save Nextel about $2.5 billion
over nine years in interest, principal and dividend payments.</TE>
<TE>   "They've always had a very good business model," said Wagner of
Edward James, who doesn't own Nextel shares and rates them as "sell."
"But still, they've got a wall of debt coming due in 2007, and it's
going to be a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Wall Street seems content to ride the bit of favorable
news that Nextel provided Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>RadioShack to Settle Managers' Overtime Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Labor: Company will pay $29.9 million in one of the largest
such agreements in the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>RadioShack Corp. said Tuesday that it would pay $29.9 million to
settle the unpaid overtime claims of 1,300 managers in California in
one of the largest such agreements in the short history of the
state's white-collar wage litigation wave.</LD>
<LD>   The managers filed a class-action overtime lawsuit more than two
years ago, contending that the Fort Worth-based company had
improperly exempted them from overtime eligibility. RadioShack made
no admission of wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement but is
working on a plan for court approval to change the way it pays
managers.</LD>
<LD>   Under California's unique wage law, workers classified as managers
are eligible for overtime pay at time and a half if they spend more
than 50% of their time on nonsupervisory tasks such as running a cash
register, flipping burgers or unloading merchandise.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of firms have paid out hundreds of millions of dollars in
settlements in such cases filed over the last five years.
RadioShack's deal appears to be the second-largest, behind a SBC
Pacific Bell settlement in December to pay 1,500 engineers $35
million. In April, Starbucks Corp. agreed to pay $18 million to
settle overtime claims by 1,000 managers and assistants.</TE>
<TE>   Employment lawyers said they believe that the litigation may have
peaked because most of the large national firms with potential
vulnerability have been sued.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be these suits are on a downhill slope in terms of numbers
and size," said Frank Cronin, an Irvine-based employment lawyer who
has defended management in a handful of such suits. "There's a lot of
medium and small companies that might become targets of the
plaintiffs' bar, but they have pretty much focused on the big,
name-brand companies with deep pockets."</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Zieff, a San Francisco lawyer who won a $90-million
verdict on behalf of 2,400 Farmers Insurance claims adjusters in an
overtime case, said he believes there are plenty of companies that
are failing to pay overtime that they owe to supervisory workers.
"The litigation and the publicity that's attended it has probably put
a lot of employers on notice, so they are hopefully cleaning up their
act," he said. "But I'm sure the practice still exists and will
continue."</TE>
<TE>   Employers are encouraged by a recent appellate decision in a case
involving Sav-on drugstores. The court ruled that store managers did
not qualify as a class. From store to store, the court held, managers
spent their time in such different ways that there was not enough
similarity to treat them all the same in a mass trial or settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Labor lawyers said the ruling has limited applicability to other
cases and believe it has a good chance of being overturned. But, if
it stands, the decision will "have a chilling effect on this kind of
litigation," said Robert Thompson, a Tustin lawyer who has
represented workers in several overtime suits, including RadioShack.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sav-on ruling, RadioShack asked the Orange County judge
overseeing its case to disband the class of managers. The judge
declined, and RadioShack settled the case while its appeal was
pending.</TE>
<TE>   The class includes current and former managers at 550 large-volume
stores in California, Thompson said. Payments depend on how many
weeks claimants worked as managers in those stores since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   RadioShack general counsel Mark Hill said the company
was encouraged by the Sav-on decision, but he said RadioShack wanted
to put the dispute behind it, and the settlement of a separate,
unrelated lawsuit in its favor freed up $27.7 million in cash.</TE>

<LD>A San Diego judge slashed by two-thirds a record $30.6-million jury
award to six women who charged Ralphs Grocery Co. with covering up
the behavior of a store director who sexually harassed them at
several supermarkets, lawyers said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The women--four cashiers, a bookkeeper and a bakery manager--were
awarded $5 million each in punitive damages, plus a total of $550,000
for pain and suffering at the conclusion of a five-week trial in
April.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to a motion by Ralphs, Superior Court Judge Michael M.
Anello held a hearing on the jury's verdict June 28 and issued his
decision late Monday. In it, Anello said the award was excessive and
grounds for a new trial. Anello said an award of $8.8 million was
more appropriate.</LD>
<TE>   "He gutted" the jury award, said Larry Organ, a San Francisco
lawyer representing the women. "He is basically saying, 'If you don't
accept a $21.75-million reduction in the verdict, I will grant
Ralphs' new-trial motion. And you will have to try the case again.' "</TE>
<TE>   The trial was the second for the case. Four years earlier, the
women won a $3.8-million verdict, which was thrown out because of
jury misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Organ said his clients had not decided how to respond to the
judge's order. Ralphs, a unit of Cincinnati-based Kroger Co., had no
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Kroger closed down 40 cents to $19.35 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not uncommon for trial judges and appellate courts
to scale back jury awards, foreman John Adair was outraged. "This is
a travesty for the civil rights of people in our community," he said,
referring to the plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   Adair also said he believes such rulings make a mockery of the
jury system. "The jury process has been disgraced once again," he
said. "It discourages the process of jury duty because all we're
doing is sitting in to offer opinions. They can take polls to gather
opinions. They don't have to pull people out of their workplaces to
gather opinions."</TE>
<TE>   The jury award was a record in the aggregate in a sexual
harassment case, but on a per-plaintiff basis others have won larger
verdicts in California, which does not cap such damages.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Caterpillar Inc. said second-quarter net income fell 26%, far below
estimates, and lowered its estimate for full-year profit because of
declining spending on bulldozers and backhoes.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the No. 1 maker of earthmoving equipment fell 4.9% after
the company said net income fell to $200 million, or 58 cents a
share, from $271 million, or 78 cents, in the year-earlier quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Sales fell 3.6% to $5.29 billion as customers rent instead of buy
because they aren't confident about the economy and financing isn't
readily available, Caterpillar said.</LD>
<TE>   Full-year profit will be about 15% less than 2001, excluding
certain costs from last year, or $2.21 a share, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Caterpillar shares fell $2.19 to $43.00 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Duke Energy Corp., under investigation for possible sham energy
transactions, said 23 "round-trip" trades on the Intercontinental
Exchange's Internet market added $126 million to 2001 revenue and
didn't affect profit.</LD>
<LD>   The trades accounted for a quarter of a percent of $51.4 billion
in revenue from natural gas and power trading last year, Duke said,
responding to an informal request for data from the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The 23 trades weren't in the West, Duke said.</LD>

<HD>Motorola Reports Loss of $2.3 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorola Inc. said Tuesday that it suffered a record net loss of $2.3
billion in the second quarter, pummeled by $3.4 billion in special
charges related mostly to a restructuring of its computer chip-making
division. It was the company's sixth consecutive unprofitable
quarter. The loss nearly doubled its previous worst of $1.3 billion
in the third quarter of 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Yet in a positive sign amid all the red ink, the long-slumping
tech giant said it had posted a $48-million profit excluding the long
list of special items. That enabled it to easily exceed Wall Street's
expectations and proclaim a return to profitability one quarter
earlier than previously expected.</LD>
<LD>   Shares in the Schaumburg, Ill.-based company rose 69 cents to
$14.53 on the New York Stock Exchange before the report was released.</LD>
<TE>   Motorola's loss amounted to $1.02 a share, compared with a loss of
$759 million, or 35 cents a share, for the second quarter a year
earlier. Sales declined 11% to $6.74 billion from $7.49 billion as
the weakened global economy continued to pressure its two main
businesses: cell phones and semiconductors.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola announced last month that it would take the huge charges,
mostly noncash write-downs to reflect the declining market value of
factories and investments. It also said it would cut an additional
7,000 jobs, continuing a nearly two-year shrinking process that has
slashed its work force from a peak of 150,000 in August 2000 to a
planned 93,000.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola said sales rose 5% to $2.6 billion in its No. 1 business,
cell phones, which it attributed to new handsets that recently have
hit the market.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Apple Computer Inc. reported a slide in quarterly earnings and
revenue, a blow to the financial recovery it began last year. The
personal computer maker blamed the decline on market weakness, which
also has affected its rivals. Earnings fell to $32 million, or 9
cents a share, in its fiscal third quarter, from $61 million, or 17
cents a diluted share, a year earlier and $40 million, or 11 cents a
share, in the previous quarter. Sales were $1.43 billion, compared
with $1.48 billion a year earlier and $1.5 billion in the previous
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * RealNetworks Inc. said its second-quarter net loss narrowed from
a year earlier as revenue fell because of weak sales to corporate
customers. The maker of software to send and receive audiovisual
content over the Internet said its net loss was $1.6 million, or 1
cent a share, compared with a loss of $19.2 million, or 12 cents, a
year earlier. Revenue slipped to $43.8 million from $47.9 million a
year earlier, in the middle of its expectations of $42.5 million to
$45 million.</TE>
<TE>   * No. 3 independent video game publisher THQ Inc. reported a
smaller profit for the second quarter, brought down by a charge for a
failed venture in Britain. THQ posted a profit of $2.3 million, or 5
cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $3.5 million,
or 10 cents. Revenue in the quarter was $85.8 million, compared with
$55.2 million in the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   * Telephone &amp; Data Systems Inc., which sells local phone service
primarily in the Midwest, had a second-quarter loss of $947.9 million
as it wrote down the value of some investments. On a per-share basis,
the loss amounted to $16.17, compared with a loss of $339.7 million,
or $5.79, a year earlier. Per-share figures include preferred
dividends. Sales rose 13% to $723.8 million from $642.3 million.
Results include U.S. Cellular Corp., TDS' majority-owned wireless
unit.</TE>

<HD>Ford, Bridgestone Settle Case Just Before Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: The lawsuit, brought by the family of two people
killed when their Explorer rolled over, would have been the first
tried against the firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A closely watched case that would have been the first tried against
Ford Motor Co. and Bridgestone/Firestone instead ended in an
out-of-court settlement in Los Angeles on Tuesday, just before the
trial was to begin.</LD>
<LD>   Ford and Firestone have reached undisclosed settlements in more
than 600 cases nationwide, without one being tried to a verdict. On
Tuesday morning, when Randy Barnhart, a Denver plaintiffs' lawyer,
announced that the Los Angeles case had been settled, keeping the
record intact, Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Mohr quipped, "Why am
I not surprised?"</LD>
<LD>   The case was filed by the family of Garry Meek, 56, and his
granddaughter Amy Meek, 13, of Visalia, Calif., who died in August
2000 on their way home from a camping trip when a tire blew and their
Ford Explorer flipped over in Wyoming.</LD>
<TE>   Jeanette Meek, wife and grandmother of the victims, and four other
members of the family were in court Tuesday but left without speaking
to the media. Citing the confidentiality agreement, Barnhart would
say only they settled for a substantial sum.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most of the other cases, the Meek suit went to the brink of
a trial. The lawyers had spent 3 1/2 days picking 12 jurors and, to
ensure completion of a two-month trial, a large panel of eight
alternates. The lawyers were to begin their opening statements
Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Mohr also was told Tuesday that the next case scheduled for trial,
Logan vs. Ford, had been settled too.</TE>
<TE>   About 270 people reportedly died and an additional 800 were
injured when Explorers rolled over after the treads separated on
their Firestone tires. There were about 75 more deaths reported
abroad, including in Venezuela, Colombia and Saudi Arabia. Beginning
in August 2000, about 20 million tires were recalled, making it one
of the largest defective-product scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, more than 1,000 death and injury claims were filed,
which the companies are busy settling. Among them were more than 150
California suits and about 200 involving foreign victims of rollover
wrecks.</TE>
<TE>   If the companies were going to make a stand in court, some
observers thought they might make it in the Meek case because of what
they considered to be favorable facts.</TE>
<TE>   According to the defense, the tire that came apart on the Meeks'
Explorer had 68,000 miles on it and had been patched three times for
punctures. Poor repairs, not a defect, caused it to fail, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased we were able to settle the case," said Warren
E. Platt, a lawyer for Ford. "We try to resolve as many of the cases
as we can, because it's in the best interests of the customer and the
company."</TE>
<TE>   The deal was announced as Mohr was preparing to rule on whether
jurors would be allowed to see internal memos suggesting that
Firestone and Ford deliberately withheld information from U.S. safety
regulators about fatal accidents in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Firestone had sought to exclude the March 1999 memos in which Ford
and Firestone executives discussed whether to offer replacement tires
to Saudi owners of Explorers outfitted with Firestones after several
reports of tire failures and rollover wrecks.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the memos, Ford executive Charles Seilnacht said
Firestone had "major reservations about the plan to notify
customers.... First, they feel that the U.S. D.O.T. [Department of
Transportation] will have to be notified of the program since the
same product is sold in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Seilnacht added that a lawyer in Ford's office of general counsel
also "was concerned about the implications of the owner letter,"
similar to the Firestone concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Ford eventually offered replacement tires to Saudi customers, but
without notifying U.S. traffic safety officials. Amid mounting
reports of similar wrecks in the U.S., the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration opened an investigation in May 2000 that led to
the tire recall.</TE>
<TE>   In fighting to admit the evidence, the Meeks' lawyers described
the memos as a "smoking gun" and direct evidence that the companies
concealed the failures from NHTSA to avoid a recall in the United
States at an additional cost in lives.</TE>
<TE>   Although vehicle and tire makers are required to report
safety-related problems, the companies later said at congressional
hearings that they did not believe a tire problem in the Middle East
indicated a safety problem in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation passed in the wake of the recall requires companies to
report safety-related incidents that occur outside the U.S.</TE>

<HD>UPS and Union Agree to Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A relieved United Parcel Service Inc. and the Teamsters union
announced a tentative six-year contract deal Tuesday that raises
employee pay and benefits by about 4% a year while eliminating the
threat of a costly strike.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it sets the bar pretty high for contracts around the
country, and that's what we set out to do," said Ken Hall, lead
negotiator for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which
represents about 210,000 UPS workers.</LD>
<LD>   Pay for full-time drivers would increase from $23.11 an hour to
$28.11 over the six years, and their benefits package would grow by
$3.75 an hour.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement, which still must be ratified by members, followed a
weekend of intense negotiations that brought the parties from near
impasse to a deal that seemed to satisfy everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement is good for our customers, good for employees and
good for our company," UPS Chairman and Chief Executive Michael L.
Eskew said in a statement. "And it enables UPS to remain strong in a
very competitive industry, with the added stability of a six-year
contract."</TE>
<TE>   The company also agreed to convert 2,500 part-time jobs to
full-time during each of the final four years of the contract, and to
raise part-time pay an additional $1 an hour over the contract, Hall
said. Part-time employees, who make up more than half of the
company's work force, now earn an average of $11 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes were high for both sides. UPS was determined to avoid a
repeat of the 15-day strike in 1997 that alienated customers and cost
the company an estimated $750 million. As the July 31 deadline
neared, the company began to see skittish business owners already
moving packages to other carriers, leading to a 4% drop in volume
last month from the previous June.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a wake-up call for both of us," said Norman Black, a
spokesman for the Atlanta-based company. The announcement of lost
business persuaded negotiators to work through the weekend, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the union side, Teamsters President James P. Hoffa needed to
show members he could negotiate as good a deal, or better, than his
predecessor and former political rival, Ron Carey.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffa adopted a tough negotiating slogan--"Whatever it takes"--and
staged an early strike-authorization vote. Hoffa, who oversees a
1.4-million-member union, sat in on talks during the final three
days.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, both sides were able to say they got what they wanted.
The Teamsters said the contract brings members an additional $9
billion over the six-year term, compared with the $4.5 billion added
under the five-year contract negotiated by Carey.</TE>
<TE>   By settling two weeks before the current contract expires, and
setting the contract term at six years rather than five, UPS can
assure its customers of a long stretch of uninterrupted service. "We
were able to show them that 1997 was an aberration," Black said, "and
it wasn't going to happen again."</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Lenders May Extend $2 Billion</HD>
<DH>Telecom: J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and GE submit proposals for
financing that would allow continued phone and Internet service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. has arranged to get as much as $2 billion from lenders
to continue operating during a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, people
familiar with the situation said.</LD>
<LD>   J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigroup Inc. and General Electric Co.'s
GE Capital unit have submitted proposals for so-called
debtor-in-possession financing that would allow WorldCom to continue
providing telephone, Internet and data services while under
bankruptcy protection, the people said. The lenders agreed to provide
$1 billion to $2 billion, these people said.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom needs to secure the funds as lenders attempt to freeze
assets, investors sue to recover losses and customers take their
business to other carriers. The financing indicates that, as
WorldCom's finances deteriorate, the company is considering a Chapter
11 filing soon, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael
K. Powell reiterated his view that WorldCom phone service probably
would not be disrupted. He moved to distance himself from a previous
interview in which he appeared to suggest that the FCC might change
its policy and consider a takeover of WorldCom by a regional Bell
local phone company.</TE>
<TE>   "This ... is not a dramatic change in policy to simply state that
the commission would entertain a transaction of a local company and
long distance company if it was proposed," Powell said. "I know of no
legal doctrine or document by which we could refuse to review any
merger that somebody proposed.... I do think we would have an acute
eye on the concerns of continuing operations if such a transaction
were to occur. But by no means did I mean to suggest that this was a
very dramatic shift in policy."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has more than $30 billion in debt and is trimming 17,000
jobs and trying to sell assets to raise money. Last week, WorldCom
said it wouldn't pay a 60-cent-a-share dividend on MCI Group stock to
save $71 million. WorldCom had $2.3 billion in cash March 31. On
Monday, the company missed interest payments on its bonds, saving $74
million.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is suing WorldCom for fraud
and, along with the Justice Department, investigating the company's
accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, the Clinton, Miss.-based company sued its
former controller to recoup the nearly $800,000 paid two years ago to
retain his services. The company filed suit Monday in Hinds County

<HD>Raytheon Faces SEC Charge on Disclosure</HD>
<DH>Securities: Firm is accused of giving profit forecasts to
analysts before the public. Sides are in settlement talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raytheon Co. will be charged by the Securities and Exchange
Commission with giving profit forecasts to stock analysts in 2001
before telling the public, in the agency's first case to enforce
Regulation Fair Disclosure, people familiar with the matter said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Raytheon would not pay a fine or admit guilt in a settlement under
discussion between the SEC and the fourth-biggest U.S. defense
contractor, people close to the case said. The settlement calls for
Raytheon to be subject to tougher sanctions if the company breaks the
rule again, they said.</LD>
<LD>   The potential settlement comes nearly two years after the SEC
enacted the fair-disclosure rule, which bars companies from
selectively disclosing market-moving news before publicly announcing
it.</LD>
<TE>   Some securities lawyers said the SEC isn't pushing for a stiff
penalty in enforcing the rule, which was opposed by SEC Chairman
Harvey L. Pitt when he represented brokerages as a private lawyer,
before his appointment to the SEC last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a slow reaction on the SEC's part, and a very mild reaction,
but it's probably intended as a first-time reminder to U.S.
companies, which are largely complying with the rule," Southern
Methodist University law professor Alan Bromberg said.</TE>
<TE>   David Polk, a spokesman for Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon, and
SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Raytheon said it named William Swanson as president.
He had been head of the company's electronic systems unit.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon shares rose 82 cents to $35 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<TE>   Cost Cutting Helps Merrill Post a Profit</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said Tuesday that its profit rose for the
first time in six quarters after the brokerage giant cut costs more
than its rivals amid a continuing slump in new stock sales and
mergers.</TE>
<TE>   Net income in the second quarter rose 17% to $634 million, or 66
cents a share, from $541 million, or 56 cents, a year earlier. The
latest results included an expense of $111 million Merrill incurred
to settle charges that its analysts misled investors to win and
retain investment banking assignments.</TE>
<TE>   The results beat the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Second-quarter revenue fell 11% to $5 billion, Merrill said. But
expenses dropped 15% to $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company eliminated about 15,000 jobs last year, and may cut
more positions, Chief Financial Officer Thomas Patrick said.</TE>
<TE>   He warned that sales in the year's second half probably would not
be as strong as in the first half because of "seasonal factors."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's stock gained 40 cents to $37.35 on the New York Stock
Exchange. It's down 28% this year.</TE>

<TE>   Schwab Results Are Flat in 'Difficult' Market</TE>
<TE>   Discount brokerage Charles Schwab Corp. on Tuesday posted another
quarter of lackluster earnings amid sharp declines in customer stock
trading, and the firm said it was under pressure in a market
environment moving from "difficult towards brutal."</TE>
<TE>   Schwab, which has 8 million customers, earned $98 million, or 7
cents a share, in the second quarter. That compared with $102
million, or 7 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue dipped to $1.05 billion from $1.07 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Though the results met analysts' expectations, Schwab shares fell
31 cents to $10.47 on the New York Stock Exchange amid downbeat
comments from the firm's chief financial officer, Christopher Dodds.</TE>
<TE>   "We would characterize the quarter as a credible financial
performance, but not spectacular, in an environment that is trending
away from difficult towards brutal," Dodds said. "In terms of an
environment that translates into revenues and profits, we certainly
continue to face a lot of pressure."</TE>
<TE>   To help lower costs, the company has cut 2.5% of its staff since
the beginning of the year, and Dodds said Schwab will continue to
reduce its work force.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Warfield made everyone feel better. With a joke, a well-placed
ice pack or a cold glass of water, Warfield was always there to ease
the pain.</LD>
<LD>   But Warfield is gone. And the Cleveland Indians are hurting.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hard to believe," shortstop Omar Vizquel said. "He was
always there for you, to comfort you. To not have him around is very
strange."</LD>
<TE>   Warfield, the Indians' trainer of more than 30 years, died of a
brain hemorrhage Tuesday only a few hours before Cleveland lost to
the Chicago White Sox, 5-4, at Jacobs Field.</TE>
<TE>   Magglio Ordonez hit his second homer of the game, a leadoff shot
in the ninth inning against Bob Wickman (0-3), and the White Sox won
for only the second time in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Warfield, who joined the Indian organization in 1969, suffered a
massive brain hemorrhage Monday at the ballpark. He was 60.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians considered not playing, but went on just as Warfield
would have wanted them to.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the toughest game I ever pitched," Indian starter C.C.
Sabathia said. "It was hard to come to the park today. He was a big
part of everybody's life. He was always the first guy you saw when
you came in.</TE>
<TE>   "Not seeing him in the dugout was tough."</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland players wrote "JW" on their caps in tribute to Warfield.
As he took his position in the field in the first, Jim Thome dropped
to a knee in prayer before using his fingers to write Warfield's
initials in the infield dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 9, Detroit 4--Manny Ramirez had a career-high five hits,
including a go-ahead double in a five-run eighth inning at Detroit
that was capped by Trot Nixon's grand slam.</TE>
<TE>   John Burkett (9-3) gave up four runs and six hits in six innings,
and has won consecutive decisions for the first time since May 29 and
June 4.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 6, Seattle 1--Scott Erickson (4-9) pitched a six-hitter
and struck out seven at Baltimore for his first victory in 13 starts
since April 28.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Cordova homered and drove in three runs as the Orioles
completed a two-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Matthews Jr. also homered for the Orioles. Mike Cameron had
three hits, including a homer, and stole two bases for the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 2, Tampa Bay 1--Mark Mulder won for the ninth time in 10
starts and Jermaine Dye homered at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder (11-5) gave up one run and six hits in 7 1/3 innings. He
has given up only 16 earned runs in his last 72 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Dye went three for four and came within a triple of hitting for
the cycle. Randy Winn had four of Tampa Bay's eight hits.</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Toronto 6--Nick Johnson hit a tiebreaking homer in the
ninth inning at Toronto, his 12th.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi's three-run homer capped a five-run seventh inning
for the Yankees, who rallied from a 4-1 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Weaver gave up four runs and nine hits in six innings, struck
out nine and walked two. Mariano Rivera earned his 23rd save.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 6, Texas 5--Brent Mayne led off the bottom of the 11th
inning with his first home run in more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals won a season-high fifth in a row. Texas was swept in
the three-game series and has lost four in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Palmeiro hit his 470th homer and Herbert Perry also
connected as the Rangers set a team record by homering in their 19th
consecutive game.</TE>

<HD>Angels Live on the Edge</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Washburn's win streak reaches 11 in tense 4-2
victory over Twins. Next is stretch against A's, Mariners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Adam Kennedy stayed down, face down, for a moment. He had to exhale.
He had just dived headfirst and slammed his glove against second
base, securing a victory precarious down to the final out.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels flew to Oakland on Tuesday night more relieved than
thrilled. They tiptoed across the high wire for nine innings without
tumbling off. They survived, from a bases-loaded jam in the first
inning to the potential winning run coming to bat in the ninth. They
endured yet another injury, their starting pitcher pushed himself to
his limit and perhaps beyond, and their patchwork bullpen hung tough.</LD>
<LD>   And so it is on a winning note that the Angels open an 11-game
stretch against their American League West rivals tonight. Jarrod
Washburn extended his winning streak to 11 games and stopped the
Angels' losing streak at three, with Scot Shields and Ben Weber
providing three innings of hitless relief and Garret Anderson hitting
a home run in a 4-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<TE>   All things considered, the standings are not bad: The Angels trail
the Seattle Mariners by three games, and they are tied with the
Athletics. Now comes a series against Oakland, a series against
Seattle, then another against Oakland and another against Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not doomed if we don't have a good stretch, but it
certainly would hurt our chances," said pitcher Kevin Appier, who
starts tonight in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Said Washburn: "We're going to see what we're made of. We have to
play better baseball than we've been playing the last few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are 7-5 in July and 15-13 since June 15.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Percival is on the disabled list, and fellow relievers Dennis
Cook and Al Levine preceded him there. Catcher Bengie Molina played
for the first time in four days, but his strained hamstring still
bothers him and he might not play tonight. Outfielder Darin Erstad
also might not play; he walked gingerly around the clubhouse after
doctors drained an infected blood blister on his left foot.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the preferred way to arrive at such a critical
juncture in the schedule. They will nonetheless play on, in so doing
grateful they have Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   For the ninth time this season, Washburn pitched after an Angel
loss. For the seventh time, they won.</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Scott Spiezio recalled playing for the A's in 1998,
when Kenny Rogers went 11-0 at the Oakland Coliseum. That "we're
gonna win" feeling the A's had when Rogers pitched at home, Spiezio
suggested, is the same feeling the Angels have when Washburn pitches
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn (11-2) last lost April 13. He set a club record for most
consecutive victories during a single season; Chuck Finley won 14 in
a row in 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   This one was not easy, but with the bullpen staggering beneath the
weight of all those injuries, Washburn talked Manager Mike Scioscia
out of removing him after five innings and 111 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't usually win that argument," Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   He was good for one more inning, as he promised. He made 126
pitches, more than in any game this season or last. He tossed a 4-2
lead to the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Shields pitched two perfect innings. Weber, whose only other major
league save came when he worked the last three innings of a 5-1
victory, worked the ninth for what he called "my first real save,"
one day after reliever Scott Schoeneweis gave up two home runs in two
innings and lost the game.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel the added pressure," Weber said. "It's good to come out
the next day and get the job done."</TE>
<TE>   He threw 20 pitches, 11 of them balls. He walked two. He fielded a
comebacker and almost threw the ball over the head of Spiezio. And
then he got Cristian Guzman to hit a ground ball up the middle, and
Kennedy ranged beyond second base, shifted direction, threw his body
at the base and tagged it for the force.</TE>
<TE>   Game over, and whew.</TE>

<HD>Black on Indians' List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Cleveland Indians are believed to have included Angel pitching
coach Bud Black on a list of prospective managers for next season,
and Black said he is interested in the possibility of managing a team
with which he has close ties.</LD>
<LD>   The Indians fired Charlie Manuel last week and appointed coach
Joel Skinner as interim manager. In addition to Skinner and Black,
the list of candidates is believed to include Buddy Bell, Terry
Francona and Eddie Murray, all of whom have ties to the team.</LD>
<LD>   "It's something I'd think about," Black said. "I know the people
in Cleveland extremely well. Right now, I'm consumed with what we're
trying to do with the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   "But any time your name is talked about in a leadership position,
it's intriguing."</TE>
<TE>   Black, 45, pitched in Cleveland for four seasons. After his
retirement in 1995, the Indians employed him in several capacities,
including advance scouting, player evaluation and minor league coach.
In 1999, when the Angels were searching for a pitching coach,
then-Cleveland general manager John Hart and assistant Mark Shapiro
recommended Black. Shapiro, who replaced Hart last year, remains
close to Black.</TE>
<TE>   Black has no managerial experience, but Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia has no reservations about endorsing him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a tremendous people person. He has a great knowledge of
baseball--not only pitching, but all areas," Scioscia said. "I think
he'd be a great candidate, and I know he'd be a very, very good
manager."</TE>
<TE>   Black has drawn raves for his work with the Angels' young
pitchers, and Shapiro has said the Indians are adding young players
and rebuilding. Black's contract with the Angels expires after this
season, and it is possible Shapiro could pursue Black as the Indians'
pitching coach if he does not hire Black as manager.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Darin Erstad did not play Tuesday and might not play
tonight after a blood blister atop his left foot became infected.
Doctors prescribed antibiotics after Erstad noticed some redness on
the foot Monday night. When he awoke Tuesday, he said his foot
"looked like my hat," pointing to his bright-red Angel cap, and he
was sent to a local hospital to have the blister drained and
additional antibiotics injected.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 University of Florida team that finished third in the
College World Series featured three players currently serving as
leadoff hitters for major league teams--shortstop David Eckstein of
the Angels, second baseman Mark Ellis of the Oakland A's and
outfielder Brad Wilkerson of the Montreal Expos.</TE>
<TE>   In college, they batted in that order. When the Angels play the
A's tonight, a '96 Gator will lead off for both teams, for the first
time in the major leagues.</TE>

<HD>Dolan Puts Blame on Steinbrenner</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cleveland Indian owner Larry Dolan blamed New York Yankee owner
George Steinbrenner for some of baseball's economic problems, and
said a strike might be necessary.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking on Tuesday at a luncheon in the Cleveland suburb of
Mayfield Heights, Dolan criticized Steinbrenner for increasing his
team's payroll even more through trades for Raul Mondesi and Jeff
Weaver in preparation for another postseason run.</LD>
<LD>   Dolan took offense at Steinbrenner's criticism of Minnesota Twin
owner Carl Pohlad for not spending enough money.</LD>
<TE>   "What he doesn't say is George is not spending George's money.
George is spending revenue that most of us don't have," Dolan said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Yankees, whose payroll is about $135 million, are
forcing other teams to overspend so they can compete. He used the
World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks as an example, saying they
"bought themselves a World Series last year."</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball cannot continue with its current economics. It just
can't," he said. "It's not in any of our interests to have baseball
be such that each season it's going to be the Yankees against some
other team in the World Series. That can't continue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas Ranger closer Hideki Irabu will remain hospitalized in
Kansas City for two or three more days after being diagnosed with a
series of small blood clots in the lungs. Irabu was hospitalized
after complaining of chest pains and shortness of breath Monday.</TE>

<TE>   A judge lashed out at several Detroit Tigers accused of sexually
harassing a flight attendant on the team airplane two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kesner filed a federal lawsuit in May 2001 against the
Tigers, three holding companies and Olympia Aviation, which handled
charter flights for the Tigers and the Detroit Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   Kesner alleges that several Tigers subjected her to lewd comments
and inappropriate physical touching, and displayed pornography on a
laptop computer within plain view.</TE>
<TE>   None of the players are named as defendants. A Tiger spokesman
said the team had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff dismissed all but one of
the counts. He set a trial date of Aug. 1 on one count of sexual
harassment against Olympia Aviation. The company, now dissolved, was
owned by Tiger owner Mike Ilitch.</TE>
<TE>   "In particular, the court notes that the behavior of the baseball
players is particularly shameful and disgraceful," Zatkoff wrote.</TE>

<LD>Bob Sansevere of the St. Paul Pioneer Press, addressing Tiger Woods'
competition in the British Open:</LD>
<LD>   "You guys have your work cut out, trying to derail Tiger's
historic attempt to complete a Grand Slam.</LD>
<LD>   "What must it be like for you fellows, knowing that Tiger is a
better player? And knowing that Tiger practices harder and longer?
And that Tiger is mentally tougher?</LD>
<TE>   "Chances are, it means you've familiarized yourselves with the
size of the check for finishing second."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who are the two players who lacked only the British
Open to win the career Grand Slam?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Special treatment: Don't expect Philadelphia authorities to come
down hard on Allen Iverson, writes Bob Lipper of the Richmond (Va.)
Times-Dispatch:</TE>
<TE>   "This is what gives Iverson leverage: He is box office. Mega box
office. Box office in neon. The [76ers] averaged fewer than 12,000
per game in 1995-96--the season before Iverson came bounding off
Georgetown's campus as a sophomore. The turnstile count was up to
20,560 per outing this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Iverson's No. 3 jersey is the biggest seller in basketball. He's
got the city at his feet.... Jaw-dropping talent has a way of
whitewashing a soiled resume."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Home of the brave: The Denver Nuggets held an open tryout Sunday,
and 262 players showed up for a four-hour basketball workout in
95-degree heat.</TE>
<TE>   "This is America, the land of opportunity," General Manager Kiki
Vandeweghe said. "I wanted to provide everyone the equal opportunity
to become a part of the Nuggets."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rhythm and blues: The International Gymnastics Federation has
expelled four judges from the rhythmic world championships for
improprieties and serious judging mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "We said enough is enough," spokesman Andre Gueisbuhler said.</TE>
<TE>   And you thought baseball had problems.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bygone era: Joe Brovia, who died in 1994, was one of the most
feared hitters in Pacific Coast League baseball history. He offered
this observation to author Brent Kelley for a newly published book,
"The San Francisco Seals, 1946-57":</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that irritates me is these guys charging all this money
for autographs. I get 12, 15 letters a month. I send pictures to some
people; I buy them myself. I don't charge. I love hearing from the
fans. Baseball was my life. I owe baseball a lot. I'm lucky to have
played the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Byron Nelson and Raymond Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: John McClain of the Houston Chronicle writes that
it's fitting former Houston Oiler offensive lineman Bruce Matthews
announced his retirement only a few days before the expansion Houston
Texans report for their first training camp:</TE>
<TE>   "One chapter of Houston's football history closes, but another
begins. The Texans will draft thousands of players over the years,
but they'll have a hard time finding one who has more talent and
class and is as durable and competitive as Matthews."</TE>
<TE>   The former USC standout played 19 NFL seasons and was a 14-time
Pro Bowl selection, matching former Los Angeles Ram defensive lineman
Merlin Olsen for the most in NFL history.</TE>

<HD>Woods Still Seeks Emotional Rescue</HD>
<DH>Golf: He hasn't won the hearts of British Open fans the way
Jones, Palmer, Nicklaus and Watson did.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Bobby Jones felt as much a part of St. Andrews as he did of Augusta
National, the course he helped create and mold into one of the most
famous in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Arnold Palmer crossed Swilken Burn for the last time at the Old
Course in 1995, turned to wave goodbye and there were enough tears
from Scottish fans to raise the tide in the Firth of Forth.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Nicklaus followed Palmer's steps across the Swilken bridge
five years later, ending the intimate relationship he had built with
Open fans since his first of three British Open championships, at
Muirfield in 1966.</LD>
<TE>   When Tom Watson and Nicklaus squared off in the epic head-to-head
struggle to win at Turnberry in 1977, the cheers from fans were so
intense that Watson had to take a 15-minute break before dropping his
2 1/2-foot putt for the second of his five Open titles.</TE>
<TE>   They are four American legends who played their way into the
hearts of fans in the birthplace of the game, golfers who have become
as much a part of links lore as wind, rain and a stiff upper lip.</TE>
<TE>   And now, there's Tiger.</TE>
<TE>   At 26, a winner of eight major championships--including seven of
the last 11--and going after the third leg of the Grand Slam, Tiger
Woods has taken golf to a new level and taken hordes of fans along
for the ride. Fans of the British Open, who know a golf phe-nomenon
when they see one, flock to see what he can do on the course, how he
creates shots to deal with the many situations peculiar to links
play.</TE>
<TE>   But he still might have a way to go before the emotional
connection with fans is as strong as it has been for Jones, Palmer,
Nicklaus and Watson. He has, after all, won only one British Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a lot of fans feel so close to Tiger as they did to
Arnold," said Jim Mcainsh of Edinburgh, who has regularly attended
the tournament since Palmer finished second in his first Open in
1960.</TE>
<TE>   "With Tiger, there's a good deal of awe. He's the best in the
world, and we can certainly appreciate that. But we love the game
here, and with Watson and Nicklaus at Turnberry, that competition was
fantastic. That's what we want to see. We'd prefer that to seeing
everyone else playing for second place."</TE>
<TE>   More than anywhere, fans here accept the unfairness of golf as a
matter of course; they know sideways rain, knee-high rough and
unseen, penal bunkers are simply part of the game. Succeed at it, and
they'll respond to it.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why Ben Hogan, who won the Open at Carnoustie in his only
trip to Britain, was deeply respected by fans here--even though he
had so little use for links courses, he never even visited St.
Andrews. Hogan went so far as to sarcastically suggest he provide
mowers from his course in Texas to trim the Open grass. Still, he was
highly regarded, known as the "Wee Ice Mon," and the town of
Carnoustie is nearly a shrine to a player some consider the best ball
striker ever. That goes a long way in these parts.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy their game, and they recognize I enjoy it," said Watson,
who won five British Opens, including the 1980 event at Muirfield,
site of this week's championship.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no 'You da man!' over here," he said of Open crowds.
"They know when it's proper to really cheer and when not to. That's
one reason why we get along so well."</TE>
<TE>   Jones had a similar relationship with fans here. Named a Freeman
of St. Andrews in 1958, the first American so honored since Benjamin
Franklin, Jones said that if all the experiences of his life other
than those at St. Andrews were eliminated, he would still have led a
full life.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer helped put the British Open back into Americans'
consciousness when he finished second at St. Andrews in 1960. He won
the next two years, and American golfers who had ignored the
tournament because of the demanding travel and relatively small purse
followed him.</TE>
<TE>   Englishman Peter Baker played with Palmer in his last Open at St.
Andrews, an 83 in the second round of the '95 tournament. "It was
incredible," Baker said at the time. "It was something to be
treasured forever."</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus was considered the greatest golfer the world had seen and
grew to love the links game. The feeling was reciprocated.</TE>
<TE>   "The people were so fantastic. I got such great support in
Scotland," Nicklaus said last week.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1972 tournament at Muirfield, Nicklaus was making a
fourth-round charge against eventual winner Lee Trevino and birdied
No. 11 to take the lead. "I'm a pretty emotional guy," he said, "but
I'm on the 11th green and people are going bonkers. Tears were
running down my face."</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus played in 37 British Opens, finishing no lower than sixth
from 1966 through 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans over there have always liked champions," he said.
They've always liked winners. They've embraced them. They did it with
me, they did it with Arnold, they did it with Gary [Player], they did
it with Watson.</TE>
<TE>   "Over here, you go to every city and there are all these sports
teams.... They don't have as many sports. I think it's noteworthy
that golf is probably a whole lot bigger sport in Great Britain than
this country."</TE>
<TE>   Now Woods is in Scotland to continue his assault on history, to
put another trophy on his mantel in his stated aim to surpass
Nicklaus' total of 18 majors, and crowds totaling about 160,000 for
the week will turn out to witness his attempt.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always said this: The fans over here that come to the Open
Championship are the most knowledgeable fans," Woods said. "This is
where the game of golf started. They recognize that not every shot
that gets airborne is a good shot. If you hit a shot up there to 30,
40 feet, and they know it's a good shot, you'll hear a difference in
the ovations. That's what all of us who come out here and play in the
Open truly admire and respect about the fans."</TE>
<TE>   And the fans have shown their support for Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "My relationship [with the fans] has been absolutely great," he
said. "I mean, they have been extremely nice to me and gracious."</TE>
<TE>   And will they show the kind of heart-pounding affection they've
shown for the likes of Palmer and Nicklaus?</TE>
<TE>   Said Watson: "Time will tell."</TE>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>We know Tiger Woods isn't allergic to winning, but that's one of the
few things that isn't on his list, he says.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I'm allergic to my job," said Woods, who mentioned
Tuesday that his allergies are bothering him at Muirfield. "I'm
allergic to grass, trees, dust, pollen, it's something I've always
had. When I was a kid, it was 10 times worse than it is now."</LD>
<LD>   Woods missed the Western Open with flu-like symptoms, but has been
in Ireland and now Scotland for a week, fishing and playing golf in
Ireland. Woods said he played Port Marnock, the European Club and
Mount Juliet.</LD>
<TE>   He has played practice rounds at Muirfield since Sunday and says
he is looking forward to trying to win the third leg of the Grand
Slam when the British Open begins Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The golf course is playing very difficult now," he said. "It's
probably the softest I've seen [at] an Open Championship with the
fairways this lush, but the rough is obviously up and that's going to
be a challenge this week to keep [the ball] in play."</TE>
<TE>   Woods also said that Muirfield is not as demanding as Augusta
National or Bethpage Black, at least off the tee, and his advantage
in length is not as great because many players can hit irons off the
tee.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Norman agreed that Muirfield is much different than Bethpage
Black, the longest course in U.S. Open history.</TE>
<TE>   "Length is not a premium here even when the wind blows, it's
accuracy," Norman said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Love III said in his practice rounds he has hit a driver at
only three holes, but not at the 448-yard, par-four No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Courses like this better decide who's the best player," Love
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Woods was stopped by a marshal Monday after he forgot his
identification, but talked his way in.</TE>
<TE>   Said Woods: "She may not have been a huge golf fan ... I just said
I won this tournament two years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Woods said the marshal was only doing her job.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe people forget. I don't know, two years is a long time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Muirfield has no women members and no junior program, but Woods
wasn't taking sides in the issue. Neither did he take a position or
have much to say about last week's controversy involving Augusta
National and the National Council of Women's Organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to see every golf course open to everyone who
wanted to participate, but that's just now where society is," he
said. "If you just buttonholed this single issue, I think you are not
doing justice in the bigger scope and I think there are a lot of
other things that go into it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just simple ... he's too young or he's not the right
race or he doesn't believe in the right religion ... there's a lot
more to it than just that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It has been a baffling year for David Duval, who won last year at
Lytham, but still hasn't gotten on track this year. Duval says he
lost focus and then became too absorbed in his swing. "I wish there
was a secret or something, something that's happened, but that's not
the case," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Remember Lee Westwood? A year ago at the British Open at Lytham,
Westwood was eighth in the Official World Ranking and he was No. 4
only 14 months ago. Westwood hasn't won in two years and has fallen
to 102nd in the rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Westwood, who tied for 64th at St. Andrews in 2000 and then tied
for 47th last year at Lytham, is paired with Ernie Els and Brad Faxon
the first two rounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If there is slow play at Muirfield, it's not going to be Bill
Yates' fault. Yates, of Rolling Hills Estates, has been hired by the
Royal and Ancient as a consultant to help maintain a consistent pace
of play. Yates, president of Pace Manager Systems, inspired the
USGA's Pace Rating Manual.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No, it is not intimidating to play against Woods, says Sergio
Garcia, despite what happened at the U.S. Open, where Woods began
slowly and Garcia failed to mount a charge.</TE>
<TE>   "You [reporters] like to try to intimidate us about playing with
him," Garcia said. "He makes you feel good. I love playing with him.
I know he's a great player and, yes, I do get nervous when I play
with him because I know I have to play my best, but [I am] not at all
intimidated because I know if I play well, I can beat anybody out
here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Interesting pairings for the first two rounds include Woods,
Justin Rose and Shigeki Maruyama; Duval, Thomas Bjorn and Shingo
Katayama; Norman, Garcia and Robert Karlsson; Vijay Singh, Jesper
Parnevik and Jim Furyk; Love, Colin Montgomerie and K.J. Choi and
Phil Mickelson, Nick Faldo and Hal Sutton.</TE>
<TE>   John Daly, who might be the fastest player on the tour, is paired
with Padraig Harrington, one of the slowest.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Lack Basic Rights</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They are knocked out of first place after blown
play on a sacrifice bunt for second straight game leads to 9-2 loss
to the Cardinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sacrifice bunt is one of the most fundamental plays in baseball.</LD>
<LD>   Teams that execute the unselfish play are positioned to score
runs. Those that successfully defend against it routinely erase
threats.</LD>
<LD>   The struggling Dodgers did neither in key situations during a
two-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals and they sacrificed
first place in the National League West in the process.</LD>
<TE>   A 9-2 loss Tuesday before 37,988 at Dodger Stadium dropped the
Dodgers a half-game behind the Arizona Diamondbacks, who defeated the
San Francisco Giants.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers managed only five hits against five Cardinal pitchers
and committed two errors while losing for the eighth time in 11
games. They are 1-5 since the All-Star break and open a two-game
series tonight against the last-place San Diego Padres before meeting
the fast-closing, third-place Giants in a three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to have a stumbling block, which every club goes
through during the course of a season, better it be now for us than
in the latter part of September when this would be a very critical
issue," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "I don't see it as being one
right now."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, however, clearly are not executing with the
efficiency that propelled them to the top of the NL West standings
and produced one of the best records in the majors in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Their most glaring miscue for the second game in a row centered on
a bunt play.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, the Dodgers missed a potential chance to tie the
score in the ninth inning after the first two batters reached base.
Leadoff man Dave Roberts popped up a sacrifice-bunt attempt to third,
and the Cardinals then got Paul Lo Duca to hit into a game-ending
double play for a 4-2 victory.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, with the score tied, 2-2, and two runners on in the
seventh inning, Dodger pitcher Hideo Nomo made a throwing error to
third base on a sacrifice bunt by Mike Matheny. The Cardinals turned
it into a two-run play and three-run inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, some of the little things that we've taken a lot of
pride in, that we have made very, very important--we're not doing
them so well," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Like Tracy, Dodger players unanimously maintain that they are
neither worried nor pressing. But the players acknowledge that they
have gotten away from the formula that made them so successful in the
first half.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not good enough to go out there and just wait for the
three-run home run," Roberts said. "We have to play the game
fundamentally right, the way it's supposed to be played with good
pitching, defense, situational hitting and things like that.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look back at the games to start the second half, we have
come up short and the results are apparent."</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Edgar Renteria was four for four with a double, scored
three runs and drove in three runs for the Cardinals. The NL Central
leaders had 11 hits and extended their winning streak to four with
their ninth victory in their last 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Benes, making his fourth start of the season after missing 76
games because of an arthritic right knee, gave up a solo homer to
Adrian Beltre in the second inning and a run-scoring double to Beltre
in the fourth, but he allowed only one other hit and struck out six
in four innings. Mike Matthews, Luther Hackman (2-3), Steve Kline and
Mike Crudale limited the Dodgers to two hits the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes without saying that we are in a little bit of an
offensive rut collectively," said Tracy, whose team stranded nine
runners Monday and seven Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo (9-6), who was 7-0 with a 2.60 earned-run average in his
previous 11 starts, put the Dodgers in a hole Tuesday despite
pitching well.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up seven hits, struck out eight and did not walk a batter
in 6 2/3 innings, but his seventh-inning error was the difference.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo gave up singles to Renteria and Eli Marrero before Matheny
bunted toward the mound. Nomo charged, fielded the ball and threw to
third base, but the ball sailed wide to Beltre's left. Renteria
cruised home with the go-ahead run and Marrero never broke stride to
put the Cardinals ahead, 4-2. Two outs later, Matheny scored on
Placido Polanco's double.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo said he did not hurry the throw and the ball did not slip out
of his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "It was as you saw it," Nomo said.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he is looking for his team to right itself by returning
to the basics.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to see us get back to playing the game correctly," he
said. "Once we get back to that, which I know we will, everything
will fall into place."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Beltre Is Starting to Produce</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite being swept in a two-game series by the St. Louis Cardinals,
the Dodgers were encouraged by the performance of third baseman
Adrian Beltre.</LD>
<LD>   Beltre batted sixth and went three for eight with two home runs, a
double and four runs batted in. He is batting .238 with 10 homers and
36 RBIs.</LD>
<LD>   "He's one guy the last two days that you can point a finger at and
say that guy has really produced," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   If Beltre continues to emerge from his struggles of the last two
months--he batted .207 in May and .205 in June--the Dodgers might shy
away from including him in trade proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek also had a strong series. He
batted seventh and went five for eight to raise his average to .251.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been some production from that area [of the lineup] that
we haven't seen a lot of throughout much of the season," Tracy said.
"But over the course of the last couple of days it has picked up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy held a short clubhouse meeting after Tuesday's 9-2 loss,
something he has done only a few times this season.</TE>
<TE>   "He just wanted everybody together to make sure everybody is on
the same page," center fielder Dave Roberts said. "It's not a huge,
fire-up meeting or panic meeting. It was nothing like that.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just putting this situation in perspective. We have a long
way to go. As long as we play good baseball, things will work out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy held catcher Paul Lo Duca out of the lineup because the
Dodgers were playing only 14 hours after completing Monday night's
game. Chad Kreuter, playing for the first time since coming off the
disabled list Friday, made his first start since June 23. He was
hitless in three at-bats.... Cardinal center fielder Jim Edmonds
ranks among the National League leaders in batting average, slugging
percentage and on-base percentage, but he continues to struggle
against Dodger right-hander Hideo Nomo. Nomo struck Edmonds out three
times Tuesday. Edmonds is one for 11 with nine strikeouts against
Nomo. Edmonds also struck out against Jesse Orosco.... Dodger
reliever Guillermo Mota gave up four runs in the eighth inning,
increasing his earned-run average from 2.43 to 3.44.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Leaves Expos' Future Even Cloudier</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Former minority owners of team accuse Selig,
Loria and DuPuy of fraud, seek $100 million in damages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A civil lawsuit against Commissioner Bud Selig and the former owner
of the Montreal Expos further clouds the future of the franchise and
delays Major League Baseball's plan to eliminate or auction the only
club it operates.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys representing the 14 former minority partners of the
Expos, who want the club to be placed in a trust, filed the lawsuit
Tuesday in Federal District Court in Miami against Selig, Jeffrey
Loria, owner of the Florida Marlins and former managing partner of
the Expos, and Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer,
accusing them of mail fraud and wire fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The group's suit contends that Selig, Loria and other high-ranking
baseball officials conspired to eliminate baseball in Montreal and
reduce their holdings--from 76% to about 7%--in the club.</LD>
<TE>   The suit alleges Loria, a prominent New York art dealer, lied to
the partners when he bought 24% of the Expos in 1999. He increased
his stake to 94% through a series of cash calls, reducing the
percentages of his partners when they could not come up with the
money.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contends that that violated the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO), and calls for $100 million
in punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages. And the
group's announced intention to seek an injunction if baseball tries
to move or fold the team could present the biggest immediate headache
for Selig with contraction, he maintains, still the next step for the
Expos.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk about the Montreal Expos, everything up to this
point has bogged down the prospects of contraction and relocation,"
said David Carter of the Sports Business Group, an L.A.-based
consulting firm. "Now, when you fold in this RICO lawsuit, what it
really does is slow down the process to a crawl."</TE>
<TE>   Loria called the claims "completely without merit," adding that
"it is ironic that these partners are now claiming to be so committed
to baseball in Montreal when they were unwilling to fund a penny of
operating losses since 1991, and instead directed 'fire sales' of
players during the 1990s."</TE>
<TE>   DuPuy, commenting on behalf of baseball, dismissed the suit as
being "frivolous" and "wholly without merit", saying the
commissioner's office had nothing to do with the losses and
criticizing the partners' action as a "shameless attempt to obtain
through publicity what they know they are not entitled to legally."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of motives, the suit stirs more questions about the
future of the Expos, who many believe are in their last season in
Montreal but will remain in existence after bidding between competing
groups seeking a franchise for Northern Virginia and Washington. The
Expos' recent acquisitions of pitcher Bartolo Colon and outfielder
Cliff Floyd lends credibility to the theory that the club, under the
direction of the commissioner's office, is trying to make its roster
more attractive to increase the price in a possible relocation
auction.</TE>
<TE>   Selig postponed contraction after owners were pummeled in the
Minnesota courts, which ruled the Twins had to honor their 2002 lease
in the Metrodome, and baseball settled a Minnesota lawsuit by
agreeing not to eliminate the Twins for the 2003 season. The Expos
currently do not have a contraction partner, increasing the
likelihood of Major League Baseball returning to the Washington area
after a 31-year absence.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitrator ruling on the contraction grievance filed by the
Major League Baseball Players Assn., trying to prevent Selig from
unilaterally eliminating teams, is expected Aug. 1, and the suit
could be another issue on the table when owners and the union meet
again this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, [the suit] complicates things, sort of across the
board," said Don Fehr, executive director of the union. "We're
hearing that they still want to contract [the Expos], and all of this
has to sort itself out before anything can happen.</TE>
<TE>   "We have suggested, as part of our bargaining proposals, that
before they contract, they ought to consider any offers to buy and
relocate. So far, they've rejected that, so we can only proceed based
on what they're saying."</TE>
<TE>   Some believe signs indicate the Expos are moving instead of
folding, pointing to the acquisitions of Colon and Floyd for support.
Although Floyd can become a free agent after the season, the addition
of both players to the surprising club's roster could help it remain
in contention for the National League wild-card berth.</TE>
<TE>   "Strictly looking at it from a baseball standpoint, you've got to
like their club," Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane said.
"They've got power, speed and starting pitching. What's been great is
that there has been energy injected into what seemed like a hopeless
situation going into the season, but the other side of it is that
you're also dealing with sort of an artificial situation too."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when the Galaxy players were getting ready for a much-needed
three-game home stand, the soccer powers that be have sent them back
on the road, halfway across the country, for a nonleague match.</LD>
<LD>   The Galaxy has played nine of its last 12 Major League Soccer
games on the road. It begins defense of its U.S. Open Cup title
tonight in Blaine, Minn., in a third-round game against the Minnesota
Thunder of the A-League.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Sigi Schmid said the Galaxy was looking at the game in a
positive light rather than as a hindrance.</LD>
<TE>   "We're defending a title so that's a responsibility the team takes
seriously," Schmid said Tuesday from Minnesota. "It's our first
domestic title, so that means a lot to us. And thirdly, there is
bonus money involved, so nobody's going to shy away from that."</TE>
<TE>   All A-League teams were issued first-round byes in the U.S. Open
Cup while MLS clubs received byes into the third round.</TE>
<TE>   The Thunder advanced with a 6-1 second-round win over the San
Diego Gauchos of the D3 Pro League on June 26. Minnesota is led by
Jakob Fenger (five goals, four assists), Johnny Menyongar (four
goals, five assists) and Johnny Torres (five goals, one assist).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy defender Danny Califf is not eligible to play tonight after
accumulating too many caution points in last year's tournament....
The winner of the Galaxy-Thunder match will play at the winner of the
Seattle Sounders-San Jose Earthquakes game on Aug. 7 in the
quarterfinals.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>With the score tied in the eighth inning and a left-hander on the
mound, Mark Grace was expecting a call back from the dugout. It never
came.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Grace hit a tiebreaking two-run double to lead Randy
Johnson and the Arizona Diamondbacks over the San Francisco Giants,
5-3, Tuesday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Quinton McCracken reached on a fielder's choice in the eighth and
Felix Rodriguez (3-5) walked Tony Womack. An out later, Grace figured
Manager Bob Brenly would pinch-hit Greg Colbrunn against left-hander
Aaron Fultz.</LD>
<TE>   "Once I didn't hear any whistles or anything calling me back I
thought, well, let's go do it," Grace said. "And I got that hit that
went right down the [right-field] line."</TE>
<TE>   Brenly admitted he thought about calling back his first baseman,
but only briefly.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds hit a solo homer and a run-scoring double for the
Giants, who dropped two games behind the first-place Diamondbacks in
the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (13-3) gave up three runs and five hits in seven innings.
He struck out seven to move within eight of teammate Curt Schilling,
who leads the major leagues with 191.</TE>
<TE>   Former teammate Reggie Sanders hit a game-tying homer against
Johnson in the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, you don't want to give up home runs," Johnson said.
"But at least they didn't manufacture runs. It would have been worse
if they had started stringing runs together. I don't feel so bad
about the home runs."</TE>

<HD>Kile's Death Could Lead to Heart Scans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would happen occasionally on trips, when he was alone in a hotel
bed, still wired from the night's game and distracted with thoughts
of his family thousands of miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Spiezio's heart would race a bit, and he would wonder ever
so briefly, "What's that twitch?"</LD>
<LD>   Before, the Angel first baseman would quickly dismiss any worry.
He is a healthy, strong, professional athlete.</LD>
<TE>   Then came June 22, when St. Louis Cardinal pitcher Darryl Kile, 33
years old and in the prime of his career, was found dead in a Chicago
hotel room. A final autopsy report released Tuesday revealed Kile's
coronary arteries were 90% blocked, and that coronary atherosclerosis
(hardening of the arteries) caused his death.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio has suddenly reassessed those little twitches in his
chest.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've learned," he said, "is that it might be something I'd
never expect."</TE>
<TE>   The annual physical examinations major league players typically
have during spring training do not routinely include the types of
tests that might have indicated Kile was in danger.</TE>
<TE>   Some players are hopeful that will change and say teams should
make heart scans routine.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think a lot of guys would be receptive to that," Dodger
catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "When you're at this level, it's easy to
think you're invincible.</TE>
<TE>   "If a guy is shown to have high blood pressure or cholesterol or
to have a family history, why wouldn't you want to take [the scan] to
follow up on it? ... It'd be a relief."</TE>
<TE>   Language in Major League Baseball's collective bargaining
agreement allows for heart scans to be used during physicals, but
there is no immediate plan to make such tests mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so soon [after Kile's death] that the idea of instituting a
policy just can't be answered right now," said Vince Wladika, Major
League Baseball's public relations business director. "There is a
tendency when something like this happens to have a knee-jerk
overreaction. We don't want to not react to this, but the way things
like this usually get addressed are after we sit down and have a
discussion about it with the union."</TE>
<TE>   The current collective bargaining agreement includes a passage
that reads: "The player, when requested by the club, must submit to a
complete physical examination at the expense of the club and, if
necessary, to treatment by a regular physician or dentist in good
standing."</TE>
<TE>   What is considered "complete" is open to interpretation, but no
existing rule forbids treatment such as a heart scan.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Cardinal trainer Barry Weinberg cited doctor-patient
confidentiality when asked about what Cardinal doctors knew of Kile's
heart condition and his family history of heart problems. Kile's
father, David, died at age 44 after a heart attack in 1993. Jay
Alves, a spokesman for the Colorado Rockies, refused to comment on
any medical treatment Kile received during the 1998-99 seasons with
that team.</TE>
<TE>   "Our club obviously wants our players in the best shape possible
and we want to check out whatever is a concern to them or an issue in
their family's history," Alves said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Rob Manfred, Major League Baseball's executive vice president
for labor relations and human resources: "The contents of the team
physical are at the discretion of team doctors; they have the right
to control the players' care. Our view is that if the doctor believes
[a heart scan] is an appropriate part of the physical, they are
obligated to use it. I would not expect any kind of fight on this
from the players. After all, who would want to be responsible for a
guy not taking the test if something happened to him afterward?"</TE>
<TE>   One players' agent who didn't want to be identified said some
players might be reluctant to have a heart scan because it is
"something new and out of the ordinary."</TE>
<TE>   But seven players interviewed during June's Angels-Dodgers series
at Edison Field said they would welcome a heart scan.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's reasonable to say that Darryl Kile is proof that if
more measures were taken, maybe it would have saved his life," Dodger
center fielder Dave Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Angel shortstop David Eckstein: "There might be a fine line
for things we shouldn't agree to, but I don't know where that line's
at, and I don't think it's this. Shoot, this could save your life and
[the owners and MLB] are just making sure we're OK."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Axelrod, Kile's agent, said team-prescribed heart scans
would be beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't know if you need to legislate that," Axelrod said.
"If a player checks 'Yes' to other health conditions in his family
history, do you mandate additional testing for all those, too? That
might be overkill."</TE>
<TE>   There are two widely used heart scans. The Electron Beam Computed
Tomography (EBCT) scan is designed to reveal calcium buildups in
arteries. An EBCT is commonly used in full-body scans that can detect
such problems as brain tumors, lung cancer and kidney stones. The
procedure usually lasts about 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   A Myocardial Perfusion Imaging test, which typically lasts one
hour, requires the injection of a radioactive chemical compound and
allows cardiologists and radiologists to view blood flow around the
heart.</TE>
<TE>   "If you see accumulation or reduced blood flow around the heart,
there is likely some [heart] disease or blockage," said Dr. Heinrich
Shelbert, a cardiologist and radiologist who is a UCLA professor of
molecular and medical pharmacology.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the radiation exposure involved, the American Cancer
Society and American College of Radiology don't recommend scans for
patients without risk factors, such as family history, high
cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity.</TE>
<TE>   In American Heart Assn. guidelines published Tuesday in its
journal, an expert panel reported patients as young as 20 should be
screened to prevent heart disease and strokes if they have two risk
factors.</TE>
<TE>   "The radiation is no more than that in an X-ray, and you know how
many X-rays we've had in our careers?" Angel designated hitter Brad
Fullmer said. "This is a good thing. We're talking about a test that
can rule out if you have signs of the leading cause of death."</TE>
<TE>   Shelbert said the ideal way to incorporate the Myocardial
Perfusion Imaging test is as a follow-up examination for those
identified with risk factors.</TE>
<TE>   That would ease the workload for team doctors who opt to use the
heart scan during the start of spring training, when all players in
major league camp--typically about 65--undergo physicals.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do have one of the risks, my stance is you can't lose by
using this," Shelbert said. "If there's something wrong, the test
will show it."</TE>
<TE>   The EBCT scan costs about $400. The Myocardial Perfusion Imaging
test is about $800. Shelbert said about six million Myocardial
Perfusion Imaging tests will be performed on Americans this year, an
increase of 400,000 from 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The thoroughness of spring training player physicals is inexact.
Although intense scrutiny in spring and postseason physicals is
sometimes required of big-contract players by insurance companies,
examinations vary among teams. Blood pressure and cholesterol level
checks are routine, as are questions about family health history.</TE>
<TE>   Yet two veteran Dodger players said they have never been asked to
submit to an electrocardiogram test, much less a stress test in which
an EKG reading is taken from a player running on a treadmill.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger outfielder Marquis Grissom said a physical during his
rookie year with the Montreal Expos confirmed the heart murmur he had
since childhood. After further tests, Grissom was cleared to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything health-wise, I'm going for, whether I like it or not,"
Grissom said. "When something like [Kile's death] happens, you really
have to look at it. The guy was 33. With the great shape we have to
be in to go out there, when something like that happens, we should do
whatever we can to prevent it or keep it from happening to somebody
else."</TE>
<TE>   Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman said he is in the process of
arranging a discussion of heart scans among some players and team
doctors Lewis Yocum and Craig Milhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a topic of internal discussion here: What place does this
have?" Stoneman said. "Darryl Kile's death was a tragic, sudden and
unexpected event and we've been inundated with calls from companies
who offer the scans. We want to do the right thing and we want our
decision on this to be made intelligently."</TE>
<TE>   The timing for MLB officials to demand heart scans of all players
amid ongoing labor negotiations is prickly and the deep divide on
another health issue, testing for steroids. Baseball owners have
submitted a steroid testing policy, but the union has balked at what
it considers a privacy issue.</TE>
<TE>   Said a source from the owner's side: "Of course it's to our
benefit for our players to be healthy, but how far can we extend
these health issues right now?"</TE>
<TE>   Players can always take the initiative and arrange a heart scan
through their personal physicians. But even that scenario has issues,
said one agent who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of players don't even have personal physicians," the agent
said. "They have [orthopedic surgeons] they go to for things like
knees and ankles, but do most of them have a general internist? No.
They're in such good health, they usually just take the physical in
spring and they're on their way. The only outside doctor they really
have is a dentist."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca and Fullmer confirmed that to be the truth in their cases.</TE>
<TE>   But Spiezio isn't waiting around for a policy to be finalized. He
asked Angel trainer Ned Bergert to arrange a heart scan.</TE>
<TE>   "I've already signed up for one and I'm willing to pay for every
member of my family and my wife's family to take one too," Spiezio
said. "I have two small kids, and when I saw [Kile's] three kids at
his memorial, that crushed me."</TE>

<LD>Although Patrick Valenzuela will win the jockey title at Hollywood
Park, he is not the highest percentage rider in the top five.</LD>
<LD>   Alex Solis, who is second in the standings with 54 victories, 13
less than Valenzuela, holds that honor.</LD>
<LD>   Having recently returned from a short vacation to Mexico with his
family, Solis is winning at a 25% clip, compared to 19% for
Valenzuela. He has earned his 54 victories with only 213 mounts,
compared to Valenzuela's 67 from 359 mounts.</LD>
<TE>   Entering the final five days of the meet before the scene shifts
to Del Mar a week from today, Solis should be busy this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   He is named to ride in seven of the eight races, starting with
2-year-old first-timer Dutchess Eben in the first.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Charles Kenis and 3 Plus U Stable and trained by Caesar
Dominguez, the Cherokee Run filly has trained pretty well after being
purchased for $65,000 earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Solis will ride another maiden, Sharshanna, for Dominguez in the
second, then he will be aboard Lou's Expectation in the fourth, Main
Player (making his turf debut) in the fifth, Fringe Comment (another
first for Dominguez) in the sixth, Irish Warrior in the seventh and
Timely Toss in the eighth. On paper, Solis' best chances for victory
look to be on Lou's Expectation and Irish Warrior.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela has five mounts today. He will be aboard longshot Here
Me Out in the third, contender French Warpaint in the fourth, likely
favorite Rumor Patrol in the fifth, Give Away Joe in the sixth and
Geo Quercus in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Irish Warrior, a tough-luck loser in his latest
for trainer Wally Dollase, will try to make amends in the seventh, a
$58,000 optional claimer at 1 1/16 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Wayne Catalano. The leading trainer at Arlington Park
won with 19 of his first 46 starters.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Rodney Prescott. The jockey lost with 27 of his first
28 mounts at Ellis Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling I'mmuchthebest in the
second, using From A To Z, Royal Moro and Sandra's Pride in the third
and Lou's Expectation, More Influence and French Warpaint in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 5/159. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $29.80/$903.20. Total money bet: $1,034.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>St. Louis Cardinal pitcher Darryl Kile died from a blockage of the
arteries supplying the heart, and there was no evidence that drugs
contributed to his death, Cook County's coroner said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a natural cause of death," Edmund Donoghue, the county's
chief medical examiner, said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Toxicology tests did show evidence of marijuana use, although it
was probably weeks before and was not a factor in Kile's death,
Donoghue said.</LD>
<TE>   Tests were negative on steroids, alcohol, cocaine and ephedrine, a
substance commonly found in dietary supplements banned by some
sports.</TE>
<TE>   Kile, 33, had a 90% blockage in two of three coronary arteries,
Donoghue said, confirming his preliminary analysis shortly after the
death.</TE>
<TE>   He also had an enlarged heart and a blood clot in one of the
coronary arteries.</TE>
<TE>   Donoghue said the artery blockage likely triggered a fatal
irregular heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   A substance believed to be marijuana was found in the hotel room.
Police never tested the material because there was no criminal case
to pursue and it did not contribute to his death.</TE>
<TE>   Kile's heart condition, called coronary atherosclerosis, is
commonly known as hardening of the arteries.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Levin, a cardiologist at Christ Hospital and Medical
Center in suburban Chicago, said all the indicators are that Kile had
advanced heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   "It implies that this was a chronic problem. It didn't just come
up overnight," Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   He said such a condition in someone so young was "unusual but not
unheard of."</TE>

<HD>By George, Let the Serious Bids Begin</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBA executives expect the salary cap to fall for the first time,
several teams already have spent well past the luxury-tax threshold
they believed would be higher, and still a largely untested Devean
George is the talk of a light free-agent market that opens today.</LD>
<LD>   George, 24, has played three seasons with the Lakers, much of them
unremarkable despite tremendous physical gifts, at least in part
because he played behind veterans and in a complicated offensive
system.</LD>
<LD>   Set free when the club declined to exercise the fourth-year option
on his rookie contract, George has met with organizations from New
Jersey to Utah, heard from 12 to 15 teams--if his agent is to be
believed--and read that the Minnesota Timberwolves would offer him
$35 million over six seasons to play in his hometown.</LD>
<TE>   In the past week alone, George has sat down with officials from
the Nets and Timberwolves and had a physical exam in Chicago. On
Monday he met with Net President and General Manager Rod Thorn and
Coach Byron Scott; Thorn seemed suspicious in the aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   "There are several teams that are interested in him--Minnesota,
Utah, Chicago, Washington, Miami," he said. "We had a meeting with
him and we'll see what kind of interest he has in us. The player has
to let you know he's interested in playing for you, and he's not
somebody just trying to use you to drive the price up.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy has met with several teams and will likely meet with
several others."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets have considered moving Richard Jefferson to shooting
guard and therefore might need a small forward. The Wizards are said
to like George enough to offer a starting job, something for which
George has pined.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the Miami Heat and Memphis Grizzlies, once regarded as the
most serious contenders for George, both drafted small forwards. The
Timberwolves already have Wally Szczerbiak. The Bulls think Eddie
Robinson could be their small forward, and also have Jalen Rose.</TE>
<TE>   Where this leaves the Lakers remains to be seen. They would prefer
to re-sign George, though perhaps not at the maximum allowed, and the
tumbling NBA economy could help thin out the big spenders.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers expect to spend their mid-level exception (about $4.7
million), and would allocate at least some of it to initiate a
multi-year contract for George, who at times last season played very
well. According to the collective bargaining agreement, they could go
as far as six years for $35.3 million--the maximum allowed--but
won't, and might rather start with three or four years beginning at
$3.5 million or $4 million, followed by the allowed 10% raises.</TE>
<TE>   The news that the salary cap will drop from $43.5 million to about
$41.5 million, along with the looming luxury tax, could have free
agents jumping at the first reasonable offers starting today, the
first that teams can sign free agents. Still, the only announcements
expected today are from San Antonio, where Malik Rose and Bruce Bowen
have agreed to contracts, and Detroit, where Chauncey Billups has
agreed to a deal.</TE>

<HD>Day Belongs to Millwood and Braves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are some days when everything just feels right. When Kevin
Millwood has one of those days, pity the guys who have to face him.</LD>
<LD>   Millwood was in a groove Tuesday, striking out a season-high 11
and giving up only two hits to win his sixth in a row and lead the
Atlanta Braves over the Chicago Cubs, 2-0, at Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt I was able to locate just about everything today," said
Millwood, whose streak is his longest since he won nine in a row from
Aug. 13, 1999, to May 1, 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "My breaking ball was good, and I thought I had a good slider and
the best curveball all year," Millwood said. "There are not many days
you can go out there and have everything working for you. Today was
one of those days."</TE>
<TE>   He walked only one in seven innings and was never in trouble.
Although some of the Cubs complained about a generous strike zone, it
was Millwood (8-5) and Atlanta's bullpen that caused the real damage.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Remlinger struck out two in one inning of relief, and John
Smoltz struck out the side in the ninth to earn his 33rd save.</TE>
<TE>   "Just give the Atlanta Braves credit. They beat us," Cub interim
Manager Bruce Kimm said. "They've just got good pitchers. Year in and
year out, they have some of the best pitchers in baseball and it's
not because of the umpires. They're just good."</TE>
<TE>   Chipper Jones and Henry Blanco each drove in runs for the Braves,
who ended a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Lieber (6-7) gave up two runs and seven hits in six innings,
but lost to the Braves for the second consecutive start. The Cubs are
5-2 since Kimm took over, with both losses coming to the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   After scoring 27 runs in their first four games after the All-Star
break, the Cubs were overpowered by Millwood. They had a runner in
scoring position only once, when Delino DeShields stole second in the
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   New York 10, Florida 5--Edgardo Alfonzo homered and drove in four
runs, and Mo Vaughn hit a two-run homer at New York to help extend
the Marlins' longest losing streak this season to six games.</TE>
<TE>   Al Leiter (9-7) beat the Marlins for the first time in four tries
this season, giving up four runs and six hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 7, Houston 3--Brian Giles hit a three-run homer to
spark the Pirates at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Oswalt (10-6) gave up six runs and nine hits in seven innings.
The Astros lost their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Fogg (10-6) gave up three runs, seven hits and four walks in
five innings. Brian Boehringer pitched two innings for his first save
since Oct. 4, also at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 6, Montreal 3--Marlon Anderson hit a three-run
double, and Randy Wolf hit a run-scoring single and pitched seven
strong innings at Montreal as the Phillies completed a two-game sweep
of the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's bases-clearing double chased Tony Armas (8-9) to cap
Philadelphia's five-run outburst in the fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf (5-6), who also doubled, gave up seven hits and three runs to
win for only the second time in 10 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 6, Milwaukee 1--Elmer Dessens (6-5) gave up three hits
in six innings and Jason LaRue homered twice at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Ben Sheets (4-11) gave up seven hits in seven
innings, walked none and struck out eight. His only mistake was a
93-mph fastball that LaRue sent over the fence in left field in the
fifth inning for his third homer this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds scored five times in the eighth, three on LaRue's second
homer, against Jason Durocher.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 5, Colorado 1--Rookie Jake Peavy (1-3) gave up one run
in seven innings at San Diego for his first major league victory.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Gant gave Peavy all the offensive support he needed with a
three-run homer in the first inning against rookie Jason Jennings
(9-5) that gave San Diego a 4-0 lead.</TE>

<HD>The Summer Heat Turns Clubhouse Into Madhouse</HD>

<LD>Choking Dogs' update: Dodger pitcher Andy Ashby, noticing a clubhouse
full of media before Tuesday's game, remarked, "Vultures."</LD>
<LD>   I had no idea Ashby and the Dodgers already consider themselves
"dead meat," but as the day unfolded it became obvious the pressure
of mid-July baseball is getting to them.</LD>
<LD>   When I asked Ashby to explain himself, he wimped out and said he
was just talking to himself, I guess a la Richard Nixon talking to
the paintings on the White House wall when they began to close in on
him.</LD>
<TE>   At this rate, come August I worry it will be "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" every time I venture into the Dodger clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AFTER YET another inept Dodger performance Tuesday that dropped
the team out of first place, Manager Jim Tracy closed the clubhouse
for a team meeting. I wonder who was assigned to bring the treat.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Tracy told the media, "I'm not concerned," which
apparently was not the same message he had relayed to his team a few
minutes earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In the clubhouse, meanwhile, Paul Lo Duca lost it, and he didn't
even play Tuesday. He should have reacted like Brian Jordan, who saw
the media horde and, being the team leader they say he is, slipped
out the back door rather than stand accountable. Who says he can't
fill Gary Sheffield's shoes?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE MEDIA were just standing around waiting to talk with pitcher
Hideo Nomo, but since Lo Duca was at his locker and everyone else in
a Dodger uniform seemed to be in hiding, the media began quizzing the
guy who didn't play.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca became weary of the repeated questions. You know how tough
professional players have it, showing up to work at 10:30 for a 12:10
game, not playing and then having to put up with silly questions
before heading home shortly after 4. It's hardly worth the millions
they pay you these days.</TE>
<TE>   Someone asked about a corked bat, and that ticked off Lo Duca, and
I guess it was a stupid question, but how are we going to know if the
Dodgers misplaced their corked bats over the All-Star break if
someone doesn't ask? It wasn't me, by the way.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, that was the corker for Lo Duca, the Dodgers' union player
rep, who wouldn't talk to reporters a day earlier if they asked
anything about the labor unrest in baseball. I would hope the Dodgers
would post a list of questions on their Web site that Lo Duca can be
asked, but in the meantime it's probably going to be hit and miss.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously upset, Lo Duca used a loud voice to get everyone's
attention in the clubhouse, and proclaimed: "We're playing bad now,
OK? That's it.... We'll come back tomorrow.... Geesh."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, now officially unglued, carried his rant through the
media throng as he made his way to the door: "Who cares?" he said. I
was about to tell him that was a stupid question and to never ask it
again, but he wasn't about to be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "We got warning-track power now?" he announced loudly and somewhat
sarcastically, and I guess that was his response to the question
about using or not using corked bats, so maybe that does explain
everything. "Are you ... ?"</TE>
<TE>   Let's just say little Paulie used a bad word, and then in a huff
he was gone.</TE>
<TE>   I decided to spend a little more time at Dodger Stadium because I
didn't want to be on the same freeway as little Paulie, given his
rage, and watched as Nomo accepted his responsibility in defeat and
answered everyone's questions.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green also appeared eventually to patiently field all
queries, and for all I know Chad Kreuter was there, but who cares
what he has to say.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby was also at his locker, but talking only to himself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HERE'S THE situation: The Dodgers were down, 5-2, in the seventh,
a man on first base, a right-hander on the mound for St. Louis and
the pitcher due up for L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy went to his bench and called on Cesar Izturis, a .202
left-handed hitter. In comparison, F.P. Santangelo is Babe Ruth.
Tracy opted to save left-handed hitting Dave Hansen, I guess so he'd
have someone to hit a seven-run homer in the ninth to tie the game.
But I ask, would you rather have a left-handed hitting Izturis, who
can't hit, or a right-handed hitting Lo Duca batting in that
situation?</TE>
<TE>   Izturis was safe on an error, the Cardinals went to the bullpen
for a left-handed pitcher, and Tracy removed left-handed hitting Dave
Roberts, who was something like six for 13 against left-handers, and
replaced him with Marquis Grissom.</TE>
<TE>   Would you rather have Grissom or Lo Duca trying to tie the game?
I'd go with the guy with the corked bat. Grissom grounded into an
inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I READ where Angel outfielder Tim Salmon says, "We all know the
next four weeks are going to make our season," and on the same day
Angel GM Bill Stoneman is saying, "We still have 2 1/2 months left,"
and there's no reason to rush to improve the team just because closer
Troy Percival is unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   I have no doubt Salmon knows what he's talking about.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IF YOU watch the British Open, consider this: Sergio Garcia is 22,
and if he plays golf for another 20 years, you'll probably spend at
least one year of your life watching him waggle and re-grip the club.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Rick Mervis:</TE>
<TE>   "What are your wife and daughters doing on page two of sports? I
would think the Times would want the prestigious Page Two of sports
in California's largest paper to be authored by a person writing
about sports. I know I could do better on napkins."</TE>
<TE>   It's important all of us have a goal in life. Good luck.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Germany's soccer federation Tuesday unveiled an ambitious and costly
plan aimed at producing a constant stream of talented players to help
Bundesliga clubs and, more important, the various national teams
remain competitive internationally.</LD>
<LD>   The program, announced in Frankfurt by Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder,
president of the Deutsche Fusbal Bund, will establish 390 centers of
excellence nationwide where more than 1,200 coaches would provide
extra coaching for as many as 20,000 promising players aged 11 to 17.</LD>
<LD>   The emphasis would be on developing the players' individual
skills, not on teamwork or competition.</LD>
<TE>   The plan will cost $10 million annually, but will keep Germany at
the forefront of the world's game, according to Mayer-Vorfelder.</TE>
<TE>   "This will give the DFB youth program a dimension that does not
exist in any other football association worldwide," he said. "We
can't just sit back after our success in the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Germany finished second behind Brazil at the Korea/Japan '02
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The centers are expected to open by the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arena Names Veteran Roster</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bruce Arena called on veterans from the 1990, 1994 and 1998
World Cup tournaments when he named 18 players to the U.S. team that
will play a Major League Soccer selection in the annual MLS All-Star
game Aug. 3 at RFK Stadium in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Among the old guard who will don U.S. colors one more time are
John Harkes, Alexi Lalas, Mike Burns, Preki, Chris Henderson, Chad
Deering and Juergen Sommer.</TE>
<TE>   The full roster features goalkeepers Sommer and Tony Meola;
defenders Burns, Lalas, Jeff Agoos, Carlos Llamosa and Eddie Pope;
midfielders Deering, Harkes, Henderson, Preki, DaMarcus Beasley, Cobi
Jones, Pablo Mastroeni and Brian Maisonneuve, and forwards Landon
Donovan, Brian McBride and Josh Wolff.</TE>

<TE>   Colombia Needs Foreign Coach</TE>
<TE>   Hernan Dario Gomez, who coached Colombia in the France '98 World
Cup and Ecuador in the 2002 tournament, has declined an offer from
the Colombian soccer federation to return as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said in Bogota that he believes Colombia, which failed to
qualify for Korea/Japan '02, should bring in a foreign coach, and
suggested Brazilian Paulo Cesar Carpegiani as an ideal candidate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scolari Future Undecided</TE>
<TE>   Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who led Brazil to its fifth World Cup
triumph, said in Santiago, Chile, that he has yet to make up his mind
whether to remain Brazil's coach.</TE>
<TE>   Scolari, who is on holiday with his family in Chile, said he will
meet with Brazilian soccer federation leaders July 29 and 30 and
decide then about his future.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senegal's Diouf Signs</TE>
<TE>   Senegal World Cup striker El-Hadji Diouf has signed a five-year
contract with Liverpool, which bought the player from Lens in France
for $15.75 million. Liverpool also has acquired Diouf's Senegal
teammate, Salif Diao, from Sedan in France for $7.88 million, but
Diao will not join the English Premier League team until December.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Japan Makes Plans</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese soccer federation said that it is trying to arrange a
game against Argentina at the National Stadium in Tokyo on Nov. 20
and added that the annual Toyota/Intercontinental Cup, normally
played at that stadium, will be moved to a new venue this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Cup will be played at Yokohama International Stadium, site of
the World Cup final, on Dec. 3 and will feature European champion
Real Madrid against the winner of South America's Copa Libertadores.</TE>

<DH>U.S. Postal Service will spend $25 million to sponsor
Armstrong's team, but critics say the deal does not deliver</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sport measured by a stopwatch, scrutiny of the deal between
Lance Armstrong's team in the Tour de France and the U.S. Postal
Service could be the result of poor timing.</LD>
<LD>   On June 30, the Postal Service instituted a three-cent first-class
stamp increase for only the second time in its 227-year history,
raising the price to 37 cents. Six days later, three-time champion
Armstrong and his eight teammates started pedaling in the Tour,
essentially starting the second year of the Postal Service's
$25-million, four-year sponsorship of the team.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know how this deal will help them climb out from nearly
$13 billion in debt, and they won't tell us what they are getting
back from this," said Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against
Government Waste. "This has nothing to do with their mission of
delivering first-class mail."</LD>
<TE>   The agreement, which extended a relationship between the Postal
Service and the team that began in 1997, was negotiated between Gail
Sonnenberg, the Postal Service's now-retired vice president of sales,
and Mark Gorski, the San Francisco-based chief executive of Tailwind
Sports' 21-rider pro cycling team.</TE>
<TE>   With 900,000 employees, the Postal Service generated nearly $66
billion in revenue with postage, products and services in 2001. The
agency spent $67.6 billion to operate last year, including $146
million on advertising/sponsorship that included the cycling
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Hand, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service, said the
agency's 2002 advertising budget is not expected to dramatically
increase from its 2001 total. Designating $6.25 million annually for
Armstrong's team is a significant change from the 1997 deal that
required only $1 million a year. The contract is a reflection of the
rider's international popularity generated by his comeback from
testicular cancer and string of three consecutive Tour de France
victories.</TE>
<TE>   By striking the four-year deal, the Postal Service has guaranteed
a link to Armstrong should he find himself contending for an
unprecedented sixth consecutive Tour de France championship in 2004.
The Postal Service team's annual budget ranks second among all Tour
teams, behind the Italian Mapei-Quick team's $10 million costs.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong started today's 91.14-mile 10th stage from Bazas to Pau
second in the Tour, 26 seconds behind Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano.</TE>
<TE>   "We were confident we'd renew with the U.S. Postal Service, but
there were other sponsors emerging," said Cindy Sisson-Hensley,
Tailwind Sports' managing director.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hand: "I don't have dollar figures to identify how much our
revenue has increased since our association with the team, but there
are a lot of ways to talk about the value of this deal outside of
revenues."</TE>
<TE>   Hand points to increased brand awareness of the Postal Service's
Global Express Guaranteed international service in foreign markets,
prominent national media coverage of Armstrong's 20-stage pursuit to
a Tour title and employee unity as the primary factors that led to a
contract that exceeds the annual value of Staples Center's naming
rights agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We're leveraging the sponsorship, defining Lance's success
because of perseverance and tenacity and signaling those same traits
in Postal Service workers," Hand said. "How a bike team works--this
handing off, the group supporting the one--is what universal postal
service is all about: that no matter where you live and no matter
what economic background you come from, you still get your mail."</TE>
<TE>   Schatz said there's too much cash involved in the deal to become
touchy-feely. He said his group has called for an outside company to
audit the Postal Service, particularly to uncover the exact financial
benefit of multi-million-dollar decisions such as the cycling
venture.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the time for the Postal Service to be throwing money
around, not when so many people in this country have opted for other
services, including electronic mail, and created losses the Postal
Services cannot recover," Schatz said. "This is when you need to look
at reducing expenditures, and a lot of other businesses have cut back
on marketing and promotion. This is not an event that's widely
popular in the U.S. Plus, who doesn't know the post office?"</TE>
<TE>   Joe Mowe, an Upland executive who said his business mails 25 to 30
envelopes daily through the Upland Post Office, said he was aware of
the three-cent stamp increase, but unaware of the $25-million
agreement for Armstrong and a Tour team that consists of six foreign
riders.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, why are they doing that?" Mowe asked. "In my own business,
we can't do that. We can't go the government and ask them for extra
money. If we're in debt, we need to stop doing some things. How can
[the Postal Service] go out and spend that? To me, it boils down to
wanting to take the competition out of business."</TE>
<TE>   In an informal survey of 10 customers at the Claremont Post
Office, nine said they knew Armstrong, but only three could identify
the Postal Service as his major sponsor. None of the 10 criticized
the magnitude of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "A three-cent increase doesn't bother me, and if they are
allocating their money correctly, that's fine with me," said Sergio
Martinez, a contractor.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Raynor, a native of England and a jeweler in Claremont, said
Armstrong's respected reputation as a courageous, strong family man
is worth such an investment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm personally not bothered by this deal at all," Raynor said.
"I'm still going to mail my letters. To me, this is like having a
beer in a pub in England. I might have to pay a little more to have
my beer in a carpeted lounge, but I choose to be comfortable. I don't
think about the small amount of extra money it's costing me. Who
cares?"</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service's strongest competitors, Federal Express and
United Parcel Service, are involved in sports sponsorship. FedEx
sponsors the CART series, the PGA Tour, French Open and has naming
rights agreements in place with the NFL's Washington Redskins and
NBA's Memphis Grizzlies. UPS sponsors NASCAR driver Dale Jarrett's
No. 88 car.</TE>
<TE>   "UPS continues to believe the Postal Service should focus on its
mission of getting its financial house in order, but this seems to be
a deal that counteracts that," UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said.
"Their core mission is universal service. Marketing these other
services, we believe, allows them to compete unfairly with private
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Hiking the prices of stamps, postcards (from 21 cents to 23 cents)
and priority mail (from $3.50 to $3.85 per pound) was approved on a
recommendation of the Postal Rate Commission by the governors of the
Postal Service on April 8. The Postal Service, which reported $11.3
billion in debt after 2001 and projected $12.9 billion at the end of
this year, estimated the postage price changes would cost each
American household 45 cents a month.</TE>
<TE>   The increases, expected to provide a $1-billion annual boost in
revenue, were said to be necessary because of the nation's economic
downturn, a substantial drop in mail advertising and terrorism
safeguards, including a $300-million anthrax cleanup. In a
third-quarter report, the agency reported it lost $281 million as
mail volume shrunk by 1.2 billion pieces from the 2001 third quarter.
The government has required since 1971 that the U.S. Postal Service
operate self-sufficiently.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Bonham, president of the sports marketing consultant firm The
Bonham Group, said, "Anyone in the consuming business who believes
the U.S. Postal Service doesn't need to market is completely
clueless. There may be the question of: How can they cut the fat?
Marketing is not fat. Marketing is part of the solution to creating
more revenue. Anybody that understands Business 101 understands
that."</TE>
<TE>   Bonham and Rick Burton, another expert in sports marketing from
the University of Oregon's Warsaw School of Marketing, said their
concern regarding the deal is why the Postal Service has been slow to
implement activation spending on consumer promotions, advertising and
hospitality opportunities that will more effectively call attention
to their link to Armstrong. Bonham said the industry standard for
activation spending is $1 to $3 for every dollar spent on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "That point is a legitimate question," Bonham said. "But,
traditionally, companies that invest in cycling with a
well-thought-out strategic plan get a strong return on their money."</TE>
<TE>   Said Burton: "I don't have a sense they're misusing the public's
trust. The Army, the Air Force and the Marines market themselves
too."</TE>
<TE>   Burton is not privy to the Postal Service's own analysis of this
deal, but he said television coverage, magazine and newspaper photos
and mention of the team in stories indicates, "the chances are they
are getting enormous return from this deal."</TE>
<TE>   Said Burton: "I think someone concluded that if the Postal Service
didn't start marketing itself more effectively, a lot of civil
servants' jobs were going to go away. So the Postal Service has
aligned itself with everyone's All-American. To the question are they
getting a good deal, my answer is yes."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INVERNESS, Fla.</DL>
<LD>In a will filed and made public Tuesday, Ted Williams said he wanted
his ashes "sprinkled at sea off the coast of Florida where the water
is very deep."</LD>
<LD>   Williams also specified that he didn't want a funeral or memorial
service.</LD>
<LD>   But after he wrote his will Dec. 20, 1996, the Hall of Famer
expressed a desire to have his body frozen, according to the executor
of the will, Albert Cassidy.</LD>
<TE>   "After the time of his will, Ted chose to have his body
cryonically preserved," Cassidy said.</TE>
<TE>   He presented no documents to support his statement and refused to
say how he knew of Williams' wish to be frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the will, Cassidy filed a petition asking a judge that
Williams' body remain in a cryonics lab in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict between Williams' will and his later wishes came
hours after his three children acknowledged they failed to resolve a
stalemate over their father's remains, perhaps setting the stage for
a contentious court battle over the will.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry Williams and Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell, his half
sister, have been fighting over their father's remains since the
Boston Red Sox great died July 5 at age 83.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had his father's body flown to Alcor Life Extension
Foundation in Scottsdale, Ariz., to be frozen, against the wishes of
Ferrell.</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Revives Buyer Interest in Religious Books</HD>
<DH>Literature: Christian publishers meeting in Anaheim say
attacks have boosted sales and presence in chains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kregel Publications has been a small Christian publisher for 50
years, but it wasn't until this spring that the Michigan company had
a bestseller--for three months straight.</LD>
<LD>   What made the difference was Sept. 11 and a controversial book on
Islam.</LD>
<LD>   "It's done a whale of a lot to get us on the radar screens of the
big retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders," said N. David Hill,
the company's executive director of sales and marketing. "Now they
know that we're a publisher with a significant work."</LD>
<TE>   That work is "Unveiling Islam: An Insider's Look at Muslim Life
and Beliefs," written by two Muslim-raised brothers who converted to
Christianity and teach theology at Baptist colleges.</TE>
<TE>   The book, described as fair and balanced by Hill but criticized as
bigoted by some Islamic scholars, was published in March. It is in
its fifth printing.</TE>
<TE>   As 12,000 members of CBA--formerly the Christian Booksellers
Assn.--meet at the Anaheim Convention Center this week, there is wide
agreement that the terrorist attacks have led to a big increase in
sales and heavier buying of religious titles by mainstream
bookstores.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a niche market anymore," said Bill Anderson,
president and chief executive of the Colorado-based organization.</TE>
<TE>   Bible sales surged after Sept. 11 and still are going strong, up
20% or more from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time there are world events that shake our faith, people turn
to the Bible for answers," said Mark Rice of Zondervan, a subsidiary
of book publisher Harper Collins.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ... the magnitude of sales--that's what has been
surprising."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Zondervan sold more than 2 million Bibles; $1
million worth of stock was shipped out shortly after the attacks on
New York and the Pentagon. Within weeks, the company was temporarily
out of copies of the best-selling book of all time.</TE>
<TE>   "An event like Sept. 11 is an opportunity," Rice said. "As a
publisher with a mission like ours, you have to take advantage of
that opportunity. If we can get Bibles in the hands of people who
need them, we have to take advantage of that."</TE>
<TE>   When Hill attended a similar Christian bookseller's convention in
January, he counted 15 new titles on Islam in a marketplace that had
supported only a few such books before.</TE>
<TE>   "I have two [mainstream retailers] coming to see me here that I
couldn't have gotten appointments with before," he saiddeclining to
identify them for competitive reasons.</TE>
<TE>   A collection of articles by Muslim women is expected from Hill's
company next year.</TE>
<TE>   To Christian publishers, the surge in sales is reflective of the
increasing crossover appeal of books with a religious message in the
secular market.</TE>
<TE>   "Sam's [Club], Wal-Mart, Target are all buying more" since Sept.
11, said Everett O'Bryan, a vice president with Tyndale House
Publishers, the Illinois company whose "Left Behind" series of
Christian novels has sold millions worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Where it used to be they were 35% to 40% of our market, now
[general booksellers] are 55% of our market. It's been a big switch."</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Anderson said many of the association's 2,443
member retailers displayed religious products with American flags and
patriotic paraphernalia, a combination that did wonders for sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Effective marketing is meeting people at their point of need," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   With the anniversary of the attacks coming up, some retailers
expect another sales surge.</TE>
<TE>   Christian Publications Inc. put out a collection of interviews
with Sept. 11 survivors and rescue workers in January. It has sold
9,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Park, the company's trade manager, said commercials on
mainstream cable-TV stations promoting the book will be broadcast in
September in New York, Washington, Pittsburgh and in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "It's done fair," Park said of the book's sales.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not in the same league with another of his titles: "Harry
Potter and the Bible," which warns of children's fascination with the
occult.</TE>
<TE>   "It sold 75,000 copies last year alone," Park said. "It's a hot
topic."</TE>

<HD>Immigration Crackdown Ineffective, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Mexico: The INS argues that its border policies have
reduced illegal entries and that the report's conclusions are skewed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON and PATRICK McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An eight-year, $20-billion campaign to strengthen enforcement along
the U.S.-Mexican border has failed to stem unauthorized immigration,
according to a study released today by the nonpartisan Public Policy
Institute of California.</LD>
<LD>   The study buttresses what immigration scholars and advocates have
been saying for years: The massive enforcement buildup along the
U.S.-Mexico border has not reduced illegal immigration. Some
border-jumpers may even have been persuaded to remain in the United
States, rather than return to Mexico, because of the difficulty and
high cost of repeat border crossings, the study concluded.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the Immigration and Naturalization Service
immediately rejected the report's conclusions. Apprehensions at the
border, recently reduced, suggest fewer migrants are trying to cross,
and longer stays in the U.S. indicate that illegal migrants are
worried that if they leave, they might not be able to get back, the
INS official argued.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers took two years to reach their conclusions, relying on
sources that included annual Mexican surveys in 18 border-crossing
communities and data from immigrants meeting in focus groups from Los
Angeles to Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Although not meeting its main goal of reducing illegal
immigration, the border crackdown has had some "tactical successes,"
including doubling the number of immigrants apprehended at the border
from 1992 to 1998, the authors found.</TE>
<TE>   Other consequences of the U.S. strategy, however, are that migrant
smuggling has become big business and that migrants have switched
their border crossings to more treacherous desert and mountain
terrain. The number of deaths from exposure and drowning has
increased dramatically--from 57 in 1994 to 227 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The beefed up Border Patrol presence has increased the price paid
smugglers, or coyotes, from about $300 a decade ago to around $2,000,
authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   The study also noted a buildup of illegal immigrants who were
coming to America to stay permanently. U.S. authorities have long
estimated that figure at about 350,000 per year, but the researchers
found the number has swelled to between 400,000 and 500,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration policy reform advocates hailed the study as an
affirmation of their long-held beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, said Christian Ramirez, director of the American
Friends Service in San Diego, is that the U.S. government is trying
to halt social and economic forces with military might.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as there is poverty in the sending nations and jobs are
available in the receiving nations, the problem will exist," Ramirez
said. "I don't care if they put 20 fences and armed guards there,
people will make their way north."</TE>
<TE>   At the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington, a
spokesman took sharp issue with the report's findings.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the
border, said INS spokesman Bill Strassberger. He noted that, after
spiking upward, apprehensions at the border have fallen steadily in
the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The fall in apprehensions is a strong indicator that fewer people
are trying to cross the border, Strassberger said. In 2000, 1.67
million people were apprehended at the nation's borders; 1.26 million
were caught in 2001; and so far this year 639,000 people have been
apprehended, putting the agency on track to detain slightly under 1
million people in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The INS statistics for apprehensions include those made at the
Canadian border, but they account for only about 15,000 yearly,
Strassberger said.</TE>
<TE>   Strassberger added that the finding that more immigrants are
staying in the north confirms how much more difficult the crossings
have become.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 Mexico census showed that only 7% of those who moved 24
months before the survey returned to Mexico within the first six
months and only 11% had returned within a year. In 1992, 20% of
people who moved to the U.S. returned to Mexico within six months of
migration.</TE>
<TE>   "If the border strategy isn't working, then people would feel free
to go and come," Strassberger said. "But they realize it's that much
harder to come across and less of a guarantee that they'll make it
back over. To us, that underscores the fact that the border strategy
is working."</TE>
<TE>   Although he agreed that migration patterns have shifted from urban
to rural areas, Strassberger said the border strategy must be
considered as a multiyear plan that has been making steady progress.</TE>
<TE>   "Will we ever seal off the border entirely? I doubt it. But the
goal is control and to restore safety to the border and quality of
life for those Americans living along the border," the INS official
said.</TE>

<HD>Borough Measure for Ballot Rejected</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Closing a chapter in the secession saga, a divided City Council
refused Tuesday to place a measure on the Nov. 5 ballot to
decentralize Los Angeles government with a system of boroughs.</LD>
<LD>   The council also rejected competing proposals calling for creation
of a largely undefined commission to study ways to improve the
structure of city government.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's votes ended two months of raucous maneuvering over
borough plans that were offered as an alternative to San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood secession initiatives.</LD>
<TE>   "We fought a good fight," said Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, who
along with council colleague Janice Hahn had introduced the borough
measure.</TE>
<TE>   "I still believe a borough-type system is the way to bring local
control to communities," Greuel said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brain, president of the secession group Valley VOTE, said
later that the council had squandered "what could be the last
opportunity to reform Los Angeles government." Valley VOTE, however,
opposed the borough plans, labeling them an attempt to confuse
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Brain said with the borough option off the table, the only
remaining way to reform the city is for voters to approve the
secession measures on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The borough and commission proposals were rejected after a
meandering, sometimes passionate debate that said as much about the
council as it did about reform.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals were brought by the council's newer members: Greuel
was in office just five weeks before she teamed with fellow newcomer
Hahn to offer a bare-bones proposal for a ballot referendum. Its
approval would have amended the City Charter to require formation of
a borough system and establish a commission to work out the details.
The plan was rejected 10 to 4 by the council.</TE>
<TE>   City Council President Alex Padilla offered what he termed a
compromise proposal--setting up an appointed commission to examine
Los Angeles government.</TE>
<TE>   That panel would have faced no deadline in its deliberations and
would have had no mandate to focus solely on boroughs or
decentralization.</TE>
<TE>   The Padilla proposal failed in a 7-7 vote.</TE>

<TE>   The two camps found little common ground during Tuesday's debate.
Amendments were developed on the fly, and much of the discussion
consisted of Nate Holden, Ruth Galanter and Hal Bernson lecturing
their newer colleagues on the art of running a city.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Padilla," Holden chided the council president at one point, "
... extend the olive branch to Ms. Hahn and Ms. Greuel, and let's
come together and have a friendly amendment and merge the two
proposals."</TE>
<TE>   Galanter took issue with the newer council members' contention
that city government should be decentralized to empower
neighborhoods. "With all due respect, I think you're headed in the
wrong direction," Galanter told Padilla, Greuel and Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   The new members would better serve their constituents by
finding--and fixing--problems in their districts, Galanter said.</TE>
<TE>   The Padilla proposal failed in a 7-7 vote.</TE>

<HD>Labor Pressures GOP on Budget</HD>
<DH>Politics: Rallies and a TV ad target voters in key
Republican districts as the Assembly wrangles over cuts and tax hikes
in overdue spending plan.</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With California's budget stalemate dragging into its third week,
special interest groups worried about the outcome are pressuring
holdout Republicans where it hurts them most: at home.</LD>
<LD>   Individual GOP legislators are being targeted by organized labor
in their home districts, where voters may not be as savvy about the
complex political fight surrounding passage of the $99-billion
spending plan.</LD>
<LD>   To get voters' attention, labor groups are organizing rallies,
including one scheduled for today in front of the Granada Hills
office of Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) and another
planned for Thursday in the San Diego area represented by
Assemblywoman Charlene Zettel (R-Poway).</LD>
<TE>   "This is how the budget could possibly get resolved ... if the
public brings pressure to bear on their elected officials," said
Jeanine Meyer Rodriguez, state council campaign coordinator for the
Service Employees International Union, which represents about 400,000
nurses, janitors and other workers.</TE>
<TE>   The budget has passed the Senate but is stalled in the Assembly,
where Republicans and Democrats are at odds over nearly $4 billion in
new taxes and other new revenue that Democrats are seeking to help
close a $23.6-billion shortfall. Republicans want deeper spending
cuts instead of tax hikes.</TE>
<TE>   The stalemate caused Gov. Gray Davis to miss a July 1 deadline for
signing a new spending package into law.</TE>
<TE>   The California Professional Firefighters waded into the fray
Tuesday by airing a television spot in the Sacramento area that
features a firefighter, images of wildfires and planes dousing flames
with chemicals. Viewers are warned that this could be the worst fire
season ever and are urged to contact local GOP legislators, Assembly
Republican leader Dave Cox and Assemblyman Anthony Pescetti, and to
ask them to do their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of election-year politics at the Capitol, some
legislators are holding up the budget," the firefighter in the ad
says. "They're pushing for across-the-board cuts that could cripple
our state firefighting services."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll Wills, a spokesman for the firefighters, said his group is
airing the spot to try to end the budget stalemate by putting
pressure on individual lawmakers via their constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "We're keenly aware of the potential impact [the television spot]
can have, and we're hoping it has it," Wills said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Pescetti was holding firm in his opposition to the
proposed spending plan, particularly the tax increases and what he
says is its failure to fix a structural problem that could cause
California to experience deficits for the next five years. Pescetti
said Republicans have never advocated or supported cuts to police or
firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how many times or how many ways I have to say, 'No,
I'm not voting for the budget,' " Pescetti said.</TE>
<TE>   In Fresno, the Service Employees International Union organized a
rally last week during which local officials called on Assemblyman
Mike Briggs (R-Fresno) to vote for the budget. Briggs noted that the
media contact for the event was based out of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're being used a little," Briggs said of the Fresno
officials who showed up at the rally.</TE>
<TE>   Briggs said the rally did nothing to weaken his opposition to the
spending plan--much to the chagrin of Fresno County Supervisor Juan
Arambula, who participated in the rally. Arambula said the lack of a
state budget is making it difficult for Fresno officials to craft a
new county budget.</TE>
<TE>   State funding for probation and children and family services
provided by the county, he added, are also being put at risk by the
delay.</TE>
<TE>   "He's playing games at the expense of his constituents," Arambula
said of Briggs. "He's decided apparently to throw his lot in with the
knuckle-dragging Neanderthals who don't really care if we have a
budget or not."</TE>
<TE>   "There are groups that have their own little needs they like taken
care of and I don't mean to belittle them," Briggs said, "but you
don't pass a $100-billion budget so that a group can get their
$200,000 issue taken care of."</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives are employing similar techniques to dissuade
Democrats in swing districts from voting for the spending plan. The
California Republican Party aired a radio ad last month in the
district of Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews (D-Tracy), urging
listeners to tell her to keep her campaign promise to stop raising
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that Gray Davis wants to hike the car tax so we pay for the
budget mess he's created, guess who he's counting on to raise taxes
again? That's right, wasteful spender Barbara Matthews," the ad said.</TE>

<HD>Joseph Burg, 80; Helped Found Machine-Tool Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph L. Burg, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Burgmaster Corp., a
company whose machines helped speed manufacturing in the 1950s, died
Saturday of a rare blood disease at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He
was 80.</LD>
<LD>   The company, started in 1944 in a Hollywood garage by Burg's
father, Fred, was the largest machine-tool manufacturer west of the
Mississippi in the 1960s. A takeover target in the 1980s, it became a
symbol of American industrial distress after it was profiled in the
1989 book "When the Machine Stopped" by historian and journalist Max
Holland.</LD>
<LD>   Burg's father was an inventor best known for developing the
Burgmaster turret drill, a labor-saving device that was seen as a
major engineering advance in the 1950s.</LD>
<TE>   Capable of doing the work of several drilling machines at once, it
became part of a revolutionary equation in manufacturing when it was
one of the first machines to be run by computer in the late 1950s. A
Burgmaster turret drill is part of the Smithsonian Institution
collection.</TE>
<TE>   Burg and his brother-in-law, Norman Ginsburg, were made partners
in the company when they were discharged from the Army in 1945. While
Ginsburg handled production, Burg concentrated on sales, a tough job
for a company seen as an upstart by the more established machine-tool
manufacturers centered in the Midwest and East.</TE>
<TE>   Burg became known as "Mr. Outside," aggressively promoting the
ability of the company to build the machines its customers needed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great salesman," said Holland, whose father worked for
Burgmaster for 29 years. "He promised a lot of things that pushed the
company to greater achievements."</TE>
<TE>   Burg was born in Chicago, where his Czech immigrant father managed
a department store. His father preferred to work with machines and in
1943, attracted by California's expanding economy, moved the family
to Los Angeles. He began drafting designs in his garage, and soon had
a patent for a tool-holding device called the Tool-Flex, the first
successful product sold by his company.</TE>
<TE>   The firm prospered through the 1950s, and opened a plant in
Gardena. Joe Burg headed sales and engineering, eventually becoming
company president when his father retired.</TE>
<TE>   With net sales of $6 million by the early 1960s, Burgmaster began
to attract suitors. In 1965, it was sold to Houdaille Industries, a
company built on its success in the auto parts business. Houdaille
quickly marginalized Burgmaster's founders and replaced its
family-style management.</TE>
<TE>   Burg was pushed out as president, and served briefly as vice
president for international sales in the Houdaille organization
before finally leaving in 1970 when, according to Holland, he could
no longer tolerate Houdaille's "narrow emphasis on the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Houdaille became the target of a leveraged buyout in 1979 by the
Wall Street firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts. The pressure to pay
off the cash debt created by what was then a record buyout was the
death knell for Burgmaster. It was closed in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Burg later joined forces with another former Burgmaster employee
to found Essay International, based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., which
imported and distributed machine tools from England and Spain.</TE>
<TE>   He also was a principal investor in Centurion Savings &amp; Loan,
which had six branches in Southern California before it was sold for
$6.5 million to Atlantic Financial in 1987. With his son, Randall, he
founded Popcal Inc., an operator of Popeye's Fried Chicken
restaurants in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   His philanthropy benefited the City of Hope, Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center and other organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Burg inherited his father's penchant for inventing. Until a few
weeks before his death, he was working on a design for a lifting
system that would help people in wheelchairs have more independence.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Burg is survived by his wife, Francine;
daughters Cindy and Bobbi; 12 grandchildren; and two
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutor Admits Dishonest Dealings in Homicide Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Justice: Ron Bamieh says his office failed to 'do the right
thing' for a woman who helped in a case not knowing she could be
charged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County prosecutor admitted Tuesday that law enforcement
officials were dishonest in their dealings with a woman who provided
key details about a 1998 slaying and was then charged with murder.</LD>
<LD>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Bamieh told a judge presiding over
Bridget Callahan's preliminary hearing that his office failed to "do
the right thing" by not offering Callahan a deal in return for her
cooperation.</LD>
<LD>   "We should have dealt her out prior to the grand jury," Bamieh
testified. "It was a no-brainer."</LD>
<TE>   At issue is whether authorities improperly coerced Callahan to
talk about the slaying of 17-year-old Nichole Hendrix of Ventura and
whether an agreement that Callahan signed in December 1999 is valid.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan, a 30-year-old Ventura resident, alleges that prosecutors
promised her immunity in exchange for her statements and told her she
need not consult a lawyer before signing the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   She was later indicted on charges of first-degree murder along
with two skinhead gang members she implicated in the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Called as a defense witness Tuesday, Bamieh, who was removed from
the case after announcing his candidacy for district attorney last
fall, denied that anyone coerced Callahan or gave false promises.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged that law enforcement officials were "less than
honest" with Callahan and never corrected her misconceptions that she
was a witness and not a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my opinion that she didn't understand that she was
culpable for the murder of Ms. Hendrix," Bamieh testified. "All of us
knew, or believed, that she didn't understand that she had confessed
to a murder."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh and a district attorney's investigator flew to Arizona in
October 1999 to talk to Callahan about an unrelated murder case and
learned she had information about the Hendrix slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, Hendrix volunteered to tell authorities details
of the killing in return for them moving her to another state.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh testified that based on information uncovered during the
homicide investigation, he believed Callahan was culpable as an
accessory after the fact for helping dispose of Hendrix's body.</TE>
<TE>   But after hearing her account, Bamieh said, he realized that
Callahan was liable for first-degree murder for drugging Hendrix and
standing guard while the two skinheads killed her.</TE>
<TE>   "I never in my wildest dreams thought she was going to say what
she told us," he testified.</TE>
<TE>   According to Callahan's account, the men stabbed and beat Hendrix
to death in a motel bathroom after becoming suspicious that she had
reported them to police for selling stolen goods.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said that the day after Callahan gave her statement he
discussed the situation with Ron Janes, then his supervisor in the
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Janes said, 'Let the Sheriff's Department work her and help
them only when they ask,' " Bamieh testified.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives and investigators for both agencies later went on to
use Callahan as an informant, even though they knew she was a murder
suspect and not a witness, Bamieh said.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan was later indicted for murder. She has been held at the
county jail without bail for nearly two years.</TE>
<TE>   After the August indictment, Bamieh said, he encouraged his
supervisors to let Callahan plea to a lesser charge. They eventually
offered to let Callahan plea guilty to second-degree murder, but she
refused.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan's case has since been turned over to the state attorney
general at the request of the Ventura County district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, defense attorney Joseph O'Neill questioned Bamieh
about his dealings with Callahan and his opinions of the agreement
crafted by law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Seven months ago, O'Neill suggested in court papers that Bamieh
intentionally deceived Callahan for his own political gain.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill described Bamieh's dealings with Callahan as "a Faustian
bargain for favorable publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh called O'Neill "a nut" who had no evidence to back up his
claims.</TE>

Regional Park near Costa Mesa on Tuesday will be investigated by the
Orange County Fire Authority as arson. "It definitely was set, but we
don't know who caused it," said Keith Fujimoto, a battalion chief of
the Costa Mesa Fire Department. The fire started about 3 p.m. and was
spread by winds. About 100 fire personnel from several agencies,
along with two helicopter crews, were able to put the fire out by 6
p.m., he said.</CP>

<HD>Using Summer to Spring Ahead for the Fall</HD>
<DH>Korean American parents enroll students in hagwons to give
them an academic advantage. Tutorial programs now include sports,
activities.</DH>

<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Timothy Yu shuffled his feet, looking a little embarrassed by the
question.</LD>
<LD>   So how did the 11-year-old fifth-grader do in school this past
year?</LD>
<LD>   "Not too well," he answered, shaking his head and squinting his
gentle eyes. "Four A's, two Bs."</LD>
<TE>   In the pursuit of academic success--or perfection in Timothy's
case--there is little time to while away, even during summer
vacation.</TE>
<TE>   So while some parents are taking their children to an amusement
park or dropping them off at summer camp, Timothy's are delivering
him to the Fullerton Tutors, a hagwon in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Hagwons, tutorial schools that offer summer and after-school
programs, are an age-old tradition in Korea, where most children
attend some sort of extracurricular academic program. In a culture
deeply rooted in Confucian reverence for scholastic achievement,
hagwons provide the edge many parents believe their children need to
move ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The institution has become common in Korean American communities
as well. Korean business directories list more than 100 academic
hagwons in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Those schools' monthly charges range from $300 for after-school
programs to $700 for full-day summer classes and recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Some hagwons offer golf lessons and others SAT preparation. But
academic hagwons that specialize in languages, math and sciences are
by far the most popular in the United States and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Parents, said Kathleen Rhee, who founded Fullerton Tutors 15 years
ago, "want their children to be prepared and be confident in the next
level."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike students at other summer schools who are, for the most
part, studying to catch up, Timothy and his classmates are looking to
be ahead of their peers come fall.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent English class at Tutors, three boys and six girls,
ages 11 to 13, were learning compound words and dissecting a summary
biography of Helen Keller.</TE>
<TE>   "Who would guess that the charming, erudite woman," the biography
read, "could neither see nor hear."</TE>
<TE>   The lesson is designed for seventh-graders, said Carol Brem, the
English instructor. Most of her pupils have just completed sixth
grade; Timothy, who is among them, is yet to start sixth grade.</TE>
<TE>   "They are quite remarkable," said Brem, 55, who teaches at San
Dimas High School during the school year. "Their parents want them to
be challenged. The expectation is there and they understand."</TE>
<TE>   Brem added: "They are typical kids in terms of not wanting
homework and complaining about lessons being hard. Still, if I told
my own children at that age that this is what they would be doing
during summer, they'd say, 'You've got to be kidding.' "</TE>
<TE>   The school, a spartan two-story building inside a Fullerton
business complex, is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. during summer.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Brem's classroom, there was little to distract the students
from the task at hand. They sat on folding chairs around a table, a
single skylight giving hint of the hot summer day outside.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, students wrestled with words like "resolute,"
"inordinate," "inconsolable" and "industrious."</TE>
<TE>   "What is 'industrious?' " one student wanted to know.</TE>
<TE>   "It means hard-working," Brem answered. "Like you guys. You are
all hard-working."</TE>
<TE>   Smiles broke around the room.</TE>
<TE>   But there was nothing funny about homework. When Brem told her
students to mark two pages in their grammar book, Timothy wanted to
know: "Is that homework?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Brem said, the lessons would be tackled in class the next
day</TE>
<TE>   "Yeeees," the relieved boys said, pumping their fists low.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Tutors parents pay $600 to $700 a month during summer
and $350 to $400 a month for after-school programs during the school
year, Rhee said. She employs 10 part-time instructors and has 50 to
70 students.</TE>
<TE>   The students, primary graders mostly, study for three hours in the
mornings in small groups. After lunch, about half opt to stay for
field trips and other nonacademic activities like tennis and skating
lessons.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, Rhee tries to infuse some fun into her
students' lives. Recently, the school went to watch a Disney movie at
the historic El Capitan theater in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "With many of our students, both parents work," Rhee said. "And we
offer full-time care. Something for the body and something for the
mind."</TE>
<TE>   Hagwons increasingly are adding recreation to pure academics to
adapt to American expectations, said Kyeyoung Park, a UCLA professor
of anthropology and Asian American studies who was born in Korea and
follows education trends there and in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Korean education culture, with its heavy emphasis on academic
success, "has led to productive students," Park said, "but in terms
of creativity and critical thinking, they've lagged behind."</TE>
<TE>   Korean parents on both sides of the Pacific are beginning to
wonder whether they are driving their children too hard, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But it is difficult for parents to measure just how much is too
much motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "What I tell them is that if they try their best, I'll be happy,"
said Mariann Yu, 41, Timothy's mother. Her daughter Rachel, 13, also
attends Fullerton Tutors. Still, she said, when she sees other
parents filling every free hour of their children's time, "I get
scared that I am not doing enough."</TE>
<TE>   Timothy and his sister don't attend hagwon during the school year,
Yu said. And early last school year, Yu made a deal with her son that
"if he made two honor rolls, he didn't have to go to summer school."</TE>
<TE>   Timothy made three, Yu said. But ultimately Yu and her husband
decided that a hagwon would be more productive than something that
was "just fun" like summer camp.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to convince him at first, but he's actually enjoying
himself," said Yu. Rachel and Timothy "like everything, except the
homework."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Timothy said he doesn't much mind the hagwon. Yes,
he could live without the homework, but he likes the field trips to
parks and libraries.</TE>
<TE>   "I like going to different places," he said, "seeing different
worlds."</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Acts to Tighten Control of Cyber Cafes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana is curtailing the hours that cyber cafes can operate and
requiring owners to use surveillance cameras in an effort to prevent
violence.</LD>
<LD>   The ordinance passed by the City Council on Monday night comes
just weeks after Garden Grove tightened its laws regulating similar
businesses that rent computers, often to young people who play
computer games and chat with friends online. One young man was killed
June 8 in Garden Grove after leaving a cyber cafe.</LD>
<LD>   While Santa Ana's four cyber cafes have generated noise and
loitering, no major crimes have been reported. Santa Ana Police Sgt.
Baltazar De La Riva said the city wanted to be proactive and to cover
businesses not regulated by current ordinances.</LD>
<TE>   "There's enough indication of possible problems that we wanted to
get on it," City Manager David Ream said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   No opposition has surfaced so far among local club owners,
contrary to what has occurred in Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no problems with this," said David Hong, manager of cyber
cafe 3D PC in west Santa Ana. "We were going to close around 10 p.m.
anyway. We did have some problems with kids fighting, but it wasn't
anything."</TE>
<TE>   The new ordinance, which took effect Tuesday, requires cyber cafes
to close by 10 p.m., close to minors by 8 p.m. and to install
surveillance cameras. The measure will be evaluated for 45 days, and
then be retooled if needed. The council would vote again on the
ordinance in 45 days.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana's action comes a week after Garden Grove required cafes
to close at 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and at midnight Friday
and Saturday. Minors are not allowed after 8 p.m. Previously, cafes
could stay open until 2 a.m. Now they need surveillance cameras and
security guards at night.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove's 19 cyber cafe owners are considering legal
challenges. "This is a free country and we are responsible
businessmen," said John Pham, owner of cafe Xtreme PC. "The problem
is not the cyber cafes; it is gangs. The city should work on that
problem and let us do business."</TE>
<TE>   But Garden Grove Mayor Bruce Broadwater said, "We have a right to
enforce our laws. We did have a shooting here. We enforce liquor
laws, laws at pool halls too."</TE>

<HD>Mayor's Style Is Praised, Criticized</HD>
<DH>Inglewood: Unwavering Dorn has been in the national
spotlight since taped police beating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn gave the tempered approach one try.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with an angry crowd in his City Hall office last week, Dorn
at first told the protesters he thought Jeremy J. Morse, the officer
captured on videotape manhandling an Inglewood teenager, should be
suspended without pay. That did not go far enough for the crowd,
however; one demonstrator shouted his unhappiness, and the rest of
the group grumbled with disapproval.</LD>
<LD>   It was then that Dorn abandoned the measured remarks to do what,
through a long and varied career in the public eye, he has almost
always done--speak his mind.</LD>
<TE>   Surrounded by a brace of news cameras, Dorn ripped Morse's conduct
as inexcusable. In his opinion, the former judge and prosecutor said,
Morse had committed felony assault, assault with a deadly weapon,
battery and child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of conduct cannot be tolerated anywhere in the United
States and especially in my city," Dorn said. "Especially in my
city."</TE>
<TE>   That moment was pure Dorn, according to Edward Humes, an author
who spent months in Dorn's juvenile courtroom in the mid-'90s while
researching a book on the juvenile justice system.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out shooting from the hip and said what he thought,
whereas 99% of the mayors in the country would be worried about
possible liability," Humes said.</TE>
<TE>   Although some have questioned Dorn's comments--his own police
chief, Ronald Banks, advised officials against passing judgment on
the case--Najee Ali, an activist who has harshly criticized Morse,
credited the mayor with defusing an angry protest.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Mayor Dorn's finest moment. He showed bold and courageous
leadership and had real sense of the pulse of this city," Ali said.
"The way tempers were rising, I really feel like he prevented a
possible riot."</TE>
<TE>   Dorn has lived in California for more than 40 years, arriving here
from Oklahoma in 1960. Since then, he has worked as a postal clerk,
deputy sheriff, prosecutor, judge and mayor. He first drew public
attention during his years as a crusading juvenile court judge, and
Dorn said his style remains unwavering.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't change because I change jobs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, close associates say that except for the gray hairs that
seem to have finally taken a prolonged battle for his once
salt-and-pepper beard and low afro, the flinty-eyed 66-year-old
doesn't seem to change at all.</TE>
<TE>   As a young prosecutor and then as a Superior Court judge, Dorn
became convinced that the best way to turn lives around was to
intervene early. He served two stints on the juvenile court bench--in
1982-89 and 1994-96--where he developed a reputation as a stern,
relentless monitor of the young people who came before him.</TE>
<TE>   He kept youths on probation for years, demanded frequent progress
reports and laced his proceedings with sermonizing.</TE>
<TE>   "Rarely a day went by without seeing him dress down a kid, a
witness or a prosecutor," Humes said. "Usually it was all three."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Dorn's tactics were criticized as skirting the limits of
what was legal; he was so unwilling to try juvenile offenders as
adults that the L.A. County district attorney's office worked to
prevent him from hearing "fitness" cases in which such determinations
were made.</TE>
<TE>   Public defenders joined prosecutors in boycotting Dorn's
courtroom, in their case because they found his monitoring of
juvenile offenders oppressive. Dorn's response was to invoke an
obscure provision in state law that allows parents to petition the
Juvenile Court to take charge of troubled children--even if they've
committed no crime. He threw open the doors to his courtroom to any
parent exasperated enough to submit a child to his personal brand of
justice. They flocked to the "hanging judge," as some called him.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Dorn's tactics irritated other members of the bench,
and in 1989 the presiding judge removed him from juvenile proceedings
and transferred him to downtown Superior Court. Dorn chafed in that
post for four years. When a new presiding judge took over and
reassigned him to juvenile court, an unbowed Dorn picked up right
where he had left off.</TE>
<TE>   That willingness to test the limits of his authority--whatever his
capacity--is both Dorn's greatest strength and his greatest weakness,
according to those who have known him for years. Detractors see it as
a tendency to be autocratic and irresponsible, supporters as the mark
of a leader guided by unwavering principles.</TE>
<TE>   In the current case, for instance, some welcome his defense of
16-year-old Donovan Jackson, but others accuse him of abandoning the
police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Critics like Roy Burns, president of the Assn. for Los Angeles
Deputy Sheriffs, say Dorn should have held his tongue until an
investigation was completed. "It does nothing but inflame the
community when they see their leader criticizing a police officer
before all the facts are in," Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   But where Burns sees a rush to judgment, supporters such as
Michael Benbow, 53, see determination. Benbow's backing for Dorn goes
back years, beginning with a chance observation of the judge in
action and ending up in an enduring friendship.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, as a board member of a youth sports league in
Watts, Benbow was asked to notify Dorn that he had been nominated for
an award for his dedication to young people.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to get an audience with the busy judge was to sit in
his courtroom and wait for a break in the proceedings. It was while
Benbow waited that he got a sense of the world according to Dorn.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very strict in the way he carries out his business, very
upfront," Benbow said. "Sometimes it seems abrasive, but it's the way
business has to be carried out."</TE>
<TE>   Benbow was so impressed that he eventually worked on his mayoral
campaign, and the two struck up a friendship.</TE>
<TE>   Today, as Dorn grapples with Inglewood's sudden emergence into the
glare of national attention over a beating by one of its police
officers, the mayor exudes an air of authority aided by a gravelly,
theatric baritone--his cadences honed by 18 years on the bench and 20
as a lay minister. And while he views the roles of judge, minister
and mayor as "entirely compatible," others find his personality
ill-suited for elective office.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, a judge can do pretty much whatever he wants in
the courtroom," said Paul Russell, a political activist who has lived
in Inglewood for 26 years. "Dorn is a very personable individual, but
he tends to be dictatorial. He's still acting as a judge when he's in
council chambers."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the pressures of the police case have forced Dorn to move
nimbly in recent days. While he repeatedly castigates Morse, for
instance, Dorn staunchly defends the Inglewood Police Department,
refusing to echo calls for a broad investigation and lauding the
department at every opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   He also has tried to walk a fine line between expressing his views
of Morse's actions while simultaneously stressing that the legal
system needs to run its course.</TE>
<TE>   "This officer has the same constitutional rights that every
citizen that's complaining about this conduct have, and I will fight
to see that those rights are preserved," he said. "But I did not give
up the right to my personal opinion when I became mayor."</TE>

<HD>DWP May Be Held in Contempt by Senate</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Panel says utility failed to deliver
documents subpoenaed in probe of the state's electricity crisis. Vote
on charge is set for August.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Senators moved Tuesday to hold the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power in contempt for failing to deliver subpoenaed documents,
saying the city-owned utility is either a poorly run outfit or is
intentionally hindering an investigation of its behavior during the
electricity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   A Senate committee investigating manipulation of California's
power market heard staff describe more than 40 letters or phone
conversations with DWP and the Los Angeles city attorney's office in
the last year in an effort to get documents related to the
electricity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Other publicly owned utilities have complied with the committee's
request, but DWP has offered resistance comparable to that of
now-bankrupt Enron Corp., said Senate investigators.</LD>
<TE>   "The quandary that I have," said Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside),
vice chairman of the committee, "is whether or not this lack of
compliance thus far is the result of an intentional strategy ... or
representative of a disorganized and dysfunctional organization."</TE>
<TE>   The panel, the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price
Manipulation, lacked a quorum and thus could not vote on a contempt
charge. But Chairman Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said the panel will vote
on the contempt motion in the first week of August, when senators
return from vacation.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature last approved a charge of contempt in 1929, when
several executives of a cement company were sent to jail for refusing
to cooperate in a price-fixing investigation. The Supreme Court later
voided the contempt citations.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate committee has threatened Enron and DWP several times
with contempt charges, which could carry financial or other
penalties. Each time, Enron and DWP have offered the committee
renewed cooperation. A contempt charge related to the electricity
crisis investigation has yet to be taken up by the full Senate.</TE>
<TE>   DWP General Manager David H. Wiggs and Chief Assistant City Atty.
Philip Shiner promised the committee Tuesday that the department
would deliver 15,000 e-mails related to DWP electricity sales by the
end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to make this right and get it done," said Wiggs, who
was not in charge of the utility during the power crisis of 2000 and
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We have absolutely no reason not to. It's in my best interest,
it's in the mayor's best interest, he's given me that direction and
we'll get these answers to you and whatever answers you need to
complete this process."</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs told the committee that he was "disturbed by what I hear"
about DWP's failure to comply with the committee's request.</TE>
<TE>   "The report I get from our city attorney differs dramatically from
what you hear," he said. Wiggs said he may be to blame for not
grasping that his agency had a major problem with the Senate
committee, and added that the layoffs of roughly 2,000 employees
several years ago left the utility less able to deal with the
labor-intensive retrieval of records.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn called it "offensive" that Los Angeles City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo did not appear at Tuesday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt the proverbial captain of the ship ought to be here to
answer the questions," Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's committee requested documents from DWP in June 2001. By
November, according to Senate investigators, DWP had delivered five
boxes of poorly indexed documents, compared with 132 boxes of highly
organized material delivered by the smaller Sacramento Municipal
Utility District.</TE>

<LD>Alarmed by record amounts of money spent on behalf of candidates in
last year's city elections, the Los Angeles Ethics Commission voted
Tuesday to require fuller disclosure of those indirect donations.</LD>
<LD>   Those "astronomical" amounts were not spent to make the
contributors feel good, commission President Miriam Krinsky said.
"They were made in an attempt to influence decision-making."</LD>
<LD>   The commission also asked elected officials to voluntarily abstain
from voting on matters that involve people who have independently
spent large amounts on their campaigns.</LD>
<TE>   Under city election laws, campaign contributions are limited to
$1,000 for mayoral contests and $500 for City Council races. But
individuals, businesses, unions and political parties can spend an
unlimited amount on an independent campaign to benefit a candidate,
as long as they do not coordinate the effort with the candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, independent expenditures totaled a record $3.2 million,
compared with $36.6 million spent by the candidates themselves from
direct political contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Laws now require that independent expenditures be disclosed. But
they do not require disclosure of contacts between those supporters
and the officials who benefit. Nor do they require disclosure when
issues involving the backers come before those officials.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners recommended changing that. They proposed that
the City Council pass an ordinance requiring anyone who spends
$25,000 on an independent campaign in support of a council candidate,
or $100,000 in a mayor's race, to disclose when a lobbyist for the
spender contacts the elected official in the following 12 months or
when an issue the spender is a party to comes up for a vote before
the elected official.</TE>
<TE>   "It will cast more of a public light on the relationships that
exist by mandating disclosure," Krinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also approved a resolution, which does not require
council approval, urging elected city officials to avoid taking part
in any decisions that they know involve those who contributed to
independent campaigns on their behalf.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Bid by Ex-N.Y. Chief OK by Hahn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said Tuesday that he welcomes William
Bratton's interest in the LAPD's chief position, but added that he is
not favoring the former New York Police Department commissioner over
any other candidate.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to wait until the Police Commission decides who those
final three candidates are," Hahn said. "I'm certainly interested in
making sure we get all the best candidates we can get. If Mr. Bratton
decides to apply, that's great.</LD>
<LD>   "We want this to be a competitive process. We are looking for the
best person we can find."</LD>
<TE>   Bratton, whose leadership of the NYPD made him one of the nation's
best-known police commanders, stepped down last week from the team
monitoring the Los Angeles Police Department because he is
considering entering the race to become the city's next chief.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton is expected to announce this week whether he will seek the
LAPD post. He said that before reaching a final decision, he wanted
to discuss the matter with his wife, New York City criminal defense
attorney Rikki Klieman.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a two-career family," Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hahn was noncommittal about whether he would support
Bratton, he said he has been impressed by the New Yorker's
accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "Not many people can name police chiefs in America," Hahn said.
"His is a name that people know."</TE>
<TE>   During Bratton's tenure as the New York police commissioner, the
Big Apple's crime rate dropped dramatically. Although the reasons for
that decline remain the subject of debate, New York's policing
strategies have been widely emulated.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton resigned from the NYPD commissioner's post in 1996, saying
he was pursuing opportunities in the private sector but amid reports
that he and then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani were at odds.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials began the process of looking for a new
police chief in April after the Police Commission voted to deny
then-Chief Bernard Parks' request for a second five-year term. Friday
is the deadline for candidates to apply for the job.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission is expected to narrow the list to three
candidates. Hahn then will name his choice for the job, subject to
City Council confirmation.</TE>

<HD>Case Against UC Davis Researcher Reduced</HD>
<DH>Courts: Asian Americans have rallied around Bin Han,
originally accused by campus authorities of felony trade espionage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WOODLAND, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In a case that has rallied California's Asian community, the
high-profile trade secrets prosecution of a Chinese American
researcher at UC Davis was reduced Tuesday from a felony to a
misdemeanor embezzlement charge.</LD>
<LD>   As Asian American and UC employees union protesters gathered
outside the Yolo County Courthouse, Superior Court Judge Thomas E.
Warriner said at a hearing that the state failed to prove that 20
vials of human protein material allegedly stolen by researcher Bin
Han, a naturalized American citizen from China, were worth the $400
necessary to constitute a felony charge.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling marked another setback for UC Davis authorities who had
originally accused Han of stealing invaluable scientific research
materials with the intention of exporting them to China.</LD>
<TE>   After being fired from his $30,000-a-year research job in a Davis
lab, where he had worked for 12 years, Han was arrested May 17 and
held without bail in a Yolo County isolation cell for more than two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The state authorities, claiming that Han posed a risk of flight,
also confiscated his U.S. passport.</TE>
<TE>   But the trade espionage charges were dropped by the Yolo County
district attorney's office in June after it was discovered that
protein materials similar to those allegedly taken by Han were
readily available in the world market. Tuesday's ruling by Warriner
that the materials in question were not even that valuable knocked
the case against Han down another notch.</TE>
<TE>   Asian American activists cited parallels with the botched 1999
federal espionage case against Los Alamos National Laboratories
nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee. The activists contend that the Han case
represents another example of suspicions and prejudice against
Asians, particularly Chinese Americans, involved in scientific
research.</TE>
<TE>   "Would a French American or a Canadian American be considered a
flight risk?" asked Ivy Lee, a retired university sociology professor
who is president of the Sacramento-based Chinese American Political
Action Committee, one of the groups that has taken up the Han cause.</TE>
<TE>   Several protesters paraded outside the courthouse carrying signs
that said: "I'm Asian American. I must be a flight risk. Deny me bail
too."</TE>
<TE>   Han, a soft-spoken medical researcher from the western Chinese
city of Xian who lives in Davis with his wife and two school-age
children, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. He claims the
dispute with the university began with petty rivalries over where his
name should be placed in a published research article.</TE>
<TE>   Han said he put the vials of protein material in his home freezer,
where he forgot about them because he was in a rush to pick up his
children at school.</TE>
<TE>   Following the dispute over authorship of the research paper, Han
said he was told by his research supervisors on May 13 that the grant
under which his work was conducted was being discontinued.</TE>
<TE>   Han, who has filed a formal grievance with the university over his
dismissal, said he fired off an angry e-mail the next day to Dr. Ivan
Schwab, his supervisor at the UC Davis ophthalmology department. In
the e-mail, he claimed he had been asked to participate in human
corneal research for two years that had not received full Federal
Drug Administration approval.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Han claims, he was viewed suspiciously by some
research associates as a whistle-blower. Three days later, he was
arrested at his home in a midnight raid by UC Davis police.</TE>
<TE>   "What began as a big espionage case has now been reduced to the
level of petty theft," said Han's attorney, Stewart Katz. The judge
set a hearing on the misdemeanor charges next week.</TE>

<HD>$160,000 Raised for Hollywood City Campaign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood secession leaders said Tuesday that they raised nearly
$160,000 at their first fund-raising meeting, mostly from within
their own ranks.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the money has been pledged and not yet received, they
said.</LD>
<LD>   Still, their announcement was the first sign of a significant cash
infusion to the secession campaigns in Hollywood or the San Fernando
Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, who has vowed to raise $5 million to fight
secession, raised $200,000 in a single dinner last month.</TE>
<TE>   Gene La Pietra, president and founder of Hollywood VOTE, anted up
$70,000 after agreeing to match other contributions. The millionaire
nightclub owner, who wants to be mayor of an independent Hollywood,
said he already has contributed well over $500,000 to the secession
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the other donations to the recently formed Hollywood
Independence Committee came from Hollywood VOTE board members.</TE>
<TE>   Ferris Wehbe, a board member and former president of Hollywood
VOTE who owns a private school, contributed $23,000. Ed Dilkes,
another board member and the city manager of Bradbury, gave $20,000,
as did board member Jeff Luster, a commercial real estate developer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was incredible," Wehbe said. "It was the best meeting we've
ever had. People really dug deep into their pockets and gave."</TE>
<TE>   Other donors include board members Jim Meinel and Leo Sorzano, who
each gave $5,000, and board members Jeff Zarrinnam and Doug Clary ,
who each gave $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Jimenez, a spokeswoman for the Hollywood secession
campaign, gave $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   The secession group Valley VOTE has declined to release
fund-raising information.</TE>

<HD>Father Testifies on Beating</HD>
<DH>Inglewood: Lawyer details new allegations of youth's
mistreatment at the hands of a deputy. Sheriff says he was unaware of
the charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA and STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coby Chavis, the father of the 16-year-old beaten last week during a
traffic stop in Inglewood, made new allegations Tuesday that his son
had been mistreated by a sheriff's deputy as well as Inglewood
police.</LD>
<LD>   Through his lawyer, Milton Grimes, Chavis gave his account
immediately after testifying before grand jurors investigating the
case.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Chavis just finished testifying before the grand jury, but
we, I, cannot talk about his testimony" because of secrecy rules,
Grimes told reporters. He then detailed what Chavis claims to have
seen during the incident.</LD>
<TE>   According to Chavis' account, his son had complied with a deputy's
order to sit in a patrol car, then stood when Inglewood police
officers arrived. In response, Sheriff's Deputy Carlos Lopez choked
Donovan Jackson, Grimes said. That, in turn, incited Inglewood police
officers to beat the boy, Grimes said.</TE>
<TE>   A portion of the incident was caught on videotape, leading to a
week of protests against alleged police misconduct in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Lee Baca said Tuesday that he was unaware of allegations
of wrongdoing by any deputies. Officials could not be reached for
comment on specific allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Sheriff Dennis Dahlman provided the department's account
to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Tuesday, who asked him
pointed questions about the case. Board members also criticized Dist.
Atty. Steve Cooley for the arrest of the bystander who videotaped the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   Although sheriff's deputies do not patrol in Inglewood, the
officers were passing through the city when they "found it necessary
to run the plate" from Chavis' car, Dahlman said. He added that he
did not know the reason for running the license plate.</TE>
<TE>   While deputies were talking to Chavis, who was stopped at an
Inglewood gas station, Jackson returned from buying a bag of potato
chips inside the market and tried to get into his father's car.</TE>
<TE>   In a report, Lopez wrote that he tried to get Jackson to stand
back and ordered him to sit in his patrol car while his partner wrote
Chavis a ticket. According to Lopez, Jackson did not reply or
comply--a slow response which his family attributes to a hearing and
speech impairment.</TE>
<TE>   Dahlman said Inglewood officers arrived on the scene at that point
but did not get involved until they saw Jackson bump up against
Lopez. The city officers took that as a much more threatening move
than Lopez did, Dahlman said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said he "took him to the ground" and handcuffed the
teenager, who struggled against him and the Inglewood officers.
Inglewood police reports indicate one Inglewood officer punched
Jackson twice before he was handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department has been investigating the incident as a
use of force, and interviews with deputies and witnesses so far have
corroborated the written reports that deputies made about the
incident, Dahlman told the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators are searching for other witnesses through
credit card receipts and license plate numbers they are attempting to
glean from the gas station's surveillance tape. That tape captured
the entire altercation, but is of poor quality, Dahlman said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Chavis' account, he tried to go to his son after
officers put Jackson on the ground. Chavis alleges officers took him
to the ground, with one calling Chavis "the N-word," Grimes said.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, a bystander, Mitchell Crooks began taping the
scene. His video caught Inglewood officers slamming the handcuffed
youth against a police car and hitting him in the face.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, supervisors requested weekly reports from the
Sheriff's Department on the progress of the internal probe. FBI
officials and the Justice Department also are investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Gloria Molina also
criticized Cooley for the decision to arrest Crooks Thursday after he
failed to appear before the grand jury with his tape.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks, who was outside CNN's Los Angeles studios at the time, was
arrested on an outstanding warrant from Placer County.</TE>
<TE>   "It is almost as horrifying as the tape Mr. Crooks took," Molina
said of television images of the cameraman being shoved into a police
car. She also criticized Cooley's refusal to discuss the case with
the board.</TE>
<TE>   "All we have left is a tape showing his officers nearly roughing
up this individual," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Burke added that she was stunned that "with the world watching ...
our district attorney would get himself in that kind of a position,
giving L.A. County a pretty bad name."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the board, Cooley defended his investigators,
saying it would be a crime not to arrest someone sought on a warrant.</TE>
<TE>   "I am completely satisfied with the conduct of the involved
district attorney investigators. I am personally proud of their
efforts," Cooley wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Cooley insisted Crooks created the situation by
refusing to honor a subpoena to appear before the grand jury unless
prosecutors got Placer County to drop pending criminal charges of
petty theft and drunk driving.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks is in jail in Placer County, and his lawyer did not return
calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors also criticized what they called the failure of the
Sheriff's Department to correct systemic problems.</TE>
<TE>   That failure has led to millions of dollars in lawsuits for strip
searches at the county jail, improper use of force and other
incidents by "bad apples," they said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're worried about your budget?" asked Burke, alluding to the
department's deficit, now estimated at $60 million to $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This is your budget," she said, waving a two-inch-thick stack of
papers, excessive-force lawsuits filed against the department last
month alone.</TE>

<HD>Merger of LAPD, LAX Police Opposed</HD>
<DH>Agencies: The Airport Commission says July 4 killings show
it must control on-site security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Setting the stage for a possible showdown between city agencies, the
Airport Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to oppose merging the
police department that patrols Los Angeles International Airport with
the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   Several city leaders resurrected an on-again, off-again discussion
about combining the two departments after the fatal Fourth of July
shooting at LAX that left three dead, including the Egyptian gunman,
and several wounded.</LD>
<LD>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso said a merger of the two
agencies would lead to a more efficient use of limited city
resources. City Councilman Jack Weiss asked the airport agency and
the LAPD to report to the council on the matter in two months.</LD>
<TE>   But airport commissioners, who are appointed by Mayor James K.
Hahn, emphasized Tuesday that events such as the Independence Day
shooting illustrate the necessity of a separate airport police force.</TE>
<TE>   "As an individual and a commissioner, I have full confidence in
the airport police," said Commissioner Leland Wong.</TE>
<TE>   "The events of July 4 demonstrate that the airport police are more
than prepared, and that they need to be under our control."</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners unanimously passed a resolution that allows the
airport agency to retain control of an autonomous police force as
provided by the City Charter. The resolution states that there are
"too many risks involved" with merging the airport police and the
LAPD, and that "any potential benefits are exaggerated or
speculative."</TE>
<TE>   Merging the airport police and the LAPD would require a charter
amendment and voter approval.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, who said he thinks it's important to review the two-agency
approach to policing LAX in part because of new security concerns
stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks, was critical of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Where I come from, analysis precedes conclusions and not vice
versa," he said. "The fact that they've circled the bureaucratic
wagons this early in the process makes it all the more important that
we get to the bottom of this issue."</TE>
<TE>   The airport police force employs 240 sworn officers and 200
unarmed security officers at LAX. The LAPD has 74 officers stationed
there. In addition, Hahn has asked the airport agency to pay 60
off-duty LAPD officers overtime to patrol airport grounds until
January.</TE>
<TE>   City officials tried unsuccessfully several times in the last
decade to merge the two departments.</TE>
<TE>   The airport police department was established in 1946. It was
given full authority to patrol the airport in 1968 because the LAPD
didn't have the resources to watch the airfield and its perimeter and
to write traffic citations, airport officials said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County health officials said Tuesday that their failure
to publicize a recent Legionnaires' disease outbreak at a hospital
was an isolated incident.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, director of the Department of Health
Services, told the county Board of Supervisors that he has reviewed
all disease outbreaks from the past year and concluded that his
agency is not withholding information from the public about any major
health concern.</LD>
<LD>   Garthwaite and his staff have been sharply criticized by
supervisors for the department's handling of the Legionnaires'
outbreak at Good Samaritan Hospital in downtown Los Angeles between
January and June.</LD>
<TE>   Nine people became infected with the respiratory ailment at the
hospital, including two who later died. Good Samaritan officials have
said the two infected patients who died had serious heart problems,
and that Legionnaires' disease did not play a role in the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   No new Legionnaires' infections have been reported at Good
Samaritan since last month. Health officials said they knew of no
clusters of Legionnaires' infections anywhere else in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Legionnaires', which can cause death in 5% to 30% of cases, cannot
be transmitted from person to person. Patients contract the disease
by inhaling water droplets or mist contaminated with the Legionella
pneumophila bacteria. Some research has suggested that
air-conditioning units, showers, water towers and mist machines
spread the bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   While he said authorities should have alerted the public sooner,
Garthwaite also said that his department's acute communicable disease
control unit responded swiftly and appropriately.</TE>
<TE>   That unit worked with the hospital to take such steps as testing
and decontaminating its water system, serving bottled water to
patients and changing some shower heads.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some real smart people," Garthwaite said. "They were
just doing their job, not thinking about the public notification
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Some county public health workers still maintain that the public
did not need to be notified of the outbreak. The county acknowledged
the cluster at Good Samaritan on June 30 after The Times learned of
it through an anonymous tip.</TE>
<TE>   The outbreak "did not threaten the health of either the general
public or visitors to the hospital," wrote Dr. Shirley Fannin,
director of disease control programs, in a letter to the supervisors'
offices. "This hysteria about Legionella infection from one location
is very misplaced" because steps were taken to contain it.</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan is in the process of notifying all new patients
about its response to the cases.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital attempted unsuccessfully to eliminate the Legionella
bacteria from its water system in June by performing a superheated
flush. The hospital is awaiting lab results on whether a chlorine
flush last week was enough to get rid of the contamination.</TE>
<TE>   County officials say Good Samaritan properly reported the cases of
Legionnaires' to the county, but other hospitals may not be following
the law.</TE>

<HD>A Concerted Effort to Free Malibu Beaches for the Rest of
Us</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In case you've been wondering, mega-mogul David Geffen never did
return my call about using the beach at his spread in Malibu. I
promised I'd be in his front door and out on the sand in no time at
all, but he didn't even have the decency to call back.</LD>
<LD>   The beaches of California are legally owned by the public, as I
pointed out in January. But Geffen and other seaside
dwellers--including his DreamWorks SKG partners Steven Spielberg and
Jeffrey Katzenberg--have had a "Keep Out" sign up for years.</LD>
<LD>   And now Geffen, a man long associated with liberal causes, has
sued the state and the nonprofit group Access for All, trying to
block their efforts to open the beaches to the common man.</LD>
<TE>   "These Democrats are a bunch of hypocrites," said Access for All
President Steve Hoye. He noted that billionaire Democratic Party
fund-raisers Eli Broad and Haim Saban, neighbors of Geffen, tried to
keep their digs private by buying a nearby parcel for use as a sort
of Riffraff Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a class issue and it's about privilege," said Hoye. "It's
about these people with their money and their beach wanting to keep
it to themselves and keep out ordinary people."</TE>
<TE>   When I saw that Geffen and the city of Malibu had filed suit
together, making the same old misleading argument that the area can't
reasonably accommodate public use, I figured it was all over. Geffen
has enough money to keep this thing tied up in court until Adam
Sandler makes a movie I pay to see.</TE>
<TE>   But then, while perusing the geffen.com Web site, I got an idea.</TE>
<TE>   The bands on that site include Sheryl Crow, Sting and U2. And what
do those acts have in common?</TE>
<TE>   A social conscience.</TE>
<TE>   If the cause is to feed the hungry, fight injustice or save the
planet in the grand tradition of Live Aid or Farm Aid, you can
probably count on those artists to show up and sing their hearts out.</TE>
<TE>   So why not a concert to liberate the beaches of Malibu?</TE>
<TE>   Geffen sold the music portion of his empire, and he has nothing to
do with any of those bands. But he built his substantial fortune, in
part, on the backs of socially conscious crusaders like Peter
Gabriel, Jackson Browne and Joni Mitchell, who wrote the famous "Big
Yellow Taxi" lyric: "They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot."</TE>
<TE>   Well, guess what, Joni?</TE>
<TE>   They stole paradise, they put up a country club. It's high time we
got it back.</TE>
<TE>   My plan is to hold the event on the pier in the People's Republic
of Santa Monica, perhaps as early as August. Proceeds can go to the
legal defense fund of Access for All, the modest for-the-people
outfit that Geffen--a billionaire several times over--is attempting
to crush like a cockroach.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll definitely have to raise some dollars to defend ourselves,"
says Hoye, who suggested adding Don Henley to the concert bill.</TE>
<TE>   Not a bad idea. The former Eagle tried to save Walden Pond, so
there's a good chance he'll be interested in rescuing a public beach
from the clutches of these champagne-sipping pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Henley is also one of countless musicians who have tangled with
Geffen in bitter business feuds. Some of the details are in Tom
King's "The Operator," a book The Times called a "chronicle of greed
and misanthropy." Geffen had cat fights with Bob Dylan, Elton John,
Cher and Neil Young, among others.</TE>
<TE>   This is their chance to get back at him.</TE>
<TE>   I've already gotten word to representatives of Sting, Sheryl Crow,
U2, Peter Gabriel, Jackson Browne and Joni Mitchell, inviting them to
come together once more, for the people, in the name of equal
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, Geffen got permission to remodel his beach digs.</TE>
<TE>   Any idea how?</TE>
<TE>   He promised to create a walkway for public access to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   But when John Q. Public showed up with his family on a hot summer
day, Mr. Liberal Do-Gooder told him to get lost. And then, when he
feared he might not get his way, he did exactly what you'd expect a
guy like him to do.</TE>
<TE>   He sued.</TE>
<TE>   Where's Bono now? Isn't the U2 front man done saving Africa?</TE>
<TE>   It's time for Sting to put another message in a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   I'm going to call Los Lobos, too, and Ozomatli, a couple of L.A.
bands. The latter has an activism icon on its Web site with links to
11 causes, including Women in Prison, Revolutionary Worker and United
Farm Workers. How about making it a dozen?</TE>
<TE>   "We could call the concert Give Back Our Sand," said Hoye.</TE>
<TE>   Yes. But in the tradition of Live Aid and Farm Aid, we could also
go with Sand Aid. If anyone comes up with a better name, the prize is
a backstage pass. And I'll share producer credit with whoever writes
the best parody of "Big Yellow Taxi."</TE>
<TE>   Pardon us, Joni, but instead of "Hey, farmer, farmer, put away
that DDT," how about:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hey mogul, mogul, put away</TE>
<TE>   that lock and key.</TE>
<TE>   You stole the best beaches,</TE>
<TE>   Fenced them off from my friends</TE>
<TE>   and from me.</TE>
<TE>   Don't it always seem to go</TE>
<TE>   That you don't know what</TE>
<TE>   you've got till it's gone.</TE>
<TE>   They stole paradise.</TE>
<TE>   They put up a country club.</TE>

<HD>Invoking Magic Against Breakup</HD>
<DH>Politics: Former Laker star Earvin Johnson, though still
angry about Hahn's role in removal of former LAPD Chief Parks, joins
campaign against secession drives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earvin "Magic" Johnson, the basketball star whose business moves have
made him a significant civic figure in South Los Angeles, said
Tuesday he will play a major role in Mayor James K. Hahn's campaign
against secession movements in Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The involvement of the former Laker great is a coup for the
anti-secession effort and for the mayor, who angered Johnson and many
other African Americans when he opposed a second five-year term for
former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks this spring.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson said in an interview Tuesday that he remains bitter about
the mayor's handling of the chief's removal, but that African
Americans must separate that issue from secession.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got to understand that we can't let what Mayor Hahn did to
Chief Parks consume us so much that we can't think straight," Johnson
said. "This [secession] is a situation that will squarely affect
African Americans and Latinos.... If I sat here and held a grudge
against Mayor Hahn ... then I wouldn't be the man that I'm supposed
to be."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, who will join Johnson at a news conference today, said
Johnson will be a valuable asset to the campaign and that he welcomes
his involvement. Mayoral aides, who said Hahn met privately with
Johnson, said the mayor badly wanted Johnson to join the coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's great to have Earvin Johnson aboard because he's
someone who has demonstrated his commitment to Los Angeles," Hahn
said Tuesday. "He's willing to put his time and, more importantly,
his money into making this city better."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's charisma, coupled with his personal and professional
interest in South Los Angeles, make him a critical part of the
mayor's growing coalition against secession, political analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   His popularity transcends ethnic communities and his appeal
reaches across the city, said political consultant Harvey Englander.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson also could bring others into the group, possibly including
current Laker players. He also is involved in Parks' campaign for
City Council; Parks has not indicated his position on secession. But
Johnson said his backing of the anti-secession effort and the Parks
campaign are separate issues.</TE>
<TE>   The former basketball champion has built a solid business
enterprise in South Los Angeles with his Magic Johnson Theatres at
the Crenshaw Shopping Plaza and in other parts of the city and the
country. His latest venture is a $125-million apartment and shopping
complex at Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in Hollywood, and he has
opened a sports club in Sherman Oaks. His partnership with Starbucks
Corp. is a highly profitable venture, and he has concentrated those
in underserved parts of the city. He also purchased the Fatburger
chain last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Lombard, president of Johnson's development company, was
reelected Tuesday as president of the city Department of Water and
Power Commission. Lombard said Johnson does not want to see the city
split apart as he is trying to help move it forward.</TE>
<TE>   Voters across the city will be asked to decide Nov. 5 whether to
allow Hollywood and the Valley to create their own cities. If those
efforts are successful, Johnson said he believes the result would be
a city with fewer resources in minority neighborhoods. And he said he
does not believe the Valley could survive financially as an
independent city.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that his is a coveted endorsement, Johnson is seeking
some concessions in return for his willingness to join the mayor's
campaign. Johnson said Tuesday that he has asked Hahn to diversify
his staff by hiring more African Americans and Latinos in high
positions. Johnson said Hahn, who grew up in South Los Angeles, also
needs to do more to improve his communication with the black
community.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been on him," Johnson said. "If he had an African American
on his staff, they would have been able to tell him how we feel,
whether it's Chief Parks or Inglewood," where a white officer slammed
a black 16-year-old on the trunk of a patrol car and then punched him
in the face.</TE>
<TE>   "You need someone to understand the temperature of the African
American community, what their needs and wants are," Johnson said.
"You can't have a Caucasian telling him that, they're not in the
community."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn defended his record of hiring a diverse group of aides,
including blacks, Latinos, gays and lesbians, and Asians, among
others, from the time he was city controller to his 16 years as city
attorney, and now as mayor. Still, he said he is open to any
recommendations from Johnson or Lombard.</TE>
<TE>   With the secession vote approaching and some feelings still raw
over Hahn's handling of the Parks matter, Lombard said the mayor must
reach out to the African American community.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like family," Lombard said. "You've had a falling out; it's
our hope that the mayor is going to do all the work that he needs to
do to mend those relationships and get them back on track."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor is attempting to build a broad coalition of support for
his position against secession. Former Assemblyman and unsuccessful
mayoral candidate Antonio Villaraigosa, former Mayor Richard Riordan,
political consultant and advisor Bill Wardlaw and businessman Eli
Broad, among others, already are part of the team. Hahn's efforts
have been criticized by secession supporters, who say he is
assembling a group of civic power brokers to defend their own
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's initial efforts were criticized by some who believed he was
moving too slowly to address the threat of secession, but the mayor's
advisors say he is raising money and working to assemble the team.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Johnson said he and Lombard expect to be fully
involved in the strategy of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be involved 100%," Johnson said. "I want to educate
the people, especially minorities, about secession as well as to get
them to support my position."</TE>
<TE>   Whether his involvement signals a renewed friendship with Hahn
remains to be seen. Asked if he would support Hahn in 2005, Johnson
laughed and said that too is a separate issue.</TE>

<HD>A Power Struggle: Electric vs. Spiritual</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Indian tribes hope to block construction of a
geothermal plant they fear will drain healing force of Medicine Lake.</DH>

<DL>MEDICINE LAKE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Under a sky as wide as the world, Willard Rhoades comes to the lake
to heal himself.</LD>
<LD>   He wades into turquoise waters frigid with snowmelt, like
countless Native American ancestors before him. Tribal lore has it
that the Creator bathed in Medicine Lake, and it remains a place of
raw spiritual power to elders such as Rhoades, 83. A dunking, he
believes, washes away sickness of body and soul.</LD>
<LD>   Now a big energy company has come to tap a different kind of power
at Medicine Lake.</LD>
<TE>   Tempted by the geothermal energy that lurks beneath the volcanic
wild lands of California's far north, Calpine Corp. hopes to harvest
megawatts from generating plants only a few miles from the sacred
lake. Exploratory drilling is to begin this week.</TE>
<TE>   Tribal elders question whether the relatively meager energy to be
drawn from the Earth justifies wounding a ruggedly beautiful
landscape, a place of deep spiritual value to its first inhabitants:
the Pit River, Modoc, Shasta, Karuk and Wintun tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Calpine was sued by a coalition of tribes and
environmental groups. They rue the possibility of power lines and
exposed pipes snaking into the forest like the arms of an octopus.
They worry about tainted steam fouling unsullied air, the groan of
industry spoiling the quiet, electrical light pollution blemishing
night skies.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine officials say such concerns are unfounded. The
$120-million power plant will be clean and quiet, they insist, hidden
in the woods and free of but the barest traces of toxic emissions.
They will also bring a new generation of jobs to a land of
double-digit unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the company can't mitigate the dismay of Rhoades and other
Native Americans. For many, this corporate quest for geothermal power
is a 21st century echo of historic persecution by the white man.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same thing," said Rhoades. "This is a place of healing
and meditation, but instead there would be noise and pollution."</TE>
<TE>   The battle is playing out at a precarious time in the energy
business, amid ballooning cynicism over the authenticity of last
year's California crisis. But for San Jose-based Calpine, the
prospects for Medicine Lake are too tantalizing to scrap.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine's armada of new plants fired by natural gas remain
susceptible to the price swings of a fickle market for fossil fuels.
In contrast, power from a geothermal plant comes with no cost for
fuel--and produces 26 times less greenhouse gas. Mother Earth does
all the work: Deep pockets of subterranean water are superheated by
magma, producing steam to turn turbines.</TE>
<TE>   John Miller, Calpine's program manager, acknowledged that Native
Americans have had a long and important affiliation with Medicine
Lake. "We're very respectful of that," Miller said. But he said all
the land under lease is in national forests, not a tribal
reservation. The company's first venture--a 49-megawatt plant--is set
for a spot known as Fourmile Hill. Several more geothermal plants
could follow. The company recently won a legal battle forcing federal
officials to reconsider rejection two years ago of a second plant
even closer to the lake. In all, Calpine holds geothermal leases on
66 square miles of Medicine Lake Highlands.</TE>
<TE>   This is a land of geological mystique. The lake is in a
six-mile-long crater, the caldera of North America's broadest
volcano. Upon that flat backside, the Earth has belched mountains of
glistening obsidian and fields of chalky pumice. Lava caves and
cinder cones dot the terrain. Native Americans of the area say they
have used Medicine Lake as a sanctuary since the Creator descended
from nearby Mt. Shasta. It was a place for coming-of-age ceremonies
and vision quests. Tribes from all over came to gather obsidian,
chipping the shiny black stone into razor-sharp hatchets and spears.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1850s, Gold Rush settlers overran these ancestral lands.
History tells of a lopsided fight.</TE>
<TE>   Famine and disease spread. State legislators authorized $1.5
million to suppress the natives, giving rise to bounty hunters. Many
Indians were killed or enslaved. California historian Hubert Howe
Bancroft called it "one of the last human hunts of civilization, and
the basest and most brutal of them all."</TE>
<TE>   The most notorious standoff came in 1872, when a Modoc leader
named Intpuash--dubbed Captain Jack by tongue-tied settlers--holed up
with more than 50 warriors in caverns north of Medicine Lake. Badly
outnumbered, they held off the cavalry for a year before Captain Jack
was captured and hanged.</TE>
<TE>   During the century that followed, the region's tribes demonstrated
a consistent devotion to their ancestral lands. In the turbulent
early 1970s, scores of Pit River tribal members were arrested trying
to claim land held by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and the U.S. Forest
Service.</TE>
<TE>   That effort failed, but today the Pit River--with more than 2,000
members--remain a tribe unafraid to take on powerful forces. Out of
their base in the mountain town of Burney, they have led the fight
over Medicine Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very sacred place," said Vern Johnson, a Pit River member
and executive director of the California Council of Tribal
Governments. "Young people have threatened to lay down in front of
the heavy equipment if it comes to that."</TE>
<TE>   A power plant at Medicine Lake would be as inappropriate as a
McDonald's, said John Mike, 43, another Pit. "It would probably take
the spirit out of that place."</TE>
<TE>   Regulators don't necessarily disagree.</TE>
<TE>   An environmental report concludes that the plant's effects on air,
water and wildlife are negligible, but it says Native American values
could be undermined. And there's no way to fix it. Plumes of steam
and noise could interrupt vision quests, the report says, and the
siphoning of geothermal waters "may adversely affect the spiritual
qualities of Medicine Lake."</TE>
<TE>   "It would be like a Catholic going to confession and someone
opening the door," said Jerald Jackson, a Modoc elder.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson says he needs the lake now more than ever. For the past
year, cancer has been eating away his bone marrow. He's receiving
medical treatment near his home in Klamath Falls, Ore., but believes
Medicine Lake has "kept me alive so far."</TE>
<TE>   But a few Native Americans of the north state find it hard not to
doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "That healing power and all that is baloney; that went out in the
1900s," said Erin Forrest, longtime leader of the Hewitt band, one of
11 branches that make up the Pit River Tribe.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest, who supports Calpine, contends the Pit River hierarchy is
holding out for big royalty money from the energy firm. Pit River
elders discount such claims as sour grapes from a loser in tribal
political wars.</TE>
<TE>   An even nastier rift has erupted within the Shasta Nation. The
tribe has split in two, with one band backing Calpine, the other
opposed.</TE>
<TE>   To entice support, Calpine has dangled the prospect of college
scholarships and jobs if the project comes online. It has already
provided legal services and an ethnographer, Shasta leaders say, to
help with the tribe's slogging 20-year effort to gain federal
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Offering help to a local community is standard practice to spur
support for a large industrial project, said Joe Ronan, Calpine's
government and regulatory chief. "It's just," he said, "how this
stuff works."</TE>
<TE>   What won over Betty Hall, a Shasta elder who supports Calpine, was
coming to terms with 21st century reality. Today, the shores of
Medicine Lake are scattered with dozens of cabins and three
campgrounds. On summer afternoons, it roars with power boats and
personal watercraft. "The truth is," Hall said, "the damage is
already done."</TE>
<TE>   Rob and Janie Painter, who own a vacation cabin on the lake, don't
dispute that recreational users leave footprints, but they say it
doesn't compare to a power plant's stomp on the landscape. "It's
being pushed down a lot of people's throats," Janie Painter said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials aren't about to step in the way. The
only hope of stopping the Fourmile Hill project is in the courts,
opponents say.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a second geothermal plant, which was rejected by
federal officials in 2000, is suddenly back on the table. Under an
agreement to settle a legal case brought by Calpine, Washington must
by November reconsider allowing a facility at Telephone Flat, about a
mile from the lake.</TE>
<TE>   If it isn't approved, Calpine can take the dispute back to court
to seek the $100 million in damages it has claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Such threats have federal officials feeling boxed in. Sean
Hagerty, a Bureau of Land Management geothermal expert, said the Bush
administration "doesn't want to pay a company to not produce power in
a state that needs power."</TE>
<TE>   Calpine has already sealed a deal with the Bonneville Power
Administration in Portland, Ore., to buy geothermal energy from
Medicine Lake, and it has won approval for $49 million in state
subsidies to be slowly meted out once the plants begin generating
electricity. The state is providing an additional $1 million for
exploratory drilling.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents cast this arrangement as a bitter irony: power
subsidized by California taxpayers being exported out of state.
Calpine's Miller countered that Bonneville sells energy to California
utilities all the time. As for the prospect of state subsidies, he
said it has helped keep the company on course as costs jumped with
legal and regulatory delays.</TE>
<TE>   In time, Miller added, all concerned will "learn to live with what
we're bringing to the area."</TE>
<TE>   Such talk rankles the Modoc tribe's Jackson, a quiet man of
peaceful intent.</TE>
<TE>   This month, he will be back up to the highlands for a ceremony at
the stronghold of Captain Jack. Drums will play atop the lava beds.
Political talk, normally avoided at such events, may be unavoidable.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few miles up the rise, Calpine will be boring into Mother
Earth, trying to tap her essence.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings back old anger from what happened years ago," Jackson
said. "Resentment and anger. We try to tell our young people, don't
feel that way. It ain't going to help. But now we can't help but feel
that way too."</TE>

<HD>Political Gold Medal: Davis Tops $50 Million</HD>
<DH>Politics: The record for fund-raising in a U.S.
gubernatorial race is eclipsed with months to go. Simon trails badly
in the money race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has now raised more than $50 million for his bid to
capture a second term as chief executive of the nation's most
populous state, an amount greater than any other candidate for
governor in American history.</LD>
<LD>   The Davis campaign's decision to release his semiannual campaign
finance report Tuesday--more than two weeks before the filing
deadline--increased the pressure on Republican rival Bill Simon Jr.,
whose fund-raising has lagged far behind that of the Democratic
incumbent.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' prodigious fund-raising left his campaign with $31.6
million in the bank at the end of June. The latest report shows Davis
collected $13.9 million during the first six months of this year.</LD>
<TE>   His campaign spent $18.7 million in the same period, much of it on
television ads that lashed former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan
and helped propel Simon to victory in the hard-fought Republican
primary last March. Once Simon captured the GOP nomination, Davis
sought to define Simon in a new barrage of negative TV ads.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law there are no limits to what an individual, a
business or a labor union can contribute to a candidate for governor.
As a consequence, it is not unusual for Davis to collect checks of
$50,000 or more. With no limits, Davis has been able to shatter all
records for candidates for governor nationwide, easily eclipsing
President Bush when he was governor of Texas and New York Gov. George
Pataki.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1998 campaign, Bush raised about $25 million, while Pataki
raised slightly less the same year.</TE>
<TE>   The record Davis broke was his own, according to Ed Bender,
research director of the Montana-based National Institute on Money
and State Politics: He raised $35 million in his first campaign for
governor four years ago. He began building up the $50 million when he
took office in January 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's historic fund-raising pace has given him the
financial wherewithal to buy vast amounts of television advertising,
but it has also raised questions about the propriety of collecting
large sums from individuals and companies with business before state
government.</TE>
<TE>   Without any additional income, Davis now has enough money to buy
$1.5 million of television time every week until the November
election--an amount necessary to influence busy voters--and still
have money left over.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign coffers are not in the same robust condition.
Campaign consultant Sal Russo would not say exactly how much the GOP
contender had on hand at the end of June, although another source
indicated it was about $5 million. Nor would he discuss how much the
candidate has raised, other than to say Simon is ahead of the
fund-raising pace set four years ago when Republican Dan Lungren ran
for governor. The former attorney general lost in a landslide to
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   By another measure--a Times analysis of reports of large
contributions, which must be independently reported by the
campaigns--Davis has outraised Simon since the two rivals filed
campaign finance statements in mid-February.</TE>
<TE>   Although he expects to be outspent by Davis, Russo expressed
confidence that Simon will have the money necessary to get his
message out to California voters.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign received its biggest financial boost in April
when President Bush hosted fund-raising events for the Republican
candidate in Los Angeles and the Bay Area that raised almost $5
million.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is planning to headline three more fund-raising events for
Simon before Labor Day, Russo said. Vice President Dick Cheney will
also host an event.</TE>
<TE>   Russo acknowledged that Davis has raised money quite successfully.
But he said Davis at the same time has ignored problems facing the
state. The Simon campaign repeatedly has sought to use Davis'
fund-raising to question the integrity of his administration and
actions while in office.</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest contributors to the Davis campaign is the
California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., which represents the
state's prison guards.</TE>
<TE>   The union gave the governor $251,000 shortly after the governor
agreed to a significant pay raise for prison guards--despite the
state's budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the other large contributors to the governor have been
labor unions representing government employees, operating engineers,
laborers, electrical workers, and the construction and pipefitter
trades.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' largest individual contributors include Hollywood producer
Stephen L. Bing and Silicon Valley executive Reed Hastings. Casden
Properties, a Los Angeles developer, gave the governor $105,000.
Billionaire businessman Eli Broad, chairman of SunAmerica,
contributed $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about his penchant for fund-raising, Davis has
explained that he is not wealthy and had to engage in intense
fund-raising in case he faced a rich opponent with deep pockets--like
Simon or Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Davis won the Democratic primary in 1998 after fighting wealthy
rivals Al Checchi and Jane Harman, both of whom contributed heavily
to their own campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Bender, of the National Institute on Money in State Politics, said
California campaigns differ markedly from most states in the union.</TE>
<TE>   "California is basically a country within this country," he said.
"It has a huge population, huge media markets and is a very expensive
place to live."</TE>

<HD>Tension Over Court's Pledge Ruling Defused</HD>
<DH>Conference: The controversial decision livens up annual
gathering of 9th Circuit Court judges, who also discuss civil
liberties in changed world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>It was 6 p.m. at the opening session of the 9th Circuit's annual
judicial conference, and all eyes were on the stage, where a
naturalization ceremony had just taken place.</LD>
<LD>   "For many of us, it's traditional to recite the Pledge of
Allegiance" following such a ceremony, said the emcee, federal trial
judge Michael R. Hogan, prompting chuckles.</LD>
<LD>   As the crowd uttered the familiar words Monday evening, there was
no diminution in volume during the clause "under God."</LD>
<TE>   Among those taking part was Judge Alfred T. Goodwin, dressed in a
blue polo shirt and black cowboy boots.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a schoolhouse, you can say anything you want," he
quipped to a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the Pledge of Allegiance is hardly a laughing matter
for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. On June 26, a sharply
divided panel headed by Goodwin ruled 2 to 1 that compelling students
to recite the words "under God" is an unconstitutional endorsement of
religion. The decision, which has been put on hold pending an appeal,
precipitated a firestorm of criticism nationwide, including sharp
words from President Bush and a 99-0 vote of condemnation by the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the controversy, which has included pickets outside his
second home in Pasadena, Goodwin seems unruffled. "I've had a great
life as a judge, including the last three weeks," the Nixon appointee
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the pledge debate is clearly an undercurrent at the
annual conference, the gathering at the plush Loews Coronado Bay
Hotel does not have the air of a siege.</TE>
<TE>   Just last Friday, Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska), a longtime
critic of the appeals court, introduced legislation that would split
the nine-state circuit--the nation's largest--into two. But several
members of the court, including former chief judge Procter Hug Jr.,
say they are confident that won't happen.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one frequent topic of conversation has been the fact that
the 9th Circuit does not have enough judges. Chief Judge Mary M.
Schroeder, in her keynote address, lamented the fact that there are
five vacancies on the 28-judge court. Nonetheless, she declared, "The
state of the circuit remains excellent."</TE>
<TE>   The pledge has hardly been the only topic of conversation at the
conference, where participants have been schmoozing with compatriots
between panels on such weighty topics as civil liberties in an age of
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, former U.S. Secretary of State Warren M.
Christopher and former FBI and CIA director William H. Webster
appeared at a session entitled "These Uncertain Times: An Interactive
Panel on National Security and Civil Liberties in the Wake of the
9/11/2001 Terrorist Attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Christopher, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, expressed
dismay that the federal government has kept secret the identity of
hundreds of individuals detained in connection with investigations of
terrorism. "I remember going to Argentina and mothers protesting in
the streets asking the government where it was holding people, those
who had disappeared," Christopher said. "We must be very careful in
this country about taking people in custody without revealing their
names."</TE>
<TE>   He said the names should be made public so relatives will know
where they are and can seek legal assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, a Republican appointee, expressed reservations about
President Bush's creation of military tribunals that could try
terrorism suspects in secret. Webster said it might be appropriate to
have such trials when someone was captured in a foreign country, but
not in the U.S. "We still have a good [judicial] system," Webster
said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Atty. Gen. Viet Dinh, who heads the Justice Department's
Office of Legal Policy, countered that the administration is
following proper legal principles and that all detainees have been
given the opportunity to speak to family members or an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   At another panel on civil liberties during earlier crises, 9th
Circuit Judge A. Wallace Tashima and Los Angeles Police Commission
member Rose Marie Ouchi described the wrenching personal experiences
they and their families experienced when they were uprooted from
their Los Angeles homes and taken to internment camps after Japan
attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941.</TE>
<TE>   The civil liberties debate and the undercurrent of the pledge
brouhaha have made the normally staid conference a rather lively
affair.</TE>
<TE>   The closely watched naturalization ceremony was planned long
before the ruling in the pledge case. Hogan, an affable 55-year-old
jurist from Eugene, Ore., proposed the ceremony a year ago after
conference planners decided that immigration issues should be among
those featured at the gathering near the U.S.-Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those gathered, including one of the conference's special
guests, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, held small U.S.
flags that were distributed as they entered the ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   The mood was festive but with an air of anticipation. What would
Hogan say after the crowd loudly applauded the 26 new
Americans--whose native countries range from Iran to Luxembourg--who
had solemnly sworn that they would "bear true faith and allegiance"
to their new homeland?</TE>
<TE>   Hogan, who was appointed by President Bush's father in 1991, had a
delicate task--introducing the pledge without aggravating the
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   As a Marine Corps band stood at attention, Hogan said that he
respected all the judges of the 9th Circuit, even when they were at
odds. "One of the things that's great about our country is that we
can disagree and still respect one another," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then he told the several hundred people in the crowd that it was
up to each of them to choose just how to say the pledge. "We need to
decide for ourselves what words are appropriate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd rose collectively. It was over in a matter of seconds.
Then, after a stirring rendition of "America the Beautiful" by a San
Diego lawyer, the audience adjourned for cocktails and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan was congratulated by many for deftly handling his
potentially awkward task. Outside the ballroom, he chatted briefly
with Goodwin, a fellow Oregonian whom he described as "a good
friend."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Goodwin, 78, said he was somewhat surprised at how
vociferous the reaction to the pledge decision has been. He
attributed some of the outrage to the changed climate after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "There's anxiety. There's fear. And it's an even-numbered year,"
he said, referring to the fact that there will be congressional
elections in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   After listening attentively to the civil liberties panel Tuesday
morning, Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who joined Goodwin's opinion and is
the most outspoken liberal on the court, said he was taken aback by
the gravity of the reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of any other decision where Congress immediately
condemned a court decision," Reinhardt said.</TE>
<TE>   The dissenting judge on the pledge panel, Ferdinand Fernandez, is
not attending the conference, court officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Goodwin nor Reinhardt is making any predictions about what
will happen next in the case. The Elk Grove School Board has said it
will ask for a rehearing, and the Justice Department has indicated
that it will file a friend-of-the-court brief urging reversal. There
is a widespread feeling here, expressed by, among others, ACLU
national president Nadine Strossen, that the decision will be
overturned.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there is a possibility that the case could fade away
without a further ruling. Last week, the mother of the schoolgirl who
is at the center of the suit hired her own lawyers to inform the
public that she and her daughter are Christians who do not agree with
the decision. The girl's father, Michael Newdow, who filed the suit
on her behalf, is an atheist and is not married to the mother.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said it was possible that if a court decides that
the mother is the true representative of the girl and wants to drop
the case, it could be made moot. However, that involves complex legal
questions that may not be resolved for months.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Goodwin has drawn a lot of questions about the
case at the conference. Until the matter came before him, he said, he
had not given a great deal of thought to the pledge, which was
changed to include the words "under God" in 1954, one year before he
was first appointed to a state court judgeship in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin said he has presided over many naturalization ceremonies
and, "Usually I ask one of the new citizens to lead the pledge
because they have been memorizing it. To me [the added words "under
God"] were kind of a blip in the poetry of the pledge."</TE>

<LD>A former broker for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in Newport Beach agreed
Tuesday to repay $337,372 he allegedly stole from clients, plus
$43,696 in interest and a $337,372 fine, to settle a lawsuit filed by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Gregory A. Hinkson, 38, of Irvine did not admit or deny the
charges in the civil action, filed in federal court in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators had accused Hinkson of transferring funds without
authorization from clients' money-market accounts and making
unauthorized trades to receive $10,016 in commissions, as well as
telling clients who noticed that Merrill had made a mistake and would
replace the missing funds.</LD>

<HD>Tourists in Big Bear Suggest a Few Ways to Improve on
Mother Nature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Tourists in Catalina aren't the only ones asking stupid questions,"
begins a note from Kay Yates of Big Bear Lake, referring to an item
in this column. As proof she enclosed a clipping from the Big Bear
Shopper that listed some of the suggestions and comments that the
U.S. Forest Service has received, including:</LD>
<LD>   * "Please avoid building trails that go uphill."</LD>
<LD>   * "Reflectors need to be placed on trees every 50 feet so people
can hike at night with flashlights."</LD>
<TE>   * "Trails need to be wider so people can walk holding hands."</TE>
<TE>   * "Need more signs to keep area pristine."</TE>
<TE>   * "Too many rocks in the mountains."</TE>
<TE>   And, finally:</TE>
<TE>   * "A dear [stet] came into my camp and stole my bag of pickles. Is
there a way I can get reimbursed?"</TE>
<TE>   But can it navigate the freeways? Kevin McDaniels of Santa Barbara
was surprised to come upon a 4-wheeled watercraft (see accompanying).
I wonder what kind of cruise control it has.</TE>
<TE>   You know how picky relatives can be: Mark Berlin of Venice saw an
opening for a chef who specializes in family-style dining (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of family gatherings: All your cousins and aunts and
uncles could fit on the piece of furniture spotted by Lorraine Curtis
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   A singular distinction: Did you hear that Marina del Rey has the
second-highest percentage of divorced folks of any community in the
nation? Cape Canaveral, with its history of wild-living astronauts,
is first with 22%. Marina del Rey's rate is 20.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post called the Marina a "hangout that gives off a
'70s swinger musk as memorable as a whiff of Brut cologne" and quoted
a dating consultant as warning, "If you go to the Marina, you're
going to be hit on by a bunch of rug heads" (toupeed gents). I don't
care what they say. I still get teary-eyed when I hear George
Strait's tender country ballad about the couple whose romance went
bad after they had " ... loved the world away / in Marina del Rey."</TE>
<TE>   Think of it as a going-away party: The note about the San Fernando
Valley Independence Committee asking that donations be sent to a West
L.A. address caught the eye of Kathy Prickett, way back in Carthage,
N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminded me of a story about a man who planned to build a
brick wall around the state of Texas," she said. "Of course,
three-quarters of the donations were from out of state."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: It seems as though almost every weird story has a
Southern California connection. Baseball star Ted Williams (born in
San Diego) dies, and his son has his body frozen by a company called
Alcor Life Extension Foundation (founded in Riverside).</TE>
<TE>   Next, Alcor will be holding a convention Nov. 16-17 at the Newport
Beach Marriott. No word on whether Williams will be there, in body or
in spirit.</TE>

<HD>1,500 Wins, No Losses Worth Crying Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was seven guys sitting around a restaurant table, talking about
each other, reliving the good times and laughing their heads off. I
didn't know any of them, but after an hour, I envied them all.</LD>
<LD>   They have something I want; something all of us probably want. The
reason there's so much uproarious laughter on my tape recorder is
because they know they've got something special.</LD>
<LD>   The guys are a team, a bunch of good-time Charlies in their 40s
and 50s who play softball twice a week. Lots of men and women in
Orange County do that, but not as well and not nearly as long.</LD>
<TE>   Around the table are three charter members of a team called Stac
Pac that began playing in January 1988 and is still going strong. The
others joined not long after.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, thanks to the meticulous record-keeping of charter
member and manager Bob Baumgarten, the club celebrated its 1,500th
win. By Baumgarten's count, it has won nine "major" championships.
"The most games we ever played in a year was 1992, when we played
181," Baumgarten says. "We were 132-49. We won five of the six
leagues we played in and six tournaments."</TE>
<TE>   The weird thing is, to hear the guys tell it, it's not about
winning. They swear they aren't a team of psycho jocks to whom
winning is everything. Once, they walked off the field when the other
team wanted to rumble. "There are a lot of jerks in softball," says
ranking elder Mike Galli, 57. By contrast, "these guys have pretty
minimal egos."</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone into a lot of tournaments when we were not the best
team out there," says Dan Wiercioch, 43. "But we were the best team
out there."</TE>
<TE>   Their 1,500th win (they've lost 651) was merely my excuse to meet
them. I envy the bond that develops on a team that plays together for
14 1/2 years. And, as a guy who used to play three times a week in
three leagues, I wanted to hear the stories start flying....</TE>
<TE>   "Worst collision we've ever seen," one of them starts out.</TE>
<TE>   Instantly, different guys start telling the story as one. "Mike
[Galli] and another Mike.... They collided in a qualifying tournament
in Torrance.... Had to be April of '91.... The other Mike was huge,
about 250 pounds, and we always said if those two ever collided, Mike
Galli would get killed.... They collide head-to-head on a fly
ball.... The other Mike broke bones on the side of his face.... But
Galli is knocked out cold, lying on the ground snorting like a
horse...."</TE>
<TE>   By now, big laughs are reverberating from the table, as the punch
line comes: "He caught the ball, though!"</TE>
<TE>   I ask them to get serious, which proves harder than turning a
triple play. Dave LeFort, 45, tries. "Everybody has to have a release
from work, from life, and all that," he says. "When you hit that
softball field, you can get everything out. It's the guys; it's
having a good time.... I wouldn't want to do it with anyone else than
with the teams we've put together."</TE>
<TE>   Al Shelley, 45, chips in: "It's the perfect blend, to me, of doing
something you love with guys you love, and their families."</TE>
<TE>   It's about them remembering when Al brought a girlfriend named
Nanci to her first softball game. They're now married with five
children. It's joking about another of the players' daughters whom
they first knew as a little girl and who's now old enough to order a
beer.</TE>
<TE>   It's about another former player who played the day his wife gave
birth to their first child. "I didn't even have him in the lineup,"
Baumgarten says, "and he was the first guy to show up at the field."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, it was only a birth. That was the team.</TE>
<TE>   Lest you think this is a bunch of Peter Pans, they go around the
table and recite lengths of their marriages or long-term
relationships: 12, 24, 18, 17, 25.</TE>
<TE>   At the risk of being ejected from the room, I ask: Is the end in
sight?</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to think about it," one of them says.</TE>
<TE>   Denial?</TE>
<TE>   "What do you mean, denial? Of course, it's denial," says Galli, a
two-time grandfather, longtime Stac Pac leadoff man and, according to
Baumgarten, possessor of more than 4,500 hits.</TE>
<TE>   In a more somber moment, Galli, who has a sore shoulder, says, "It
has to end. It can't go on forever."</TE>
<TE>   And then comes a bunch of jokes about Dr. Kevorkian and Viagra,
and I leave the guys as I found them, laughing and chiding each
other.</TE>
<TE>   And very much aware of good fortune that comes in ways more
important than wins and losses.</TE>

<LD>Give us a little credit, won't you?</LD>
<LD>   Isn't it possible we've learned something in 11 years?</LD>
<LD>   I speak of the Donovan Jackson matter in Inglewood, the videotaped
incident of a 16-year-old black kid in handcuffs being slammed down
on a police car and punched by a white police officer.</LD>
<TE>   It has been accompanied by protests and demonstrations, the deja
vu street lullaby of "No justice, no peace."</TE>
<TE>   But what a difference a decade makes. This disgraceful video
moment has generated maybe half a dozen investigations, a scramble to
be first in line with the subpoenas. Does anybody in public life
really want to be on the wrong side of this one?</TE>
<TE>   Donovan Jackson was 5 years old in the spring of 1991, when in the
space of two appalling weeks, we saw first the video of Rodney King
being beaten and then the video of 15-year-old Latasha Harlins being
shot in the back of the head by a shopkeeper after a tussle over a
$1.79 bottle of orange juice.</TE>
<TE>   A year later we saw the acquittals of the four Rodney King cops.
And then we saw the rioting that razed hopes and jobs, livelihoods
and lives. It changed this city, its people, and, one begins to hope,
its Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, Ron Banks wore LAPD blue. He joined the year after
the Watts riots, and got the full ration of grief from white cops who
thought a black man in uniform was part of the problem, not part of
the solution. In 1992, he was one of the first LAPD brass to show up
at Florence and Normandie. Now he's the police chief of Inglewood.
Don't you think he remembers?</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, Roosevelt Dorn was a Superior Court judge, a black
man about to preside over the trial of the three black men charged
with beating trucker Reginald Denny nearly to death at that same
intersection. Prosecutors yanked him off the case. Now he's the mayor
of Inglewood. Don't you think he remembers?</TE>
<TE>   Yet some people are acting as if the Rodney King incident and its
Richter-scale consequences never happened.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First, about those expired license plate tags on Jackson's
father's car, a middle-aged tan Ford Taurus, the reason sheriff's
deputies say they questioned him in the first place. Expired tags--
yeah, wasn't that how they nabbed Capone? Don't today's cops have
computers in their cars, so they can check on the spot on a possibly
hot car?</TE>
<TE>   Second, you don't hit someone who's already in handcuffs. Bernie
Parks, the recently departed L.A. police chief and now candidate for
Los Angeles City Council, spoke last week at a dinner honoring
Roosevelt Dorn, and he talked about that video: Once you handcuff
someone and have him in that position, a blow is not
necessary--that's bad police work, plain and simple.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood is not the same city it was a quarter-century or so ago,
when its population was turning black but its council was white, and
the new City Hall had a deliberately small council chamber to keep
down crowd size. But Inglewood is in for some of the same rough
navel-gazing that L.A. did a decade ago, over issues of police and
power, as it should be. There is always reason to wonder whether any
establishment, black or white, can rap its own knuckles.</TE>
<TE>   But along with the sincere anguish over this incident is what
looks like insincere grandstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "New York Al," the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been front and center
in this, blew into town with advance notice of his flight number and
arrival time. He's a big noise in the Big Apple, and there are
mutterings about him running for president, but in all these years he
still hasn't been able to make his bones in L.A. Maybe he figures
this can do it for him.</TE>
<TE>   And over in the right corner, President Bush, who is running for
president, sent his attorney general swooping in to deal with this
problem in a black city the same week Bush was being flayed by the
NAACP over his civil rights policy.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Cannon, whose book "Official Negligence" analyzes, as its
subtitle says, "How Rodney King and the Riots Changed Los Angeles and
the LAPD," finds similarities, in that the images of both the King
and Jackson beatings are videotaped moments out of large episodes, "a
partial record of a partial record."</TE>
<TE>   But King, says Cannon, was not under police control when the
whacking began, 56 video blows in all. Donovan Jackson was, and
"there's a bright line between what you do when someone is handcuffed
and when he isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, says Cannon, "I don't see any evidence of anybody
saying, 'We're not gonna prosecute this guy [Morse].' I guess the
rhetorical question is: What breakdown of the justice system has
occurred that we need help?"</TE>
<TE>   Kerman Maddox is an African American, an L.A. native, a political
consultant and a friend, and I asked him for his take on the Sharpton
role in the protests that have thronged Inglewood's official places.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no need for a guy like Al Sharpton to come in; he creates
a misinformation campaign, giving the impression that nothing is
being done. Things are happening; this is not Rodney King 1991.
Everybody's doing what I think they ought to do in a responsible and
swift manner. Al is giving the impression he's doing what no one else
in this town could have done, and that drives me crazy."</TE>
<TE>   "Some people want this to be Rodney King," he added. "It's not
Rodney King. The city's different. And we've all learned."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Archdiocese Hit With Class-Action Suit</HD>
<DH>Abuse: Two Ventura County men are named as plaintiffs. If
certified, it would allow dozens of others to join litigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what one lawyer described as "a way to hasten the healing," three
attorneys Tuesday filed a class-action lawsuit against the Roman
Catholic Church's Los Angeles Archdiocese on behalf of known and
unidentified victims of clergy sexual abuse.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, is the first known
class action to be filed against the church in Southern California's
molestation scandal, which has seen more than 60 current and former
priests come under investigation by law enforcement agencies this
year.</LD>
<LD>   The suit names two Ventura County men as plaintiffs and alleges
childhood sexual abuse, sexual battery and negligence by one unnamed
priest. The archdiocese, the suit alleges, failed to ensure the
safety of children and prevent future acts of molestation while
engaging in a pattern of concealment.</LD>
<TE>   The attorneys said the class action, if certified by a judge,
would allow dozens of others alleging sexual abuse by a variety of
priests to join the litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We could continue to file individual cases on behalf of
victims--a long, drawn-out process," said Raymond Boucher, a Beverly
Hills attorney and one of the three filing the suit. "Or we could
pursue the class-action approach that provides the greatest
possibility for victims to resolve their claims."</TE>
<TE>   Clients could obtain out-of-court settlements or court verdicts
"with as little pain as possible" because a class-action suit
involves less rigorous examinations of individual cases and puts more
emphasis on a pattern of conduct, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher said he and attorneys Larry Drivon of Stockton and Jeffrey
Anderson of St. Paul, Minn., have more than 50 clients who allege
sexual abuse by one-time archdiocese priests.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's lawsuit was filed on behalf of two men identified as
Manny V. and Tranquilano G.</TE>
<TE>   Although the suit did not name a specific priest, the lawyers said
Tuesday that the two men were sexually abused as minors by Father
Fidencio Silva while he was pastor at Oxnard's Our Lady of Guadalupe
parish during the late 1970s and early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Silva, 45, who was named in a previous lawsuit by eight Ventura
County men, is the subject of an Oxnard police investigation. Silva,
who now serves as a priest with the Missionaries of the Holy Spirit
in Mexico, has denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese, anticipating the lawsuit, released a statement
Monday saying it wants to resolve as many cases as possible in the
shortest amount of time and emphasizing actions taken in the past by
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony to limit the possibility of priestly abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important for the victims, their families and the church to
expedite this process and move toward a brighter future," said Tod
Tamberg, an archdiocese spokesman. The archdiocese has a
zero-tolerance policy for abusers and no priest accused of
molestation is in active ministry, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Mahony directed the removal of seven priests from the
ministry earlier this year, dozens of victims have made additional
allegations against clerics, triggering law enforcement
investigations of more than five dozen current and former priests.
The nation's largest archdiocese covers 287 parishes in Los Angeles,
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit comes days after Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation
that creates a 12-month window in 2003 permitting the filing of cases
involving sexual abuse, regardless of when incident occurred. Tamberg
said the law is unfair and "plainly focused against the Catholic
Church." He added that the passage of time makes decades-old
allegations hard to disprove.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Drivon said the new law allows victims to seek justice
and holds the church hierarchy responsible. "They are the ones who
covered up criminal conduct for decades," he said. "They cannot
scream now [because] they have to answer."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, archbishop since 1985, early this year adopted a
zero-tolerance policy for cases of past, present and future abuse.
That policy, church officials say, went further than a policy Mahony
adopted in 1992, which established a zero-tolerance policy for new
allegations of abuse, but did not oust some clerics with prior
allegations who had received psychological treatment.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the U.S. Conference of Bishops in Dallas adopting a
zero-tolerance policy for clergy abuse nationwide in June, Mahony
last month asked "for forgiveness" from Southern California Catholics
"for not understanding earlier the extent of the problem" or acting
sooner to remove priests who abused minors. He also beefed up an
existing clergy misconduct board.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, however, has come under fire for his transfer of Father
Michael Stephen Baker to several parishes after the priest told him
in 1986 that he had molested young boys. Mahony later approved a
$1.3-million settlement with two men who had allegedly been abused by
Baker in the 1990s and forcibly laicized him. Archdiocese officials
say that Baker already knew those victims and that the cardinal has
never transferred a known molester into a parish where they found a
new victim.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors convinced a grand jury to subpoena church documents
related to Baker and two other priests, but have yet to complete the
process of obtaining them.</TE>

<HD>4 to Run for Council as a Slow-Growth Slate</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: They vow to limit campaign spending and not
take money from developers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An ousted planning commissioner and three fellow slow-growth
advocates announced plans Tuesday to campaign jointly to win seats on
the Thousand Oaks City Council in November.</LD>
<LD>   Former commissioner Michael Farris, marketing manager for a
Camarillo high tech company; Laura Lee Custodio, a lawyer and
teacher; and restaurateur Bill Wilson Sr. gathered at City Hall to
collect nomination papers for the coming election. Planning
Commission President Claudia Bill-de la Pena said she has an
appointment to collect her paperwork today.</LD>
<LD>   This is the first week that candidates can begin to gather the 20
signatures needed to place their names on the ballot. So far,
incumbents Dan Del Campo, Andy Fox and Dennis Gillette are seeking
reelection to four-year terms.</LD>
<TE>   The other open seat is being vacated by Linda Parks, who recently
was elected to the county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commissioner Randy Hoffman, who lost a bid for the Board
of Supervisors in March, is also running for council, as is Donald H.
Morris, a retired engineering consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we have a strong team that can represent the residents
of this city," said Farris, 33, who has a doctorate in space physics
from UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the grass-roots effort are being worked out, he said,
but the slow-growth council hopefuls would refuse campaign donations
from developers, adhere to a voluntary $250 contribution limit and a
$25,000 spending limit, fight to preserve the city's quality of life
and favor the rights of homeowners over those of special interests.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here on behalf of the slow-growth movement and we have
unfinished business," said Custodio, 50, who ran with Del Campo for
City Council in 1998 but now wants his seat. "It's time to give
government back to the people."</TE>
<TE>   She said every council candidate will likely support managed
growth, but that only this team is endorsed by Parks and Mayor Ed
Masry, who both won two years ago on a slow-growth platform.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, who owns Cisco's Mexican restaurant in Westlake, said
Parks asked him to campaign to serve out the remaining two years of
her term. Parks beat Hoffman for the Board of Supervisors seat, which
she will assume in January.</TE>
<TE>   Bill-de la Pena, a producer for KCBS-TV, said she wants to further
push initiatives she has supported during her 18 months on the
Planning Commission, such as adding an air-quality element to the
city's general plan, requiring builders to use less toxic materials
and environmentally friendly construction methods, and forcing
developers of affordable housing units to keep prices or rents lower
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Farris was one of two planning commissioners removed in February
amid accusations of violating the state's open-meeting laws by
conferring with Parks to postpone a vote on a land-swap plan to
prevent development of 191 acres known as the Western Plateau. Parks'
critics suggested she wanted a delay to avoid having to vote on the
issue before the March election.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for giving the land to the city, three developers were
permitted to build more expensive condos and apartments rather than
225 senior and affordable units in the Dos Vientos area.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern for Farris, then commission chairman, and
Commissioner Nora Aidukas, was a plan to build three luxury homes on
an 8.7-acre portion of the property that had once been considered for
parkland. Along with Parks, the commissioners--plus Bill-de la
Pena--questioned whether building on this site required a public vote
and asked for more time to study the issue. But city officials
insisted a vote wasn't needed because the site was never approved as
parkland.</TE>
<TE>   The council voted 3 to 2 to censure Parks, oust Farris and Aidukas
and request an investigation. The district attorney's office later
determined that the accusations were without merit.</TE>
<TE>   Farris has since sued the city, with the help of slow-growth
attorney Richard Francis, to force a public vote on whether luxury
homes should be permitted on the 8.7 acres. A trial is scheduled in
October.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County supervisors approved a $200,000 increase in
compensation Tuesday for consultants working on an environmental
study of the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch housing project.</LD>
<LD>   The report's initial cost was pegged at $100,000. But that was
before Ventura County officials received 6,000 pages of public
comments on the proposed subdivision, many of them challenging the
adequacy of the study.</LD>

the degree of the crime.</LD>
<LD>   After Judge Ken Riley's decision at an arraignment hearing
Tuesday, defense attorney Neil Quinn declined to enter a plea on
behalf of Sanchez.</LD>
<LD>   Riley then entered a not guilty plea for the defendant.</LD>
<TE>   A trial date was set for Sept. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, a 31-year-old unemployed handyman from Simi Valley, has
been charged with first-degree murder, attempted rape and attempted
kidnapping in connection with the July 2001 shooting death of Megan
Barroso, a 20-year-old student at Moorpark College.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A probate judge has ruled that the stepdaughter of Orange County
developer Henry T. Segerstrom may inherit a trust established by her
late mother, but that she is not entitled to collect her mother's
artwork, antiques and furniture.</LD>
<LD>   Mikette Von Issenberg, 53, the daughter of local arts patron Renee
Mary Segerstrom, will receive the proceeds of three real estate
properties.</LD>
<LD>   Issenberg had battled Segerstrom for almost two years, saying that
her stepfather was holding her inheritance hostage.</LD>
<TE>   Segerstrom denied that claim, and said he was merely seeking a
judge's opinion on how to untangle the conflicting bequests of his
late wife, who died in June 2000.</TE>

<HD>Council Halts Evictions, Will Tighten Law</HD>
<DH>Housing: Officials say landlords are using a rehabilitation
provision to oust tenants and raise rent. Apartment owners say
moratorium will prevent improvements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a major victory for tenants rights groups, the Los Angeles City
Council approved a six-month moratorium Tuesday on evictions by
landlords who are rehabilitating their apartments.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said they are moving to prevent such evictions
because some landlords have used rehabilitation work as a pretext for
evicting tenants and raising rents.</LD>
<LD>   The council said it would use the six months to close a loophole
in the Rent Stabilization Ordinance that allowed such evictions.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not just one or two cases, it's evident, throughout the
city," said Councilman Ed Reyes, who proposed the change.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be able to conduct a study in order to ... identify
what is rehabilitation as opposed to a cosmetic fix," Reyes said.</TE>
<TE>   The moratorium was opposed by the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los
Angeles and by the owners of the 795-unit Lincoln Place Apartments in
Venice, which is undergoing rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Property owners objected that they will be blocked from making
legitimate improvements as long as the rule is in effect.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials said they need the time to study a provision of
the rent stabilization ordinance that allows landlords to evict
tenants when an apartment is undergoing a major rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   The provision allows landlords to evict when three criteria are
met:</TE>
<TE>   * The work costs $10,000 per unit or more.</TE>
<TE>   * The work requires that the unit be vacant for at least 45 days.</TE>
<TE>   * At least $9,000 of the work requires city permits.</TE>
<TE>   But critics said the $10,000 figure was set in the late 1980s and
does not reflect the true cost of major rehabilitation in today's
market.</TE>
<TE>   They say that means that tenants can be forced to leave their
homes for minor repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Landlords have taken advantage of the law, said Larry Gross,
executive director of the Coalition for Economic Survival.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about making repairs to substandard or slum housing,"
said Gross, a key backer of the moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about landlords and developers gentrifying affordable
housing and getting higher rents."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Los Angeles Housing Department received 111
landlord declarations of intent to evict for purposes of major
rehabilitation, more than 12 times the number received in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Many more tenants lose their apartments because they do not know
their rights and are intimidated into leaving, said Elena Popp,
directing attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Discussion of the moratorium has also shed light on the city's
failure to enforce certain provisions of the ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Under the rent stabilization ordinance, landlords who evict
tenants for the purpose of major rehabilitation must offer 25% of the
renovated units to previous tenants, at the previous rent.</TE>
<TE>   The rule applies when four or more units are renovated.</TE>
<TE>   When an owner has stated his intent to evict for the purpose of
major rehabilitation, the city issues re-rental certificates, a
process designed to ensure that renovated units are being offered to
previous tenants.</TE>
<TE>   But between 2000 and 2002 the city received 22 re-rental
applications and processed six.</TE>
<TE>   Garry Pinney, general manager of the city's Housing Department,
said the department has insufficient staff to deal with a growing
number of complaints and other issues requiring investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years the workload has increased by 150%, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are responding to this skyrocketing workload demand with
request for additional staff to meet that," Pinney said.</TE>
<TE>   The department was recently authorized to hire an additional
person to work on issues that arise from major apartment
rehabilitations.</TE>
<TE>   While the moratorium won wide praise from tenant groups, whose
members filled the City Council chambers Tuesday, landlords argued
that the moratorium will discourage landlords and cause the
deterioration of the city's housing stock.</TE>
<TE>   "For the City Council to adopt a program that says, 'We don't want
buildings upgraded' is short-sighted and foolish," said Charles Isham
of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Allan J. Abshez, an attorney for Lincoln Place Apartments in
Venice, charged that the moratorium is a response to a long-running
dispute over the fate of the 795-unit complex.</TE>
<TE>   Owners wanted to demolish the housing units, but were prohibited
by the city from doing so, Abshez said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the city is saying you can't rehabilitate them. What is the
owner supposed to do?"</TE>
<TE>   The owners are in litigation with the city over Lincoln Place.</TE>
<TE>   But council members said their action was designed to block unfair
evictions citywide.</TE>
<TE>   The Lincoln Place Tenants Assn., along with residents of Magnolia
Park Apartments in Sherman Oaks and others, appeared at several
hearings on the moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt in order to protect our tenancy, we needed to have this
moratorium," said Sheila Bernard, the president of the tenants
association at the Venice complex.</TE>
<TE>   "For this discussion to be at all fair and balanced we can't be at
threat of losing our homes," Bernard said.</TE>
<TE>   Judi Mesisca became an advocate for tenants and the moratorium
when she learned that the new owners of her building in Sherman Oaks
planned to evict tenants, including many elderly residents, under the
major rehabilitation provision.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you tell somebody who's lived here 27 years?" Mesisca
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the people and they need help."</TE>

$157-million expansion of its casino to add a 105-room hotel,
convention hall and health center.</LD>
<LD>   Tribal leaders addressed complaints about the project by scaling
it back from five stories to four and building fewer rooms.</LD>
<LD>   For months, the project has been opposed by many community members
concerned about traffic control at the casino entrance on California

<LD>The Army Corps of Engineers said it plans to spend $200 million over
the next 20 years to clean up about 2,000 acres of an old Army camp
that has been turned over to private use 45 miles northeast of here.</LD>
<LD>   The agency anticipates it will take decades to clean up the former
Camp Beale, where soldiers trained during and after World War II. The
camp once had bombing, rifle, mortar, demolition and machine gun
ranges.</LD>
<LD>   Nationwide, there are 2,743 such sites that require cleanup,
officials said. More than 400 sites are in California, which has more
than twice as many as any other state.</LD>

<HD>County Probe Finds 34% of Retailers Overcharged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Undercover investigators surveying retail stores across Los Angeles
County were overcharged on one or more items more than a third of the
time, county officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the county's Buyer Beware Program, a newly enlarged
staff of inspectors tested 537 grocery, department store and other
retail outlets from mid-February through last week, buying as many as
15 items per store.</LD>
<LD>   At 184, or 34%, of those stores, inspectors were charged more at
the checkout counters on at least one item than the price listed on
shelves, according to the county Department of Weights and Measures,
which oversees the program.</LD>
<TE>   Although department officials would not identify individual
retailers, an interim report to the Board of Supervisors this month
noted that the highest rate of overcharges came from auto supply
stores, department stores and music and video stores. Variety stores
and those that sell shoes and specialty clothing were among the most
accurate, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "With respect to overcharges, there is zero tolerance," said
Warren Dias, who leads the county department's price verification
division. "To me, 34% overcharges is high."</TE>
<TE>   But some retailers said the report doesn't tell the full story,
because it doesn't include undercharges--in which registers ring up a
lower-than-posted price--and because inspectors don't pick a random
sample of items at a store.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, county inspectors target sale and advertised items, which
are among those most frequently miscalculated at checkout counters
because of frequent price changes.</TE>
<TE>   "They are doing consumers a disservice by giving them partial
information," said Mallory Duncan, general counsel for the National
Retail Federation in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Overcharges occur most commonly because of human error. Scanners,
which read bar codes on items at checkout counters, are almost
foolproof in charging the price the merchant entered into the main
computer system, according to industry experts.</TE>
<TE>   The Buyer Beware Program began after a three-week test during the
2001 holiday season found overcharges in 10% of items bought in 108
non-grocery retail stores. Inspectors said they were overcharged at
80% of Kmart, Macy's and Wal-Mart stores surveyed. Stores found
guilty of overcharging will be required to post signs about their
infractions at entrances.</TE>

<HD>Alleged Extortion of Actor Detailed</HD>
<DH>Court: Brief says mobsters tried to force Steven Seagal to
pay thousands of dollars for not appearing in his ex-partner's films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BROOKLYN, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>New York-based Mafia figures pursued their attempted extortion of a
"petrified" Steven Seagal in Canada, on the West Coast and in a
restaurant here, according to newly filed court papers.</LD>
<LD>   In one episode resembling a scene from "The Godfather," Seagal's
former producing partner, Julius "Jules" R. Nasso, startled the
action star by switching the location of a meeting "at the last
moment" and taking him to the Brooklyn restaurant, where mob captain
Anthony "Sonny" Ciccone demanded money from the actor, federal
prosecutors said in a legal brief.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks later, an FBI bug recorded the mob crew joking about the
incident, the brief added.</LD>
<TE>   After Ciccone bragged to associates of how he "didn't acknowledge"
the movie star at the restaurant, his right-hand man commented, "I
wish we had a gun on us; that would have been funny," according to
the brief.</TE>
<TE>   Then Julius Nasso's brother, Vincent, is quoted as quipping, "It
was like right out of the movies."</TE>
<TE>   The evidence is detailed in a 52-page brief that led a judge here
Tuesday to continue to deny bail to Ciccone, 67, whom the government
describes as the Gambino crime family capo "responsible for
overseeing ... criminal interests on the waterfront."</TE>
<TE>   Ciccone was among 17 alleged mob leaders, soldiers and associates
arrested last month under an indictment charging them with numerous
schemes to extort individuals and companies doing business around the
Brooklyn and Staten Island docks.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials said their eavesdropping stumbled onto
the plot to extort hundreds of thousands of dollars from "an
individual in the film industry," whom attorneys in the case have
identified as Seagal, the rugged martial arts expert who burst to
stardom in 1988 and created his own production company, with "Jules"
Nasso, 49, as his producing partner for more than a decade until they
split up two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The split led to a $60-million lawsuit, filed in March, in which
Nasso alleged that the star of "Under Siege" and other hit movies had
fallen under the influence of a Buddhist sect and refused to do four
movies for which Nasso had already sold the foreign rights.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, at the time the partnership was coming
apart in the summer of 2000, and while Seagal was filming "Exit
Wounds" for Warner Bros. in Toronto, the Nasso brothers, Ciccone and
the capo's chief enforcer "traveled to Canada ... to initiate the
extortion."</TE>
<TE>   The Brooklyn restaurant meeting took place the following Feb. 2,
the brief says, and soon after "Ciccone asked J. Nasso if he had
demanded $150,000 per movie from the victim."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take care of it," Nasso says.</TE>
<TE>   "We said that day that we were gonna tell him that every movie he
makes we want $150,000. [And] he puts you in on it," Ciccone says.</TE>
<TE>   The brief says Nasso then urged the mob captain to be "even more
forceful" with Seagal, saying, "We had ... a nice initial meeting to
break the ice. But I think the next one, you gotta get, you really
gotta get down on him.... 'Cause I know this animal, I know this
beast."</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, the mob group "traveled across the country to make
additional demands in person," the brief says, and "law enforcement
surveilled them and took photographs."</TE>
<TE>   Later, the mob figures became concerned because Seagal was talking
about the threats, the brief says, so Ciccone instructed Vincent
Nasso to "smooth this guy over."</TE>
<TE>   At yet another meeting, Ciccone berates Jules Nasso for telling
others that he had gotten the mob captain's permission to file his
suit against Seagal, according to the brief.</TE>
<TE>   "You said to me, I'll cover you," Nasso replies.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't tell you to go out and put it in the ... newspaper."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry," says Nasso, who is free on $1.5-million bail and
facing extortion conspiracy charges.</TE>

<HD>Daughter to Inherit From Renee Segerstrom Trust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A probate judge has ruled that the stepdaughter of Orange County
developer Henry T. Segerstrom may inherit a trust established by her
late mother, but that she is not entitled to collect her mother's
artwork, antiques and furniture.</LD>
<LD>   Mikette Von Issenberg, 53, the daughter of local arts patron Renee
Mary Segerstrom, will now receive the proceeds of three real estate
properties. Issenberg had battled Segerstrom for almost two years,
saying that her stepfather was holding her inheritance hostage.
Segerstrom said that he was merely seeking a judge's opinion on how
to untangle the conflicting bequests of his late wife.</LD>
<LD>   Renee Segerstrom, 72, died in June 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The recent ruling by Judge Richard O. Frazee does not specify how
much Issenberg will collect, since the value has yet to be
determined. Issenberg and her lawyer say the value could be as high
as $10 million, while lawyers for the 79-year-old Segerstrom say it
is just under $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The hope is now that the parties can sit down and work this out
without further litigation,'' said Michele D. Johnson, Segerstrom's
lawyer.</TE>

<HD>SOAR Files Suit to Pull Open 80 Plan From Fall Ballot</HD>
<DH>Ventura: Slow-growth group argues a measure to approve a
1,390-home hillside project is illegal. Proponents say owners want to
leave a legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Slow-growth advocates filed suit Tuesday to remove a measure from the
November ballot that seeks voter approval for a large housing project
on Ventura's hillsides.</LD>
<LD>   SOAR Inc. is challenging the constitutionality of the Open 80
Master Plan Act of 2002, which would allow up to 1,390 homes on the
rolling hills of sage-scrub and chaparral that serve as a backdrop to
the city.</LD>
<LD>   Though SOAR wants voters to weigh in on development issues, this
measure steps over the legal limits of the state's initiative
process, said Richard Francis, the group's attorney. The measure is
not legislation but a development agreement, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Furthermore, the suit filed in Ventura County Superior Court
claims the initiative violates a section of the state Constitution
that prohibits citizen-sponsored ballot measures from benefiting any
specified individual or corporation.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't write a contract that benefits you personally or your
company and then slide that in front of the voters," said Ventura
County Supervisor Steve Bennett, one of the founders of SOAR. "That
means no one was there to protect the taxpayers."</TE>
<TE>   The Open 80 plan seeks to build homes on family-owned land north
of Ventura's downtown, while dedicating more than 3,000 acres--or 80%
of the land--as open space. An initiative that was passed in November
prohibits extending city services onto the hillsides without voter
approval.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura City Council members sent the Open 80 initiative to the
Nov. 5 ballot earlier this month, after a successful petition drive
sponsored by the landowners, the pioneering Lloyd and Dabney
families.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Halter, a Ventura activist and supporter of the Open 80 plan,
accused Bennett of embarking on a "cynical and hypocritical strategy"
to stop the project before voters get the chance to speak at the
ballot box.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit appears to be without merit, he said in a written
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "We are concerned that Bennett's real motive for filing the
lawsuit is to keep [the measure] off the ballot, thereby preventing
the people's right to vote," he said. "We think this is wrong, and we
believe the public will see it as wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett denied that the suit is a tactic to stop hillside
development, which he said SOAR prefers to building on agricultural
land.</TE>
<TE>   He said there are many ways in which project proponents could have
complied with both Ventura's growth-control law and the state
Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Had the developer completed an environmental study of the plan and
gained City Council approval before giving voters the final say,
Bennett said, SOAR would not have challenged that ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   The group was worried about the precedent the Ventura initiative
might set in growth-controlled areas throughout the county, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "Every developer would love to lock in approvals for a project
before doing an environmental impact report," Bennett said. "Just
because that's what developers want doesn't make it constitutional or
appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of Open 80 argue that the housing project is not about
greedy developers, but landowners who have a long history with the
city and want to leave a legacy. The open-space portion of the
proposal is a "tremendous gift," Halter said.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Mailers Now Subject to Gift Limits</HD>
<DH>Politics: County extends $1,000 contribution cap. The
Coad-Norby race prompted the change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an attempt to control spending in political races, Orange County
will begin regulating slate mailers devoted primarily to supporting
or opposing a single candidate.</LD>
<LD>   An amendment to the county's campaign reform ordinance approved
Tuesday extends its $1,000 contribution limit to cover slate mailers
produced or distributed with the cooperation of a candidate's
campaign. The candidate now will have to pay his or her share of the
mailer's costs, which typically far exceed the $1,000 limit.</LD>
<LD>   The reforms were suggested after the March election by longtime
government watchdog Shirley Grindle in response to a hard-fought race
between county Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad and
Supervisor-elect Chris Norby. Coad was the subject of more than a
dozen critical mailers from a slate-mailer organization run by
opponents of a proposed airport at the closed El Toro Marine base.
Coad supported an airport; Norby opposed one.</LD>
<TE>   Coad said it was impossible to track who paid for the mailers
because the anti-airport group reported making only a single $440,000
contribution to the slate organization.</TE>
<TE>   Norby's campaign estimated that the mailers cost about $160,000.
Other consultants estimated they cost at least $420,000.</TE>
<TE>   Norby said the mailers were legal and helped him counteract Coad's
personal wealth in the campaign. She lent her campaign about $500,000
for the race. State and federal law allow unlimited spending by a
candidate on their own race.</TE>
<TE>   Slate mailers traditionally promote four or more candidates or
ballot issues. The mailers targeting Coad--sent by Voter Education
Project, run by anti-airport consultants Arnold Forde and Stu
Mollrich--devoted most of their space to attacking Coad's positions,
with only a small portion reserved for other candidates and issues.</TE>
<TE>   The revisions approved Tuesday require candidates to pay the cost
of mailers where more than 25% of the surface area is devoted to
promoting their candidacy or attacking an opponent. The amount will
be subject to the $1,000 limit.</TE>

<HD>Neighbor Charged With Murder in 4 Slayings</HD>
<DH>Court: The suspect could get death if convicted of killing
the South Whittier family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state filed capital murder charges Tuesday against Alfonso
Morales, setting the stage for a possible death penalty against the
man accused of murdering four South Whittier neighbors, including a
former co-worker and an 8-year-old girl.</LD>
<LD>   Morales, 23, was charged with eight counts of murder, robbery,
burglary, and sex offenses against a child.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office won't decide
whether to seek execution until later, said Ken E. Lamb, the
prosecutor handling the case.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a terrible crime," said Lamb, referring to the crime
scene that veteran Sheriff's Department homicide investigators said
is among the worst they have seen. Blood stained the walls and
ceilings, and the four victims had been dragged from room to room,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Morales used a knife to kill four family members, according to the
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   He appeared in Whittier Municipal Court before Commissioner Gerald
N. Mansfield. Outside after the hearing, a crush of news
photographers surrounded three lawyers representing Morales.</TE>
<TE>   Morales "is not guilty of these crimes," said defense attorney
Robert Sheahen.</TE>
<TE>   Also appearing for the defense were Alison F. Triessl and Sharon
Beth Morris. The three often work together. Morales family members
declined to comment, and the defense team offered few details about
their strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Sheahen provided a written release stating that "along with the
rest of their South Whittier neighbors, the Morales family expresses
their deepest sympathy to the Ruiz family for their extraordinary
loss."</TE>
<TE>   The family "intends to give their full support to the defense of"
Morales, according to the statement.</TE>
<TE>   The husky Morales, wearing a yellow jail uniform, did not look at
those in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Attending were his mother and stepfather as well as relatives of
the victims: Miguel Ruiz, 38; his wife, Maritza Trejo, 41; their
8-year-old daughter, Jasmin; and Ruiz's grandmother, Ana Luisa
Martinez, 79.</TE>
<TE>   Looking down, Morales answered softly, "Yes," when Mansfield asked
whether he understood that he had a right to be arraigned that day
and whether he wished to waive that right.</TE>
<TE>   As the commissioner postponed the arraignment, someone in the
audience yelled at Morales that he was a murderer. "It's
understandable," said Lamb, the prosecutor, about the outburst.
"These people are still grieving.... It has to be one of the most
difficult things to happen to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators and neighbors who know Morales described him as a
polite young man, a part-time security guard who also worked with
Ruiz, one of the victims, fixing computers.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Morales had been a good friend of the victims
for years. Ruiz had taken Morales under his wing, teaching him how to
repair computers. Jasmin often played with Morales' niece, neighbors
said.</TE>
<TE>   But within the last month, homicide investigators contend, Morales
had had a falling out with Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies were discovered Saturday by an older daughter who went
to the Ruizes' house on Gunn Avenue in South Whittier to check up on
the family.</TE>

<HD>State's Teachers Second-Highest Paid in Nation</HD>
<DH>Education: Average salary increases 10% to $52,480 a year.
But California's national ranking drops to 16th when the cost of
living is factored into wages.</DH>

<LD>The average pay of California's public schoolteachers rose 10% last
year to $52,480, boosting the state's ranking from seventh- to
second-highest paying for educators in the nation, according to a
report released Tuesday by the American Federation of Teachers.</LD>
<LD>   The state also ranked second in the nation in pay for new
teachers, starting them at an average of $33,121, the union's report
found.</LD>
<LD>   California "is in a very small category by itself because most
states forget about experienced teachers and concentrate on
recruiting new teachers to the profession," said Janet Bass, a
spokeswoman for the American Federation of Teachers. "California did
both. These are good numbers."</LD>
<TE>   Once the cost of living is factored into teachers' salaries,
however, California's rank drops from second to 16th, according to
the survey.</TE>
<TE>   And some worry that such hikes came during secure financial times
and won't continue this year because of a gloomier economic climate.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect things are going to level off again because of the cuts
we are facing," said Mary Bergan, president of the California
Federation of Teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "Plus we are facing big battles at the table about health
benefits."</TE>
<TE>   John Perez, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said the
report will do little to cheer Los Angeles Unified School District
teachers, who have not seen a pay raise in two years.</TE>
<TE>   "While it's nice to see that national pay for teachers has
increased, locally that means very little," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perez said Los Angeles Unified teachers deserve much higher
salaries to compensate for the local cost of living, and are trying
to fight off proposals that may raise their out-of-pocket costs for
health care.</TE>
<TE>   New teachers in Los Angeles Unified with a bachelor's degree earn
a beginning salary of $32,569, according to the district. The minimum
salary for teachers who have a master's degree is $45,166.</TE>
<TE>   The annual report, compiled this year with numbers received by
state departments of education from 2000 to 2001, found that the
nationwide average for beginning teachers has risen 4.4% to $28,986.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers across the country have 16 years' experience on average
and earn $43,250, a 3.4% increase over the previous year but one of
the smallest raises in 40 years, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing some progress is being made to boost beginning
teacher salaries, and that is clearly a response to a teacher
shortage," said Bass, the AFTspokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're not seeing as much progress for veteran teachers.
That's just as important because we need to retain good teachers."</TE>
<TE>   California teachers' average earnings of $52,480 were second to
Connecticut's pay of $53,507. New Jersey, New York and Michigan were
the next three highest-paying states.</TE>
<TE>   States with the lowest average pay for teachers in 2001 were South
Dakota, at $30,265; North Dakota, $30,891; and Mississippi, $31,954.</TE>
<TE>   California's average new teacher pay of $33,121 was topped only by
Alaska's $36,293. New York, Delaware and Connecticut fell slightly
behind California. The lowest average beginning salaries were in
North Dakota, at $20,675; Montana, $21,728; and South Dakota,
$22,457.</TE>
<TE>   Average teacher salaries still lagged behind other white-collar
fields, including mid-level accountants, who earned an average of
$52,664 a year; computer system analysts, $71,155; engineers,
$74,920; and attorneys, $82,712, the report states.</TE>
<TE>   The average nationwide new teacher salary of $28,986 also lagged
behind other professions for new college graduates.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting graduates were offered an average of $37,143; sales and
marketing graduates, $40,033; and engineering graduates, $50,033, the
survey found.</TE>

<CX>   Teacher pay--An article in Wednesday's California section about a
rise in average pay for California teachers misstated the minimum
salary for a teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District. New
teachers with bachelor's degrees may earn a minimum annual salary of
$34,853 and those with master's degrees may earn a minimum of
$40,504, according to the district. The somewhat higher figures in
the article reflected average starting salaries.</CX>

<HD>Board Wants Sewage Treated Further</HD>
<DH>Policy: O.C. supervisors vote for cleaning waste more
before it's dumped into the sea. Sanitation district will vote today
on seeking extension of Clean Water Act waiver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Board of Supervisors joined a coalition of cities
and environmentalists Tuesday in urging sanitation district officials
to perform greater treatment of sewage dumped into the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   The move came a day before the Orange County Sanitation District
takes its pivotal vote on the treatment issue.</LD>
<LD>   The district's 25-member board will decide tonight whether to seek
another five-year waiver allowing it to bypass requirements of the
federal Clean Water Act.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm getting a lot of strong support for getting rid of the
waiver," said Supervisor Tom Wilson, who will represent the county in
the vote. "Orange County should step up and take action and
demonstrate that we're willing to help improve water quality in the
ocean."</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad joined Wilson and Supervisor Jim
Silva, who recommended that the board push for fuller treatment of
sewage pumped about four miles off Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Silva's district includes the coastal city, whose merchants
suffered losses in 1999 when miles of beaches were closed because of
high bacteria counts in the water.</TE>
<TE>   A study by the sanitation district didn't pinpoint the source of
pollution that closed the beaches but didn't rule out the sewage
plume.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to today's vote, I was hoping we'd have proof of where the
contamination was coming from," Coad said. "But [greater treatment]
is something that has to be done. We may as well do it now as later."</TE>
<TE>   The district's waiver allows it to give primary and secondary
treatment to half of the waste it pumps to the ocean. The rest is
given only primary treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Of about 16,000 sanitation districts nationwide, only 36 have such
waivers.</TE>
<TE>   The district has contended that there is no proof that fuller
treatment would stop beach contamination.</TE>
<TE>   A new plant to remove additional solids would cost as much as $430
million, which the district contends would double some sewer rates
over the next 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation meeting begins at 6 p.m. at district offices, 10844
Ellis Ave., Fountain Valley.</TE>

<HD>College District Trustees Vote to Put Westin on Leave
During Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District voted
unanimously Tuesday night to place embattled Chancellor Philip Westin
on administrative leave while they evaluate his performance and
investigate his expenditures.</LD>
<LD>   The board's decision came hours after a law firm announced it had
filed a lawsuit against Westin and the district seeking to nullify
his contract.</LD>
<LD>   "It's time we give the community college district back to the
taxpayers and the students," said Greg Ramirez, an attorney with the
Ventura law firm, announcing the suit at a news conference outside
the Camarillo auditorium where the trustees met.</LD>
<TE>   Carrying signs that said "Taxpayers Give Trustees Straight F's"
and "Adios Phil," dozens of protesters turned out to demand Westin's
resignation during the public speaker's portion of the board meeting.
Westin is on vacation and could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The chancellor, who was recently awarded a new four-year contract
and a $30,000 pay raise, has been under fire over revelations that he
charged the district more than $119,000 in business-related expenses
from 1997 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Rosin, a Camarillo resident and former government studies
instructor at Ventura College, told the trustees that he used to tell
his students that the board set a good example for governing.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a mistake," Rosin said. "You are an example I would use as
bad government. Whether you ask for Westin's resignation or not,
either way it's a bad decision. It's going to cost the district if he
leaves, and it's going to cost the district if he stays."</TE>
<TE>   Jayna Call, an 18-year-old student, said that she and her friends
at Ventura College had only recently paid attention to the Westin
ordeal but were concerned about the fallout.</TE>
<TE>   Westin's expenditures "come out of my paycheck," Call said. "These
are educators. They are supposed to be teaching us, but what are they
teaching us? Embezzlement? Misuse of power?"</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit filed against the district on behalf of Ventura County
taxpayers asks to immediately rescind Westin's $203,000-a-year
contract, alleging trustees approved the agreement under "fraudulent
representations" and inadequate information.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit demands that the district stop paying Westin, and
seeks to bar it from paying the chancellor the $305,000 necessary to
buy out his contract "because he is guilty of willful misconduct."</TE>
<TE>   It also asks for restitution of an undetermined amount of money,
alleging Westin and district officials squandered thousands of
taxpayer dollars on unnecessary trips and perks and engaged in
unethical practices.</TE>
<TE>   Following is a list of some of the allegations outlined in the
lawsuit:</TE>
<TE>   * Westin and board President Norman Nagel charged the district
$3,000 for a trip to Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "Both Westin and Nagel knew, or had reason to know," the lawsuit
states, "that they were not allowed to have the district reimburse
them for this expense, as the trip did not involve any business of
the district, and did not benefit the district in any way."</TE>
<TE>   * Westin charged $1,976 to the district to rent a Pontiac Grand
Prix for his personal use in September and October 2001, while paying
him for mileage, automobile repairs and other related expenses for
his personal vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   * Nagel charged $1,515 to the district to rent a Pontiac
Bonneville for two months in the fall of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   * Westin was reimbursed $1,600 for an outdoor lighting system
purchased for his home.</TE>
<TE>   * Westin and Vice Chancellor Michael Gregoryk awarded a $5-million
contract to an electrical firm while failing to follow the district's
bidding policy.</TE>
<TE>   In return, the contractor "gave Westin and Gregoryk an all-expense
paid trip to the Golf National Championships in Augusta, Ga."</TE>
<TE>   * Westin approved the use of Ventura County Community College
District Foundation money to pay for a golf membership at Spanish
Hills Country Club for Gregoryk.</TE>
<TE>   During Tuesday's board meeting, Nagel said he wished to address
some of the allegations made in the lawsuit but was advised against
speaking on a pending legal matter.</TE>
<TE>   At an earlier news conference, Ramirez was joined by Gerald
Leavitt, a retired probation officer, and Gerard Kapuscik, a county
employee, both of whom are named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit along
with county taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez's firm represents Paula Munoz, a Ventura College counselor
who sued the district after she was suspended without pay earlier
this year. Her lawsuit has yet to be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The Westin controversy erupted in March when the Camarillo law
firm of Wood &amp; Bender presented trustees with a 3-inch-thick report
detailing the chancellor's expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   Of that amount, $46,000 was listed as questionable, essentially
those expenses lacking receipts or adequate documentation.</TE>
<TE>   Included were $22,300 for car repairs, $12,700 for equipment and
supplies, $7,600 for computer software, $1,600 for travel upgrades
and $1,700 for miscellaneous.</TE>
<TE>   Expenses Found Legally Permissible</TE>
<TE>   Trustees at first sought Westin's resignation but changed their
mind after hiring an auditor who examined the expenses and determined
they were legally permissible.</TE>
<TE>   Westin also filed a complaint with the State Bar of California,
accusing one of the law firm's partners, David Bender, of compiling
the report in an attempt to oust Westin because he had declined to
steer legal work to Bender's firm. Bender has denied the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the board voted 4 to 1 to award Westin a new contract,
which included a 16% pay raise and a $1,500-a-month car allowance.
Trustee John Tallman, a longtime Westin critic, dissented.</TE>
<TE>   The board's action and disclosures of Westin's spending practices
have unleashed a torrent of rage among the public, college faculty,
taxpayer advocates and community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Some board members have defended their actions, saying Westin's
raise brought his salary closer to that of chancellors from
similar-sized districts. They said keeping stability within the
administration would help ensure low-interest financing for a
$356-million, voter-approved bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   Westin has adopted voluntary spending limits on meals and other
business-related expenses, while the board develops a new district
policy.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit claims that Westin, Nagel, the district and the
Ventura County Community College District Foundation have racked up
an unspecified amount of questionable expenses since 1996 when Westin
was hired.</TE>
<TE>   It seeks an accounting of all expenditures by Westin, trustees and
administrators and restitution with 10% interest.</TE>
<TE>   The suit claims the district's legal counsel, Jack Lipton,
inadequately represented the district during contract negotiations
last spring because of his friendship with Westin.</TE>
<TE>   It also claims that Gregoryk told the board that up-to-date budget
figures were unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time he made this representation, Gregoryk had figures
available and knew, or had reason to know, the district was facing a
$7-million shortfall," the seven-page document states.</TE>
<TE>   "If the trustees had been truthfully advised of the financial
conditions of the district, they would not have voted to give Westin
the new employment contract."</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Will Tighten Control of Cyber Cafes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana is curtailing the hours that cyber cafes can operate and
requiring owners to use surveillance cameras in an effort to prevent
violence.</LD>
<LD>   The ordinance passed by the City Council on Monday night and
effective immediately comes just weeks after Garden Grove tightened
its laws regulating similar businesses that rent computers, often to
young people who play computer games and chat with friends online.
One young man was killed June 8 in Garden Grove after leaving a cyber
cafe.</LD>
<LD>   While Santa Ana's four cyber cafes have generated noise and
loitering, no major crimes have been reported.</LD>
<TE>   City Manager David Ream said there's "enough indication of
possible problems that we wanted to get on it."</TE>
<TE>   No opposition has surfaced so far among local club owners,
contrary to what has occurred in Garden Grove. That city's 19 cyber
cafe owners are considering legal challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove Mayor Bruce Broadwater said, "We have a right to
enforce our laws. We did have a shooting here. We enforce liquor
laws, laws at pool halls too."</TE>

<HD>Rewarding 'Good Apples'</HD>
<DH>Punishment alone won't cure our ills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The corruption of business and the decay of values besetting our
nation reach toward a heightened question: What is the meaning of
this treasured thing we call freedom? Not in the abstract or the
grandiose, but freedom in the day-to-day conduct of our lives, in our
expectations for ourselves, our institutions and our country.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, when the meaning of freedom is in play in the
United States, there is that old Catch-22. Free people set the terms
of freedom for themselves. In this free country right now, it matters
not whether the exercise of freedom serves only the self, even if at
the expense of others. To challenge that idea, we are told, is an
infringement on freedom. One is free to believe that freedom entails
corresponding responsibilities, or that it does not.</LD>
<LD>   Thus, even with our nation under attack, 37% of college students
polled last month said they would evade military service if drafted.
Freedom, we see, is one of those things that can circle around and
swallow itself by the tail.</LD>
<TE>   In this poll, commissioned by William J. Bennett's Americans for
Victory Over Terrorism, 79% of college students said they believed
that Western culture, with its wide-open freedoms and promises of
self-determination, was not superior to Arab culture, which lacks a
single democratic example among nations and offers citizens almost
none of the freedoms we take for granted except, of course, the
freedom for some individuals to accumulate wealth. That's a freedom
that Osama bin Laden and Saudi oil princes relish.</TE>
<TE>   In the years before the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln stated that
true freedom allowed that "each man should do precisely as he pleases
with all which is exclusively his." But, as Lincoln recognized a few
years later, freedom without principles at the center can be its own
tyranny. The war between the states took half a million lives to
settle the most fundamental question of freedom: freedom for slaves
versus the freedom to own slaves.</TE>
<TE>   Now another divide separates Americans. The reckless freedom to
pursue self-interest, most extravagantly displayed by entrepreneurs
with their disregard of all else, has taken a toll on the faith and
futures of millions of people. Yes, millions.</TE>
<TE>   The "bad apple" theory of corporate responsibility ignores the
naked fact: Our system offers too few incentives anymore for "good
apples."</TE>
<TE>   Those Americans who live by principle, who still believe in
citizenship, who hold faith in the axiom that honest work counts
most, they may take satisfaction if a few of the greediest corporate
knaves are made to squirm and suffer. But good apples deserve more
out of this mess: They rate a rejuvenated system tilted in favor of
duty, honor, obligation, progress--all those old-fashioned ideals
that once defined freedom.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the ship of state could use some ballast along
with the fancy superstructure. It's one thing, as the president has
done, to exhort high principles. It's another, which he overlooks, to
reward these values above narcissism--beginning, perhaps, with tax
revisions to favor the fruits of work over trust fund income or the
dumb luck of inheritance. Also, tax laws that reward volunteerism the
same as philanthropy. And laws that encourage companies to invest in
the United States and American workers--not out of xenophobia but in
support of the ideals and institutions that make their success
possible.</TE>
<TE>   The government is overdue in restoring our founding principles and
granting corporate charters in the public interest, not singularly
for the benefit of business. One could dream up 50 good ideas in this
vein.</TE>
<TE>   It may make ledger-book sense these days for a company like Aquila
Inc. to pay $30 million in bonuses to executives who fire 500
employees with the goal of saving shareholders $35 million in
payroll. But it should not. It's neither saccharine nor Pollyannaish
to say that freedom would mean more if incentives were recalibrated
to favor those who build rather than tear down. Adam Smith, sage of
modern free-market philosophy, is sometimes overlooked for his
contributions to idealism. "How selfish soever man may be supposed,"
he wrote nearly 250 years ago, "there are evidently some principles
in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and
render their happiness necessary to him." In a free society, we have
the freedom to insist that these principles be rewarded, and we
should.</TE>

<HD>Air Force Dodges Sept. 11 Flak</HD>
<DH>Generals 'hadn't thought about' an attack against
Washington. Huh?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDY GOODMAN</AU>
<BD>Sandy Goodman worked as a producer and writer for more
than 25 years on the "NBC Nightly News."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most amazing thing about the blame game now being played over who
was at fault for Sept. 11 is that no one is pointing a finger at the
Air Force. Amazing because it's a lot easier to see why the FBI and
the CIA were unable to connect a series of sometimes wildly divergent
dots than it is to understand why the Air Force had no plan to
protect the nation's capital from an attack by terrorists in planes
at a time when Washington was deluged with warnings of terrorist
threats.</LD>
<LD>   It is even more amazing that, nine months later, the Air Force
still had no workable defense for Washington.</LD>
<LD>   That was made frighteningly clear June 19 when it failed to stop
an off-course single-engine plane from getting near the White House.
The Cessna 182 remained within striking distance for 12 minutes,
flying out before two F-16 fighters from Andrews Air Force Base, 10
miles away, took off after it. Officials said there was no way the
F-16s could have stopped the pilot from hitting the executive mansion
had he wanted to.</LD>
<TE>   That would not have been true right after Sept. 11. The Air Force
originally responded to the attacks by flying 24-hour-a-day fighter
patrols over Washington. But these were dropped in recent weeks
because of stricter airline security and because, at a cost of $50
million a week, they were deemed too expensive. They were replaced by
random patrols and more fighters on ground alert at more bases.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, on Sept. 11 there was not a single fighter plane on
alert at Andrews because the Air Force's North American Aerospace
Defense Command did not consider an attack on the capital by
terrorists in planes probable. This despite the fact that, according
to Time magazine, the CIA had concluded in August that "Al Qaeda was
determined to attack the U.S." What's a more logical U.S. target than
the capital?</TE>
<TE>   Instead, two F-16s had to be scrambled from a base 130 miles away.
They were still 12 minutes away when American Airlines Flight 77
crashed into the Pentagon. In fact, on Sept. 11 only 14 fighter
planes at just seven bases in the entire country were on ground alert
for air defense, according to NORAD spokesmen.</TE>
<TE>   NORAD is supposed to defend this continent against air attack from
abroad. But the primary responsibility for managing the airspace over
the U.S. rests with the civilian Federal Aviation Administration. The
FAA telephoned NORAD after the World Trade Center had been hit twice
and American Flight 77, far off course for its scheduled trip from
Washington to Los Angeles, was suspiciously headed back toward the
capital. But that call came too late.</TE>
<TE>   Other fighters took off to intercept United Airlines Flight 93,
bound from Newark to San Francisco, after it too changed course for
Washington. Officials now say the hijackers planned to hit the White
House, a plot thwarted when passengers forced that airliner to crash
in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force's most damaging admission is that the Sept. 11
attacks were a complete surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "You hate to admit it, but we hadn't thought about this,"
confessed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen.
Richard B. Myers, in an Oct. 17 interview.</TE>
<TE>   Why not? Myers and other generals spend their lives war-gaming
possible attacks on this country. Moreover, authorities knew as far
back as 1995 that terrorists considered crashing a plane into CIA
headquarters. And in July 2001, Italian officials deployed
antiaircraft missiles to protect President Bush against such a threat
at the Group of 8 conference in Genoa.</TE>
<TE>   Given those facts, plus the history of World War II kamikaze
attacks, how many more warnings did the Air Force need?</TE>
<TE>   True, the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency also failed to
pick up on warnings. Those agencies are being relentlessly
scrutinized and criticized by Congress and the press. Not so the Air
Force. There are no demands that it too be investigated.</TE>
<TE>   All the Air Force had to do was heed the ample warnings that the
United States was a terrorist target, reasonably conclude that
Washington probably would be among the first places hit and plan an
air defense.</TE>
<TE>   Such a defense might not have been successful against a hijacked
airliner. But not even to have imagined the possibility of such an
attack, not even to have fighters alerted at Andrews, is inexcusable.
Not to have an effective air defense against a small plane nine
months later is even worse.</TE>

<HD>Call It What It Is: a Global Surge of Anti-Semitism</HD>
<DH>Amid blindness to hate crimes, something familiar and
sinister is arising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YOSSI KLEIN HALEVI</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi, the Israel correspondent for the
New Republic and a senior writer for the Jerusalem Report, is the
author of "At the Entrance to the Garden of Eden: A Jew's Search for
Hope with Christians and Muslims in the Holy Land" (HarperCollins,
2001).</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>For more than a year, French Jews have been targets of hundreds of
violent attacks, initiated mostly by Muslim immigrants. Synagogues
have been burned, cemeteries desecrated and Jews beaten on the
streets. Yet the French government continues to deny that France has
an anti-Semitism problem.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the denial syndrome spread to Toronto, where skinheads
stabbed to death a Jew outside a kosher pizza shop. Despite the fact
that the ultra-Orthodox victim was easily identifiable as a Jew,
Toronto police quickly announced that the attack didn't appear to be
a hate crime.</LD>
<LD>   The chances of a murderous skinhead wandering around an
ultra-Orthodox neighborhood without premeditated intent to kill are
about as likely as an armed Muslim fanatic who just happens to open
fire at a counter of Israel's national airline.</LD>
<TE>   The inability of law enforcement agencies to discern a motive in
the July 4 shooting into a crowd of Jews at Los Angeles International
Airport by a Muslim extremist who hated Jews and accused Israel of
deliberately infecting Arabs with AIDS is hardly an isolated example
of stupidity and self-deception. It's part of a worldwide pattern of
denial in response to increasingly lethal Jew-hatred.</TE>
<TE>   This week's sentencing in Karachi of the killers of Wall Street
Journal reporter Daniel Pearl is a reminder of how the pattern of
self-deception works. Just before he was decapitated, his kidnappers
forced him to tell the video camera, "I am a Jew, my mother is a
Jew." Yet the media's coverage of Pearl's execution focused on Pearl
the American journalist, as if his Jewishness were incidental to his
murder.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, the Arab world has become increasingly
dominated by government-incited Jew-hatred. Holocaust denial is now
mainstream, even among Arab intellectuals.</TE>
<TE>   The official press from Egypt to Saudi Arabia--to say nothing of
Syria and Iraq--publishes the most vile and discredited anti-Semitic
slanders, like the medieval libel accusing Jews of using blood for
ritual observance.</TE>
<TE>   Yet little notice has been paid by the world to the astonishing
phenomenon of a great civilization debasing itself with hatred and
lies. Why the tendency to downplay Jew-hatred?</TE>
<TE>   Partly, perhaps, because decent people find the prospect of the
return of anti-Semitism, a mere half-century after Auschwitz, an
unbearable thought.</TE>
<TE>   Many Jews share that reluctance to face the new reality. We want
to believe that the Holocaust was an aberration, that anti-Semitism,
at least as a mainstream phenomenon, has exhausted itself in shame.</TE>
<TE>   Many of us have justifiably criticized the Jewish community's
obsessive focus on the Holocaust, insisting that we teach our
children the beauty and power of Jewish tradition rather than
frighten them into a victim identity. But while Jews need to be
careful about lapsing into hysteria and self-pity, something familiar
and sinister is stirring again, and we'd be fools to ignore it.</TE>
<TE>   Not coincidentally, the renewal of seemingly random anti-Jewish
violence is being accompanied by an ideological assault against
Zionism and Israel. The assault is being led by Muslim extremists and
anti-globalizers and neo-Nazi Holocaust deniers, a bizarre coalition
uniting far left and far right. And the hatred against Israel is
beginning to penetrate respectable institutions, including
universities.</TE>
<TE>   Criticizing specific Israeli policies is, of course, legitimate;
self-criticism is an Israeli national pastime. But when the United
Nations obsessively searches for a nonexistent massacre of
Palestinians in Jenin while systematically ignoring massacres of
Israelis, when the only country in the corrupt and violent Middle
East to be singled out for judgment is Israel, when the context of
Israel's war for survival is ignored and only Israel's self-defense
is condemned, when the very existence of a Jewish state becomes
immoral and the only form of nationalism considered racist is
Zionism--then the line is crossed from legitimate criticism to
demonization. And the ground is prepared for murder.</TE>
<TE>   Without identifying the illness, we won't be able to treat it. Its
name is Jew-hatred, even if some insist on calling it everything but
what it is.</TE>

<LD>Summertime is movie time as Hollywood releases another potential
blockbuster each week. Here are sneak previews of some coming
offerings:</LD>
<LD>   "Notorious CEO"--He's the coolest, baddest dude in the
marketplace. He's Notorious CEO, the head of ImPlode, one of
America's largest corporations. Even though ImPlode doesn't actually
make or sell anything, Notorious CEO and his bad-boy board of
directors manage to hype the company's share value to record highs.
Will they cash in their options before the public catches on?</LD>
<LD>   "Men in Black III"--This time, the guys in black are the aliens.
Dressed in white collars, these strange creatures claim to be
celibate, but not all of them are. Watch as the authorities try to
track down the worst offenders, who always seem to be one parish
ahead of the law.</LD>
<TE>   "Majority Report"--You're an American politician faced with one
corporate business scandal after another. What do you do? You sign on
to the majority report recommending action, any action, against the
corporate bad guys. Problem is, you may have received political
donations from these bad guys or performed the same type of shady
transaction yourself. See how Congress members, Cabinet members and
presidents manage to talk the talk and avoid the walk.</TE>
<TE>   "Martha and Snitch"--The latest animated film from Disney, this
one follows the hilarious trials and tribulations of a stock-trading
home-making guru named Martha. All is well in Martha's world of home
perfection until Snitch lets it be known that Martha may have had a
little insider info before making her latest stock trade. Enjoy the
fun as everybody jumps on the get-Martha bandwagon.</TE>
<TE>   "The Importance of Appearing Earnest"--A modern twist on the Oscar
Wilde classic, this film features a hilarious case of mistaken
identity. George pretends to be earnest in his condemnation of
corporate misdeeds and "mal-fee-ance." But his evil twin, W., keeps
popping up with candid admissions of shady loans and deals that
embarrass poor George. Will George survive the November midterm
elections unscathed, or will W. take him down like the Dow?</TE>

<LD>While much of Southern California broils, Wendy McCaw and David
Geffen relax amid the cooling breezes that blow through their
oceanfront aeries. McCaw, the billionaire owner of the Santa Barbara
News-Press, has a 25-acre bluff-top pad in Hope Ranch, and Geffen,
the entertainment mogul and philanthropist, beds down in a fine home
on Malibu's Carbon Beach.</LD>
<LD>   California law decrees that the sand and surf near McCaw's and
Geffen's homes belong to the public and guarantees, as well, the
public's right to get to the water, even where private homes block
the way for miles.</LD>
<LD>   The California Coastal Commission, created by popular vote in
1972, oversees development along the state's 1,100-mile coast. In
Southern California, that often means beachfront owners must get
commission approval before remodeling or expanding their property if
their changes might adversely affect the beach or the ocean.</LD>
<TE>   Geffen deeded a public easement across his property in exchange
for commission approval to build a sea wall, enlarge his garage and
build a guest house, maid's quarters, a deck and a swimming pool.
McCaw, when she bought her property, inherited the previous owner's
offer to dedicate an easement in exchange for expanding the house.</TE>
<TE>   But with the sawdust from these remodeling projects long swept
away, McCaw and Geffen have reneged on their promises to the public.
To keep folks from traipsing across his yard to the sea, Geffen shut
the gate to the walkway. He argues that the beach lacks the parking,
lifeguards and restroom facilities needed to accommodate the
public--even though the nonprofit group Access for All, which offered
to take over this easement on behalf of the public, says it has a
plan addressing each of Geffen's stated concerns.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw has so stonewalled the public in court that the Coastal
Commission hit her with $460,000 in fines, which she has now paid.
Undaunted, she's suing to keep Santa Barbara County from formally
acquiring her easement and opening the 500-foot strip of beach below
her home.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw and Geffen are community leaders. McCaw bought the
News-Press two years ago; the foundation that bears her name has
funded a variety of environmental causes, including wildlife
preservation and reducing ocean pollution. Geffen has become a major
philanthropist, recently donating $200 million to the UCLA Medical
School. But neither largess nor power elevates one above the law that
says the coastline belongs to everyone.</TE>

<LD>Members of Congress are accustomed to battling the Pentagon to bring
defense contracts to their districts and keep bases open. A more
important conflict is now brewing: The Defense Department, using the
cover of "too much bureaucracy," is bucking its obligation to provide
full information to Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Tensions between the legislative and executive branches are
nothing new, but the Bush administration has been louder than most in
claiming that the pendulum has swung too far toward Capitol Hill in
recent decades.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has complained that
bureaucracy ties up Pentagon officials, forcing them to spend too
much time answering to Congress. Thus the Pentagon's proposal to do
away with requirements to file hundreds of annual reports, which, the
Pentagon says, usually go unread.</LD>
<TE>   There are equally ambitious plans to ban strikes by Defense
Department civilian contract workers and scrap Civil Service
protection for civilian workers at the Pentagon. Even as the Pentagon
receives many billions more dollars, it doesn't want to submit all of
the reports needed for congressional (read: civilian) oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Esther Schrader reported this week that
administration officials say the Pentagon is the tip of the spear in
the movement to relieve executive branch agencies of oversight
considered unnecessary and burdensome. But the requirements did not
spring up out of thin air.</TE>
<TE>   Congress needs to monitor the executive branch, especially with an
agency as powerful as the Defense Department. Civilian control of the
military is one of the fundamental principles of this country. With a
military budget of nearly $400 billion this year, the Pentagon needs
more scrutiny than ever.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say it doesn't make sense to get rid of busywork.
Congress has expressed a willingness to listen to the Defense
Department's concerns and has agreed to eliminate 20 of the more than
300 reports required each year.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pentagon should not receive blanket exemptions from
environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and the Endangered
Species Act. Military officials argue that the restrictions make it
difficult to find sites needed to train, a critical requirement. Yet
giving the military a pass when it comes to the environment is too
high a price. American military successes in Afghanistan are evidence
that the nation can field excellent fighting forces without
circumventing the laws designed to keep air breathable and soil
clean.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terrorism has increased Rumsfeld's profile and power.
It should not be an excuse to do away with needed regulations and
oversight of a massive, powerful bureaucracy.</TE>

<LD>This just in: Morocco has invaded Europe. Of all this planet's
potential conflicts, Morocco snatching a piece of Spain was not
widely expected. But in recent days a crack team of 11 armed
Moroccans with tents and a flag claimed a rocklet in the Strait of
Gibraltar. Spain says it's Spanish. Que si! Que no!</LD>
<LD>   Spain calls the stadium-size outcropping Isla de Perejil, which
means Parsley Island, and Morocco calls it Leila, which means Leila.</LD>
<LD>   Spain hadn't done much with the rock. Nonetheless, backed by the
European Union, it dispatched gunboats. Morocco, backed by the Arab
League, says it needs the island to combat terrorism and illegal
immigration. Now, except for lizards, insects and, of course, wild
parsley and a few armed Moroccans, Parsley Island is uninhabited. So
its prominence as a target for terrorists or fleeing masses had been
overlooked.</LD>
<TE>   The world is spotted with such minor geographic and political
anomalies, often military prizes, outposts and fueling stations from
long-ago conflicts and their ensuing treaties. The United States got
Guam from Spain and kept it; recall "Guam-based B-52s" from Vietnam
War reports? Britain and Portugal ceded Hong Kong and Macao back to
China. France still owns St. Pierre and Miquelon just off Canada's
Newfoundland. And, of course, right by Spain there's a large
Mediterranean rock called Gibraltar, which is not owned by Prudential
Insurance and has as much to do with its British owners
geographically as salsa. These places make intriguing travel pieces
for Sunday newspapers and those E! Entertainment segments--"Wild on
Parsley Island!"</TE>
<TE>   This thankfully nonviolent face-off also provides a summer
diversion to tide us over till next month's spate of shark-attack
stories.</TE>
<TE>   Spain and Morocco have long-standing territorial grudges but had
made real progress talking, especially recently as the population of
Moroccan immigrant workers in Spain reached a quarter-million. Maybe
former President Carter needs a break from not solving the troubles
of other nations to squeeze in some down-home mediation over
Leila-Parsley Island. If Morocco and Spain are lucky, Carter will get
there before Al Sharpton.</TE>

<HD>Afghans Seek Aid to Cover Budget Gap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The government appealed Tuesday for international help to cover a
budget deficit of nearly $260 million, promising not to print money
or borrow to cover the shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Finance Minister Ashref Ghani said the government had set an
operating budget of $460.3 million for fiscal 2002-03 but expects
domestic revenue of only $83 million. With $22.5 million in public
sector pay arrears to cover as well, he said, promised grants of just
over $140 million were not enough.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a substantial shortfall," Ghani said at a news
conference in Kabul, the capital, "but we have a determination not to
print money ... and a consensus not to borrow."</LD>
<TE>   The operating budget covers the cost of running the government and
the civil service.</TE>
<TE>   International donors have pledged hundreds of millions more in
aid, grants and loans, but most of that is linked to development
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Of the approximately $140 million pledged for the operating
budget, $100 million is from the World Bank and $20 million is from
the United States. India and Pakistan each pledged $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Ghani said the government was making progress in collecting
revenue, citing deliveries of more than $200,000 from provincial
capitals in the last few days. In the past, provincial warlords
treated revenue collected in their fiefdoms as their own.</TE>
<TE>   The Finance Ministry, where Ghani held his news conference,
mirrors the state of the economy--paint peeling off walls, broken
windows, doors hanging from hinges and rooms packed floor to ceiling
with dusty files.</TE>
<TE>   However, in the same way workers were feverishly making repairs to
the ministry Tuesday, the government is trying to knock the economy
back into shape, Ghani said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a tremendous amount of invisible work going on at the
moment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was "premature" to say when the Afghan currency, the
afghani, might be replaced, although other officials have said it is
only a matter of time.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have little idea how many afghanis--trading now at about
40,000 to the dollar--are in circulation because previous governments
printed more any time they needed to pay salaries.</TE>

<LD>   Belgian banks signed an agreement to pay about $54 million in
compensation to the country's Jews for property lost during the Nazi
occupation.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement was signed at the Finance Ministry after long
negotiations between the Belgian Bank Assn. and Jewish
representatives. It follows a similar commitment by the government
and insurance companies to pay $57 million to compensate for property
plundered or abandoned during the 1940-45 occupation.</TE>
<TE>   "There were thousands of victims that never recovered the property
of their families," said David Susskind, a representative of

<HD>Chirac Attack Reportedly Foretold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The man accused of trying to assassinate French President Jacques
Chirac on Sunday had discussed his plans with fellow members of an
extreme-right group and on an Internet site, news reports said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Watch the Tv This Sunday, i will be the star.... Death to
zog,88," read a message posted on the extremist Combat 18 Internet
site, signed "Maxime."</LD>
<LD>   The message was dated July 13, the day before Maxime Brunerie, 25,
allegedly pulled a .22-caliber rifle from a guitar case and fired as
Chirac passed by during a Bastille Day parade. At least one spectator
turned the rifle barrel aside and others helped wrestle Brunerie to
the ground.</LD>
<TE>   Brunerie also spoke about his plans with a couple close to one
radical rightist group and a friend in a student extreme-right group,
Le Figaro and other newspapers reported. All three told police that
they did not take Brunerie seriously, Le Figaro said.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial officials decided Monday that Brunerie was unfit for
questioning and would remain at a psychiatric hospital for at least a
month. However, the Internet message may become evidence against him
if psychiatrists conclude that he acted with premeditation when he
fired the shot.</TE>
<TE>   Brunerie's message was posted on the Web site of the British
neo-Nazi group Combat 18.</TE>
<TE>   The number 18 represents the first and eighth letters of the
alphabet, A and H, for Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   The "Death to zog,88" is also neo-Nazi code.</TE>
<TE>   "Zog" stands for Zionist occupied government, reflecting the
neo-Nazi view that Jews control "most of the White nations on this
planet," as the Combat 18 Web site explains.</TE>
<TE>   The number 88 represents "HH," for "Heil Hitler."</TE>
<TE>   The Web site carried several news reports Tuesday about the
assassination bid and messages supporting Brunerie.</TE>

<HD>Drawdown Reported in India</HD>
<DH>Asia: Officials say 18,000 troops were pulled from border
with Pakistan. Government denies it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAMMU, India</DL>
<LD>In what could be a significant reduction of war readiness, the Indian
army has withdrawn three strike divisions--about 18,000 men--from the
Pakistan frontier, high-ranking army and government officials said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Ministry denied the movements, however, and India's
deputy prime minister made a bellicose speech to Parliament, claiming
the nation's right to all of the disputed region of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   The mixed signals were indicative of the political sensitivity of
de-escalation and the tough task awaiting Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw when they visit India
and Pakistan this month to nudge them toward dialogue.</LD>
<TE>   The army withdrew the three divisions a week ago, before an attack
Saturday by suspected Islamic militants that killed 28 people in
India's northern Jammu and Kashmir state, the officials in Jammu said
on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The strike divisions--units that are trained to push forward in
case of war or make cross-border attacks on militants--were removed
after a study confirmed that the infiltration of militants from
Pakistani territory had significantly diminished, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In New Delhi, the Defense Ministry denied the report. "There is no
change in the deployment level of the Indian army, including the
strike formations," it said.</TE>
<TE>   The officials, who have given reliable information about such
movements in the past, said the government had not planned to make
its troop withdrawal public.</TE>
<TE>   A strike division has about 6,000 soldiers, meaning that the
withdrawal reported by the officers and officials could involve about
18,000 battle-ready troops.</TE>
<TE>   In Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, government spokesman Maj.
Gen. Rashid Qureshi said he had no confirmation of the Indian
withdrawal and therefore could make no comment.</TE>

<HD>IRA Offers a Sweeping Apology</HD>
<DH>Northern Ireland: Militant group says it regrets killing
civilians. Britain welcomes the gesture, but unionists call it
inadequate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Nearly 30 years after the Irish Republican Army's "Bloody Friday"
bombings left nine people dead, the paramilitary group issued a
sweeping apology Tuesday for killing and injuring civilians during
its long campaign of violence against British rule.</LD>
<LD>   Although dismissed as inadequate by unionists, the IRA
leadership's statement was welcomed by the British government, which
urged the republican group to turn its sentiments into reality.</LD>
<LD>   Coming after complaints from unionists that confidence in the
peace process was leaking away, the apology is seen by Britain as an
important step.</LD>
<TE>   On July 21, 1972--"Bloody Friday"--the IRA exploded more than 30
bombs in Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland. Nine people were
killed and more than 100 were injured.</TE>
<TE>   "While it was not our intention to injure or kill noncombatants,
the reality is that on this and on a number of other occasions, that
was the consequence of our actions," the IRA statement said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is, therefore, appropriate on the anniversary of this tragic
event that we address all of the deaths and injuries of noncombatants
caused by us," it said. "We offer our sincere apologies and
condolences to their families."</TE>
<TE>   The peace process involves acceptance of past mistakes and of the
hurt and pain the organization had caused people, the statement
added.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,600 people have died in Northern Ireland's strife. More
than half of those deaths are attributed to the IRA and other
paramilitary groups that oppose the province's union with Britain.</TE>
<TE>   The IRA apology comes eight years after a similar apology by
loyalist paramilitary forces, which supported ties with Britain. The
IRA statement is expected to do little to mollify unionists who
accuse the group of breaching a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   But it is important as the IRA's first clear and sweeping
acknowledgment of the wrongs it committed, offering a signal of its
commitment to the peace process. The IRA has expressed regret for
individual acts of violence but never issued a broad apology for all
the civilian deaths it caused.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the apology, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
the IRA "has never been further away from a resumption of violence."</TE>
<TE>   Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid said the important thing is
to translate the IRA sentiments into reality.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an apology of unprecedented strength, an acknowledgment of
the terrible, terrible pain that was caused throughout the years of
conflict, particularly to civilians, but also wider than that," Reid
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the best way to acknowledge the past pain is to make sure the
people of Northern Ireland have the confidence that events like this
will never happen again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Loyalist spokesmen dismissed the apology as "too little too late"
and "words, words, words."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Donaldson, a member of the Ulster Unionist Party who is
opposed to the peace deal, said the apology is inadequate and
belated.</TE>
<TE>   "This statement comes very late in the day. It doesn't go far
enough, because we need to know no more innocent people will die at
the hands of the IRA," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Ireland's peace process has been severely tested in
recent months, with outbreaks of sectarian violence and accusations
from Protestants that the IRA was breaching the cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Blair has promised to announce steps to strengthen or enforce the
cease-fire in the next week, after David Trimble, first minister in
Northern Ireland's power-sharing government and the leader of the
Ulster Unionists, demanded tougher action.</TE>
<TE>   Trimble warned that his administration would fall apart unless
Britain took firm action.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, the IRA has started decommissioning its
illegal arsenal of weapons. But unionists accuse the republican
guerrillas of testing new weapons in Colombia, claims that the group
has denied.</TE>
<TE>   In its statement, the IRA said the future would not be found in
"denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts
to the plight of those who had been hurt. That includes all victims
of the conflict, combatants and noncombatants."</TE>
<TE>   It said the peace process required that both sides acknowledge the
losses of others.</TE>
<TE>   The apology comes after the peak of Northern Ireland's highly
charged marching season, when unionists parade to commemorate past
Protestant victories over Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   In previous years, riots often erupted when the marches passed
through Catholic areas.</TE>
<TE>   Despite tensions in the peace process, the violence this summer
was largely contained.</TE>
<TE>   On July 12, traditionally the tensest day, police praised IRA
leaders for helping defuse violence by sending out people to urge
Catholic protesters not to throw rocks and gasoline bombs.</TE>

<HD>Spain Ousts Moroccans From Island</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Spain said today that it had removed by force the Moroccan troops who
had set up an observation post last week on a disputed island off
Morocco's Mediterranean coast.</LD>
<LD>   Spain said in a statement that the operation to remove the
Moroccans had been carried out without any injuries to either side.
It said it had informed its allies of the move.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Spain deployed a fifth warship to waters near the
island, the Spanish defense minister said.</LD>
<TE>   But Spanish and Moroccan officials said they both wanted a
diplomatic solution to the standoff, and Madrid recalled its
ambassador for consultations.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Defense Minister Federico Trillo told reporters that the
frigate Castilla would arrive today in Ceuta, a Spanish enclave in
North Africa four miles from the island, which is known as Isla del
Perejil to Spaniards and Leila to Moroccans.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Castilla would join four other warships patrolling
waters off the North African coast.</TE>
<TE>   A unit of Moroccan troops landed on the island Thursday, a
deployment Morocco said was part of its effort to combat drug
trafficking and illegal immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Locals say a cave on the island is used as a drop-off point by
drug runners, and both Spanish and Moroccan police have chased
suspected criminals there.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, four Moroccan soldiers could be seen from the mainland
collecting supplies from a dinghy that came from a Moroccan navy
ship.</TE>
<TE>   Two small Moroccan flags flew above the island.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish claims over the tiny island date to the 17th century.</TE>
<TE>   But there has been no Spanish presence there for the last 40

<HD>For Some in Mexico, Property Is Worth a Life</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Land means food, freedom, everything, says a man
injured in the recent standoff between farmers and the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN SALVADOR ATENCO, Mexico</DL>
<LD>With his land smack-dab in the footprint of a planned Mexico City
airport, Ignacio Yanez vowed Tuesday to defend his five acres with
his life. And he put it on the line last week as he and 30 other
farmers clashed with state police at a roadblock.</LD>
<LD>   The battle, Yanez's severe injuries and the arrest of farmers set
off a four-day community rebellion that is forcing the federal
government to rethink plans to build a $2.3-billion airport here to
replace the capital's overcrowded transportation hub.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing worth fighting for is free," Yanez said, his left arm in
a cast as he stood amid corn and squash on acreage originally given
to his great-grandfather by the government after the Mexican
Revolution nearly a century ago. "The land is our mother who feeds
us, gives us liberty and tranquillity, without which we are nobody.</LD>
<TE>   "It is not negotiable at any price," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marching with his neighbors, Yanez was trying to make that point
to Gov. Arturo Montiel of Mexico state last Thursday. The marchers
had hoped to confront the governor at a speaking engagement in
Acolman, about 10 miles up the road from here, but police blocked
their way. A melee ensued in which a dozen farmers were arrested.
Five of them, including Yanez, were hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the clash got back to San Salvador Atenco, and within
hours farmers had blockaded roads and taken hostages. A tense
standoff with 900 police officers who ringed the town threatened to
become a pitched battle. Residents hijacked propane-gas tankers and
threatened to blow them up if the authorities moved in.</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation ended peacefully Monday when the government
released Yanez and the other prisoners and farmers released their 19
hostages.</TE>
<TE>   The clash underscores the farmers' deep attachment to--and
dependence on--the land.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything people in rural Mexico have is wrapped up in the
land," said John Womack, a history professor at Harvard University
who has written extensively about Mexico. "It's the equivalent of
their pension plans, their life insurance policies, their workers'
compensation and their daily livelihoods. So both for the community
and the social insurance it gives them, they are going to fight as
long and as hard as they can to keep it."</TE>
<TE>   Until the clash, Yanez and other farmers had a hard time being
taken seriously, despite the increasingly violent tenor of their
protests, including their brandishing of machetes. It was the 12th
time Yanez had marched since October, when the government chose his
neighborhood as the site of the six-runway airport, a huge public
works project that will take six years to build.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the confrontation, President Vicente Fox told
CNN on Monday night that other sites for the airport would be
studied.</TE>
<TE>   While critics accused the government of caving in to lawlessness,
the 48-year-old Yanez emerged as a local hero. He paid a price,
returning from jail with a concussion, a head gash, a broken wrist,
his neck out of joint and a summons to appear in court this morning
to face riot charges. Others in town have suffered economic losses as
commerce has come to a standstill.</TE>
<TE>   "The police blocked our way and interfered with our legal rights.
And so we started to fight, to defend ourselves," said Yanez, a
father of five. "We threw rocks; they threw them back and beat us
with sticks. The tear gas weakened me; I fell and they were on top of
me. I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Fox's comments and Yanez's optimism that farmers had
defeated the proposed airport, the fight is still unresolved. No
meetings between the government and farmers have been scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the government has been firm about its intention to
expropriate about 13,000 acres, including about 2,600 acres in San
Salvador Atenco, for the airport.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Fox government ends up deeming the political cost of an
airport here too great, the clash Thursday on the road to Acolman
undoubtedly will be the farmers' Bunker Hill, a lost battle that
inspired their forces to eventual victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone poor in Mexico who takes on the government, especially in
the state of Mexico, knows very well you don't get very far with the
authorities unless you're willing to get the hell beat out of
yourself," Womack said. "If you are fighting for all you've got in
the world, people are prepared to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The Yanez family lives on the crops--corn, squash, alfalfa and
beans--grown on their five acres and on the proceeds from a tiny
store they operate adjacent to their modest home. They are among
1,500 landowners in Atenco.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to change our lives. We are happy where we are,"
said Yanez's wife, Maria Concepcion. "It's not a great thing, but we
live well and it's quiet."</TE>
<TE>   There is deep-seated mistrust here of the government ever coming
across with even the small amount of money it has offered for the
land, said merchant Carmelo Rojas.</TE>
<TE>   "The state took an easement from me 15 years ago to build a new
road, and I am still waiting for the miserable few pesos they
promised me," Rojas said. "People in the government always take
advantage of the poor because we don't have the resources to confront
them."</TE>
<TE>   Many observers say the farmers are merely angling for a better
price than the 70 cents per square meter the government has offered.
But the commitment of farmers like Yanez to stay on the land seems
sincere, as does their promise not to shrink from violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The land is a legacy for our children, and it will give me pride
to give it to them, just as my father gave it to me," Yanez said.
"Money runs out, but the land endures."</TE>
<TE>   Anthropology researcher Ruben Lechuga of Iberoamericana University
in Mexico City said the mood among farmers has become more militant
since last week.</TE>
<TE>   Said Maria Concepcion Yanez: "The government wants to blind us
with the glitter of the city that we'll be better off without the
land and with development. But the truth is we're not going to let
them take it from us."</TE>

<HD>7 Slain as Gunmen Ambush Israeli Bus in the West Bank</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Three groups claim responsibility. A shootout
today may have killed one assailant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EMMANUEL, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Palestinian gunmen dressed as Israeli soldiers ambushed an armored
bus near the entrance to this Jewish settlement Tuesday, disabling
the vehicle with a roadside bomb before climbing onto the roof and
firing inside, killing seven people, including an infant.</LD>
<LD>   Among the dead, hospital officials said, were three members of the
same family: a woman, her son-in-law and his 9-month-old daughter.
The dead man's wife, their 2-year-old son and the dead infant's twin
were among at least 17 people injured in the ambush, the first fatal
attack on Israeli civilians since June 20.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors reportedly were fighting Tuesday night to save the lives
of a gravely injured woman and her baby, whom they were forced to
deliver prematurely by caesarean section. The child was born without
a pulse; doctors briefly restored the pulse but the infant did not
survive, Israel Television reported today.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli troops descended on the scene of the attack within
minutes, but the gunmen escaped across the rocky, terraced hilltops
that surround this ultra-Orthodox settlement in the northern West
Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, the army reported that its troops were engaged in a
shootout near the settlement with gunmen who the military believed
had carried out the attack. One gunman was shot dead and an Israeli
also was killed, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   Three Palestinian organizations, including a militia of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed
responsibility for the killings, although his Palestinian Authority
condemned the attack. The Israeli government blamed Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The ambush came as diplomats from the United States, Russia, the
European Union and the United Nations conferred in New York on ways
to put an end to Israeli-Palestinian violence and revive moribund
peacemaking efforts. The Bush administration quickly condemned the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   The day's violence "is another reminder of why it is so important,
in the president's judgment, for all the parties in the Middle East
to do their utmost to focus on peace, to stop the terrorism that is
plaguing the people of Israel, and to take every action possible to
bring peace to the region," White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer
told reporters in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The carefully planned assault virtually duplicated one outside the
same settlement Dec. 12 in which 10 Israelis were killed. Israel
severed all contact with Arafat after the earlier ambush and hunted
down militants across the West Bank. This time, however, it was
unclear what, if any, retaliation the government would launch.</TE>
<TE>   Israel reoccupied much of the West Bank last month after 26
Israelis were killed in back-to-back bombings in Jerusalem. Soldiers
remain in control of seven of the eight major Palestinian cities.
Hundreds of thousands of residents have been confined to their homes
for weeks, with only a few hours' respite every few days to buy
groceries. Troops have been rounding up militants, confiscating
weapons and destroying explosives laboratories round the clock for
three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But about 3 p.m. Tuesday, an explosion rocked bus No. 189 as it
approached the entrance to Emmanuel on its regular run from Bnei
Brak, an ultra-Orthodox suburb of Tel Aviv. Although the bus was
armored, the force of the blast knocked it off the road and blew a
crater into a rocky hillside.</TE>
<TE>   At least three gunmen then attacked the bus and a truck that had
been driving close to it. The army said the gunmen appeared to have
camped out overnight near the site.</TE>
<TE>   The radical Islamic movement Hamas claimed responsibility, as did
the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade of the Fatah movement and the leftist
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   International human rights organizations have condemned such
attacks as war crimes perpetrated on civilians. However, Palestinian
militant groups consider Jewish settlers legitimate targets, arguing
that they are living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in contravention
of international law.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority--which usually reserves its statements
of condemnation for attacks carried out inside the borders of
pre-1967 Israel--said it "condemns the attack in accordance with its
policies that reject targeting civilians, Israelis or Palestinians."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors said the gunmen threw grenades into the bus and opened
fire through the unarmored roof and tiny windows close to the roof
that were not bulletproofed.</TE>
<TE>   "At least two terrorists climbed the roof of the bus and started
shooting from above in all directions," said Natalia Pollack, who is
nine months pregnant. She was riding the bus to her home in Emmanuel
when the attack occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone on board lay on the floor," said Pollack, who was
lightly injured by shrapnel. Many of the passengers recited psalms as
they waited for rescue, she and other survivors said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid that all of us would die," said Uriel Litvak, 18,
another Emmanuel resident on the bus. He told the Israeli Internet
news service Y-net that the passengers could not escape because the
bus' doors were jammed.</TE>
<TE>   Hodaya Hayun, 17, who had been riding with her 15-year-old sister,
Ruhama, said her family had already decided to leave Emmanuel
"because of the situation." She was lightly injured and her sister
escaped harm, but they will certainly move, she said, by the end of
the month.</TE>
<TE>   Standing with a bloodied bandage wrapped around her forehead,
Hodaya recounted how she was handed a baby, "naked and white, covered
in blood," as she got off the bus after help arrived. "I thought it
was dead," she related calmly. "Then someone wetted her lips, and she
started to cry. We covered her."</TE>
<TE>   Hodaya did not know what became of the infant.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters near the bus three hours after the ambush,
Israeli army Brig. Gen. Gershon Yitzhak said it was impossible to
thwart every attack. "We can see through this attack the complexity
of fighting the Palestinian terror," he said. "While we are obliged
to be strong at every place and at every hour, they need be strong
only in the place they attack," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on Israel Television, Communications Minister Reuven
Rivlin said the situation would be worse if troops had not reoccupied
Palestinian towns.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine what would have happened if we had not been in the West
Bank areas, catching people prepared to kill us on buses and
kindergartens every day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Yossi Sarid, leader of the left-wing opposition in the Israeli
parliament, warned that the government's open-ended reoccupation of
cities and imposition of long curfews are causing such distress among
Palestinians that "Israel should prepare for a third popular intifada
on the part of the hungry, suffering and poor masses."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres postponed a meeting scheduled for
today between a team of Israelis he heads and Arafat's
administration. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon recently appointed the
Israeli team to negotiate humanitarian issues with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides were supposed to discuss ways of improving the
day-to-day lives of the 800,000 Palestinians living under Israeli
military curfews and blockades. But Peres, speaking on Israel
Television's "Politica" program Tuesday night, said he still intends
to hold the discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't give up negotiation," he said. "It is wise to continue
talking even when there is shooting."</TE>
<TE>   He postponed the meeting, Peres said, "because funerals will be
held tomorrow and I do not want to hold meetings at such an hour--we
are all filled with pain."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Robin Wright in Washington contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Spain Arrests Terror Suspect, Citing Videos</HD>
<DH>Europe: News of the footage he allegedly shot of the World
Trade Center and other sites prompts California to boost security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Spanish police on Tuesday arrested a suspected member of an Al Qaeda
cell in Madrid who allegedly took extensive videos of the World Trade
Center, the Golden Gate Bridge and other potential targets during a
terrorist reconnaissance mission in 1997. Alerted by the FBI,
California officials beefed up security statewide.</LD>
<LD>   The five videos, which were discovered recently, raised suspicions
among Spanish police because the footage is much longer and more
detailed than a typical tourist video. Comments that the suspect made
during the recording led police to believe that he might have been a
scout for terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   A Bush administration official familiar with the operations of Al
Qaeda said in Washington that the videos confirmed long-held fears
that Osama bin Laden's terrorist network had looked into targeting
other landmarks besides the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes he describes things, but at other moments he refers to
someone else who will take a closer look at something," said a
Spanish law enforcement official who viewed the tapes. "He gives the
impression that he is part of an operation. Some of the sites are
tourist attractions, but the amount of time doesn't make sense for a
tourist--every conceivable angle, inside and out, close up and far
away. It is definitely suspicious."</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, 37-year-old Ghasoub Abrash Ghalyoun, dedicated two
full cassettes to the World Trade Center, filming exteriors and
interiors, the official said. Abrash's video of the Golden Gate
Bridge paid particular attention to the support structure, according
to investigators. The videos show other landmarks that have been the
subject of terrorism alerts: the Brooklyn Bridge, Sears Tower in
Chicago and the Statue of Liberty, as well as a still-unidentified
New York airport, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Abrash, a Syrian-born Spanish citizen, allegedly belonged to a
Madrid terrorist cell that Spanish officials say played a support
role in the Sept. 11 attacks. He traveled to the United States after
sending his family on a trip to Syria, the law enforcement official
said. Spanish police will work with U.S. agents to identify other men
who appear in the videos, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Four months after he returned from the United States, Abrash
allegedly met with a courier of Bin Laden in the Spanish
Mediterranean coastal town of Castellon, a senior Spanish law
enforcement official said, further bolstering the theory that Abrash
was on a scouting mission for a possible attack.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe that copies of the videos were handed over to the
alleged courier, Mohammed Bahaiah, the senior official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The suspicion is that videos were given to the courier and that
the intended recipient could have been Bin Laden in Afghanistan," the
senior law enforcement official said. "Now the suspects have to be
interrogated and explain the reason for the videos, all the question
marks and dark areas of this matter."</TE>
<TE>   Bahaiah, also known as Abu Khaled, is a fugitive, according to
authorities. Before Sept. 11, he lived in Turkey and traveled between
Afghanistan and Europe as an emissary of Bin Laden, according to
Spanish court documents.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration official said advance scouting is part of
a tried-and-true method Al Qaeda has used to conduct surveillance on
a target years before an attack.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very meticulous and careful in their planning," said the
U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The general
premise of their operational planning cycle is two to three years
from the identification of the target to the development of the
operational terror cell and its training, the placement of the cell
in the country and then the preparation for the attack, which can
take months."</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the 1997 videos is consistent with the theory that
Abrash was a scout for a plot that produced the Sept. 11 attacks, the
Spanish police official said, adding that the amount of time it took
to develop the Sept. 11 plot would be similar to the lead time for
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Al
Qaeda operatives first arrived in Kenya in 1993, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear when police first viewed Abrash's videos, which
were among material seized in April when he was arrested and briefly
detained. During that operation, police charged Mohammed Galeb Kalaje
Zouaydi, his sometime business partner in real estate and
construction ventures, with funneling hundreds of thousands of
dollars to terrorists in Western Europe, the Middle East, the Balkans
and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Besides being the cell's alleged financier, Zouaydi is also the
brother-in-law of the alleged courier, Bahaiah. On Tuesday, police
arrested two other suspects, including Mohammed Khair, a Syrian
businessman who lives in Castellon and is also accused of attending
the meeting with the courier.</TE>
<TE>   The case was launched in November when police dismantled what they
believed to be a major cell in Madrid with ties to top Al Qaeda
figures. Judge Baltasar Garzon accused a dozen suspects, most of them
Syrian immigrants, of being accomplices in the Sept. 11 attacks. He
based the charges on telephone numbers, travels, money transfers and
other links to suspected Sept. 11 plotters.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, police are still investigating a suspected planning
session held in Spain in July 2001 by alleged lead hijacker Mohamed
Atta and Ramzi Binalshibh, an accused Hamburg-based accomplice.</TE>
<TE>   In California, authorities throughout the state mobilized rapidly
Tuesday in response to the perceived threat revealed in the videos.
George Vinson, chief security advisor to Gov. Gray Davis, said he got
word of the arrests in Spain and the contents of the videotapes
Tuesday morning in calls from FBI officials.</TE>
<TE>   The Highway Patrol, whose officers have been on high alert since
Sept. 11, ordered security stepped up statewide, including extra
aircraft patrols of the electricity grid, the California Aqueduct,
reservoirs and nuclear power plants.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no threat of anything imminent, but we are taking this
thing seriously," said CHP Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick.</TE>
<TE>   He refused to say how many extra officers were mobilized but said
the force was "significant." In addition to surveillance from nearly
three dozen airplanes, more officers were added to guard the Golden
Gate and other key bridges, including the Bay Bridge, the Vincent
Thomas Memorial Bridge in San Pedro and the Coronado Bridge in San

<HD>Arafat Issue Aside, 'Quartet' Finds Unity</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Officials from Europe and key Arab states shun
U.S. calls to oust Palestinian leader but otherwise back Bush's
reform initiative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>After meetings with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell here Tuesday,
top diplomats from Europe, Russia and key Arab states pointedly
distanced themselves from U.S. efforts to dislodge Yasser Arafat from
power, saying Palestinians should choose their own leaders without
foreign interference.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the high-level diplomatic discussions of President Bush's new
Middle East initiative produced broad support for U.S. insistence on
Palestinian political and economic reform as a prerequisite for
peace--provided that Israel takes "reciprocal steps" toward an end to
its military occupation of areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   The group of intermediaries, which has been dubbed "the
quartet"--the United States, the United Nations, the European Union
and Russia--called on Palestinians "to create a governing framework
of working democracy, in preparation for statehood," including "free,
open and democratic elections."</LD>
<TE>   Powell said the U.S. was working with Arab and European officials
on undisclosed new security steps by the Palestinians, though he
denied reports that CIA Director George J. Tenet would travel to the
region this month to implement the plans.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the group called on Israel "to take concrete
steps to support the emergence of a viable Palestinian state," such
as removing the military roadblocks outside most Palestinian towns
and pulling troops back to where they were before the outbreak of
violence in the region in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "There can be no military solution to this conflict," said U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, speaking on behalf of the group. "The
Israeli occupation that began in 1967 must end, and Israel must have
secure, recognized borders." He referred in part to areas seized by
Israel during the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Israel should also stop "all new settlement activity," the group
said, and release what U.S. officials said is more than $600 million
in tax money meant for the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Israel stopped turning over sales taxes and customs
duties it collected for the Palestinian Authority under the terms of
the 1993 Oslo peace accords, contending that the funds indirectly
subsidized Palestinian terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The foreign ministers of Jordan and Egypt, who met separately with
Powell and then later with representatives of the entire quartet for
dinner at Annan's Manhattan townhouse, welcomed what they saw as a
renewed U.S. commitment to achieving a resolution in the region.</TE>
<TE>   They were especially encouraged, they said, by Bush's stated goal
of achieving a settlement with an independent Palestinian state
within three years.</TE>
<TE>   As with so many of the recent diplomatic initiatives in the
region, Tuesday's high-level discussions were overshadowed by renewed
Mideast violence, with the diplomats here decrying an ambush by
Palestinian militants in the West Bank that claimed the lives of
seven Israelis and wounded at least 17 others.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists must not be allowed to kill the hope of an entire
region, and a united international community, for genuine peace and
security for both Palestinians and Israelis," the quartet said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Though Powell stressed in his private meetings here the importance
of renewing ground-level security cooperation between Israel and the
Palestinians, some European diplomats suggested that this
collaboration would be difficult without Arafat's direct involvement
and support.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat "is the legitimately elected leader of Palestine, and while
he is in this capacity, we will continue to maintain our relations
with him," Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials suggested that they could deal directly with
what they called "empowered ministers" in Arafat's recently
reorganized Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Going into Tuesday's meetings, Powell and his colleagues had
already seemingly agreed to disagree on the issue of Arafat's
leadership. They avoided the topic almost entirely in the meetings
here, according to diplomats who attended the sessions, and
concentrated instead on areas of broad accord, including the urgent
need to relieve what one senior U.S. diplomat called the
Palestinians' "truly horrific" living conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Annan, in what was seen as an effort to show that Israel had been
consulted about the discussions, told reporters that he had spoken
with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon by telephone shortly before
Tuesday's meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "Prime Minister Sharon told me that he wanted to see a worldwide
humanitarian operation to alleviate the plight of the Palestinian
people," Annan said. "Of course, we shall have to find out more
details about that."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, officials and economic assistance experts representing
the quartet and Norway and Japan--two other major donors of aid to
the Palestinians--met in London to coordinate aid disbursement and
Palestinian reform plans.</TE>
<TE>   But European officials rebuffed U.S. suggestions that all aid to
the Palestinians be disbursed through nongovernmental channels, as
has been the case with American assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Palestinian Authority's creation eight years ago,
congressional strictures have banned direct U.S. aid to Arafat's
semiautonomous government.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. provides about $142 million a year to the Palestinians,
mostly in grants for private charities, water projects and the U.N.
refugee agency.</TE>
<TE>   European donors estimate they are providing about double that
amount, most of which has gone directly to schools, hospitals and
nongovernmental programs.</TE>
<TE>   But last year, after Israel's seizure of the tax revenues that
were the Palestinian Authority's main source of income, the Europeans
increased their budgetary assistance to help make up for the
shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia and the other Persian Gulf oil states also began
providing direct budgetary support to the Palestinians for the first
time, under a plan supervised by the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I want to tell you is that the donor community
resources that go to the Palestinian Authority, including from the
European Union, have more controls than those of any other donor
community contributing to any country in the world," Javier Solana,
the European Union's foreign policy chief, said in response to a
question about European aid Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Turmoil in Turkey Deflects Focus From Iraq</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Local politics trumps U.S. official's visit, as
premier agrees to early elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>As a top U.S. defense official held talks here on a possible military
strike against Iraq, such planning was complicated Tuesday when the
political parties in the rapidly unraveling government of Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit agreed to hold early elections.</LD>
<LD>   The ailing Ecevit had fiercely resisted calls to move
parliamentary elections up from 2004 to November, but his hand was
forced when further defections from his party reduced the government
to controlling half the seats in parliament.</LD>
<LD>   The political turmoil means that in the coming months it will be
difficult for Turkish leaders to focus on a possible military
conflict with neighboring Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz met with Ecevit and
Turkish military brass for talks believed to have centered on a
proposed U.S.-led effort to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Any such action would carry enormous risks for Turkey. But if
successful, it could bring long-term economic and political benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkey has very large and legitimate interests in Iraq,"
Wolfowitz said after meeting with Ecevit. "The United States has a
very large concern for Turkey's success. So it matters greatly to us
what the Turkish perspective and views are."</TE>
<TE>   Political uncertainty is so great here that it is difficult to
know whether the next Turkish government would support a U.S.-led
effort against Iraq, which Washington says is developing weapons of
mass destruction. Turkey's participation is seen as crucial in part
because the nation would be expected to provide use of its air bases.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz also met with Defense Minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu and
other top military officials, who in the Turkish system would have a
strong voice on security decisions regardless of who is elected prime
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Cakmakoglu said Monday that Turkey did not "at this moment"
approve of any U.S. attack on Iraq. "We respect Iraq's territorial
integrity, political unity and sovereignty," state-run TRT television
quoted him as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Its
air bases are used by the U.S. and Britain to patrol a "no-fly" zone
over northern Iraq where Hussein's air force is not allowed to fly.
The zone was established to protect ethnic Kurds in northern Iraq,
who hold an area free from Iraqi government control.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush last week renewed his administration's commitment
to ousting the Hussein regime, declaring he would use "all the tools"
at his disposal. But he left open the prospect that something short
of a second Persian Gulf War could achieve that goal.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comments followed recent news leaks about a developing
Pentagon plan for 250,000 U.S. troops to attack Iraq on three fronts.
Defense officials and military analysts have cautioned that the plan
is only one of perhaps a dozen circulating in the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz was joined at the talks here by Marc Grossman, a
high-ranking State Department official who met recently with exiled
Iraqi opposition leaders, and Air Force Gen. Joseph W. Ralston,
NATO's supreme commander.</TE>
<TE>   Any effort to oust Hussein is unlikely this year, analysts say,
because the predominantly Muslim nations that the administration
wants in a coalition against Iraq are preoccupied by the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and U.S. soldiers remain embroiled in
Afghanistan. If an attack is launched next year, a new Turkish
government could be in place soon enough to join in the planning.</TE>
<TE>   Ecevit has expressed opposition to such an offensive, arguing that
another war would have a devastating effect on the economy of Turkey,
which is locked in its worst recession since 1945.</TE>
<TE>   But some politicians here are willing to risk a battle with Iraq.
Tansu Ciller, head of the opposition True Path Party, said recently,
"I want to be the premier during a possible military action against
Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   In any such conflict, Turkey would risk retaliation from its
neighbor. In addition, if the campaign is successful, it could lead
to greater autonomy, perhaps even independence, for the Kurdish
population of northern Iraq. That region borders a part of Turkey
that has a large Kurdish minority, and the government here fears that
Turkish Kurds could be incited to make greater demands.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz sought to allay those fears Tuesday. "We've been very
clear ... expressing our firm opposition to a Kurdish state in
northern Iraq," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to hold early elections followed a stream of
defections from Ecevit's Party of the Democratic Left.</TE>
<TE>   Ecevit, 77, has suffered a range of ailments in recent months,
including spinal problems and a cracked rib. He has been hospitalized
several times and often has been unable to go to his office,
prompting calls for his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Ecevit and his coalition partners--Devlet Bahceli, head of the
Nationalist Action Party, and Mesut Yilmaz of the Motherland
Party--met Tuesday and then issued a statement saying the three
leaders had agreed to hold a general election Nov. 3.</TE>

<HD>Attempt to Smuggle 1,500 Turtles Is Foiled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>More than 1,500 Indonesian turtles bound for China--including the
terrapin, an endangered species--were found during a routine search
at Jakarta's international airport, customs officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The live turtles were discovered Friday and were probably destined
for use in turtle soup, a favorite dish in China.</LD>
<LD>   The shipment included 1,423 Cuoras and 113 terrapin turtles from
Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo. Exporters
need a permit from the Forestry Ministry to export Cuoras, also known
as Asian box turtles, and the government bans sales of terrapins
because they are a protected species.</LD>
<TE>   Under a 1999 conservation law, the smugglers of endangered species
face a maximum five-year prison sentence and a fine of about $11,000.</TE>
<TE>   Customs officials said no arrests had been made in the case. They
said legal action will depend on further investigation by the
Forestry Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Turtle smuggling is common in Indonesia and has led to steep
declines in the numbers of many species, especially green turtles.</TE>
<TE>   This month, four men were arrested for attempting to sell 88 green
turtles on the island of Sulawesi. In January, customs officials
confiscated 329 turtles from Kalimantan being shipped to Hong Kong.</TE>

<HD>Scandals Called a Threat to Recovery</HD>
<DH>Economy: Fed chief Alan Greenspan warns new revelations of
corporate corruption could cause more damage. He calls for harsh
penalties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Congress on Tuesday
that corporate scandals threaten to injure the nation's slowly
mending economy and should be treated with stiff new penalties for
executives who cheat.</LD>
<LD>   Within hours, a Republican-controlled House dropped its previous
reluctance and rushed to join the Democrat-controlled Senate in
substantially increasing jail time for securities fraud and corporate
misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   Greenspan dispensed with his usual caution in predicting that new
revelations of corporate corruption "will no doubt surface in the
weeks ahead" and in recommending a harsh response.</LD>
<TE>   "Even a small increase in the likelihood of large, possibly
criminal, penalties for egregious behavior of CEOs can have
profoundly important effects," he told the Senate Banking Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Washington had hoped in advance of his testimony that the central
banker would calm skittish markets, and he was even interrupted by
lawmakers' updates on the market's gyrations during his remarks.
Although the market initially rose, Greenspan proved no more
successful than President Bush in convincing investors it is again
safe to buy stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average opened with a sharp drop, then
trimmed its losses as Greenspan spoke. But the Dow lost 166.08
points, or 1.8% of its value, to close at 8,473.11, its seventh
straight day of decline. Other market measures also fell, despite the
announcement of better-than-expected quarterly profits by several
companies, including Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., General Motors Corp. and
Nextel Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Boding ill for today, semiconductor giant Intel Corp. said after
the close of trading Tuesday that it will cut 4,000 jobs, or almost
5% of its work force, after sales in the April-through-June quarter
slipped and profit did not grow as much as analysts had predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan laced his testimony with some good economic news, but
that was overwhelmed by his caveats and warnings. He skipped over a
portion of his prepared remarks that said the Fed is boosting its
forecast of economic growth for the year to as much as 3.75% from
2.5% to 3%.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. economy is poised to resume a pattern of sustainable
growth," the central bank chairman said. But only, he added, after
current problems "linger for a bit longer ... and absent significant
further adverse shocks."</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps the most striking moment of his appearance, the
nation's foremost exponent of free-market capitalism sounded like one
of its most radical critics.</TE>
<TE>   He railed against the '90s stock boom for engendering "an outsized
increase in opportunities for avarice." He charged that ballooning
executive pay and stock options "perversely created incentives to
artificially inflate reported earnings in order to keep stock prices
high and rising."</TE>
<TE>   He warned that once stocks recover and the economy goes back to
growing, Americans are apt to forget the lessons of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "An infectious greed seemed to grip much of our business
community. Our historical guardians of financial information were
overwhelmed," he said of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not that humans [became] any more greedy than in
generations past," he said. "It is that the avenues to express greed
had grown so enormously."</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan called for Congress "to create ... a legal structure
which very significantly penalizes malfeasance." His suggestion was
taken up with a vengeance by some committee members.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I think that one way we could restore some confidence
in the market would be for the public to see some of the executives
who have committed fraud to walk around in handcuffs and orange
jumpsuits," said Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.)</TE>
<TE>   Having issued his call for stiffer penalties, Greenspan veered
from most other proposals for changing the way corporate America is
run.</TE>
<TE>   Although he appeared to favor a Senate-approved measure to create
an independent board to oversee the accounting profession, he
suggested that accountants' own standard-setting body, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, can handle most problems.</TE>
<TE>   He said he saw no need to change a 1995 law that restricts
class-action lawsuits against companies. With stock prices tumbling,
he said, the problems created by excessive stock option grants have
vanished on their own.</TE>
<TE>   He appeared to oppose Congress doing anything to change the way
U.S. companies are governed. "Remember, the system is frayed, but it
is not broken," he told lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), chairman of the Banking Committee,
bristled at Greenspan's go-slow approach on everything but penalties,
saying it amounts to a recipe for inaction.</TE>
<TE>   The chief sponsor of the Senate's corporate reform package said he
had talked with the authors of a series of past proposals for
changing accounting rules and corporate structure. "The constant
refrain we heard from them was that they had made very important
recommendations that had not been adopted" because the immediate
crisis passed, Sarbanes warned.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the mood in Washington is anything but go-slow. The drive
to curb corporate corruption appeared to pick up steam Tuesday when
the House reversed course and voted 391 to 28 in favor of a measure
that among other things would make securities fraud a federal crime
and boost the maximum sentence to 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   That is even tougher than the Senate measure, which would raise
the maximum sentence to 10 years from five, and represents a sharp
about-face for the GOP-controlled House, which passed a corporate
reform package only a few months ago that contained no penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting Washington's mounting concern about the fragile
condition of U.S. financial markets, senators interrupted Greenspan
at several points to report on how stock indexes were responding to
his remarks.</TE>
<TE>   When the Dow Jones industrial average pared its morning losses to
130 points from 200 points, Sarbanes suggested that Greenspan speak
indefinitely. "That's right," cried Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.).
"A filibuster by the chairman of the Fed!"</TE>
<TE>   "I thought you were going to dismiss me for the rest of the day,"
retorted Greenspan to gales of laughter.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Fed chairman's ability to nudge markets upward
proved as minimal as that of the president, who in speeches last week
and again Monday tried to highlight the economy's strengths.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Fed has increased its growth forecast for this year
and next, Greenspan acknowledged Tuesday that most of the extra
economic activity will be the result of efficiency improvements and
won't produce new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Fed economists predict the unemployment rate will fall from its
current 6% rate to between 5.25% and 5.5%, but not until the end of
2003.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan acknowledged that the pace of employment growth will be
slow largely because productivity gains allow firms to make more
goods and deliver more services without adding workers. But he said
the gains, which he has long touted as one of the economy's most
important improvements, eventually will level off, resulting in
renewed hiring.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he said, productivity gains have given the
economy the bounce to come back from a string of setbacks, including
the latest scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. economy appears to have withstood a set of blows--major
declines in equity markets, a sharp retrenchment in investment
spending, and the tragic terrorist attacks of last September--that in
previous business cycles almost surely would have induced a severe
contraction," Greenspan said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact the nation has not taken a steep fall to date is a
testament to the economy's new "resilience and flexibility," he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Heat Wave, Power Plant Crash Sap State's Electricity Supplies,"
July 11: Last year, we put up with rolling blackouts and dramatic
increases in our electricity bills that will be the norm for decades.
We watched Gov. Gray Davis and his people make deals to supposedly
correct the electricity problem. We watched them spend billions of
state surplus dollars to pay for the deals, only to plunge this state
into billions of dollars worth of debt. We watched PG&amp;E and Edison
crumble. Davis assured us that the electricity problems were solved.</LD>
<LD>   On July 9, Californians were once again warned that the entire
state was under a Stage 1 alert concerning possible electricity
shortages. The very next day, we were warned that the state was on a
Stage 2 alert, and that rolling blackouts may very well be necessary.
I shudder to think about what kind of alerts August and September
will bring.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks, Gray, for all your leadership. While I'm not quite ready
to vote for Bill Simon in November, I'll cast a write-in vote for
Scooby-Doo instead of Davis.</LD>

<LD>Kudos for your extensive July 10 obituary on Rod Steiger, "Method
Actor Infused His Roles With Raw Intensity." In that piece, Times
film reviewer Kevin Thomas correctly asserted that Steiger's
commanding best shone through even in the supporting roles of his
later years. At the time I had not yet viewed his earlier films, but
his gritty 1996 turn as a corrupt former Detroit cop trying to help
his son (played by Ken Olin) in Paul Haggis' pilot for "EZ Streets"
inspired me to do so. Wow. A lion has indeed left the circus.</LD>

<LD>Re "SEC Chief Insists He Won't Quit," July 15: In Bush's "CEO"
presidency, everyone else is held accountable but the CEO (who can
blame the lawyers and political opponents when convenient). And the
same bureaucrats who oversee massive failures (e.g., Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt) are charged with restoring
the public's faith in our most important institutions, while
disclaiming any responsibility for destroying them. The consequences
are now clear: less transparency and more arrogance shrouded in a
veil of wishful thinking.</LD>
<LD>   No wonder foreign investors, the only ones who can finance our
return to massive budget deficits, are finally looking elsewhere.</LD>

<TE>   Listening to George Dubya talk about morality and character in
business is laughable. Even a perfunctory examination of his dubious
business "career" exposes him as a poster boy for turning failed
business ventures into massive personal gain. The current corporate
climate in America is a direct reflection of the administration in
Washington, from the influence of energy companies to the head of the
SEC, not to mention the lowering of EPA standards and the imposition
of tariffs, to name a few. If you need further proof, check the
federal deficit, then thank God we didn't let this clown privatize
Social Security.</TE>

<TE>   "Why Investigation of Bush's Stock Sale 'Just Didn't Pan Out,' "
July 14: One would like to think the SEC did not prosecute Bush for
illegality or fraud because there was no evidence that his decision
to sell was based on insider information. However, we now learn that
the SEC did not prosecute because the market price of the stock did
not plummet dramatically after he sold it. Apparently the SEC
considered insider trading to be illegal only if the results of the
trade met what the SEC believed were the trader's expectations.</TE>
<TE>   How did the SEC know that the modest rather than dramatic price
fall did not meet Bush's expectations? It is incredible that
regardless of the results of the trade, the SEC did not investigate
further to determine whether Bush's decision to sell was based on
illegally obtained information.</TE>

<TE>   So our federal legislators--who have demonstrated their financial
acumen and business sense through supervising those wonderfully
accurate federal budgets, touting full disclosure of the activities
of their pork-barrel divisions, avoiding all conflicts of interest
through refusing campaign contributions or giving special treatment
to any of their customers, championing the reduction of government
expenses in order to reduce government losses and successfully
managing the national pension plan--now feel they are capable of
passing new laws to cure abuses in similar areas by those in charge
of private businesses. But will they ever look in the mirror?</TE>

<TE>   To restore faith in the market, Congress must pass accounting and
business-practice reform with a minimum of partisan rhetoric. By
turning the issue into a political attack on the president, the
Democratic Party has spooked an already jittery market to the point

investors who, in good faith, bought into the American dream
(Opinion, July 14). Those of us who started investing on a small
scale 30 or more years ago, well before the spectacular 1990s, should
not be cast in the same mold as the powerful financial figures who
knowingly reported nonexisting profits and hid existing indebtedness
in order to enrich themselves at the expense of their own employees
and the general public.</TE>
<TE>   Now, what was to have been a well-earned nest egg to see us
through retirement has eroded day by day. Then we are told it is our
own greed that brought this about. How terribly unfair to blame the
victims.</TE>

<HD>Questioning Muslims' Attitudes Toward Terror</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Khaled Abou El Fadl unfortunately contradicts himself when one
compares his July 14 and Sept. 14 commentaries ("U.S. Muslims, Unify
and Stand Up" and "What Became of Tolerance in Islam?"). On Sept. 14
he wrote, "Muslim and Arab organizations have rushed to issue
condemnations of terrorism and hate-motivated violence," while on
July 14 he suggested that such condemnations were sporadic following
Sept. 11. Condemnations were abundant, as anyone who followed the
media back then would know.</LD>
<LD>   I am not sure why Abou El Fadl, whom I admire and respect, would
make such an accusation against Muslim organizations that could be
legitimately criticized in many other ways. Criticizing Muslim groups
for not distributing bumper stickers with his pet slogan is silly.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmed Shaikh</LD>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl's words were welcome, in that he acknowledged the
Muslim community's responsibility to completely distance itself from
terrorism. However, there is one fatal flaw in his essay: He not once
condemned or even mentioned suicide attacks against innocent
Israelis. His words thus breathe life into the belief shared by many
in the Muslim world that there are "good terrorists" and bad ones.
His essay is, therefore, as fruitless as the half-measures taken by
the Muslim community that he condemns.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Margols</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As someone who grew up with Abou El Fadl, I was devastated to read
his article. Abou El Fadl has fallen into the simplistic trap of
Muslim-bashing.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the Los Angeles-based Muslim Public Affairs
Council, I am personally aware of dozens of events commemorating the
victims of 9/11, as well as condemnations issued by American Muslim
organizations and leaders. The problem is not silence by American
Muslims; the problem is the deaf ears of the media. I can list
several events sponsored by American Muslim organizations where the
media failed to provide any coverage whatsoever.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the three suggestions made by Abou El Fadl were
implemented months ago by Muslim groups including the Muslim Public
Affairs Council. A unified statement was issued by all major American
Muslim organizations on 9/11, as this was the day American Muslim
leaders were scheduled to meet with President Bush (a meeting that
was postponed and took place three weeks later). Muslim organizations
are already working in partnership with the FBI to deal with the
scourge of terrorism. Muslims under an organization formed in New
York (American Muslims Against Terrorism) visited ground zero and
expressed in no uncertain terms our solidarity with the victims. Here
in Los Angeles, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, in a public forum,
offered thanks and donations to police and fire personnel.</TE>

people have roof rats on their properties. Roof rats (Rattus rattus)
don't come from our wild lands. They are human-introduced pests that
are from the Old World. Roof rats and our household cockroaches, as
well as European pigeons, are rarely found far from human habitation.

<LD>Re "Spielbergs Keep Brentwood Range Open," July 9: Anyone who visits
Sullivan Canyon for the first time has pretty much the same reaction
as our friend did when she came down with her daughter last week:
"This is amazing," she said. "It's like leaving the city behind."</LD>
<LD>   Open space is a scarce commodity in L.A.; we tend to think of it
as houses waiting to happen. But Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw's
donation of the funds needed to purchase Sullivan Canyon guarantees
that one of the last public recreation areas on the city's Westside
will remain just that--open and available to people who would like to
catch their breath without having to leave town. An hour in the
canyon is a restorative.</LD>
<LD>   Sullivan Canyon is a piece of L.A. history saved; the donation is
an altruistic gesture. Parents who played in the canyon as kids bring
their children there, and now that the property is safe, they can
plan on coming again as grandparents.</LD>

<LD>I want to state upfront that I love dogs. I have had dogs as part of
my family most of my life. We loved them, cared for them, cried when
they died. However, we must not put any animal on the same level as a
human being. Calling ourselves their "guardians" instead of "owners"
puts dogs on the same level as humans.</LD>
<LD>   Elliot M. Katz, a veterinarian and founder of In Defense of
Animals, should not compare how a dog is treated with how minorities,
the handicapped or children are treated (July 9). There is a vast
difference between how we treat an animal and how we treat members of
our fellow human family. I would urge the City Council to veto this
request.</LD>

<HD>Davis' Filing Reveals $32-Million War Chest</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor's early financial report reflects a huge
edge over Simon, who is struggling to explain his tax shelter that
the IRS questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As Gov. Gray Davis filed papers showing he has $32 million banked for
his reelection campaign, his Republican rival, Bill Simon Jr.,
continued to struggle Tuesday to explain his use of a tax shelter
that the Internal Revenue Service says could be illegal.</LD>
<LD>   The Davis report, reflecting the governor's huge financial
advantage over Simon, came as the Republican nominee once again
retooled his team of advisors, naming his fourth campaign manager
since March.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic governor released his fund-raising report two weeks
before the legal deadline in an apparent effort to reinforce
perceptions that the Simon campaign is in trouble. Those perceptions
have been fueled by a combination of the continuing staff shakeups,
Simon's slow pace of fund-raising, and his difficulty in shifting the
campaign debate away from his refusal to release his tax returns.</LD>
<TE>   Simon's campaign declined to release its latest fund-raising
report early, as Davis did, but a Simon advisor said the document
will show that the GOP candidate had $5 million on hand as of June
30. That means the Davis war chest would be roughly six times bigger,
with four months of fund-raising to go.</TE>
<TE>   The money is particularly important in California, where statewide
television advertising can easily churn through close to $2 million
each week in the heat of the fall campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of the multiple problems facing Simon, it was not his
fund-raising but his tax returns that dominated his one-hour lunch
Tuesday with state political reporters. Pressed repeatedly, the
candidate doggedly declined to discuss details about the tax shelter
he used.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe everybody looks to be tax efficient," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He added: "I don't think there's anything wrong with that."</TE>
<TE>   Simon and his team made no public announcement during the day of
the latest staff changeover, which was outlined in a Times article
Tuesday morning. Instead, the switch was disclosed to Simon's staff
in an e-mail hastily dispatched Monday night by chief strategist Sal
Russo.</TE>
<TE>   In his e-mail, Russo announced the elevation of Rob Lapsley, the
head of Simon's communications shop, to campaign manager in place of
John Peschong, who took the job just a month ago. The campaign is
also shopping for yet another media advisor to join Russo, the
producer of Simon's TV ads, and others already on board.</TE>
<TE>   According to GOP figures who have discussed the issue with the
campaign and national party officials, the reshuffling was forced on
Simon by White House political operatives unhappy with Russo and
eager to see a more assertive Simon effort against Davis, one of
President Bush's highest-profile Democratic opponents.</TE>
<TE>   With the latest changes, the Simon campaign has swelled to more
than 100 employees, another issue of concern among Republicans who
say the candidate has little to show for his bulging payroll. Davis,
in contrast, has only 31 full-time campaign workers.</TE>
<TE>   For six weeks, the governor has been outspending Simon on
television ads--the most important means of communicating with
California voters--and is likely to continue to do so until election
day unless Simon dips into his personal fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Simon and his family spent $5.5 million of their money during the
GOP primary, but aides have voiced concern that donations will dry up
if he starts bankrolling the general-election race too soon.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how much money Simon, a wealthy investment banker,
could put into the race, because he has refused to divulge his net
worth, much less how much of it is liquid.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's worth $300 million or $400 million, that's one thing,"
said GOP pollster Dick Dresner. "If he's worth $50 million, that's a
whole other ballgame. And if it's $20 million, then he's not going to
make it."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever his financial capacity, Simon's personal wealth has
dominated the campaign since the IRS filed legal papers last week
that listed him as a beneficiary of a tax shelter that it says could
be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign has used the IRS disclosure to renew its demand
that Simon release his tax returns, but the GOP candidate said
Tuesday that he was not "rethinking" his decision to keep them
private. He said he will make his future tax returns public only if
he is elected governor.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that the people of California, at that point, when I'm
their governor, working for them, have a right to know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At a Sacramento Press Club lunch with several dozen reporters,
Simon said he had "over-complied" with state law by filing an
extensive disclosure report on his personal finances last year. He
acknowledged, though, that it did not contain any information about
the "investment transaction" that the IRS has contested.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS has not accused Simon or the other beneficiaries of such
tax shelters of wrongdoing, but is investigating the accounting firms
that set them up.</TE>
<TE>   Since April, when Simon first rejected Davis' demand that he
release his tax returns, the issue has become a more significant
challenge for Simon's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The bookkeeping scandals at WorldCom, Global Crossing and other
companies have made it harder for Simon to argue that full disclosure
of his financial records would violate his privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters have come to expect that politicians release as much
information as possible--and that includes tax returns," said Sherry
Bebitch Jeffe, a USC political science professor. The IRS disclosure
of the tax shelter has aggravated the problem, making it easier for
Davis--as he has in a television ad--to question whether his GOP
rival has paid his fair share of taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, chief campaign strategist for Davis, said the issue
is "certainly significant to voters who know very, very little about
this man to begin with--and particularly in the face of all the
disclosures that we now see every day on the front page of the
newspapers about corporate executives trying to avoid paying taxes."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon accused Davis trying to divert attention from his poor
record on issues voters care about, such as schools, roads, water,
power and the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates for governor are not required by law to release their
tax returns, but Davis has done so, in keeping with a common practice
for politicians seeking or holding high public office.</TE>

<HD>Body Found Could Be Abducted O.C. Girl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The frantic search for a 5-year-old girl snatched from outside her
Orange County condominium came to a heart-stopping pause late Tuesday
with discovery of a child's body beside a mountain road west of Lake
Elsinore.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Sheriff Michael Carona said investigators will not
be able to determine if the body is that of Samantha Runnion of
Stanton until early today. But it is a girl between 4 and 6, and
"there are enough similarities ... to lead us to believe it could be
Samantha."</LD>
<LD>   After word of the discovery, Samantha's family called off public
appearances and went into seclusion with crisis counselors. "They're
hoping and praying, as we all are, that it's not Samantha," Carona
said.</LD>
<TE>   The abduction, which immediately attracted national media
attention, was the fourth high-profile kidnapping of a young girl in
the last few months. Experts caution, however, that kidnappings of
this sort remain uncommon. The vast majority of child abductions
involve custody disputes, and deaths are rare.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's body was spotted just after 3 p.m. by two men at a
hang-glider launch point off the Ortega Highway, a mountain road that
winds through the Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The body was left in the rugged terrain above the road. "You could
see it--it wasn't hidden," said Riverside County Sheriff's Sgt.
Shelley Kennedy-Smith, adding that detectives are now checking for
tire tracks and other evidence. "Obviously, the person who left the
body here wanted it to be found."</TE>
<TE>   The killer left unspecified clues at the scene, said Orange County
Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo. "We're very confident that we're
going to be able to hunt this guy down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery capped a day of frenzied activity. Police launched a
search for Samantha shortly after she was reportedly carried off
screaming as she played outside her family's condominium Monday
evening.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the day, Samantha's mother broadcast a desperate plea and
donors quickly offered rewards totaling $60,000 in the hope of a
quick recovery. But investigators said they were stymied by the lack
of clues. They focused on a kidnapper described as a Latino male in
his 20s with a mustache and short black hair, wearing a powder-blue,
button-down shirt and driving a light green car--possibly a Honda.</TE>
<TE>   But all those details came from a 5-year-old witness, and
authorities were uncertain how much weight to give them.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know who or what we're dealing with," Carona said
Tuesday afternoon, before the body was discovered. "We're not sure if
it's a stalker, a friend of the family or a random act."</TE>
<TE>   Father Interviewed</TE>
<TE>   Authorities interviewed Samantha's biological father, Derek
Jackson, from his home in Massachusetts and said they do not believe
Samantha was the victim of a custody dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's mother, Erin Runnion, 27, repeatedly went before
reporters to appeal for her daughter's return. "Samantha, if you are
watching, baby, I love you," she said early Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "You are such a good girl. You're so clever. Please ask your
captor to let you go.... Please let her go. She is such a sweet
child. We don't want vengeance. We just want our baby back."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was abducted shortly before 7 p.m. Monday as she played
with a 5-year-old friend, Sarah, on a low wall outside their
condominium complex in Stanton, a working-class city in northern
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah said Tuesday that a man in a light green car drove past them
slowly, then turned around and came back and parked in front of them.
The man got out and walked up to the two girls.</TE>
<TE>   "The bad guy said, 'You see a little chihuahua?' " Sarah said.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha asked the man how big the dog was, bending down to use
her hand to suggest a height. The man scooped Samantha up, grabbing
her under the arms and carrying her screaming to his car, then drove
off, Sarah said.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah said she ran back to her condo and told her mother, and both
went to the Runnion home and told Samantha's grandmother. By the time
sheriff's deputies arrived a few minutes later, the car and the girl
were gone.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 state and local law enforcement officials were
joined Tuesday by about 30 FBI agents in efforts that included
scouring state auto registrations for green Hondas, searching
databases of sex offenders for possible suspects and alerting the
U.S. Border Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Police also canvassed neighborhood businesses in hopes that
security cameras might have captured an image of the car, and
conducted an extensive search of the neighborhood itself.</TE>
<TE>   Rewards Posted</TE>
<TE>   As it became clear that Samantha was not in the area, authorities
said, they expanded their focus. The Center for Missing and Exploited
Children began disseminating posters displaying a photo of Samantha
and a composite sketch of the kidnapper.</TE>
<TE>   The posted rewards include $50,000 pledged by British Petroleum,
where Erin Runnion works as an analyst, and $10,000 by the Coalition
of Police and Sheriffs, a law enforcement organization. Stanton
officials said they also may offer a reward.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they hope to draw out witnesses who may recognize
the abductor. "Hopefully, someone will see the broadcasts and
recognize the subject and contact authorities," said Jim Amormino,
spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they were trying to make sense of some puzzling
details. For instance, access to the condominium complex is limited,
and Westcliff Road, where Samantha was playing, is on the back side
of a loop that weaves through the complex--not an easy spot for a
snatch-and-run kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the kidnapper did not take the quickest route out, heading
north instead of south. Despite this most recent high-profile
snatching, experts said kidnappings by strangers have remained steady
in recent years. Unrelated kidnappings that have grabbed the nation's
attention in recent months include the disappearance and killing of
7-year-old Danielle van Dam in San Diego last year. Family
acquaintance David Westerfield is on trial for murder in that case.</TE>
<TE>   In April, 2-year-old Jahi Turner also disappeared in San Diego, a
case authorities are treating as a kidnapping. And in June,
14-year-old Elizabeth Smart was taken in the middle of the night from
her family's Salt Lake City home.</TE>
<TE>   "We only get 200 to 300 of this type of abduction a year," said
Tina Schwartz, spokeswoman for the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children, outside Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "To keep things in perspective, these are scary cases but parents
need to remember that they are very rare."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Mai Tran, Jeff Gottlieb, Jack Leonard, Evan
Halper and Tina Dirmann contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>   Samantha was always reminded during these sessions to scream for
help or yell "Fire!" if she was ever forced into a car. She would
reassure her mom that she would get away because "she could run
really fast and was as strong as Hercules."</LD>
<LD>   Runnion, 27, recalled those words Tuesday as she sat on Samantha's
bed hours after her little girl was whisked away, kicking and
screaming, by an apparent stranger.</LD>
<TE>   It was a day filled with anguish and second-guessing for Runnion.
It started at 6:30 a.m. with a plea broadcast around the nation for
her daughter's safe return. By evening, as police converged on a
mountain road in Riverside County where an unidentified girl's body
was discovered, she and family members canceled a scheduled
appearance on CNN and went into seclusion.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview around noon, Runnion fretted about whether the
role-playing drills were enough to protect her daughter from harm,
but she still held out hope that Samantha would be home in time for
her sixth birthday next week.</TE>
<TE>   "These things just never seem to have happy endings. And I want
her to change that," Runnion said Tuesday afternoon, before the body
was discovered. "She's a little fighter. She's a smart kid. And I
just keep thinking, if she gets the opportunity, she'll take it."</TE>
<TE>   Runnion and her boyfriend, Ken Donnelly, spent the night
frantically walking and driving around Stanton, hanging up fliers and
searching for Samantha. At one point, Runnion spotted a light green
Honda that fit the description of the car that fled with her daughter
inside. In desperation, she pounced on the hood and asked the driver
to open his trunk. He drove away.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard her in my head, screaming out to me, 'Mommy!' And I
jumped on his car," Runnion said. She later realized the car had
nothing to do with the case.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha, nicknamed "Mantha" by her mom, was born in Northampton,
Mass. She is Runnion's only child from a former relationship with
Derek Jackson, whom she met while attending Hampshire College in
Amherst, Mass. She met Donnelly four years ago, and she and Samantha
have been living with him and his two children from a former
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Runnion began teaching Samantha about staying away from strangers
when they were living in a rougher neighborhood in nearby Garden
Grove. She thought her daughter could be an easy target.</TE>
<TE>   "She's cute, and it always did scare me.... I used to worry about
that kind of thing more in Garden Grove, where there was a halfway
house down the street," Runnion said. "I had to explain why she
couldn't play in the frontyard."</TE>
<TE>   The couple moved with all three children to Smoketree Condominiums
in 2000, and Runnion believed the complex, filled with families and
young children, would be a safe place for Samantha to play. Runnion's
mother, Virginia Runnion, watched the children during the day while
Runnion worked as an analyst at British Petroleum in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha just finished the first grade at nearby Ernest O.
Lawrence Elementary School. She plays with Barbie dolls and wants to
be a dancer when she grows up. She told her mother a few days ago
that she wanted to resume ballet lessons she had taken until
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother said Samantha adores Hercules. A poster of the Greek
hero hangs over her headboard, side-by-side with a picture of another
hero, Peter Pan.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's mother, who studied Latin American culture in college,
called her daughter "mi cielito linda" (my pretty little sky) and
"tigrita" (my little tiger) during her comments to the media Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Her phrasing was an attempt to reach out to her captor, who is
described by investigators as a Latino man. Runnion says she wanted
to make Samantha seem real to him.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's birthday is July 26, and her mother has gathered nearly
everything she wanted: the three-dimensional dinosaur puzzle, new
dresses for Barbie, Legos and Lincoln Logs.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a trunkful of her presents," Runnion said, smiling at the
thought of Samantha opening her gifts.</TE>
<TE>   "She asked for everything her brother got on his birthday in May,
plus the girl stuff."</TE>

<HD>Percy Yutar, 90; Led Prosecution of Mandela in 1964 Treason
Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Percy Yutar, the prosecutor who won life sentences against Nelson
Mandela and other African National Congress leaders in the 1964
Rivonia treason trial, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Yutar died Saturday, months after suffering a stroke and a heart
attack, said his wife, Cecilia, according to the South African Press
Assn.</LD>
<LD>   As one of the most prominent Jewish lawyers working in the
anti-Semitic climate of the racist, apartheid government, Yutar was
said to have worked tirelessly to prove his loyalty to South Africa.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the prejudice that confined him to clerical jobs when he
became a lawyer, Yutar rose to become the first Jewish attorney
general in the country when he was named the top lawyer of the Orange
Free State in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest case was the Rivonia treason trial, which took its
name from the area near Johannesburg, where some of Mandela's ANC
colleagues were arrested in a raid on the secret headquarters of
their guerrilla movement.</TE>
<TE>   During his relentless--and what some critics called
shoddy--prosecution of the case, he argued that Mandela, Walter
Sisulu and other ANC leaders were lying when they said they
represented the dreams of South Africa's blacks for freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "The deceit of the accused is amazing.... They took it on
themselves to tell the world that the Africans in South Africa are
suppressed, oppressed and depressed," Yutar said. "It is a great pity
that the rank-and-file of the Bantu [blacks] in the country, who are
peaceful, law-abiding, faithful and loyal, should have been duped by
false promises."</TE>
<TE>   In his autobiography, "Long Walk to Freedom," Mandela called Yutar
shrill and accused him of petty machinations during the case.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Joffe, the lead defense attorney in the trial, said later
that Yutar was particularly aggressive toward the Jewish defendants.</TE>
<TE>   He "seemed to regard it as a duty to prove to the government that
there were 'good Jews,' through his own enthusiastic persecution of
these subversive Jews," Joffe said.</TE>
<TE>   After the collapse of apartheid, Yutar worked fruitlessly to
rehabilitate his image in the new South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his energetic prosecution in the Rivonia case, Yutar
insisted he had saved them from hanging by charging them only with
sabotage instead of treason, though sabotage also carried the death
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, in what was seen as the ultimate act of
reconciliation, Mandela invited Yutar for lunch in 1995, a year after
he was elected the country's first black president.</TE>
<TE>   Yutar later called Mandela, whom he had once accused of being a
Communist stooge plotting a bloody revolution, "a saintly man."</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Cape Town after his family emigrated from
Lithuania. His father was a butcher, and Yutar was expected to work
in the family business, but he was seriously injured in an accident
that left the fingers on one hand mangled.</TE>
<TE>   He attended the University of Cape Town on a scholarship and was
eventually awarded a doctorate in law.</TE>
<TE>   After winning the Rivonia case, Yutar was named attorney general
of the Orange Free State and later the Transvaal. He retired 12 years
later.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Yutar is survived by a son, David.</TE>

the House prepared to follow suit, possibly setting up a veto
showdown with President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate Appropriations Committee voted unanimously to lift the
4-decade-old travel curbs on the Communist island as it cleared an
$18.5-billion spending bill to fund the U.S. Treasury and general
government operations next year.</LD>

<HD>'Greed' Inflates Drug Prices, Democrats Say</HD>
<DH>Politics: The party expands its drive against corporate
corruption and pushes a new bill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Carrying anti-corporate fervor to a new legislative front, Senate
Democrats on Tuesday kicked off debate on how to help consumers meet
the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs--and accused
pharmaceutical companies of padding their profits at the expense of
consumers.</LD>
<LD>   Just one day after the Senate unanimously approved a bill to crack
down on corporate corruption, the chasm between the parties reopened
as the Democrats pressed their proposal to expand Medicare to cover
prescription drug costs.</LD>
<LD>   "What this debate is about is greed--corporate greed," said Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). "Prescription drug legislation is going
to be opposed by those that are profiteering."</LD>
<TE>   The Republican-controlled House kept the corporate reform ball
rolling by passing legislation to increase criminal penalties for
securities fraud and corporate misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The day's actions on both sides of the Capitol illustrated how the
issue of corporate reform is likely to linger in Congress, filtering
into debate on other issues.</TE>
<TE>   The start of the Senate's debate on prescription drug costs also
underscored how sharply and abruptly the congressional agenda has
come to be dominated by issues on which Democrats traditionally
dominate.</TE>
<TE>   "What [the prescription drug] issue symbolizes is that the
political zeitgeist has shifted to Democratic turf," said Marshall
Wittmann, a conservative analyst at the Hudson Institute, a
Washington research group. "What's most striking is that both sides
are quibbling about a major expansion of a government program at a
time of burgeoning [federal] budget deficits."</TE>
<TE>   Just a few months ago, Democrats were in a defensive crouch as
President Bush and his GOP allies commanded the stronger political
position, in part because the congressional agenda was dominated by
national security issues.</TE>
<TE>   Another act of terrorism would return the focus to security
concerns. But polls have indicated in recent weeks that, heading into
the fall elections, voters are more concerned about domestic issues
such as the economy and health care. For instance, a June poll by the
Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 56% of
those surveyed wanted to hear political candidates address domestic
issues, compared with 20% wanting to hear about terrorism and
security.</TE>
<TE>   In that environment, Democrats are hoping their call for a
Medicare prescription drug benefit will have new momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans sought to blunt that advantage by recently passing
their version of a prescription drug bill in the GOP-dominated House.
But Democrats say that bill, which would cost about $350 billion over
10 years, is too limited to meet the needs of Medicare beneficiaries.
Democrats also criticize the measure's reliance on private insurers
to offer the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats want to showcase their more generous alternative in the
Senate, which Democrats control by a one-vote margin. Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) has set aside two weeks for debate on
Medicare, prescription drug costs and related matters.</TE>
<TE>   But the outcome of the debate is far from certain. For procedural
reasons, any proposal will have to be passed with at least 60
votes--and members of both parties concede that none of the major
alternatives has reached that threshold.</TE>
<TE>   That presents the distinct possibility that after its spotlight on
the issue, the Senate will remain without a bill.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans say Daschle has deliberately rigged the debate to that
end: to produce a political impasse and blame the Republicans in the
fall campaigns. Daschle denied that is his aim, suggesting there is
real political risks to stalemating on an issue for which public
demand is so great.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to act would put the Senate in a bad light," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's immediate focus is a bill to speed up the process of
getting cheaper generic drugs to market, which supporters tout as a
limited but significant step toward controlling drug costs. The bill
is designed to close a legal loophole that allows pharmaceutical
companies to delay the marketing of generic versions of drugs when
their patents run out.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans warn that the bill goes too far and threatens to
undermine the incentive for drug companies to develop pioneering
medicines.</TE>
<TE>   But if the broader effort to enact a prescription drug benefit for
senior citizens collapses, Congress may yet approve some version of
the generic drug bill, said Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.). As a
Democratic aide put it, Republicans "want to get something done on
drugs. They are not going to want to go home empty-handed."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Democrats are planning to make the generic drug bill the
vehicle for amendments to expand Medicare drug coverage. Debate is
expected to revolve, at least initially, around two major
alternatives:</TE>
<TE>   * The leading Democratic proposal, co-sponsored by Kennedy and
Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), would cover prescription drug costs for
seniors through Medicare. Sponsors said it would cost $500 billion
over seven years. It would require enrollees to pay a monthly premium
of $25 and a co-payment of $10 for generic drugs or $40 for
brand-name drugs. Republican critics say the Kennedy-Graham bill is a
budget-busting new entitlement that the nation cannot afford.</TE>
<TE>   * A less-costly centrist alternative--called the "tripartisan"
bill because its Senate sponsors include Republican Charles E.
Grassley of Iowa, independent James M. Jeffords of Vermont and
Democrat John B. Breaux of Louisiana--would cost $370 billion over 10
years. It would set a $250 annual deductible, and monthly premiums
would be an estimated $24. But instead of providing the benefit
through Medicare, the government would pay subsidies to private
insurers who provide drug coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic critics say the plan, like the version passed by the
House, would leave too much to the initiative of private insurers and
fail to guarantee that affordable benefits would be available. On the
other hand, some conservative Republicans object to the plan as too
expensive.</TE>

<HD>President Picks Ex-Aide as Mexico Ambassador</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Tony Garza, 53, was his secretary of state and
served as Texas' chief liaison to Mexico when Bush was governor of
the Lone Star State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Tony Garza, a prominent Texas Republican politician and former aide
to then-Gov. George W. Bush, is the president's choice to be the next
U.S. ambassador to Mexico, the White House announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Garza, 53, a second-generation American of Mexican descent, was
Texas' chief liaison to Mexico while Bush was governor. He became the
first Latino Republican elected to statewide office in Texas in 1998,
when he was elected to the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates
energy production.</LD>
<LD>   ''Tony Garza has an in-depth understanding of the relationship
between the United States and Mexico and its impact on the people of
both nations,'' Bush said in a statement. ''He has served the people
of Texas with honor and distinction and will be an outstanding
representative of the United States.''</LD>
<TE>   Garza's selection, which has been rumored for months, may be aimed
in part at building support for the administration among Latinos.
Administration officials may also hope that the selection of a close
former Bush aide will help strengthen the White House's relationship
with the government of Mexican President Vicente Fox, strained in
recent months because Bush has been unable to fulfill a campaign
promise to ease immigration restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The current ambassador to Mexico, Jeffrey Davidow, is a career
diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) said, Garza will ''represent
our country well from a perspective of experience and knowledge of
the problems on both sides of the border.''</TE>
<TE>   Another Texas Republican official, who asked to remain
unidentified, said that while Garza was well liked in Texas GOP
circles, it was unclear that he had the background for a job that may
involve delicate negotiations on such issues as trade and
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Garza was raised in Brownsville, Texas, a predominantly Latino
city on the Mexico border. In 1994, Bush named him Texas secretary of
state.</TE>
<TE>   Since becoming president, Bush has chosen Garza to be part of a
delegation that observed voter registration in El Salvador and
Nicaragua.</TE>
<TE>   Garza had been mentioned as a candidate for federal housing
secretary and as a successor to retiring Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   When the nomination is considered by the Senate, Garza could face
questions about contacts with Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy
concern that collapsed amid scandal last December. Garza was one of
many politicians who accepted campaign contributions from Enron; he
has returned $21,600 to a fund for employees who were financially
devastated by the company's problems.</TE>
<TE>   As Texas secretary of state, Garza participated in discussions
with Enron and Mexican officials about energy exploration in Mexico.
Lynne Weil, a spokeswoman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
said the contacts ''will obviously come up.''</TE>

<HD>Divided Jurors Convict Officer of Perjury in Louima Torture
Case Retrial</HD>
<DH>Courts: But they deadlock over the more serious charges
against Charles Schwarz. He could get five years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A sometimes contentious and divided jury convicted former police
officer Charles Schwarz of perjury Tuesday but failed to reach
agreement on whether he helped torture Abner Louima in the bathroom
of a Brooklyn police station in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   The jurors found that Schwarz lied when he denied leading Louima,
a Haitian immigrant, from the front desk of the police precinct
toward the bathroom.</LD>
<LD>   But it was deadlocked on more serious charges that Schwarz
conspired to violate Louima's civil rights and gave false statements
about actually being in the bathroom where Louima was sodomized with
a broken broomstick.</LD>
<TE>   The viciousness of the assault on Aug. 9, 1997, shocked the city,
sparked demonstrations and caused serious concern about the adequacy
of supervision in the New York Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Reena Raggi accepted the partial verdict on
the sixth day of deliberations and set sentencing for Sept. 20.
Schwarz, 36, could receive a maximum of five years in prison for his
perjury conviction.</TE>
<TE>   The jury told Raggi of its verdict in a note, which she showed to
prosecution and defense lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   The judge then asked the jurors to continue deliberating, but they
indicated to do so would be fruitless, and Raggi declared a mistrial
on the deadlocked charges.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions in the jury room surfaced when a juror sent Raggi a note
last week charging that some members of the panel were biased because
of their previous knowledge of the widely publicized case.</TE>
<TE>   Acting U.S. Atty. Alan Vinegrad said the government was prepared
to retry Schwarz on the remaining charges.</TE>
<TE>   ''I was not in that bathroom,'' Schwarz said outside federal court
in Brooklyn after the jury's verdict. ''The truth has always been on
my side.''</TE>
<TE>   Louima appeared as a prosecution witness and said that police
officer Justin Volpe, who pleaded guilty in May 1999 to attacking
Louima with the broomstick, warned him in the bathroom that ''he was
going to do something to me, and if I make any noise, he'll kill
me.''</TE>
<TE>   Volpe is serving a 30-year prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Louima never identified Schwarz by name as the second officer who
held him down in the bathroom of the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn,
telling the jury it was the driver who transported him to the station
house.</TE>
<TE>   Both the prosecution and the defense agreed that Schwarz drove the
police car. But defense attorney Ronald Fischetti stressed that
Schwarz never participated in the bathroom attack.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argued that Schwarz had a motive to hold Louima down
in the bathroom: He believed the Haitian immigrant had punched him
during a melee outside a Brooklyn nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   Two police officers testified for the prosecution. Mark Schofield
and Eric Turetzky said they witnessed Schwarz take Louima away from
the front desk of the station house. Turetzky said he saw Schwarz
escorting Louima toward the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Volpe, testifying for the defense, said the second officer in the
bathroom with him was Thomas Wiese. In February, a federal appeals
court ordered a new trial for Schwarz, who was convicted in 1998 on
civil rights charges. He was serving a 15-year prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   In their decision, the judges said the first trial was tainted by
news reports and that Schwarz's lawyer did not defend him adequately.</TE>
<TE>   The attack on Louima was so brutal that the former security guard
spent two months in hospitals. He later sued New York City and
received an $8.7-million settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz did not testify during the trial. His lawyers contended he
remained at the police station's front desk, where he completed
Louima's arrest forms, and then went into the street, where he
searched the patrol car that transported Louima to the precinct.</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Indicted a 3rd Time in Attacks</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged in the Sept. 11 attacks,
was indicted for a third time Tuesday so prosecutors could specify
the alleged conduct that would warrant his execution.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment said Moussaoui acted in "an especially heinous,
cruel and depraved manner," with premeditation, to cause death and
commit terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The charges were an attempt to undermine a challenge by
Moussaoui's court-appointed lawyers to the federal death penalty law.
The defense lawyers filed the challenge last week in anticipation of
the new indictment.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors have told a judge they would seek to execute Moussaoui
if he were convicted of conspiracy to commit terrorism and other
charges related to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   They returned to the grand jury because the Supreme Court ruled
last month that juries, not judges, must make the decisions on life
or death.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors acted even though the justices focused on trial
juries, not grand juries.</TE>

<HD>HIV-Positive Muppet Not for U.S., PBS Says</HD>
<DH>Media: The character will join South African shows. U.S.
lawmakers deem it inappropriate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN and LISA FACKLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Public Broadcasting Service sent a letter to a group of concerned
lawmakers Tuesday assuring them that no public funding is going
toward the introduction of an HIV-positive Muppet in the South
African production of the children's show "Sesame Street," while
reiterating that there are no plans to introduce a similar character
in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   PBS President Pat Mitchell was responding to a letter from House
Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.)
and five members of the committee, which has budgetary oversight of
public broadcasting.</LD>
<LD>   Tauzin's letter, sent late Friday, expressed concern that the
character is inappropriate for the show's 2- to 4-year-old viewers.
It came just days after oversight hearings on public broadcasting,
and Mitchell said in her letter that she was unaware of the plans for
the character when she testified.</LD>
<TE>   Tauzin's office jumped on the issue after an executive at Sesame
Workshop, the show's producer, was quoted as saying the character
developed for South Africa's "Takalani Sesame" might appear in the
U.S. version of the show. Sesame Workshop said the executive misspoke
and there had been no discussions about bringing the character to the
original program.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell pointed out in her letter that Tauzin's staff was
notified that the character would not join the U.S. show the morning
that his letter went out; however, Tauzin aide Ken Johnson said the
congressman "was under the impression that plans were moving
forward," adding, "We had a real simple argument: Why can't kids just
be kids for a while? They're going to grow up fast enough and learn
about AIDS, world famine, terrorism soon enough."</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern really lies with the target audience of 'Sesame
Street,' " said an aide to Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), one letter
signer. "These are issues that are very serious and may be more
appropriate with audiences of an older level that have a greater
emotional and intellectual capacity."</TE>
<TE>   After PBS' response, Johnson said the issue will be dropped. "It's
over as far as we're concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Although the matter at hand appears to have been settled, the
reaction underscores political friction regarding how to deal with
matters of sexual education and health--particularly in regard to
children--as well as past criticism of PBS for promoting what some
have characterized as a liberal agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats on the committee were still rallying to PBS' defense. "I
wouldn't be troubled if they did use [the character] in the U.S., and
I'm surprised some of these Republicans are making such a big fuss,"
said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). "There are going to be
millions of orphans around the world.... I just think it's a
misplaced priority for them to be focusing on 'Sesame Street' and its
attempt to have a character that will allow children to understand
that those that may have HIV or any other disability can live side by
side with other children."</TE>
<TE>   Waxman added that it was inappropriate for members of Congress to
get involved in "day-to-day decisions on content" of PBS shows. Rep.
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) also expressed support for PBS and "Sesame
Street," saying the show has "done much to educate our children and
demystify many of the social issues of our times."</TE>
<TE>   In her letter, Mitchell said PBS "has no relationship with Sesame
Workshop regarding its South African programming."</TE>
<TE>   She said the U.S. show receives $4.8 million in federal funds,
plus additional money from local PBS stations, some of which may be
public money. About $1.6 million from the show's product sales gets
reimbursed to PBS.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell added: "I understand that the [U.S. Agency for
International Development] contributed funding to the production of
'Takalani Sesame.' "</TE>
<TE>   Robert Knezevic, assistant vice president of international
co-productions at Sesame Workshop, said each country's co-production
does its own research and would have to decide independently about
the character.</TE>
<TE>   Sesame Workshop was initially reluctant to develop the character
for South Africa because it hadn't conducted appropriate research, he
said, but the production's partners--which include the South Africa
Department of Education, national broadcaster SABC, a corporate
sponsor and USAID--insisted that it would serve a need. "Takalani
Sesame" is targeted to a 3- to 7-year-old audience.</TE>
<TE>   About 20% of the adult population in South Africa is infected with
the AIDS virus, according to the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Altman, president of the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation,
which studies health issues in South Africa and the U.S., said the
South African Muppet could be helpful for young people "or a really
bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   "It depends entirely on how the concept is executed," he said,
suggesting that sexually explicit messages wouldn't be appropriate
but messages to help young viewers cope with growing up in a society
in which HIV and AIDS are rampant would be. "I would assume that the
people involved are sensible.... I wouldn't assume they are going to
use a Muppet to convey safe-sex messages to 3-year-olds."</TE>
<TE>   Sesame Workshop said the new female Muppet, which doesn't yet have
a name, will be used to deal with issues such as the
"de-stigmatization of people with HIV/AIDS" and coping with illness
and loss. The Muppet will debut Sept. 30.</TE>

<HD>Iverson Is Arraigned in Gun Case</HD>
<DH>Court: NBA's top scorer draws a throng in Philadelphia as
he pleads not guilty to 14 charges, including 4 felonies. He's free
on $10,000 bail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>He was booked at dawn and asked to surrender his belt and shoelaces.
He was fingerprinted. His tattoos were photographed. He was offered a
cheese sandwich.</LD>
<LD>   After those preliminaries, Allen Iverson, the NBA scoring leader
and darling of the hip-hop generation, spent the next 11 hours
Tuesday in police custody. A multimillionaire who lives in a gated
mansion, Iverson found himself charged with barging into an apartment
and threatening two men with a handgun July 3 while searching for his
wife.</LD>
<LD>   By 4 p.m., his baggy white T-shirt was drooping on his bony
shoulders and his cornrows were asunder as Iverson slouched and
listened to a bail commissioner over a closed-circuit TV hookup in
his holding cell. After a five-minute arraignment, he was a free man,
let loose on a $10,000 signature bail and ordered to appear in court
Monday.</LD>
<TE>   He uttered not a word, but his lawyer did. "The plea is a strong
and definite not guilty," said Richard Sprague, a formidable former
prosecutor in a gray suit, answering a 14-count charge sheet that
included four felonies.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters, fans and gawkers chased the man called "The Answer"
through a police parking lot, and Philadelphia's civic debate only
escalated. On radio talk shows and in letters to the editor, the
question of the week remained: Is Allen Iverson a pampered thug or a
family man unfairly demonized for taking his uncle to his cousin's
house to look for his wife?</TE>
<TE>   Iverson was certainly the only defendant among the accused drug
dealers and wife beaters in police custody who was allowed to wait
five days at home for his top-shelf lawyer to return from a European
vacation before turning himself in.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, 27, also nicknamed "A.I.," or "Bubba Chuck," is no
ordinary felony defendant, of course. Of all the great athletes who
have played in Philadelphia, he is arguably the one who has connected
most viscerally with fans--a tireless dynamo and a fearless scorer
who has lifted the Philadelphia 76ers out of mediocrity. He is also a
man with a rebellious streak that has prompted past clashes with the
law and soured his relationship with his coach.</TE>
<TE>   His surrender Tuesday was a climax to a five-day media siege
triggered by the announcement on July 11 that police intended to
charge Iverson with crimes that could total 70 years in prison. While
Iverson waited at his $2.4-million Main Line manse under virtual
house arrest, TV crews staked out the house.</TE>
<TE>   The crews tailed Iverson at 5 a.m. Tuesday to police headquarters
in Philadelphia, where he was driven through a rear garage to avoid
the press scrum in front. Police had promised that Iverson would be
treated like any other defendant, but ordinary miscreants are paraded
on foot through front entrances.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Iverson and his uncle Gregory forced their
way into the West Philadelphia apartment of Allen Iverson's cousin in
the early morning hours of July 3.</TE>
<TE>   The police have based their case on the statements of Charles
Jones, 21, a resident of the apartment who said Iverson threatened
him and a 17-year-old companion while displaying a gun in his
waistband.</TE>
<TE>   In a 911 call made 10 hours after the incident, according to a
transcript published by the Philadelphia Inquirer, Jones told police:
"When I woke up, Iverson was standing over me.... He was like,
'Where's my [expletive] wife at?' ... He had a gun on his hip. He was
sitting there threatening to shoot me."</TE>
<TE>   Jones also claimed that Iverson's cousin, Shaun Bowman, had told
him that Bowman was "hiding away" Iverson's wife, Tawanna, after
Allen "put her out of the house naked."</TE>
<TE>   Jones added: "It's like the third time he did it."</TE>
<TE>   The allure of a celebrity scandal stoked public and media interest
in a city bereft of A-list celebrities. The Iverson saga has been
front-page news, overshadowing the arrival of a new superintendent
for the city's troubled schools and the sudden dropping of murder
charges against four defendants in the killing of seven people in a
crack house.</TE>
<TE>   "I have people murdered in the streets of Philadelphia and I don't
see all of you here," Dist. Atty. Lynne Abraham told a horde of
reporters pursuing the most famous of the 80,000 city criminal
defendants processed annually.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia's beleaguered sports fans seem willing to forgive
Iverson's off-court behavior in deference to his electrifying
on-court skills. Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving and Charles Barkley
never consistently sold out the 76ers home arena. Only Iverson has.
The team says only two fans have canceled season ticket subscriptions
because of the Iverson scandal--and 15 new subscriptions have been
sold.</TE>
<TE>   Fans here can be brutal; they booed Santa Claus and cheered a
career-threatening spinal injury that left a Dallas Cowboys receiver
motionless on the Veterans Stadium turf. They hounded the aloof
Phillies Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt, yet adored profane outfielder
Lenny Dykstra and beer-bellied first baseman John Kruk.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson provides the energy and passion and hustle Philly fans
crave. With his do-rags and baggy clothes, he also appeals to the
hip-hop generation. His No. 3 jersey is the NBA's top seller, and his
contract with Reebok will pay him millions of dollars a year for the
rest of his playing career.</TE>
<TE>   Local defense lawyers say there is virtually no chance Iverson
will serve jail time, and they predict the case against him will
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is about as weak as it gets," said Brian McMonagle, a
former Philadelphia prosecutor who is now a criminal defense
attorney. "There's a serious proof problem here."</TE>
<TE>   Police have searched Iverson's home but have not found a gun. Nor
have they interviewed his wife. The entire case rests on Jones, who
McMonagle said is likely to be picked apart by a skilled lawyer
should the case ever go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   The affair has taken its toll on Sixers coach Larry Brown, who has
feuded with Iverson over the guard's lax practice habits and contempt
for authority.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, 61, wears the hounded look of a grandfather forced to stay
up all night with a rambunctious toddler.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Brown and the Sixers pledged to support their wayward
star. "He's a teammate and a friend, and we want to get this resolved
in the right way," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen A. Smith, a Philadelphia Inquirer sportswriter who has
covered Iverson, predicted that the Sixers will not trade or suspend
the league's 2000-01 most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   "He's box office," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the team may use Iverson's arrest to persuade him to
change his attitude and lifestyle. "They would never come out and say
it, but this essentially validates for them everything they've been
saying about Iverson: He's undisciplined, he doesn't respect
authority," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson is likely to be hauled before NBA Commissioner David Stern
for a lecture similar to the one Stern delivered last year, when
Iverson was about to release a rap album that disparaged homosexuals
and women. (Iverson and his wife have two children, and Iverson's
mother accompanies him to games.)</TE>
<TE>   The league's collective bargaining agreement requires a player
convicted of a violent felony to be suspended at least 10 days. Stern
could add more time; he suspended ex-Golden State guard Latrell
Sprewell 68 games for choking his coach.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA says no active player has been convicted of a felony.
Several have been charged with felonies, but the charges were either
dropped or reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson served four months in prison in 1993 for his part in a
bowling alley brawl in Virginia. He was later pardoned and his
conviction overturned.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Iverson received probation and was suspended for one game
after a pistol was found in a car in which he was a passenger.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson's top source of income--his Reebok contract--seems secure.
The firm issued a supportive statement: "It is Allen's celebrity
status, not the facts, that continues to fuel these proceedings."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, several marketing specialists said, the arrest might only
enhance Iverson's street props among the teenagers who buy his $125
"The Answer" sneakers.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Iverson received no special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   He posed for a mug shot, police Inspector Bill Colarulo said, and
his tattooed neck and arms were photographed as "identifiable
characteristics."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson was held in a secure room, away from other defendants, for
his own protection "so that someone doesn't try to make a name for
himself at Allen Iverson's expense," Colarulo said.</TE>
<TE>   When it was finally over, Iverson hopped into a green minivan. The
vehicle sped past the jugglers and lemonade stand set up by an
all-sports radio station and was trailed by news crews in vans and TV
helicopters overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Breathless news reports revealed that The Answer was heading to
his mansion, where photographers last week had emerged with evidence
of marital bliss. Their front-page photos showed Allen and Tawanna
chatting and smiling in the yard, like any other suburban couple.</TE>

<HD>Bush Plan on Clean Air Faces Attack in Senate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's plan to ease clean-air rules is undermining
enforcement cases against older coal-fired power plants, some
senators and state officials contended Tuesday. Federal officials
denied the charge.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a growing feeling, based on fact, that the
administration has sent a very clear signal that polluters can do so
with impunity," Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.)
said at a joint hearing of his committee and the Senate Environment
and Public Works Committee.</LD>
<LD>   New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, testified that the
Environmental Protection Agency's recent proposal to relax
enforcement rules under a Clean Air Act program has affected his
ability to negotiate settlements in cases against two major plants in
his state.</LD>
<TE>   "These policies, regulations, have had a devastating impact on our
ability to ensure the cleanliness of our air," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Justice Department and EPA told senators they
did not believe the proposal had undercut prosecution of cases
against major power plants.</TE>
<TE>   "We are committed to pursuing these cases," said Jeffrey
Holmstead, the EPA's assistant administrator in charge of the Office
of Air and Radiation.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the hearing, he was asked about how the proposal might
affect cases. Holmstead told reporters he would "be surprised if a
judge takes that into account."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the judge presiding over Spitzer's case in January has
asked for information on how the administration's proposal might
affect the issues in the case. The case accuses Niagara Mohawk and
NRG Energy Inc. of violations at two plants in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and the EPA have threatened heavy fines on
utilities unless they spend tens of billions of dollars to better
control emissions of acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide, smog-causing
nitrogen oxides and mercury.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Atty. Gen. Thomas L. Sansonetti, who oversees the
Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division,
described the regulatory proposals as "irrelevant" with regard to his
duty to prosecute.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going forward. I have no choice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sansonetti said he believes the proposals have yet to influence
the way companies approach talks.</TE>
<TE>   Vermont Atty. Gen. William H. Sorrell, a Democrat, said the EPA's
recommendations to President Bush "will seriously undercut" Vermont's
efforts to enforce existing pollution rules against utilities.</TE>
<TE>   But Alabama Atty. Gen. Bill Pryor, a Republican, said he supports
Bush's efforts to change a broad program that critics contend treads
on states' prerogative.</TE>

<HD>House Approves Tough Business Reform Measure</HD>
<DH>Congress: The bill contains stiff criminal sanctions and
indicates final legislation will have such penalties for corporate
fraud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Continuing Capitol Hill's headlong rush to curb corporate corruption,
the Republican-controlled House on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved
stiff new criminal penalties for securities fraud and other
misconduct by business executives.</LD>
<LD>   The 391-28 vote for the legislation marked an abrupt shift from
just a few months ago, when the House passed a corporate reform bill
without such penalties. The switch is the latest example of a kind of
anti-corporate bidding war that has broken out between the two
political parties in response to a new cascade of business scandals.</LD>
<LD>   The House vote also vastly increases the chances that the final
version of corporate reform legislation that emerges from
House-Senate negotiations will contain new criminal penalties for
corporate fraud. Those negotiations are set to begin soon. The Senate
voted unanimously Monday for a corporate reform bill that includes
stiffer anti-fraud penalties.</LD>
<TE>   Like the Senate bill, the measure passed by the House would make
securities fraud a federal crime, strengthen laws against document
shredding and require corporate executives to certify the accuracy of
financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is a tough bill,'' said Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.
(R-Wis.). ''It's going to put people in jail for a long, long time.''</TE>
<TE>   Even as House Democrats joined in backing the bill, they derided
the motives of Republicans, saying their GOP colleagues were simply
playing catch-up on an issue that is sweeping the political
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   ''This Republican majority ... is looking for a legislative
get-well card, as if they are now converted to protecting the
investor,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has urged Congress to help restore investors' shaky
confidence in corporate leaders by finishing work before its August
recess on broad legislation to crack down on accounting shenanigans
and other corporate wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   In another sign that the GOP is feeling pressure to move quickly,
some House Republicans are urging their leaders to simply accept the
Senate bill and dispense with conference negotiations. GOP Reps. Mark
Foley of Florida and Mike Rogers of Michigan are circulating a letter
among Republicans making that request of House Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Hastert rejected that proposal but said GOP
leaders hope to begin House-Senate talks as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The version of the corporate reform bill approved by the House in
April included no provisions to stiffen penalties for corporate
fraud. But since then, the emergence of new corporate scandals,
especially the accounting problems admitted by WorldCom Inc., created
political pressure for tougher legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The new House measure would raise to 20 years the maximum prison
sentences for wire and mail fraud. The Senate bill calls for a
10-year sentence, which is double the existing penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Under the House bill, the new crime of securities fraud, which
prosecutors say will make it easier to press cases against business
executives, would carry a maximum jail sentence of 25 years. The
Senate bill calls for a 10-year term.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill also would, for the first time, establish criminal
penalties for retaliation against a corporate whistle-blower. The
Senate bill would let whistle-blowers seek a civil remedy in court.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill came to the floor with little advance notice and
was whisked through on fast-track procedures that limited debate and
barred any amendments. Democrats responded with complaints that the
measure was being ramrodded through without their input.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) said to Republicans: ''You're
trying to jump on the bandwagon at the last minute when you should
have been there a long time ago.''</TE>
<TE>   In bringing the bill to the floor, Sensenbrenner invoked the
litany of corporate abuse.</TE>
<TE>   ''It appears that for some in corporate America the incentives for
fraud and ill-begotten gain outweigh the consequences if caught,'' he
said. ''Well, maybe the potential penalties for these crimes are just
not strong enough. Today it is our duty to fix that.''</TE>

<HD>Bush Sets Security Strategy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Tuesday unveiled the government's first blueprint
to protect the American homeland against terrorists--"a comprehensive
national strategy" that would employ high-tech wizardry and revamp
the federal bureaucracy to help the country better defend itself
against "the true threats of the 21st century."</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, state-of-the-art sensors would be deployed to
detect nuclear and biological threats, and "red teams" of covert
agents would analyze America's defenses from a terrorist's
perspective to pinpoint weaknesses.</LD>
<LD>   All states also would follow a minimum standard for issuing
driver's licenses to prevent terrorists from exploiting differing
regulations. (In Virginia, for example, until shortly after Sept. 11
an applicant could get a license merely by having another person
vouch for his or her home address; Florida had no residency
requirement at all.)</LD>
<TE>   The anti-terrorist capabilities of agencies from the FBI to the
Coast Guard also would be beefed up.</TE>
<TE>   The "National Strategy for Homeland Security" also calls for a
detailed review of critical infrastructure--such as the nation's
energy, water, agriculture, finance and telecommunications
sectors--and a meticulous plan to safeguard such facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was drawn up by the White House Office of Homeland
Security, headed by Tom Ridge. Some of the changes can be
accomplished administratively, while others will require
congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   In a sobering warning to the private sector--already reeling from
an economic downturn, a declining stock market and a spate of
corporate scandals--Bush's blueprint cautioned that security spending
by businesses could double from the pre-September tab of $55 billion
a year. The federal government's expense for homeland security is
also rising, to $38 billion under Bush's proposed fiscal 2003 budget
from $29 billion now.</TE>
<TE>   Under the blueprint, Washington stands to gain significant new
powers, from establishing a network of national laboratories to study
anti-terrorist techniques to giving the president broad authority to
reorganize the government without explicit congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush made no mention of that as he formally presented his plan
during brief remarks in the Rose Garden, with key lawmakers of both
parties behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "Protecting Americans from attack is our most urgent national
priority, and we must act on the priority," the president declared.</TE>
<TE>   He also warned that this was "an exceedingly complex mission."</TE>
<TE>   The 76-page plan represents an unprecedented effort to ensure
greater security from terrorist attacks, a broad step beyond such
post-Sept. 11 actions as stockpiling medicines and improving aviation
security.</TE>
<TE>   In issuing the report, Bush reminded the public that America
remains "a nation at risk to a new and changing threat."</TE>
<TE>   The blueprint is organized around Bush's June 6 proposal to create
a Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security, drawing under one
roof nearly 170,000 employees from 22 agencies scattered throughout
the government.</TE>
<TE>   An example would be changing the rules that now limit the use of
U.S. troops for homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush plan mentioned three circumstances under which troops
could be used: in combat air patrols and maritime defense; in
response to attacks; and in "limited scope" missions led by other
agencies, such as the recent Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Federal statutes now prohibit military personnel from enforcing
the law within the United States, except as expressly authorized by
the Constitution or an act of Congress. (For example, Navy ships have
been used in the effort to interdict drug smugglers, with Coast Guard
personnel on board to perform the law enforcement functions.)
However, the Bush report states, "[t]he threat of catastrophic
terrorism requires a thorough review of the laws permitting the
military to act within the United States in order to determine
whether domestic preparedness and response efforts would benefit from
greater involvement of military personnel and, if so, how."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he would not object to reviewing the "Posse
Comitatus" law, which dates to 1878. But he cautioned: "We've done
very well by separating the military from law enforcement. There
would be a heavy burden for those who want to change" that.</TE>
<TE>   However, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said a change in the
law restricting domestic military operations is "definitely worth
considering. I've been an advocate of the military having a more
active role in homeland defense."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, who is a leading sponsor of homeland security
legislation, and other lawmakers noted that many of the Bush
proposals are not new. For example, the blueprint released Tuesday
restated the administration's call for "smart borders" to identify
both potential terrorists and dangerous cargo at ports of entry,
while expediting the flow of legitimate travelers and goods. Among
the new tools the president seeks would be biometric technologies,
which could include identification through iris patterns or facial
measurements, to help verify the identity of foreign visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also identifies as "critical missions" such
responsibilities as tracking terrorists around the world, keeping
closer tabs on foreigners who enter the country legally and improving
communications among intelligence-gathering agencies and between
firefighters and rescue workers.</TE>
<TE>   In seeking more authority to reorganize the executive branch, Bush
is asking Congress to create the new department and grant him
executive powers to make such changes in the future without
congressional authorization.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the need for flexible presidential management
authority, Congress in 1932 passed legislation permitting the chief
executive to reorganize the executive branch to reduce expenditures
and increase efficiency. That authority lapsed in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   By releasing the blueprint, Bush was attempting to defuse
criticism that his administration is advocating the most significant
government reorganization in more than 50 years--since the creation
of the Defense Department and the CIA--without explaining in detail
why it is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a strategy now, and we've had a little bit of time to
study these things. That's important," said Sen. Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.), who is working with Lieberman on a Senate bill.</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) complained that the strategy
comes too late for lawmakers already immersed in the complex details
of reorganizing the government. Had it arrived before Bush's June 6
announcement, Menendez said, "the dialogue would have been much
better enriched."</TE>
<TE>   In his Rose Garden statement Tuesday, Bush expressed hope that
both the House and the Senate would take up his proposal before
leaving for their August vacation.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, a nine-member panel of House leaders continued
hearings aimed at developing compromise legislation for a House vote
next week.</TE>
<TE>   But after meeting with the president, lawmakers emerged less than
certain about the timetable for creating what would be the 15th
Cabinet department.</TE>
<TE>   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) said: "We'd like to have
it done by Sept. 11. However, we're not going to let haste get in the
way of getting a good piece of legislation."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The International Spy Museum, a privately funded effort to showcase
intelligence-gathering devices and the impact of espionage on
history, opens Friday just a block from FBI headquarters in downtown
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The 68,000-square-foot museum, in the works since 1996, touts
itself as the largest display of spy-related artifacts--ranging from
poison gas guns made by the Soviet KGB in the 1950s to the Enigma
cipher machine used by Germany in World War II.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not about celebrating espionage, it's about understanding
it," E. Peter Earnest, the museum's director who spent 36 years in
the Central Intelligence Agency, said. Spying "can mean the
difference between peace and war, between victory and defeat."</LD>
<TE>   Items on display at the museum include shoes with radio
transmitters in the soles, buttons that open to reveal a camera lens
and a tube of "lipstick" that can fire a bullet.</TE>

<HD>Collegians Unlikely to Ask Uncle Sam for Job</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite a surge in patriotism immediately after Sept. 11, more than
75% of college juniors and seniors say they would not consider a
career with Uncle Sam, according to a national poll released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "The students view the federal government as an old-fashioned,
bureaucratic and politicized work atmosphere that puts policies and
procedures ahead of people," said Mark J. Penn, the pollster who
directed a study of 1,000 students across the country.</LD>
<LD>   Idealism continues to hold sway, with teaching (87%) and work with
nonprofit agencies (84%) viewed most favorably by students as
careers. But only 22% of those polled said they were likely to become
teachers, and only 14% said they would join the nonprofit sector when
they graduate.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps reflecting the current concerns over corporate wrongdoing,
investment banking (64%) was near the bottom in terms of favorable
student perception, just above the law (60%).</TE>
<TE>   Favorable opinion of careers in the federal government (75%) and
the military (65%) was somewhat higher. Still, just 23% said they
would pursue government service, and only 4% said they would opt for
the military.</TE>
<TE>   The results suggest the next generation of soldiers, spies and
staffers may be hard to come by, in part because of the federal
government's cumbersome and lengthy hiring process.</TE>
<TE>   The 1.8-million-member civil service faces an employment crunch.
In the next five years, 45% of the federal government's senior
executives and 30% of staffers will retire, according to the
Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group focused on
recruiting and retaining top-quality civil servants.</TE>
<TE>   But to get these workers, the government must limber up its hiring
process, federal recruiters say. As the human resources director for
the Defense Logistics Agency, part of the Department of Defense, Jeff
Neal has seen job applications that run as long as 500 pages. "We're
going to people we want to work for the government and telling them,
'Write a novel,' " said Neal. "They don't want to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Neal has watched the federal job classification system expand over
20 years into a 2,000-item roster. The government takes an average of
81 days to make a hiring decision, but 69% of those polled said they
were unwilling to wait more than four weeks for a job offer. Almost
two-thirds of respondents said it was "difficult" to locate and apply
for jobs with the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Neal and Linda Bilmes, a former assistant Commerce secretary, plan
to use the poll results to write a book calling on the government to
overhaul its hiring practices. The study was conducted for Neal and
Bilmes by the Washington polling firm of Penn, Schoen and Berland
Associates. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage
points.</TE>
<TE>   Young adults have continuously expressed an interest in serving
their country, evidenced by the large numbers of students
volunteering while they are in college, said Paul C. Light, executive
director at the Brookings Institution Center for Public Service in
Washington. The problem is the hiring practices of the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   "We see talented young Americans who get government jobs are the
first to leave, because the jobs are so dreary, the opportunities for
advancement so poor and the number of angry, embittered and poor
performers in their midst so high," Light said. "So what young people
now are saying isn't 'Show us the money,' but 'Show us the work.' "</TE>

<HD>Study Cites Spy Agency Failures Leading Up to 9/11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's spy agencies devoted far too little money and manpower
to penetrating Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations before
Sept. 11, and they were in such short supply of translators and
skilled analysts that they couldn't make timely use of much of the
intelligence they did collect, according to sources familiar with a
report scheduled to be released today by a House Intelligence
subcommittee.</LD>
<LD>   The report is sharply critical of the CIA, the National Security
Agency and, to a lesser extent, the FBI for failings ranging from
woeful misallocation of resources to risk-averse bureaucratic
cultures that compromised the United States' counter-terrorism
efforts, according to a congressional source familiar with the
document.</LD>
<LD>   The report, titled "Counter Terror Intelligence Capabilities and
Performance Prior to 9/11," is the first formal assessment from a
congressional panel of intelligence failures leading up to the
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in September.</LD>
<TE>   The document was produced by a special House subcommittee on
terrorism that was created after the attacks. The panel spent much of
the last year conducting hearings and interviews with intelligence
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The document spans several hundred pages, most of it classified
material that will not be released to the public. But a 30-page
summary set for release today outlines the principal findings, and
makes recommendations calling for improvement in information sharing
among agencies, a stepped-up commitment to so-called human
intelligence--recruitment of spies--and shoring up of the NSA's
ability to translate the millions of electronic communications it
intercepts.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, an aide familiar with the document said that even if
every recommendation in the report had been put in place, "the
authors could not conclude that Sept. 11 could have been prevented."</TE>
<TE>   The ranking members of the subcommittee that produced the report
are Reps. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and Jane Harman (D-Venice).</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee's work is separate from a much larger
investigation of intelligence failures being conducted jointly by the
House and Senate intelligence committees. That ongoing
effort--scheduled to be completed by early next year--involves a
staff of about 30 investigators who are reviewing hundreds of
thousands of pages of documents obtained from the CIA, the FBI and
other agencies. The House subcommittee had no such access to agency
documents or investigative resources.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the subcommittee's findings are likely to be disputed by
top officials in the nation's spy community. In congressional
testimony earlier this year, CIA Director George J. Tenet insisted
that there was no intelligence failure leading up to Sept. 11, and he
and other top intelligence officials have said that they have been
pursuing Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations aggressively for
years.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee's report acknowledges that intelligence officials
had recognized Al Qaeda as an important target. In fact, it cites
notes from a meeting of intelligence officials three years before
last fall's deadly attacks in which the officials warn that unless
there were substantial improvements in the way counter-terrorism data
were collected and analyzed, a "catastrophic" attack on American soil
was all but inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   The officials involved in the meeting are not identified in the
report, the congressional source said.</TE>
<TE>   The inclusion of the impromptu minutes from that meeting was a
source of some partisan friction within the Republican-led panel,
with some Democrats concerned that it was included at least in part
to connect problems in the intelligence community back to the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   The report generally concludes that whatever improvements came of
that Sept. 11, 1998, meeting were inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   The report also makes mention of another classified document,
which warns that Osama bin Laden would probably pose a long-term
threat to the United States, as an example of the vague and therefore
relatively useless alarms that the intelligence community routinely
sounded.</TE>
<TE>   The report chastises intelligence agencies for devoting far too
much of their resources to padding agency bureaucracies at the
expense of collecting information.</TE>

<DH>Billions in new spending for homeland security inspire the
retooling of devices, from aerial whale drones to cargo snoopers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A year ago, the Navy gave Anthony Mulligan's company a small grant to
build a cheap aerial drone for whale watching. The idea was to make
sure marine mammals weren't around during sonar tests.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Sept. 11. And, with the help of an Arizona congressman,
Mulligan transformed the drone into a potential weapon in the new war
on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The congressman arranged for Mulligan to testify at a House
hearing, where he talked about flying entire squadrons of
whale-watching drones to spy on enemy territory or loading one with a
pound of C-4 explosives and ramming it, kamikaze-style, into an enemy
target.</LD>
<TE>   Though the drone had only been tested for whale watching off the
Hawaiian coast, Mulligan's company won the support of key Capitol
Hill politicians, a new $500,000 grant to ramp up his drone
production and the prospect for $5 million more to mass produce it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Navy is interested in buying tens of thousands of
them," Mulligan said.</TE>
<TE>   Mulligan's drone is one of hundreds of products being repackaged
as counter-terrorism devices and pitched to the federal government,
makeovers inspired by billions of dollars in new defense and homeland
security spending. Federal agencies have been papered with proposals.
More than 12,500 applications have flooded one little-known agency
that specializes in funding counter-terrorism research--more than 10
times the usual traffic.</TE>
<TE>   With competition fierce, companies with products in the pipeline
and political patrons on the Hill have an advantage in lining up
federal grants and contracts. Mulligan was among a select group
invited to showcase its products at the House Military Research and
Development Subcommittee hearing in March. Subcommittee aides said
the hearing was designed to bring in small, innovative manufacturers
who lack the clout and political war chests of America's
multinational defense contractors.</TE>
<TE>   One executive had artificial blood, not yet approved by the
federal government, that he said could save lives on the battlefield
or in terrorist attacks. A cargo inspection machine, previously
rejected by government agencies as too big, costly and slow, got a
second look as an anti-terrorism device.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a market moving to serve a need," said Richard Hollis,
another hearing participant, who is developing a radiation protection
drug for the military with technology that originally targeted AIDS
and hepatitis. "When there is a need, the beauty of our system is
that companies will move to fill that need."</TE>
<TE>   When Congress throws billions of dollars at a new effort like
homeland security, the response from America's revenue-seeking
marketplace is predictable, said John Pike of globalsecurity.org, an
independent defense policy group in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "No leap of the imagination is required to guess the result," he
said. "For Congress, that's like hanging out a sign that says, 'Free
money.' "</TE>
<TE>   Mulligan, however, said he's driven by patriotism rather than
profit.</TE>
<TE>   "In reality," he said, "if these drones get the bad guys, it would
be worth the entire company."</TE>
<TE>   From Whales to War</TE>
<TE>   The relatively brief history of Mulligan's counter-terrorism entry
is not without irony.</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year-old Tucson entrepreneur had scored some early
successes in his career, making and marketing products for the
disabled, then an unusual line of dog seat-belts, poop scoopers and
chew toys for Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   Mulligan had set up Advanced Ceramics Research with a Defense
Department grant that he has parlayed into a new generation of earth
penetrators and fighter jet components. He won millions of dollars in
federal military contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Then in the fall of 2000, Mulligan recalled, a scientist at the
U.S. Naval Weapons Center had asked if his company could develop an
unmanned craft for counter-terrorism--"to fly around a Navy ship and
prevent a USS Cole-type disaster," Mulligan said, citing the October
2000 terrorist bombing of the American warship in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no money to fund it.</TE>
<TE>   "Before 9/11, there wasn't that much interest in
counter-terrorism, even within the military," Mulligan explained.
"The earth wasn't shaking for terrorism. The earth was shaking for
whales."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Office of Naval Research "had a very pressing need
to locate whales and other marine animals before they do their Navy
testing," Mulligan said, and that's what the drones were designed to
do when the Navy ordered one last July.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the first prototype was doing just that--watching for
whales off Hawaii--the week before Mulligan sat before the House
Military Research and Development Subcommittee to pitch his modules
as unique, affordable and disposable weapons in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The company's local congressman, Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz), had
introduced Mulligan to key staff members of the Armed Services
Committee, who then secured his slot on the subcommittee's March 12
agenda, Mulligan recalled. Federal election records show that
Mulligan and other Advanced Ceramics employees have given nearly
$10,000 to Kolbe's campaign fund in the last couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   And when Mulligan unveiled his firstprototype in the packed
subcommittee hearing room, it was an instant hit.</TE>
<TE>   Mulligan conceded to the subcommittee members that his drones had
never been tested for combat. At top speed, they lumbered along at 60
mph--sufficient for whale watching but no match for antiaircraft
guns. And researchers had never tried to fly them longer than 45
minutes at a time, although Mulligan told the committee that his
projections indicated that the unmanned aircraft is capable of flying
up to 30 hours without a refueling stop.</TE>
<TE>   "You said you build this drone, this little unmanned aerial
vehicle, for 2,000 bucks?" asked one subcommittee member who was
unidentified in the hearing transcript.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Mulligan replied. "We believe that when we start producing
them that it'll actually be $2,000 or less."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we're all pretty hot on this, obviously, the unmanned
aerial vehicle idea in the wake of the Predator performance and
Global Hawk coming on line now," said Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine),
the subcommittee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to the recent successes of CIA-bought drones
during the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. Those drones travel
long distances at twice the speed and altitude and cost several
million dollars apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter called Mulligan's drones "transformational," citing their
low-cost, high-volume battlefield potential.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing, Mulligan said in a recent interview, was "the
pinnacle of my career."</TE>
<TE>   The Army Aviation Technology Directorate requested a prototype
from Mulligan to feature at a military drone convention in May in
Nashville. And that's just the beginning. In a recent interview,
Mulligan said the Navy's $500,000 grant came through in May to
produce a squadron of whale-watching drones. He credited Kolbe and
Hunter for including $5 million more in the defense authorization
bill to begin mass producing counter-terrorism drones.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's up to the Senate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Battlefield Blood</TE>
<TE>   Another apparent early winner in the post-attack marketplace is
Biopure Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Rausch, company co-founder and chief technology officer,
cited the anthrax poisonings and the Afghanistan war in a recent
Capitol Hill appeal for federal money to research military uses for
Biopure's experimental blood substitute, which uses cow blood as its
basic ingredient.</TE>
<TE>   The product has been in development since 1984, when AIDS rather
than terrorism dominated front pages and fears of tainted blood
supplies ran higher than those of tainted mail.</TE>
<TE>   After 18 years, a $345-million deficit and a recent rash of
shareholder lawsuits, the company has yet to market its product,
Hemopure, according to Biopure's filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The stockholder suits accuse Biopure of securities fraud and
assert that the company's failure to apply for a Food and Drug
Administration license for Hemopure by its own Dec. 31, 2001,
deadline drove down its stock price and raised questions about the
reliability of the company's clinical trials. So far the blood
substitute has been approved for sale only by the government of South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has filed to dismiss the lawsuits, said the
charges are "without merit."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials say that they plan to apply for an FDA license
before the end of July to sell the product in the U.S. as a blood
substitute for elective orthopedic surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The quest for artificial blood has confounded centuries of
science. For decades, the world's largest drug companies have tried
to produce a blood substitute. The U.S. military has spent more than
$100 million on the effort.</TE>
<TE>   But Rausch insists Biopure has found the key, and the company's
efforts received a big boost after Rausch appeared before Hunter's
subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Rausch's sponsor at the hearing was Rep. John M. Spratt Jr.
(D-S.C.), a subcommittee member. Spratt was sponsoring a $7-million
military research grant for Biopure, which has pledged to build a
factory to manufacture the artificial blood in Spratt's district.</TE>
<TE>   Rausch testified that his company's blood substitute could provide
lifesaving first aid on battlefields and at terrorism scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter called the product "great-looking stuff," again offering a
personal endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   "And you could put that, literally, in your combat pack," Hunter
said. "And you could carry that in the field, and when you get fired
up, you get some blood loss, your medic or your colleagues there in
your fire team or your squad can give you some blood. And it doesn't
have any of these preservation requirements that regular blood has."</TE>
<TE>   "You want to give this [presentation] for me?" Rausch asked
Hunter. "It's great!"</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the cost, Rausch noted Hemopure's price tag would
be from $500 to $1,000 a unit--5 to 10 times that of real blood,
which is now considered far safer, less expensive and more readily
available than it was in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   The comparison did little to dampen enthusiasm. The subcommittee
members subsequently signed off on a defense authorization bill that
included full funding for Biopure's $7-million military trauma study.
The House Armed Services committee approved the bill in May.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing may also have given a boost to Biopure's efforts to
raise new capital. Rausch's testimony took place one day after
Biopure filed with the SEC to sell up to $30 million worth of stock.
Company officials say the timing was completely coincidental. The
company completed its stock sale in late April.</TE>
<TE>   Super-Sized Snooper</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, the federal government had sunk more than $35
million into development of the Ancore Cargo Inspector, mostly in the
name of the war on drugs.</TE>
<TE>   And, for more than a decade, Tsahi Gozani and his team of
scientists in California's Silicon Valley used the money to design
the Superman of drug enforcement on the United States' borders: a
machine that could instantly see anything, inside anything, hidden on
board the millions of trucks and ships that enter America every year.</TE>
<TE>   But when Ancore unveiled its product in the 1990s, the federal
agencies that had funded it mainly for narcotics detection flatly
rejected it. They wouldn't even pay for a testing site for an Ancore
prototype.</TE>
<TE>   At $10 million apiece, the inspection machines were too costly.
The size of a carwash, they took up far more space than most U.S.
border crossings and seaports could afford. And they were just as
slow as the lower-tech X-ray-based machines already in use, the
agencies said.</TE>
<TE>   What is more, a report by the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, quoted from Defense and Treasury Department
findings in 1998 that the machine also had "detection limitations
regarding other contraband, such as explosives, nuclear weapons and
materials and chemical agents."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Silvestre Reyes (D-Texas) interceded on Ancore's behalf. He
said he was so impressed with the machine during a 1999 tour of
Ancore that he had strongly supported a test site in his El Paso
district ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The California company has also supported Reyes since 2000, with
$3,500 in campaign contributions from corporate officers and
representatives, federal election records show.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes said his Ancore visit convinced him that the machine "has
the ability to dramatically change the way we enforce our immigration
and drug laws and facilitate trade and commerce along the border."</TE>
<TE>   Ancore's proponents finally tasted success on Sept. 12, when the
Federal Aviation Administration agreed to pay up to $23 million to
build and install a machine at an air cargo facility that has yet to
be named.</TE>
<TE>   The contract was in the works before the Sept. 11 attacks, Ancore
officials said. But after the attacks, Ancore promoted the machine as
"the newest weapon in our war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   And on March 12, the Customs Service finally signed off on a
$5-million commitment to install the Ancore Cargo Inspector at a
border test site. The same day, Gozani was among the select group
that testified at Hunter's subcommittee hearing, in an appearance
arranged by Reyes, a subcommittee member.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes repeated his endorsement during Gozani's hearing testimony
in March.</TE>
<TE>   Subcommittee Chairman Hunter sounded persuaded. He called the
machine a "magnificent breakthrough." And, whether unaware of the
GAO's previous findings or undeterred by them, Hunter pledged to
support the purchase of dozens more of the machines.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to buy a couple billion dollars worth of these from
you," Hunter said. "You won't hold that against us, will you?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Gozani said. "Absolutely not."</TE>
<TE>   In mid-June, the Pentagon, which along with the Customs Service
had rejected the machine in the late 1990s, committed an additional
$5 million to install the Ancore test bed, most likely at the
original El Paso border crossing.</TE>
<TE>   In recent interviews, company officials cited Sept. 11, Reyes'
support and the hearing for their newfound success.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier approval had been stalled by the federal government's
"typical reluctance to be the first adopter of new technologies,"
Gozani said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nine-eleven changed everything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the machine's alleged shortcomings in explosives detection,
Ancore Chief Operating Officer Patrick Shea said that the initial
tests the GAO cited were to measure the cargo inspector's
drug-detection capability and that the machine is being recalibrated
to better display the presence of nuclear, chemical and conventional
weapons as well.</TE>
<TE>   Shea added that, after last year's terrorist attacks, "there was a
realization that we do have people trying to blow us up. Certainly,
customs has changed its mind, to the extent that they're now willing
to put up money for it."</TE>

<HD>Traficant Rails at Expulsion Hearing</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Ohio Democrat, guilty of corruption, may face
a rare House eviction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Insisting on his innocence, Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. on Tuesday
loudly and defiantly told a House panel considering whether to
recommend his expulsion that the U.S. government railroaded him into
a bribery, fraud and tax evasion conviction.</LD>
<LD>   "I have enough sense to realize what's going on," Traficant
shouted from behind a table where he sat alone, fighting the
possibility of becoming only the second House member since the Civil
War to be kicked out.</LD>
<LD>   "They railroaded the hell out of me, and they're doing it to
millions of people around the country and the country's fed up with
it."</LD>
<TE>   Traficant, an Ohio Democrat, was convicted in April of taking
kickbacks from employees and soliciting bribes and other gifts from
businessmen. During a nine-week trial in Cleveland, Traficant also
defended himself without a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have recommended he serve at least seven years in
prison for taking kickbacks from staffers and bribes from
businessmen. Sentencing is set for July 30.</TE>
<TE>   Answering questions for the first time on the charges, the
61-year-old Traficant insisted that all of the witnesses in the
criminal trial lied and were forced to do so under threat of reprisal
by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-term lawmaker has complained about a government vendetta
since he beat the FBI in a bribery case in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   During exchanges with the House ethics committee, Traficant denied
that ex-staff member Allen Sinclair gave him $2,500 in cash each
month, as Sinclair testified.</TE>
<TE>   House rules require an ethics panel investigation when a lawmaker
is convicted of a felony.</TE>
<TE>   Expulsion has befallen only one member since the Civil War: Rep.
Michael Myers (D-Pa.), who in 1980 accepted money from undercover FBI
agents.</TE>

<HD>Transforming a Symbol of Tragedy</HD>
<DH>Recovery: New Yorkers are given six designs for a rebuilt
World Trade Center site to consider. But obstacles litter the path to
completion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It may be years before the World Trade Center is fully reconstructed,
but the long, contentious process of approving a final design took a
big step forward Tuesday, as planning officials unveiled six possible
designs for the 16-acre site.</LD>
<LD>   Although the conceptual schemes differ in major respects--some
calling for huge office buildings, others devoting much of the area
to grassy open space--each one provides ample room for a memorial to
the 2,823 people killed here in the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "The question is not whether we will rebuild on this site, but
how," said John Whitehead, chairman of the Lower Manhattan
Development Corp., at a news conference held in Federal Hall on Wall
Street. "What we all agree on is that there be fitting remembrance
for those who died. But there is no need to rush. It is desirable not
to move too fast."</LD>
<TE>   Given the timetable--and the notoriously slow pace of most major
development in New York--there is little danger of that happening.
Following Tuesday's unveiling, officials have scheduled what is
expected to be one of the largest public hearings in city history
Saturday at the Jacob Javits Convention Center, where more than 5,000
people are expected to voice opinions on the plans.</TE>
<TE>   "We think of today's event and the weekend public hearing as the
very beginning, a point to start a truly important dialogue," said
Julie Menin, founder of Wall Street Rising, a nonprofit group trying
to spur economic development and tourism in Lower Manhattan. "Nobody
knows what's going to finally take shape at the site, but we're going
to press our concerns, because we've got quite a few, and I'm sure
thousands of other people in this city and around the country will be
doing the same."</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the extraordinary range of ideas expressed so far,
there are bound to be debates over the proposals to build clusters of
60- to 80-story buildings on the site, the tallest of which are
topped off with sculptures or radio antennae for a "signature" effect
on the skyline. Other ideas, such as the creation of a pedestrian
promenade that would rival Washington's National Mall in size, are
also likely to draw intense public comment.</TE>
<TE>   The next step, Whitehead said, will be to winnow the six
development concepts to three in September. If the schedule continues
as planned, a final design would be tentatively approved by planning
officials in late December.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even that proposal, which is expected to incorporate major
elements of the six plans unveiled Tuesday, could be subject to major
revision and change. Although the ideas presented this week ideally
contain the DNA of a final plan, the blueprint could be altered at
any time, Whitehead noted.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, whatever finally rises at the World Trade Center site will
be subject to approval by the governors of New York and New Jersey,
the legislatures of both states, the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey, which owns the devastated site, plus the mayor of New
York and myriad city planning and transportation agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Any one of these public officials or agencies could derail the
planning process. Last weekend, for example, New York Mayor Michael
R. Bloomberg got a sneak preview of the six proposals and said he
wasn't thrilled with any of them, adding: "New Yorkers have a lot of
different ideas as to what should be built here."</TE>
<TE>   The plans can be reviewed on a Web site, www.RenewNYC.com, and
will be on public display beginning next week. Despite their
differences, they agree on several points: Each proposal calls for a
memorial and the reconstruction of 11 million square feet of
commercial office space, a 600,000-square-foot hotel and 600,000
square feet of retail space, all of which were lost in the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The plans also call for a massive underground transit terminal for
Lower Manhattan, a facility on the scale of Grand Central Station
that would link subway and bus lines, commuter rail and ferry transit
in a hub stretching from New Jersey and the Hudson River on the west
to the East River, Brooklyn and Long Island in the east.</TE>
<TE>   None of the proposals, which were illustrated in elaborate
sketches and also laid out in three-dimensional models, calls for
buildings equal in size to the twin 110-story towers that were
destroyed. The highest building in any of the plans would be 85
stories.</TE>
<TE>   Few here believed that tenants would want to relocate in exact
replicas of the doomed buildings, but beyond that the ideas for
rebuilding ground zero roam far and wide over what has become deeply
emotional terrain.</TE>
<TE>   Some victims' families, backed by former Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, said there should be no development whatsoever on the site,
viewing it as sacred ground akin to Gettysburg or Pearl Harbor. But
all six proposals call for major commercial development, and two
ignore family members' wishes that no new buildings arise on the
one-acre sites, or footprints, where each of the twin towers stood.</TE>
<TE>   Monika Iken, who founded September's Mission, a family and
victims' advocacy group, has said repeatedly that "there are a great
many shareholders" when it comes to redesigning ground zero,
including victims' families, rescue workers, residents and small
businesses. But there are also major economic players, such as
developer Larry Silverstein, who signed a $3.4-billion, 99-year lease
to operate the World Trade Center towers shortly before they were
destroyed, along with Westfield America, which leased retail space at
the World Trade Center, and Marriott Hotels, which operated a hotel
at the site.</TE>
<TE>   The Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which was formed after the
terrorist attacks, drew up the six proposals in concert with Beyer
Blinder Belle, a New York architectural and planning firm that has
worked on major public projects such as the restorations of Grand
Central Terminal, Ellis Island and Governors Island.</TE>
<TE>   A key goal was to ensure that any development at the World Trade
Center "has a position of importance and makes an architectural
statement in the restoration of the city's skyline," said John H.
Beyer, founding partner of the architectural firm. To that end, he
noted, each of the plans calls for at least one dominant building
that would replace the twin towers' place in the downtown Manhattan
skyline.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that President Bush committed $20 billion to the
reconstruction of Lower Manhattan, Whitehead chided those who think
the pace of development so far is too slow.</TE>
<TE>   "We have tremendous resources to get the work done, but the site
is enormous," he said. "It's interesting that we've already got one
large building [World Trade Center 7] being rebuilt and we've started
the reconstruction of two damaged subway lines, and yet some people
don't think anything is going on."</TE>

<TE>   Manhattan's Proposed Skyline of the Future</TE>
<TE>   New York City planning officials unveiled six conceptual schemes
for the 16-acre World Trade Center site. None of the planned
buildings will rise as high as the 1,350-foot twin towers did, but
each design has at least one skyscraper. Highlights of the six plans:</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Plaza</TE>
<TE>   The site includes a 79-story tower topped with an antenna or
sculpture on the northwest corner, a memorial and cultural buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Promenade</TE>
<TE>   Museum/cultural facilities and a large oval park are connected by
a promenade to Battery Park, allowing views of the Statue of Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Square</TE>
<TE>   An 80-story tower would be marked with an antenna. Rooftop gardens
and a public walkway surround and overlook the square.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Triangle</TE>
<TE>   An 85-story tower is surrounded by a 61-story tower and four
59-story towers. The plan includes a 5-acre triangular open space.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Garden</TE>
<TE>   An 80-story tower would have an antenna or sculptural top and
overlook the open space. Memorial/cultural facilities occupy the
southwest corner.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Park</TE>
<TE>   Two 72-story towers and three 45-story buildings sit partially on
the footprints of the original towers. A six-acre park is partially
on a deck.</TE>

<HD>More Risk Shown in Use of Estrogen</HD>
<DH>Health: New study finds long-term application of
replacement therapy increases a woman's chances of getting ovarian
cancer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The drumbeat of bad news about estrogen replacement therapy continues
today with the release of a new study showing that long-term use of
estrogen increases the risk of ovarian cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, smaller studies of such a link had shown mixed results
and an American Cancer Society study last year showed that long-term
estrogen use increased the risk of dying from ovarian cancer. The new
National Cancer Institute study shows that the increased risk of
contracting the disease is real and substantial--an 80% increase in
risk for women who have used estrogen for at least 10 years and a
220% higher risk for those who have used it at least 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   Both studies were epidemiological applications, however, not the
randomized clinical trials that are considered the gold standard for
determining risks and benefits of drugs.</LD>
<TE>   The latest study did not show an increased risk among women using
a combination of estrogen and progestin, but study author James V.
Lacey Jr. cautioned that there were too few women in the research
using the combination for conclusive results. "There simply aren't
enough data to say whether taking the combined therapy has any effect
on ovarian cancer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our results don't change the message that we have been hearing
for the past week," Lacey said. "If anything, they reiterate it.
Women should talk to their health-care providers before making any
decisions about hormone replacement therapy."</TE>
<TE>   The balance in decision-making is turning away from long-term
estrogen use, said Dr. Kenneth L. Noller of Tufts University and the
New England Medical Center, who wrote an editorial about the new
report in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Estrogen replacement therapy certainly is not the panacea it once
appeared," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Wulf H. Utian, executive director of the North American
Menopause Society, however, said that "women should not be
particularly concerned" about the new findings. "Of the women
starting hormone replacement therapy, 75% have stopped within 24
months, so the number taking it beyond 10 years is really quite a
small number," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The new study comes a week after doctors reported early results
from the Women's Health Initiative, a major research effort in which
16,608 post-menopausal women were randomly assigned to take either a
combination of estrogen and progestin, or a placebo. That study was
terminated early when it became clear that women taking the hormones
had an increased risk for breast cancer, blood clots, strokes and
heart attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Howard Judd of Olive View-UCLA Medical Center noted that
observational studies similar to today's report had concluded that
hormone replacement therapy reduced the risk of heart attack and
strokes. It took a controlled clinical trial like the Women's Health
Initiative to show that the therapy did not provide protection.</TE>
<TE>   Judd noted that the Women's Health Initiative is also examining
the risks of ovarian cancer and would probably issue a report in a
few months. "If I were going to put this in perspective, I would say
that the risks [reported in today's study] are modest and we
anxiously await the results of randomized drug trials to address this
issue. That is why the Women's Health Initiative is so important."</TE>
<TE>   Hormone replacement therapy is used by about 13.5 million women in
the United States. Just under 8 million use estrogen alone and the
rest use a combination of estrogen and progestin. Estrogen alone is
typically given only to women who have undergone hysterectomies
because the drug increases the risk of uterine cancer about
eightfold. Studies have shown that, for women with intact uteruses,
adding progestin reduces the risk of uterine tumors.</TE>
<TE>   Hormone replacement therapy is used primarily to reduce the
symptoms of menopause--such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness--and
to reduce the risk of osteoporosis. In recent years, however,
physicians have expanded its use because of the belief that it
protects against heart disease and a variety of other problems of
aging. In the new study, Lacey and his colleagues followed 44,241
post-menopausal women for an average of about 20 years. They
identified 329 women who developed ovarian cancer during that period.</TE>
<TE>   They concluded that, overall, women who had used estrogen had a
60% increased risk. Those who used it for 10 to 19 years had an 80%
increased risk, while those who used it for 20 or more years had a
220% increased risk.</TE>
<TE>   Those results were similar to conclusions reached in last year's
study by Dr. Carmen Rodriguez and her colleagues at the American
Cancer Society. The Rodriguez study found that using estrogen for 10
years or longer doubled the risk of dying from ovarian cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Experts cautioned that the absolute risk was still low. Ovarian
cancer is relatively rare, striking an estimated 23,000 U.S. women
each year and killing 14,000.</TE>
<TE>   "If our results are true, they would translated to one to two
additional cases of ovarian cancer in a group of 10,000 women taking
estrogen for a year," Lacey said.</TE>
