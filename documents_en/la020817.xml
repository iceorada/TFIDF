<HD>'Anna Nicole' Is Renewing a Family Feud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The legal battle between former Playboy centerfold Anna Nicole Smith
and her late oil tycoon husband's son hasn't always been solely over
his money. Early on, it also involved the body the Texas billionaire
left behind.</LD>
<LD>   A judge in 1995 ruled that J. Howard Marshall's cremated remains
should be split evenly between the warring parties, a Solomon-like
decision that seemingly put the issue to rest.</LD>
<LD>   If only it were that simple.</LD>
<TE>   Last Sunday, an urn containing half of Marshall's ashes made an
appearance on cable television's "The Anna Nicole Show"--getting a
tour of his widow's San Fernando Valley home and finding eternal rest
atop her TV.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the fireplace. See?" Smith said, holding back tears as
she cradled a box containing Marshall's urn. "This is the kitchen.
Food. I have money now."</TE>
<TE>   It was a guest spot that is making the keeper of Marshall's other
half angry enough to consider yet another lawsuit for slander and has
ignited a new war of words between Marshall's son and widow.</TE>
<TE>   "We watched it in disgust," said David Margulies, a spokesman for
E. Pierce Marshall, who has been fighting Smith in court for seven
years over his father's estate. "It was so insensitive, so
outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   In March, a federal judge in Santa Ana awarded Smith nearly $89
million from her late husband's estate, finding that the 34-year-old
former stripper loved the 90-year-old businessman during their 14
months of marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has yet to see a dime. A Texas probate court earlier ruled
the younger Marshall is the sole heir to his father's fortune.
Appeals are pending, and the case could end up in the U.S. Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   But not before Smith's "reality TV" series makes its mark on the
unreal made-for-the-tabloids case.</TE>
<TE>   The "Anna Nicole Show" has been a hit for E! Entertainment. The
show's debut this month garnered the cable network its highest rating
ever. Although the second week's ratings were down noticeably, it is
still a big ratings boost for E! A network spokeswoman wouldn't
comment on the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The show's premise is simple: Smith is followed around by a camera
crew. She eats. She runs errands. She squeezes her ample body into
tight-fitting clothes. She mumbles incoherently.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's co-stars include her Prozac-eating poodle, 16-year-old son
Daniel and personal assistant. Often by her side is Marina del Rey
attorney Howard K. Stern, who, with a smear of lipstick on his face,
accompanied Smith as she carried Marshall's ashes from room to room
on Sunday's show.</TE>
<TE>   The show's debut has launched a new war of words between son and
former stepmother that may well end up as part of their long-running
case.</TE>
<TE>   Said Marshall in a statement: "I think the public will conclude
that this plus-sized model and her lipstick-covered attorney don't
have an ounce of decency or credibility between them."</TE>
<TE>   Shot back Stern, also in a statement: "E. Pierce should just pay
the money he owes, mind his own business and let Anna Nicole move on
with her life. Nobody forces E. Pierce or his publicist to watch the
show, and their childish outbursts and name-calling only add fuel to
the fire."</TE>

<HD>Dance Festival Calling It Quits</HD>
<DH>The Arts* Unable to find a new artistic director, Dance
Kaleidoscope is being dissolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 13 years of presenting an annual citywide summer dance
festival, the board of directors of Dance Kaleidoscope has decided to
dissolve the organization.</LD>
<LD>   Dance Kaleidoscope will donate the $5,000 remaining in its coffers
to Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Werbel, one of Dance Kaleidoscope's three current board
members, said that the organization decided to fold because
discussions with local arts groups failed to lead to a suitable
replacement for artistic director Don Hewitt, 66, who stepped down
approximately a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Although Hewitt received a small stipend for his work, he was not
paid a salary. He supported himself with teaching posts and other
activities. Hewitt, who has moved to Portland, Ore., and Werbel said
it would be impossible to find a new director without offering a
competitive salary.</TE>
<TE>   Werbel said that the festival's annual production expenses, about
$90,000, were covered by funding from the Los Angeles Cultural
Affairs Department, the Los Angeles County Arts Commission and
California Arts Council, ticket sales and individual and corporate
donations. According to Hewitt, during his 13-year tenure, Dance
Kaleidoscope operated in the black. Still, that budget did not
provide for a salary attractive enough to lure a qualified artistic
director.</TE>
<TE>   Dance Kaleidoscope was founded in the late 1970s by Betty Empey,
formerly executive director of the now-defunct Los Angeles Ballet.
Empey, who also worked for virtually no salary, produced the series
annually at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood through the
Los Angeles Area Dance Alliance, a service organization for the dance
community. The idea was to give local dance companies of a wide range
of styles a chance to perform on a large stage under professional
concert conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The series lapsed in 1984 when Empey moved to the Bay Area. In
1987, Hewitt, a ballet-trained educator and former dancer, stepped
in, operating the festival independent of the dance alliance through
a new foundation. Hewitt kept some festival events at the Ford but
also expanded to other venues, including the Luckman Fine Arts
Complex at Cal State Los Angeles--where Hewitt taught dance and
presented other dance programs.</TE>
<TE>   In its heyday, Dance Kaleidoscope was the city's premier showcase
for local dance, presenting a multi-week festival of modern,
classical and world dance performances. In summer 2000, the event
included five performances of nearly 30 artists or groups in four
locations over three weekends. In February 2001, in the wake of
Hewitt's announcement that he would step down later that year, the
company's board said it planned to restructure and cut back still
further, presenting at most "a program or two" for summer 2001.</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, the only event Dance Kaleidoscope presented in
2001 was a July 21 tribute to Hewitt, with just a handful of
performances, at the Japan America Theatre, making the 2000 festival
the last Dance Kaleidoscope.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt said by phone from Portland that he chose to step down last
year partly because of the difficulty of producing the festival at
retirement age and partly because he began to be "worn out" by
negative press on the series in the last couple of years. "They
seemed to jump on anything we did. If we took a risk, we shouldn't
have taken a risk. That got somewhat discouraging," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we accomplished a great deal with a very moderate amount
of money," Hewitt added. "The thing about L.A. is, there is so much
richness to draw from--I became practically an addict of flamenco
dance, and East Indian dance by doing the festival. Dance K brought
one community to another community."</TE>
<TE>   Highways artistic director Danielle Brazell said the arts center
has no specific plans for the donated money but may use it for
capital improvements and that the gift may help leverage other funds.
"We are ecstatic," she said.</TE>

<HD>Henry Mancini Institute Puts Young Players in Spotlight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many of the young jazz-oriented players in attendance at this
summer's Henry Mancini Institute had an opportunity to display their
wares on Thursday night at UCLA's Schoenberg Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Performing in a variety of settings ranging from a piano trio to a
15-piece strings and percussion ensemble, they worked their way
through a mixed bag of original works by composers such as Billy
Childs, Bill Cunliffe and Dan Weinstein, as well as such well-known
jazz items as Charles Mingus' "Nostalgia in Times Square" and Herbie
Hancock's "Tell Me a Bedtime Story."</LD>
<LD>   Some of the players--especially the violinists and cellists--were
clearly in the early stages of exploring their improvisational
skills. Most deserve an "A" for their determined efforts. Others,
such as tenor saxophonist Jeff Ellwood and pianist Mahesh
Balasooriya, displayed inventive imaginations already functioning at
high professional levels. They're ready to dive into the demanding
musical currents of the contemporary jazz world.</LD>
<TE>   There were two particularly intriguing compositions on the bill.
Childs' "The Old Man Tells a Story" was an atmospheric study for
string quartet, woodwind quintet and rhythm section, overflowing with
the appealing melodies that Childs delivers with such seeming ease.
Cunliffe's "Reunion," for strings and percussion, attempted to blend
African rhythms with a lush sounding classical instrumentation.</TE>
<TE>   Other high points in the evening included a high-spirited romp
through Bix Beiderbecke's "Three Blind Mice," arranged by Ken Kugler
for brass quintet; a jazz trio rendering (featuring pianist
Balasooriya) of John Kibler's "Dimi's Song"; and a set of numbers by
a jazz sextet.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, the numbers that drew the greatest response from
the full-house audience were the Mingus work and "El Agua del
Clavelito" by Miguel Angel Pozo, arranged by violinist Lesa
Terry--undoubtedly because of the valiant improvisational efforts of
the string players and the sturdy support of a Latin percussion
section.</TE>
<TE>   Both performances, however, underscored the tendency at HMI to
skim the surface of musical styles rather than dig deeply into the
content. In the case of the Latin numbers, in particular, one
couldn't help but wonder why, despite her considerable talents, they
were directed by Terry. HMI takes place, after all, in a city
literally overflowing with genre-defining Latin musical artists, any
one of whom could have brought authenticity and insight to the
program.</TE>

<DH>Cathy Fink and Marcy Marxer, performing Sunday at Skirball
Center, find ways to entertain kids of all ages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're virtuoso multi-instrumentalists, tight harmony experts,
multiple Grammy Award nominees, independent record producers,
teachers of teachers and National Public Radio-featured artists. They
also yodel. And do rope tricks.</LD>
<LD>   Maryland-based, veteran folk singers and cowgirls at heart, Cathy
Fink and Marcy Marxer are making a rare Southland appearance. They're
doing two concerts at the Skirball Cultural Center's "Food Festival"
on Sunday, a daylong event exploring the international cuisine and
cultures of Los Angeles with tastings, demonstrations, music and arts
workshops.</LD>
<LD>   Marxer and Fink are part of an entertainment bill that also
includes members of Los Angeles Opera in a family musical based on
Tim Egan's book, "Friday Night at Hodges' Cafe," and the Susie Hansen
Band.</LD>
<TE>   Fink and Marxer, a folk-bluegrass team since 1983, will sing a few
new songs from the album they're working on, which "just so happens,"
said Fink, "to be about food and nutrition for children." They'll
include selections from their CD "All Wound Up," a 2002 Grammy
nominee for best musical children's album, and their most recent CD,
"Pocket Full of Stardust."</TE>
<TE>   "But we've got a pretty giant repertoire," Fink said.</TE>
<TE>   "We go from something that's emotional," Marxer said, "to
something that's crazy fun, to something topical, so kids and parents
have a lot to talk about when they go home. I love that."</TE>
<TE>   The pair's lively family concerts, a mix of folk, pop and old-time
jazz and swing rhythms, are highly participatory, with silly songs,
story songs, sing-alongs and hand-signing.</TE>
<TE>   Writing songs for children is "a wonderful, open-ended topic,"
Marxer said. She and Fink find inspiration in "listening to kids and
reflecting back something that's relevant to their lives," mixing
just-for-fun tunes with songs that use humor and reassurance to help
children cope with common concerns and fears.</TE>
<TE>   Performing for children is a skill that they began honing as
musician-teachers in schools and day-care centers in the 1970s; both
began instructing teachers in the use of music in the classroom
during the 1980s for the Virginia-based Wolf Trap Institute of Early
Learning Through the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Folk music, a children's music staple, is an especially resonant
way to deliver a message to young listeners, who don't care that it
isn't the usual Top 40 fare.</TE>
<TE>   "When people say oh, that's passe," Fink said, "I think what
they're thinking of is the folk music that became the pop music of
the '60s. But it is a living, growing thing."</TE>
<TE>   "It carries across hundreds of genres," Marxer said. "It's really
just music that speaks the mind of people. It can encompass African
music, European music, Cajun, bluegrass--all these kinds of music
have survived for a reason, and that reason is not mass marketing.
The reason is that folk music speaks to people on a gut level and a
heart level. It's music that's alive because people have kept it
alive."</TE>
<TE>   Their crowd-pleasing rope tricks and yodeling just sort of
happened. Marxer was introduced to roping at a convention of the Las
Vegas-based Wild West Arts Club a dozen years ago by "a bunch of old
guys talking about the last time they fell off Trigger for Roy Rogers
in the movies."</TE>
<TE>   The pair's yodeling expertise--they teach it around the
world--began early in their career when they performed with yodeling
cowgirl singer Patsy Montana, the first woman country music star to
sell a million records.</TE>
<TE>   "It works well with kids' shows," Marxer laughed. "It really grabs
the attention of the fifth-and sixth-grade boys. If you can win them
over early, you're doing great."</TE>
<TE>   Watching children and parents relate to each other during a
concert, however, may be their greatest satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, it's a discovery for both of them," Fink said. "We've
seen parents who didn't know that their kids had the coordination to
do one of our sign-language things, or they didn't know that their
kids had listened to the CD so much that they knew the words backward
and forward. Or we ask kids questions and the answers are a pleasant
surprise."</TE>
<TE>   And then there's what happens when they teach an audience to sing
one of their signature lullabies, "Give a Little Love Away."</TE>
<TE>   "We tell kids, this is not just a song for your parents to sing to
you," Fink said. "This is for you to sing to your parents too. And
this unbelievable thing happens. They're looking at each other and
they're smiling, and as they sing, they're saying something very
important to each other. If they can take that home with them, we've
done our job."</TE>

<HD>Dixie Chicks Return to Stage in Fine Fettle</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not unusual for enthusiastic fans to sing along, but it did
catch your ear Thursday at the Kodak Theatre when fans cheerfully
sang every word of the Dixie Chicks's 2000 hit "Goodbye Earl."</LD>
<LD>   Earl, you see, isn't going away in the conventional pop sense.
He's not leaving on a jet plane or leaving Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   The guy's an abusive husband who has pushed his wife, Wanda, too
far. When he ignores a court order to keep away and beats her so
severely that she requires intensive care, Wanda and her friend, Mary
Anne, serve Earl a plateful of black-eyed peas laced with poison.</LD>
<TE>   The key to the song, written by Dennis Linde (best known for Elvis
Presley's "Burning Love"), isn't that it is a stark, somber exercise.
It's an upbeat celebration, powered by guitars, banjos and fiddles.</TE>
<TE>   "Earl had to die!" screamed the Chicks' Natalie Maines, and the
fans screamed it back. The women in the audience, it might be noted,
did so with far more gusto.</TE>
<TE>   There are no figures on the song's effect on black-eyed pea sales,
but "Goodbye Earl" certainly made a lot of people, including country
radio programmers, nervous.</TE>
<TE>   But the tune underscored the Chicks' edgy independence, which has
created a bond with its audience during a period of disheartening
conservativeness in mainstream country music.</TE>
<TE>   Here, in fact, are three words to employ the next time some
country purist grumbles about how they just don't make stars the way
they used to: the Dixie Chicks.</TE>
<TE>   In their tours and first two albums, the Texas-based female
trio--which also features Martie Maguire on fiddle and backing vocals
and Emily Robison on banjo and backing vocals--reflected the
character-rich vocals and common folk sensibilities that have been at
the soulful center of country music since Hank Williams and Lefty
Frizzell. Their first two albums have sold more than 17 million
copies in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Because Nashville is counting on the first Chicks album in three
years to help add momentum to country music's rebounding commercial
fortunes, there were lots of eyes and ears directed on the Chicks'
concert Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In an acoustic performance taped for a December special on NBC,
the Chicks played all 12 songs from the new album--and the results
were encouraging indeed.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicks are returning to action after a high-profile contract
dispute with their label, Sony Music Entertainment. Their new album,
titled "Home" and due in stores Aug. 27, is filled with tunes that
reflect the complexities of relationships in ways that maintain
country's traditional roots while adding modern thematic
sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   It's a challenge playing so much new material, because fans are
often impatient for the familiar hits, but the response throughout
the hourlong sequence was strong.</TE>
<TE>   The tunes ranged from upbeat novelties, such as the
bluegrass-spiked "White Trash Wedding," or tender ones, including "I
Believe in Love." The latter, a poignant statement of social
optimism, was performed by the Chicks on the nationally televised
all-star telethon to raise money for victims of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But the song likely to attract the most attention is "Long Time
Gone," which the trio used to open Thursday's concert. The song may
ruffle a lot more feathers with radio programmers because it attacks
the generally soulless nature of country radio. A key line, saluting
country music great Johnny Cash, notes that Nashville today may have
"money, but they don't have Cash."</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the success of "O Brother, Where Art Thou?," country
programmers have said they are open to more traditional country music
offerings. With "Long Time Gone," the Chicks call their bluff.</TE>
<TE>   Because Robison is pregnant, the Chicks won't tour until the
spring. By then, their fans will be familiar enough with the music
from "Home" that they'll be singing along with "Long Time Gone" just
as resoundingly as they do now with "Goodbye Earl."</TE>

<HD>Frank or Just Plain Exploitative?</HD>

<LD>Can't we be spared the inevitable hype about another movie claiming
to deal with what's "real and truthful" in teenagers' lives ("The
Real Deal," by Patrick Goldstein, Aug. 13)? How many "real"
13-year-old girls do you know who are actively seducing their
24-year-old neighbors?</LD>
<LD>   I'll buy that teenage girls (and boys) are often lonely, alienated
and living in a culture with a lot of sexual hang-ups. However, I
also observe that "real" teenagers lead complex lives and
occasionally think about issues other than sex (funny how movies like
"Thirteen" seldom focus on those issues).</LD>
<LD>   The line between "truth-telling" and exploitation is often
difficult to draw; it would be wrong to expect that kind of insight
from 14-year-old girls. However, that's what the adults in their
lives are supposed to be doing.</LD>
<TE>   BONNIE SLOANE</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What will girls take from a film that makes a vivid show of
(rather than a discreet allusion to) their 14-year-old peers
lap-dancing a grown man?</TE>
<TE>   The director of "Thirteen" clearly means to be on the side of
girls pressured by a constant barrage of "messages we send them
[about] body consciousness." She may mean to be making a cautionary
tale, but I suspect that such imagery will simply become part of the
same media barrage of images of glamorous, "willowy" teens being
daring and adult.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly, though, it will just up the ante for Hollywood's portrayal
of teen sex, encouraging ever more "frank" (i.e., titillating,
gratuitous) imagery for the sake of ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever Hollywood says it will present a story that is "frank"
and "challenging," it ends up just raising the bar of exploitation.</TE>

<TE>   Viva the double standard. On Sunday, plus-size director Neil
LaBute was described in The Times as "burly" ("A Repertory Company of
One," by Hugh Hart, Aug. 11).</TE>
<TE>   Just one day later, Anna Nicole Smith was slammed with this
sentence: "Seemingly at peace with the tonnage she added since her
cover-girl glory, our heroine carried herself like Moby-Dick in drag
... " ("The Buffoon Hunter," by Howard Rosenberg, Aug. 13).</TE>
<TE>   The message is clear: Large-size man OK, large-size woman
shameful.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder so many women starve themselves.</TE>
<TE>   SUEBOB DAVIS</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect to Howard Rosenberg, his appraisal of the new
Anna Nicole Smith series is almost shockingly off-base. While I and
my friends saw a deeply depressed and clearly drug-addled woman
acting out a pattern of self-destruction, Rosenberg sees a buffoon.</TE>
<TE>   His ridicule of Anna Nicole seems misplaced, given her state of
physical and emotional ill health. He would do better to aim his
attack at the people responsible for this sad and exploitative
spectacle. At least they presumably have the clarity to make
responsible choices, and they have chosen to make a laughingstock of
a woman whose misery is hard to watch, though just as with a train
wreck, it's hard to look away.</TE>

<LD>It's one thing to think Steve Irwin a buffoon; after all, Howard
Rosenberg is entitled to his opinion ("The Buffoon Hunter," Aug. 12).
But when he says Irwin "earns fancy money using animals as props
under the pretense of helping them," Rosenberg shows he lacks
knowledge of the people he writes about.</LD>
<LD>   The Irwins not only own and run the Australia Zoo but also several
additional animal conservancies across Australia. Most of the money
they earn from the TV shows, merchandise and movies goes back into
supporting their work.</LD>
<LD>   Now does that sound like someone who is a "faux champion of
animals"?</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the new Dixie Chicks album hits the sales chart Sept. 4, nobody
in Nashville will be surprised if it enters at No. 1, not only in
country but on the pop chart as well.</LD>
<LD>   If so, the Chicks will be the fourth country music act this year
to score the bestselling album in the nation, following Alan Jackson,
Kenny Chesney and Toby Keith.</LD>
<LD>   "When you look at what's still coming, with new albums from Shania
Twain, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill by the end of the year, country
music will have a larger percentage of the marketplace this year than
it's had in a number of prior years," says RCA Label Group chairman
Joe Galante. "Does that mean everything's coming up roses? No. We
still have to take it one step at a time. But it certainly feels
good."</LD>
<TE>   "Good" isn't something Nashville has felt much since the country
music boom of the early '90s went bust a few years later.</TE>
<TE>   But 2002 is shaping up as the year the pendulum started swinging
back. Just how far that swing will reach, or how long it will last,
nobody knows. But "cautious optimism" is the new mantra on Music Row.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that if we could figure out how to keep people from
stealing music on the Internet, Nashville will be on its way back to
having another big boom," says Tony Brown, senior partner in the new
Universal South label and former president of MCA Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   The quick explanations for the turnaround are Sept. 11 and the
surprise success of the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack. The
attacks last year put people in a mood to focus on fundamentals, the
thinking goes, a shift that was already reflected musically in the
commercial breakthrough for rootsy mountain music courtesy of "O
Brother."</TE>
<TE>   "Toby and Alan's records benefited from songs with a patriotic
bent," says Michael McCall, senior editor for Nashville-based Country
Music magazine, referring to Jackson's song "Where Were You (When the
World Stopped Turning)" and Keith's current hit "Courtesy of the Red,
White and Blue (The Angry American)."</TE>
<TE>   "Other genres aren't dealing with it as directly," McCall says of
Sept. 11 and its aftermath. "So some part of country music is
fulfilling a need among listeners right now."</TE>
<TE>   The appeal of "O Brother" is seen in some quarters as a rebuke to
the polished, pop-sounding product that's come out of Nashville in
recent years, as well as to the prefab pop of such acts as 'N Sync
and the Backstreet Boys.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody's predicting that country's popularity will return to the
heights it hit in the early '90s, when Garth Brooks topped an influx
of new superstars whose multimillion-selling albums helped the genre
rack up nearly 19% of all music sales in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the musical gold rush, record companies expanded
their Nashville operations dramatically, flooding record bins
nationwide with country music, much of it mediocre.</TE>
<TE>   That market share dipped to a recent low of 10.7% in 2001.
According to Nielsen SoundScan figures, country music sales are up
slightly (less than 1%) over the same period in 2001, but that
happened while overall record sales have dropped nearly 10% from this
time last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the situation now is a lot like the stock market,"
says Lon Helton, country music editor for the trade publication Radio
&amp; Records. "Is this a real rally, is it a bear market rally, is it
just a blip or what?</TE>
<TE>   "But to carry on the analogy, when you do have a real sea change
in the stock market, it's because there are a lot of things happening
in a row that give you a lot of momentum," Helton says. "And in
country today, we're in a territory right now not unlike what was
happening in 1987-88."</TE>
<TE>   Helton cites Top 40 radio's increasing play of rhythmic and
hip-hop records, which makes country radio more appealing to the
segment of the audience that enjoys the boy bands and young female
singers.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the issue of introducing new artists. Statistics
compiled by Radio &amp; Records indicate a correlation between country's
general popularity and the first successes of new acts.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine found that in country's most prosperous years, more
acts placed their first single in the Top 15 than in succeeding years
when country's popularity ebbed.</TE>
<TE>   "So it's not just the strength of a Toby Keith, Alan Jackson or
Kenny Chesney," Helton says. "When you see Darryl Worley sell 42,000
copies of his new album in the first week, or Kellie Coffey at
150,000 sales with just one single, you do get the sense that maybe
there is something bubbling under."</TE>
<TE>   The statistic that doesn't benefit the new-boom theory is one
showing that people are spending less time listening to the radio: In
1994, listeners averaged 11 1/2 hours a week tuned in, compared to 6
1/2 hours last year.</TE>
<TE>   That, Helton says, translates into more restricted playlists,
which is particularly sobering in country music, where another survey
showed that 86% of listeners learn about new music from radio,
compared to an average of 77% in other genres.</TE>
<TE>   Other nonmusical issues come into play, most significantly the
corporate mergers that resulted in a drastic reshuffling of labels,
musicians and executives in recent years, and the media buying frenzy
that put more radio stations into fewer and fewer hands.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the changes contributed to conservatism both at labels
and in radio. Radio programmers and record companies tried to stick
with the known rather than risk losing jobs on artists or songs that
might fail.</TE>
<TE>   Several years into the brave new world, those corporations are
again consolidating operations, and some executives say they see a
new willingness in radio to give newcomers a shot, though their
generosity is expected to diminish as the various big-gun albums show
up over the next several weeks. Hill's album is due in mid-October,
her husband McGraw's on Nov. 26, and Twain's at a date in the fall to
be announced.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all had to shrink," says Paul Worley, barely a month into
his job as chief creative officer for Warner Bros. Nashville. "There
are natural things that happen that make everybody's sensibilities
sharper. Ultimately, the music is better when these things happen and
there's not quite as large a machine stamping out product."</TE>
<TE>   So what are the odds that the upswing will continue beyond the
superstar albums that are expected to close out 2002 with a bang?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm betting heavily that it will," Worley says, echoing
sentiments expressed by other top label executives. "Will it be
anything like it was 10, 12 years ago? I doubt it. That was really
phenomenal.... But I think country's in the position to be really
strong and popular and have another really good run, certainly for
the next five or six years."</TE>

<LD>   'Hairspray' Takes Hold in Broadway Debut</LD>
<LD>   So, after all the buzz, is "Hairspray," the musical based on John
Waters' 1988 cult film, going to be the next "Producers"? With a
$5-million advance and raves during its Seattle run, hopes are riding
high for the production, which opened Thursday night at the Neil
Simon Theatre.</LD>
<TE>   The show drew upbeat reviews, if not the raves accorded the Mel
Brooks comedy. But critics--praising Harvey Fierstein's star turn as
a frumpy hausfrau and Marc Shaiman's score--almost uniformly
predicted that "Hairspray" had the makings of a hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Staged with an energy and zest that doesn't let down," Associated
Press drama critic Michael Kuchwara said of the piece, a story of a
pleasingly plump, dance-obsessed teen in 1960s Baltimore. USA Today's
Elysa Gardner advised those with no tolerance for racial humor, fat
jokes or sexual innuendo to head elsewhere. But she called it "kitsch
at its purest and least apologetic" and gave it 3 1/2 stars out of a
possible four.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times' Ben Brantley wasn't alone in calling the show
a bit preachy. But it "succeeds in re-creating the pleasures of the
old-fashioned musical comedy without seeming old-fashioned," he
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   One holdout was the Boston Globe's Ed Siegel: " 'Hairspray,' for
all its cleverness, can be as annoying as it is entertaining," he
observed. Still, he conceded, that shouldn't prevent it from becoming
"a huge success."</TE>

<TE>   Book Tracks Women's Progress in Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   Three women now run Hollywood studios--a pipe dream to those who
entered the business when Hollywood was exclusively a men's club.</TE>
<TE>   The strides made in the last three decades are the focus of "Women
Who Run the Show: How a Brilliant and Creative New Generation of
Women Stormed Hollywood," due out from St. Martin's Press on Sept. 6.
Written by former documentarian Mollie Gregory, it presents
first-person accounts from 125 women, including two of the studio
chiefs (Paramount's Sherry Lansing, Columbia's Amy Pascal), former
National Endowment for the Arts Chairman Jane Alexander, producer
Marcia Nasatir and stars, such as Liv Ullmann and Barbra Streisand,
who've doubled in back of the camera.</TE>
<TE>   The turning point? The 1970s, when the women's movement coincided
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Act, Gregory maintains.</TE>
<TE>   "Though most men in the industry had never worked with women
except for secretaries and publicists, some of them were terrific,"
she said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Steven Bochco gave Randa Haines ["Children of a Lesser God"] a
chance to direct 'Hill Street Blues'--though she'd only done a couple
of PBS pieces. Norman Lear asked Joan Darling to direct 'Mary
Hartman, Mary Hartman' when she'd only tackled plays.</TE>
<TE>   "The celluloid ceiling is still there, of course--but not to the
degree it was. Women aren't running everything, but at least we are
contenders."</TE>

<TE>   La Jolla Playhouse to Get Third Stage</TE>
<TE>   La Jolla Playhouse on Friday unveiled the design for an
$11.5-million expansion that will provide the nonprofit regional
theater company with its third stage--a black box that can seat up to
450 playgoers and be reconfigured for each production.</TE>
<TE>   The 45,000-square-foot addition will be called the Joan and Irwin
Jacobs Center for La Jolla Playhouse, in honor of the Qualcomm
founder and his wife, who donated $5 million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Complementing the existing Mandell Weiss Theatre and the Mandell
Weiss Forum, it will also contain rehearsal and educational spaces,
administrative offices and a new restaurant-cabaret. Construction is
scheduled to begin this winter, with a projected opening in spring
2004.</TE>
<TE>   The Playhouse has raised $32 million of its $36-million goal for a
five-year campaign kicked off in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Because of a scheduling conflict, former Beatle Paul McCartney has
postponed receiving his Kennedy Center Honor from this year to 2003.
Another honoree for 2002 will be selected.... Despite allegations
that the domestic diva engaged in insider trading on Wall Street,
King World Productions has renewed "Martha Stewart Living" for a 10th
season.... Jason Priestley continues to make progress after surgery
this week on his back and feet following a racing accident Sunday.
"He has mobility and feeling now in all of his extremities," said a
spokesman for Indianapolis' Methodist Hospital.... People magazine
reports that Jaclyn Smith ("Charlie's Angels") is getting radiation
treatment for a small malignant growth discovered a few weeks ago.</TE>

<HD>Touching Bass</HD>
<DH>As Charlie Haden turns 65, the jazzman looks back on--and
ahead to--a life of improvisation</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD REICH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>On a typical night, the crowd never really pipes down at the Blue
Note, where tourists from around the world converge six nights a week
to see the biggest names in jazz.</LD>
<LD>   But on this evening, the audience is practically holding its
breath, the waitresses have stopped serving drinks, and the blenders
have fallen silent, along with the cash register, the phones and
anything else that might shatter the mood.</LD>
<LD>   A hush has fallen over the room, perhaps the ultimate compliment
to a musician whose art is as soft-spoken and spiritual as any in
jazz.</LD>
<TE>   But is this any way to celebrate a birthday?</TE>
<TE>   To veteran Los Angeles bassist-bandleader Charlie Haden, who's
marking his 65th birthday with two weeks of performances at the
Greenwich Village landmark, it's the greatest gift he could imagine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very rare to be in a jazz club and have people listen,"
Haden tells the crowd after a sublimely understated duo set Wednesday
night with Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba. "It means that we are
thankful that people like you are in the world, because if there were
more like you, there would be much more beauty in this world."</TE>
<TE>   In truth, however, the capacity crowd simply has responded in kind
to the music that Haden is playing, an introspective form of jazz
improvisation that emphasizes exquisitely singing lines over mere
virtuosity, warmly radiant timbres over sturm und drang.</TE>
<TE>   What the audience doesn't realize is that playing the bass has
become a physically painful experience for Haden, who early in 2001
was attacked by a Rottweiler in his Los Angeles neighborhood and
sustained nerve damage to his left hand. A year and a half of
physical therapy has helped restore Haden's technique, and doctors
say that Haden eventually will have a full recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "But it still hurts like crazy," says Haden between sets at the
Blue Note, where he's in residence through Sunday, playing a series
of duet dates with Rubalcaba, Paul Bley, Brad Mehldau and other
kindred spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Haden plays through the pain, producing precisely the
humanistic brand of music-making that has been his hallmark for more
than four decades, even as he has stayed at the forefront of
oft-controversial developments in jazz. Whether forging a new
approach to jazz improvisation with Ornette Coleman in the late 1950s
or exploring world music influences on his "Folk Songs" album in the
'70s or reveling in Hollywood film noir on "Haunted Heart" in the
'90s, his deeply burnished tone and soaring lyricism have been
unmistakable.</TE>
<TE>   "As I look back on my career, I can't say that I had any great
plan, except to make melody," says Haden. "But I also had to make new
music, no matter what the cost. And believe me, there have been
costs, there have been sacrifices."</TE>
<TE>   And there has been resistance, right from the start, when Haden
arrived in L.A. from his family's home in the rural Midwest in the
mid-1950s. Having encountered Coleman playing his white plastic alto
saxophone in an L.A. club, Haden sought him out and quickly was
rehearsing with the jazz visionary in Coleman's "one-room shack of an
apartment," recalls the bassist.</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard anything so brilliant in my life as I did that
first time I heard Ornette," says Haden. "He played like some
revolutionary angel. Soon we were rehearsing in his place, music
scattered everywhere, and he was telling me to play 'outside the
chord changes,' which was exactly what I had been wanting to do. Now
I had permission."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Haden was uniquely equipped to grasp Coleman's radical
new theory of improvising on the contours of a melody rather than on
the preordained chord changes that drove music from the bebop era and
before. Haden, after all, had grown up singing and playing country
music on the radio with his family, their repertoire featuring
down-home sounds of the kind recently popularized by the film "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?" It was through these daily sessions that
Haden first learned to craft melodic lines in creative ways, on the
spot.</TE>
<TE>   Though Coleman's revolutionary late '50s quartet--with Haden,
drummer Billy Higgins and trumpeter Don Cherry--was verbally and even
physically assaulted by naysayers, in retrospect it's inarguable that
this ensemble helped usher in a new era of "free jazz."</TE>
<TE>   Those early days briefly came alive again at the Blue Note on
Tuesday night, when Haden played duets with pianist Bley, who in the
late 1950s famously recorded at L.A.'s Hillcrest Club with the
Coleman quartet.</TE>
<TE>   The splashes of dissonance and free-ranging musical dialogue
between Bley and Haden this time around seemed almost nostalgic, the
music that once launched fistfights having been incorporated into the
lexicon of modern jazz long ago. Nevertheless, the easy give-and-take
between Bley and Haden proved difficult to resist.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I play with Charlie, it feels like family, and maybe
that comes across in the music," Bley says after the show. "Even back
when I first met him, in the '50s, he was an amazing player, because
he already had perfect time."</TE>
<TE>   The range of artists whose music Haden has ennobled is remarkably
wide, from the radical late-period recordings of John Coltrane to the
extended keyboard ruminations of Keith Jarrett, from the
genre-defying saxophone solos of Archie Shepp to the emotionally
charged South American music of reedist Gato Barbieri.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Haden has explored antiwar political commentary
through his Liberation Music Orchestra of the 1970s as well as the
moody ambience of vintage Hollywood movies and Raymond Chandler
novels with his Quartet West of the '80s and '90s. Haden also founded
the jazz studies program at California Institute of the Arts in
Valencia, where he still teaches.</TE>
<TE>   It would take a month or more to survey all the avenues that Haden
has traveled, but he touched on one of the most recent by partnering
with pianist Rubalcaba, whose work was transformed by their
collaboration on Haden's "Nocturne." The album won a Grammy this year
in the Latin jazz category and is nominated in the same category in
the upcoming Latin Grammys. Though listeners typically think of
Rubalcaba as a super-virtuoso armed with a titanic technique, his
duets with Haden sounded practically transparent, the pianist playing
long, silken lines and utterly spare textures.</TE>
<TE>   "When I am playing with Charlie, I come to a place that I can get
to only with him," Rubalcaba says between sets. "Something happens
between us, something spontaneous that I don't find with anyone else.
But I guess maybe everybody who plays with Charlie thinks the same
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Haden apparently holds Rubalcaba in comparably high regard, which
is why, at set's end, he invites the pianist to play a solo.</TE>
<TE>   So Rubalcaba sits down at the keyboard and begins an unusually
lush and mysterious version of "Happy, Birthday," with some members
of the audience quietly singing along.</TE>
<TE>   Once the last chord is played, Haden and Rubalcaba embrace on
stage, summing up the kind of affection and admiration that fills the
room.</TE>
<TE>   "So I'm 65," Haden says after the show in his dressing room, as
friends crowd inside to congratulate him on the milestone, which
occurred on Aug. 6. "I feel like I'm very young," he adds and,
indeed, looks as if he's pushing 50, at most.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy, I'm healthy, I'm making music with my friends, I'm
finding new sounds. Actually, I feel like I'm just beginning."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>These days the penis can't get no respect. Health professionals label
it toxic if not downright lethal. Prosecutors denounce it as a blunt
offensive weapon. And those endless e-mail spam offers to enlarge it
cast suspicion on even the most innocent exhibitionists.</LD>
<LD>   Who can point with pride to manhood in such shriveling times?
David Friend and Simon Morley, that's who. In a shamelessly
celebratory locker-room charade titled "Puppetry of the Penis," these
enterprising Aussies manage to make the penis user-friendly again
through the power of laughter.</LD>
<LD>   At the Coronet Theatre on Thursday, the start of an indefinite
run, Friend and Morley stretched, twisted, bent and mashed what used
to be their private parts into the delirious public "installations"
(their word) previously on view in Melbourne, Edinburgh, London,
Montreal, Toronto and New York.</LD>
<TE>   A winking eye, the Eiffel Tower, a hamburger, the Loch Ness
Monster, a turtle coming out of its shell: Enlarged by simultaneous
video projection, Friend and Morley's dexterity in what they call
"genital origami" achieved a lunatic virtuosity through their
hourlong set.</TE>
<TE>   They did miss a few obvious tricks. Friend, for instance,
inadvertently did a pretty good Capitol Records Tower (without the
spire) just warming up. And you can blame their parents for the early
surgery that prevented more voluminous effects. Size may not matter
in this line of work, but yardage does.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Morley adopted the air of a jaded tour guide while
Friend excelled at parodies of slick sportscasters who describe
athletic feats in hushed tones. And he grew positively glorious when
approximating that inimitably Aussie state of blissed-out,
beer-soaked pub dementia.</TE>
<TE>   Stand-up comedian Alexandra McHale opened the evening with a very
funny and raunchy half-hour catalog of contemporary obsessions.
And--who knows?--maybe the liberated willy is about to join the list.</TE>
<TE>   If so, Friend and Morley deserve a lot of the credit--or the
blame. Laughing off all the taboos that keep a good man down,
"Puppetry of the Penis" is a show for every male who ever played with
it (and, guys, we know who you are) and every female who ever wished
it were more, well, decorative (fess up, ladies). It will also
inspire creative souls of any gender who have longed to find more
uses for it than its highly limited normal functions (name more than
three).</TE>
<TE>   Obviously societal standards of good taste need to be, um,
suspended for the event, and some conservative souls who didn't
cancel their subscriptions after Paragraph 2 of this review may wish
that the ground would open at any moment and destroy all
participants, ticket-holders and critics.</TE>
<TE>   Wish away, but don't hold your breath. If there's one thing that
Friend and Morley have proved in their four years of international
show-biz success, it's that a performing penis incontestably has
legs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Fred Thompson Reportedly May Join 'Law &amp; Order' Cast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), who is not seeking reelection in
November, is reportedly in negotiations to join the cast of NBC's
long-running legal series "Law &amp; Order" this fall.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson, who would be the first sitting senator to play a leading
role in a TV series, would replace Dianne Wiest as the New York City
district attorney and boss of executive assistant D.A. Jack McCoy
(Sam Waterston) and assistant D.A. Serena Southerlyn (Elisabeth
Rohm), according to reports.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson, who turns 60 on Monday, worked as a shoe salesman, truck
driver and a factory worker before becoming an attorney. He gained
national prominence as minority counsel of the Senate Watergate
Committee when he was 30.</LD>
<TE>   In 1977, as assistant U.S. attorney for Tennessee, he successfully
represented Marie Ragghianti, the former chairwoman of the state's
parole board, who had sued the state over her dismissal. Ragghianti
had charged that Gov. Ray Blanton was involved in a cash-for-clemency
scheme. Eight years later, Hollywood transformed the Ragghianti case
into the Sissy Spacek feature, "Marie: A True Story," and Thompson
was cast as himself.</TE>
<TE>   Though the film bombed at the box office, Hollywood took notice of
Thompson's natural screen presence and he appeared in strong
supporting roles in such films as "No Way Out," "The Hunt for Red
October," "Die Hard 2," "Cape Fear," "Born Yesterday" and "In the
Line of Fire." Thompson also appeared in three episodes of "Wiseguy"
in 1987 and was a guest star on "China Beach," "Roseanne" and
"Matlock."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson was elected to the Senate in 1994. He announced in March
that he would not be seeking reelection in November. Produced by Dick
Wolf, "Law &amp; Order" is set to begin its 13th season on the peacock
network on Oct. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf Films, NBC and Thompson's office in Washington declined
comment on Friday.</TE>

<HD>Tour Fare Is Caviar at Bowl</HD>
<DH>L.A. Philharmonic, tuning up at Hollywood Bowl for its
European jaunt, offers programs and playing that matter. More,
please.</DH>

<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Esa-Pekka Salonen told the crowd at the Hollywood Bowl on Thursday
night that the Los Angeles Philharmonic would not be around for a
while. It embarks next week on a two-week, five-stop European tour,
and its music director assured the audience that he and the orchestra
would do its utmost to make Los Angeles proud.</LD>
<LD>   There is little to worry about, given the splendid performances
not only Thursday night but also those heard Tuesday and in the two
programs last week. Everything has been chosen to make an impact, to
play to Salonen's and the orchestra's strengths. The music comes from
the 20th century, or at least plays off music that does.</LD>
<LD>   One program, heard at the Bowl last week and scheduled for the
Lucerne Festival and at the Proms concerts in London's Albert Hall,
is sure to raise eyebrows and maybe some political consciousness. One
looks forward to the comment it will engender. It contrasts
Shostakovich's rarely heard Second Symphony, an ode to Lenin and the
brotherhood of the workers' struggle, with the all-embracing ode to
brotherhood that is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Both were written in
moments of desperate optimism; we listen, however, with ears
conditioned by history.</LD>
<TE>   It is a happy arrangement that Philharmonic tours also serve
Bowlgoers, providing a level of performance considerably higher and
program making considerably more interesting than usual. There are
compromises in playing outdoors, of course. The Shostakovich didn't
take sonically or spiritually in a setting of picnic plenty, and the
Beethoven Ninth seemed not quite as inspired as it has been in the
past under Salonen.</TE>
<TE>   But it was positively inspiring to witness the incomparable hush
of thousands held spellbound Tuesday by Mahler's "Des Knaben
Wunderhorn," with profoundly communicative Thomas Quasthoff and
deeply moving Lilli Paasikivi as soloists. (Matthias Goerne will sing
all the "Wunderhorn" songs at the Lucerne Festival with the
orchestra, while Quasthoff will be joined by alto Anna Larson at the
Edinburgh Festival.)</TE>
<TE>   Just how much these programs represent Los Angeles, however, might
be questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the tour nor the Bowl programs have included Salonen's own
music, and that is a glaring omission, and all the more so given that
Yefim Bronfman is the soloist in Bartok's First Piano Concerto in all
tour venues. Bronfman has lately been playing Salonen's solo work
"Dichotomie," which could make a fine pre-concert presentation.</TE>
<TE>   But at least there is Stravinsky's "Agon." In introducing the
12-tone 1957 ballet score after intermission on Thursday night,
Salonen mentioned that it was the only tour piece written in Los
Angeles, written in fact at Stravinsky's West Hollywood home, and the
crowd roared its approval.</TE>
<TE>   "Agon" was part of a program of brilliant works that included a
gripping performance of Sibelius' Seventh Symphony, a luminous
reading of Ravel's "Mother Goose" Suite and a rollicking run-through
of his "La Valse." None of this is news to regular symphony-goers,
because all of the tour repertory (with the exception of the
"Wunderhorn" songs) are works gleaned from the past two winter
seasons at the Music Center.</TE>
<TE>   But the Los Angelesness of "Agon" made it special Thursday, as it
will, I predict, in Europe. This may be the most modern-sounding
music audiences will hear at the Bowl all summer, but it was
grippingly played by an orchestra that has the style in its blood.</TE>
<TE>   It is also music that highlights soloists and breaks the orchestra
into small ensembles, which makes it much more amenable to
amplification than the Romantic period music that dominates most of
the summer here.</TE>
<TE>   Most important of all, it piqued the audience's interest. As I
walked out at the concert's end, nearly every conversation I
overheard was about "Agon." Some didn't like it, but at least they
were talking about it--and not real estate!</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing particularly novel about orchestras doing their
cities proud on tour; they always take along their well-prepared best
with exactly that intention in mind.</TE>
<TE>   But wouldn't it be something if the Los Angeles Philharmonic could
do its city proud at home all summer long as it has these past two
weeks?</TE>

<HD>'Oblivious' Host Makes His Mark</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't be surprised if sometime, somewhere, someplace when you least
expect it, someone steps up to you and asks: "Hey, who hosted 'Candid
Camera,' Allen Funt or Alfred Lunt?"</LD>
<LD>   Yes, from that Frankenstein lab where new TV shows are cobbled
together from programs of the past comes "Oblivious," a guilty
pleasure that's part quiz show and part hidden-camera tomfoolery.</LD>
<LD>   Hosted with an addled affability by Regan Burns, the show kicks
off a week of programs Sunday at 9 p.m. on TNN.</LD>
<TE>   The premise is simple: Burns, disguised as a waiter, bartender or
the like, engages an oblivious customer or two in conversation while
slyly popping in five pop-culture questions. After revealing his
identity, Burns peels off a $20 bill for each correct question.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in the usual studio-based game show, a $100 top prize would
leave both contestants and viewers more than a little underwhelmed.</TE>
<TE>   But out in the real world, this kind of unexpected windfall,
however modest, packs the same simple, out-of-the-blue pleasure punch
as finding cash in the pocket of an old jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Once per episode, Burns ups the ante by letting the "mark" assume
his role, donning an earpiece so Burns can direct the action from
back in the production truck.</TE>
<TE>   It's a bit borrowed from David Letterman, but it works beautifully
all the same, with the original "mark" earning $100 for each question
the new target answers correctly.</TE>
<TE>   The question-answer stuff is fun, but watching Burns blunder his
way through the list of questions before his customers call for the
manager is even better.</TE>
<TE>   His quick-hit questions leading into commercial breaks are a
particular delight.</TE>
<TE>   And the startled reaction after Burns creeps behind a diner in a
sidewalk cafe is one that would make Allen Funt (or is it Alfred
Lunt?) proud.</TE>

<HD>Probe of Analysts May Face Hurdles</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Regulators scrutinize boosterism of tottering
stocks, but the challenge in prosecuting would be showing an intent
to deceive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The resignation of a prominent stock analyst this week shows how
deeply the furor over analysts' credibility has shaken Wall Street,
and signals that the controversy may grow in coming months as
regulators press on with a series of investigations.</LD>
<LD>   With his departure from Salomon Smith Barney late Thursday, Jack
Grubman became the highest-profile casualty in the 15-month-long
scrutiny of stock analysts. Grubman left the firm in what Salomon
called a "mutual agreement."</LD>
<LD>   Several regulatory agencies are studying Grubman's relentlessly
bullish stance on telecommunications stocks since 2000, even as many
of the companies collapsed, costing investors billions of dollars in
lost market value.</LD>
<TE>   The attention to Grubman is part of a broader inquiry by
regulators into whether many analysts' boosterism for certain stocks
was driven by undisclosed financial conflicts--specifically, the
desire to lure investment banking business from the subject firms.</TE>
<TE>   In a related probe, investigators are focusing on how brokerages
granted shares in hot new stock offerings to favored clients during
the tech-stock boom. Such grants may have violated securities laws if
there was understood to be a direct link to future banking business.</TE>
<TE>   As for the role brokerage analysts played in Wall Street's alleged
abuses of the late 1990s, experts say it may be tough for authorities
to prove serious wrongdoing by those individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen months after the first congressional hearings on the
credibility of brokerage stock touts, authorities have yet to charge
any analysts with civil or criminal wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   In the most celebrated case so far, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in June
agreed to pay a $100-million penalty and to change its analyst
practices, as part of a settlement with New York State Atty. Gen.
Eliot Spitzer to avoid a full-scale legal assault.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's case against Merrill was boosted by his discovery of
dozens of incriminating e-mail messages in which the brokerage's
Internet industry analysts privately derided the stocks they were
pitching to investors.</TE>
<TE>   But none of Merrill's analysts faced charges individually in the
case. And suits filed by private plaintiffs' attorneys alleging that
Merrill analysts misled investors primarily are seeking damages from
the firm rather than from the analysts.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal regulators have been hunting for other "smoking
gun" evidence in their probes of brokerages' research operations. But
their investigations have been hampered because some Wall Street
firms appear to have destroyed internal e-mails that they are
required to hand over in such probes, according to published reports.</TE>
<TE>   Without such concrete evidence to verify wrongdoing, regulators
must build cases by less direct methods, such as by studying
analysts' compensation contracts for indications that pay was based
on investment banking leads, said Nina McKenna, a former enforcement
attorney at the National Assn. of Securities Dealers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very challenging because you don't have a
smoking gun like the e-mails," said McKenna, who now is a brokerage
industry attorney at Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal in Kansas City.
"You're stuck with evidence that is a lot more amorphous."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a number of high-profile probes of analysts are continuing.
Spitzer and the NASD are investigating Grubman and Salomon. The
Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. attorney in Manhattan
are conducting their own industry-wide analyst probes.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD may be close to bringing action against Grubman. It has
notified him that it may charge him with violating securities rules
for his bullish recommendations of Winstar Communications Inc. even
as the company crumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman has denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the challenge in prosecuting analysts is in showing
that they had an intent to deceive, and that stock touts that went
awry simply weren't cases of bad judgment. Grubman, for example, said
he "always wrote what he believed."</TE>
<TE>   But brokerage reports must be based on reasonable assumptions of
companies' prospects, said James Cox, securities law professor at
Duke University. If a report can be shown to be lacking in that
regard, then the case against the analyst may be strong, he said.</TE>

<HD>AOL Probes May Focus on Deals by Ex-Official</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Prosecutors and SEC reportedly are reviewing
transactions David Colburn oversaw.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES ROWLEY and ANNA MARIE STOLLEY</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. prosecutors and securities regulators are investigating
advertising transactions that former AOL Time Warner Inc. executive
David Colburn oversaw when he headed America Online Inc.'s business
affairs unit, people familiar with the inquiry said.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department began its investigation before Colburn left
the company last week, the people said. On Wednesday, AOL Time Warner
disclosed it was reviewing whether its America Online unit, the
world's largest Internet service, had "inappropriately" booked
revenue totaling $49 million from three transactions over six
quarters.</LD>
<LD>   Colburn oversaw or was directly involved in some of the
transactions being examined by prosecutors and by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the people said.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC expanded an investigation after the Washington Post
reported July 18 that AOL Time Warner boosted revenue by $270 million
with "unconventional" transactions. These included booking as revenue
advertisements America Online sold on behalf of EBay Inc. and ads it
provided for Sun Microsystems Inc. in return for computer equipment,
the newspaper reported.</TE>
<TE>   Colburn's Washington lawyer, Roger Spaeder, declined to comment.
Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra also refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner notified the SEC and federal prosecutors earlier
this month of concerns about whether America Online had properly
booked the $49 million as revenue after an employee raised questions
about one of the three transactions, a person said. AOL Time Warner
discovered the two other transactions in the course of reviewing the
employee's complaint, people said.</TE>
<TE>   The company disclosed July 31 that the Justice Department and the
SEC were investigating accounting of some, unspecified, advertising
transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria, Va., are
conducting the criminal investigation, people said.</TE>
<TE>   Colburn headed America Online's business affairs unit in Dulles,
Va., before the company acquired Time Warner Inc. to form AOL Time
Warner Inc. He became president of business development for the
combined company's subscription services and advertising-and-commerce
units.</TE>
<TE>   After Colburn's departure last week, company officials changed the
locks on his office to secure the files about the transactions being
reviewed, a person said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based AOL Time Warner rose 70 cents to $12.56
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>SEC Says 11 Firms Failed to Certify</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Gemstar and Alaska Air are among the companies
listed as not complying with the order to swear by financial results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Top officers of 11 U.S. companies have failed to meet a government
demand to affirm their past financial results, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC reported on its Web site that 11 companies' executives
sent in filings that didn't match the prescribed language to vouch
for the accuracy of recent financial statements, including Gemstar-TV
Guide International Inc., Alaska Air Group Inc., telephone firm
McLeodUSA Inc., Adams Resources &amp; Energy Inc. and hardware wholesaler
TruServ Corp., which is a cooperative.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the companies listed as not complying had announced
earlier that they wouldn't vouch for the accuracy of their financial
statements. They included the high-profile names from America's
season of corporate scandals: Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc., Dynegy Inc.
and Adelphia Communications Corp. All are under investigation by the
SEC for accounting irregularities.</LD>
<TE>   The accounting scandals prompted the unprecedented SEC order that
the chief executives and chief financial officers of about 950 large
companies certify their latest financial statements or explain why
they couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of companies facing a Wednesday deadline to
certify met the deadline with the prescribed statements, the SEC's
Web site shows.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska Air, which was listed as not complying, said its filing
explained that it expects to change certain accounting policies,
resulting in a restatement of previous financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   Adams Resources &amp; Energy, whose CEO, K.S. "Bud" Adams Jr., owns
the National Football League's Tennessee Titans, also was singled out
by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it received an SEC inquiry on its 2001 annual and
2002 first-quarter reports days before its Wednesday deadline to
certify. The firm said it decided not to fully certify past
statements until it had resolved the SEC inquiry.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Probing Charter's Accounting</HD>
<DH>Cable: A grand jury subpoenas files on costs and
subscribers. The inquiry focuses on issues similar to those raised in
shareholder suits, the company says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debt-laden cable giant Charter Communications Inc. said it has
received a federal grand jury subpoena demanding information on the
company's accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis-based Charter, controlled by billionaire Paul Allen,
said the subpoena seeks documents about how the company accounts for
various costs for current and disconnected cable TV customers.</LD>
<LD>   Charter said it intends to cooperate in the probe, which was
initiated by the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of
Missouri. David Andersen, a Charter spokesman, said the issues under
investigation are similar to those raised in a series of shareholder
class-action lawsuits accusing the company of inflating its
subscriber figures and stock price with deceptive bookkeeping.</LD>
<TE>   Charter, the nation's No. 4 cable provider, has denied the
allegations. Charter has about 500,000 subscribers in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the company announced an increase in its reserve for
uncollected customer accounts held at the end of last year. Charter
also said that it had tightened its collection policies relating to
these "marginal" customers and that it expected to remove about
120,000 of these customers from its basic customer count in the first
quarter of this year. Charter later increased that figure to 145,000
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the federal inquiry appeared to be focusing not just
on subscriber disconnections but also on how Charter accounts for
capitalized labor--one of the issues that arose in the meltdown of
cable firm Adelphia Communications Corp. Adelphia disclosed a series
of accounting errors, including improperly reporting millions of
dollars in ongoing labor expenses as capital expenditures, a step
that inflated the firm's reported cash flow and revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury is not the only source of questions about Charter's
accounting. Last month, Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen
downgraded her rating of Charter, citing concerns about certain
revenue it booked. Charter books some revenue from subscribers who
use its cable modem service but not cable television service as
revenue from "basic cable" customers. And unlike other cable
companies, Charter counts programming launch fees--paid to Charter by
cable network operators--as advertising revenue, Reif Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Charter executives swore to the accuracy of the
company's financial results in a statement filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission as part of a new law.</TE>
<TE>   Charter is burdened with $17 billion in debt, and Allen has said
he is considering taking the company private as part of a
restructuring to cut the debt load. On Friday, Charter's stock fell
18 cents to $2.53 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this summer, Charter was hoping to broaden its share of
the lucrative Los Angeles cable market by buying cable systems from
Adelphia. Allen has coveted the local systems since 1999, when
Charter lost them in a bidding war.</TE>
<TE>   But now, with Charter's stock sinking and the specter of
accounting woes, Charter is considered out of the running. "Our
balance sheet will not support any acquisitions at this time,"
Andersen said.</TE>

<HD>Metabolife Inquiry Renews Focus on Safety</HD>
<DH>Health: Makers of ephedra-containing diet products have
enjoyed booming sales in recent years. Critics continue to call for a
ban.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government's criminal investigation into Metabolife
International has once again cast a spotlight on makers of ephedra
dietary supplements--an unregulated, multibillion-dollar industry
that has generally prospered despite criticisms and is looking to
capitalize on heightened concerns about obesity.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department said Thursday that it was investigating
whether the San Diego-based company lied about the safety of ephedra,
an herbal stimulant that speeds the heart and suppresses appetite.</LD>
<LD>   Although Metabolife is the leading producer of ephedra
supplements--which have been linked to dozens of deaths in recent
years--a number of companies have recently introduced copycat
versions or spruced-up products to compete with Metabolife's top
seller, Metabolife 356.</LD>
<TE>   "The need to lose weight for many of us has never been more
apparent," proclaims Cytodyne Technologies on its Web site promoting
the company's Xenadrine supplements. "In fact, according to a
recently published report by the International Obesity Task Force,
approximately 55% of the American population is now overweight or
obese."</TE>
<TE>   Cytodyne, based in Manasquan, N.J., is among about a dozen major
makers of dietary supplements with ephedra. Ephedra makers overall
enjoyed booming sales--from $500 million in 1995 to about $3 billion
by the end of the decade, according to consultant reports. Privately
held Metabolife said in 1999 that its revenue exceeded $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, however, the pace of ephedra sales appears to have
slowed with the declining economy and negative publicity, including
the move by some sports organizations such as the National Football
League to ban the substance, according to industry analysts and
executives.</TE>
<TE>   "We're less in ephedra than a few years ago," said Bill Rizzardi,
a spokesman for Twin Laboratories, a nutritional supplement company
in Hauppauge, N.Y., that makes an ephedra capsule called Metabolift.</TE>
<TE>   Although Twin Laboratories has struggled, most major makers of
ephedra have continued to enjoy brisk sales, said Wes Siegner, an
attorney for the Ephedra Education Council, a Washington-based
organization made up of several major ephedra makers and retailers.
Siegner said he was unaware of any major retailer that has pulled
ephedra off its shelves.</TE>
<TE>   General Nutrition Cos., a specialty retailer that carries ephedra
products and is a member of the Ephedra Education Council, would not
comment about the investigation into Metabolife but issued a
statement saying it believes that ephedra-containing products are
safe when used appropriately.</TE>
<TE>   But the Justice Department's criminal probe into Metabolife has
raised hopes among some longtime critics who have urged the
government to ban ephedra.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, federal officials have been frustrated by the lack
of cooperation from Metabolife and others in the industry to better
assess the health effects of ephedra supplements.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday, when the Justice Department announced its probe of
Metabolife, the company agreed to turn over about 13,000 health
complaints it has received from consumers of Metabolife 356.
Metabolife has denied making false statements.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the Public Citizens Health
Research Group in Washington, this week renewed calls for banning
ephedra. Wolfe lamented the fact that businesses were continuing to
market ephedra.</TE>
<TE>   "A responsible company shouldn't sell products like this," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Housing Starts Dip; Confidence Stable</HD>
<DH>Indicators: CPI rises slightly in July. Reports suggest a
fragile economic recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS FINLEY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer sentiment stabilized in early August after a stock
market rout, but housing starts slipped in July from lofty levels
even as mortgage rates fell, reports said Friday, suggesting an
uneven and fragile recovery.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, consumer inflation remained tightly contained in
July, a separate Labor Department report said. That leaves the
Federal Reserve, already worried about further weakness, room to cut
interest rates if the economy stalls.</LD>
<LD>   But for now, a halt in the slide in consumer sentiment provided
some hope that consumer spending, which drives about two-thirds of
the economy, will extend its aid to an economy beset by weak
corporate profits, sluggish growth and a delay in job creation after
last year's recession.</LD>
<TE>   "Looking forward, consumers remain cautious in their outlook,"
said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital
Management in St. Louis. "But with consumer confidence stabilizing,
income rising and an improving stock market, consumers should be
spending at a moderate pace."</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index edged down
to 87.9 in early August, compared with a final 88.1 in July, holding
at its lowest level since November.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, housing starts fell for a second straight month in
July but remained at historically robust levels, down 2.7% to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.65 million units, the Commerce
Department said. That followed a revised 2.7% drop in starts in June
to a 1.7-million annual pace.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer price index, the main U.S. inflation gauge, rose just
0.1% last month after an identical advance in June, the Labor
Department said. Excluding food and energy prices, which can vary
widely from month to month, the core CPI was up 0.2% in July after a
0.1% climb in June.</TE>
<TE>   The summer's slide in consumer sentiment halted in early August as
Americans took heart from the stock market's recovery from five-year
lows struck in July.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in housing starts in July came after a strong showing
in the spring and early summer and was mostly expected given that
some builders were likely to turn more cautious in light of the stock
market's woes.</TE>
<TE>   Historically low interest rates have helped spur housing along for
most of this year. Rates on 30-year conventional mortgages fell to
6.49% in July, said mortgage financer Freddie Mac. Rates fell further
in August, hitting a record low of 6.22% in the week ended Aug. 16,
compared with 6.92% one year earlier. Meanwhile, housing permits, an
indicator of planned construction, were off only a bit in July,
dipping 0.5% to a 1.7-million annual clip.</TE>
<TE>   The CPI rose 1.5% for the 12 months ended in July and was up 2.2%
over the same period when stripped of food and energy costs.</TE>

<HD>Frequent-Flier Credits Probably Not Affected by Turmoil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the recent turmoil in the airline industry, experts say
frequent-flier program members should consider their hard-earned
miles to be safe.</LD>
<LD>   With US Airways Group Inc. seeking bankruptcy protection and
United Airlines threatening to follow suit, many frequent fliers are
wondering about the credits they've accrued, even though both
carriers have assured members they will continue operating as usual.
Together, the two airlines have 60 million members in their
frequent-flier programs.</LD>
<LD>   "The gut reaction when you hear that an airline's in trouble is to
hurry up and cash in all of your miles," said Randy Petersen, editor
and publisher of Inside Flier magazine. "But the truth is,
frequent-flier programs are the very last thing any airline is going
to mess with. They're too valuable.... These are the people they want
to keep happy."</LD>
<TE>   The stock of frequent-flier miles has been valued at nearly $500
billion, making it the next-largest currency in circulation after the
dollar. More than 13 million award tickets were given away by U.S.
carriers in 2000, with the majority coming from American Airlines and
Delta Air Lines.</TE>
<TE>   But as many frequent fliers know from experience, using their
points as freely as cash is not always easy. Since Sept. 11, the
major carriers have cut the number of flights and, in many cases,
have tighten restrictions on mile usage. And just this week,
American, the nation's largest carrier, announced plans to cut
seating capacity by 9% and will eliminate first-class seats on
certain international flights, which will make it harder for frequent
fliers to get upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   But the airlines, even those that are struggling financially, will
continue to hand out free tickets because, experts said, it is the
carriers' relationships with corporate partners, which market the
free miles, that have made the programs so lucrative.</TE>
<TE>   Petersen estimates that United Airlines will make $1 billion this
year selling free miles to such firms as telephone companies and
credit card issuers, which then offer miles, or points, to their
customers who use their services. More than half of all free miles
are now accrued through methods other than flying.</TE>
<TE>   "If they mess with the [frequent-flier] program, they're losing
income and they'll be flying planes for free," said Petersen, who has
900,000 miles accrued on United. "That's the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, United Airlines sent notices to its 40 million members
assuring them that miles would continue to be earned as usual, and
that "you will continue to reap the benefits of Mileage Plus
membership."</TE>
<TE>   When US Airways filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this week,
a similar notice was sent to members encouraging them to continue
flying and banking their rewards. US Airways spokesman David
Castelveter said there has been no change in the airline's
frequent-flier program, and the carrier has noticed no change in its
enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen an unusual amount of activity with people cashing
in their miles or pulling away from us," said Castelveter, noting
that of the airline's 20 million frequent-flier members, 4.5 million
are active. "We believe they have faith in what we've told them all
along, that we're hoping to emerge from our current status by the
first quarter and we're going to continue taking care of them like we
always have."</TE>
<TE>   Experts pointed to previous airline bankruptcies as examples of
the frequent-flier programs' viability. Eastern Air Lines, Pan
American World Airways and Trans World Airlines all had millions of
frequent-flier miles outstanding when the firms finally collapsed.
The miles were quickly absorbed by other carriers that wanted to add
the members to their rosters, said Joe Brancatelli, an online
business travel columnist.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, if you look at this historically, frequent fliers have
never been completely abandoned when an airline goes out of
business," he said. "If anything, those miles are the most stable
thing going on out there right now."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some program members make the mistake of assuming an
airline is a bank. Accrued miles are never guaranteed and are always
subject to the carrier's policies, which can change with little or no
notice, Brancatelli said. For that reason, he advises frequent fliers
to use their free miles whenever enough credits have been earned to
get them where they want to go--regardless of whether the airline is
in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "Frequent-flier miles are like an unregulated lottery," he said.
"They are not protected, and you are never in complete control of
them, because ultimately the airlines can always do with them
whatever they want. That's why they're not in any more jeopardy now
than they normally are."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Tomlinson, a San Diego frequent flier who sells cable
networking services and has 120,000 miles accrued with United and
Delta, said the financial concerns of the airline industry probably

<HD>Expected Gemstar Shift Boosts Stock</HD>
<DH>Media: Part-owner News Corp. wants to replace the CEO at
the Pasadena-based company, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. shares rose 31% on expectations
that a new chief executive will change strategy at the maker of
software to run on-screen television program guides.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Pasadena-based company rose $1.11 to close at $4.65
Friday on Nasdaq. Gemstar's stock has fallen 43% since June 21, when
the company lost a legal dispute over patents related to its
program-guide software.</LD>
<LD>   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. owns 42% of Gemstar, which also
publishes TV Guide magazine, and wants to replace Gemstar Chief
Executive Henry Yuen, sources said. Yuen has relied too heavily on
patents and the threat of patent lawsuits to get customers to license
his software, investors said.</LD>
<TE>   A Gemstar spokeswoman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar said Wednesday that it will delay reporting second-quarter
earnings and restate 2001 earnings. The company said it's no longer
assured that it can collect money it has claimed that
Scientific-Atlanta Inc., a maker of TV set-top boxes, owes in
licensing fees. Gemstar lost a patent dispute to Scientific-Atlanta
before the U.S. International Trade Commission in June.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar previously had recorded as revenue more than $100 million
that it claimed Scientific-Atlanta owes. Gemstar said it will record
costs of the litigation as an expense. It previously had capitalized
those costs as a long-term investment.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it will remove about $20 million in revenue
it had recorded from its TV Guide division in last year's financial
results. It said the audit committee of its board is examining
whether the company properly recorded revenue in other transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Yuen and Chief Financial Officer Elsie Leung filed statements with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday saying they were
unable to certify the company's past financial statements. A new SEC
rule required chief executives and finance chiefs to file sworn
certifications of financial reports by the deadline Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch wants to replace Yuen with Gemstar Chief Operating Officer
Jeff Shell, a former head of News Corp.'s Fox cable TV networks, the
person familiar with the situation said. Shell couldn't be reached
for comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District has renewed its lease at
Wells Fargo Center in downtown Los Angeles for 225,000 square feet of
space in a deal valued at $24 million, said building owner
MaguirePartners.</LD>
<LD>   The district, which has housed numerous administrative departments
in the Bunker Hill complex since 1995, will remain in the skyscraper
for 39 additional months. By then, space will become available in the
district's newly acquired headquarters building just west of the
downtown core as current tenants' leases there expire.</LD>
<LD>   The school district considered relocating its Bunker Hill staff
into space at the Transamerica Center on the southern edge of
downtown before deciding to remain at Wells Fargo Center.</LD>
<TE>   MaguirePartners will spend about $3 million on office improvements
and include eight months of free rent as part of the agreement.</TE>

<HD>Major Indexes Gain for Second Straight Week</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Signs of a bottom and the passing of
certification deadline encourage investors. For the day, stocks are
mixed and yields surge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turning cautious after Wall Street's two-day rally, investors left
stocks mixed Friday, taking some profits in blue-chip issues and
doing some buying in the tech sector. Still, the major stock indexes
scored their second straight weekly advance, an achievement not seen
in five months.</LD>
<LD>   "The market is snapping back now, showing more resiliency," said
Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, yields on Treasury securities spiked as investors
abandoned the low-yielding sector in favor of the rebounding equity
market.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 40.08 points, or
0.5%, at 8,778.06. The loss was attributable largely to profit taking
after the Dow's two-day gain of 335.75 points.</TE>
<TE>   Broader market indexes finished mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
rose 16 points, or 1.2%, to 1,361.01, having advanced 75.73 points in
the previous two sessions. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 1.48
points, or 0.2%, to 928.77.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by about 9 to 7 on both Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange. Trading volume was modest.</TE>
<TE>   The market's three major gauges claimed their second straight
weekly advance, a feat they last accomplished in the two-week period
ended March 8. Nasdaq was the week's biggest winner, surging 4.2%.
The S&amp;P had a weekly advance of 2.2%, while the Dow gained 0.4%. For
the S&amp;P 500, it was the fourth straight weekly gain--something that
hasn't happened since March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Market observers attributed the recent gains to signs that the
market found a bottom in late July. The advance also reflected
investors' relief that most of the nation's biggest companies were
able to comply with a government deadline Wednesday to certify their
financial results. Although the final count has not been completed,
hundreds of chief executives affirmed their companies' numbers with
few delays or restatements.</TE>
<TE>   "The passage of Aug. 14 should not be underestimated," said Henry
Cavanna, investment manager at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll look back over time and see the issue of corporate trust
was the pinnacle of worry and concern. [This deadline] removes a
worry from the market and that's a positive."</TE>
<TE>   Wachtel said that stock prices finally are appearing attractive to
investors and that investments that had been more in favor, such as
bonds and money markets, are becoming less attractive.</TE>
<TE>   "Stocks relative to everything else look reasonable," Wachtel
said. "You have institutional investors saying, 'Too many bonds, not
enough stocks,' and individuals saying, 'I am not sure about stocks,
but how long can I live on 1%' " in certificates of deposit or money
markets.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note
plunged to levels not seen since the early 1960s. It has rebounded a
bit, rising Friday to 4.32% from Thursday's close of 4.18%.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an unwillingness to drive yields to the lows hit earlier
in the week," said Mike Kastner, fixed-income manager at Deutsche
Bank Private Banking. "We're too low" in yields across all
maturities.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointing economic reports, including weaker-than-expected
consumer sentiment and a decline in home construction, contributed to
Friday's lackluster tone on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   On a positive note, the Labor Department reported that consumer
inflation inched up 0.1% in July, lower than the 0.2% rise that
analysts were expecting.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, the dollar was mixed, rising against the
Japanese yen while weakening against the euro. Oil prices remained
above $29 a barrel for a second day, rising 27 cents to $29.33.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Technology got a lift from Texas Instruments, rising $1.69 to
$21.99 after reconfirming its third-quarter earnings outlook. Also,
Analog Devices rose $2.50 to $26.50 after the microchip maker said
revenue stabilized despite a sluggish semiconductor market. A key
index of chip stocks jumped 6.4%, and No. 1 chip maker Intel rose 14
cents to $18.75.</TE>
<TE>   * Dell Computer also gave tech shares a boost, rising 39 cents to
$27.53 the day after it reported a 27% increase in second-quarter
profit.</TE>
<TE>   * Retailers were mixed. Target rose 44 cents to $35.54, the day
after reporting a 27% increase in second-quarter profit. But American
Eagle Outfitters tumbled 98 cents to $14.79 after Morgan Stanley
downgraded the stock. And Gap slumped $1.34 to $11.66 after the
largest U.S. specialty apparel retailer posted a drop in earnings and
said its early August sales were below projections.</TE>
<TE>   * Alcoa dragged on the Dow with a drop of 66 cents to $24.77 after
Morgan Stanley cut the company's earnings estimates, citing concern
about economic weakness and recent slackness in aluminum prices.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Blast Feds on Port Talks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accusing the federal government of tipping the scales in favor of
shipping companies and importers, pro-union legislators Friday
denounced the Bush administration's intervention in the labor talks
underway at West Coast ports.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union packed
a hearing at the Port of Los Angeles to cheer on lawmakers irritated
by what they said was Beltway meddling in contract negotiations
between the union and the employer group representing the carriers.</LD>
<LD>   The contract, which covers more than 10,500 union members at 29
West Coast ports, expired July 1, and bargaining on a new agreement
has been contentious. The ILWU has complained that the Labor
Department has been pressuring the union to settle, with federal
officials going so far as to suggest that Navy personnel could be
brought in to operate the ports to protect national security in the
event of a strike. That, in turn, has annoyed pro-labor lawmakers who
say the Bush administration's threats have impeded a settlement by
giving carriers a reason to avoid bargaining.</LD>
<TE>   "My message to the Bush administration is: 'Stay away,' " said
Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), who was invited to address the hearing,
which was organized by state lawmakers. Harman's congressional
district includes the port community of San Pedro. Federal
intervention "is the wrong thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Times this month that they have outlined four steps the Bush
administration or Congress might take in the event of a West Coast
port strike or slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   The most likely option would be for President Bush to declare a
national emergency, then invoke the Taft-Hartley Act that would delay
a strike for 80 days. Other options include sending Navy personnel to
run the ports, breaking the union's West Coast bargaining unit or
backing legislation that would impede the union's ability to strike.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of federal intervention has incensed some California
lawmakers. Friday's meeting at the Banning Landing Community Center
in Wilmington was a joint hearing of the California Senate and
Assembly committees devoted to labor issues. Sen. Richard Alarcon
(D-Sylmar) and Assembly member Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood) made
clear their displeasure with the Bush administration's attempts to
inject itself in the bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   "They should be spending more time going after corporate crooks on
Wall Street instead of going after hard-working people on the docks,"
Alarcon said, to cheers from crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Although the hearing resembled a pro-union rally, one
representative of the employers' group, the Pacific Maritime Assn.,
did speak on behalf of the shipping lines. Jack Suite, director of
contract administration for the PMA, said federal officials'
"monitoring" of such high-profile negotiations isn't unique, and that
the union isn't the only party feeling the heat from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration has put tremendous pressure on the PMA to be
responsive to the ILWU," said Suite, who denied that the employers
are dragging their feet or spoiling for a strike. "We fully expect to
negotiate the contract to a successful conclusion without a strike or
a work disruption."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. Ports from San Diego to Seattle move about
$300 billion worth of goods a year, accounting for about 7% of the
nation's gross domestic product and supporting 1.4 million American
jobs. One university study estimates a West Coast dock strike could
cost the U.S. economy as much as $1 billion a day.</TE>
<TE>   Conflicts center on outsourcing of union jobs and the introduction
of labor-saving technology. The last West Coast port strike was 1971.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Williams Cos., already facing a probe on sham energy transactions,
was asked by the Securities and Exchange Commission for information
on energy-trading cash reserves, revenue and volumes.</LD>
<LD>   The commission also asked for information June 24 on earnings from
energy transactions in California and other Western markets, natural
gas pipeline owner Williams said in a regulatory filing.</LD>
<LD>   Williams and rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Resources Inc.
had been asked by the SEC for information on "round-trip" trades.
Regulators are investigating whether some traders manipulated power
and natural gas prices during California's energy crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., closed down 9 cents at
$2.53 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Disney Sued Over Disclosure of Pooh Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. is being sued by a shareholder who says the
second-largest U.S. media company didn't disclose that it was being
sued.</LD>
<LD>   Disney shareholder Aaron Kohn filed a securities fraud suit in
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles that claims the company didn't
reveal a 1991 lawsuit over Winnie the Pooh franchise rights until a
May Securities and Exchange Commission filing.</LD>
<LD>   The suit claims Disney shares fell 42% from May 15 to Aug. 5 "as
the case received greater and greater publicity." Disney shares
actually rose 1.5% in the three days following the SEC filing.
Analysts have blamed the slide in Disney shares since then on
disappointing results at the company's theme parks, ABC network and
movie studio.</LD>
<TE>   Disney spokesman John Spelich said the suit has no merit.</TE>
<TE>   The Winnie the Pooh case received media attention in January,
before Disney's SEC filing, when a judge unsealed volumes of
documents in the dispute between Stephen Slesinger Inc. and Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Burbank-based Disney rose 71 cents to $15.86 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Television networks and studios lost a bid to dismiss a suit by
consumers who say the media companies might try to stop their use of
Sonicblue Inc.'s ReplayTV recording device.</LD>
<LD>   In June, five ReplayTV users sued the media companies, claiming
that they had been accused of piracy and would be harmed if the
studios succeeded in blocking features that let viewers share video
over the Internet and skip TV commercials.</LD>
<LD>   The media companies in October sued Sonicblue, claiming the device
violates copyright law. A federal judge in Los Angeles on Thursday
issued an order allowing the ReplayTV owners to join that lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   In seeking to dismiss the suit, the media firms said they don't
plan to sue individual users and have no way of knowing the identity
of the 5,000 owners of ReplayTV 4000 models.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Television set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc. said it would
cut its work force by about 400 jobs, or 6%, to help save about $40
million annually.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the reductions are effective immediately, although some
will occur over the next several months, the Lawrenceville, Ga., firm
said. The positions being eliminated are companywide.</LD>
<LD>   In July, the firm posted a fiscal fourth-quarter loss against a
year-ago profit, hurt by charges associated with the bankruptcy of a
customer, Adelphia Communications Corp., and weaker shipments of
digital set-tops.</LD>
<TE>   Scientific-Atlanta, one of the largest makers of consoles used by
cable TV subscribers to receive programming and interactive services,
last month cut 1,300 jobs in Mexico, or 16% of its work force.</TE>
<TE>   Scientific-Atlanta rose 49 cents to $13.90 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Fewer Foreigners Visiting U.S.</HD>
<DH>The drop-off is being felt acutely at Yosemite and Grand
Canyon</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The decline in foreign visitors to the U.S. this summer has
significantly slowed the tourism industry's recovery, and some
regions have been feeling the effect more than others, especially at
national parks in the West.</LD>
<LD>   This has helped create a rare opportunity for more Americans to
book trips to the Grand Canyon or Yosemite national parks on short
notice. Some have been able to snag discounted rooms at park
lodgings.</LD>
<LD>   But the dearth of international travelers has the tourism industry
worried. Spending by foreigners has been soft in the U.S. since Sept.
11, and this week industry leaders launched lobbying efforts to get
government help in trying to shore up the nation's $100-billion
international travel market.</LD>
<TE>   For national park officials looking at dwindling visitor numbers
in what is usually the busiest month of the year, such efforts are
particularly timely. Many acknowledge that they underestimated how
the drop in foreign tourists--who account for at least 40% of the
Grand Canyon's total visitors, for example--would affect the summer
season, banking on a much-anticipated increase in drive-in traffic
from nearby regions to cover any shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Although trips by car are up 7% to 10% at the most popular Western
parks and campsites still have waiting lists 30 names long, vacancies
at lodges and hotels remain easy to find, as cancellations by
international groups and tour operators opened up blocks of coveted
rooms. At the Grand Canyon, international tour bus arrivals are down
35% this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 50 to 100 rooms available every day for the rest of the
year," said Bruce Brossman, a spokesman for Xanterra Parks &amp; Resorts,
which operates the lodges in Grand Canyon National Park. "They'll
eventually sell out, but they'll go to people just walking in on a
weekend whim. You don't need a year to book ahead anymore. You may
not even need an hour."</TE>
<TE>   At Yosemite, park spokesman Scott Gediman said that 90% of the
summer's visitors are coming from within California and that any
vacant hotel rooms inside the park are being snatched up at the last
minute by travelers taking a spontaneous trip.</TE>
<TE>   The number of overall visitors to Yosemite this year is down about
10%, Gediman said. July brought about 513,000 visitors, compared with
551,000 for the same month in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "What's different is driving around the park and seeing
practically no tour buses, but a ton of California license plates,"
he said. "It's pretty quiet. I think the word has gotten out that
Yosemite is a different kind of place this year."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, international visitors spent $103 billion in the U.S.
Last year, spending by foreign visitors dropped to $91.1 billion, a
number that is expected to rise slightly to $94 billion in 2002.
Overall, the number of international visitors is expected to increase
2% this year, with the majority of that growth coming from Mexico,
said Ron Erdmann, a spokesman for the Commerce Department's tourism
industries division.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the nation's $546-billion tourism industry plan to ask
Congress this fall to create a national tourism agency to market the
U.S. to international travelers. The group would allow individual
states and destinations to compete in international markets they
wouldn't normally be able to reach, said William Norman, president of
the Travel Industry Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In the West, where foreign visitors spend nearly $23 billion a
year, tourism officials hope the extra government help comes soon.
Although the economic effect of this summer's lost tourism dollars is
not yet known, officials said whatever boost they received in
regional traffic from visitors planning shorter trips closer to home
will hardly make up for the drop in international visitors, who tend
to take longer vacations and spend more.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of [international] visitors, we are just sputtering
along out here," said Mark McDermott, chairman of the Western States
Tourism Policy Council. "When you consider that 2 million of the 4
[million] or 5 million visitors to the Grand Canyon each year come
from other countries, you get some perspective. We simply can't
afford to let them go."</TE>
<TE>   Traveler concerns about wildfires in the West probably have kept
visitors away, as well as the persistent belief that national parks
are always overcrowded, McDermott said.</TE>
<TE>   "Those two factors definitely haven't helped things this summer,"
he said. "We've done everything to get the word out that the fires
are down and the crowds are fine, but people usually have their minds
made up one way or the other."</TE>
<TE>   Via Adventures Inc., a tour operator that runs motor coaches
through Yosemite, has reduced its number of trips to six from 10 per
day, a spokeswoman said. And executives at Yosemite Concession
Services, which operates all of the park's food, gift and grocery
services and recreational activities such as bike rentals and rock
climbing excursions, said international tour bookings are down 30%
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Hales, a Yosemite Concession Services manager, said she
rarely hears the usual crowds of tourists speaking several languages
at the food court or inside Yosemite Lodge shops anymore. The park's
1,500 rooms, which range from tent cabins to full-service hotel
accommodations, are selling out more slowly than ever, she said.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom CEO's Future Is Tenuous</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Two directors, unhappy with John Sidgmore, seek a
new leader--and a buyer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER STERN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two WorldCom Inc. board members are urging other directors and
creditors to fire Chief Executive John W. Sidgmore, saying his vision
for bringing the telecommunications company out of bankruptcy
protection is flawed and the company should instead be shopping
itself to potential buyers.</LD>
<LD>   Sources said board members Max E. Bobbitt and Stiles A. Kellett
Jr. never fully supported Sidgmore. They have enlisted the help of
several creditors to oust Sidgmore, but the two men have yet to win
over the 10-member board.</LD>
<LD>   Sidgmore said he has no plans to step down.</LD>
<TE>   "I have the support of the majority of the board," Sidgmore said,
adding that he was fully aware of efforts to remove him by two
members, whom he declined to name.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over Sidgmore's future reflects the lingering
differences that exist inside the nation's second-largest
long-distance company since it pushed out Bernard J. Ebbers as chief
executive and chairman and later discovered that $7.65 billion in
expenditures had been improperly booked.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, parent company of Arlington, Va.-based MCI Group, is the
subject of several federal investigations. The company filed for
bankruptcy protection last month.</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the company said Bobbitt and Kellett have
met with creditors in recent weeks, seeking their support to replace
Sidgmore. One source said that a group of creditors and some board
directors already had interviewed a potential replacement for the
chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbitt and Kellett referred inquiries to their lawyers, who
either declined to comment or did not return calls.</TE>
<TE>   According to people familiar with Bobbitt and Kellett's thinking,
the two men find fault with Sidgmore's leadership of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Among Bobbitt and Kellett's biggest complaints is that Sidgmore
has not shared information about the company freely with other board
members.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore repeated Friday that he had no knowledge of the company's
accounting problems before they were discovered by an internal
auditor in May.</TE>
<TE>   Sources both inside and outside the company trace the strained
relations between Bobbitt, Kellett and Sidgmore to April, when the
board ousted Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources familiar with the board's actions on the
weekend of April 26, the directors initially voted to make Bobbitt
chief executive but quickly reversed their decision and chose
Sidgmore.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbitt gained the support of the board with his proposal to sell
the company to a regional telephone company such as BellSouth Corp.
or Verizon Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbitt's brief career as chief executive came to an end in just
hours, when he and Kellett called to inform Bert C. Roberts Jr.,
chairman of the board and a former chief executive of MCI.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources familiar with the conversation, Roberts
became irate and angrily rejected the decision, saying he would not
work with Bobbitt to sell WorldCom.</TE>

<HD>Bare-Chested Beijingers Feel Heat From the More 'Civilized'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Newspapers in the West are often bent on exposing cover-ups. But one
of China's most popular papers has mounted a campaign to do the
opposite: It wants to cover up the exposed.</LD>
<LD>   Its target is the scads of men in Beijing wandering around
shirtless, putting their often less-than-perfect physiques on public
display as they try to beat the heat.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever summer comes on, shirts come off in the Chinese capital.
But because the Olympic Games are due to be held here in 2008, the
Beijing Youth Daily says it's time for the city's male population to
start showing a little more modesty and a little less skin--to
become, as it says, more "civilized."</LD>
<TE>   In June, the paper launched a drive to shame offenders into
putting some clothes on. Nearly every day, it features a photo spread
of one or more bare-chested men caught on candid camera. The men who
find their scantily clad selves splashed in the paper's pages can
then go to the Beijing Youth Daily's office to claim a free T-shirt
proclaiming "Civilizing Beijing Begins with Me."</TE>
<TE>   Recent photos have shown men young and old, tall and short, fat
and thin, baring their torsos all over town.</TE>
<TE>   There are shirtless men milling in front of skyscrapers in
Beijing's business district. Old men sit topless in residential
alleyways, playing Chinese chess or just shooting (and enjoying) the
breeze. Men with tanned upper bodies fish in the lakes abutting the
Forbidden City. Others tool around on bikes.</TE>
<TE>   There's nary a washboard stomach in sight; these photos won't make
the cover of Men's Fitness. Pictures of well-fed guts, like that of
one man caught napping shirtless in a hammock, are embarrassingly
common.</TE>
<TE>   "Foreigners who visit always ask why there are so many half-naked
men in Beijing," said Cao Shui, a professor at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences in Beijing. "It's not civilized."</TE>
<TE>   Cao is compiling a study of Beijing's public image in advance of
the Olympics. There are more pressing image problems to address than
topless men, he says, citing such issues as the environment and the
fledgling service economy. But he sees value in the Beijing Youth
Daily's modesty campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing is no stranger to drives to improve behavior. Soon after
the Olympic Committee awarded the city the 2008 Summer Games in July
last year, the municipal government drew up a list of a dozen habits,
including spitting and swearing, that it wanted Beijingers to get rid
of. It set up "spiritual civilization" centers where people could
learn nicer manners.</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing Youth Daily recently conducted its own survey to
determine what most harms Beijing's image, and public expectoration
and exposure were identified as the top two problems. It decided to
tackle the latter.</TE>
<TE>   So far, said the person in charge of the paper's campaign--a woman
surnamed Zhang, who refused to give her full name--the response has
been "very warm."</TE>
<TE>   Community chalkboards in some neighborhoods, which usually extol
the virtues of birth control, now urge male residents to keep their
shirts on. The Beijing Evening News reported that 10,000 farmers in
the city's Tongzhou district signed a pledge to "Say Goodbye to Going
Topless."</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing Youth Daily has already handed out more than 2,000
T-shirts to the men displayed on its pages, to other bare-chested
guys who didn't quite make the cut for publication but who were
spotted by T-shirt-toting photographers and to the many willing
amateur photographers who have sent in photos, Zhang said.</TE>
<TE>   The paper tries to protect an offender's identity by printing a
black bar over his eyes. But people have recognized themselves and
neighbors with little difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   Not that everyone minds. The naked truth is that for many
Beijingers, going around topless--or, in another popular habit,
rolling one's shirt up to bare the midriff--is no big deal.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, they say, these practices are a long-standing tradition,
and a sensible one when the temperature hits the 90s and the heat
clings to you like a wet T-shirt anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everybody can afford air conditioning. This is the only way
to deal with the heat," said Guo Lin, 37, a factory worker who sat
shirtless outside his apartment building one recent afternoon. The
beginnings of a beer belly gently lapped over the top of his shorts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any problem with it," he added. "This is an old
Beijing habit. Of course I'll put on a shirt when I receive guests,
but on ordinary days, nobody cares or complains. My neighbors all do
the same, and so do my friends."</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing Youth Daily's shame-them-into-modesty campaign is
scheduled to run through the end of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it will have any impact beyond that remains to be, well,
seen.</TE>

<HD>Bush Answers GOP Foes of a War on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Policy: After ex-aide to his father assails idea of an
attack, the president acknowledges critics but says he will act
according to 'the latest intelligence.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush responded Friday to the increasingly contentious
debate among Republicans over what course he should follow regarding
Iraq, acknowledging the growing opposition to a military campaign to
remove President Saddam Hussein from power.</LD>
<LD>   The dissent spread this week when Brent Scowcroft, the White House
national security advisor during the administration of Bush's father,
warned that an attack on Hussein could jeopardize the war on
terrorism by angering allies whose support is critical.</LD>
<LD>   Several former officials close to Scowcroft said they doubted he
would have gone public with that posture without clearing the move
first with the senior Bush, heightening questions about the latter's
view on confronting Iraq. The former president has not commented
publicly, which has only fed speculation.</LD>
<TE>   "It's fair to say it's probably reflecting 41's thinking," said
one aide who served in the White House of the senior Bush, the 41st
president.</TE>
<TE>   "Scowcroft and [the elder] Bush move along on the same page," said
another Republican close to the former national security advisor.</TE>
<TE>   The 43rd--and current--president, told reporters Friday: "I am
aware that some very intelligent people are expressing their opinions
about Saddam Hussein and Iraq. I listen carefully to what they say.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen," he added, "it's a healthy debate for people to express
their opinion.... But America needs to know, I'll be making up my
mind based upon the latest intelligence and how best to protect our
own country plus our friends and allies."</TE>
<TE>   Writing in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Scowcroft, who
serves now as head of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board, interjected himself into a debate in which Vice President Dick
Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and others are
understood to be urging Bush to move forward with military action
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   By speaking out, Scowcroft had multiple goals, said a former
official with whom he consults. He strengthened the hand of Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell and others, particularly in the State
Department, who have urged caution. He "bucked up the president" to
resist pressure for military action. And he moved to slow down any
drive toward an invasion of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Scowcroft's words carry particular weight not only because he has
a close relationship with the Bushes--he was at the family summer
compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, in early July at the same time as
the president--but also because he was deeply involved in the conduct
of the Persian Gulf War against Iraq in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has said frequently that he has no specific plan to attack
and that no decisions have been made about Iraq. But he repeatedly
says he favors "regime change" there.</TE>
<TE>   Scowcroft, a retired Air Force lieutenant general, wrote under the
headline "Don't Attack Saddam" that Hussein "terrorizes and
brutalizes his own people" and is devoting "enormous effort to
rebuilding his military forces and equipping them with weapons of
mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "we need to think through this issue very
carefully."</TE>
<TE>   Scowcroft continued:</TE>
<TE>   "There is scant evidence to tie Saddam to terrorist organizations,
and even less to the Sept. 11 attacks. Indeed Saddam's goals have
little in common with the terrorists who threaten us, and there is
little incentive for him to make common cause with them. He is
unlikely to risk his investment in weapons of mass destruction, much
less his country, by handing such weapons to terrorists who would use
them for their own purposes and leave Baghdad as the return address."</TE>
<TE>   Describing the Iraqi as a "familiar dictatorial aggressor"
interested in his own survival in power, Scowcroft said "there is
little evidence to indicate that the United States itself is an
object of his aggression."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he said, attacking Iraq would risk destroying
the administration's global anti-terrorism campaign. A massive attack
on Hussein, he added, might lead the Iraqi leader to decide that he
had "nothing left to lose," provoking him to use weapons of mass
destruction. A likely first target would be Israel, which might
respond with nuclear weapons, "unleashing an Armageddon in the Middle
East."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, emphasizing twice that he would base any decision on how
best "to keep the world at peace," employing "the latest
intelligence," reiterated his case against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be no doubt in anybody's mind this man is thumbing
his nose at the world, that he has gassed his own people, that he is
trouble in his neighborhood, that he desires weapons of mass
destruction," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke with reporters outside the Crawford Community Center,
where he had thanked local volunteers for the support they provide
the White House during his visits to his 1,600-acre ranch seven miles
outside town. He is spending much of August here.</TE>
<TE>   The president was meeting at the ranch Friday with Condoleezza
Rice, his national security advisor and a Scowcroft protegee. She
served on the National Security Council staff under Scowcroft during
the first Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Rice, in an interview with the BBC that was broadcast Thursday,
said the outside world has an obligation to oust Hussein or face
inevitable global "havoc" perpetrated by his regime, thus making
clear she and her mentor have parted company on this issue.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld was expected to confer here with Bush next week.</TE>

<HD>Russia Denies Entry to Tibetan Leader</HD>
<DH>Policy: Moscow changes its mind on a visit by the Dalai
Lama, citing China's objections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>The Russian government reversed course Friday and denied a visa to
the Dalai Lama, complaining that the exiled Tibetan leader mixes
politics with religion to a degree unacceptable to China--and, by
extension, to Russia.</LD>
<LD>   "Evidence of this is, among other things, the inclusion in the
delegation of members of the so-called Tibetan government-in-exile,
artists and other figures," said Boris Malakhov, spokesman for the
Foreign Ministry.</LD>
<LD>   The ministry previously indicated that it would approve the visit,
which would be the Dalai Lama's first full official visit since the
collapse of the Soviet Union. The Tibetan leader made an unofficial
visit to Buddhist regions in 1992, and received a transit visa for a
journey to Mongolia in 1996. However, a similar request for a transit
visa was denied last year.</LD>
<TE>   "Account should naturally be taken of the position of the People's
Republic of China, whose leadership takes a strongly negative
attitude to the Dalai Lama's political activities," Malakhov said.</TE>
<TE>   China occupied Tibet in 1950 and remains wary of the influence of
the Dalai Lama, who fled the region after Chinese forces crushed a
rebellion in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Buddhists reacted strongly to the visa decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks as if China and its geopolitical interests are more
important to the Kremlin than the needs of Russian Buddhists--who
are, by the way, Russian citizens," said Antonina Kookuyeva,
president of the Friends of Tibet society in the republic of
Kalmykia, one of the stops on the Dalai Lama's canceled itinerary.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has about 1 million Buddhists, mostly in the southern
republics of Buryatia, Tuva and Kalmykia. They are descendants of
Genghis Khan, whose horde swept out of Mongolia and into Europe in
the 13th century, subjugating Russia for more than two centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Dulma Shagdarova, chairwoman of the Assn. of Traditional Buddhist
Communities, described the Russian decision as "outrageous." She
noted that the Chinese complain to other countries about the Dalai
Lama, but those complaints usually are ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "The Russian government has treated the Dalai Lama in a very bad
way--they canceled his visa as if he is some kind of a criminal who
should not be allowed to enter the country," she said. "I am lost for
words, really."</TE>
<TE>   The regime of President Vladimir V. Putin, who took office in
2000, has run hot and cold on relations with China. Early in his
term, Putin made special efforts to improve strained relations with
Beijing, arguing that an Asian-oriented foreign policy would be a
counterweight to American hegemony. That changed after Sept. 11, when
he expressed solidarity with the United States and Russia's relations
with China appeared to take a back seat.</TE>
<TE>   However, Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov is scheduled to visit
China next week to discuss trade and military cooperation, and Putin
is said to be considering a visit by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese Embassy in Moscow declined to comment on the Dalai
Lama's visa denial, referring to a statement posted on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dalai's words and deeds have showed that he is no longer only
a religious leader as he claims," the statement said. "On the
contrary, he has become [a] political leader engaged in long-term
divisive activities abroad."</TE>
<TE>   The Dalai Lama's representative in Russia, Navang Gelek, denied
that his delegation would have included members of the Tibetan
government-in-exile, which is based in India.</TE>
<TE>   "There would have been 10 members in the delegation and none of
them is a minister," he said. "It is unclear why the Russian Foreign
Ministry is saying such things. We do not understand why they had to
think up all this. We are very surprised."</TE>

<HD>German Floods Imperil Giant Chemical Complex</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Site of toxic substances is safe for time being,
officials say. But rivers are still rising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BITTERFELD, Germany</DL>
<LD>The swelling flood waters in two rivers threatened to overwhelm a
massive chemical industrial park here Friday as thousands of
volunteers raced against time to sandbag the site, where more than
1,000 hazardous compounds are produced and stored.</LD>
<LD>   The giant ChemiePark, which houses 350 factories, was in no
immediate danger of leaking its toxic wares into the swollen Mulde
and Elbe rivers and exposing millions of people downstream to health
hazards, environmental officials from the federal government and the
state of Saxony-Anhalt insisted.</LD>
<LD>   But with the Elbe still rising upstream at Dresden, where the
water level had surpassed all previous records, those struggling to
avert an ecological catastrophe acknowledged that the consequences
for Bitterfeld remained unknown.</LD>
<TE>   The chemical complex sits on the Mulde just a few miles upstream
from where that waterway flows into the Elbe, which in turn runs
through 300 miles of bucolic German territory before passing through
Hamburg and emptying into the North Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Both rivers were at record levels Friday and still being fed by
flooded tributaries, and engineers and hydrologists had little
historical guidance about where to try to shift the waters. Emergency
workers had blown up one retaining wall along the Mulde in hopes of
draining water into fields and away from the industrial park. But
officials said they couldn't be sure the move would be effective; the
river continued to rise, just more slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is critical, and we have no way of predicting when
it will stabilize," said Udo Pawelczyk, spokesman for Bitterfeld's
disaster response team. "We have nothing to go by from past
experience, as nothing like this has ever happened, and we don't want
to imagine what would happen if ChemiePark is overwhelmed."</TE>
<TE>   Over 45 years of reckless industrialization during the Communist
era, Bitterfeld had a reputation for being East Germany's filthiest
city. Even after a $2.7-billion cleanup and modernization of the
facilities once Germany was reunified in 1990, ChemiePark retains the
highest concentration of hazardous substances in the country. The
site employs 10,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Environment Minister Juergen Trittin dispatched his
emergency services chief, Christian Jochum, to oversee the civil
defense measures underway as the city struggled to shore up dikes
ahead of fresh swells making their way from Dresden.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of Bitterfeld's 16,000 residents had been evacuated
by nightfall, and the rest were packed and ready to leave if the
situation worsened, said Gerd Raschpichler, head of the disaster
response effort.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people secured their homes as best they could, took
their families to stay somewhere safer, then came back to help with
the sandbagging work," Raschpichler said. "It's heartening to see
people pull together like this to avert a crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Flood waters were so much higher than ever seen upriver in Dresden
that they wiped out measuring equipment and forced the closure of all
seven bridges in the Saxony capital, which straddles the Elbe.</TE>
<TE>   Dresden had already evacuated its historic Old Town and other
low-lying neighborhoods, and tens of thousands more residents left
their homes Friday as the seemingly unrelenting rise of the river
consumed homes and businesses, flora and fauna, and everything else
in its path. A terminal at the city's airport was converted to a
temporary hospital to accommodate about 150 patients, in the latest
wave of relocations from stricken facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The flood waters are still rising, and at the moment it's
impossible to say exactly how far it will go," said Dresden Mayor
Ingolf Rossberg. Officials said they expected the river to crest
early today, but similar predictions had been made and abandoned over
the previous 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called an emergency "flood
summit" for Sunday, inviting European Commission President Romano
Prodi and the leaders of Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to
Berlin for talks to coordinate relief. Prodi spent Friday in Prague,
the Czech capital, inspecting the flood damage there with Czech
President Vaclav Havel. No reliable assessment of the losses was
possible, as the waters had yet to retreat to normal levels, but
officials said they would be in the double-digit billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Flood waters retreated for a second day in the Czech Republic and
Austria, and the Slovak capital, Bratislava, was thought to have come
through the worst of the Danube's flooding. But the Elbe's onward
rush threatened to spread destruction over the weekend to the German
city of Magdeburg, capital of Saxony-Anhalt, and to new stretches in
Brandenburg state just a few miles east of here.</TE>
<TE>   The death toll from the weeklong disaster that has swept Central
Europe rose to 103 on Friday with the discovery of two drowning
victims in the Czech Republic and one a few miles from here.</TE>
<TE>   The evacuations in Bitterfeld proceeded calmly, with most
residents leaving by car to stay with relatives or friends in safer
locations. Fewer than 1,000 needed to use buses brought in by
soldiers. The city center, with its sturdy brick houses and restored
19th century landmarks, was a ghost town except for the volunteers
deployed to oversee the exodus.</TE>
<TE>   While there was little sense of panic, even amid the furious
sandbagging along the river and at a crisis headquarters just outside
the city, some environmental activists accused officials and the
chemical makers of dangerous indifference to a looming disaster.</TE>
<TE>   The commercial ChemiePark complex was neither prepared for a
worst-case scenario nor keeping local officials fully informed about
what chemicals were on the premises, Greenpeace chemicals expert
Manfred Krautter contended.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about substances that can be highly explosive if
shaken up by the water," Krautter warned. "According to workers
there, production was continuing even with dangerous substances like
chlorine."</TE>
<TE>   The environmental group demanded urgent measures to secure the
compound's factories and warehouses, and specifically accused Bayer,
one of the world's biggest chemical producers, of moving tankers
filled with flammable liquids away from the threatened area only
after the environmental agency informed local media.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer responded with insistence that none of its Bitterfeld
operations presented "a security risk" and said its operations were
either halted or "on standby and could be immediately shut down."</TE>
<TE>   Pawelczyk, the disaster response team spokesman, said emergency
workers were confident that they would have sufficient warning of a
dangerous rise in the water level because the swells making their way
north from Dresden were taking hours to reach nearby Dessau, where
the Mulde and Elbe converge.</TE>
<TE>   "We're told there's no imminent danger from the ChemiePark, and we
have to believe that," said Simone Jentzsch, 36, a child-care worker
taking a break from filling sandbags. "If I thought there was a risk
of all that stuff getting into the water, I would have taken myself
far away from here."</TE>

<LD>Israeli soldiers destroyed two houses belonging to suspected West
Bank militants Friday and reportedly arrested a Palestinian whom they
link to the shooting death of an Israeli baby last year.</LD>
<LD>   A senior aide to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
left Friday for consultations in several Arab capitals as
Israeli-Palestinian security talks hit a stalemate and violence
continued.</LD>
<LD>   The military announced that it blew up the house of Iyad Sawalha,
an Islamic Jihad member whom Israel holds responsible for planning a
suicide attack in which a bomber blew himself up in a car next to an
Israeli bus June 5 in the northern Israeli town of Megiddo. The
attack left 17 passengers dead.</LD>
<TE>   Residents of the village of Kafr Rai near the West Bank city of
Tulkarm said 12 people were rendered homeless after troops flattened
the two-story house overnight. Sawalha was in hiding elsewhere,
according to the army.</TE>
<TE>   Troops in Anabta, also near Tulkarm, knocked down the family home
of Murad abu Asal, who blew himself up Jan. 30, wounding two Israeli
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has demolished at least 20 homes of suicide bombers and
suspected militants since late July in an attempt to dissuade other
Palestinians from carrying out attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court upheld the policy Aug. 6. The Palestinians and
human rights groups denounce the practice as collective punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Israel regularly demolished militants' homes--more than 400 of
them, according to the Israeli rights group B'Tselem--during the
Palestinians' 1987-93 intifada.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government, which had largely halted the practice
since the creation of the Palestinian Authority, renewed the
demolitions amid the current uprising.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said on its Internet site that the
army on Friday arrested suspected sniper Sudki Zaro, whom Israel
linked to the killing of 10-month-old Shalhevet Pas. The army refused
to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Israel had said Shalhevet was shot in the head March 26, 2001, by
a sniper as she lay in the arms of her father in the divided West
Bank city of Hebron. The shot came from a hill in the
Palestinian-controlled part of Hebron, Israeli officials said at the
time. Her father was wounded in the leg.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Palestinians and Israelis have been meeting for days to
work out a plan for easing tensions, so far making little progress.</TE>
<TE>   Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian Cabinet minister, left Friday on a trip
to Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt to brief leaders of Arab states
seen as key Mideast mediators about the meetings with the Israelis, a
Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity.</TE>

<HD>Invigorating Homecoming for Pope</HD>
<DH>Visit: John Paul arrives in Poland appearing relatively
strong and offering a message of hope to his struggling countrymen:
'Fear not!'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KRAKOW, Poland -- Pope John Paul II arrived here in his homeland
Friday on a sentimental journey that from its first moments seemed to
boost the morale of both the frail, ailing pontiff and this
economically troubled nation.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing at the door of his airplane with his face lighted by a
happy smile, the 82-year-old John Paul seemed invigorated at being
home. He walked down the steps of the plane and delivered a 25-minute
arrival speech in a slow but clear voice.</LD>
<LD>   The pontiff declared the motto of this pilgrimage to be "God, rich
in mercy." He went on to link that with his religious agenda while in
Krakow, 25 miles from his hometown of Wadowice, and with the wish
that Poland's economic transformation from communism to capitalism be
marked by greater concern for those who have fallen behind.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the message of divine mercy that I bring today to the
nation and to my countrymen," he declared: "Fear not!"</TE>
<TE>   Although John Paul's arms shook--he suffers from symptoms of
Parkinson's disease--and his age was evident, the relative strength
he displayed came in sharp contrast to a May journey to Azerbaijan
and Bulgaria. On that trip he was lowered from his plane by a lift,
had aides read most of his speeches and often mumbled when he spoke.</TE>
<TE>   His difficulties prompted growing speculation that he might resign
the papacy. He has made it clear he has no desire to do so, but the
Vatican has been unable to stamp out rumors that he might step down
during this trip to Poland and simply stay here.</TE>
<TE>   In what looked like an effort to end such talk, John Paul referred
in his arrival speech to "these three days of my stay in my
homeland." He will return to Rome on Monday after a series of
appearances, including presiding over an open-air Mass on Sunday that
about 2 million people are expected to attend.</TE>
<TE>   This is John Paul's ninth trip to Poland as pope. On each of his
last two journeys, in 1997 and 1999, there was much speculation that
each might be his last visit home as pontiff. People again expressed
such fears Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe this is his last visit, and I really want to see him," said
Leslaw Kaczor, 38, a Krakow businessman who came with his wife and
two sons to catch a glimpse of John Paul at the church residence
where he was staying. "Just seeing the pope, people feel hope. There
are very few people in the world who have such an influence on
others."</TE>
<TE>   President Aleksander Kwasniewski, welcoming John Paul at the
airport, acknowledged that many people here are disappointed with the
country's 13-year-old transition from communism. Poland is suffering
from a double-digit unemployment rate and a sharp slowdown in
economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Democracy and a market economy, which in themselves are great and
desirable gains, can also be the source of many problems that have to
be overcome," Kwasniewski said. "Many people are jobless and many
Polish homes suffer poverty....The Polish people need support,
fortitude and hope, which you, your holiness, have been sharing with
us with such great consistency and generosity over the decades.</TE>
<TE>   "I also trust that this visit will fortify not only us here in
Poland, but also your holiness, that we can pass on to our great
compatriot this huge energy, this special strength and support that
flow from millions of loving hearts.... May it be the Polish miracle
cure for pain and fatigue."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul has played a key role in the transformation of Poland, a
heavily Roman Catholic nation, since his first journey back as pope
in 1979, when he prayed for God to "send forth your spirit and renew
the face of the Earth, of this land."</TE>
<TE>   Those words were seen as part of the inspiration for the creation
a year later of the Solidarity trade union movement, which eventually
brought about the collapse of communism in Poland.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that many Polish families, especially the largest ones,
and many unemployed and elderly people are carrying the weight of
social and economic change," John Paul said Friday. "I wish to tell
all of them that I spiritually share their burden and their fate."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul also joked about sitting down more than the other
dignitaries present.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to apologize," he said. "The president is standing. The
cardinal [Krakow Archbishop Franciszek Macharski] is standing. And
I'm sitting."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the evening, the pontiff appeared at a window of the
archbishop's residence--John Paul's home from 1964 until he was
elected pope in 1978--to greet a mostly youthful crowd of
well-wishers.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome home!" shouted the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody did not know, it's Franciszkanska 3," John Paul
replied, giving the residence address in a way that indicated he
still considers it home.</TE>
<TE>   "We love you!" responded the crowd, chanting the phrase.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy that he told people, 'Do not be afraid,' that God is
above all those forces of evil that make us sad, apathetic and
hopeless," said Julita Mendyka, 39, a Catholic boys school employee
from Warsaw. "I'm happy also that he's so full of wit and so lively,
that he shows his adversaries that he's absolutely able to lead the
church and doesn't have to resign."</TE>

<LD>The city of Los Angeles still takes heat for "stealing" the water of
the Owens Valley nearly a century ago, turning a verdant farm area
more than 200 miles away into a virtual desert. Today, the valley is
a recreational paradise, spared from sprawl because the city owns
most of the land.</LD>
<LD>   But look where San Francisco gets its water: from Yosemite
National Park. The city's O'Shaughnessy Dam created a reservoir that
inundated 300 vertical feet of Hetch Hetchy Valley, which rivals
Yosemite Valley, about 15 miles to the south. Naturalist John Muir
fought the dam desperately but lost when President Theodore Roosevelt
signed the law authorizing the project in 1913. The dam was finished
10 years later and the water is shunted to San Francisco through a
160-mile-long pipeline system.</LD>
<LD>   Every now and then, environmentalists, whitewater enthusiasts or
mere admirers of serene beauty cry out to tear down the 312-foot dam
and restore Hetch Hetchy, with its El Capitan-like rock buttresses,
meadows and waterfalls. To Muir, it was "one of nature's rarest and
most precious mountain temples."</LD>
<TE>   San Francisco officials dismiss the idea as impossible. Now Hetch
Hetchy restoration advocates are forcing them to reevaluate that
diagnosis. The city is launching a program costing nearly $4 billion
to overhaul its aging water system. Nearly half the money would come
from a proposed bond issue to be decided by San Francisco voters this
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Several activist groups are demanding that city officials study
the feasibility of removing O'Shaughnessy Dam as part of the
improvement project. If the city refuses, they will campaign against
the bond issue among an electorate known for its tree-hugging
tendencies.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a former mayor of San Francisco,
says tearing down O'Shaughnessy would be one of the worst things that
could happen. In truth, no one knows what the effect would be. The
study would cost $600,000 to $1 million and would analyze alternative
means for storing the water, replacing the lost hydroelectric power
and restoring the valley and the Tuolumne River.</TE>
<TE>   Dam foes note that Hetch Hetchy contains only 25% of the city's
water storage and that space could be found in downstream reservoirs.
In fact, the reconstruction project envisions enlarging the Calaveras
County reservoir to hold twice the water stored in Hetch Hetchy.</TE>
<TE>   Replacing the lost water and power would be complicated and
costly, but it could be done. Would it be worth it? Consider the
value of Yosemite Valley to the nation. Think of the possibility of
having a second such valley, free of cars and development, that would
be the temple of nature John Muir saw before the dam was built. That
too would be priceless.</TE>

<CX>   Hetch Hetchy Valley--An editorial in Saturday's Times incorrectly
said the bill authorizing construction of O'Shaughnessy Dam in
Yosemite National Park was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in
1913. The legislation was signed by President Woodrow Wilson. In
1908, Roosevelt's secretary of the Interior issued a permit for the
project, but opponents blocked work until Congress approved
construction.</CX>

<LD>The Koran is a holy book to millions, including many of the Arab
Americans who volunteered to translate for the CIA after Sept. 11.
Great, peace-loving men including Mohandas K. Gandhi have quoted from
its pages. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill now wants
incoming freshmen and transfer students to read an annotated portion
of the Koran and then discuss it in small groups when the school year
starts.</LD>
<LD>   Such brief, thought-provoking, often timely summer reading
assignments have become a standard tool for stimulating young brains
during college orientation. But the North Carolina House of
Representatives will have none of it and has banned funding for the
project in a rough draft of the state budget.</LD>
<LD>   Some representatives say promoting discussion of the Koran is
inappropriate after 9/11. Others say the assignment would violate the
separation of church and state.</LD>
<TE>   We think they're wrong on both counts and worry that they may be
using insincere sensitivity and false concern for religious freedom
to hide simple bigotry.</TE>
<TE>   Since Islamist extremists slammed planes into the World Trade
Center and Pentagon, government efforts to thwart terrorists have cut
deep into the Constitution's protections of individual rights. Most
of these incursions involve due process and search and seizure.</TE>
<TE>   So far, officials for the most part haven't manhandled the 1st
Amendment protections of free speech and religion. North
Carolina--the first colony to formally call for independence from
Britain--should know better than to lead such a dubious charge away
from liberty.</TE>
<TE>   The university is not endorsing Islam but rather is engaging in
scholarly pursuit. Just as the Bible provides many of the cultural
underpinnings for the West, so the Koran does for the more than 1
billion Muslims on the planet. Understanding Islam adds depth and
complexity to students' intellectual grasp of the tumult unfolding
from Israel to India, Malaysia and the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Religious texts, as a rule, are rich, complex and loaded with
contradictions. The Koran is no exception. A close reading--at least
of some translations--will turn up bellicosity, anti-Semitism and
what many might interpret as clear antagonism to such democratic
values as the separation of church and state. We would be appalled if
any university, to massage multicultural good feelings on campus,
glossed over the troubling parts of any book.</TE>
<TE>   In North Carolina, however, legislators seem to be doing the
opposite. One lawmaker objected to allowing freshmen to read about
"our attackers." Another called the Koran "evil." Such ignorance
threatens not only academic freedom but the constitutional freedoms
the founding fathers fought to achieve. To broaden their world view,
students should read the Koran. So should the North Carolina
Legislature.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The rash of recent kidnappings in Southern California has a fearful
public hunting for new solutions. One of the most popular proposals
has been to put maps on the Internet showing the areas where
convicted sex offenders are living. Maybe some parents who look at
these maps will feel more prepared, but it's a tool with limited
usefulness and the potential for abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Under the state's Megan's Law, named for a New Jersey kidnapping
victim, the California public already has access to a load of data
about sex offenders via telephone or at sheriff's offices.</LD>
<LD>   Give a name and other identifying information and you can find out
whether someone who worries you is a registered offender. Or you can
give a ZIP Code and view names, descriptions, criminal histories and
photographs of serious and high-risk sex offenders who live in that
area.</LD>
<TE>   The systems proposed or planned in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura
counties would post Internet maps showing circled areas where
registered sex offenders live. San Diego County, home of kidnapping
and murder victim Danielle van Dam, started its site last month.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, officials cannot give out offenders' names on the
Internet and cannot give exact addresses at all, to avoid mobs
hounding these ex-cons from place to place. But a look at the maps
already put on the Web by California police agencies shows that some
come close to giving addresses, with the circle covering just a few
houses. Curious people could learn the names of the residents within
the circle, make a phone call to the state and connect an offender to
an address. But if the maps are truly vague, what use are they?</TE>
<TE>   Given the high recidivism rates among serious sex offenders, the
Internet sites may help some parents feel they're casting a stronger
safety net around their children.</TE>
<TE>   The adults also should beware of the limits and hazards of Web
postings. None of the accused in the four recent high-profile child
kidnappings in California were registered sex offenders. (In the case
of a 4-year-old girl kidnapped in a Los Angeles park, no sexual
motive is suspected.) Only one lived near the kidnapping site. In
addition, the postings depend on sex offenders registering their
addresses regularly. Law enforcement agencies don't have the funds to
check them.</TE>
<TE>   Time will determine the value of Internet information on sexual
predators. What's beyond dispute is the worth of old-fashioned
strategies: securing homes, supervising children and educating them
about safety.</TE>

<LD>Former Maj. Gen. Augustin Bizimungu, head of Rwanda's armed forces
during a 1994 genocide, was transferred to the U.N. tribunal in
Tanzania to stand trial for his alleged part in the slaughter of at
least half a million people.</LD>
<LD>   Bizimungu was flown to Arusha, Tanzania, from Luanda, Angola, said
Kingsley Moghalu, spokesman for the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda.</LD>
<LD>   Bizimungu, accused of being one of the organizers of the 100-day
massacre in Rwanda, will soon appear in court to face charges of
genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes against humanity,
Moghalu said.</LD>

<HD>Flood Waters Burst Mexican Dams; 11 Die</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LA VENTILLA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Eleven people died when heavy rains brought down two dams in central
Mexico, and on Friday survivors searched for missing people and
waited for the rushing water to recede.</LD>
<LD>   When the 162-year-old dam in La Ventilla burst loudly Thursday
night, water poured through homes and streets, carrying cows, cars
and people trying to pull themselves to safety.</LD>
<LD>   Several villages in San Luis Potosi state were flooded, leaving
nine members of one extended family dead.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, police used wooden poles to gently poke through the
debris in search of Maria Guadalupe Orta, 42, and her 9-year-old
nephew Juan Eloy, both listed as missing.</TE>
<TE>   President Vicente Fox came to La Ventilla late Friday and offered
survivors condolences.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time the dam came down in La Ventilla, near Villa
de Reyes, another in neighboring Zacatecas state broke, killing a
73-year-old woman and a 3-year-old girl. The girl's mother was
missing and feared dead late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas--where the El Capulin dam unleashed
a torrent on the city of Villa Garcia--each declared a state of
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Romero, head of the communications center for the federal
Civil Protection Agency, said, "People are just waiting for the water
to go down in the worst flooded areas."</TE>
<TE>   Intense rain caused by tropical fronts and high humidity has
forced thousands of people to evacuate, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In La Ventilla, accordion music played softly against the hum of
bulldozers clearing mud and debris from the streets as members of the
Orta family and friends filed past nine coffins draped in flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Arturo Meade, a 63-year-old businessman, said his relatives ceded
the rock-wall and stone dam to a group of protesting farmers in 1997.
No one had maintained it since, he said.</TE>

<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>India's Defense Ministry plans to start production of a
nuclear-capable intermediate-range missile, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Agni missile, with a range of 1,500 miles, is undergoing field
trials and will be introduced into the arsenal of the nation's armed
forces, officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The most
advanced version of the Agni could hit most targets in neighboring
Pakistan and reach well into China.</LD>
<LD>   The government also announced that it would begin production and
deployment of the supersonic cruise missile Brahmos, which can be
launched from ships, submarines and planes.</LD>
<TE>   The Brahmos, with a range of 185 miles, can fly to a height of 9
miles at twice the speed of sound. If fired from near the Pakistani
border, it could easily hit locations throughout the
Pakistani-controlled portion of the disputed Kashmir region and many
other parts of the country.</TE>

<HD>7 White Farmers Charged in Zimbabwe; 27 Others Held</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe</DL>
<LD>The Zimbabwean government filed charges Friday against seven white
farmers who defied orders to leave their land, and it detained at
least 27 others, farming leaders said.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of others were told that they would be required to appear
in court soon, the leaders said.</LD>
<LD>   The move was the first coordinated government action against
hundreds of the 2,900 white farmers who defied orders to leave their
land by midnight Aug. 8.</LD>
<TE>   Under its land reform program, the government of President Robert
Mugabe has targeted for confiscation 95% of the properties owned by
about 4,000 white farmers.</TE>
<TE>   It says the seizures are a final effort to correct colonial-era
imbalances in landownership by giving white-owned farms to blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the farmers charged with violating the seizure laws were
freed on bail; the other two were freed without bail. They could face
jail terms of up to two years.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert E. Hunter says of the apparently imminent U.S. war on Iraq
("Iraq Needn't Be a Vietnam," Commentary, Aug. 12): "We must summon
knowledge and assume due humility. We must finally start widespread,
sustained, open, serious and uncensored debate on Iraq, free of cant
and emotion on all sides; we must be willing to accept permanent
commitment to responsibility in the region--and do all this before
the march to Baghdad."</LD>
<LD>   If a Gulf of Tonkin incident is again created or occurs by
circumstance, which led to Lyndon B. Johnson's quagmire with the U.S.
war on Vietnam, there will be no time for considering any options.
President Bush will act swiftly and attack, with or without the
required congressional approval--as we are now accustomed to. Two
U.S. wars on Iraq--one by the first President Bush and the other by
President Clinton--have clearly led only to one thing: more war. Give
peace a chance.</LD>

<TE>   Yorba Linda</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former NATO Ambassador Hunter admonishes critics of ongoing U.S.
plans for a war against Iraq by using Vietnam as an analogy. I
consider this to be a singularly poor choice for comparison with yet
another foreign policy adventure. He claims that we now have the
necessary knowledge, which is the "linchpin" of success, to avoid the
"quagmire" of failure due to "ignorance." The only valid parallel to
Vietnam that I see is that there is, as yet, no justification for a
preemptive attack on this sovereign nation.</TE>

<TE>   "Iraqi Official Rejects Return of Inspectors" (Aug. 13) gives one
pause. Before taking offensive military action against Iraq yet
again, perhaps it is time for us to clean up our own backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Purportedly, Israel has illegally possessed nuclear weapons since
the mid-1960s and chemical and biological weapons since the 1970s.
Rather than invading Iraq, should we not first send weapons
inspectors to Israeli nuclear facilities such as Dimona? If Israel
does indeed possess weapons of mass destruction, is it not time for
its government to admit publicly to such a stockpile, and should not
the U.S. subsequently encourage Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to sign
the Non-Proliferation Treaty?</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, Argentina, Brazil and South Africa all went
public with their nuclear weapons programs, willingly signed the NPT
and then disarmed. Israel, India, Pakistan and Cuba remain the only
nations in the world that have not yet signed the NPT.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than generating more hostility and hatred toward the U.S.
from the Muslim world by giving the appearance of applying a double
standard, would it not be more prudent to prove first that our allies
are in full compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty?</TE>

<TE>   A modest proposal intended to save lives, time and money:</TE>
<TE>   If indeed the Bush administration's goal is eliminating Saddam
Hussein, may I suggest the tried-and-true method of placing a bounty
on his head? Go all the way. Not a few million dollars, but make it
$1 billion! I suspect there would be plenty of individuals or groups
in Iraq ready, willing and able to do the deed and collect. It would
save countless lives and be a bargain.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, Hussein would be spending all his time wondering
which aide, which guard, which of his generals, is itching for a
billion-dollar payday.</TE>

<TE>   A nightmare, which Jack W. Germond addressed ("The Iraq Divide,"
Opinion, Aug. 11): Good old boys, starving for male bonding,
discussed Iraqi war techniques--talk warmed over from the fraternity
house or treehouse club. More frightened of each other than of the
end of the world, not one among them had the guts to shout:</TE>
<TE>   Is talk of an act of unprovoked aggression by the U.S. even sane?
Is it statesmanlike to not reflect deeply upon the recent Pax Christi
statement of the world's clergy? What are the views of our allies? Of
the American people? What if our hubris had caused us to attack the
former Soviet Union "because they had weapons of mass destruction"?
Sellers of or investors in jet fuel, bullets or body bags, or
reporters in search of a story, could never be our main source of
information.... Considering centuries of hate will be our legacy,
would it be in anyone's best interest? Or (let's hear it, all
together, fellows) would it be incredibly stupid? Thank you, Mr.
Germond.</TE>

<TE>   Since when has the U.S. government been given the authority to

would destroy they first make blind with power."</TE>

<LD>Huzzah to Neal Gabler ("Desperately Seeking Celebrity," Opinion, Aug.
11) for brilliantly arguing that the "bad apples" of corporate
America, as George W. calls them, are merely the fruit of more
fundamental blight: the institutionalizing of greed, the worship of
celebrity and the buccaneer (or is it wildcat?) spirit of current
corporate business.</LD>
<LD>   The next day's report on the grand jury probe of Kmart executives
demonstrates his argument. Whether or not the Kmart chief executive
and president are found guilty of illegal acts, the article makes
clear the moral and financial guilt of one more company that pays its
leaders millions of dollars in bonuses and stock awards while being
led into bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Although such publicity is depressing the stock market in which I
have my retirement investments, I am glad that the notoriety of
corporate crime is attracting attention to the worse obscenity of
corporate greed and folly.</LD>

<TE>   Celebrity status is added to reasons for disgraceful business
actions. But we should not overlook the enabling cause: legal advice.
Businesses routinely seek legal opinions. On request, and often
voluntarily, some lawyers prepare tomes on perceived loopholes, for
which they are handsomely rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   While lawyers are duty-bound to defend clients for past
actions--no matter how reprehensible--as instruments of the court,
this does not extend to pre-rationalizing improprieties. With
legislatures awash with lawyers this practice will likely continue.</TE>

<TE>   Re "As Economy Sours, Bush Takes It Out on Lawyers," Aug. 11:</TE>
<TE>   I think it is clear why President Bush hates trial lawyers. It may
be in part, as your article says, because "such attorneys make their
living suing big businesses, which tend to be cozy with the GOP"; but
that misses the real point in Bush's hatred of trial lawyers. Trial
lawyers are at the forefront in defending the average citizen from
the incursions being made by Bush and his administration into our
freedoms given us by the Bill of Rights.</TE>
<TE>   Americans must recognize Bush's lawyer-bashing for what it really
is. It is Bush's contempt for "we the people" and our struggle to
prevent him and his abusive big-business buddies from taking over our
government.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Scourge of the Amateur," Opinion, Aug. 11: With Bill Simon
Jr. just about out of the race for governor and Gov. Gray Davis'
continuing accumulation of a larger war chest on California's time,
two things should happen. Davis should share half of what he has
collected with the state treasury and a third choice should be added
to the election ballot--neither of the above.</LD>
<LD>   Sandy Friedfeld</LD>
<LD>   Rancho Palos Verdes</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Simon is indeed an amateur and, now, a scourge. His close friend,
former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, ought to help convince him to
resign from the race for governor of California. Riordan should also
bow out with no equivocation.</TE>
<TE>   This would allow the head of the Republican Party to appoint
Secretary of State Bill Jones to be the Republican candidate for
governor. The campaign could then go forward without rancor, with all
Republicans able to get behind Jones. Issues rather than
personalities would be the basis for the campaign, as is appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Karmen Brower</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since I am not registered as a Republican this year, I felt
powerless trying to find an alternative to Davis' outrageous campaign
contribution demands and marginal performance. His meddling in the
GOP primary to discredit Riordan and get his preferred opponent,
Simon, was one of the worst exhibits of legal political dirty tricks
on record.</TE>
<TE>   In my opinion, Simon's campaign is a shambles, and he has little
chance of being an effective governor even if he accidentally won.
Riordan probably was on the way to a close election before Davis
muddied his own hands to defeat him in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   California election laws allow changes to the ballot up to about
two months before the election. It's time for Simon to resign his
candidacy--time for him to get out of the way and let a viable
candidate run. Riordan might even win this election if he filed as
independent of party affiliation. This may be impossible--I haven't
found the filing deadline. But August to November is a reasonable
duration for a campaign, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Davis deserves defeat as a natural consequence of his unethical
solicitation of campaign contributions. I hope the groundswell of

<TE>   Another negative result of 9/11 is the candidacy of Simon for
governor. Riordan was a heavy favorite to win the Republican
nomination until New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had been
elevated to near-sainthood in the public mind because of his actions
in the aftermath of that disaster, was in a series of TV ads
extolling the virtues of his friend Bill Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Would Californians have been swayed by these ads prior to 9/11?
Should any thinking Californian be swayed by them now? Riordan will
have my vote, and given the dismal choice we have, I hope others will
take the time to write in his name.</TE>
<TE>   With the amount of unfavorable, if not scandalous, publicity Simon
has been receiving it is inconceivable that he could win an election
for dog catcher, much less governor of our state. The prudent action
would be for him to step aside and encourage a write-in vote for
Riordan.</TE>

<TE>   After all the recent revelations (no pun intended) of his shady
business dealings, Simon--as so many of his kind have done
before--decides to use his faith in God as both a shield and a
diversion. What an insult this is to those of sincere religious
conviction.</TE>

<LD>Re "Power Play: Big Energy vs. Solar," Opinion, Aug. 11: The backhand
maneuvering by the "big three" utilities in diluting Assembly Bill 58
proves once again that electricity is one commodity that should never
be privatized. A private utility in the business of generating
profits, not just providing a service, will not want to buy back
electricity at the same rate that it sells it, obviously--even if
that energy is clean and renewable. Market forces don't assign
different values to clean and dirty energy. Only society can do that.</LD>
<LD>   Luckily, solar energy generated on the roofs of private homes is a
no-brainer. It reduces global warming, pollution, infrastructure
needs, depletion of natural resources, dependency on foreign oil and
balance-of-payment deficits. It generates jobs in construction and
manufacturing.</LD>
<LD>   Solar panels on rooftops should be promoted with government loans
to homeowners, loans repaid with that same clean energy that those
panels produce and sold back to the grid at market rates.</LD>

<TE>   As the owners of a recently installed three-kilowatt solar
electric system that produces over 300 nonpolluting kilowatt-hours of
electricity from the sun every month, we feel we have made a small
contribution toward easing the energy problems facing the state. We
did so not only from altruistic motives but because of a unique set
of state and federal incentives (rebates, accelerated depreciation,
tax write-offs) and the provision known as "net metering," which
allows us credit on our Edison bill for the surplus energy we produce
during the day. We expect to pay off our investment in about three
years.</TE>
<TE>   All this will change if the power companies have their way in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   AB 58 would cut the net metering rate to less than that produced
by polluting sources of power (coal and gas), making the payoff for
this considerable investment much longer for homeowners and
small-business owners.</TE>
<TE>   This provision is in an amendment to AB 58, sponsored by Edison,
PG&amp;E and Sempra. It will discourage the solar option at the very
moment that it has become affordable for the larger population. AB 58
extends the state incentives past their expiration date this year,
but the lobbyists have inserted the "poison pill" of the rate
decrease to enhance their profit margin at the expense of present and
future solar installations.</TE>

<HD>Chicano Moratorium May Have Saved Lives</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"There Was a Time of Chicano Protest and Heat: Let's Not Forget,"
Commentary, Aug. 11: I too join Frank del Olmo in applauding the
Chicano Moratorium Committee, which organized a massive protest in
East Los Angeles on Aug. 29, 1970, against the Vietnam War and the
disproportionate number of Latinos being killed in that war. To
attack and ridicule the organizers of the upcoming commemoration, as
Del Olmo suggests some might do, is to be unaware of our past.</LD>
<LD>   In his book, "Working-Class War: American Combat Soldiers &amp;
Vietnam," professor Christian G. Appy notes, "Had the civil rights
movement not brought attention to racial disproportions in Vietnam
casualties, those disproportions almost certainly would have
continued." As a result of the criticism of the war by prominent
black leaders--Martin Luther King Jr. in 1967, and Malcolm X,
Muhammad Ali, Adam Clayton Powell and Dick Gregory, among others,
well before 1967--the Department of Defense "took steps to readjust
force levels in order to achieve an equitable proportion and
employment" of blacks in Vietnam. Appy also observes that a detailed
analysis of exactly what steps were taken has yet to be written. One
can reasonably infer that the political heat of the Chicano protest,
with some 20,000 people, was felt in Washington and probably saved
some lives.</LD>

<LD>The rush to pay INS Border Patrol agents and inspectors a salary more
in line with their colleagues in other areas of federal law
enforcement is a good idea ("Close the INS Pay Gap," editorial, Aug.
12). Another good idea would be to contact the agents and inspectors
who left with an open invitation to return to the INS. The Federal
Aviation Administration targeted Border Patrol agents and inspectors
because it could put them on the job in three weeks, as opposed to
having to send someone off the street to an eight-week federal law
enforcement academy.</LD>
<LD>   This shortsighted effort took officers who were trained over a
20-week period and further trained on the job from one the most
difficult and important positions we have in defense of our country.</LD>

<LD>   It is unfortunate that the leaders of Colombia did not raise taxes
earlier to support teachers, doctors and farmers to find solutions.
If they had, they would not need so many soldiers and police to fight

<LD>The Aug. 10 letter from professor James E. Moore II is very funny:
"Expensive rail systems serve few, reduce bus service and make
congestion worse, not better." This from a man who claimed (in the
1990s) that the Blue Line wouldn't work and wouldn't have many
riders. The Blue Line is one of the busiest light-rail lines in the
U.S., with about 65,000 weekday riders. The Red Line between North
Hollywood and Union Station takes 30 minutes any time of day or
night, rain or shine, and it carries about 145,000 riders each
weekday. And the Metro Rapid bus line from Universal City station to
Warner Center is heavily used and makes the trip to Warner Center in
about 40 minutes. So there is expanded bus service and improved
times, with higher ridership. Wrong again, Mr. Moore.</LD>

<TE>   Richard Shilling (letter, Aug. 10) mocks Gloria Ohland ("It's Time
for L.A. to Grow Up," Opinion, Aug. 4) for saying that if development
occurred along transit lines, residents wouldn't have to own cars. He
writes, "She surely can't live in Los Angeles. Does anyone believe
this stuff?"</TE>
<TE>   When my wife and I moved to Claremont, we sold her car and I
walked to the train station for my commute to downtown L.A. We did
that for over two years, with no complaints, except that our gas bill
was lower, we got rid of a car payment and I was in a good mood when
I got home after a long day at work, because I could relax on the
train on the way home. If there had been mass-density housing near
the station, more people would have had access to the train.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago we moved to Fullerton, and we told our real estate
agent that we would like a house within one mile of the train
station. His response was, "Fullerton has a train station?"</TE>
<TE>   Others claim that the trains have had no impact on traffic. Well,
from my selfish point of view, they have had a great impact--I'm not
in traffic anymore. Look at a map of Southern California and note the
regions served by Metrolink and the MTA. Not even 10% of the L.A.
area. If the L.A. area had trains serving even 25% of it, there would
be an impact on freeway traffic I'm sure. And doesn't it make sense
to serve mass population centers and points of interest (apartment
blocks, stadiums, malls, airports, museums)? This isn't rocket
science.</TE>
<TE>   Hmm, am I going to take the train to next week's Dodger game or to
LACMA? Without a train, I don't think so.</TE>

<LD>After reading Judith Backover's letter (Aug. 14) concerning the

her. My daughter-in-law is a well-educated and talented teacher. She
has five years of experience outside California, completed all her
requirements for an in-state credential and has a master's degree
with an emphasis on reading. She has been trying for a year and a
half to find a full-time position. Where are these jobs?</LD>
<LD>   How can a state whose test scores are so low when compared to
other less affluent states turn down such qualified people as Ms.
Backover and my daughter-in-law? Maybe too much of our taxpayers'

latest "politically correct" classes.</LD>

in May-June 2002. What an outrage for the students who were told the
program of group counseling "ran out of money."</TE>

<LD>"No to Privacy Profiteers" (editorial, Aug. 12) notes that SB 773
would stop insurance companies from selling confidential financial
information to other companies for marketing purposes. If that was
all Sen. Jackie Speier's (D-Hillsborough) bill did, insurance
companies would support the bill. Insurance companies do not sell
confidential financial information to anyone.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, SB 773 goes far beyond selling information. The
bill even restricts sharing of information among affiliate companies
with one parent company, even if the companies are operating under
the same brand name. In addition, the bill totally ignores how
companies are structured and creates an unlevel playing field by
favoring some companies over others. This is unfair and destructive
to the economy of the state. The bill will be confusing to consumers,
who will receive multiple notices from the same companies because of
the overlap of state and federal laws.</LD>

<HD>Roslyn Alfin-Slater, 86; UCLA Professor, Expert on
Nutrition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roslyn B. Alfin-Slater, a longtime UCLA professor and an authority on
nutrition, died Aug. 9 in Los Angeles following a stroke. She was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Alfin-Slater was known for her common-sense approach to diet and
nutrition. She co-founded the newsletter "Nutrition and the MD,"
written for doctors and nutritionists, and with Derrick B. Jelliffe
wrote the column Science, Food and Health in The Times from 1972 to
1982.</LD>
<LD>   She performed some of the early studies on the relationship
between cholesterol and essential fatty acid metabolism, and was
among the first to question the effects of dietary intake of
cholesterol on cholesterol levels in the blood.</LD>
<TE>   Alfin-Slater was the target of criticism in 1980, when she was
co-author of a report that downplayed the role of dietary fat in
heart disease. Critics said that the results were biased by
Alfin-Slater's and other co-authors' ties to the egg industry through
consulting or research support.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Alfin-Slater obtained a bachelor's degree
in chemistry from Brooklyn College in 1936. She later attended
Columbia University, where she earned a master's in chemistry and a
doctorate in biochemistry.</TE>
<TE>   She joined the faculty of UCLA's School of Public Health in 1959
and helped to found its program in public health nutrition. For
several years, she also taught a popular UCLA extension class called
Nutrition for Now, which emphasized practical guidelines on
vegetarianism, additives in food, fad diets and other topics.</TE>
<TE>   Alfin-Slater, who retired from UCLA in 1987, also was the author
of the four-volume series "Human Nutrition, A Comprehensive Treatise"
and the book "Nutrition for Today."</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Grant, a research
chemist at UCLA.</TE>

<HD>Jesse Brown, 58; Ex-Marine Headed VA Under Clinton</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown, a Marine who rose from
the fighting in Vietnam to lead the nation's second-largest Cabinet
agency, has died. He was 58.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who suffered from lower motor neuron syndrome, which
attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, died Thursday in
Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   "I am ill. I am very ill," Brown said during a speech two years
ago to the group he once headed, the Disabled American Veterans.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not afraid, nor am I bitter," he added. "The fact is, I am
grateful. I have enjoyed tremendous opportunities in my life, and
they have come to me because you were at my side, cheering me on."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas H. Corey, president of the Vietnam Veterans of America,
credited Brown with having improved the quality of veterans' health
care, expanding services for women and calling attention to the
plight of homeless veterans during his 4 1/2 years as head of the VA
in the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit-born Brown grew up in Chicago and graduated with
honors from Chicago City College.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, he enlisted in the Marines; two years later, he was
seriously wounded while on patrol in Danang. That injury left his
right arm partly paralyzed and became the motivating factor for his
life's work.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, Brown returned to Chicago to work for the Disabled
American Veterans, a 1.4 million-member advocacy group for vets with
service-connected disabilities. In 1973, he moved to DAV headquarters
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   While attending classes at Roosevelt University in Chicago and
Catholic University in Washington, Brown increased his
responsibilities at the DAV, moving from supervisor of the national
appeals office to deputy national service director and, in 1988,
executive director.</TE>
<TE>   He became a familiar figure on Capitol Hill, pushing Congress to
support legislation ensuring that veterans receive health-care
services and benefits programs.</TE>
<TE>   Brown was appointed VA secretary by President Clinton in January
1993 and served until July 1997.</TE>
<TE>   One of four blacks in the original Clinton Cabinet, Brown was an
ideal choice for the president, who had never served in the military
and was distrusted by many in the military because of his efforts to
avoid the draft during the Vietnam War, his promises to cut the
defense budget and his decision to lift the ban on gays in the armed
forces.</TE>
<TE>   At the VA, Brown liked to call himself the secretary "for"
veterans affairs, and said he had won several battles with Congress
because "we hold the high moral ground."</TE>
<TE>   Brown is survived by his wife, Sylvia; two children; a
granddaughter; and a sister. Funeral services will be Wednesday at
Washington National Cathedral, followed by burial at Arlington
National Cemetery.</TE>

<HD>A Deeply Spiritual Elvis Was a Man of Tao, Book Says</HD>
<DH>Study: Professor writes that the legendary singer embodied
the ancient Chinese idea, struggling to balance opposites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHELVIA DANCY</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirteen years ago, dejected after failing an important exam at a
Memphis scholarly conference, David Rosen sought refuge at the
gravesite of his childhood idol, Elvis Presley, at Graceland.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the stillness of the Meditation Garden, just beyond Lisa
Marie's swing set, Rosen found consolation ... and inspiration.</LD>
<LD>   "I had no idea why I was crying," recalled Rosen, now a Texas A&amp;M
University professor. "But I knew that something was going on here."</LD>
<TE>   That "something" grew into a years-long study of the spiritual
life of Elvis Presley, a spiritual life that Rosen believes is wedded
to the ancient Chinese religious concept of Tao--that there is a
central organizing principle of the universe--and one that the
Jungian psychoanalyst details in his book "The Tao of Elvis."</TE>
<TE>   Presley, who died a quarter-century ago Friday, "was a deeply
spiritual man," said Rosen, whose book is divided into reflections on
42 Taoist concepts--one for each year of Elvis' life. "I want people
to suspend judgment and approach Elvis with a spiritual attitude.
Elvis embodied the Tao--he was struggling his whole life to figure
out what was his unique purpose in life, struggling to balance
opposites"--opposites with parallels in Taoism.</TE>
<TE>   "Elvis was a man of Tao, who struggled to balance the opposites:
poverty and wealth, male and female, old and new, good and evil, king
and non-king, joy and sorrow, water and fire, dark and light, and
stillness and movement," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   The book argues that Elvis was more than sideburns and swivel.
Amid the fame-earning pelvis pumping and lip curling nestled traces
of Elvis' own spiritual quest.</TE>
<TE>   "He wore a Star of David, a Jewish spirituality symbol, and a
cross--a Christian spiritual symbol," Rosen said. "He always joked,
'I don't want to be left out of heaven on a technicality.' "</TE>
<TE>   On tour, Elvis traveled with his favorite books--among them the
Torah, Kahlil Gibran's "The Prophet," the Bible and "The
Autobiography of a Yogi."</TE>
<TE>   Not too surprising, Rosen said, for a man who once pined to join a
monastery and whose co-star in one film abandoned Hollywood to become
a nun.</TE>
<TE>   "Elvis read widely; he read the 'Tao Te Ching,' " Rosen said. "I
think he thought of himself as a deeply spiritual, religious
individual. He was open to all the religions of the world and all
spiritual concepts."</TE>
<TE>   Elvis' routine also included meditation ("Better than any drug I
know," he once said), particularly before performances.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't know that he was a member of the
Self-Realization Fellowship of Yogananda," Rosen said. "Elvis
meditated 30 minutes a day to get the ego out of the way so God could
speak through his songs. He thought God had a special use for his
voice."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, though rock 'n' roll was his bread and butter, Elvis never
took home a Grammy Award for his rock music. His three Grammys were
for sacred songs: "He Touched Me" (1972) and "How Great Thou Art"
(1967, 1974).</TE>
<TE>   "When you listen to his spiritual music, there's a natural
soulfulness that comes through," Rosen said, adding that Elvis' songs
were "manifestations of the Tao working through him."</TE>
<TE>   The professor wonders whether Elvis had much choice in the matter;
he says that Elvis' "very name means 'the force of God' in Hebrew,"
and his middle name, Aaron, was that of Moses' brother.</TE>
<TE>   Even in his dreams, Elvis connected with a higher power, Rosen
writes. In the mid-1960s, Elvis said he saw the face of Jesus Christ
in clouds above an Arizona desert.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Elvis said: "I know now. I've got to do something real
with my life. I want out. I want to become a monk and join a
monastery."</TE>
<TE>   After writing a will in 1977, Elvis "was shaken by a dream in
which he saw 'the face of God.' It manifested itself in the form of a
white so bright he almost couldn't look at it."</TE>
<TE>   "He gets this gift of light in his darkest hour," Rosen said. "And
that's a Taoist principle--that you find the light in the darkness."</TE>
<TE>   Elvis' death in 1977 marked the end of his struggle to reconcile
his opposites, the end of his struggle to reconcile his true self
with the weighty title "the King," Rosen said.</TE>
<TE>   "In our society we don't have royalty, so we often project our own
desire to link with the divine onto singing stars, movie stars, even
presidents," he said. "All of that was projected onto Elvis. But he
knew he was not a king, and that caused him a lot of mental anguish."</TE>
<TE>   Elvis' death has meaning for everyone, Rosen said.</TE>
<TE>   "The point of the book is: We don't have to go the way he did, but
we can learn from his life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a mirror for us to look into and draw projections from.
Instead of using Elvis to make that link to the divine--a lot of
people approach a sort of worship of him today--instead we can use
him to find our own link to the divine," Rosen said.</TE>

<HD>Zeppelin and Eminem Parodies? Word!</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you call the Christian parody band ApologetiX a novelty act,
you're about five centuries behind the times.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Luther, the 16th century church reformer, was the "Weird
Al" Yankovic of his day--minus the humor. The father of the
Reformation took scores of popular songs--hits of the 1500s--and
rewrote the lyrics to reflect biblical themes. His goal: to create
hymns that Protestant congregations could sing lustily from the pews,
something not done in the Catholic Church at the time.</LD>
<LD>   "Next to the Word of God, the noble art of music is the greatest
treasure in the world," Luther wrote. "It controls our thoughts,
minds, hearts and spirits. A person who ... does not regard music as
a marvelous creation of God must be a clodhopper indeed and does not
deserve to be called a human being; he should be permitted to hear
nothing but the braying of asses and the grunting of hogs."</LD>
<TE>   J. John Jackson, an evangelical Christian and co-founder of
ApologetiX, shares Luther's love for combining trendy music and
Scripture into consumer-friendly songs.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, Jackson has been rewriting lyrics of hits
from artists ranging from AC/DC to Led Zeppelin to an increasingly
appreciative audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep the Change," the 2001 CD by ApologetiX, climbed into the top
15 on Christian music's bestseller list with song parodies such as
"Babylona" (from the Knack's "My Sharona") and "The Real Sin Savior"
(from Eminem's "The Real Slim Shady").</TE>
<TE>   And hopes are even higher for the Pittsburgh-based band's seventh
CD, the 20-track "Grace Period" that will be released later next week
on the band's own label.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever an new album comes out, we jump on it," said Michael
Shishido, the program director at KAMI-FM (95.5), a Christian rock
station in Honolulu. "Our listeners just eat it up. A lot of the
words are relevant to a Christian, and it's just downright funny."</TE>
<TE>   As part of a nationwide tour, ApologetiX will give a free
performance at Saddleback Community Church in Lake Forest on Aug. 29,
playing songs from its latest release, including Train's "Drops of
Jupiter" ("Drop of Lucifer"), the Village People's "YMCA" ("YHWH," a
Hebrew reference for God), and David Bowie's "Suffragette City"
("Sufferin' Just Finished").</TE>
<TE>   Some of ApologetiX's songs are just this side of silly, like "Baa!
We're Lambs," taken from the Beach Boys' "Barbara Ann":</TE>
<TE>   Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa we're lambs</TE>
<TE>   Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa</TE>
<TE>   I'm a lamb--in God's hand--I'm a lamb</TE>
<TE>   He's got a flock of lambs who know Him</TE>
<TE>   Robbers cannot steal 'em from His hand</TE>
<TE>   Others, like "Cornelius" (Simon and Garfunkel's "Cecilia"),
earnestly tell the story of an obscure biblical character. Cornelius
was a Roman soldier whom the Apostle Peter converted to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   Cornelius--was favored by God</TE>
<TE>   He prayed to Him constantly, daily</TE>
<TE>   Oh, Cornelius was in the army</TE>
<TE>   A pagan believer from Rome</TE>
<TE>   Cornelius! An angel from God</TE>
<TE>   Came straight to the spot he was praying</TE>
<TE>   Oh, Cornelius! Acts 10 in verse 3</TE>
<TE>   The angel said Peter must come to your home</TE>
<TE>   And a few were written as mnemonic devices to help Christians
memorize parts of the Bible or names of the apostles. "La Bible" (its
genesis was Ritchie Valens' "La Bamba") takes listeners through all
66 books of Scripture, a godsend to Sunday School teachers
everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a concept that is incredibly cheesy," said Matthew Turner,
editor of CCM magazine, which reports on the Christian entertainment
industry. "But they do it really well."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Jackson, 38: "Whether you think it's hokey or not, you're
going to listen."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, a veteran of garage and bar bands who became a born-again
Christian in 1988, initially wrote the parodies for himself for two
reasons: to better his guitar playing and to learn verses of
Scripture by heart.</TE>
<TE>   He soon began playing the songs for his Bible study group, where
he hooked up with the future band's lead guitarist, Karl Messner.
After a few years, they formed ApologetiX (which took its name from
"apologetics," meaning a formal defense of the faith) and nervously
debuted in a Pittsburgh coffeehouse in 1992, unsure of how the crowd
would react to their mix of rock 'n' roll, Scripture and humor.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know how we would be received," Jackson said. "But the
people went nuts."</TE>
<TE>   Through word of mouth, ApologetiX was booked, usually for free, at
other events: gigs at churches, Christian bookstores and birthday
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, they made their first television appearance on
a local Christian show, and in 1997 released their first CD. The band
now has 15,000 e-mail subscribers who get updates on the group. The
band will play 100 dates on the road this year.</TE>
<TE>   The band also received a heaven-sent gift in 1994 from the U.S.
Supreme Court. The justices ruled that the rap group 2 Live Crew was
allowed to parody Roy Orbison's "Oh, Pretty Woman" without permission
and without paying royalties, allowing groups like ApologetiX to
record any song they liked if the lyrics were changed.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Yankovic, ApologetiX doesn't receive permission from the
spoofed artists or pay them royalties.</TE>
<TE>   "In the perfect world, there would be a compulsory licensing
system," Jackson said, "where you could pay a flat rate for any
song."</TE>
<TE>   But he says the legal red tape and artists' sensitivities make it
impractical for his band to get permission.</TE>
<TE>   And besides, he wonders, why is music so different from other
parody-rich fields?</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up reading Mad magazine and watching 'Saturday Night
Live,' " he said. "They make their living spoofing things. I want to
be seen as having some kind of talent and not looked at as some
parasite."</TE>
<TE>   The band, whose members are married and range in age from 32 to
44, can mimic a wide variety of artists from rapper Shaggy to Elton
John with varying degrees of accuracy. The hardest part, Jackson
says, is shoehorning biblical lyrics that rhyme into familiar
melodies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some meaty teaching in there," said Jackson, adding that
he has apologetics experts look over his lyrics for theological
errors and taste. "I don't want to offend God."</TE>

<HD>Jack Robertson, 85; Attorney in Palo Alto School
Integration Suit</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Robertson, 85, a Menlo Park lawyer who fought a decade-long
battle to integrate schools across district boundaries on the San
Francisco Peninsula, died of complications from a stroke Tuesday in
Palo Alto.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson was one of three lawyers who represented Margaret
Tinsley and 33 other parents in a landmark 1976 lawsuit against 10
districts, including the Palo Alto Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   A decade after filing the suit, Robertson and fellow lawyers Jerry
Marer and Sid Berlin won a settlement that allowed several hundred
minority students who would have attended schools in East Palo Alto
to attend schools in Palo Alto and other nearby affluent communities.</LD>
<TE>   Born in 1916, Robertson graduated from the United States Naval
Academy in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he served as an officer in the Naval Air
Transport Service.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, who studied law at Stanford University after the war,
was appointed to the school board in the Las Lomitas School District
in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, he was elected to the Sequoia High School District board
of trustees.</TE>

<HD>Winifred Watson, 95; Novels Found New Fame After 60 Years</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winifred Watson, 95, a popular writer in England in the 1930s and
early '40s who recently gained a new readership, died of undisclosed
causes Aug. 5 in a hospital near her home in northern England.</LD>
<LD>   Watson, who was born in Jesmond in northeast England, wrote six
popular and well-received novels.</LD>
<LD>   But she gave up writing during World War II while raising her son
and dealing with a home that had been bombed.</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, her humorous and risque 1938 novel, "Miss Pettigrew
Lives for a Day," was reprinted by a publisher in England.</TE>
<TE>   The story of a governess mistakenly sent to the home of a
nightclub singer instead of a family of unruly children won warm
praise the second time around.</TE>
<TE>   "Why has it taken more than half a century for this wonderful
flight of humor to be rediscovered?" a reviewer for the Guardian
newspaper wrote, describing "Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day" as "pure
Cinderella farce, with beaus, bounders, negligees and nightclubs."</TE>
<TE>   Watson's other books include "Fell Top," "Hop, Step and Jump,"
"Leave and Bequeath," "Odd Shoes," and "Upyonder."</TE>

<HD>Required Reading on Koran Provokes Bitter Battle</HD>
<DH>Islam: The University of North Carolina requirement for
freshmen incenses lawmakers and others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YONAT SHIMRON</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>In the 1920s, the North Carolina Legislature banned the teaching of
evolution in public schools. In the 1960s, state lawmakers banned
Communists from speaking on state-supported campuses. Last week, a
state House committee moved in to prevent the University of North
Carolina from requiring incoming freshmen to read a book on the
Koran--Islam's Scriptures.</LD>
<LD>   The action was the latest in what has been a growing controversy
since the university decided to require 4,200 new students to read a
book called "Approaching the Qu'ran: The Early Revelations," and to
discuss it at a two-hour orientation session next week.</LD>
<LD>   Radio talk shows are abuzz. The major TV networks have chimed in.</LD>
<TE>   And last month, the requirement that students read the book by
Michael Sells, a Haverford College professor of comparative
religions, led to a suit by a conservative Christian group against
the university in federal court on behalf of three unidentified
UNC-Chapel Hill freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit contended that the students' 1st Amendment right to
religious freedom was being violated. But on Thursday, a federal
court refused to intervene, allowing the university to proceed with
the orientation, in which students will meet to talk about the book
in groups of 20, led by 180 faculty members, administrators and staff
members.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the university has required incoming
freshman to read a book. Two years ago, freshmen were required to
read a book about the lingering effects of the Civil War. Last year,
they read about a Hmong immigrant's struggle with epilepsy and
American medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of this year's book was occasioned by the events of
Sept. 11. Robert G. Kirkpatrick, a professor of English at UNC-Chapel
Hill who headed the committee that selected the book, said Sells'
book had been chosen because it presented "in relatively short space
some fundamental but unfamiliar information in an intellectually
challenging and interesting way; it did not require a vast body of
previous knowledge ... and it was certain to provoke lively
discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Glover, the president of the Virginia-based Family Policy
Network, which sued the university, said the reading--which includes
35 suras, or passages, from the Koran and a CD with a collection of
recitations in the original Arabic--amounts to an exercise of
religion. "The question is whether they're indoctrinating students,"
Glover said. "The answer is yes. If you want to know Islamic
doctrine, that's indoctrination."</TE>
<TE>   Glover's arguments reached state legislators, who said that
teaching about Islam undermines national unity in a time when the
United States is at war. Legislators said they had heard from people
across the state who said they were offended by the choice of the
book.</TE>
<TE>   "If you stop and think about what 9/11 meant to this
country--homeland security, guards everywhere," said Republican state
Rep. Wayne Sexton. "Just think of what it costs to protect ourselves
from this faction, and here we are promoting it."</TE>
<TE>   In its action last week, the House Appropriations Committee voted
64 to 16 to deny public funding for the program unless all other
religions are offered in "an equal or incremental way." The debate
was heated.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere, it seemed, people were wondering whether the required
reading amounted to a violation of the 1st Amendment because it
required students to read Scripture. But several scholars rejected
that idea and suggested that it rests on a misunderstanding of court
rulings on 1st Amendment issues.</TE>
<TE>   When the Supreme Court banned prayer and devotional readings from
public schools in 1962 and 1963, it added a reminder that the study
of the Bible or religion, when presented objectively as part of a
secular program of education, was not only permissible, but part of a
broad-based education.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a good deal of misunderstanding of the court's
ruling," said Warren A. Nord, director of the Program in Humanities
and Human Values at UNC-Chapel Hill and an expert on the teaching of
religion in American education. "Probably the court ruling has a
chilling effect on schools and institutions. But if it has a chilling
effect, it also had a legitimizing effect on higher education."</TE>
<TE>   In a concession to opponents, the university is allowing students
who do not want to read the book, because it offends their religion,
the option of writing an essay explaining their objections based on
their faith.</TE>
<TE>   But William Van Alstyne, a professor of constitutional law at Duke
University, said the university does not need to provide an
alternative. The question is not whether the university can require
that the book be taught (he thinks it can) but rather how it is
taught. As long as the teachers approach the book with a critical
distance, there is nothing unconstitutional about it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "My impression is that, assuming the material is dealt with
academic detachment, it's very doubtful there's anything to this,"
Van Alstyne said.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching with academic detachment means that students can't be
told what to think or believe; they can't be told what's right or
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   But they can be taught what Islam teaches--just as they can be
taught what the Declaration of Independence or the Communist
Manifesto says.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't satisfied conservative Christian groups, many of whom
believe that their faith has been ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "Many conservative Christians look at the curriculum and don't see
their faith treated seriously," said Charles Haynes, a senior scholar
at The First Amendment Center, in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "The resentment comes out at times like this," he said. "They say,
'This is typical. We're always excluded. You won't assign the New
Testament, but here you are assigning the Koran.' "</TE>
<TE>   In this sense, the fight over the assigned reading is really not
about Islam as much as it is part of culture wars.</TE>
<TE>   Many Christians believe that their faith has been forcefully
removed from the public square and they don't want to see another
take its place.</TE>
<TE>   Glover admitted as much.</TE>
<TE>   "Taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for religious
indoctrination they don't believe in," Glover said.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of Americans find it offensive to teach about
Islam," he said.</TE>

<HD>Larry Rivers, 78; Bad-Boy Pioneer of Pop Art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Artist Larry Rivers, a high-profile pioneer of Pop Art and gadfly of
the New York art world who cultivated a multitude of creative
interests and a bad-boy persona during his 55-year career, has died.
He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Diagnosed with liver cancer a few months ago, Rivers died
Wednesday at his home in Southampton, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Rivers was a facile draftsman whose work formed a connection
between Abstract Expressionism of the 1940s and '50s and Pop Art, the
reigning style in the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   His paintings retained the sensual, brushy quality associated with
the earlier period, even as he pillaged mass media, family
photographs and art history books for images that he could rework
with his personal touch and idiosyncratic sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   "He was amazingly talented," said Paul Schimmel, chief curator at
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. "He believed deeply in
the tradition of painting, but somehow he knew that abstraction was
not going to be the way for him.</TE>
<TE>   "Early on, he realized that by looking back at the history of
painting he would find an extraordinary direction for his work, in
which Abstract Expressionism could go no further."</TE>
<TE>   Rivers was far from the only artist to look for a way out of the
entrenched style, but he attracted a lot of attention because his
approach was "outrageous," Schimmel said. "He took on icons. He was a
complete provocateur."</TE>
<TE>   Some of his best-known paintings are irreverent remakes of
celebrated paintings by Old Masters, including "Washington Crossing
the Delaware" by Emanuel Leutze and "Syndics of the Drapers' Guild,"
a group portrait by Rembrandt that Rivers spotted in ads for Dutch
Masters cigars.</TE>
<TE>   He also dealt with social history, racial tensions and ethnic
issues. One painting, "Black Olympia," turns the reclining white nude
in Edouard Manet's "Olympia" into a black woman. "History of Matzah:
The Story of the Jews," a huge three-part narrative painting that was
displayed at the Skirball Cultural Center Gallery in Los Angeles in
1999, highlights conflicts in Jewish history while indulging Rivers'
love of parody.</TE>
<TE>   One section, "The Last Seder," is a takeoff on Leonardo da Vinci's
"Last Supper."</TE>
<TE>   While Rivers' colorful personality often overshadowed his
artwork--and sometimes made him appear to be more of a showman than
an artist--he turned out to be prescient in a way that he couldn't
have predicted, Schimmel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Long before issues of personal identity were considered
appropriate as a subject of contemporary art, he brought it all in.
And he did it in a way that really unsettled people. The blurring of
his personal life, his sexuality and his identity in the work itself
was very progressive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among Rivers' most controversial subjects was his mother-in-law,
Berdie Burger. Rivers began living with her in 1953, after his
divorce from his first wife, Augusta Burger.</TE>
<TE>   Berdie cheerfully accepted his bohemian lifestyle, and he painted
her in the nude, making no secret of her wrinkles and sagging flesh.
She remained his favorite model until her death in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   Born Yitzroch Loiza Grossberg in New York in 1923, Rivers was the
son of Russian-Polish immigrants Shiah and Sonya Grossberg.</TE>
<TE>   He began playing the piano as a child, then switched to the
saxophone and began a career as a musician when he was a teenager,
primarily playing in jazz bands.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere along the way, his name was changed by a nightclub
comedian who introduced his group as "Larry Rivers and his Mudcats."</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, after supporting himself as a musician for several years
and doing a stint in the U.S. Army Air Corps, Rivers enrolled at the
Juilliard School of Music to study composition. Around the same time
he met painter Jane Freilicher, who was married to a fellow musician
and who introduced him to the world of visual art.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers continued to support himself as a musician, but began
studying painting with Abstract Expressionist Hans Hofmann in 1947.
With funding from the GI Bill, he enrolled in the fine arts program
at New York University, where he worked with William Baziotes and
other artists. He earned a bachelor's degree in art education at the
university in 1951, but didn't become a teacher, as he had planned.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he developed a freewheeling career that focused on
painting but encompassed music, stage design, acting, filmmaking and
writing poetry and prose. He recounted the entire adventure--along
with his sexual pursuits, self-confessed "Jewish guilt" and
"adolescent neuroses"--in "What Did I Do?," a no-holds-barred
autobiography published in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   In a review of the book, former Times art critic William Wilson
described it as "nearly 500 pages of confessional anecdote" by an
artist who "is apparently in love with himself."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Rivers' artwork was a fixture of the New
York gallery scene, appearing regularly at Tibor de Nagy Gallery and
later at Marlborough Gallery. His work is in the collections of major
art museums across the United States and in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   His most ambitious project, created in 1965, is "History of the
Russian Revolution," a 76-panel painting, inspired by Rivers' reading
of Isaac Deutscher's biography of Trotsky.</TE>
<TE>   It's either "the greatest painting-sculpture-mixed media of the
20th century, or the stupidest," Rivers said, after laboring on the
monumental work for six months. Composed of 30 paintings, poetry,
boxes, lead pipes, wooden rifles and a real machine gun, it is now in
the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife Clarice, from whom he had been
separated for several years. He is also survived by the poet Jeni
Olin, with whom he had lived for some time, two daughters, three
sons, two sisters and eight grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Stephen P. Yokich, 66; Former President of UAW</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephen P. Yokich, the firebrand former leader of the United Auto
Workers who was a leading force in a crippling strike against General
Motors Corp. four years ago but who significantly increased benefits
for union members, died of a stroke Friday in Detroit. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   Yokich had stepped down two months ago after leading the union for
eight years during a time marked by vigorous growth in the country's
auto market--though not in the union's membership. The union has
about 740,000 members today, down sharply from the late 1970s, when
membership was at a high of 1.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   "Our union lost a powerful and eloquent leader today, and working
people all over the world have lost a tireless advocate for economic
and social justice," UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said in a
statement.</LD>
<TE>   "Steve Yokich led our union during a period of unprecedented
economic and political challenges," Gettelfinger said. "He was
extraordinarily skilled at adapting to changing times and changing
circumstances, and extraordinarily committed to a core vision of
social unionism: organizing the unorganized, representing our members
as forcefully as possible at the bargaining table, and speaking out
as strongly as possible on social issues that affect all workers and
citizens, whether or not they are union members, in this country and
abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Yokich was known as a gruff, relentless fighter for workers'
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   He took pride in his Serbian and Irish heritage, which he liked to
say prepared him well for dealing with conflict.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't mince words, once describing a General Motors executive
as "yapping his chops" when talking about increasing the use of
preassembled modular components, which Yokich said would reduce union
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   He was also suspicious of the press, frequently asking reporters
who interviewed him what kind of car they owned, to see whether it
was union-made.</TE>
<TE>   But he was respected from outside the union for his
straightforwardness and devotion to his members, and for a wry sense
of humor that occasionally surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought unusual dedication and skill to the job," said Harley
Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at UC Berkeley and a
specialist on the UAW.</TE>
<TE>   "Yokich was very direct, and wasn't afraid to make tough
decisions," Shaiken told the Times. "He was concentrated on the fate
of the union. The centerpiece of his leadership was the bargaining
table and the fate of UAW members."</TE>
<TE>   The union "certainly benefited from his aggressiveness at the
bargaining table," said Daniel Kruger, a professor of industrial
relations at Michigan State University.</TE>
<TE>   But Yokich's tenure was marked by diverging demands from its
membership, Kruger said.</TE>
<TE>   "The older workers want more job security and benefits, and the
younger workers want more money," he said, and this was one of the
things that made it difficult to recruit new members.</TE>
<TE>   Industry leaders praised Yokich for his honesty and perseverance.</TE>
<TE>   "We have lost a respected business partner, a passionate leader in
community and union relations, and most importantly, a good and
honorable man," General Motors Chairman Jack Smith said in a
statement. "I value the friendship we forged and will miss his
dedication to his fellow UAW members and the auto industry."</TE>
<TE>   Yokich was "a good friend and advisor," Ford Motor Co. Chief
Executive Bill Ford said. "Steve also helped his members appreciate
the importance of focusing on the business. He made quality
everyone's top priority."</TE>
<TE>   As UAW president, Yokich served on the board of DaimlerChrysler
AG, formed by Daimler-Benz's acquisition of the former Chrysler Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew him as a tremendous leader and a passionate advocate for
working men and women everywhere," said Dieter Zetsche, chief
executive of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group. "He could be a tough
adversary but, at the same time, a good friend--and to gracefully
combine those two qualities is truly a hallmark of greatness,"
Zetsche said.</TE>
<TE>   Yokich was born Aug. 20, 1935, six days before the UAW was
founded.</TE>
<TE>   His parents were both trade activists, and young Stephen was taken
on his first picket line when he was 22 months old.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the UAW in 1956 when he was hired as a tool and die
maker apprentice at Heidrich Tool and Die Co. in Oak Park, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   After rising through the union ranks, he was elected UAW vice
president in 1980 and was reelected to four additional three-year
terms.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, he was elected UAW president, and reelected in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He led successful efforts to expand benefits for members,
including cost-of-living gains for retirees, health-care
improvements, tuition assistance for UAW dependents, improved
cost-of-living allowances and pension formulas, and a paid Election
Day holiday.</TE>
<TE>   He was a central force in the 1998 strike, partly over bargaining
issues but also "to send an unmistakable message to GM and the
industry as to how serious they were on the issues of globalization
and outsourcing" auto production to non-union workers, UC Berkeley's
Shaiken said.</TE>
<TE>   Yokich unsuccessfully tried to increase UAW membership through
organizing drives at Japanese-and German-run "transplant" factories.
Toyota, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz turned away overtures by the UAW,
sometimes by 2-to-1 votes.</TE>
<TE>   But "despite the enormous pressures which have crippled some
manufacturing unions, the UAW remains strong at the end of his
tenure, which is no small feat," Shaiken said.</TE>
<TE>   Yokich's survivors include his mother, Julia; his wife, Tekla; his
daughter, Tracey Yokich; his son, Stephen A. Yokich; and a grandson.</TE>
<TE>   The UAW will hold a public visitation Monday in Detroit. A private
family memorial service will be held later.</TE>

<LD>Amtrak used borrowed equipment to keep its trains running and is
hoping its premier Acela Express service will gradually resume
operations next week.</LD>
<LD>   All 18 of the high-speed trains remained out of service as Amtrak,
federal railroad officials and representatives of the manufacturer
finished a temporary repair plan for cracks underneath many of the
locomotives.</LD>
<LD>   Amtrak leased some locomotives and coach cars from commuter
agencies in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland.</LD>

<LD>President Bush said the economic forum the White House held in Waco
produced "some interesting ideas" from participants, among them
proposals to make it easier for people to increase contributions to
401(k) retirement funds and individual retirement accounts.</LD>
<LD>   The president said he also is considering raising the limit on
investment losses that can be written off on income taxes and cutting
tax rates on profits from the sale of stock and other assets.
Speaking with reporters as he left a small community center in
Crawford, near his 1,600-acre ranch, he was asked whether he might
produce a new set of economic proposals.</LD>
<LD>   "We're thinking about it," Bush said.</LD>

<LD>The lawyer for 700 relatives of Sept. 11 victims said his clients
will amend their lawsuit against Saudi officials and the Sudan
government to correct a mistaken demand for $100 trillion.</LD>
<LD>   The actual damages being sought are more than $1 trillion.</LD>
<LD>   The larger amount, contained in a lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S.
District Court in Alexandria, Va., and widely reported by news
outlets, was an error, said lead plaintiff's attorney Ron Motley.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know how $100 trillion got in there. Somebody probably

<HD>Bush May Whiff if He Mediates Dispute</HD>
<DH>Negotiations: As a fan and former team owner, he may be
tempted to get involved. But Clinton's efforts during 1994 strike
could prompt caution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>Unlike in labor disputes involving major industries with deep effects
on the national economy, the president has no formal place in
settling a baseball strike. However, as a former team owner,
President Bush occupies a unique position.</LD>
<LD>   With players setting a deadline of Aug. 30 in their labor dispute
with team owners, a strike would place Bush in a pressure-filled
situation unlike any a president encounters.</LD>
<LD>   Although he has not yet been asked to intervene in the impasse,
said White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan, a baseball strike would
bring him face to face with an emotional issue in which neither side
enjoys wide popular support. He would be expected to exert the
authority of his office--and his personal experience in major league
baseball--to resolve the dispute quickly enough to put the pennant
races back on track.</LD>
<TE>   Before winning the Texas governorship in 1994, Bush was a managing
partner of the Texas Rangers and was seen frequently in the stadium
seats near the field, greeting fans and eating hot dogs.</TE>
<TE>   His readiness to comment on baseball's problems--"A lot of fans
are going to be furious, and I'm one," he said Friday without being
asked--raised questions among veterans of past Democratic and
Republican administrations in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   One senior aide in previous Republican administrations said: "I
would never have done that. He's going to get himself sucked into
negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   It was a trap into which President Clinton fell in 1994, and a
move he quickly came to view as a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Confident of his ability to bring together the most aggressively
disputatious of parties and find a workable compromise, Clinton met
his match in the two sides of that year's season-ending baseball
strike. He quickly pulled the White House back from its initial
efforts to settle the strike.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling the experience on Friday, one senior Clinton aide said:
"I'm not sure it was one of the smarter things he did." The former
White House official cautioned Bush against wading into the fracas.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the disputes in the world right now, the one I'd least
want to be in the middle of is the Middle East. Second is the
baseball situation," he said. "As president, you don't have a choice
about the Middle East. Baseball is optional."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Bush should get involved in trying to resolve the
dispute, he said: "The short answer is 'don't.' "</TE>
<TE>   The former Clinton aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said it was needlessly risky for Bush to place himself in the middle
of an argument at this early date, and one for which no solution is
apparent. It would lessen the president's possible contribution
later, he said, and because he had been a team owner, the players
might view any White House role with suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   It is a political risk too.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you have a positive solution, stay away, because there'll
be no heroes in this endeavor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A baseball strike, or any such dispute involving professional
sports, is likely to draw wider popular attention and emotion than
any other effort to inject the White House in labor-management
relations--for example, a steel or rail strike.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has been tracking the baseball situation from a
distance, one Bush aide said several weeks ago. But he made it clear
at the time that the White House was uncertain just what role Bush
would play, if any, if the players strike.</TE>
<TE>   But by commenting on the strike deadline, Bush took a cautious
step into the fray.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very important for these people to get together," the
president said of the players and the owners. He added that whatever
reason they come up with to not reach agreement, "it is bad for them
not to reach an accord. They need to keep working."</TE>

<HD>FAA Is Told to Keep It Quiet Over Grand Canyon</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Appeals court says agency must use stricter rules
in deciding limits on air traffic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An appeals court Friday directed the Federal Aviation Administration
to, in effect, limit the number of helicopters and small airplanes
that can fly sightseers over the Grand Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered the
FAA to use a stricter definition of "natural quiet" when deciding how
much air traffic to allow over the canyon.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists predicted that the ruling would limit the
overflights that they say interfere with visitors trying to
appreciate the grandeur and wildness of the park from the ground or
the Colorado River.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling also signaled a new attitude on the part of the federal
courts.</TE>
<TE>   "The courts are strongly affirming that quiet is a natural
resource of the parks, and it should be protected just like water and
wildlife," said Geoff Barnard, president of the Grand Canyon Trust,
one of the environmental groups involved in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Congress told the FAA and the National Park Service in 1987 to
"substantially restore natural quiet" at the canyon, where noise from
numerous helicopters and small planes had become all too common.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a couple of rounds of regulations from the FAA since then,
the number of annual flights over the canyon has grown from 40,000 to
130,000. Although flights have been restricted from some areas of the
park, there are more flights than ever in other areas. The FAA
recently capped the number of flights at the current level and
established a curfew from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   In a lawsuit, several environmental groups challenged two aspects
of the FAA's current rules: averaging noise from flights over a full
year, and then establishing an "average day." That approach allowed a
lot of noise in the summer high season, so long as it was offset by
relative quiet in the winter. On the busiest summer days, only 19% of
the park would be "substantially" quiet.</TE>
<TE>   The court found the concept of an average annual day inconsistent
with the goal of the law.</TE>
<TE>   "People do not visit the park on 'average' days, nor do they stay
long enough to benefit from averaging noise over an entire year," the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled.
"For the typical visitor, who visits the Grand Canyon for just a few
days during the peak summer season, the fact that the park is quiet
'on average' is cold comfort."</TE>
<TE>   The court also agreed with the environmental groups that the FAA
should factor in noise from commercial air traffic when regulating
overflights. At the same time, the court rejected petitions by the
United States Air Tour Assn. to weaken the regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Although it was not yet clear what direction the FAA would take,
the obvious choices include further restricting the number of
flights, increasing the no-fly zones and requiring quieter planes.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and flight operators predicted a big change in
the air over the Grand Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "This will have a huge impact," Barnard said. "But it is not going
to eliminate overflights. It is going to balance overflights with
providing a good experience for everyone who is visiting."</TE>
<TE>   William Perry Pendley, the attorney who represented the operators,
said his clients believed the ruling so restricts them that they
would not be able to keep their businesses aloft.</TE>
<TE>   "What clients are telling us is that they're going to be driven
out of business," Pendley said. "They're not going to be able to
provide this opportunity for about a million people a year, mostly
elderly and physically challenged, to see the Grand Canyon."</TE>
<TE>   The decision came on the heels of a recent ruling by the same
court requiring the FAA to consider the effect of commercial flight
noise on visitors' experiences in Zion National Park when approving a
new airport in St. George, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "These are two serious victories for natural quiet," Barnard said.
"We live in a very noisy society. Parks are places where people go to
listen for silence."</TE>

<HD>Nantucketers Grumbling Over Traffic Rumblings</HD>
<DH>Congestion: Cars keep clogging the island each summer, but
only one thing may be turned away--a traffic signal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NANTUCKET, Mass.</DL>
<LD>When T. Michael Burns signed on last year as this quaint island's
transportation planner, "I was told there's three things you can't
touch: The cobblestones, the monuments in the street--and you're not
going to put a stoplight on Nantucket."</LD>
<LD>   Too many cars are clogging this whippet of land in the Atlantic
Ocean--14 miles long and just 3 1/2 miles across at its widest
point--putting Burns and a contentious committee of islanders at odds
as they struggle to solve the traffic dilemma while preserving
Nantucket's image as an oasis of laid-back charm.</LD>
<LD>   The issue is not just the number of vehicles but also their size
and their owners' city driving habits. Last week, Burns thought he
would try a little experiment by installing speed bumps on York
Street.</LD>
<TE>   "Speed bumps!" exclaimed Linda Williams, the island's acting
zoning commissioner. "I've got a problem with that. It's just not
Nantucket."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, neither is gridlock--in theory. But every summer day,
when the ferry docks at South Street, sport-utility vehicles from New
Jersey jostle SUVs from Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode
Island. In some cases, Mom, in a spiffy headband with matching shoes
and handbag, drives one vehicle; Dad, in golf gear, pilots another;
and teens Muffy and Biff might follow in a third.</TE>
<TE>   When wealthy vacationers descend on Nantucket, where oceanfront
rentals can go for $25,000 per week, the summer population
quintuples, to around 50,000. The number of cars soars to about half
that. Then there are the bicycles, motor scooters and delivery trucks
that arrive by ferry from the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, tourism is down about 5% over last year, but the car
total is up by about that.</TE>
<TE>   "It has gotten out of hand," said Nantucket Selectman Matt Fee,
who owns a bakery and sandwich shop. "There are too many vehicles and
not enough roads."</TE>
<TE>   Here, Fee said, "we're selling beaches, we're selling peace and
quiet. We're selling a beautiful summer resort at a slower pace than
they have at home. We're not selling traffic jams and cars parked on
sidewalks."</TE>
<TE>   Simple excursions that once took five minutes now last half an
hour. Main Street, renowned for its cobblestones, often resembles a
parking lot. The glut of vehicles on narrow roads laid out several
centuries ago is made worse by the mammoth proportions of the
abundant Lincoln Navigators, Chevrolet Suburbans and Cadillac
Escalades.</TE>
<TE>   "The traffic this year was terrible. On Main Street, sometimes it
was bumper to bumper," said Cathy Day, a Boston-area real estate
agent who recently vacationed here with her family. "I know people
who own houses on the island and leave a car there. Then when they
come over, they bring another one."</TE>
<TE>   Moira Sullivan, a recent transplant from the California wine
country, said the car density on Nantucket was so daunting that "it's
starting to remind me of St. Helena in the summer."</TE>
<TE>   And islanders also complain that, along with their cars, visitors
import their urban driving proclivities. With frozen cappuccino in
one hand, cell phone in the other, visitors window shop on Main
Street while navigating the cobblestones, islanders lament. Multiple
family members make multiple trips in multiple cars, the year-round
residents decry. And too many people just drive too fast.</TE>
<TE>   "If they drove that way at home," said Williams, the zoning
administrator, "they'd be a grease spot."</TE>
<TE>   For more than two years, a committee has debated possible
solutions. A Bermuda-inspired bill to impose a vehicle-permitting
system hit a brick wall with state legislators, who argued that
Nantucket is a county, not a country, and therefore must follow the
open registration rules of the rest of the commonwealth.</TE>
<TE>   A cute, town-owned shuttle bus circles the island, and guest
houses have begun sending out notices advising prospective visitors
to leave their cars at home.</TE>
<TE>   There is talk of building new roads, or paving some rustic dirt
pathways. A plan for a new traffic rotary was quashed because it
would have meant sacrificing a 300-year-old tree.</TE>
<TE>   After months of study, a Boston consulting firm found that five of
10 intersections performed at a "failed level of service," meaning
that vehicles waited more than 50 seconds to pass through, said
Christine Silverstein, head of Nantucket Sustainable Development
Corp., an island nonprofit.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the Nantucket mystique, visitors already are putting up
with $20 hamburgers and gasoline that costs $2.25 a gallon. The
Chamber of Commerce has never fully calculated just how generously
the summer influx enriches the island's coffers. But at last count,
it was estimated at $300 million to $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   But sooner or later, Silverstein and others contend, the
congestion will catch up with Nantucket, degrading the experience of
an island that markets itself as an antidote to the madness of the
mainland.</TE>
<TE>   "Our economy is character-based," she said. "It's not just the
beaches, it's the feel of everything else. I think visitors are not
going to come because they are stuck in traffic wherever they go on
the island."</TE>
<TE>   To combat that eventuality, the island's weekly newspaper
editorialized this year in favor of a stoplight--a solution that many
islanders consider the ultimate threat to Nantucket's quirky
personality. Resistance to the idea is high.</TE>
<TE>   A stoplight "is seen as this tremendous evil," Williams said. The
hurdle "over which no one wants to leap," echoed Silverstein.</TE>
<TE>   So when he is not sneaking out to secretly install speed bumps,
traffic planner Burns has come up with a stock response when asked
about the island's car problem: "I tell people we're working on it."</TE>
<TE>   Then Burns--who left Tempe, Ariz., to work on Nantucket--makes the
five-minute walk between his home and his office.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure we have some traffic here," he said. "But compared to
Arizona, this is paradise."</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Union to Protest Bush's Block on Funding</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The head of the biggest U.S. firefighters union declared Friday that
he will not use a memorial service for fallen comrades to protest
President Bush's rejection of funding for fire departments.</LD>
<LD>   But International Assn. of Fire Fighters President Harold
Schaitberger said he is planning to use his union's 255,000 members
to protest Bush at other events following his rejection of a
$5.1-billion appropriation bill that included $340 million for fire
departments.</LD>
<LD>   "I will have people every place the president goes," Schaitberger
said in an interview from Las Vegas, where the IAFF just concluded a
weeklong convention.</LD>
<TE>   But Schaitberger said one of the places the president is expected
to go where the IAFF will not mount a protest is the Oct. 6 annual
tribute to firefighters who died in action in the last year,
including those killed on Sept. 11, hosted by the National Fallen
Fire Fighters Foundation.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Many Roman Catholic priests in the United States say there's a
homosexual subculture in their dioceses, religious orders or
seminaries, according to a survey released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In the mail survey of 1,279 priests conducted by researchers at
the Catholic University of America, 19% of respondents said there was
"clearly" a gay subculture in their dioceses or religious orders, and
36% said there "probably" was. Asked the same question about the
seminaries they attended, 15% said "clearly" and 26% responded
"probably."</LD>
<LD>   The survey was reported by Jacqueline Wenger of the Catholic
University at a Chicago convention of the Assn. for the Sociology of
Religion, a group of Catholic sociologists. Wenger and colleague Dean
R. Hoge conducted the study for the National Federation of Priests'
Councils.</LD>
<TE>   The extent of homosexuality in the priesthood has become a matter
of increased debate this year after scandals of clerical sex abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the abuse victims have been young males, leading some
high-ranking Catholics to conclude that actively gay priests are an
important aspect of the church's problem. However, experts note that
there's no evidence that homosexuals are more likely than
heterosexuals to molest children.</TE>
<TE>   The questionnaire did not ask the priests whether they were gay.</TE>
<TE>   Hoge and Wenger wrote that, in talks with 75 priests, "we heard
numerous negative reports about homosexual subcultures in
seminaries." One priest said he was "shocked"; another called some
fellow students "kind of predators."</TE>
<TE>   The survey also asked about celibacy; 56% said marriage should be
a matter of personal choice for diocesan priests and 52% said the
church should welcome back priests who have resigned, whether married
or single. Only 12% said they'd likely marry if allowed.</TE>
<TE>   The Secretariat for Priestly Life and Ministry at the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops said it had not seen the report.</TE>

<HD>Search Expands for Missing Va. Girl</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officials initially thought Jennifer Short may have
run away when her parents were slain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BASSETT, Va.</DL>
<LD>Authorities launched a nationwide search Friday for 9-year-old
Jennifer Short, who vanished from the western Virginia home where her
parents were shot to death.</LD>
<LD>   "With every hour that goes by, I'm afraid the situation will get
ever more drastic," said Kimmy Nester, a Henry County sheriff's
captain. He pleaded: "If you are a captor, please release her."</LD>
<LD>   The bodies of Michael Short, 50, and Mary Short, 36, were found
Thursday after a co-worker stopped by their home 35 miles south of
Roanoke.</LD>
<TE>   The body of Michael Short, a self-employed mobile home mover, was
found on a couch in an enclosed carport; his wife's body was found in
a bedroom. Both had been shot in the head, and police said it didn't
appear to be a murder-suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer, a brown-haired fourth-grader, was nowhere to be found.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities initially thought the girl might have run away during
the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   But when she didn't turn up, they issued an Amber Alert, relaying
information about the case to television and radio stations in the
hope of finding her.</TE>
<TE>   Police searched the rolling hills behind the family's house and
were joined Friday by helicopters, search dogs and four-wheel-drive
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, authorities said they had exhausted their
search of the immediate area around the Shorts' home.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Cliff Roop said the co-worker who found Michael Short's body,
Christopher Thompson, was questioned as authorities tried to learn
whether Short had worked with any "disgruntled people."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they were going through records of people who had
recently been in the red brick home surrounded by motels and gas
stations on U.S. 220.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer was shy and polite and stuck close to her parents when
she wasn't in school or playing softball, said Valerie Spradlin, who
has known the family for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Her daddy was always trying to go out and be there at her games,
even though he was working so hard," Spradlin said. "They were just
plain, ordinary people. I don't know why anyone would want to kill
them."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ordered to Explain Talib's Detention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORFOLK, Va.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge said Friday that the government must give him more
than the "sparse facts" it has provided so far to explain why it is
holding an American-born man captured in Afghanistan late last year.</LD>
<LD>   "This case appears to be the first in American jurisprudence where
an American citizen has been held incommunicado and subjected to an
indefinite detention in the continental United States without
charges, without any finding by a military tribunal, and without
access to a lawyer," wrote U.S. District Judge Robert Doumar.</LD>
<LD>   The judge rejected the government's bid to avoid submitting more
evidence on Yaser Esam Hamdi, who was born in Louisiana and moved to
Saudi Arabia with his Saudi parents.</LD>
<TE>   Hamdi, 21, has been held in the Norfolk Naval Station brig since
April 5. The government says Hamdi is an enemy combatant and can be
held indefinitely without charges or a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Among the evidence Doumar said he wanted, solely for his review,
were statements made by Hamdi and the troops who captured him, and
the screening criteria used to determine Hamdi's status.</TE>
<TE>   The government has refused to comply with previous requests,
citing national security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock said Hamdi
traveled to Afghanistan for the purpose of fighting with the Taliban
and was carrying an AK-47 rifle when he was captured with an enemy
Taliban unit.</TE>
<TE>   "The Supreme Court has unanimously held that it is lawful to
detain enemy combatants in a time of war, even those who claim U.S.
citizenship," Comstock said. "It is important to remember that the
purpose of military detention is to prevent the enemy combatant from
continuing to aid those who would seek to injure our people, as well
as to gather intelligence to thwart further terrorist assaults."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Mobbs, special advisor to the undersecretary of Defense
for policy, wrote in an affidavit that Hamdi told U.S. military
interrogators he went to Afghanistan last summer to train with and
fight for the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Doumar wasn't convinced, saying that he would be acting as "little
more than a rubber stamp" by accepting Mobbs' statement as sufficient
justification.</TE>
<TE>   Public defender Frank Dunham Jr., who has been trying to meet with
Hamdi, has argued that Hamdi is being denied his constitutional right
to due process and should be freed.</TE>

<HD>Florida Appointee Assailed for Link to Parenting Essay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Gov. Jeb Bush drew sharp criticism Friday after his choice to head
Florida's child welfare agency was linked to an essay that says
spanking hard enough to cause welts is OK and that married women
shouldn't have careers.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats hoping to oust the Republican governor quickly turned
the appointment of Jerry Regier as Department of Children &amp; Families
secretary into a political issue.</LD>
<LD>   They cited the 1989 essay, "The Christian World View of the
Family," which says Christians shouldn't marry non-Christians,
couples should be allowed to divorce only in cases of adultery or
abandonment, and premarital sex and masturbation should not be
"accepted as 'normal' or legal."</LD>
<TE>   Bob Poe, chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, said the
governor either didn't do his homework on Regier "or he agrees with
the extreme positions his appointee has taken regarding women and
families."</TE>
<TE>   Regier tried to disassociate himself with the paper, which lists
him on the cover page as co-chairman of the group that wrote it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not a co-author of this paper and did not exercise
editorial control over its content," Regier said in a statement
released by the governor's office. "Rather, as a family advocate, I
was asked to serve as a co-chairman of the group that released the
paper."</TE>
<TE>   He said he broke his relationship with the Coalition on Revival
Inc. a year after the paper was published because of the group's
extreme interpretations of the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not my position that corporal punishment should result in
welts or bruises," Regier wrote. "My own wife of 34 years is a
registered nurse, and I am extremely supportive of her career. I
support women in the work force as well as women holding an equal
role in marriage."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who is seeking a second term this fall, defended his choice
and said Regier's background was thoroughly checked. He said he did
not know about the essay before he appointed Regier but accepted that
Regier disassociated himself from it.</TE>

<HD>Volume of Trial Evidence Delays Moussaoui Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Friday delayed until Jan. 6 the trial of Zacarias
Moussaoui, the only person charged in the Sept. 11 attacks on the
United States, to give Moussaoui more time to review the huge amount
of evidence.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that the volume and
complexity of the evidence warranted a delay in the trial, which had
been scheduled to begin with jury selection Sept. 30 and then with
opening arguments Oct. 14.</LD>
<LD>   "Although the public's right to speedy trial is a legitimate
concern, this court's paramount concern is ensuring that the
defendant receive a fair trial," Brinkema wrote in a three-page
ruling.</LD>
<TE>   "The volume and complexity of the evidence in this prosecution
fully support the defense request for a brief continuance of the
trial date," she added, saying her decision was based on the "fair
administration of justice."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came in response to separate requests by Moussaoui--who
is not an attorney but is representing himself--and his
court-appointed, standby lawyers who said Moussaoui needs more time
to review the huge amount of information and conduct a thorough
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had opposed the delay, arguing that the public
interest in a speedy resolution of the case took precedence over
Moussaoui's lack of preparedness.</TE>

<HD>After 'Difficult' Year, INS Chief Quitting Job</HD>
<DH>Immigration: James Ziglar took post shortly before Sept.
11. Since then, his agency's actions have angered lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>James Ziglar, the embattled chief of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said Friday that he would leave his job by
the end of the year, ending a short tenure at what is widely
considered one of the government's worst run agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The INS has long been seen as inadequate in its job as enforcer of
the nation's immigration laws. Ziglar, a financial services lawyer
and boyhood friend of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.),
had no background in immigration law when he began the job last
August.  But he was expected to repair relations between the agency
and lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the agency has angered many lawmakers since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, which gave border and immigration control a more
urgent national security role. In one high-profile failure that
angered even President Bush, an INS contractor sent out visa
approvals for two of the Sept. 11 hijackers--six months after the
attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a nice guy ... but he is completely and totally incapable of
running an agency of this magnitude," Rep. Thomas G. Tancredo
(R-Colo.) said of Ziglar.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have fired him a long time ago. We're absolutely
better off from this. I'd have been willing to kick in for a golden
parachute if he would have left earlier," Tancredo said, referring to
the buyout plans sometimes given to corporate executives.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said Ziglar had served the administration
"admirably during a very important time under extraordinarily
difficult circumstances. We appreciate his commitment and service to
the country." The INS is part of the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar wrote to Bush on Thursday that he had set no date for his
departure.</TE>
<TE>   He offered to stay on until Congress and the president approve
legislation creating a Department of Homeland Security, which is
expected to include some or all of the INS' 34,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar told Bush that, although he could not have imagined the
"dramatic changes" that the Sept. 11 attacks thrust on the INS, "I
have done my best to continue making progress toward the goals of
restructuring the agency and reducing backlogs while responding to
the call to arms in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that the record will indicate that we have made
substantial progress toward these goals."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have said the agency is plagued by low morale, high
attrition and an inability to perform basic functions. As an example,
said Tancredo, who favors tougher enforcement of immigration laws,
the INS has been unable to find more than 300,000 people who have
been ordered by immigration law judges to be deported for committing
serious crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has also been torn by two competing missions: to help
foreigners navigate the admission and naturalization processes, and
to police borders and remove illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar, a self-described libertarian, favored the agency's
welcoming roles more than its policing roles, a stance that became
untenable after Sept. 11, several observers of the INS said.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect it was becoming increasingly difficult for a
pro-immigration Republican to feel that he has a place at the table
within this administration, which is increasingly perceived by
immigrants as hostile to hard-working, law-abiding newcomers," said
Angela Kelley, deputy director of the National Immigration Forum,
which advocates policies that welcome immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar's reported discomfort with his law enforcement role "would
have been problematic in ordinary times. But with the INS as one of
the lead agencies in homeland security, it became deeply
problematic," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center
for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter immigration laws.</TE>
<TE>   Krikorian and Kelley said Ziglar was quick after Sept. 11 to say
repeatedly that immigrants should not be equated with terrorists. But
where Kelley said those comments set the proper tone, Krikorian said
they showed that Ziglar did not grasp "that the terrorist assault on
the U.S. has to be met in part through immigration policies."</TE>
<TE>   Hints that Ziglar was out of step with the administration, said
Kelley, included the fact that Ashcroft, and not Ziglar, had made
several recent announcements of tougher immigration policies.</TE>
<TE>   They included a July announcement that the INS would pursue fines,
jail or deportation against immigrants and foreign visitors who
failed to notify the government within 10 days of a change of
address. The department has also said it will require that tens of
thousands of foreign visitors be fingerprinted and photographed.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the House voted, with White House approval, to break the
INS into separate agencies for border enforcement and new
citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Bush administration has proposed creating the
massive homeland security agency. The House, Senate and White House
disagree on which INS functions should be folded into the new agency
and how they should be organized within that agency.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar, a Mississippi native, is a lawyer with experience in the
investment banking industry, including two stints as a managing
director at PaineWebber Inc. He also held a senior job at the
Interior Department, as well as several other government jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he became sergeant at arms of the Senate, serving as

<HD>Presbyterians Pick Lutheran Pastor</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brentwood Presbyterian Church has taken the unusual step of naming a
Lutheran minister, the Rev. Stephen Lien, as its new pastor.</LD>
<LD>   Lien, 49, a minister in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, will be formally installed Oct. 6. Officials said he is the
first Lutheran pastor to be called to a Presbyterian congregation in
the Synod of Southern California and Hawaii, which comprises 350
churches.</LD>
<LD>   In 1998, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) approved a reciprocity
agreement with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Under it,
a congregation in either denomination could call a minister ordained
by the other.</LD>
<TE>   Lien, who succeeds the late Rev. Charles Shields in the
1,344-member Brentwood congregation, said he believed
denominationalism will become less important in the years ahead. "The
20th century allowed us the luxury of raising our families in the
same church, often from birth to death," he said. "Now, more
typically, people are entering church in their 20s or 30s, when they
are having their first child, getting married or divorced, or going
through some turmoil in their life, with literally no connection to
the church. We have to focus on the fundamentals, the essence of our
Christianity, the many things we hold in common."</TE>
<TE>   Lien was born in Windom, Minn., grew up in New York City, and
graduated from Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minn., in 1980. He earned
his doctorate there in 1998. For the last 12 years he served as
senior pastor at St. John Lutheran Church in Cedar Falls, Iowa. He
and his wife, Joanne, have three grown children.</TE>

<HD>Spacecraft Might Have Broken Up</HD>
<DH>NASA: A telescope detects two separate objects that could
be parts of missing Contour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A NASA spacecraft on a four-year mission to probe the heart of two
comets has apparently broken into two pieces, according to
astronomers who believe they captured an image of the wounded
spacecraft.</LD>
<LD>   The $159-million Contour spacecraft had been incommunicado since
early Thursday when its solid-propellant rocket motor was scheduled
to fire and boost the space probe out of Earth's orbit.</LD>
<LD>   The mission team had been working since then, hoping to
reestablish contact with the craft--until they saw the photo.</LD>
<TE>   "You see two pieces floating around like that and it's not
encouraging," mission director Robert Farquhar said in a news
conference from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, the
organization that built the spacecraft for NASA.</TE>
<TE>   The picture shows the region where the spacecraft was estimated to
be, an area 250,000 miles from Earth. Instead of showing one object,
the picture shows two distinct objects. They are about 155 miles away
from each other.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I thought, great, that's the spacecraft and the rocket
booster. But then I learned it wasn't supposed to separate," said Jim
Scotti, a planetary scientist in the University of Arizona's
Spacewatch program who used a telescope atop Kitt Peak to search for
the missing Contour.</TE>
<TE>   Farquhar said the most likely explanation for the images were that
the spacecraft had lost a significant piece or had broken apart. He
said it was possible that the second object, which is dimmer, may be
something like insulation.</TE>
<TE>   Making the observation was difficult because the spacecraft was
traveling in front of the middle of the Milky Way, where star density
is extremely thick, Scotti said.</TE>
<TE>   Working through the night to make the observation, Scotti did not
find the objects immediately. His colleague Jeff Larsen detected the
two objects Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Farquhar, though "a little discouraged," said his team is not yet
giving up and will spend the weekend trying to contact the spacecraft
and determine what might have caused a failure.</TE>
<TE>   The photograph indicates that the motor did indeed fire to take
the craft out of Earth orbit. Contour is speeding away from our
planet and not in any danger of falling back. It is too far away from
Earth for a shuttle mission to reach it for repairs, Farquhar said.</TE>
<TE>   It is still unclear, he said, what happened as the engine fired.
"We haven't found any smoking guns," he said. "Everything seemed to
be normal going into the burn and then we couldn't find it."</TE>
<TE>   The burn to push the spacecraft out of Earth orbit is a critical
part of the mission but is not considered especially risky, he said.
The motor aboard the craft is routinely used in Earth-orbiting
satellites and is considered reliable.</TE>
<TE>   The Contour craft was slated to chase two comets around the sun
and come within 70 miles of them to study the primitive material that
made up the solar system.</TE>

<HD>West Nile Virus Takes 2 More Lives</HD>
<DH>Health: The deaths of two men, in Illinois and Louisiana,
raise the U.S. toll to 11 this year. Wyoming reports its first case,
detected in a horse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One man in Louisiana and another in Illinois have died after being
infected with the West Nile virus, while Wyoming authorities said the
virus has been detected for the first time in that state, according
to state health officials.</LD>
<LD>   A 67-year-old Illinois man died six days after being admitted to a
hospital on Aug. 4, according to Illinois officials. And a
78-year-old Livingston Parish man became the eighth fatality of the
year in Louisiana.</LD>
<LD>   The two cases bring the U.S. death toll for the year to 11,
counting two other deaths in Mississippi.</LD>
<TE>   The detection of the virus in Wyoming brings the number of states
where the virus has been identified to 39. It has now been found in
every state east of the Rocky Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear to us that the virus will, in fact, go coast to coast;
it's just a matter of time," said Dr. Lyle Petersen of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Diseases spread by
insects or animals, known as vector-borne diseases, can be
transmitted widely at a very rapid rate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vicki Kramer, chief of the vector-borne disease section of the
California Department of Health Services, said: "We do think that it
will be introduced [into California], possibly this year, but more
likely in the next one to two years."</TE>
<TE>   She noted that the department had expanded its surveillance
program in 2001 "to enable us to detect it as soon as possible once
it is introduced."</TE>
<TE>   But she also said that California has a nationally respected
mosquito-control program that could minimize the effect of the virus
if it should reach here.</TE>
<TE>   The West Nile virus is carried over long distances by birds, which
eventually fall ill from the virus and die.</TE>
<TE>   While the infected birds are alive, however, they are bitten by
mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans.</TE>
<TE>   Most people who are infected with the virus have no symptoms.
About 1 in 5 develop mild flu-like signs. But a small fraction of
those infected, perhaps 1 in 100 to 150, develop viral meningitis or
encephalitis and become extremely ill, requiring hospitalization.
From 11% to 14% of those die of their illness.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who survive their hospitalization, Petersen said,
about half of them still have some neurological problems a year
later.</TE>
<TE>   From 1999--when the first U.S. case appeared in New York--to 2001,
149 Americans were hospitalized as a result of infections and 18
died, according to the CDC. By midweek, the CDC had identified 156
more cases this year, but four new cases were reported Thursday,
three in Chicago and one in New York. Human cases have now been
reported in 13 states, with Texas being the most affected with 16
cases.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent state affected is Michigan, where officials said
Friday that two elderly men had suspected cases of the virus. Both
men are expected to recover.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC's Petersen said Thursday that there could be as many as
1,000 severe cases this year, which would translate to about 100
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   But he also noted that mosquito control efforts in Louisiana and
elsewhere could "have a major effect on blunting this epidemic. So if
those efforts are highly successful, we may see a lot less than 1,000
cases."</TE>
<TE>   Officials noted that this is many fewer than the number of U.S.
deaths from influenza and other infectious diseases, but they fear
the number will rise as the virus becomes more firmly entrenched in
wildlife throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Petersen also said that a significantly larger proportion of the
cases detected in humans this year are among younger people, although
most deaths have been among the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   The Wyoming case occurred in a horse from eastern Goshen County
near the Nebraska border. Samples were collected the previous week
and tested at the state veterinary laboratory in Laramie.</TE>
<TE>   "We're treating it as a positive and we feel really comfortable
calling it a positive," said Ross Doman, a spokesman for the state
health department.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado health officials on Thursday reported the detection of
the virus in a crow and three horses, the first time it had been seen
in that state as well.</TE>
<TE>   California has a network of surveillance programs that collect
mosquitoes and analyze them for the presence of several viruses,
including West Nile. Sentinel chickens are also an important part of
the program. The mosquitoes that carry the viruses prefer to bite
birds rather than mammals, but the chickens are not harmed by
infection. Health authorities bleed the animals every two weeks (by
pricking their combs) and check for antibodies to several viruses.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer urged Californians who see crows, jays, ravens, magpies,
sparrows or finches that have been dead for less than 24 hours to
report them to health authorities at 1-877-WNV-BIRD.</TE>
<TE>   The department will pick them up and test for the presence of the
virus.</TE>

<LD>Before I moved to Los Angeles and had children, I never dreamed that
20 years after graduating from a public high school I would not even
be willing to discuss the possibility of sending my children to our
local public school. But things have changed, and so have I.</LD>
<LD>   No matter what my reasons, I'm tired of hearing everything that's
wrong with my decision. First, many people "accuse" private school
parents of being rich, as if this were a sin. As if the possibility
of becoming rich wasn't the reason immigrants pour into this country.</LD>
<LD>   For the record, I am not rich. As our tax return would show, my
husband and I grossed $69,000 in 2001. This is quite a bit more than
the migrant farm worker's family makes and quite a bit more than the
minimum-wage earner's family makes. But this is not rich.</LD>
<TE>   Yet we're fairly typical of families at my daughter's private
religious school. Since tuition payments are roughly the same as a
new car payment, we will forgo the new cars to send our children to
private school.</TE>
<TE>   Second, many express the desire to expose their children to the
diversity of public school. Implication: Private schools lack
diversity. If such people mean by diversity a wide range of colors
and ethnicities--and if simply sitting next to a little African
American boy and a little Korean American girl qualifies as exposing
our children to diversity--then our private school wins, hands down.</TE>
<TE>   Our house sits between two public elementary schools in different
neighborhoods: One is heavily Latino, and most of its students are
English language learners; the other is almost purely white and
middle class.</TE>
<TE>   In my daughter's class, her best friends are Latino and Korean. Of
the 30 students in her class, it appears that only eight are "white."
I haven't polled the parents as to their official color, but when I
pick my daughter up, the gathering of parents is a cornucopia of
accents, dress and ethnicities.</TE>
<TE>   How about religious diversity? I haven't belonged to a church
since leaving home at 18. So I am not concerned with the details of
Christianity as much as with the imparting of values. I want my
children to care about others, take responsibility for their actions
and their lives, and work hard. And I am not all that concerned that
they be exposed to those who do not share these values. But public
school children are not exposed to a variety of religions, either. In
fact, in the name of diversity, each religion is equally ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, religious institutions may be exempt from the Americans
With Disabilities Act. Yet my daughter, who has Type 1 diabetes and
requires insulin shots and multiple daily blood tests, was welcomed
in the private school world. The teachers and staff embraced her,
accommodating her schedule and maintenance requirements.</TE>
<TE>   So to those so offended by stereotypes, do me a favor: Please
discontinue stereotyping private schools. Those of us who send our
children to private schools are as diverse as any group. And we are
the same as other parents--we want what we believe is best for our
children.</TE>

<LD>Jacqueline Marris and Tamara Brooks are my new heroines. These two
brave Southern California teenagers not only acted to survive their
ordeal but also made an important decision to speak out on national
television after their kidnapping and rape Aug. 1.</LD>
<LD>   With the loving support of their families, they performed a great
service to rape survivors everywhere by refusing to be shamed into
silence.</LD>
<LD>   Their act of courage, of course, does not mean that the stigma
surrounding rape is fading.</LD>
<TE>   Media pundits revictimize these young women when they say that the
teenagers came forward merely to claim their "15 minutes of fame."
Brooks told reporters that they spoke because "We want to get the
message across to everybody to never give up on anything. Whatever
obstacles you have, you've got to fight your way through it."</TE>
<TE>   One of those obstacles is the societal stigma. My experiences, and
those of hundreds of other rape survivors I have met, is that the
stigma is alive and well.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department figures tell us that one in six women have
experienced an attempted or completed sexual assault. Maybe people
feel that if they can distance themselves from the victims of rape by
finding a reason to blame them, they and their loved ones won't be as
vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Some examples of victim blaming I have heard from family, friends,
neighbors, TV reporters, law officers, prosecutors and strangers
include:</TE>
<TE>   "What were you wearing?"</TE>
<TE>   "What were you doing out so late?"</TE>
<TE>   "Be grateful you weren't hurt."</TE>
<TE>   "If you had only taken kickboxing, this never would have happened
to you."</TE>
<TE>   "Why would your boyfriend want to stay with you?"</TE>
<TE>   Why go public, then, as more women are choosing to do? Their
motivations may include changing antiquated laws, preventing rapes by
the same perpetrator or helping others by putting a face to rape
statistics and sharing their experiences of recovery.</TE>
<TE>   We can identify with a mother who speaks out after a drunk driver
kills her child. Who would question why she would want to share her
private grief and anger?</TE>
<TE>   Rape survivors who choose to speak publicly rarely have the
support of their families, and too often don't have the support of
rape crisis centers, which are concerned about the confidentiality of
their critical counseling services.</TE>
<TE>   Jeri Elster, my friend and a fellow advocate of speaking out, was
devastated when she discovered that her rapist, who was identified by
DNA, could not be prosecuted because prosecutors ordered the testing
after the then-six-year statute of limitations lapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Jeri says telling her story in front of TV cameras during state
Assembly hearings was the best thing she ever did. Like a lot of
survivors, Jeri felt completely disempowered by the rapist. It was a
"much-needed emotional boost" to her when she helped change
California law to effectively eliminate the statute of limitations on
rape cases with DNA evidence.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 27, the 10th anniversary of Jeri's assault, she will lead
a march in downtown L.A. to protest the disposal of DNA evidence by
local law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Something unexpected happened after my own first interview on
national TV about my rape. Women I knew and complete strangers came
up to me and thanked me, whispering that they too had been raped.
Most of them had never told anyone, not even their mothers and
husbands.</TE>
<TE>   They are members of what I call the Secret Sorority, women
silently burdened by the long-term effects of the trauma of rape.
Rapists frequently threaten their victims: "Shut up!" and "If you
tell anyone, I will come back and kill you!" When we decide to go
public, we break their power over us.</TE>
<TE>   No one aspires to be a poster girl for rape. We come out in spite

<HD>A Small Thing for Justice</HD>
<DH>A fill-in judge assigned to take on a former Nicaraguan
president did just that. Now she's a hero in a country plagued by
corruption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANAGUA, Nicaragua</DL>
<LD>The judge stood in the hot sun before the wide gate, waiting for the
powerful man inside.</LD>
<LD>   She was a small woman, with a cheap green jacket and a worn
briefcase. Drops of sweat rolled down her face.</LD>
<LD>   She was there to interrogate the man on the other side of the
gate, the nation's former president, accused of corruption.</LD>
<TE>   But Nicaragua is a place where the rich and powerful have long
escaped justice, and simple district judges don't dare probe too
deeply into their lives.</TE>
<TE>   And so Gertrudis Arias waited, and she sweated, and she wondered
whether she would become yet another symbol of justice thwarted.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt completely impotent," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Gertrudis Arias became a hero.</TE>
<TE>   This is the improbable story of Arias--former maid, former
sweatshop worker and now substitute judge--and her quest to
investigate Arnoldo Aleman, the former president and current head of
the nation's Congress.</TE>
<TE>   It is also a larger story about corruption in Latin America, about
its continued, debilitating effect on the region's people and
politics. Corruption is a black shadow that afflicts nearly every
country in Central and South America, gnawing at people's faith in
government, hampering development and scaring away foreign
investment.</TE>
<TE>   The fight against corruption has become a pillar of U.S. policy in
the region, and legal tools developed after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks have resulted in aggressive new policies designed to clean up
crooked governments.</TE>
<TE>   The fight is difficult, fought in legislators' back rooms and
overcrowded judges' offices, by crusading journalists and concerned
citizens groups.</TE>
<TE>   But it is one that a growing number of people--both powerful and
ordinary--have come to see as crucial if Latin America is to escape
the misery that mars the daily lives of millions of its people.</TE>
<TE>   "Corruption is the problem that touches all of our other
problems," said Jaime Lopez, head of Probidad, an anti-corruption
group based in El Salvador. "It puts the brakes on development, slows
us down and stops us from arriving at the solution to our problems."</TE>
<TE>   Gertrudis Arias learned her values growing up poor.</TE>
<TE>   There were 11 children in the house, and none ever wore shoes.
Giving a pair to one child would have meant giving a pair to all--and
her parents couldn't afford that.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents "would say, 'You may see money lying on the ground,
but don't touch it,' " she said. "They taught me that it's OK to be
poor, as long as you're honest."</TE>
<TE>   She started work as a maid at 14, graduated from high school and
then went to work in a sweatshop.</TE>
<TE>   But toward the end of the Communist Sandinista era, she began
attending college and law school on Saturdays, thanks to a
scholarship. In 1993, she received her degree and a year later passed
the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Arias wanted to become a judge. To gain experience she took a job
working as a clerk for a lower court judge, eventually moving up to
felony-level court.</TE>
<TE>   Her strategy worked. In Nicaragua, where there is a shortage of
full-time judges, each court has a substitute judge, who fills in
when the regular judge is on vacation or at a seminar. Arias was
appointed as a substitute last year.</TE>
<TE>   The system of substitute judges has long been considered
particularly prone to corruption. Defense lawyers manipulate case
schedules so their clients conveniently appear before the substitute,
often a low-paid attorney, who dismisses the charge for a price.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after her boss left to attend to bureaucratic court
matters in March, Arias got a petition from prosecutors to subpoena
Aleman. Under Nicaragua's legal system, judges act much like district
attorneys in the U.S., taking statements from witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The Aleman case centered on a shady transaction involving the
state television station in the waning days of Aleman's
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Allegedly acting under orders from Aleman, station officials
bought $1.3 million in new transmission equipment from Mexico's TV
Azteca. The money never reached TV Azteca, instead winding up with a
company run by two Aleman advisors.</TE>
<TE>   The subpoena had an expiration date. Arias had only 10 days to
interrogate one of the most powerful men in Nicaragua.</TE>
<TE>   Arias takes the bus to work and makes $300 a month. She is
married, the mother of two grown children. Hers is a simple life,
filled mostly with work. She declined to be interviewed at her home
in a modest neighborhood of Managua until she had a chance to clean
up.</TE>
<TE>   But her broad, flat face betrayed no hesitation when she was asked
if she was daunted by the task in front of her. She laughed and waved
her hand, as if it were silly to suggest such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   "He was called as a witness. The law establishes that the judge
must interview him," Arias said. "I had to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Stories accusing Aleman of corruption dominate the headlines in
Managua, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   When he started in politics as mayor of Managua in 1990, Aleman
listed his net worth as about $26,000. When he left the presidency
early this year, he filed a disclosure form putting his worth at $1.4
million.</TE>
<TE>   During his term, he was accused of using state money to build a
helicopter pad at his ranch. He is being investigated for allegedly
using a state credit card to buy more than $1.7 million in jewelry,
clothing and hotel stays. His opponents call him "Gordoman"--not only
for his 300-pound bulk, but for the sheer rapacity of the alleged
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Aleman has never been found guilty of any of the accusations
against him. With every allegation, he has either refused to comment
or blamed underlings for any misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   He did not respond to requests for interviews for this article,
but an ally blamed the charges on a "political fight" between Aleman
and current President Enrique Bolanos, who was Aleman's vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say they don't accept the explanations but are
waiting for hard evidence before acting against Aleman.</TE>
<TE>   Under recently appointed Assistant Secretary of State Otto J.
Reich, the U.S. has been aggressively yanking the visas of those
considered corrupt. The idea behind the policy is that corruption is
a chief threat to democracy and free markets in Latin America, where
a series of populist, leftist movements has arisen in response to the
persistent poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you say that [Aleman has] been guilty of all kinds of sins?
The circumstantial evidence would suggest yes," said a State
Department official. "This was a country where everything happened
because Aleman said so. It's not a place he can say: 'It's a bunch of
bad apples. I didn't know.' "</TE>
<TE>   But for now, it seems, Aleman has ironclad protection. All
legislators in Nicaragua, as in most of Latin America, have immunity
against prosecution. And Aleman, as part of a deal worked out with
opposition Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega, automatically became a
congressman when he left office. Presidents are barred by law from
running for a second term.</TE>
<TE>   That immunity, however, didn't prevent him from being called as a
witness in the TV station case. Soon after news surfaced that the
prosecutor had issued a subpoena, Arias says, a man approached her in
the crowded office where she works and pulled her aside.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand you want to be a Supreme Court magistrate. It's good
to remember that Aleman still controls the assembly," she said the
man told her.</TE>
<TE>   Arias ignored him. She called Aleman's office and set up an
appointment. Then, on March 15, five days before the scheduled
interview, she learned from reporters that Aleman had invited various
political figures to a going-away party. He was bound for a vacation
in Greece the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew by then what he was doing. He had bad intentions," Arias
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tailed by a gaggle of reporters who were following the case and by
two prosecutors, Arias immediately set out to find Aleman. First, she
stopped at his office, but he had left for the day. So she decided to
drive to El Chile, his hacienda-style ranch about 15 miles outside
the capital. There, two guards blocked her entry. One told her the
former president wasn't there.</TE>
<TE>   She waited.</TE>
<TE>   The reporters accompanying her made some phone calls. One told
Arias that a source said Aleman was definitely inside. Arias told the
guards and insisted that Aleman see her.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after an hour had passed and Arias was drenched in sweat,
one of Aleman's emissaries invited her and the two prosecutors
inside.</TE>
<TE>   Once there, she glimpsed a party going on in a distant room. She
noticed two Supreme Court magistrates and several congressmen.</TE>
<TE>   Then Aleman came into the room. He had a typed statement in his
hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is the document," he said. "I wasn't going to leave the
country without giving it to you."</TE>
<TE>   But Arias, citing the law, insisted that Aleman give an oral
statement and answer questions. Surrounded by six advisors, Aleman
had to agree.</TE>
<TE>   He read his statement, then answered questions for four hours, the
first time in recent Nicaraguan history that a former president had
testified before a judge in a corruption case.</TE>
<TE>   He denied all knowledge of the transaction. His appointees at the
television station acted without his consent, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then he left the room.</TE>
<TE>   But Arias had gotten what she came for.</TE>
<TE>   "In spite of his plans to avoid it, we got the declaration. It was
worth it," she said with a small smile.</TE>
<TE>   Six days later, she ordered the arrest of all those originally
accused, including Aleman's former advisors and three former
government officials.</TE>
<TE>   And she asked the assembly to strip Aleman of his immunity, so he
could stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   The assembly, controlled by Aleman, has so far not acted on the
request.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing number of government officials, intellectuals and
ordinary people are calling for the legislature to take away Aleman's
immunity.</TE>
<TE>   In early August, Bolanos presented on television an exhaustive set
of documents that he said proved Aleman had stolen nearly $95 million
from the state.</TE>
<TE>   He joined those asking for an end to Aleman's immunity and pledged
to lead a public protest.</TE>
<TE>   "Arnoldo, I never imagined that you would betray the people,"
Bolanos said during the presentation. "You took pensions from
retirees, medicine from the sick, salaries from teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "You robbed the trust of our people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aleman angrily lashed back the next day, denying the charges and
accusing Bolanos of a political attack.</TE>
<TE>   At last count, he continued to hold a majority in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Arias has returned to her work as a clerk. Her office is about the
size of a Winnebago, and she shares it with five other people.</TE>
<TE>   Accused criminals in handcuffs come and go. Typewriters clack
away--no one has a computer. There is a constant murmur.</TE>
<TE>   She eats at a small restaurant down the street, where the lunch
special--a ham sandwich, a drink and a bag of chips--costs $1.50.
Everywhere she walks, people call out her name. Poets have written
her praises in newspapers. Local human rights groups have held
parties in her honor. To many, she is a hero, walking proof that
sometimes the little guys win.</TE>
<TE>   But Arias worries about her future. Aleman defenders have accused
her of being a Sandinista and a former state security member, which
she denies.</TE>
<TE>   She still hopes to be a Supreme Court magistrate one day. But for
now, she is happy to have done some small thing for justice.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad if I've done society some good," she said. "But if I
did, I didn't mean it. For me, I was just doing my job."</TE>

<HD>Domestic Feuds Derail Bush-Fox Diplomacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President Vicente Fox
journeyed to Washington and challenged President Bush to quickly
adopt Mexico's ambitious proposals to legalize 3.5 million
undocumented Mexicans in the United States and expand guest worker
programs.</LD>
<LD>   The two men touted their friendship with easy bilingual banter.
Mexico, Bush said, is "our most important ally." A dramatic
improvement in ties between often quarreling neighbors looked
imminent, the fruit of a courtship between like-minded
rancher-statesmen.</LD>
<LD>   But their personal chemistry raised expectations here that have
since been dashed--and not just by the terrorist attacks that shifted
Bush's focus away from Mexico. Fox's American agenda is also stalled
by domestic politics in both countries that have limited each
president's power to act and forced the Mexican leader to turn his
attention homeward.</LD>
<TE>   Fox's surprise decision to cancel an Aug. 28 visit with his
American counterpart at the Bush ranch in Texas--to protest that
state's execution Wednesday of a Mexican citizen convicted of
murder--is the most recent example of how conflicting domestic
priorities have pushed the two leaders apart.</TE>
<TE>   Fox and Bush took office within weeks of each other, in December
2000 and January 2001, respectively. Over time, both have become
hamstrung on key bilateral goals by their respective congresses.</TE>
<TE>   Republican lawmakers in Washington, for example, oppose a bill
that would give Fox part of what he wants by allowing undocumented
immigrants to stay in the United States while applying for permanent
residency. There has been no significant progress in bilateral talks
over Fox's broad proposals for immigration reform.</TE>
<TE>   Texas politicians during the spring obliged Bush to elevate a
bitter dispute over scarce water in the Rio Grande basin--and
Mexico's multibillion-gallon debt to the state's parched farmers--to
the top of the U.S.-Mexico agenda. That dispute forced Fox to cancel
an earlier visit to Texas, in June.</TE>
<TE>   And the U.S. Supreme Court has irritated Mexico by ruling that
employers who violate American labor law in their treatment of
illegal immigrant workers cannot be required to pay back wages.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, whose election two summers ago ended seven decades of
one-party rule, is under criticism at home over his failure to create
jobs and push through promised tax and energy reforms. Mexicans are
divided almost evenly over whether closer ties to the United States
will help pull their country out of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition parties that dominate the Mexican Congress have accused
Fox of investing too much time on better ties with the United States
and have blocked his domestic reforms. The Mexican Senate registered
its discontent with Washington's flagging interest by preventing
Fox's scheduled visit in April to the U.S. and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, when the U.S.-Mexico relationship was being handled
president to president, the future looked better for some kind of
immigration accord," said Denise Dresser, a Mexican political
scientist. "But now that political parties and other interests have
jumped into the fray, it has become harder to negotiate."</TE>
<TE>   With midterm elections approaching in both countries, she added,
"the window of opportunity may have closed."</TE>
<TE>   By snubbing Bush this week, Fox sacrificed a chance to reassert
his proposals on immigration and to tackle contentious bilateral
issues of water and trade. He would have been the only foreign leader
granted an audience this month at the ranch near Crawford--a setting
conducive to quality time.</TE>
<TE>   But Fox calculated that he was unlikely to come back with any
concessions, analysts in Mexico said, and staged his unusually
vigorous protest against the execution in order to bolster his shaky
standing at home.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic politics on both sides of the border conspired to create
an intractable conflict over the fate of Javier Suarez Medina, the
33-year-old convicted of killing a Dallas police officer in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   In a slow summer news cycle, the countdown to Suarez's death
dominated headlines in Mexico. As it had done in similar cases, the
Foreign Ministry protested the sentence, saying Suarez had been
denied the legal aid guaranteed for foreigners under an international
treaty.</TE>
<TE>   But following the frenzied news coverage here--highlighting the
prevailing view here that U.S. justice is often unfair to
Latinos--Fox made telephone appeals to Bush and Texas Gov. Rick
Perry.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, running for reelection this fall, could ill afford
to spare the life of a cop killer.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, too, was facing a sensitive date on the political calendar:
the president's annual Sept. 1 state of the nation speech before
Congress. In the more democratic Mexico that brought him to power, he
risked disruptive jeers from opposition lawmakers if he had been
wined and dined in Texas on the heels of Suarez's lethal injection.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's decision to stay home won applause across Mexico's political
spectrum. Lorena Beauregard, a congresswoman from the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which lost power in the 2000 elections, said Fox
"finally understands that he must stand up against the United States
for the interests of the country."</TE>
<TE>   "He showed sensitivity to the feeling among Mexicans that we need
more dignity in our relations with the United States," said Sen.
Raymundo Cardenas of the opposition Democratic Revolution Party.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts here compared Fox's move to a negotiator who walks
away from the table, gambling that the other side will sweeten its
offer to get him back. Asked about Fox's decision, Bush told
reporters Friday he was "confident that our friendship is strong,
that we'll be able to work together to resolve common problems."</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration has a huge investment in Fox, because it
thinks he's going to produce the kind of Mexico that, strategically,
it is much more comfortable with," said Daniel Lund, president of
Mund Americas, a Mexico City company that surveys public opinion.
"What happened this week may give the Bush people a real sense of his
limits and prompt them to help him out."</TE>
<TE>   Others say Fox was foolish to pick a battle he couldn't win abroad
for the sake of a popularity boost at home that probably won't last
long.</TE>
<TE>   "Fox's objective is to tie the country more deeply to the United
States, but he has undermined himself by playing to Mexicans who
oppose that goal," said Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a specialist here
on U.S.-Mexican relations. "He has made himself the victim of a
confessed killer."</TE>

<HD>A New Space Race Is on the Launch Pad</HD>
<DH>Rockets: After falling behind, the U.S. seeks to dominate a
field worth as much as $40 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A powerful new rocket that produces more than 12 times the energy of
Hoover Dam's generators is slated to blast off from Cape Canaveral
next week, launching a battle for the supremacy of space.</LD>
<LD>   In a competition worth as much as $40 billion over the next 20
years, archrivals Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. have developed
rockets intended to dominate the launch business for satellites and
other payloads.</LD>
<LD>   The new rocket designs are leading to the most significant
overhaul of the U.S. launch system since the 1950s, when aerospace
companies began designing ballistic missiles to deliver nuclear
warheads.</LD>
<TE>   The continued reliance on the old rocket technology has cost the
U.S. leadership in the commercial launch business in the last decade,
as Western European nations, China and Russia have moved aggressively
into the market.</TE>
<TE>   In recent decades, the Pentagon and NASA have faltered in efforts
to create advanced-technology space launchers that would dramatically
reduce costs. Former NASA chief Dan Goldin lamented to Congress in
1996 that the space community "should hang its head in shame" over
its failure to protect U.S. leadership in space.</TE>
<TE>   After many false starts, the U.S. finally has two new rocket
models, both boasting more power than any rocket developed since the
Saturn V launched three men to the moon more than three decades ago.
The rockets' launch costs would range from $100 million to $150
million, significantly less than the current generation of vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force would use the new rockets to launch satellites for
spying, weather forecasting, communications, navigation and other
experimental purposes. Although the rockets are funded by the
military for its own missions, commercial versions could help the
U.S. recover business that has been lost to Arianespace, a European
aerospace company.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed is taking the first shot with the launch Wednesday of its
Atlas V. Boeing is scheduled to launch its Delta IV in October.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are astronomical, threatening to make the weaker
competitor a bit player in the space business. The companies, the
nation's two largest defense contractors, have invested more than
$2.5 billion in developing the rockets--Boeing in Huntington Beach
and Canoga Park, Lockheed in Denver and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Just five years ago, Lockheed had three-fourths of the government
launch business, mainly ferrying military and spy satellites into
space. Lockheed rockets now account for only a quarter of the
launches, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "They clearly have a lot riding on this launch," said John Pike,
director of GlobalSecurity.org, a defense and aerospace research
firm. "If it goes flawlessly, it can help out with future government
buys and have a big impact on commercial sales. If it blows up, it
will continue Lockheed's reversal of fortune."</TE>
<TE>   Both Lockheed and Boeing face stiff technical challenges. On first
launches, nearly 80% of new rockets either blow up during liftoff or
fail to reach the correct orbit. Boeing, for example, suffered
back-to-back failures of its previous rocket, the Delta III, in the
last three years and had to pay for a third launch just to show it
could get it off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed executives boast that they have the industry's best
record, having successfully flown five versions of the older Atlas
models on their first attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "People come to us for our track record," said Michael Gass,
Lockheed's vice president for the Atlas program. "We're confident we
can perform."</TE>
<TE>   The commercial market for launch vehicles collapsed with the
tanking of the telecommunications industry, leaving the U.S.
government as the main customer. Analysts said commercial rocket
launches had fallen by more than 50% since 1999, but it appears to be
inching up again after hitting bottom last year.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Asian and European countries have been stepping
up development of launch vehicles, vying to take a bigger piece of
the world's rocket market. Boeing and Lockheed still launch more
rockets--including military missions--than anyone else, but
Arianespace is closing in and now holds the market for launching
commercial satellites into high orbits.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Boeing nor Lockheed is expected to see much profit from
the rockets until later in the decade, when commercial demand is
expected to recover, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Profits are downstream," said Marshall Kaplan, a former rocket
engineer who is director of space programs for Strategic Insight Ltd.
"They are going to be in the red so deeply, it's going to take awhile
to be profitable."</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Pentagon, which has contributed $500 million to both
of the rocket programs, is the primary source of business. Because of
missile defense and homeland security, the Pentagon expects to launch
more military and intelligence satellites that provide remote
sensing, communications and global positioning systems. Most of them
would be carried into space by the new rockets.</TE>
<TE>   But Pentagon officials worry about the possibility of having only
one company producing the launch vehicles and are considering adding
significant new funding in the 2004 defense budget to keep both
programs alive.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon wants two suppliers to ensure the availability of
backup launch vehicles for its highly classified and expensive
payloads. Such precautions began in the aftermath of the explosion of
the space shuttle Challenger in 1986, which left the military
scrambling. At the time, all government missions were supposed to fly
on the shuttle.</TE>
<TE>   For the last decade, the military has been relying on the
expensive Lockheed Martin Titan IV rockets to launch its
more-sophisticated satellites. The rocket, based on 1950s technology,
was costing the U.S. as much as $400 million per mission. The current
program began in 1998, when the Air Force asked both Boeing and
Lockheed to develop a new vehicle, dubbed the evolved expendable
launch vehicle, or EELV.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was to slash launch costs by more than half and
significantly cut the time to prepare a rocket for launch. In fact,
the companies expect to slash launch costs in half from $6,000 per
pound and reduce launch preparation from four weeks to one.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate that Lockheed has spent $1 billion, deciding to
reconfigure its manufacturing facility instead of building a launch
pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County. Unlike,
Boeing, which opted to develop a new core engine, Lockheed is relying
on a Russian-designed RD-180 engine that has been used in another
rocket.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian engine burns kerosene, continuing a tradition in
Russian rocketry of using that fuel instead of the liquid hydrogen
favored by U.S. engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed executives say the design and the manufacturing process
for the Atlas V is significantly different from those of previous
generations of rockets. For instance, Atlas has been designed to
launch even when winds reach 61 knots. Strong winds have been a
persistent bane for rocket launches.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of a hurricane, Lockheed said, the rocket could
fly at any time and in any weather, raising its prospects for
commercial customers who pay for costly delays in launches.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Boeing has invested about $1.5 billion in the program.
It built new launch pads at Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg, as well as
a new manufacturing facility in Decatur, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing also elected to develop a new rocket engine, the first in
three decades.</TE>
<TE>   The company had to develop a new engine for the Delta IV, the
RS-68. The engine, developed at the company's Rocketdyne facility in
Canoga Park, produces 653,000 pounds of thrust, or enough to light up
17 million homes for a short time, said Boeing's Delta program chief
Daniel J. Collins, who noted that it is the first new engine
developed in the U.S. since the space shuttle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a monster," Collins said.</TE>

<LD>A prominent congressman has called for his resignation. Angry
investors have sued him for fraud and racketeering. Others accuse him
of breaking the rules to financially benefit himself and a crony.
He's been jeered by sports fans and mocked in late-night host David
Letterman's Top 10 list. (No. 1: Throws like a girl.)</LD>
<LD>   For such a heavy hitter, baseball Commissioner Allan H. "Bud"
Selig is in a terrible slump.</LD>
<LD>   The 68-year-old owner of the Milwaukee Brewers is under fire from
many quarters as he continues what he characterizes as his campaign
to save the national pastime. But some would say the game needs to be
saved from Selig. His crusade to usher in salary caps, increase
revenue sharing and eliminate struggling teams once again has put him
on a collision course with the powerful players union.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, the Major League Players Assn. executive board voted to
set Aug. 30 as a strike date, the second potential work stoppage on
Selig's watch. The first one was a marathon affair that led to the
cancellation of the 1994 World Series and a public relations
nightmare--the kind Selig says he's prepared to weather again.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as I abhor the thought of a work stoppage, and it would
be gut wrenching, preserving the status quo may be even more gut
wrenching. There are too many clubs that can't make it with this
system," he said. "That's a fact."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone believes it, though, and even those who say Selig may
be right worry that his stewardship ultimately is hurting the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "If baseball were a stock, it would be at an all-time low right
now," said Fay T. Vincent, the former baseball commissioner who was
forced out with a push from Selig. Warren Bennis, a USC management
professor who has served on advisory panels to presidents Johnson,
Nixon, Carter and Reagan, said if he were feeling generous he would
give Selig a grade of C-minus or D for managing the crisis: "I think
he's been a complete disaster."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Balk at All-Star Game</TE>
<TE>   Baseball insiders say Selig has been personally wounded by such
comments as well as collateral questions about his credibility and
intentions. The criticism only intensified after he called a halt to
last month's nationally televised All-Star game as it was tied 7-7 in
the 11th inning. The decision triggered catcalls from the crowd at
Selig's home field--Miller Park in Milwaukee--and inflamed baseball
purists around the country. Cameras caught Selig throwing up his
hands when the managers told him they had run out of pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   Most agree the man handpicked by fellow team owners to oversee the
sport has done much to help it bounce back after the 232-day strike
in 1994-95. Adding wild card teams has made pennant races exciting
later into the season, and promoting rivalries with interleague play
has helped increase attendance. His administration initiated limited
revenue sharing among owners and negotiated baseball's richest
national television contract, a $2.5-billion deal with Fox.</TE>
<TE>   But Selig also has the knack of taking what should be the sport's
shining moment and overshadowing it with controversy. That's what he
did last fall, just 48 hours after one of the most exciting World
Series in history, when he announced that baseball would kill off two
teams through "contraction."</TE>
<TE>   "It's painful for me to watch Bud get skewered on all these
things," said Jeff Smulyan, former owner of the Seattle Mariners.
"Bud is much better one-on-one than he is standing in front of the
camera. I don't think his fundamental nature comes through that
well."</TE>
<TE>   Selig wasn't born for the limelight.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, he was so shy he couldn't look you in the eye, said
brother Jerry. His glasses, mop of hair and habit of cupping his hand
to his ear so he can hear makes him look like the history professor
he once aspired to be. Friends and foes alike, however, say the
rumpled manner hides a cagey insider whose love for the game can't be
matched.</TE>
<TE>   He was introduced to baseball by his mother, a Russian immigrant
and longtime fan who would take him to see minor-league games. His
fondest memory is the 1949 trip they took to New York to watch games
at Ebbets Field, the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium. Selig was
enthralled when, on his 15th birthday, Yankee fans crooned "Happy
Birthday" during the 7th-inning stretch--only to discover they were
serenading Yankee Manager Casey Stengel.</TE>
<TE>   Selig wanted to play the game but couldn't hit a curve. So he
became the ultimate fan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Love for the Game</TE>
<TE>   As a teen he ingested statistics and lore. While a student at the
University of Wisconsin, his radio was tuned constantly to the
play-by-play of the Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox and the old
Milwaukee Braves. After graduation and a short stint in the Army--he
served six months before being discharged because of a bleeding
ulcer--he went to work at the family's car dealership. Baseball was
never far from his heart.</TE>
<TE>   Married straight out of college, Selig took his two daughters on
annual baseball road trips. When the Milwaukee Braves went public in
1963, he plunked down $30,000 and became the team's largest public
shareholder. And when his first wife divorced him in 1975, she all
but named baseball as his mistress.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what he did, 24/7," said Sari Selig Kramer, 44, their
daughter, who carries in her wallet a snapshot of herself as a
3-year-old at a game with her dad. "He was either at the game,
talking about the game.... That's all we knew."</TE>
<TE>   His tie to the game was so visceral that Selig said he felt "raped
and devastated" when the Braves left for Atlanta in 1965. He sold his
stock in protest and gathered a civic group determined to bring
baseball back. Selig spent the next three years unsuccessfully
lobbying for an expansion team with such determination that some
owners regarded him as a "leper."</TE>
<TE>   Yet he never gave up, and his group purchased the old Seattle
Pilots out of bankruptcy six days before the 1970 season. The
Milwaukee Brewers were born.</TE>
<TE>   "What that period taught me was ... tenacity. Persistence. I kept
getting up off the floor," Selig said.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase ushered Selig into the clubby world of baseball
owners who once dismissed him, a conclave dominated by oversized egos
and bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   He became the league's human switchboard, its social glue. Selig
made himself indispensable by volunteering for committee assignments
and working the phones. Deferential, sympathetic, knee-slapping
funny, Selig became a consensus builder and master politician through
a combination of charm and relentlessness.</TE>
<TE>   "He just grinds and grinds and never gives up," said Peter
Ueberroth, a former baseball commissioner who also ran the 1984 Los
Angeles Olympics. Added Vincent, "He's a compulsive schmoozer."</TE>
<TE>   As a small-market owner, Selig schmoozed with an agenda.</TE>
<TE>   With no personal fortune to fall back on, he was forced to run the
Brewers with ruthless cost cutting, earning him the nickname "Budget
Bud." Although the team turned a profit, Selig said he soon realized
that teams such as his were hobbled by a growing revenue gap with the
big teams. The culprit: free agency.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poised to Take Control</TE>
<TE>   Owners despised the salary-bidding wars but believed they were
forced to join them to stay alive at the turnstiles. An attempt to
break the cycle culminated when owners, directed by Ueberroth,
secretly agreed to shun each other's free agents after the 1985
season. They were fined a collective $280 million in 1987 for
collusion.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent said Selig was a "ringleader" in the collusion effort, a
charge Selig adamantly denies. But what is clear is that in 1992,
amid fears that Vincent was too labor friendly to take on the
powerful Major League Players Assn., Selig helped engineer a
boardroom coup that forced Vincent's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "People say I underestimated him. I certainly did," Vincent said.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1992, Selig replaced Vincent as interim commissioner,
an appointment that broke tradition. Since the Black Sox scandal gave
birth to the commissioner's post in 1921, owners have taken pains to
select people from outside their ranks to give the post at least the
appearance of independence.</TE>
<TE>   Selig's leadership was cemented when he was elected permanent
commissioner in 1998. Unlike the salary cap Selig wants to impose on
players, his pay has grown from the $1 million a year he was paid
when he started as commissioner to the roughly $6 million a year that
baseball officials confirm he will be paid by the time his term
expires in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Through the interim years, Selig remained president and the
largest shareholder of the Brewers. After his permanent appointment,
he put his shares in a blind trust and handed the job of running the
team over to his daughter Wendy Selig-Prieb.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his financial ties and tenure as a small-market owner have
fueled charges of conflict of interest and cronyism as Selig
proceeds--with the unanimous vote of owners--to dramatically rework
the economics of the game. Some opponents wonder whether Selig can be
trusted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Contraction Reaction</TE>
<TE>   When Selig announced last fall that two teams had to go for the
good of the game, and word leaked out that one of them was Minnesota,
many smelled a conspiracy to generate greater television revenue and
boost attendance for the lowly Brewers, roughly 200 miles away.
Worse, critics felt it could be a payoff for Selig friend and Twins'
owner Carl Pohlad by offering to buy him out for an estimated $50
million over the club's estimated market price.</TE>
<TE>   The heat became particularly intense after it was revealed that
Selig received a $3-million short-term loan from Pohlad's bank to
help the Brewers after the 1994-95 strike. The deal raised questions
about whether Selig had violated a prohibition on owners from lending
money to each other without league permission. Selig insists the loan
was proper.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I've borrowed very little money in my lifetime," Selig
said. "He [Pohlad] was a friend. He was a banker."</TE>
<TE>   Other owners didn't seem to care. But it only inflamed controversy
and criticism of Selig that started two days after the Arizona
Diamondbacks beat the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series.
His announcement that baseball would have to cut two financially
struggling teams pierced a euphoria that was all the more poignant
because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The furor was followed by allegations from the Massachusetts
attorney general that Selig has steered the sale of the Boston Red
Sox to baseball insiders as part of a grand scheme to cut another
team. Selig denied influencing the sale, which owners approved for
$90 million less than the highest bid.</TE>
<TE>   Minority owners of the Montreal Expos, the second team targeted
for elimination, sued Selig and other top baseball officials last
month, alleging fraud, conspiracy and racketeering. They claim Selig
and others conspired with majority owner Jeffrey Loria to drive down
the value of the franchise to facilitate the league's February
purchase of it for $120 million as part of their plan to perhaps one
day shut it down.</TE>
<TE>   Selig created another row last month when he predicted that two
teams would fail to make their payroll. When that failed to
materialize, league officials backpedaled and downplayed the
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford economist Roger Noll, an expert on baseball labor issues,
said Selig's verbal brinksmanship has been part of a plan to prompt a
strike: "He's doing a good job planning a train wreck," Noll said.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner underwent his worst public flogging during
congressional hearings on a bill that would strip baseball's
cherished antitrust exemption for any teams that are eliminated or
moved. Selig used the January hearings to release figures purporting
to show that all but two of the 30 teams were losing money.</TE>
<TE>   Seizing on Selig's loan from Pohlad, the bill's author, Rep. John
Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), called for the commissioner's resignation.
Conyers also cast doubt on Selig's figures about financial woes.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see is not what you get with him," Conyers said at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   Selig says he's taking the long view, leaving it to the "next
generation" to decided whether he's done the right thing for the
sport. For now, he's trying to shrug off the flak. After all, what do
you expect when you're making long-overdue changes to one of
America's most cherished institutions?</TE>
<TE>   "My dad always taught me that the path of least resistance is
generally the worst one," he said. "It doesn't solve the problem.
These [baseball's financial woes] are problems that should have been
solved 10, 20, 30 years ago."</TE>

<TE>   Selig Is Pitching Some Changes</TE>
<TE>   Major league baseball commissioner Bud Selig says changes are
necessary to make the game more competitive and profitable.</TE>
<TE>   His proposals include:</TE>
<TE>   * Increased revenue sharing. Baseball's 30 major league ballclubs
share 20% of their $2.8 billion in local revenue. Selig wants to
increase it to 50%.</TE>
<TE>   * Luxury tax. Institute a 50% tax on portions of team payrolls
exceeding $98 million. Under that proposal, the Dodgers and six other
teams would have been taxed. The money would subsidize low-revenue
teams.</TE>
<TE>   * Payroll minimums. Establish a $45-million minimum payroll so
owners would be forced to spend on players instead of pocketing
shared revenue as profits.</TE>
<TE>   * Contraction. Eliminate financially struggling teams.</TE>
<TE>   * A worldwide draft. Prevent costly bidding wars for foreign
players by including them in the sport's draft, which allows teams to
take turns picking talent.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Police to Release Findings on Shooting of
Mentally Ill Woman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Long Beach Police Department will release for the first time
findings from investigations into the Jan. 19 officer shooting death
of Marcella Byrd, a schizophrenic black woman.</LD>
<LD>   Police Chief Jerome Lance will discuss the separate findings of
the department's internal investigation and those of the Los Angeles
County coroner and district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   The public can question the chief at what is the monthly general
membership meeting of the Long Beach chapter of the National Assn.
for the Advancement of Colored People. The meeting is Sunday at 3:15
p.m. at Cal Rec Center, 1515 Martin Luther King Blvd., Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Naomi Rainey, president of the chapter, said an NAACP-led
coalition formed after Byrd's shooting that has examined police "use
of force and use of force training" will announce its recommendations
for department reform.</TE>
<TE>   The officers' killing of Byrd during the Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday weekend generated a broad-based outcry in the community and
inspired a protest by a civil rights group called Peace Action
Network.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting, which ended a four-minute standoff with police near
downtown after Byrd refused to drop the knife, also triggered a
record number of complaints to the NAACP chapter, whose board members
condemned the shooting and demanded a meeting with the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Community concern was mounting and protests were held before Lance
and his top managers met at a February NAACP forum.</TE>
<TE>   Lance chose to present his department's findings first to the
chapter membership because it had generated questions he could not
then answer, a department spokesman said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   After he defended his officers' actions long before the
investigation's outcome, Lance irked some of the February forum's 100
attendees.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he was credited for making the effort to meet with
concerned citizens.</TE>

<HD>No Peace, Only Grief in Cemetery Scandal</HD>
<DH>Courts: Families of those who were dug up in Santa Fe
Springs call settlement inadequate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the macabre facts at a Santa Fe Springs cemetery came to light
more than six years ago, the pain and anger felt by relatives and
others, who thought their loved ones were in a safe resting place,
has only grown with time.</LD>
<LD>   First, there was the outrage when it was discovered that workers
at Paradise Memorial Park dug up old graves to resell the plots,
sometimes stacking six or seven bodies in a single grave.</LD>
<LD>   The pain deepened a few years later when relatives and others
learned through the lawsuits and claims filed in the case that there
would be little compensation for the illegal activities at the
cemetery. The fact that Paradise's owners were sentenced to jail and
ordered to pay restitution didn't lessen the angst.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the final indignity--in the form of compensation checks--has
been arriving in the mail for the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Joanne Lister, a retiree in Norwalk whose baby grandson was buried
at Paradise in 1964, received $136. Her daughter, the infant's
mother, who lives in Oklahoma, received $219.50.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Taylor, a retired nightclub manager whose mother was buried
at Paradise in December 1971, received $379.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts," Taylor said. "I don't even know where my mother is."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Bruce E. Mitchell, who
handled the case involving more than 7,000 valid claims and about 50
law firms, ordered July 26 that the checks could be sent out from a
settlement of a little less than $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The turn of events was particularly galling to some in the African
American community because many working-class black families had come
to rely on the cemetery. Founded in 1930 on Florence Avenue, Paradise
had accepted their business for years at unheard-of rates of about
$200. Now, as they receive the checks meant to atone for their pain
and suffering, some claimants bitterly say the lawyers involved in
the case got the lion's share of the money.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the lawyers are duds," Lister said. "They didn't handle
the case correctly. I didn't get enough money for what they did,
digging the bodies up."</TE>
<TE>   "They got all that money and that's all we got?" Taylor said. "It
isn't right for that to happen to a dead person. It's inhumane."</TE>
<TE>   But Lister and Taylor also know that their compensation could have
been worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Some folks just got $100," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Many claimants are also upset by cemetery workers' protests of
innocence. They told investigators that they believed they had done
nothing wrong--even though it was clear that the whereabouts of many
remains were unknown. Some disinterred remains were found in a
7-foot-high, 50-foot-long dirt pile behind a tool shed.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't right," Taylor repeatedly said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   Some claimants hoped their settlement checks would help them find
a new place to bury their loved ones. Lister put that out of her mind
quickly when she received the check.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I used it to buy groceries," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The unhappiness over the amounts of individual settlements in the
Paradise case, which sparked an investigation of similar practices at
other cemeteries in Los Angeles, isn't new to attorney Mike Arias. As
one of the lead attorneys for the plaintiffs, he was part of a small
army of litigators who handled the cases for their clients.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I'm not surprised by the anger," Arias said when told of
the most recent criticism. "People are never going to be completely
happy with this case.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing I can do about [the settlement amounts]. I wish I
could."</TE>
<TE>   Cemetery and mortuary defendants in the case agreed in 1999 to pay
a little less than $8 million to settle legal actions filed against
them. Plaintiffs' attorneys from the law firms involved in the case,
including Arias' practice, received about a third of the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $2 million was set aside for the care and
maintenance of the Santa Fe Springs cemetery, which hasn't been
allowed to inter more corpses since the scandal came to light.</TE>
<TE>   It took the lawyers, the defendants and Mitchell several years to
sift through about 15,000 claims in the case, whittling down the
number of valid claims to 7,000. Compensation was based on the
relationship with the deceased and status of the gravesite.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, it became clear that the payments would be in the
hundreds of dollars, not in the thousands. There wasn't a defendant
with deep pockets to pay the kind of compensation many were hoping
for.</TE>
<TE>   The wealthiest defendants said they weren't responsible for the
abuses. The state was dismissed as a defendant. Paradise's insurance
company said its coverage did not cover criminal acts at the
cemetery. The mortuaries that did business with Paradise said they
didn't know about any irregularities there. And the cemetery's
operators said they didn't have any money.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Arias pointed out, claims were settled for several
thousands of dollars for those who suffered the most egregious
abuses.</TE>
<TE>   He bristled at suggestions that lawyers were paid exorbitantly at
the expense of claimants.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked seven years on this case," he said. "We had to split
fees with other law firms. Our work, we figured out, came to
something less than $75 an hour. And there was an additional 1,000
[hours of work] that we were not compensated for."</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't lessened the pain of people who were shocked to learn
of the irregularities discovered at Paradise Memorial Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think we'd get rich or anything," Lister said. "I
thought maybe I'd get $600. This is insulting."</TE>

<HD>Minister Charged in Student Aid Fraud</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man counseled college-bound teenagers to falsely
claim they were orphans, federal officials say. His lawyer calls the
claims unfounded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles minister has been indicted on charges of advising
college-bound teenagers how to cheat the student aid system by
falsely claiming to be orphans, the U.S. attorney's office said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Ozell Clifford Brazil, 52, was accused of counseling students
about how to beat the system in seminars he gave from 1996 through
2000 at Loyola Marymount University and First AME Church, where he
was ordained.</LD>
<LD>   A grand jury indictment charged him with 13 counts of mail fraud
and seven counts of defrauding the student financial aid program.
Thirteen of the students Brazil advised were granted immunity but
must pay back more than $250,000 in school aid.</LD>
<TE>   Brazil could not be reached for comment, but his lawyer, William
J. Genego, called the charges unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "Rev. Brazil has known about the investigation for more than two
years and he continues to adamantly assert his innocence," Genego
said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the attorney said, Brazil has helped many hundreds
of "at-risk youngsters get into college, a lot of them on
scholarship. I think it's unfortunate that because a few of the
people might have misused the information he gave them, the
government wants to hold him responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Brazil founded his Los Angeles Community Outreach Program at
Loyola Marymount in 1995. His lawyer described the program as a
yearlong "self-esteem course," only part of which was devoted to
applying for financial aid.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, which was returned Thursday, Brazil
knowingly assisted students in filing false applications for federal
student aid with the U.S. Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to instructions that he provided during seminars and
private meetings with students, Brazil wrote letters to colleges
falsely claiming that the students were not receiving any financial
help from their parents, the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Assistant U.S. Atty. Paul Rochmes, students paid $75
to $250 to attend Brazil's seminars. Genego called the figures
misleading. He said the amounts represented requested donations for
the yearlong course.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were nominal contributions. My client had no financial
motive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rochmes said the government is taking steps to recover more than
$250,000 in aid the 13 students received, plus interest and possible
civil penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities are also attempting to track down all other
students who might have attended Brazil's seminars and filed
fraudulent aid applications.</TE>
<TE>   He said the loss figure could rise significantly as more bogus
applications are identified.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office said neither Loyola Marymount nor the
First AME Church is suspected of involvement in the alleged fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil earned a law degree and two master's degrees before he was
ordained as a minister at the First AME Church in South-Central Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He served as a pastor in Lompoc for a year, then returned to Los
Angeles, where he established the outreach program. In its first
year, he said he was providing guidance to about 450 high school
students.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil is scheduled to be arraigned Oct. 15 in Los Angeles federal
court.</TE>

<HD>Defendant Takes Stand, Tells of Abuse</HD>
<DH>Court: Eileen Childs, charged with attempted murder and
arson, testifies that she and her daughter were the victims when they
fought her controlling husband.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eileen Childs, charged with trying to kill her husband to collect
more than $1.4 million in insurance money, testified Friday that her
marriage was beset with physical and sexual abuse along with constant
financial problems.</LD>
<LD>   The Simi Valley woman said her husband, Larry Childs, 55,
repeatedly hit her, forced sex on her, beat their four children and
suffered depression over his job and credit card bills. She said her
husband was a controlling and high-strung man who even picked out
what bra and panties she could buy.</LD>
<LD>   But prosecutors say that on March 24, Childs and her 19-year-old
daughter, Jennifer, an aspiring pop singer, tried to kill Larry
Childs by setting fire to his bed and then beating him with a
baseball bat. The pair wanted to use his insurance money to open a
Jiffy Lube franchise and jump-start Jennifer's career, prosecutors
contend. They are charged with attempted murder and arson.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Childs, who was injured in the altercation, has strongly
denied ever abusing his family.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County Superior Court on Friday, an occasionally
tearful Eileen Childs recounted her troubled past that began as a
child shuttled among four or five abusive foster homes. Married and
divorced twice, she met her third husband, Larry Childs, while
working as his secretary. Larry Childs was married at the time, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Their marriage was a rocky one, she said. Larry Childs was
demanding and expected his children and stepchildren to perform a
list of chores every day before going to school, she testified. If
they didn't, he would grab them roughly by the arm or throw them
against the wall and berate them, Childs said.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs' 17-year-old son, Bradley Pilloud, testified that he
went to live with his biological father at age 13 because of the
abuse suffered at the hands of his stepfather. He said Larry Childs
routinely slapped and punched him.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Jennifer Childs testified that her stepfather made
repeated sexual advances toward her.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs said that, days before the fire, her husband tried
to show their 11-year-old son Jacob how to throw a baseball. When the
two returned, the boy was crying hysterically, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He said his dad got angry with him for not playing ball right,"
Childs said. "He said his dad threw the ball at him. I saw the
imprint of the stitches from the baseball on his chest."</TE>
<TE>   Financially, the family was living on the edge, Eileen Childs
testified. She said she bought almost everything on credit and the
family spent an average of $200 a week on clothes. A recent $15,000
remodeling job was paid for on credit and they had outstanding
mortgages on two homes, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we discussed money in any way ... he'd get extremely angry,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs, who suffers from lupus, a chronic inflammatory
illness, said she cashed in a $132,000 life insurance policy to take
care of financial obligations in the event the disease killed her.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say she forged her husband's name on the policy, but
the woman said she was a joint policyholder.</TE>
<TE>   She took the money and bought a $41,000 sport utility vehicle and
used the rest to pay off loans, she said.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of the fire, Childs testified, candles had been
lighted all around the house to mask the odor of meat, which made her
ill. After her husband went to bed, she lay down with her son.</TE>
<TE>   Childs, who said she couldn't remember if a candle had been
burning in the bedroom, said she smelled smoke and her husband came
running, confronting her and Jennifer.</TE>
<TE>   "He grabbed us by the hair and started pulling us toward the
kitchen," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, she said, her daughter began hitting her husband
with a baseball bat. "Then I hit him with a glass," she said. "We
were both thinking he set the fire."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys played a taped interview Simi Valley police
detectives conducted with Eileen Childs. On the tape, Childs
described her husband as depressed, high strung and worried about
losing his job.</TE>
<TE>   One unidentified police officer seemed baffled that the women
would start hitting Larry Childs with a baseball bat when the fire
broke out. Another officer pointed out that a dismantled smoke alarm
was found under the sofa cushion.</TE>
<TE>   Childs said she was just trying to defend her family.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it wrong to protect yourself, to protect your daughter?" she
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony continues Monday.</TE>

<HD>School Choice Falling Short</HD>
<DH>Education: The number of students eligible to transfer to a
better campus greatly exceeds available seats. Voucher movement may
benefit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A severe shortage of classroom space in large urban school districts
is undermining a new federal education law's promise to give 3.5
million poor children the choice of better public schools this fall.</LD>
<LD>   One of the key features of the "No Child Left Behind" law, touted
by the Bush administration as a remedy for ailing schools, offers
students from low-income families the opportunity to switch from
troubled campuses to better ones in the same district.</LD>
<LD>   But in the Los Angeles Unified School District, where nearly
230,000 youngsters qualify for transfers at public expense, there are
as few as 100 seats available in better schools. Similar shortages
are expected to limit access to top schools in New York, Chicago,
Baltimore, Sacramento and other cities.</LD>
<TE>   School administrators and others say the new decree will not
better the prospects of the vast majority of low-income students in
more than 8,600 struggling schools identified by government
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no empty seats in the best public schools," said Diane
Ravitch, an education researcher at New York University and assistant
secretary of education under former President Bush. "If you don't
have any choices, then it's hollow."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some educators now believe that the failure of large
school systems to deliver choice for legions of poor students could
give new impetus to the private school voucher movement, which was
recently reinvigorated by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   In most districts, including L.A. Unified, parents whose children
attend the affected schools have not yet been notified of their
transfer options. But some who have heard of the program are dismayed
that they may be unable to take advantage of it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's upsetting. I'd like to have the best for my son," said Elva
Garcia Mills, whose son Daniel attends Belmont High School, one of
120 Los Angeles campuses that students can theoretically leave this
year. "Some schools are better than others."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the U.S. Department of Education acknowledge that
crowded school systems may need several years to comply with the law.
But they expect districts to make a good-faith effort this first
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal here is to change our understanding of how public
education is delivered," said Eugene Hickok, undersecretary of
education. "This will be the first time that federal education policy
speaks directly to parents."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of letting parents choose better public schools grew out
of a political compromise in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration early on favored giving families of
children in faltering schools federally funded vouchers to pay for
tutoring or tuition at private schools. Democrats balked at the idea
for fear vouchers would drain money from public schools. The two
sides settled on offering public school choice.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that a voucher program
in Cleveland allowing students to attend private parochial schools at
public expense did not violate the constitutional separation of
church and state.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides in the case predicted that the decision would trigger a
national push for vouchers, charter schools and other forms of school
choice. If public school choice falters, that could fuel the voucher
movement, some educators say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very sensitive issue," said Dennis Van Roekel, vice
president-elect of the National Education Assn., the country's
largest teachers union. "When people criticize what currently exists,
their solution is to say we need to take children somewhere else.
That is not a solution."</TE>
<TE>   The public school transfer option is part of a sweeping education
law that President Bush signed in January. It also requires states to
test students annually and demands that schools have "highly
qualified" teachers within four years.</TE>
<TE>   Several large urban districts call the new requirements on teacher
quality and school choice unrealistic. The school choice provisions
put a financial burden on districts, which must use federal funds to
pay for transportation, tutoring and other services.</TE>
<TE>   Many educators say the law is unnecessary, pointing out that many
school systems and states already allow students to transfer to their
choice of schools and programs.</TE>
<TE>   All of the under-performing campuses affected by the new law
landed on the federal list because they failed to adequately raise
test scores for two years running.</TE>
<TE>   Districts are supposed to give priority to the lowest-achieving
children from poor families at these schools. But large urban
districts have an enormous number of children in that category.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, for example, officials have just 2,800 openings for
125,000 eligible low-income elementary students from 179 schools.</TE>
<TE>   So the district is offering transfers to just 29,000 students at
50 campuses. Parents will learn next week whether their children get
to move.</TE>
<TE>   The space crunch is even more severe in Los Angeles, where nearly
one-third of 736,000 students are eligible to attend new schools this
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the district's open classroom seats already are occupied
by students bused from overcrowded schools or by others who attend
magnet programs.</TE>
<TE>   District leaders have identified 50,000 of the lowest achievers
for the transfer option. But officials roughly estimate that they
will have between 100 and several thousand seats available when
school starts.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer argues that money would be better spent supporting
the district's academic reforms in reading, math and teacher
training, which he says are driving up test scores in many
lower-performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to move children from one building to another building does
not guarantee that they are going to learn that much better," Romer
said. "We can take the existing school and make it work."</TE>
<TE>   Lupe Mendoza-Fernandez, a parent and teacher in Los Angeles,
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Running away doesn't solve the problem," said Mendoza-Fernandez,
who works at an elementary school on the target list and has two
children at a high school also on the list.</TE>
<TE>   When you send "kids out to other communities, the children do not
have the same opportunities," she said. "They can't stay for
extracurricular tutoring because they have to catch the bus."</TE>
<TE>   The new law presents small rural school districts with another set
of problems. In far-flung communities, students will have to travel
great distances for better schools. Children in one Wyoming town, for
example, face a 70-mile commute to the next-nearest school in their
district.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators say that losing even a few students from a small
school can skew test scores. And school officials worry about the
economic fallout in small towns with shaky economies if families move
to be closer to better schools.</TE>
<TE>   These concerns weigh on Don Middleton, superintendent of the Clear
Creek School District in the Rocky Mountains about 35 miles west of
Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Middleton is notifying parents of the 200-student Georgetown
Elementary of their option to transfer to another campus about 15
miles away in Idaho Springs. But Middleton also is urging families to
stay in Georgetown, a tourist stop on Interstate 70 about midway
between Denver and Vail. The town is known to locals for its historic
buildings and its looping railroad.</TE>
<TE>   "I have trouble getting teachers in a place like Georgetown,"
Middleton said. "I just don't understand the concept of abandoning a
school in places where communities are distant and towns are
different. I don't see how it's a viable alternative."</TE>
<TE>   Some educators say local officials should consider more creative
options, such as running multiple schools in the same buildings or
offering education over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "If the public school systems have their heart in this provision,
which they don't, they would be coming up with imaginative forms of
choice in their districts," said Chester E. Finn Jr., an assistant
secretary of education in the Reagan administration and head of the
Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, a private Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "What we see all over the country are districts basically trying
to get out from having to comply in any serious way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most school districts won't know the actual impact of public
school choice until they hear back from parents in the coming weeks.
But a handful of school systems have already set their rosters, and
they say interest has been lukewarm.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,300 students were eligible in the Howard County Public
School System of suburban Baltimore, for example, but only 63
students' families asked for transfers, district officials reported.</TE>
<TE>   In the nearby Baltimore City Public School System, 30,000 students
qualified but only 347 students' families asked for new schools.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Baltimore has just 194 open seats. And that means at least
100 students who seek transfers will not get the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in both districts say that parents want to keep their
children off buses. And, they believe, most families are satisfied
with their local schools.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to live up to the letter and spirit of 'No Child Left
Behind' as a school district," said Baltimore Supt. Carmen Russo.
"But in the long run, the answer to this is that all of our schools
have to be better so no one has to flee them."</TE>

<HD>Newest Cal State Campus Debuts</HD>
<DH>Education: Governor and faculty rejoice during opening
rites for the university near Camarillo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND and JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling its creation a "herculean achievement," Gov. Gray Davis on
Friday declared Cal State Channel Islands officially open, marking
the end of Ventura County's decades-long wait for a public
university.</LD>
<LD>   "For too long, Ventura County has been the largest county in the
state without a four-year public university," Davis said at a
pomp-filled ceremony attended by more than 1,000 people who gathered
on the campus near Camarillo. "Those days are over, and now the
county is home to what will be one of the greatest public
universities in the world," he said.</LD>
<LD>   When the new university opens its doors to students for the first
time Aug. 26, it will "open the doors of opportunity for generations
of students to come," Davis said.</LD>
<TE>   The governor was among many dignitaries who gathered in a grassy
quad surrounded by the sun-soaked, Spanish-style buildings that make
up the campus, the former site of Camarillo State Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like giving birth," observed state Assemblywoman
Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara).</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo), a former Ventura
County high school teacher who pushed legislation that helped make
the new campus a reality, drew a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome to the miracle on Lewis Road," he said. "It doesn't get
any better than this, does it?"</TE>
<TE>   Locating a university on the sprawling grounds of the old mental
hospital was O'Connell's idea, but one that initially came from his
mother, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A nurse at the state hospital 40 years ago, she always thought the
buildings should house a university and would talk of going to work
on "the campus," O'Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom," the senator said, "we finally made it."</TE>
<TE>   As the politicians spoke, faculty members, staff, students,
philanthropists and community members listened and clapped, using
programs to fan themselves or shield their faces from the beating
sun.</TE>
<TE>   University President Richard Rush--dressed in a burgundy robe and
gold medallion--presided over the ceremony, which began with a
procession of faculty members and administrators clad in colorful
academic regalia.</TE>
<TE>   As guests drifted to their seats, they were treated to musical
selections played by the Channel Islands and Port Hueneme high school
bands.</TE>
<TE>   "I know many of you have dreamed of this day for many decades,"
Rush said. "Welcome to your university."</TE>
<TE>   He also thanked those who came before him, particularly founding
President J. Handel Evans, who is credited with rallying financial
and community support for the school.</TE>
<TE>   For Evans, the day was bittersweet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm no longer connected to it, but the sweet part is that it's
finally opening," he said. "It's been a long, uphill climb."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's opening capped a 30-year campaign to bring a four-year
public university to Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Early efforts were hampered by a lack of funding and no suitable
site for the campus.</TE>
<TE>   But the closure of Camarillo State Hospital in 1997 paved the way
for Cal State Channel Islands, the 23rd campus in the CSU system.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,300 transfer students have enrolled at the college so far,
and the first freshman class will be admitted in fall 2003.</TE>
<TE>   By 2025, the university anticipates serving 15,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking forward to the campus growing, growing, growing,"
said CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed.</TE>
<TE>   And with enrollment in the CSU system jumping by nearly 22,000
this fall, Reed said, the timing of the opening couldn't be any
better.</TE>
<TE>   "This campus is a godsend," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Across a tiled courtyard where dignitaries milled about prior to
the ceremony, Ventura County Supt. of Schools Charles Weis said the
university will mean an immediate increase in the county's
below-average rate of high school students going on to four-year
colleges.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest thing for Ventura County, ever," he said.
"It's just incredible."</TE>
<TE>   That excitement never waned, from a formal breakfast in the
morning to a post-ceremony reception in the afternoon, where guests
chatted and sampled finger foods as they were serenaded by a
seven-piece mariachi band.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Chapman, a biology professor who came to Ventura County
from Australia to teach at the university, beamed as she spoke of the
chance to help develop new courses and curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to follow. You lead from whichever way the path
takes you," she said. "Looking around today at the buildings and
everything, it just feels right."</TE>
<TE>   When college boosters first proposed building a new Cal State
campus in Ventura County, they were hoping to make it easier for
students such as Richard Ramirez to earn their bachelor's degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, a 41-year-old Port Hueneme resident, served for 20 years
in the Marines before deciding to return to school. He earned his
associate's degree from Oxnard College, but soon realized he could
not afford to spend the time or the money to attend a public
four-year university outside the county.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the junior biology and pre-med major can't keep the grin off
his face as he talks about the thrill of being a member of the
school's inaugural class.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty excited," he said. "'I wish classes were starting this
week."</TE>

<HD>Newest Cal State Campus Debuts</HD>
<DH>Education: Governor and faculty rejoice during opening
rites for long-awaited university near Camarillo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND and JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling its creation a "herculean achievement," Gov. Gray Davis on
Friday declared Cal State Channel Islands officially open, marking
the end of Ventura County's decades-long wait for a public
university.</LD>
<LD>   "For too long, Ventura County has been the largest county in the
state without a four-year public university," Davis said at a
pomp-filled ceremony attended by more than 1,000 people who gathered
on the campus near Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   "Those days are over, and now the county is home to what will be
one of the greatest public universities in the world," he said.</LD>
<TE>   When the new university opens its doors to students for the first
time Aug. 26, it will "open the doors of opportunity for generations
of students to come," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor was among many dignitaries who gathered in a grassy
quad surrounded by the sun-soaked, Spanish-style buildings that make
up the campus, the former site of Camarillo State Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like giving birth," observed state Assemblywoman
Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara).</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo), a former Ventura
County high school teacher who pushed legislation that helped make
the new campus a reality, drew a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome to the miracle on Lewis Road," he said. "It doesn't get
any better than this, does it?"</TE>
<TE>   Locating a university on the sprawling grounds of the old mental
hospital was O'Connell's idea, but one that initially came from his
mother, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A nurse at the state hospital 40 years ago, she always thought the
buildings should house a university and would talk of going to work
on "the campus," O'Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom," the senator said, "we finally made it."</TE>
<TE>   As the politicians spoke, faculty members, staff, students,
philanthropists and community members listened and clapped, using
programs to fan themselves or shield their faces from the beating
sun.</TE>
<TE>   University President Richard Rush--dressed in a burgundy robe and
gold medallion--presided over the ceremony, which began with a
procession of faculty members and administrators clad in colorful
academic regalia.</TE>
<TE>   As guests drifted to their seats, they were treated to musical
selections played by the Channel Islands and Port Hueneme high school
bands.</TE>
<TE>   "I know many of you have dreamed of this day for many decades,"
Rush said. "Welcome to your university."</TE>
<TE>   He also thanked those who came before him, particularly founding
President J. Handel Evans, who is credited with rallying financial
and community support for the school.</TE>
<TE>   For Evans, the day was bittersweet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm no longer connected to it, but the sweet part is that it's
finally opening," he said. "It's been a long, uphill climb."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's opening capped a 30-year campaign to bring a four-year
public university to Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Early efforts were hampered by a lack of funding and no suitable
site for the campus.</TE>
<TE>   But the closure of Camarillo State Hospital in 1997 paved the way
for Cal State Channel Islands, the 23rd campus in the CSU system.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,300 transfer students have enrolled at the college so far,
and the first freshman class will be admitted in fall 2003.</TE>
<TE>   By 2025, the university anticipates serving 15,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking forward to the campus growing, growing, growing,"
said CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed.</TE>
<TE>   And with enrollment in the CSU system jumping by nearly 22,000
this fall, Reed said, the timing of the opening couldn't be any
better.</TE>
<TE>   "This campus is a godsend," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Across a tiled courtyard where dignitaries milled about prior to
the ceremony, Ventura County Supt. of Schools Charles Weis said the
university will mean an immediate increase in the county's
below-average rate of high school students going on to four-year
colleges.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest thing for Ventura County, ever," he said.
"It's just incredible."</TE>
<TE>   That excitement never waned, from a formal breakfast in the
morning to a post-ceremony reception in the afternoon, where guests
chatted and sampled finger foods as they were serenaded by a
seven-piece mariachi band.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Chapman, a biology professor who came to Ventura County
from Australia to teach at the university, beamed as she spoke of the
chance to help develop new courses and curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to follow. You lead from whichever way the path
takes you," she said. "Looking around today at the buildings and
everything, it just feels right."</TE>
<TE>   When college boosters first proposed building a new Cal State
campus in Ventura County, they were hoping to make it easier for
students such as Richard Ramirez to earn their bachelor's degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, a 41-year-old Port Hueneme resident, served for 20 years
in the Marines before deciding to return to school.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his associate's degree from Oxnard College, but soon
realized he could not afford to spend the time or the money to attend
a public four-year university outside the county.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the junior biology and pre-med major can't keep the grin off
his face as he talks about the thrill of being a member of the
school's inaugural class.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty excited," he said. "'I wish classes were starting this
week."</TE>

<HD>Man Held After Spectator Is Slain, 2 Wounded in Drag Race
Shootings</HD>
<DH>Violence: Police say the victim and suspect had exchanged
words all night during event at Irwindale Speedway, staged to keep
illegal racing off the streets.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dispute between two spectators at the Irwindale Speedway on
Thursday night ended in a shooting that left one dead and two
bystanders wounded.</LD>
<LD>   Leo Elder, 35, of Los Angeles died at a hospital after he was shot
once in the back, police said. The suspect, Ramon Reyes, 20, was
arrested in the parking lot and held on $1-million bail.</LD>
<LD>   About 2,000 people in the stands had been watching street legal
races, in which drivers of modified passenger cars, trucks or
motorcycles compete on an eighth-mile straightaway.</LD>
<TE>   Irwindale Police Chief Joseph De Ladurantey said Elder had been
sitting a few rows in front of Reyes. The two exchanged words
throughout the night, De Ladurantey said.</TE>
<TE>   When the races ended at 10 p.m., Elder apparently approached Reyes
and a fistfight began. Reyes shot Elder and fired at a group of
people walking past the grandstands, wounding a woman and man, both
18, De Ladurantey said.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to flee in a sport utility vehicle with four men who
hadn't been involved in the shooting, De Ladurantey said. They were
being treated as witnesses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The street legal races will continue, said an Irwindale Speedway
spokesman, Doug Stokes, but the racetrack will examine its security
measures.</TE>
<TE>   The events, which typically draw at least 200 cars, started in
March as a collaboration between local police and the Speedway as a
safer alternative to racing on residential streets.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a tragedy for a very positive program," De
Ladurantey said</TE>
<TE>   Illegal street racing has long been a problem in Los Angeles
County, particularly in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Citing safety concerns caused by illegal street racing, the Los
Angeles City Council took emergency action Friday to close a section
of Glenoaks Boulevard in Sun Valley over the next four weekend
nights.</TE>
<TE>   The council authorized blocking traffic between Peoria and Sheldon
Streets from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. on weekends through Sept. 7 to allow
police to develop a permanent plan to combat racing.</TE>

<HD>Simon Vows to Fight On Against Davis</HD>
<DH>Campaign: The Republican candidate for governor is upbeat
in his first public appearance since laying off nearly half his
staff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his first public appearance since laying off nearly half his
campaign staff earlier this week, Republican gubernatorial candidate
Bill Simon Jr. on Friday pledged a strong fight against Gov. Gray
Davis and said he can stand the incumbent's barrage of negative
television ads.</LD>
<LD>   "What I can't stand," Simon told the Rotary Club of Los Angeles,
"is what he's done to the state of California. What I can't stand is
how he mortgaged the office, how he's sold his signature."</LD>
<LD>   Simon lags far behind Davis in fund-raising, allowing the governor
to run televised attack ads since June without the GOP candidate
being able to mount a significant response on the airwaves.</LD>
<TE>   Simon, who is making his first run for office, ran into further
difficulty July 31 when a Los Angeles jury issued a $78-million fraud
verdict against his family-owned investment firm. That verdict has
threatened to undercut Simon's argument that his business background
qualifies him to govern California.</TE>
<TE>   Since that verdict, Davis has collected $1.15 million in the large
contributions that candidates are required to report publicly,
compared to $595,000 for Simon. A prodigious fund-raiser, Davis had
$31.6 million in his campaign treasury at the end of June compared to
$5 million for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a multimillionaire, also contributed money of his own to
his campaign for the first time in months, writing a $6,250 check on
Aug. 6, according to campaign reports. Aides said the check was to
pay a campaign worker's salary.</TE>
<TE>   Simon lent himself $5 million during the GOP primary earlier this
year. He is scheduled to appear at three fund-raisers with President
Bush next week.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to streamline what critics said was a bloated
campaign staff, Simon this week fired about 30 aides--some of whom
had served him since he was a blip in the polls last year.</TE>
<TE>   After his speech Friday, Simon told reporters he had to make the
cuts to stay competitive with Davis, and indicated that he would
begin television advertising soon.</TE>
<TE>   "All we're trying to do is remain in fighting shape for a very
tough campaign," Simon said. "You've always got to manage your
campaign responsibly."</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign seized on the layoffs to buttress its argument
that Simon is an incompetent manager.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy fired half his campaign staff, and you mean to tell me
he's a better leader" than the governor? said Davis spokesman Gabriel
Sanchez. "It speaks to the guy's loyalty too."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's aides were informed Wednesday afternoon and Thursday that
they would be laid off with no severance. But the candidate said many
are volunteering to stay with the campaign until election day. If
Simon wins, the volunteers will receive double their back pay.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are good people," Simon said, "and they did a good
job."</TE>
<TE>   Though some GOP insiders have questioned the viability of Simon's
campaign, the candidate appeared in good spirits Friday. He was in
his element, speaking to a crowd of businesspeople in the conference
center of the new Roman Catholic cathedral in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   There had been reports that Simon was going to give a major speech
on corporate responsibility. Instead, the candidate gave a variant of
his standard stump speech to the crowd, in which he blamed Davis for
the state's budget deficit, energy crisis and failing schools but
offered few specific proposals of his own.</TE>
<TE>   During a question-and-answer period, though, he alluded to the
bruising nature of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "People have said, 'Hey, Bill, when are you going to take the
gloves off? These ads are real burners,' " Simon said. "Well, they
are. I don't like them. But I can stand them."</TE>
<TE>   His voice rising, Simon then accused Davis of giving generous wage
hikes to prison guards after their union contributed to the
governor's campaign, and of allowing a company that has donated to
Davis to dump waste into San Francisco Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "This system is broken, the system that allows Gray Davis to
mortgage his office and take 50 million bucks and spend $16 million
to attack me," Simon said, his face flushed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to get up and respond to him!"</TE>

<HD>Unlikely Sleuths Help Catch Rape Suspect</HD>
<DH>Hancock Park: Police believe man committed multiple
attacks. Jewish volunteers spotted him on street.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quick thinking and clever sleuthing by members of an Orthodox Jewish
group, including two rabbis, led to the arrest Thursday of a man
police suspect is the serial rapist who has attacked elderly women in
Hancock Park and surrounding areas.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles police arrested Gary David Johnson, 41, about 8 p.m.
after they were alerted by members of Hatzolah, a nonprofit group
that is the city's only volunteer emergency medical service.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the year-old organization, which goes by the Hebrew
word for rescue, have become known for being the first to respond to
medical emergencies in the heavily Jewish Mid-Wilshire and Fairfax
districts.</LD>
<TE>   They and others in the neighborhood had been on heightened alert
for days as fliers and composite drawings circulated in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham Matyas, a Hatzolah volunteer, was driving on South Formosa
Avenue about 7:30 p.m. when he noticed a man who matched the
composite drawing of the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw him talking on an intercom at a residence in the 100 block
of South Formosa," Matyas said. "It seemed that something was not
right."</TE>
<TE>   As the man began walking, Matyas followed him in his car. After
the man looked directly at Matyas, the volunteer called two friends,
asking one to pick up the pursuit so the man would not become
suspicious. That friend followed the man to a nail salon in a 3rd
Street mini-mall three blocks west of La Brea Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Matyas switched cars and joined Rabbis Shmuel Manne
and Chaim Kolodny at the mini-mall. They watched the man as he
ordered ice cream, sat on a bus bench and then began walking up
Poinsettia Place, north of 3rd Street. Matyas then left because he
feared he would be recognized by the man.</TE>
<TE>   Manne and Kolodny followed the suspect in their cars and saw him
ring a doorbell. No one answered.</TE>
<TE>   At this time, Kolodny quickly returned to his office at Los
Angeles Cheder day school, where he is director, to pick up a copy of
the police flier that he had gotten from Los Angeles Deputy Chief
David Kalish the day before, because he wanted to make sure the
suspect matched the description.</TE>
<TE>   He had spent much of Thursday scanning the flier into his
computer, distributing it by e-mail and running off 1,000 copies that
were handed out in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Kolodny drove back to the area, where Manne had continued to watch
the suspect. Now feeling confident he had the right man, Kolodny
called police from his cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Several minutes passed, during which Kolodny saw the man go to a
house at Poinsettia and 1st Street. When no one responded, the man
walked south and looked directly at Kolodny before walking on.</TE>
<TE>   Kolodny made a U-turn, and the man "charged toward my truck,"
Kolodny said.</TE>
<TE>   Kolodny drove on and, looking in his rear-view mirror, "saw the
prettiest sight." Police vehicles were descending on the suspect and
"taking him down."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday afternoon, sporting dark suits and yarmulkes and
standing in the mini-mall parking area where their drama had begun
the evening before, Kolodny, 31, and Manne, 34, were basking in the
glow of television and newspaper cameras. They seemed to relish
repeating the tale of how they--the unlikeliest of gumshoes--trailed
a possible rapist.</TE>
<TE>   The rabbis credited a strong relationship with police for the
smooth apprehension.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty much attuned to what's going on in the community,
and neighbor watches out for neighbor," Manne said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel like a hero, but I'm happy for all the bubbies in
the area," Kolodny said, using the Yiddish endearment for
grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   The case was one of three ongoing investigations in the region
involving serial rapists. The others are in Torrance and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, police had announced a $25,000 reward for information
leading to the serial rapist's arrest and conviction. If Johnson is
charged and convicted, Kolodny and Manne will use the reward money to
buy defibrillators for Hatzolah, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Johnson has a criminal record in California,
Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina. In California, he served a
two-year prison term for a Santa Monica burglary, according to the
Department of Corrections. He was paroled in 1995, department
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Kalish called the arrest "the epitome of community policing."</TE>
<TE>   The police had mobilized the community by employing senior lead
officers from area divisions to distribute information at
Neighborhood Watch meetings and senior centers.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said they believe that, since July 27, Johnson
committed four sexual assaults and attempted four others in Hollywood
and the Mid-Wilshire area, bounded by La Cienega Boulevard and June
Street, and Beverly and Olympic boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks typically took place between midafternoon and early
evening. The attacker would knock on a victim's door, engage her in
conversation and urge her to let him inside. In some instances, he
forced his way into residences and sexually assaulted the victims
before taking jewelry and cash.</TE>
<TE>   Some victims refused to let the man in but were attacked after he
entered through an unlocked back or side door, Kalish said.</TE>

<HD>Project to Reinforce Breakwater at Ventura Harbor Nearly
Done</HD>
<DH>Construction: Crews continue 12-hour shifts to strengthen a
100-foot stretch damaged by high seas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Workers by Monday hope to wrap up a $1.2-million federal project to
rebuild a large section of the Ventura Harbor breakwater toppled by
high seas in January.</LD>
<LD>   The worst damage is to a 100-foot area in the middle of the
1,750-foot-long breakwater, said Richard Parsons, dredging program
manager for the Ventura Port District. An area at the south end is
also damaged.</LD>
<LD>   Although last winter was relatively mild, huge waves knocked off
several "armor" stones weighing 12 to 22 tons each and sent them to
the sea floor.</LD>
<TE>   "We've known for a number of years that there was a weak spot,"
Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   The money for reinforcing the breakwater, obtained with the help
of Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), was originally earmarked for
another repair project at the harbor entrance.</TE>
<TE>   The funds were redirected because the reinforcement project was
considered more critical, Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   Contractors under the guidance of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
are using one of the largest marine cranes on the West Coast, mounted
on a barge 255 feet long by 78 feet wide. The crane is capable of
lifting 300 tons--equal to a pallet of 82 sport utility vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Schryver, project manager for Connolly-Pacific Co., a Long
Beach-based marine construction company, said crews of five workers
at a time have been operating the crane 12 hours a day, seven days a
week since the project started Aug. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Workers were required to dismantle the entire section of
breakwater, which rises about 18 feet above the water, and rebuild it
from the floor up to correct the weaknesses, Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very tedious project. You've got to handle those stones
and move them individually," Schryver said. "It is somewhat of a
science and somewhat of an art."</TE>
<TE>   Aided by low swells, the project is running on schedule, Schryver
said. The harbor remains open.</TE>
<TE>   The breakwater was built in 1970 at a cost of $3 million,
primarily to trap sand moving down the coast so that it doesn't block
the channel, Parsons said. The south end of the breakwater also
shelters the harbor entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Gaps between the rocks absorb energy from pounding waves, some as
high as 22 feet, so that the breakwater can withstand storms.</TE>
<TE>   The breakwater required no repairs during its first 15 years,
Parsons said, but more extreme weather conditions have necessitated
several restoration projects since the mid-1980s. About $1 million
was spent to repair the north end of the breakwater for similar
structural problems early in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be in good shape after these repairs, and hopefully it
won't have to happen again in the near future," Parsons said.</TE>

<HD>Ruling May Kill Detention Camp</HD>
<DH>Courts: Orange County might have to return grant if it
can't finish Trabuco Canyon facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge on Friday threw out Orange County's plans to expand a Trabuco
Canyon detention center for youthful offenders, dealing the project
what county officials said could be a fatal blow.</LD>
<LD>   The county must complete the $18-million facility by the end of
2003 or lose an $8.4-million state grant. Officials doubt they can
make the deadline.</LD>
<LD>   If the judge's ruling stands, "we are going to have to give back
the grant money," said Thomas G. Wright, the county's chief deputy
probation officer. "We won't be able to build it."</LD>
<TE>   To ease overcrowding at youth detention facilities, the county
wants to build the 90-bed Rancho Potrero Leadership Academy on
property adjacent to the existing 64-bed Joplin Youth Center.</TE>
<TE>   Residents who live around the Trabuco Canyon site strongly oppose
the project, fearing it would increase traffic and harm the rustic
surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors last year approved an environmental impact report for
the leadership academy, which would house youths accused of low-level
crimes who officials believe could benefit from a rural setting.
Residents then filed suit.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Superior Court Judge Lisa Guy-Schall ruled Friday that
the environmental impact report was inadequate because the project
was not in keeping with planning regulations for the area. The case
had been transferred to neutral San Diego County's jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a beautiful area to preserve, and there are laws in place
to preserve it," said Richard Gomez, a spokesman for the Saddleback
Canyons Conservancy, which filed the lawsuit along with the Rural
Canyons Conservation Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy because the integrity of an area protected by law is
maintained," Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents included among their court filings photos obtained by a
remote-controlled model airplane with a 35-millimeter camera strapped
to it. The photos showed what residents said was illegal grading done
by the county without proper permits.</TE>
<TE>   The county argued the grading was for maintenance at Joplin and
unrelated to the academy project. But the judge rejected that claim,
finding that maintenance and construction projects were
"significantly similar."</TE>
<TE>   County officials said they will meet early next week with their
attorney to decide the next move.</TE>
<TE>   Wright said the county could return to the planning stage, but
that would mean months in delays.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have to build the academy in less than a year, and that
can't be done," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   County officials said there is a strong need for more beds at
juvenile detention facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Probation Department estimates that it will require nearly 300
additional "nonsecure" beds like those at Joplin by 2005 and about
200 additional "secure" beds like those at Juvenile Hall in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   If the Joplin expansion is scrapped, "we might be faced with
finding another way to make more beds," Wright said.</TE>

<LD>Laguna Beach, one of the cities in Southern California most prone to
sewage spills, will receive a major grant from the federal government
Monday to help implement its recently proclaimed "zero tolerance"
policy toward spills.</LD>
<LD>   "It's critically important," Mayor Wayne Baglin said of the
$873,000 check that will be handed to him by a representative of the
Environmental Protection Agency during a 1:30 p.m. ceremony in a
gazebo overlooking the ocean. "The money will be used to repair 40
different deficiencies we've located within the system--this is a
start."</LD>
<LD>   The funds--which the city will add to for a total of $1.6
million--were written into the federal budget by Rep. Christopher Cox
(R-Newport Beach) after a 2001 study ranked Laguna Beach as
second-worst among 30 California cities graded for sewage spills. The
only city experiencing more than Laguna's 18 spills that year, EPA
spokesman Mark Merchant said, was Avalon on Catalina Island.</LD>
<TE>   "We attribute [Laguna Beach's spills] primarily to roots and
grease," Merchant said. "It's the capacity of their system, some of
which dates back to the 1930s. Newer cities can handle that material,
but Laguna is old enough so that it can't."</TE>
<TE>   The city got a wake-up call two years ago, Baglin said, when it
was fined $60,000 by the regional water quality board for numerous
spills and beach closures during the previous 18 months. "The
citizens began asking what we were doing paying a fine," the mayor
said. " 'Shouldn't the money be spent on improving the sewer system?'
"</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Baglin said, Laguna Beach began documenting
sewer-system problems, eventually adopting a plan for spending $25
million to $35 million over 20 years. Monday's grant, Baglin said,
will start that plan by funding repair of the 40 most critical
deficiencies within the 90-mile system'.</TE>
<TE>   Extensive videotaping of the system completed last year "found
collapsed lines, bad connections, fence posts driven through sewer
lines and roots in the main lines," Baglin said. "All of these things
are certainly the first stages of sewer spills about to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The city hopes to pay for the rest of the upgrades and repairs, he
said, through a combination of grants, low-interest loans from the
state and income derived from municipal sewer fees.</TE>
<TE>   "First we're going after known problem areas," Baglin said, "then
we will be attacking each problem sequentially to keep sewer spills
from happening."</TE>

<HD>Unlikely Alliance Backs Mexican Grocery Store</HD>
<DH>Business: Groups that are often at odds urge Anaheim to
approve Gigante's liquor license.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Political activists who generally land on opposing sides of every
issue found themselves in the same camp Friday, urging the Anaheim
City Council to grant a liquor license to Gigante market and
denouncing city opposition as biased and unwarranted.</LD>
<LD>   The city Planning Commission's denial of the Mexican supermarket
chain's application "is absolutely inappropriate and smacks of racism
and racial profiling," said Nativo Lopez, co-director of Hermandad
Mexicana Nacional, an organization that assists Spanish-speaking
immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   "I might not use those same words [but] I share the same
sentiment," said Curt Pringle, a former Republican speaker of the
state Assembly and one of five candidates for mayor in November.</LD>
<TE>   The council will be asked Tuesday to overturn the Planning
Commission's action, which store officials said would kill its
chances for profitability. Gigante wants to open its first Orange
County market at Anaheim Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Pringle said he was drawn to Gigante's side because government
should not be telling businesses where and how to operate. "This
issue has united individuals and organizations with diverse
viewpoints around the basic American principle of property rights
[and] fairness," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said the city is attempting social engineering and creating
invalid reasons to deny the license.</TE>
<TE>   In an Oct. 23 letter, Elisa Stipkovich, executive director of the
city's redevelopment agency, said city staffers wanted a different
store in Anaheim Plaza, one that would attract a "wider demographic"
base of customers. Last month, planning commissioners said the
high-crime area is saturated with stores selling alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers urging the city to welcome Gigante were Amin David
of Los Amigos of Orange County; John Palacio of the League of United
Latin American Citizens; Rick Eiden, director of organizing for the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 324.</TE>

<HD>Despite Warnings, Davis Took No Action Against Metabolife</HD>
<DH>Health: Governor says donations from the weight-loss
company were not a factor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>After accepting $150,000 in political contributions from a California
weight-loss company two years ago, Gov. Gray Davis decided the state
would await federal action and not advise the public of the possible
ill effects of the company's widely marketed herbal diet pills.</LD>
<LD>   Now with the federal government opening a criminal investigation
into whether San Diego-based Metabolife International Inc. has
covered up thousands of adverse consumer reactions to its product,
Davis on Friday said he likely will sign legislation that bans the
sale of the products to minors. His administration also sent a letter
to federal regulators demanding that they take action to investigate
complaints.</LD>
<LD>   "We have given them a couple of years," Davis said of the federal
government. "If they don't tell us within 30 days that they're going
to do it, we're going to do it."</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, scientists, including some in Davis' own Department
of Health Services, strongly urged that the product be banned, citing
concerns that its chief ingredients--herbal ephedrine and
caffeine--caused heart attacks, strokes and seizures.</TE>
<TE>   But the governor, who had received three separate donations
totaling $150,000 from Metabolife, vetoed legislation--already
weakened by the industry's lobbying--that would have required a
warning label on such products marketed in California. In his veto
message, Davis declared that regulation of such products should be
left to the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The governor says there is no connection between Metabolife's
political contributions, which have since reached $175,000, and his
stance on the legislation. And both he and a spokesman for Metabolife
co-founder Michael J. Ellis say the basis of their political
relationship is a shared interest in education; they have never
discussed Metabolife's products or the issue of regulation, their
spokesmen say.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can say," the governor noted, "is that there is not a donor
to me that has not seen a couple of bills vetoed that he very much
wanted signed."</TE>
<TE>   The decision two years ago to cede power to the federal government
was an unusual position for any California governor, particularly
Davis, who has often stepped in when the federal government was slow
to act. At the time, federal regulatory efforts had stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Davis made no effort to encourage federal action until Friday,
when his health director fired off a missive to the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration urging that it take "swift action on this
important public health issue."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation Davis is contemplating signing would ban sales to
minors, require that marketers of the products in California provide
a warning label, and require that companies include an 800 number to
the FDA that consumers could call with any adverse health effects.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) said she would welcome the
governor's signature on her legislation, SB 1750, calling it "the
very least that we should do." Similar legislation stalled last year,
in part, she has said, because the administration did not help push
for it.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has more than 100 reports of deaths possibly associated
with ephedra, although experts familiar with the data say records are
incomplete and the actual number of attributable deaths could be no
more than a dozen. The use of ephedrine compounds made headlines last
year when two college football players, Florida State linebacker
DeVaughn Darling and Northwestern safety Rashidi Wheeler, died during
off-season workouts with the NCAA-banned supplement in their systems.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department disclosed it had opened
an investigation into claims by Ellis in a 1998 letter to the FDA
that the company "has never received one notice from a consumer that
any serious adverse health event has occurred because ingestion of
Metabolife 356."</TE>
<TE>   In response, the company announced it would immediately and
voluntarily release records of more than 13,000 health complaints the
company has received from customers of the product since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Industry representatives insist the substance is safe, so long as
consumers follow manufacturers' warnings.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were killing people, we would have been put out of
business," Metabolife lawyer Garry P. Mauro said, adding that obesity
is a far more serious public health threat than anything his client
sells.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Metabolife was founded in 1995 by Ellis, then a 42-year-old former
police officer and real estate agent, who five years earlier had
struck a deal with prosecutors to avoid prison on drug charges.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Ellis and longtime friend Michael L. Blevins were
indicted on federal charges stemming from an undercover operation
against methamphetamine labs in San Diego County. Court papers say
Ellis leased a home in the exclusive Rancho Santa Fe area north of
San Diego where a meth lab was set up.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment alleged conspiring to manufacture methamphetamine
with intent to distribute it. But documents say Ellis cooperated
extensively with authorities by making undercover buys from other
dealers, and he pleaded guilty in 1990 to a lesser charge of using a
telephone to facilitate drug trafficking. He was still on probation
in 1992 when he started a dietary-supplement business that grew into
Metabolife International.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokeswoman Jan Strode described the crime as a "mistake
by Mr. Ellis many years ago," and called it "totally irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   Blevins helped prosecutors too but received stiffer penalties.
Federal authorities, believing Blevins had been dealing drugs since
the 1970s, won court orders to seize $1.3 million in assets. He
served 4 1/2 years in federal prison, then received a judge's
permission in 1995 to join Ellis in the dietary supplement venture.</TE>
<TE>   Ephedra, which is the herbal twin of a synthetic compound used to
make illegal methamphetamine, has been wildly successful for the
company--and for Ellis. In a 1999 court document, Ellis' ex-wife
estimated his income at $250,000 a month. She said he paid cash for a
200-acre ranch near Julian, as well as a home with five baths, a pool
and a four-car garage in the Fairbanks Ranch enclave, not far from
the Rancho Santa Fe house that he leased in the late 1980s and that
was a target of the meth sting.</TE>
<TE>   As a privately held company, Metabolife's sales figures aren't
public, but it touts itself as the leader in a niche of the industry
that the Legislature says has annual sales of $200 million in
California alone.</TE>
<TE>   As its fortunes grew, Metabolife began donating to charities--more
than $1 million a year by 1999, mostly to causes benefiting children
in the San Diego area, where the company is headquartered. Through
his personal foundation, Ellis has donated $1 million to his hometown
Chula Vista schools, according to a local superintendent's estimate,
and he has guaranteed that all students in the graduating class of
2006 who have the grades but not the money can attend San Diego State
University.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike is visionary," said Sweetwater Union High School District
Supt. Edward Brand. "He sees that unless we fix the gap between the
haves and have-nots, the country is going to be in for some rough
times. He believes that education is the key to doing that."</TE>
<TE>   The company and its executives also donate to political
candidates. Records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics in
Washington show Metabolife and people affiliated with it contributed
$1.41 million to federal campaigns between 1999 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Metabolife gives to Democrats and Republicans. It has helped state
candidates and federal candidates around the country, frequently
those with some connection to the government's regulatory machinery.</TE>
<TE>   It was against this backdrop of growing political influence that
Metabolife first heard from Davis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In early 2000, one of Davis' paid campaign fund-raisers telephoned
Mauro, the Metabolife lawyer and Democratic political consultant, and
solicited a contribution.</TE>
<TE>   As Mauro recalls it, he advised Ellis to donate. "I don't know any
business we've got in Sacramento," he remembers telling his client,
"but you might someday."</TE>
<TE>   Ellis was eager to meet the governor, Mauro said. So Metabolife
hosted a fund-raiser for Davis in February 2000 at the Four Seasons
Hotel in Austin, Texas. The company contributed $50,000 then,
followed by another $50,000 in March.</TE>
<TE>   As he generally does at such events, Davis met privately with the
sponsors--Ellis and other Metabolife executives. And as he often
does, recalls Mauro, the governor talked about public schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we mentioned herbal supplements," Mauro said. "I
can tell you they talked about education, education and more
education."</TE>
<TE>   In Mauro's view, however, such conversations do not need to be
directly on-point to be effective.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind," he said, "politics and business are a lot alike. Who
do you do business with? People you have personal relationships with.
Who do you do politics with? People you have personal relationships
with. So the time to become friends with a politician is not when you
need to ask him for something."</TE>
<TE>   That "someday" that Mauro cautioned Ellis to consider arrived the
same week as the fund-raiser. Then-Assemblywoman Susan Davis, a San
Diego Democrat who is no relation to the governor, introduced
legislation to toughen warning levels on Metabolife 356 and other
ephedrine products.</TE>
<TE>   "Exceeding recommended serving may cause serious adverse health
effects, including heart attack and stroke," the proposed label said.
The legislation also required that labels include a toll-free number,
so consumers suffering ill effects could report them to the
California Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Her effort was the latest round in several years of government
attempts to regulate the substance.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had tried without success to
restrict ephedrine-based products since 1997, when it proposed
cutting the allowable dose of herbal ephedrine in dietary supplements
to eight milligrams per pill, one-third of the amount in many
products. That same year, the Food and Drug Branch of the California
Department of Health urged the FDA to go even further. California
scientists advocated allowing no more than one milligram of ephedra
per pill.</TE>
<TE>   The state also called for a prohibition on spiking the products
with caffeine, as Metabolife 356 does, and it proposed a warning
label with direct language: "Taking more than the recommended serving
may cause heart attack, stroke, seizure or death."</TE>
<TE>   Ellis and a representative of a dietary-supplement trade
association traveled to Sacramento in October 1997 to confer with
Food and Drug Branch scientists. According to a memo prepared by
scientists after the meeting, Ellis' associate advocated for the
right to sell pills containing up to 30 milligrams of ephedra--nearly
four times the federal proposal and 30 times the state's
recommendation--with a daily maximum of 150 milligrams.</TE>
<TE>   The following April, Rosanna Porras, a 15-year-old girl from
Fillmore, in Ventura County, took two to four pills of an energy
booster containing ephedrine (but not manufactured by Metabolife) and
collapsed while playing soccer. She died three days later. Her death
was blamed on a congenital heart defect. Still, there was intense
interest in the possible connection between her death and ephedrine,
both publicly and within the Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it time for the [Food and Drug Branch] to do something?"
department toxicologist Susan Loscutoff wrote to her colleagues in an
April 21, 1998, e-mail obtained by The Times under the California
Public Records Act. "If not [as an] unapproved food additive," she
continued, "then [as an] adulterated or controlled substance?"</TE>
<TE>   Jim Waddell, head of the Food and Drug Branch, replied: "I agree
with Susan. Perhaps action is needed."</TE>
<TE>   No action was taken, however, and by the time Assemblywoman Davis
introduced her warning-label legislation in February 2000, some of
the early momentum had stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Metabolife's lobbyist attended hearings and meetings on the bill,
but the trade group, the American Herbal Products Assn., of which
Metabolife is a member, took the lead in lobbying against it. By
August, the legislation had been weakened considerably.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed warning no longer mentioned heart attack or stroke.
And rather than require a phone number linked to the Department of
Health Services, the bill said the toll-free number would be linked
to the industry--and companies could omit the identities of consumers
in any adverse-effect reports they turned over to the state.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Legislature approved the final bill, in August
2000, the industry no longer opposed it. On Sept. 29, 2000, Davis
vetoed the watered-down warning label legislation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The veto came as a relief to some health experts. One said the
final version was worse than nothing. But the governor's reasoning
also troubled them.</TE>
<TE>   "While regulation and labeling of dietary supplements containing
ephedrine would seem prudent and in the interest of public safety,"
Davis said, "this is a matter of interstate commerce, and clearly the
responsibility of Congress to regulate, which they have thus far
neglected to do."</TE>
<TE>   By concluding that the issue was the federal government's
responsibility, said those who want to regulate ephedrine, Davis
seemed to be declaring that California would assert no jurisdiction
over dietary supplements out of deference to federal authority. It
was a curious position, given Davis' past.</TE>
<TE>   Under Davis and his predecessors, California has used state law to
regulate substances it deems dangerous. Earlier this year, state
health scientists concluded an "herbal" prostate cancer remedy was
unsafe. The Department of Health Services issued a public warning and
persuaded the manufacturer to recall it. Last month, Davis signed
first-in-the-nation legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions
from automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   Past administrations have similarly asserted the state's autonomy.
Republican Gov. Wilson signed legislation banning smoking in
restaurants. And using its own authority, Wilson's Department of
Health Services in 1997 placed warnings unique to California on
dieters' tea after the product was linked to 11 deaths and 67
illnesses nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   In light of that record, some people said Davis' inaction on
ephedrine was inexcusable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a cop-out," said James P. Frantz, a San Diego attorney who
has sued marketers of herbal ephedrine on behalf of consumers who
have suffered or died after taking the products. "The state of
California, if it wanted to do something to protect the consumer,
would. The state doesn't need the federal government to step in."</TE>

<HD>MTA Wants 100 More Rapid Buses for Wilshire Route</HD>
<DH>Transit: The agency's board approves a $232-million plan to
buy the popular vehicles and to test a buses-only lane on a clogged
part of the boulevard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transit officials pushed forward a plan this week to buy more Rapid
Buses for the popular Wilshire Boulevard route, and convert a traffic
lane to a buses-only lane as a test case.</LD>
<LD>   The $232-million plan approved by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority board calls for the replacement of the current Wilshire
fleet with about 100 of the new Rapid Buses within three years. It
would increase total capacity by about 30%.</LD>
<LD>   The Rapid Bus line on Wilshire, the MTA's busiest line just two
years after its inception, extends 26 miles from Santa Monica to
Montebello and is designed to reduce trip times by about 25%.</LD>
<TE>   Also used on Ventura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley, Rapid
Buses have special sensors that extend green traffic signals and low
floors for faster boarding. Drivers are not held to a schedule but
are told to drive the route as fast as they safely and legally can.
The popular buses are full during rush hours, and many riders must
stand.</TE>
<TE>   The buses the MTA now wants to buy will have two cabins instead of
one and will hold 60 passengers rather than the current 40. The
cabins would be connected together by a flexible, accordion-like
section. The MTA, which is looking for a manufacturer to make the
buses, wants its new fleet to be environmentally friendly, electric
powered and quieter than current vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from purchasing the new buses, the MTA plan calls for
repaving parts of Wilshire, making streets flatter and smoother, and
for expanding the size of bus stops.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA will also, for the first time, designate a bus-only lane
on a one-mile section of the route near the San Diego Freeway on Los
Angeles' west side. That lane will be for buses only during peak
periods and will be used as a test case.</TE>
<TE>   The lane will be watched closely by the MTA, which hopes to add
rush hour, bus-only lanes throughout Wilshire. The agency is eager to
see how such lanes affect parking, and hopes to figure out how to
keep cars from encroaching on the lanes and get a better sense of how
such lanes may speed travel.</TE>
<TE>   "Our most recent studies show that if, during rush hours, you
don't have the bottlenecks ... we can attract a lot more people to
transit," said MTA planner David Mieger, referring to the bus lane.</TE>
<TE>   Resident and business groups along Wilshire have clashed with the
MTA in the past several years over plans floated by the agency to
create bus lanes separated by curbs from other traffic, with the
lanes possibly running down the middle of Wilshire. Some worry that a
permanent, fixed lane would lead to more car traffic and hurt
businesses by taking away street parking.</TE>
<TE>   Planners at the agency have long said that such a design would
allow for optimum speeds and do the most to alleviate congestion.
Mieger said that for the time being, given the negative reaction from
the public, MTA planners have put such plans aside. Solving the
Wilshire traffic puzzle is one of the transit agency's highest
priorities. Wilshire is one of the most congested corridors in the
nation. MTA buses are relied on heavily, providing rides for about
40,000 people each day.</TE>

<HD>City of Paramount, Call Paramount Pictures With Those
Municipal Dramas</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With TV's obsession for reality shows, I'm surprised none of the
networks have thought of dramatizing the city of Paramount's monthly
newsletter. What a hit it could be, chock-full of colorful items such
as this: "A local beauty salon owner came in to complain that another
salon owner was stealing her styles. Apparently she came to the
Planning counter after she'd visited the Sheriff's station and was
unsuccessful in filing a theft report."</LD>
<LD>   Language! Gordon Shaffer of Yorba Linda noticed that someone
applied the brakes too early to a brake shop's banner, with rather
disastrous results (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   Which reminds me: The news that Chairman Robert Brooks of Hooters
restaurants may buy bankrupt Vanguard Airlines Inc. inspired KNX
commentator Dave Ross to speculate--or should I say fantasize?--about
the outfits that would be worn by stewardesses on a Hooters-owned
airline. The life-vest instructions, he figured, would be closely
watched by at least half the passengers. And he wondered whether this
would be the first airline to invite meal tips.</LD>
<TE>   Parking is such street sorrow: I've rarely seen such a battle of
dueling arrows and signs as the one Phil Proctor spotted (but did not
park near) in West Hollywood (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Unauthorized autobiography: Sports anchor Bill Weir, who is
leaving KABC-TV, told the media Web site www.ronfineman.com that one
of the reasons he was disenchanted was an incident involving a
tongue-in-cheek bio he wrote for Channel 7's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The bio said that, in addition to handling sports, Weir also did
"yardwork around the station on weekends." It continued: "Bill was
orphaned at a young age and raised by a family of squirrels." And
Weir wrote that his first career break was a job in Austin, Minn.,
"renowned as the birthplace of Spam."</TE>
<TE>   But Channel 7 expunged that bio and replaced with it with a
serious one as exciting as Spam.</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: Raul Roa saw an ad for an odd type of gift at
one eatery (see photo). Surprised by the spelling, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   Remembering Chick: The death of broadcaster Chick Hearn has
prompted the L.A. Press Club to postpone the All Media Bowl-a-Thon,
which Hearn was to emcee. An award named for Hearn will be presented.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, Hearn presided over a local TV game show called
"Bowling for Dollars." Like the host of the current "Weakest Link"
show, Hearn sometimes played the role of caustic commentator for
humorous effect. A contestant once told Hearn that her goal was to
win enough money to go to Las Vegas. But she rolled two gutter balls,
whereupon he wisecracked that she wasn't "even going to Pomona." Yet
Hearn delivered the jests in such a way that the contestants laughed
along too.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: To mark the 25th anniversary of Elvis Presley's
retreat from view, Wickes Furniture unveiled a line of furniture in
his name. But columnist David Allen of the Inland Valley Bulletin was
puzzled that the Elvis Presley Collection is limited to bedroom sets.
"An Elvis kitchen," he pointed out, "could have a double-wide
refrigerator and oven perfect for making a hunka-hunka burning pot
roast."</TE>

<HD>Hikers' Dream of Complete Trail Is Closer to Reality</HD>
<DH>One of the last links in the Backbone, which runs from
Point Mugu to Pacific Palisades, will be dedicated Thursday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some feet were tired. Others were sore. A few had blisters after days
of pounding the hot, dusty trail in the Santa Monica Mountains. Yet
the sight of the air-conditioned passenger vans, which showed up to
whisk the hikers across an impassible stretch during their seven-day
trek, did not come as a relief. Instead, the sentiment was closer to
disappointment.</LD>
<LD>   As the 31 hikers boarded the vans, they felt deprived of the cool
ocean breezes that swept up long canyons, carrying the aroma of sage
and purple lupine. They felt cheated out of the sensory treats that
every bend in the trail can bring, whether it's a glimpse of a coyote
skulking in the brush or a whale spouting in the ocean below.</LD>
<LD>   The hikers looked forward to the day when a motorized detour won't
be necessary, when it will be possible to walk the entire 60-mile
Backbone Trail.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the point of the hike, which many in the group have taken
for three years in a row, was to nudge public officials to fill in
the last remaining gaps of the Backbone Trail and create an
uninterrupted footpath from Point Mugu State Park in Ventura County
to Will Rogers State Park in the Pacific Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been nice to be able to hike the whole way," said
Gail Hanna, a U.S. Navy retiree and veteran of many long hikes along
the coast of California. Without the need of motorized vehicles, she
said, "it would be a dream of a walk."</TE>
<TE>   The reality is nearly at hand. Four miles of the 5.5-mile gap will
be connected in coming weeks, as work crews put the finishing touches
on a stretch of mountainous trail with commanding views of the
Pacific Ocean and the Channel Islands. A dedication ceremony is set
for Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) has secured federal funds to
buy easements or property to close the final 1.5-mile gap. "This has
been a 25-to 30-year process,'' Sherman said. "We're nearly there.''</TE>
<TE>   National Park Service officials are now in "delicate
negotiations'' to buy the final five parcels, or purchase public
rights of way, said Woody Smeck, acting superintendent of the Santa
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.</TE>
<TE>   "There is actually a footpath through the area, but it's not legal
or sanctioned," Smeck said. "After buying hundreds of parcels, it's
come down to the last five. I'm hopeful that, in the next 12 months,
we can either close on these ... or find alternatives around them."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most persistent voices prodding the government have
come from the 31 men and women who turn out each year to walk as much
of the Backbone Trail as can be walked.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-day expedition was led by a Backbone Trail advocate and
guidebook author, Milt McAuley. At 83, McAuley knows as much about
these mountains as anyone. "This needs to be a substantial trail,"
McAuley said. "We are here to prove it's worthwhile."</TE>
<TE>   Walking resolutely with a staff of a dried yucca stalk, the
weathered McAuley looked every bit the mountain patriarch, with bushy
white mustache and wild eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important," he said, "to push on." It's especially important
to McAuley, who is determined to walk the length of a completed
Backbone Trail before his legs give out.</TE>
<TE>   But as the group of mostly retirees threaded through the
chaparral, past sun-baked sandstone outcroppings and into glens of
oak and sycamore, their sense of political purpose gave way to
delight.</TE>
<TE>   They smelled the monkey flowers. They tasted the sour and sticky
seeds of the lemonade berry bush. They rubbed sage between their
hands to unleash a burst of fragrance. Half of them, at one point,
dropped to their hands and knees to scrutinize a tiny, delicate
flower through a jeweler's eyepiece that was passed around. Two women
broke into a German hiking song that they had learned growing up in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "You come up here and you are on top of the world," said one of
the women, Franziska Jeffreys, a 66-year-old retired cafeteria worker
from Port Hueneme. Jeffreys extended her arms skyward in an exultant
salute. "When I'm 85, I may go on a cruise somewhere. But until then,
you are going to find me here, sleeping on the ground and chasing
rattlesnakes."</TE>
<TE>   Each hiker paid $50 a day for drinks, hors d'oeuvres and three
meals a day. Their tents and other heavy gear--along with the
food--were trucked in to meet them nightly where roads reach the
trail. The event was cosponsored by the Santa Monica Mountains Trails
Council and Coastwalk, a nonprofit group pushing to complete the
California Coastal Trail from Mexico to Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike more garrulous hikers, Dan Alper, 60, of Santa Cruz kept to
himself, avoiding the chatter, the jokes and the laughter. For him,
the walk was a contemplative one, a time to reflect on and take in
the beauty of nature. Early in the hike, he found himself growing
depressed and even angry at the roads that intruded into the
wilderness and at the houses that seemed out of place, scarring the
hillsides with wide perimeters cleared around them for fire
protection.</TE>
<TE>   "How could government allow this in such a beautiful area?" Alper
asked. "In Santa Cruz, the houses are in the cities and the mountains
are left alone."</TE>
<TE>   But as the group moved from remote Ventura County down the coast
toward Los Angeles, his thinking began to shift. On the last day, the
trail came around a bend and opened up to the towers of Century City
in the foreground, the high rises in downtown Los Angeles farther
away, the sprawling metropolis of 14 million people extending to the
horizon.</TE>
<TE>   "What this is, is a big, urban park," Alper said. "I guess we are
fortunate that big chunks of land have been set aside for us."</TE>

<HD>Thieves,Vandals Chipping Away at Hard-Pressed National
Parks</HD>
<DH>Attractions: Short of money and manpower, treasured areas
from Death Valley to Florida are vulnerable to abuse by visitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEATH VALLEY</DL>
<LD>Under the shady cliffs beside a spring at the bottom of a canyon in
the Grapevine Mountains, Shoshone Indians once sought respite from
Death Valley's wilting heat and marked their passing by etching
images on a room-size slab of granite.</LD>
<LD>   One symbol depicts a bighorn sheep, one a snake, but the rest are
difficult to discern, lost to erosion and a blur of modern graffiti
including a smiley face, crosses and scribbled initials. A nearby
sign warns visitors not to deface the petroglyphs, but people do
anyway. Death Valley National Park may be one of the most protected
landscapes in the nation, but vandalism and theft of cultural and
natural resources are common.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hard to believe people would deface them," said Linda
Greene, chief of resources management for the park, rubbing the
rough-hewn rock carvings. "It illustrates an early way of life, like
a page of history. Rock art is, in many cases, art, so this is like
slicing through a painting when it's defaced."</LD>
<TE>   Loss is not limited to one canyon. Two men were recently arrested
for pilfering ancient Indian baskets and tools on the valley's salt
pan. In Copper Canyon, thieves removed blocks of stone containing
fossilized footprints. At Devil's Hole, revelers tossed beer cans and
debris into a limestone pond where the desert pupfish is on the brink
of extinction.</TE>
<TE>   And near Warm Spring, shooters blast away at mine shafts and
historic buildings. A ranger chased away a paramilitary group only to
return the next day to find vandals had toppled part of an ore
crusher used by gold miners in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   The damage to Death Valley is by no means unique. A shortage of
money and personnel have helped make national parks and monuments
across the country vulnerable to thieves and vandals.</TE>
<TE>   Poachers in California, Texas and Florida have been stripping
Joshua Tree, Big Bend and Everglades national parks of snakes and
lizards and selling them to pet shops and collectors.</TE>
<TE>   At California's Mojave National Preserve, rangers broke up a theft
ring two years ago that had stolen about 10,000 barrel cacti, which
store liquid that wildlife rely on to survive during dry seasons. The
thieves sold the cacti to candy makers in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "About the only thing people don't steal from the parks is the
air. Everything they can get their hands on, they take," said Park
Service special agent Todd Swain.</TE>
<TE>   At Redwood National Park north of Eureka, Calif., nearly 200
incidents of vandalism, arson, theft and burglary were recorded
between 1997 and 1999, costing the Park Service $194,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The national parks are as American as mom and apple pie. These
are the best of the best, enduring symbols of national unity and
pride," said Jennifer S. Coken, national campaign director for the
National Parks Conservation Assn. "Yet we have artifacts, wildlife,
cultural resources and buildings being lost. We've assumed they are
being taken care of, but they are not."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign that Coken is directing has brought together 200
conservation organizations in an effort to secure more financial
backing for the parks from Congress and the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Working with the Park Service, the conservation association has
enlisted graduate students at business schools to survey conditions
at some of the 385 monuments, parks, preserves and historical sites.
The students concluded that the Park Service's annual operating
budget falls short by at least $600 million, or 32%, of what it needs
to operate effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for resource management and educational and interpretive
services is 40% of the amount needed, the group concluded. Some of
the most popular parks, including Yellowstone in Wyoming and Acadia
in Maine, are receiving only 30% to 50% of the money needed, the
survey found.</TE>
<TE>   During a campaign stop two years ago near Seattle, then-candidate
George W. Bush lamented the woeful condition of the national parks,
saying they were "in worse shape than ever before" and "at the
breaking point."</TE>
<TE>   Bush cited sewage flows in lakes at Yellowstone, rain leaking
through roofs onto Civil War relics, and Anasazi stone structures
collapsing at Chaco Cultural National Historical Park in New Mexico.
He pledged to erase a $5-billion backlog of maintenance projects.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, Bush's proposed maintenance budgets for the Park
Service haven't done much to close the gap. The national parks got an
additional $61 million this year, and the president has asked for $2
million on top of that next year.</TE>
<TE>   Members of both parties in Congress are urging more. Americans for
National Parks is advocating an additional $280 million for the Park
Service's budget in the coming fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has made some promises, but the National Park
Service came in under budget," said Republican Sen. Larry Craig of
Idaho, a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "We
have dramatically underfunded the Park Service. I'm frustrated. We
create these new parks and acreage without providing more money for
them," Craig said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, nonprofit groups are paying for more and more basic
services at national parks. The Yosemite Fund is paying to restore
trails at Yosemite National Park. The Yellowstone Park Foundation
helps pay for research on gray wolves and is trying to raise $15
million to pay for a new visitor center at Old Faithful. In Colorado,
the Anheuser-Busch Co. has funded cleanup crews in Rocky Mountain
National Park.</TE>
<TE>   But those private efforts have not kept pace with needs. More
people, from the United States and abroad, continue to visit the
parks, and Congress continues to add more parkland. About 285 million
people visited the parks last year, an increase of 37% over the last
23 years. Total park acreage has more than doubled in that time,
according to the Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   Yet today, staffing at national parks is at its lowest level ever
relative to the size of the territory and the number of visitors
rangers must supervise, said Ken Mabery, president of the Assn. of
National Park Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   "Rangers are spending less time in the field so they can do things
like fill out paperwork for habitat restoration, prescribed burns,
restroom construction and consultation with other agencies," Mabery
said. "People don't see rangers anymore. We're not out there to work
with parks visitors anymore."</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Mabery said, one in four rangers are on homeland
security detail, guarding dams, the Statue of Liberty and the Liberty
Bell, among other things, while others have been pressed into fire
prevention duty as blazes scorch the West.</TE>
<TE>   At the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, more than
1,000 archeological sites have not yet been examined by scientists.</TE>
<TE>   At Lassen National Park north of Sacramento, just 5% of the park
has been surveyed for archeological resources. "There's a lot of
history we are not learning because these sites aren't being
surveyed," Coken said.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Canyon National Park is one of the world's geological
wonders, yet it does not have a geologist on its staff.</TE>
<TE>   Rosie the Riveter World War II National Home Front Historical Park
was created in Richmond, Calif., two years ago to preserve a shipyard
and tell people about the 6 million women who worked in defense
industries during the war.</TE>
<TE>   But there is still no money for a visitor center, exhibits or
tours.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Death Valley, two or three rangers are typically on duty,
patrolling a 3.3-million acre park--nearly as big as
Connecticut--most of which is accessible only by four-wheel-drive
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really have the time or staff or resources to fully
protect these sites," said ranger Kyle Nelson, peering at eroded and
vandalized petroglyphs from beneath his Smokey Bear hat.</TE>
<TE>   Campers dismantle wood structures at historic mining camps for
firewood. Even ore carts, heavy gears and rock crushers, made of iron
and steel, disappear. On a recent inspection of the Queen of Sheba
mine, rangers patched up bullet holes in the building that once
housed miners. The Park Service wants to station someone there to
watch over it, but does not have the funds.</TE>
<TE>   "They take bits and pieces and pick away at the fabric of these
structures. They are just gradually being ripped apart. This is the
mentality we're dealing with," said Greene, the park's chief of
resource management, as she stooped to pick up an empty rum bottle
and a beer can.</TE>
<TE>   One visitor remarked in a log book at the site that he had seen
worse. "Hallelujah!" wrote Sam from Salt Lake City. "A beautiful
place in the middle of nowhere that hadn't been vandalized."</TE>

<LD>A Ventura bookkeeper has been sentenced to four years in state prison
for embezzling $191,000 from her employer, authorities said Thursday.
Katherine A. Bordeaux, 38, pleaded guilty last month to grand theft,
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Howard Wise.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Edward Brodie ordered Bordeaux
to repay $190,998 to her employer, Intercontinental Realty in
Ventura, and $16,884 to the California Franchise Tax Board. She also
will pay $2,900 in fines.</LD>
<LD>   The fraud began in January 1997 when the owner of the real estate
company became sick and Bordeaux took over accounting
responsibilities for a group of rental properties, Wise said.</LD>
<TE>   She stole cash deposits made out to Intercontinental Realty and
forged electronic signatures on checks to cash them for her own
benefit, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Gym Proposal Takes Plans Underground</HD>
<DH>Development: A compromise would put Little Tokyo facility
26 feet below ground and replace a parking lot with an art park. It
also would increase the cost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Proponents of a Little Tokyo recreation center embroiled in an
exhausting eight-year struggle hope their latest proposal for a gym
gets buried--literally.</LD>
<LD>   In a tug of war that has split a community accustomed to
consensus, an unusual proposal to construct the entire recreation
center underground with the 3.5-acre Central Avenue Art Park project
on top could prove the best compromise for the multiple parties
involved.</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting on Monday afternoon with councilwoman Jan Perry,
whose 9th District includes Little Tokyo, the gym's supporters hope
to convince her that down below is the place to go.</LD>
<TE>   In a recent letter to Bill Watanabe, executive director of the
Little Tokyo Service Center, the nonprofit group that is spearheading
the gym proposal, Perry indicated a willingness to pursue a "totally
underground project" as long as the group follows building procedures
in a timely manner and addresses the concerns of all current
stakeholders in the area, known as 1st Street North.</TE>
<TE>   David Nagano, member and former president of the Little Tokyo
Recreation Center Board, called the letter "closer than anything
we've ever had" to securing a site for the recreation center. With
Perry's support, the gym's proponents believe the City Council will
grant them permission to build on the site. If plans move ahead,
proponents say, the recreation center could open in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   But before anyone has permission to begin construction, the city
must find another location for a temporary parking garage on the
site, which houses about 1,000 spaces for the Los Angeles Police
Department and City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Perry so far has played referee in the conflict, convening and
moderating a pair of heated public forums in Little Tokyo in June and
July that were attended by hundreds of people.</TE>
<TE>   During the debates, representatives from the Veterans of the 100th
Battalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team, East West Players, Japanese
American National Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art's Geffen
Contemporary endorsed an art park, saying it would add serenity to
the site.</TE>
<TE>   The park, scheduled to be built with city and private funds, would
be overseen by a coalition of various groups and is envisioned as a
peaceful gathering space, with greenery and perhaps sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Though the World War II veterans worried that the proposed gym
would tower over their Go For Broke monument, which would have stood
just a few steps away, the East West Players fretted over noise
levels that could disrupt performances, as well as a lack of parking
and blocked access.</TE>
<TE>   Gym supporters, unfurling two long banners splattered with
children's handprints, called for a 36-foot-tall recreational
building squeezed between the future site of the Children's Museum of
Los Angeles and the Union Center for the Arts. They had a downsized,
2-acre art park in mind.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after the contentious verbal battles, recreation
center architect Hayahiko Takase made an informal pitch to the Little
Tokyo Community Council for an underground recreation center. The
latest drawings from Takase, who also designed Little Tokyo's New
Otani Hotel, show a six-court gym nestled 26 feet below ground, with
auxiliary rooms used for lockers, computer classes and a senior
citizens' lunch program. Also underground are 168 parking spaces.</TE>
<TE>   In a design much like a suspension bridge, the center's roof hangs
from a series of steel wires and posts protruding above ground. An
alternative design--which would virtually erase any evidence of the
building's supporting structures above the grass--relies on a 10-foot
truss just below ground to anchor the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "By putting it underground, it would no longer be too tall, too
big, too close or too noisy," Watanabe said of the proposed
45,000-square-foot gym.</TE>
<TE>   But it would be more expensive. At $40 to $45 more per square
foot, the recreation center's price tag could inflate from about $9
million to more than $11 million, said Dean Matsubayashi, the service
center's project manager.</TE>
<TE>   There are also two sets of utility lines running underground
across the site, which Takase said the building could avoid, and a
water table that comes up to 23 feet in some areas. Takase said the
building could be waterproofed by using asphalt walls and sump pumps.</TE>
<TE>   Current leasers who so ardently opposed the gym's above-ground
plan have approached this new development with cautious optimism,
stressing they must study the plan in detail. "We'll absolutely be
open to discussion," said Michael Maltzan, architect for the art
park. "Everybody will take a significant look."</TE>
<TE>   Though Christine Sato-Yamazaki, executive director of the Go for
Broke Educational Foundation, hesitated to immediately weigh in on
the plan, Daniel Mayeda, former co-president of the East West
Players' board of directors, said the new proposal addresses their
previous concerns and deemed it "very favorable."</TE>
<TE>   Battered by a drop in tourism after Sept. 11, many 1st Street
business owners welcome any plan that will draw people to Little
Tokyo. "It's been so bad lately," said Sanae Furuki, who has owned
Family Mart, which is located just south of the site, for 15 years.
"We need people; that's it."</TE>
<TE>   Many neighboring restaurant managers agreed--theorizing that even
those consumed with running around underground must trot up some time
to dish out dollars for a hot meal.</TE>

<LD>A former health care worker who reused needles to draw blood from
multiple patients was sentenced this week to a year in prison.</LD>
<LD>   In March 1999, a co-worker of Elaine Giorgi, 55, told superiors at
her Palo Alto clinic that Giorgi was reusing needles and mislabeling
blood samples. Giorgi later said she wanted to save supplies to show
supervisors that she could run a cost-efficient lab.</LD>
<LD>   Giorgi admitted to four charges of illegal treatment of medical
waste and one misdemeanor charge of altering medical records.</LD>
<TE>   Though no one was proven to have gotten sick from Giorgi's
actions, at the sentencing Santa Clara County Judge Hugh Mullin said
what she did was as dangerous as holding a loaded gun to the
patients' heads.</TE>
<TE>   Giorgi still faces two lawsuits and the SmithKline Beecham clinic
faces four.</TE>

<LD>The jury in the David Westerfield trial deliberated for three hours
Friday before adjourning for the weekend. It was the jury's seventh
day of deliberation.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield is accused of the kidnap and murder of 7-year-old
Danielle van Dam. On Friday, the jury asked to review testimony from
the county medical examiner and an entomologist who examined insects
found on Danielle's body.</LD>
<LD>   The medical examiner testified he was unable to determine the
cause of death. The entomologist, called by the defense, suggested
the body was dumped in a rural area while Westerfield was being
watched 24 hours a day by police.</LD>

<HD>Bill Would Make Felons Wait to Sell Their Stories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Assembly Judiciary Committee on Friday unanimously approved a
bill designed to partly restore California's prohibition against
felons selling their stories while their victims get no compensation.</LD>
<LD>   The bill (SB 1887) by Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz) was
forwarded to the full Assembly, where approval is a virtual
certainty.</LD>
<LD>   California's "Son of Sam" law was struck down last spring by the
state Supreme Court, which held that it was too broad and a violation
of the 1st Amendment right of freedom of speech.</LD>
<TE>   McPherson was thwarted in his effort to cure the constitutional
defects cited by the courts. As an alternative, his bill would
prohibit a felon from selling his or her crime story for at least 10
years after completing parole, a restriction that backers of the bill
believe cannot be overcome in the lifetimes of most criminals.</TE>

<LD>The hunt is on for a team of sophisticated robbers who stole
thousands of dollars worth of precious stones from a New York jewelry
salesman.</LD>
<LD>   The victim, whose name was not released, parked in a downtown
garage Thursday to make a sales call on a jewelry store and was
unloading his merchandise when a white van pulled in behind him.</LD>
<LD>   The driver's side sliding door popped open and a man in a baseball
cap grabbed the bag, dragging the salesman 30 feet before he let go
of the case.</LD>
<TE>   The value of the goods was at least $20,000, police said.</TE>

<LD>An importing company on Friday recalled a gel candy that poses a

<LD>   Oakland-based D&amp;V Trading Inc. has recalled the litchi, mango,
taro and other flavors of Konnyaku Jelly Candies sold under the D&amp;V
and JoJomo brands. The candy is distributed in stores throughout
Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   The brightly colored sweets come in mouth-sized servings and are
made of a thick, fruit-flavored gel that people suck out of small
plastic cups. The Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Food and
Drug Administration say it poses a serious choking hazard,
particularly to infants, children and the elderly.</LD>
<TE>   The gel is so sticky that rescue workers have reported being
unable to dislodge it from the throats of choking children.</TE>

<HD>Latinos Hear Both Sides of Secession Issue</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Breakup opponents say new cities would dilute
political clout. Supporters say L.A. officials are putting personal
ambition ahead of public interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With polls showing most San Fernando Valley Latinos favoring
secession, a coalition of Latino political and community leaders
launched a campaign Friday to persuade their community that a breakup
will be harmful to those who reside on both sides of the Santa Monica
Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   It was a day of dueling news conferences as several pro-secession
Latinos held their own event less than 50 feet away from the
anti-secession rally as soon as it ended.</LD>
<LD>   More than 50 Latino activists, including Assemblyman Tony Cardenas
(D-Panorama City) and Los Angeles City Council President Alex
Padilla, rallied at the new Pacoima Branch Library to argue that
secession is not needed because Los Angeles is beginning to improve
service to the long-neglected Latino areas in the Valley.</LD>
<TE>   The secession opponents also warned that a new Valley city may not
provide rent control, affordable housing and other programs available
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Secession, we believe, will be detrimental to our quality of life
in the Latino community," said Cecelia Barragan, a leader of the
Latino Coalition for a United Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   She said a large percentage of renters in the Valley are Latino,
and they currently enjoy protections of Los Angeles' rent-control
laws, but there is no guarantee a Valley city would adopt the same
laws.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has proposed creating a $100-million trust fund for
affordable housing, something that would not be guaranteed by a new
Valley city, said Barragan, a longtime Pacoima resident who
represents a group of faith-based and community-based nonprofits.</TE>
<TE>   "The power of the Latino community will be diluted if we separate
from Los Angeles," added Maria Calleros of the Valley chapter of the
Mexican American Political Assn.</TE>
<TE>   A poll by The Times on July 2 indicated 52% of Valley Latinos
supported secession, while a survey this week by KABC-TV Channel 7
also found majority Latino support for the proposed breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said he was not worried by the polls, believing Latino
voters will turn around once they get facts from the anti-secession
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the anti-breakup rally ended, a dozen
pro-secessionists, mostly Latino, called their own news conference to
declare that Padilla and Cardenas are out of touch with the wishes of
the Latino majority in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "The individuals who have the audacity and the arrogance and the
self-serving interests to say they speak for all Latinos are wrong,"
said David Hernandez, a secession supporter running for mayor of the
Valley city. "They do not speak for me."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Ferreyra, a council candidate in the proposed city, said
the poll results make clear that Latino voters recognize the benefits
of secession.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists, who were interrupted by heckling and a car
alarm that repeatedly sounded, said Padilla and Cardenas are opposing
secession out of their own self-interest because they covet higher
office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas is running for Los Angeles City Council because he is
being forced out of the Assembly by term limits, and Ferreyra said
Padilla wants to be mayor of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreyra said those ambitions also explain some noticeable
absences from the anti-secession rally. Originally, the organizers
said the rally would show the unity of all the major Latino elected
officials in the Valley, and said state Sen. Richard Alarcon
(D-Sylmar) and San Fernando Mayor Cindy Montanez would be at the
event, but neither appeared.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon said he tried to attend but had to chair a hearing on the
threat of a dockworker strike. Organizers said Montanez would hold a
separate news conference later.</TE>
<TE>   However, others noted that Alarcon has been at odds with Cardenas
and Padilla ever since Padilla ran for his old council seat against a
candidate that Alarcon backed in 1999. And, with Alarcon's support,
Montanez recently defeated the candidate handpicked by Cardenas and
Padilla for Cardenas' Assembly seat in the Democratic primary.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreyra said he wasn't surprised that the promised appearance of
Padilla, Cardenas, Alarcon and Montanez did not materialize, adding
that he believes it comes down to Alarcon and Padilla both wanting to
be mayor of Los Angeles. "They are concerned about their careers and
their political future," Ferreyra said.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon denied there is a rift in the anti-secession campaign,
saying he is not even considering a run for mayor, and he has been in
communication with Padilla and Cardenas on coordinating their fight
against a breakup. Montanez did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the county registrar-recorder said Friday that of the
121 candidates for Valley city office who filed petitions on time, 10
have been disqualified for lack of sufficient signatures. The
screening process cut the number of candidates for mayor of the
Valley from 12 to 10, with Allen Bradford Kennamer and Wayne Crochet
scratched from the list of those making the ballot.</TE>

<HD>Latinos Choose Sides in Secession Debate</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Politicians lead opposition drive after polls
show support for breakaway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With polls showing most San Fernando Valley Latinos favoring
secession, a coalition of Latino political and community leaders
launched a campaign Friday to persuade their community that a breakup
will be harmful to those who reside on both sides of the Santa Monica
Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   It was a day of dueling news conferences as several pro-secession
Latinos held their own event less than 50 feet away from the
anti-secession rally as soon as it ended.</LD>
<LD>   More than 50 Latino activists, including Assemblyman Tony Cardenas
(D-Panorama City) and Los Angeles City Council President Alex
Padilla, rallied at the new Pacoima Branch Library to argue that
secession is not needed because Los Angeles is beginning to improve
service to the long-neglected Latino areas in the Valley.</LD>
<TE>   The secession opponents also warned that a new Valley city may not
provide rent control, affordable housing and other aid programs
available in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Secession, we believe, will be detrimental to our quality of life
in the Latino community," said Cecelia Barragan, a leader of the
Latino Coalition for a United Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   She said a large percentage of renters in the Valley are Latino,
and they currently enjoy protections of Los Angeles' rent-control
laws, but there is no guarantee a Valley city would adopt the same
laws.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has proposed creating a $100-million trust fund for
affordable housing, something that would not be guaranteed by a new
Valley city, said Barragan, a longtime Pacoima resident who
represents a group of faith-based and community-based nonprofits.</TE>
<TE>   Latino Clout</TE>
<TE>   "The power of the Latino community will be diluted if we separate
from Los Angeles," added Maria Calleros of the Valley chapter of the
Mexican American Political Assn.</TE>
<TE>   A poll by The Times on July 2 indicated 52% of Valley Latinos
supported secession, while a survey this week by KABC-TV Channel 7
also found majority Latino support for the proposed breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said he was not worried by the polls, believing Latino
voters will turn around once they get facts from the anti-secession
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists Respond</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the anti-breakup rally ended, a dozen
pro-secessionists, mostly Latino, called their own news conference to
declare that Padilla and Cardenas are out of touch with the wishes of
the Latino majority in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "The individuals who have the audacity and the arrogance and the
self-serving interests to say they speak for all Latinos are wrong,"
said David Hernandez, a secession supporter running for mayor of the
Valley city. "They do not speak for me."</TE>
<TE>   Motives Questioned</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Ferreyra, a council candidate in the proposed city, said
the poll results make clear that Latino voters recognize the benefits
of secession.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists, who were interrupted by heckling and a car
alarm that repeatedly sounded, said Padilla and Cardenas are opposing
secession out of their own self-interest because they plan to seek
higher office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas is running for Los Angeles City Council because he is
being forced out of the Assembly by term limits, and Ferreyra said
Padilla wants to be mayor of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreyra said those ambitions also explain some noticeable
absences from the anti-secession rally.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the organizers said the rally would show the unity of
all the major Latino elected officials in the Valley, and said state
Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) and San Fernando Mayor Cindy Montanez
would be at the event, but neither appeared.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon said he tried to attend but had to chair a hearing on the
threat of a dockworker strike.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers said Montanez would hold a separate news conference
later.</TE>
<TE>   However, others noted that Alarcon has been at odds with Cardenas
and Padilla ever since Padilla ran for his old council seat against a
candidate that Alarcon backed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   And, with Alarcon's support, Montanez recently defeated the
candidate handpicked by Cardenas and Padilla for Cardenas' Assembly
seat in the Democratic primary.</TE>
<TE>   Political Futures</TE>
<TE>   Ferreyra said he wasn't surprised that the promised appearance of
Padilla, Cardenas, Alarcon and Montanez did not materialize, adding
that he believes it comes down to Alarcon and Padilla both wanting to
be mayor of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They are concerned about their careers and their political
future," Ferreyra said.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon denied there is a rift in the anti-secession campaign,
saying he is not even considering a run for mayor, and he has been in
communication with Padilla and Cardenas on coordinating their fight
against a breakup. Montanez did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Candidates</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the county registrar-recorder said Friday that of the
121 candidates for Valley city office who filed petitions on time, 10
have been disqualified for lack of sufficient signatures.</TE>
<TE>   The screening process cut the number of candidates for mayor of
the Valley from 12 to 10, with Allen Bradford Kennamer and Wayne

<LD>An 11-year-old girl who was killed when the car she was riding in
crashed into parked vehicles in Lancaster was identified Friday by
authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Lisa Marie Still of Lancaster died in the 3 a.m. Thursday crash on
180th Street East, just south of Avenue O, Los Angeles County
coroner's spokesman Dave Campbell said.</LD>
<LD>   The driver of the 1999 Mazda, an unlicensed 15-year-old girl who
was related to the victim, apparently lost control of the vehicle,
California Highway Patrol Lt. Andria Witmer said. The girl was
treated and released from Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in
Mission Hills on Thursday, a hospital spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities have not decided whether they will file criminal
charges against the driver, pending the outcome of their
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Two other passengers--another 11-year-old girl and an 18-year-old
man--were flown to local hospitals, where they remained in critical
condition Friday, authorities said.</TE>

<LD>The Antelope Valley Union High School District board has unanimously
approved a five-year extension to the charter of a school that owes
$800,000 to the state Department of Education.</LD>
<LD>   Desert Sands Charter School, which offers home-based learning for
struggling students, will continue to operate under the district,
even though state officials have said they will not release further
funding to the school until it repays the money it owes.</LD>
<LD>   State education officials determined they gave the school money it
did not deserve last year after an audit showed the school could not
back up its enrollment figures. Assistant Supt. Jane Maxwell said the
school will rely on other public and private funds until it can repay
the money.</LD>

<HD>Man Shot by Officer Wins Jury Award</HD>
<DH>Police: The $2-million verdict caps a three-week civil
trial. The 68-year-old victim had sought $10 million in the June 2000
incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GLOVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court jury Friday awarded $2.045 million to a
68-year-old man who was shot in the back by an LAPD officer two years
ago after a dispute over a traffic ticket.</LD>
<LD>   The civil court jurors determined that then-LAPD Officer Ronald
Orosco violated Charles Beatty's civil rights when he fired four
shots at the motorist after an argument between the two men. Beatty
was hit once. The bullet remains lodged in his back.</LD>
<LD>   Charged with the crime of firing into an occupied vehicle, Orosco
pleaded no contest and is serving a five-year sentence in state
prison.</LD>
<TE>   Beatty's lawyers had asked jurors to award him $10 million to pay
for his medical bills, compensate him for continuing pain and
suffering and to punish Orosco for shooting him.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lesser amount, attorney Carl E. Douglas said he was
elated by the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, a very powerful message has been sent--and will be
received by the city of Los Angeles and the LAPD--so that tragedies
of this type can be prevented in the future," said Douglas, who tried
the case with attorney John E. Sweeney.</TE>
<TE>   Beatty, a tall, gray-haired man dressed Friday in blue jeans and a
corduroy sports coat, said he was pleased with the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that I've been compensated," he said. "I don't think the
amount really matters."</TE>
<TE>   The verdict in the case followed a three-week trial and three days
of deliberations that several jurors described as highly emotional.
Some jurors wanted to award Beatty $4 million. Others felt the case
was worth less than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't fair. He should have gotten more," said jury forewoman
Pearl Whitfield, 58. Whitfield said some jurors placed less value on
Beatty's life because "he's not a doctor or lawyer or something like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Juror Angie Gillingham said she found it difficult to give Beatty
as much money as the jury finally did because she believed he was
"50% responsible" for getting shot in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Gillingham said she believed Beatty had been obnoxious and
argumentative with Orosco and his partner, Officer Gorgonio Medina.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he contributed to what he got," Gillingham said.</TE>
<TE>   But juror Billy Kimball said some African American members of the
panel argued persuasively that jurors who did not live in areas such
as the one in the LAPD's 77th Division, where the shooting took
place, could not understand the fear of being confronted by police.</TE>
<TE>   "They said the next time this happens, it's going to be to me or
my kid or my husband," Kimball said outside the courtroom. "That's
hard to argue with. It creates a very emotional situation."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors reported at midday that they could not render a verdict on
allegations of false imprisonment and civil rights violations by
Medina. At that point, Beatty's lawyers agreed to drop those charges
from the complaint. Jurors reached their verdict with respect to
ex-officer Orosco hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Richard Arias, who represented Medina and the
city in the case, said simply, "Justice was done." He declined to
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The encounter between Beatty and the officers took place on June
14, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Orosco and Medina, who were in an unmarked police car and were not
in uniform, were stopped at a traffic light talking to a transient
when Beatty pulled up behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Beatty said he waited as the traffic signal changed from red to
green several times before he finally became impatient and pulled
around the nondescript Chevrolet. He said he was unaware at the time
that the two men inside the car were police officers. As Beatty
pulled away, he made an illegal left turn.</TE>
<TE>   The officers then decided to pull him over.</TE>
<TE>   Beatty admits he became argumentative, insisting that the officers
should not have been blocking traffic.</TE>
<TE>   After he was ticketed, he and Orosco traded insults as Beatty
walked toward his car.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Orosco said, he decided to arrest Beatty for
allegedly challenging him to a fight. According to the officer, as he
attempted to remove Beatty from the car, Beatty resisted and tried to
drive away.</TE>
<TE>   Fearful that he was going to be dragged into traffic, Orosco said
he opened fire, hitting Beatty in the back as he drove off.</TE>

<LD>Two vehicles collided at a busy intersection in Santa Ana on Friday,
sending one through the plate-glass window of a check-cashing
business and hitting a customer.</LD>
<LD>   The driver of a Buick was making a left turn at the corner of 17th
and North Spurgeon streets when it struck a westbound vehicle,
according to Santa Ana Police Officer Mario Corona.</LD>
<LD>   The Buick plowed through the window and landed about 10 feet into
Ria Check Cashing. An unidentified woman was pinned to the counter,
Corona said. The woman appeared to be "conscious, breathing and
answering questions," Corona said.</LD>
<TE>   Both the woman and the driver of the Buick, who complained of
chest pains, were taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Their
condition was unknown.</TE>
<TE>   No one was arrested, and the accident is being investigated.</TE>

<HD>Players Set Strike Date; Fans Angry</HD>
<DH>Labor: With the union and team owners unable to reach a
contract, a walkout is planned for Aug. 30.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As prediction became reality and baseball's players union set an Aug.
30 strike date Friday, fans all over, from the vacation White House
to the local pub, kicked the dirt in frustration and let out a
collective jeer.</LD>
<LD>   For the ninth time since 1972, the nation's signature sport is
threatening to shut down, provoking wrath from the same loyalists who
found solace in the game after last fall's tragedies.</LD>
<LD>   On a day when players and owners seemed to harden their
negotiating positions, President Bush, himself a former team owner,
bluntly told both sides to compromise. If play is halted, he said, "a
lot of fans are going to be furious, and I'm one."</LD>
<TE>   He'll have plenty of company in Southern California, where
baseball enthusiasts braced for a doubleheader of disappointment. A
strike could imperil this season's rare, synchronized playoff runs by
the Los Angeles Dodgers and Anaheim Angels, reducing their
achievements to record book asterisks.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a shame with the Angels finally getting it together,"
said Dale Wallace, 52, of Laguna Niguel, chief financial officer of
an aerospace company. The team is on course for its first postseason
berth since 1986. "They'll be blowing it big time" by going on
strike, Wallace said.</TE>
<TE>   Fans evinced little interest Friday in the conflicting plans
owners and players swap almost daily for luxury taxes or other
cost-containment measures that have been obstacles to a new
collective contract for players. Few had even bothered to pick a
side.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think they're all freaking greedy," said Tony Hauser, 45,
bug-eyed with anger Friday outside Charlie's Trios in El Sereno. "The
players have the best life in the world, but they're not
satisfied.... It's sickening."</TE>
<TE>   Many fans threatened to leave baseball forever, treating it like a
bad relationship or an addiction they would no longer enable. Signs
cropped up in stadiums nationwide saying--often in saltier
language--that if the players walked out again, they should expect
the cold shoulder when they return, or none at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we should strike back," said Joe Radous, 61, visiting
Anaheim from Chicago. "I want these players to play in empty
stadiums."</TE>
<TE>   David Zelaya, a Dodger fan from Culver City, said he's barely over
the last strike, which lingered for 232 days in 1994 and 1995,
forcing the cancellation of the '94 World Series. Average attendance
dropped by one-fifth the following year and has never fully
rebounded.</TE>
<TE>   Angel fan David Lahodny, 50, attending the team's Friday night
game against Cleveland, said he embraced baseball after the '94
strike and he'd do it again. But he acknowledged that he'd have to
find someone other than his wife, Jackie, to go to games with him.
"'If they strike, I'm not going to come back," she said firmly.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, fans wondered why all of this wasn't settled long ago,
when the players' contract expired in November, and why, with $3.5
billion in annual revenue and average salaries of just under $2.4
million, baseball's owners and players can't make a deal.</TE>
<TE>   If baseball folds for the season in two weeks, it would cut off
the year's most compelling plot lines just as they reach their
climax:</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins, a team baseball attempted to contract out of
existence, are headed for a division title; San Francisco Giants
slugger Barry Bonds is pounding closer to Hank Aaron's career home
run record; Dodger closer Eric Gagne and New York Yankee second
baseman Alfonso Soriano are having breakthrough seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Also, at a time when the economy is struggling and thousands of
people are being laid off, it's poor timing for players to walk away
from such choice work, said Dan Spafford, 60, a printer from South
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurateurs and bar owners around Edison Field, who have ridden
the wave of Angel success, lamented the crushing effect a strike
could have on them.</TE>
<TE>   "Business would drop 60% to 70% on game days," said Sergio
Miramontes, manager of National Sports Grill. When the Yankees or
Boston Red Sox come to town, he said, the place filled up three hours
before game time and was a "madhouse" until 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Though a strike would leave a gaping hole for baseball purists,
the deadline had almost no effect on less picky sports enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   "Who needs baseball when we've got football?" said Al Lutu, 43, of
Winnetka, Calif., raising his arms as if he were signaling a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Lutu and the other more than two dozen patrons at Schoonerville in
Canoga Park seemed indifferent to the Dodgers-New York Mets game
playing on one of the seven television sets in the beer-and-burger
joint. The other six were tuned to the St. Louis Rams-Chicago Bears
preseason game.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Mark Travasano paid $3,000 for luxury box seats at
Edison Field for an Angels-Yankees game. He and his children went
home electrified after the home team pulled out a 2-1 victory. Would
he ever shell out that kind of cash again?</TE>
<TE>   "If they strike, no way," he said.</TE>

<HD>FERC Sues State Over Defiance on Cal-ISO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sued California on Friday in
U.S. District Court for defying its order to dissolve the board that
oversees much of the state's electricity grid.</LD>
<LD>   The suit comes nine days after Gov. Gray Davis' appointees to the
board of the California Independent System Operator voted to ignore a
FERC order that they disband and create a board free of political
influence.</LD>
<LD>   Davis press secretary Steven Maviglio said Friday afternoon that
the state had not been notified of the lawsuit. But Kevin Cadden,
director of external affairs for FERC, said the suit had been filed
in federal court in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be inappropriate of the agency to comment until such
time as the Cal-ISO has had the opportunity to review our filing,"
said Cadden.</TE>
<TE>   The suit asks the court to compel California to follow an order
issued last month by FERC, the nation's top regulator of wholesale
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   FERC called the existing Cal-ISO board of five Davis appointees
"insufficiently independent" to operate transmission lines that cross
state lines.</TE>
<TE>   The agency ordered Cal-ISO to create a two-tiered governing body,
with an independent decision-making board advised by a panel of
people with a stake in the operation of the transmission grid, such
as power plant owners, consumer advocates and utility officials.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' four appointees--there is one vacancy--voted unanimously
Aug. 7 to ignore the FERC order. State officials said then that the
dispute seemed destined for court.</TE>
<TE>   Davis addressed his appointees before the vote, calling the order
"nothing less than a hostile takeover of California's electricity
grid by the federal government."</TE>
<TE>   The governor blames the federal commission for failing to step in
aggressively when exorbitant prices and power shortages plagued the
state's electricity market in 2000 and 2001. California has accused
private power sellers, who are ultimately regulated by FERC, of
rigging the market to keep prices high.</TE>
<TE>   On a related issue, Davis is waiting for FERC to rule on
California's request for $9 billion in refunds from various companies
accused of overcharging.</TE>
<TE>   During the power crisis, the Cal-ISO board had 26 members
representing various interests, and it bogged down in lengthy debates
over whether to cap the price of electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed a bill in January that replaced that board with his
own appointees. FERC questioned his authority to do so, but did not
challenge him until last month.</TE>
<TE>   California and FERC have been battling over the Cal-ISO board
since the transmission agency was created in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deregulation plan designed by California and approved by
FERC, Cal-ISO is to serve as an unbiased traffic cop for the movement
of electricity along an electricity grid serving three-quarters of
California. The state's regulated utilities gave up control of the
grid as part of the deregulation plan.</TE>

<HD>Parted Twin Has 2nd Surgery</HD>
<DH>Medicine: The girl's operation follows discovery of an
infection in the lining of her brain. Still, her condition has not
worsened.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maria Teresa Quiej Alvarez, one of the formerly conjoined Guatemalan
twins, underwent surgery lasting more than three hours Friday after
doctors discovered a bacterial infection in the lining of her brain.</LD>
<LD>   The surgery was the second for the 1-year-old since she was
separated from her sister, Maria de Jesus, in a marathon operation at
UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital last week.</LD>
<LD>   Hours after that separation, doctors returned her to the operating
room to relieve pressure on the brain caused by a hematoma, a pooling
of blood under the scalp.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Irwin Weiss said that blood collected around Maria Teresa's
brain during the initial separation and that much of it remains in
the lining. The infection probably was caused by that excess blood,
which doctors operated to remove, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Weiss said Friday's procedure was only "a bump in
the road" and did not change the girl's serious but stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   A ventilator, which had been removed Thursday, probably will be
needed for the next few days, Weiss added.</TE>
<TE>   Maria de Jesus has been breathing without aid since Tuesday and is
alert, being fed through a baby bottle and sometimes laughing, Weiss
said.</TE>
<TE>   Her condition also is serious but stable.</TE>

<LD>A Ventura bookkeeper has been sentenced to four years in state prison
for embezzling $191,000 from the real estate company that employed
her, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Katherine A. Bordeaux, 38, pleaded guilty last month to grand
theft, fraudulent use of a computer and filing a false tax return,
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Howard Wise.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Edward Brodie ordered Bordeaux
to repay $190,998 to her employer, Intercontinental Realty in
Ventura, and $16,884 to the California Franchise Tax Board. She also
must pay $2,900 in fines.</LD>
<TE>   The fraud began in January 1997 when the owner of the real estate
company became sick and Bordeaux took over accounting
responsibilities for a group of rental properties, Wise said.</TE>

<LD>Police have arrested a 27-year-old man they suspect of kidnapping a
woman from her east Ventura bedroom and sexually assaulting her
before she escaped from him in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Marcus Brent Fields was found in a Pasadena motel room, police
said Friday. Bail was set at $250,000 as he awaited transfer from the
Los Angeles County Jail to Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   At about 1 a.m. on June 27, Fields slipped into the 52-year-old
woman's Twin Rivers Circle home through an unlocked sliding glass
door, police said. Before ordering her into the car, police said,
Fields told the woman and her fiance that he had a gun.</LD>
<TE>   In Oxnard, he sexually assaulted the woman, according to
investigators. Forcing her to withdraw cash from an ATM, he drove the
woman to the Hollywood area, authorities said. They said the woman
was still in her nightgown when she escaped by flagging down a
passing California Highway Patrol cruiser after Fields left the car
for coffee.</TE>
<TE>   Fields was identified with the help of tips from people who
recognized a composite drawing that had been released to the media,
police said. His arrest Thursday, a joint effort by Ventura and
Pasadena police, took place without incident, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Veterans Going for the Gold and Camaraderie</HD>
<DH>Fitness: VA's Golden Age Games showcase the therapeutic
value of sports.</DH>

<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alice Barszcz rolled her wheelchair forward, placed her bowling ball
on a ramp and let it roll down the lane.</LD>
<LD>   Although the 81-year-old New Jersey woman wasn't happy that she
missed a spare, she was ecstatic to be part of the 16th annual
National Veterans Golden Age Games.</LD>
<LD>   "I love the competition, camaraderie and the chance to see friends
I only see once a year," she said. "It keeps me young."</LD>
<TE>   Barszcz was among more than 500 military veterans gathered in Los
Angeles this week for the national sports and recreational
competition, which ended Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes 55 and older vied for medals in 34 events, including
swimming, bicycling, bowling, golf, table tennis, dominoes,
horseshoes and shuffleboard, organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   More than a sporting event, the weeklong competition is a showcase
for the therapeutic value of sports, fitness and recreation in the
lives of older Americans, said John Fitzgerald, games co-coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Any veteran receiving care at VA medical facilities is eligible to
compete in the games, which are co-sponsored by the Veterans of
Foreign Wars and Department of Veterans Affairs, with the help of
thousands of local volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Golden Age Games athletes, in a system patterned after the Olympic
Games, live in a "village" and travel via shuttle bus to event venues
scattered around a host city.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Century Plaza Hotel in Century City served as the
athletes' village, where the opening and closing ceremonies were
held.</TE>
<TE>   Barszcz and about 90 other athletes boarded a bus bound for
Brunswick Matador Bowl in Northridge on Friday morning. There,
visually impaired bowlers were helped by volunteer guides and
wheelchair bowlers placed their bowling balls atop ramps that were
set up on the lanes.</TE>
<TE>   After her final turn, Barszcz lamented that she was probably out
of medal contention because she scored only 91, well below her 110
average.</TE>
<TE>   "But at 81 years and 10 months, I think I'm doing pretty good,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert Jadwin of Chicago, who had snared a bronze medal earlier
in wheelchair table tennis, was looking forward to going for the gold
in adaptive bowling. But even if he had come away from the games
empty-handed, he said, it wouldn't have mattered because he had
gotten something worth more to him than medals.</TE>
<TE>   "The games have given me so much pride and joy," he said, "and a
feeling that I belong."</TE>

<HD>Cheating Bosses May Face Snitching</HD>
<DH>Legislation: A bill to make employees report illegal
corporate fiscal practices wins panel's approval. Business and oil
interests oppose it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Over the objections of businesses and oil interests, an Assembly
committee on Friday endorsed a bill requiring employees to report
cases of fraud by their corporate bosses and imposing severe fines on
executives for falsifying financial reports.</LD>
<LD>   The bill by Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) squeaked out of the
Judiciary Committee with no votes to spare and was sent to the
Appropriations Committee for further screening. Democrats voted for
it, but Republicans refused to vote.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation advanced as a report circulated that Gov. Gray
Davis, who is running for reelection but seldom signals his position
on controversial bills, might sign the measure if it gets to him. A
Davis spokesman said the governor had not taken a position on the
bill (SB 783).</LD>
<TE>   Polls show that the public strongly supports stiff punishment of
chief executive officers, corporate directors and managers who
misrepresent a business' financial position in order to make it look
more profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Heller, lobbyist for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights, said employees knew of financial irregularities at recently
collapsed Enron but failed to blow the whistle, because "they had no
safe way to get the information in the right hands."</TE>
<TE>   Spurred by disclosures of corporate corruption, President Bush and
Congress recently clamped new reporting standards on businesses. But
Escutia said tougher requirements were needed in California to police
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, an employee with "actual knowledge" that superiors
had engaged in financial fraud would be required to report it to the
state attorney general's office, which would investigate or relay the
information to regulatory authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would target the top echelon of company
executives. A maximum civil fine of up to $100,000 would be levied
against officers, directors and members of a limited liability
company who failed to report illegal actions that would harm
investors, employees, pensioners or others.</TE>
<TE>   Company managers would be subject to fines of up to $50,000 if
they knew about the fraud but did not disclose it to the attorney
general or other government officials. The company itself or a
limited liability corporation also could be fined $1 million for the
same violations.</TE>
<TE>   Escutia charged that the new federal standards were weak and
"designed to give corporations a chance to avoid criminal
prosecution." But lobbyists for the California Chamber of Commerce
and the Western States Petroleum Assn., which represents virtually
all the major oil companies, attacked the provision requiring
employees who know fraud is occurring to report it. Such
whistle-blowers would have to have "actual knowledge" of the illegal
activity, not merely a suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   The business and oil advocates called for voluntary programs that
would "encourage" reporting but not mandate it.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) asked why it would
not be good public policy to "require an employee who has actual
knowledge [of fraud] to report it." In reply, Sher Gonzalez,
representing the state Chamber of Commerce, said the bill suggested a
revisit of "McCarthyism."</TE>
<TE>   "We do not think it is good public policy to require people to
report to the government the conduct of others," Gonzalez testified.
"In general, we don't require people to be the eyes and ears of law
enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   Cassie Gilson, representing the oil companies, testified that
damage could occur to the company if the attorney general publicly
announced an investigation based on the incorrect suspicions of a
whistle-blower. She warned that this would "cause the stock prices to
go in the toilet."</TE>
<TE>   But Escutia insisted that the bill dealt only with an employee's
"actual knowledge" of an illegal act and not on hearsay or
suspicions.</TE>

<HD>Arleta Man Sentenced in 1986 Slaying of Woman Protecting
Her Daughter</HD>

<LD>An Arleta man who fled to Mexico more than 15 years ago after he and
his brother killed a 21-year-old woman trying to protect her daughter
was sentenced Friday to 19 years to life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Montez Zepeda, 40, was convicted May 1 of second-degree
murder in the Dec. 28, 1986, slaying of Patricia Lemus of San
Fernando. He fled to Mexico soon after but returned two years ago to
the San Fernando Valley, where he was arrested.</LD>
<LD>   In 1988, his brother, Carlos, had been sentenced to 33 years to
life in prison for killing Lemus.</LD>
<TE>   The latest sentence was a relief for members of the Lemus family,
who have attended most of the San Fernando Superior Court appearances
of Zepeda and those of his brother 15 years ago. For many family
members, such as Lemus' sister Veronica, Friday's sentencing was
"justice at last."</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Lemus was killed after she pulled into the parking lot of
a San Fernando strip mall to avoid traffic on Rinaldi Street and talk
to friends. There she encountered the Zepeda brothers, who were
riding through the lot on a motorcycle, Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie
Samuels said.</TE>
<TE>   Omar Zepeda had fought with a man on a nearby street, left and
returned on a motorcycle with his brother and a gun, looking for the
man.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers found him hiding near Lemus' car, Samuels said.
Lemus' 18-month-old daughter, Vanessa, was asleep in the car, she
said. According to witnesses, Lemus shouted, "Don't shoot. Don't
shoot! My baby is in the car!" Carlos Zepeda then shot Lemus in the
face at point-blank range and rode off with his brother, Samuels
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They just wanted to kill someone that night," Samuels said.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Zepeda was arrested the next day, but Omar fled to Mexico,
where he started a new life, Samuels said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department detectives said Zepeda told them he
stayed with an aunt.</TE>
<TE>   He later got married and moved to Tijuana, where he joined the
police force, he told detectives.</TE>
<TE>   Zepeda was arrested two years ago when he returned to San Fernando
to work at his family's restaurant, she said.</TE>

My baby is in the car!" Carlos Zepeda then shot Lemus in the face at
point-blank range and rode off with his brother, Samuels said.</TE>
<TE>   "They just wanted to kill someone that night," Samuels said.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Zepeda was arrested the next day, but Omar fled to Mexico,
where he started a new life, Samuels said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department detectives said Zepeda told them he
stayed with an aunt.</TE>
<TE>   He later got married and moved to Tijuana, where he joined the
police force, he told detectives.</TE>
<TE>   Zepeda was arrested two years ago when he returned to San Fernando
to work at his family's restaurant, she said.</TE>

<HD>Angels Are Keeping It Shortsighted and Sweet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels insist that Friday's news of the players' union setting a
strike date for Aug. 30 does not give them a sense of urgency to be
in playoff contention when the deadline for baseball's ninth work
stoppage since 1972 arrives.</LD>
<LD>   They say they play with a heightened sense of urgency every game.</LD>
<LD>   Friday night's game at Edison Field was no different as the Angels
jumped on the Cleveland Indians early, then held on for a 5-4 win in
front of 41,356.</LD>
<TE>   "This team never thinks that far ahead," said Angel closer Troy
Percival, who picked up his 29th save by striking out the three
batters he faced in the ninth. "We think day-to-day we have to win
every day."</TE>
<TE>   In winning their sixth straight game, and eighth in 11, the Angels
(73-48) moved 25 games over .500, their best winning percentage since
1995.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels also moved a half-game behind the first-place Seattle
Mariners in the American League West while maintaining a 2 1/2-game
edge over the Oakland Athletics in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   It all begs the question--with the Angels playing their best ball
since the epic collapse of 1995, why would they want to strike?</TE>
<TE>   Angel player representatives Scott Schoeneweis and Jarrod Washburn
said the players' setting a strike date in the midst of such a
successful campaign should speak volumes to the fans about how
serious the players are in the labor dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "The playoffs don't come around that often," Schoeneweis said.
"But sometimes you have to separate the good of the whole from the
good of our [individual] teams."</TE>
<TE>   Angel right-hander John Lackey (5-2) was good enough against the
Indians. The rookie, making his 10th start, got the win after going
seven innings and giving up one run on six hits. He also had two
strikeouts and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   "You're never totally settled," said Lackey, who has been called
up twice from triple-A Salt Lake, the last time on June 28. "But I'm
getting comfortable. The guys getting runs early definitely helps.
The early runs are big. They've been scoring for me lately so I've
been pitching on the right days."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Angels had their leadoff batter reach base safely in
the first seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Run-scoring ground outs by Orlando Palmeiro and Garret Anderson in
the first inning brought home David Eckstein and Darin Erstad, who
was back in the lineup after not starting the previous two games
because of a fatigued right leg.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels made it 4-0 in the second when No. 9 hitter Adam
Kennedy's ground-rule double to right field scored Brad Fullmer and
Scott Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland scored in the fourth, when Ellis Burks took Lackey deep
for a solo home run on a 2-and-2 pitch. It was Burks' 26th homer of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels got the run back, though, in the bottom of the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer, who singled to start things, scored on Eckstein's one-out
sacrifice fly to center field.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians made things interesting in the eighth, after Lackey
exited, sending seven batters to the plate and scoring three times.</TE>
<TE>   But enter Percival, who was pitching as though he was already in
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "He had excellent velocity with his command," said Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia. "When he has that working together, he's tough."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia, a member of the Dodgers' 1981 World Series championship
team, is no stranger to seasons being cut short by labor disputes.</TE>
<TE>   That year, the Dodgers benefited by a split-season strike,
qualifying for the playoffs because they led the National League West
by a half-game when the strike hit.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Scioscia said he would not manage as though the Angels
should be in playoff position when they go to bed Aug. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not looking at it like that because there are so many more
variables that have to come into play to say the season is going to
come to an end where the standings are on Aug. 30," he said. "How
long would a strike be? Would you be able to pick up the season and
have a meaningful pennant race after that?</TE>
<TE>   "We're not putting any sense of urgency on it. We're going to go
out here and try to win every game we can as hard as we can. That's
our approach anyway so I don't know how you alter that."</TE>

<HD>Mickelson Still Hasn't Got a Clue</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Someday, maybe even someday soon, Phil Mickelson is going to have
some explaining to do. About how he won his first major.</LD>
<LD>   Until then, is there anybody out there who can figure out when the
time will be right for Lefty?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe Phil will leave enough clues behind to make it simple.</LD>
<TE>   He will nail every single drive and the ball will roll to the
middle of the fairway.</TE>
<TE>   He won't ever get sand on his golf ball. Well, maybe once, but
then he'll show his deft touch and finesse it out with the magic that
is in his club and it will look as if he is popping a bar of soap out
of the bathtub.</TE>
<TE>   He will read every line, recognize every break, laugh at every
grain, know every change of speed on every green and make every putt
without breaking a sweat.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that's how we will know it's Lefty's time.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, we're probably just going to have to keep scratching
our heads, wondering when he is going to win a major.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson's streak of major tournaments without a title reached
42, and counting, Friday at Hazeltine National Golf Club, where he
put himself out of the running again, this time at the PGA
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   It was another perplexing display by one of golf's most talented
players. First, he finished his rain-delayed first round with a 76.
Then he double-bogeyed the last hole of his second round, winding up
at even par, and four over after 36 holes, just making the cut.</TE>
<TE>   What distinguished his latest disappointment from the others? All
you had to do was listen to Mickelson to get an idea. He said he
thought he'd played pretty well, that he'd missed a couple of putts
that could have gone in. Then he said he really didn't know what had
gone wrong. He said he didn't know what else to say.</TE>
<TE>   Well, if Lefty himself has no clue, then who does?</TE>
<TE>   This would probably be a good time to call in the amateur
analysts, because there are plenty of theories going around.</TE>
<TE>   Prime among them is Mickelson's "feel-good" psychological bent, or
his mind-set. You can hear him say after falling short in another
major, that he feels good about himself, that he had a good
experience, that everything is fine. It is this mental approach that
absolutely appalls Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Arnold Palmer. They
think Phil's way off base, that the only two places in a tournament
are first and loser.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson has chosen not to beat himself up. He has even said that
he's not like Tiger Woods and he doesn't think winning majors is the
most important factor in his life.</TE>
<TE>   Another theory is that Mickelson is out of shape. Yes, he's a
great natural talent, but it's a fact that Woods and David Duval, to
name a couple, are far more advanced in the weight, strength and
stamina departments.</TE>
<TE>   Other than being a talented guy, Phil the golfer is not without
his share of positive attributes. Mickelson has won 21
tournaments--only 25 players in the history of golf have won
more--and he's only 32. Ben Hogan was 34 when he won his first major,
the 1946 PGA Championship, and he went on to win eight more.</TE>
<TE>   So you would have to say that time hasn't run out on Mickelson.
But still, wouldn't you figure that in 42 tries, he might just have
stumbled into a major title?</TE>
<TE>   He was in the hunt at the Masters and wound up third when Woods
won. He was also in contention at Bethpage Black in the U.S. Open and
was second to Woods. He had back-to-back rounds of 76 at the British
Open and tied for 66th, which brought us to Hazeltine, where once
again he won't win.</TE>
<TE>   Look at all the one-shot wonders of late who aren't Mickelson's
equal in talent, but are still major championship winners, guys like
Bob Tway, Hal Sutton, Mark Brooks, Jeff Sluman, Paul Lawrie, Corey
Pavin, Steve Jones and Paul Azinger.</TE>
<TE>   How can this happen? As Mickelson's streak grows, does it become
more and more difficult for him to end it? Why are there more
questions than answers?</TE>
<TE>   It's clear that Mickelson doesn't know. He has tried beating
himself up and easing up on himself. He has tried emphasizing majors
and attaching less importance to them. He has tried talking about
majors and clamming up.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson has come close. It took an 18-foot uphill putt on the
last hole of the last day of the 1999 U.S. Open for Payne Stewart to
beat him by a shot. And it took a hole in one on Saturday at the 2001
PGA Championship for David Toms to beat him by a shot.</TE>
<TE>   Someone else might decide it's time to try something radical.
Actually, that's what Woods and Nick Faldo did--they both broke down
their swings and completely changed them--after winning major
championships.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there's nothing wrong with Mickelson's swing. But something
is obviously missing. In the meantime, Phil continues to be a fan
favorite, for his sheepish, boyish grin; for signing autographs until
his hand hurts; for going for broke when it sometimes might be better
to pull back on the throttle.</TE>
<TE>   That's not Mickelson's way, though. And it might be hard to argue
about someone's lack of success when that person has made nearly $22
million, which is what Mickelson has banked.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the debate rages on and so does the streak, lengthening
as the shadows from the clubhouse fall across the 18th green on every
Sunday of every major and Mickelson still hasn't hoisted the trophy.
The streak moves on to 2003 now, and there will be four more tries
for Mickelson to end it before the questions become too burdensome,
the pressure too great and the expectations too hard to handle.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, though, there is no end in sight. Will the streak knock
Phil into a frenzy? Or will he climb into his Gulfstream II and not
worry about it?</TE>
<TE>   It's up to Phil. But then, it always has been.</TE>

<LD>Media guides are supposed to list facts and figures, quickly relay
information from past games or historic milestones, and, of course,
talk up the home school whenever possible. They are not necessarily
unbiased manuals, but then again, rarely do they convey opinions.</LD>
<LD>   Especially about opponents.</LD>
<LD>   Texas A&amp;M has caused a mighty stir by changing all of that. On
Page 226 of the 2002 Aggies' football media guide, a feature lifted
from an Aggie alumni magazine--headlined, "Worst Atmosphere"--puts an
interesting spin on events that occurred in the ugly aftermath of
Texas Tech's 12-0 victory over A&amp;M last season at Lubbock, where Tech
students tore down a goal post and tried to shove it into an A&amp;M fan
section, leading to numerous fights.</LD>
<TE>   According to a story in the Dallas Morning News, the media guide
section calls the Red Raiders "classless clowns," and the alumni
story also says Tech fans "were even uglier than the barren stretch
of dirt some West Texans call a city."</TE>
<TE>   Add Red Raiders: Word came Friday that Texas A&amp;M President Robert
Gates had sent a letter of apology to his counterpart at Texas Tech
for the disparaging remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to express my personal regret over the inclusion of
disparaging remarks about Texas Tech University and Lubbock in Texas
A&amp;M's football media guide," Gates wrote in a letter to Texas Tech
President David J. Schmidly.</TE>
<TE>   Gates said the media guide would be recalled and the "offensive
comments" removed before it was reissued.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech plays at Texas A&amp;M on Oct. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Since 1947, the Little League World Series, which
began Friday, has been won by teams from the United States 26 times.
Which country ranks second?</TE>
<TE>   Uplifting TV: Frank Fitzpatrick of the Philadelphia Inquirer has
been watching the HBO series on the Dallas Cowboys' training camp and
has this to say about owner Jerry Jones:</TE>
<TE>   "[Jones] had his face lifted last year.... If doctors can just
lower his profile and puncture his ego, there's a Nobel Prize
waiting."</TE>
<TE>   The latest line: Steve Rosenbloom in the Chicago Tribune, on ESPN
hiring fired Notre Dame football coach Bob Davie as an analyst: "ESPN
was immediately installed as a 14-point underdog to Fox Sports Net."</TE>
<TE>   Crowd control: Bill Lankhof of the Toronto Sun, on efforts to get
a wave going at Blue Jay games: "To do the wave properly, it is
necessary to actually have, oh, I don't know, a crowd. What we've got
now looks more like a couple of confused Canadians politely waving
their hands for permission from the ump to go potty."</TE>
<TE>   Overexposed? Bob Ryan in the Boston Globe: "Is it absolutely,
positively necessary to televise the entire Little League World
Series? And don't even ask about the wisdom of televising the
regional finals. Hey, why not a camera at next year's tryouts?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Taiwan with 17.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Midfielder Robbie Savage was found guilty of improper
conduct by the English Football Assn. for using the referee's toilet
before a Premier League game last April.</TE>
<TE>   The Welsh international was reprimanded, warned as to his future
conduct and fined $15,350 plus costs at the hearing called to
consider the matter.</TE>
<TE>   That's the ultimate pay toilet.</TE>

<HD>Brown Gives Dodgers Perspiration, Inspiration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With 21 of the Dodgers' 34 games after the All-Star break decided by
two runs or fewer, it became apparent to Manager Jim Tracy that his
plan to ease right-hander Kevin Brown back into form by pitching him
in low-stress situations would be virtually impossible.</LD>
<LD>   So Tracy threw Brown right into the fire Friday night, almost
literally--85-degree temperatures and high humidity turned Shea
Stadium into an inferno of sorts--and the results were mixed. Brown
labored through a 36-pitch seventh inning, giving up the go-ahead run
on Timo Perez's RBI single, but Marquis Grissom hit a two-run homer
in the top of the eighth, and Brown blanked the New York Mets in the
bottom of the eighth to key a 3-2 Dodger victory before 35,089.</LD>
<LD>   Brown's first career victory in relief extended the Dodgers' win
streak to three and moved them two games ahead of San Francisco in
the National League wild-card race. The Mets have lost six in a row
and nine straight in Shea, their longest home skid since 1979.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nice to get my feet wet, but it would have been nice if it
was a little easier," said Brown, who underwent surgery for a
herniated disk in his lower back June 11 and hadn't pitched since May
26. "I missed the strike zone too much. I hope it gets better."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who walked four and struck out one, escaped the seventh
when Mo Vaughn grounded to first with the bases loaded. His fastball
was in the 91-to 93-mph range, "but his ball was moving almost too
much," catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "He made maybe 10 pitches in the
seventh that were just off the plate. For him to be healthy and have
good stuff is a great sign for us."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers rallied in the eighth when Mark Grudzielanek, batting
leadoff for the first time this season, doubled off left-hander Mark
Guthrie and Grissom, who in his last 12 games is batting .410 (16 for
39) with four homers and 12 runs batted in, slammed Guthrie's first
pitch far over the wall in left for his 14th homer of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy hoped to avoid using closer Eric Gagne for a fourth
consecutive night, but his low pitch count--36 pitches the previous
three nights--and the tight score outweighed a need for rest.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy went to Gagne, only the second time this season he has
pitched four days in a row, and Gagne responded with a crisp,
one-two-three inning that included two strikeouts and resulted in his
42nd save, within two of Todd Worrell's franchise record.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a calculated decision, knowing how many pitches he made
the previous three days," Tracy said. "But you know what? His stuff
[Friday] was better than it was the last three days."</TE>
<TE>   Starter Hideo Nomo's stuff wasn't bad, either. He gave up one run
and four hits in six innings in an 84-pitch performance that so
drained him that he needed intravenous fluids afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo's only blemish was Ty Wigginton's homer in the second. The
Dodgers tied it in the fourth when Grissom and Shawn Green walked, Lo
Duca singled to left and Grissom scored on left fielder Roger
Cedeno's fielding error.</TE>
<TE>   New York's lineup looked more like Met Lite. Catcher Mike Piazza
(tendinitis in left wrist), second baseman Roberto Alomar (sore
feet), third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo (strained rib-cage muscle) and
right fielder Jeromy Burnitz (benched) were out, and Tony Tarasco hit
cleanup for the first time in his career.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The key issues in baseball's labor dispute:</LD>
<LD>   The sides essentially have agreed to have a committee study the
issue of a worldwide draft.</LD>
<LD>   Owners: Have proposed that the commissioner can take $85 million
from the central fund--where money goes from national broadcasting
and licensing contracts--and distribute it unequally to teams.
Because the money is to be taken equally from every team--$2.83
million each--at most $45 million could be transferred to the 14
teams with the least revenue.</LD>
<TE>*--*
AMATEUR DRAFT</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>*--*
COMMISSIONER'S DISCRETIONARY FUND</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Players: Have proposed moving $40 million unequally from the
central fund to the low-revenue teams.</TE>
<TE>*--*
COMPETITIVE-BALANCE DRAFT</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Owners: The teams with the eight highest winning percentages
during the previous three years would be able to protect 25 players
each in the draft. Only the teams with the eight lowest winning
percentages during the previous three years would be allowed to make
selections, and they could take only one player each. The draft would
take place annually, after the World Series but before the end of the
winter meetings each December.</TE>
<TE>   Players: Open to the concept.</TE>
<TE>*--*
CONTRACTION</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Owners: They claim they have the right to eliminate teams but must
bargain on the effects of eliminating teams, such as a dispersal
draft.</TE>
<TE>   Players: They claim franchises cannot be folded without the
union's approval. The union filed a grievance over the Nov. 6 vote.
That grievance is pending.</TE>
<TE>*--*
DRUG TESTING</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Both sides: Agreed to mandatory random drug testing for illegal
steroids, and also that there will not be mandatory random testing
for nutritional supplements such as the testosterone-booster
androstenedione, and for "recreational" drugs such as cocaine. Must
still agree to details of the program.</TE>
<TE>*--*
LUXURY TAX</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Owners: To slow salary growth, owners would like a luxury tax on
high-payroll teams. The tax would start in 2003 on the portions of
payrolls above $102 million (using average annual values of players
on 40-man rosters, and including $9 million in benefits). The tax
would be raised in 2005 and 2006 at a percentage matching the cost of
living if payroll disparity decreases the previous year. A team would
be taxed at 37.5% the first time it exceeded the threshold, 42.5% the
second time, 47.5% the third time and 50% the fourth time. The
previous labor contract called for a 35% tax in 1997 and 1998, and a
34% tax in 1999, levied on the portions of payrolls above the
midpoint of the fifth-highest payroll and sixth-highest payroll.
Because the payroll was not fixed, most owners concluded it was
ineffective, but the union claims it kept the highest spenders closer
to the other teams. Teams paid $12.1 million in 1997, $6.6 million in
1998 and $12 million in 1999, a total of $30.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Players: Proposed a tax threshold of $130 million in 2003, $140
million in 2004 and $150 million in 2005, with no tax in 2006. A team
would be taxed at 15% the first time it exceeded the threshold, 25%
the second time and 30% the third time.</TE>
<TE>*--*
MINIMUM PAYROLLS</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Owners: Proposed a $45-million minimum payroll (including 40-man
rosters and benefits), to address concerns that owners may keep
additional revenue-sharing money. Only Montreal and Tampa Bay were
below that this season.</TE>
<TE>   Players: As opposed to payroll floors as they are to payroll
ceilings.</TE>
<TE>*--*
REVENUE SHARING</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Owners: Hoping to decrease revenue disparity, they have proposed
increasing revenue sharing, which began in 1996. Under the current
system, called a split-pool plan, each team contributes 20% of its
net local revenue, after deductions for ballpark expenses, to a pool.
Seventy-five percent of the pool is redistributed equally to all 30
teams, and 25% is redistributed only to the teams with local revenue
below the major league average. Owners first proposed that each team
contribute 50% of its net local revenue, after deductions for
ballpark expenses, to a pool that would be redistributed equally to
all 30 teams. Using 2001 figures, the amount of shared money would
increase from $167 million to $298 million.</TE>
<TE>   Players: First proposed continuing the split-pool plan and having
each team contribute 22.5% of its net local revenue, after deductions
for ballpark expenses. Using 2001 figures, the amount of shared money
would increase to $228 million. The sides say they think they are
close to an agreement on revenue sharing, but the union says it must
be in conjunction with a luxury-tax agreement.</TE>
<TE>*--*
SALARY ARBITRATION</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Owners: Would eliminate salary arbitration eligibility of "Super
Twos"--the top 17%, by service time, of those players with two or
more years but less than three years of major league service. In the
1985 contract, the eligibility of players with two or more but less
than three years of major league service was eliminated. Eligibility
for the "Super Twos"--approximately 12 each year--was restored in the
1990 contract and left unchanged in the 1997 contract. Owners also
want to be able to withdraw contract offers to players after salary
arbitration figures are exchanged each Jan. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Players: Oppose changes.</TE>

<HD>Union's Clock Is Ticking</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Both sides express frustration and disappointment
as Aug. 30 deadline is set. Payroll tax is still the heart of the
problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID and ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Major League Baseball Players Assn. Friday moved closer to
shutting down the sport for the ninth time in 30 years, setting an
Aug. 30 strike deadline that disappointed management and further
strained a process stalled on the core issue of a payroll tax.</LD>
<LD>   The union's executive board voted to approve the walkout date with
the sides entrenched at opposite extremes on the salary-restraint
tool management deems essential to establish competitive balance,
trying to spur completion of a new collective bargaining agreement
before the regular season ends.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations hit a wall Wednesday because the union considered
management's counterproposal to its payroll tax offer unacceptable,
resulting in the strike date that could wipe out the World Series for
the second time in nine years and affect the 2003 season. The 1994
strike lasted 232 days.</LD>
<TE>   Owners have said they would not initiate a work stoppage this
season, vowing not to lock out players through the World Series, but
they could unilaterally implement new work rules after the postseason
is completed. The union, fearful of being locked out as NBA players
were after the 1998 season, played its main bargaining chip.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we want to do the right thing for the game, for the
fans, it's just sometimes you have to make decisions," said Shawn
Green, one of 10 Dodgers who attended the meeting at the union's
Manhattan offices before a game against the New York Mets at Shea
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're backed into a corner, you have to make the right
decisions. No one wants a strike. If it happens, it happens. It's not
something we're looking forward to."</TE>
<TE>   Players weighed the Sept. 11 issue in setting a date, saying they
are sensitive to the role baseball played in helping the United
States heal after the terrorist attacks. However, their bargaining
concerns superseded that matter.</TE>
<TE>   "As baseball players, we don't control what goes on," Met first
baseman Mo Vaughn said. "We couldn't control what happened on Sept.
11 last year, and we couldn't control that our deal is up this year."</TE>
<TE>   Although management and players continued to express hope of
reaching a deal that would avert another work stoppage, they
acknowledged the payroll tax issue has been a formidable hurdle. The
sides plan to resume negotiations today and still have two weeks to
resolve their major differences, but now they're working against a
clock.</TE>
<TE>   "The players wouldn't have made this decision lightly," union head
Don Fehr said on a conference call. "It comes after a lot of thought,
a lot of bargaining and weighing of the issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We are simply not in a situation in which we can go into an
off-season without an agreement. We need a contract before the year
is out, and we think this is the best way to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Owners disagreed. They wanted the union to give negotiators a few
more days, hoping it would again postpone setting a date after taking
no action during an executive board meeting Monday in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "They apparently felt that the addition of a strike date would
create more pressure," said Rob Manfred, baseball's lead labor
lawyer. "In all honesty, I don't think we feel a lot different today
than we felt yesterday.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to get an agreement. We feel it's important to get
an agreement as quickly as possible."</TE>
<TE>   As late as Tuesday, Manfred believed an agreement could be reached
"in the next several days," characterizing the process
optimistically. But the mood changed Wednesday when management
presented its latest tax proposal, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the union offer, the minimum payroll subject to being taxed
would be $130 million in 2003, $140 million in 2004 and $150 million
in 2005, at which point the tax would end. The tax would be assessed
at a rate of 15% for clubs above the threshold once, 25% twice and
30% three times.</TE>
<TE>   Based on projections, the New York Yankees are the only team that
would be affected by the tax next season. That's unacceptable to
owners, insisting that the next agreement includes a viable mechanism
to slow escalating player salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, only seven of 30 teams exceeded $140 million total
revenue in 2001, meaning it's doubtful many clubs would ever be
subjected to a payroll tax of $140 million or more.</TE>
<TE>   "That's inconsistent with all the things that we're trying to
accomplish," baseball President Bob DuPuy said, "which is a
compression of the ratio from top to bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Under the owners' proposal, a team would be taxed at 37.5% the
first time it exceeded the threshold, 42.5% the second time, 47.5%
the third time and 50% the fourth time. The previous labor contract
called for a 35% tax in 1997 and 1998, and a 34% tax in 1999, levied
on the portions of payrolls above the midpoint of the fifth-highest
payroll and sixth-highest payroll. Teams paid $12.1 million in 1997,
$6.6 million in 1998 and $12 million in 1999, a total of $30.6
million.</TE>
<TE>   Management adopted the union tax-rate formula, but increased the
threshold only $4 million--to $102 million--from its starting figure.
The minimal movement was greeted with anger from the union.</TE>
<TE>   "We were extraordinarily disappointed with the proposals they
made," Fehr said. "The proposal was of a kind that, not only could we
not accept, but the owners' negotiators knew from the beginning that
our reaction would be one of deep disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   Owners similarly expressed frustration about the union stance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why Don reacted the way he did," Manfred said.
"Quite frankly, we thought we made a proposal that would continue the
process. Did we think that they were going to jump up and down and
say, 'Let me sign here?' Maybe not. But we thought it would continue
the process.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the last proposal with respect to the luxury tax. Not
only did we make the last proposal, we then met with them after that
and expressed our desire to compromise and move the process forward.
What they told us is they have nothing more to say on the topic.
Those are the facts."</TE>
<TE>   The union views a payroll tax-revenue sharing combination as a
salary cap by another name.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt, it's come down to a luxury tax," Met pitcher Al
Leiter said. "Is it used to create competitive balance, or to be
disguised as a salary cap?</TE>
<TE>   "A cap is not what we're looking for. We think there's a number in
the threshold that can be worked with."</TE>
<TE>   Management believes players are misinformed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important for people to understand that just because
someone, player or otherwise, runs around and says this amounts to a
salary cap, that doesn't make it true," Manfred said. "You need to
look at the facts ... and the things that we're seeking in this
agreement are not revolutionary."</TE>
<TE>   The union views payroll tax as a component of revenue sharing,
another means of transferring money from high-revenue to low-revenue
clubs, maintaining they work in conjunction only to redistribute
revenue. The union is prepared to make further concessions in revenue
sharing, but not unless owners abandon their proposal for a payroll
tax that would affect many teams.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about taking very substantial sums of money away
from a number of clubs, and transferring those to other clubs," Fehr
said. "There's no doubt that revenue sharing is a considerable drag
on players' salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "We have moved very substantially in their direction on revenue
sharing, but their proposal, at this point, still retains a luxury
tax. The luxury tax is troublesome on its own. When it's added on top
of the substantial revenue sharing, it becomes [more] difficult to
deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Owners and players are committed to sticking with their tax views,
casting a shadow over the rest of the season and further alienating
fans as the fight continues.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand the fans' point of view, and I know both sides
will be calling each other out, and can understand their
frustrations," said Paul Lo Duca, the Dodger player representative.
"We just want something in the middle."</TE>

Work Stoppages
1972 STRIKE
April 1-12; Games lost: 86
* Key move: Owners agreed to binding salary arbitration
* Lasting effect: Union boss Marvin Miller became the most powerful
man in baseball and his players were never again afraid to strike
1973 LOCKOUT
Feb. 8-25; Games lost: 0, camps opened late; season started on time
* Key move: Owners increased minimum salary from $13,500 to $15,000
* Lasting effect: Three years of peace, but the free-agency issue was
looming
1976 LOCKOUT
March 1-17; Games lost: 0
* Key move: A federal judge ruled that pitchers Andy Messersmith and
Dave McNally were free agents and able to negotiate with any team
* Lasting effect: A four-year deal was brokered and the issue of
controlling salaries was on the way to becoming a major concern for
owners
1980 STRIKE
April 1-8; Games lost: 0, final eight days of spring training lost,
but season started on time
* Key move: A four-year deal was made but with a clause allowing free
agency to be revisited in 1981
* Lasting effect: An incomplete agreement opened the door for another
stoppage
1981 STRIKE
June 1-July 31; Games lost: 712, resulting in a split-season format
* Key move: The owners, hoping to curtail free agency, asked that
draft picks be used as compensation to a team losing a player

established that continue to this day
1990 LOCKOUT
Feb. 15-March 18; Games lost: 0

Vincent was sacked and the owners install one of their own, Bud Selig
1994-95 STRIKE
Aug. 12-March 31; Games lost: 938
* Key move: The owners planned to let their current agreement expire
and then force a salary cap on the players. The union struck rather
than accept unilateral changes. The courts ordered the players back
to work under the terms of the expired agreement. A new agreement was
signed on March 14, 1997, and the term luxury tax became a part of
baseball
* Lasting effect: For the first time since 1904 there was no World
Series. Salaries have remained unchecked and the gap between
baseball's "haves" and "have-nots" has widened

<LD>Here's my message to the owners, who are certainly no angels, but
whom I'll side with any day of the week over a group of unrealistic,
overpaid, swelled heads who live in Fantasyland and clearly don't get
it and whose average salary is an obscene $2.4 million: Break them!
If they strike, do whatever it takes to break the union, and start
from scratch. Enough is enough.</LD>

<TE>   "Everybody is a winner if we can get through this thing without
setting a strike date," Colorado's Larry Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   Memo to Larry Walker: "Everybody" but the fans. Frankly I think I
can speak for many of us fans who are completely disgusted by having
yet another strike date hung over our heads. We've felt that way
since '94 when the World Series was taken from us.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, my disgust with the game of baseball as it is today
goes beyond the players and owners. Lately, I am getting disgusted by
the fans as well. Why do fans, including myself, continue to support
this game that ultimately belongs to us?</TE>
<TE>   With a little organization, we could set our own strike date,
complete with demands such as revenue sharing.</TE>
<TE>   Once every ballpark in America starts looking like Olympic and Pro
Player Stadiums on a good night and television ratings go down to
"Joanie Loves Chachi" rerun levels, we'll see who's the real boss. Is
it us (the fans?) or is it Larry Walker, Bud Selig and George
Steinbrenner?</TE>
<TE>   I think it's time for us fans to unite. Are there any of us out
there who want to step up to the plate?</TE>

<TE>   There may be a deal and no strike. But at whose expense? I took my
family to Dodger Stadium a week ago and paid $50 for four
cheeseburgers, four orders of fries--in the paper cups, not the
souvenir helmets--and four drinks at Carl's Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Now I'm all for free enterprise, and I have no problem paying a
small premium for ballpark food, but 50 bucks for what would
ordinarily cost me about 20 outside of the stadium? You guys lost me
after the '94 strike, and it wasn't until recently that I came back
to the game.</TE>
<TE>   As you settle your differences, bear in mind that for many of us,
it is just getting too expensive to support the game. If the solution
to your present differences is to raise ticket and concession prices,
resharpen your pencils and figure out another solution or you'll lose
me all over again.</TE>

<TE>   Please tell me Angel pitcher Scott Schoeneweis is not as naive as
his comments about steroid use in baseball made him sound (Angel
Report, Aug. 11).</TE>
<TE>   If he is just spouting the union line that is one thing, but if he
really believes the problem "could just go away" he is beyond naive.
Schoeneweis opines that 5% or 3% of players using steroids doesn't
seem like a problem to him, but 40% would be. Where is the cutoff,
Scott? Ten percent? Fifteen percent? Schoeneweis' stance further
illustrates how far major league players are removed from reality and
the feelings of baseball fans.</TE>

<LD>It is both ironic and disgraceful that at a time our city was
honoring the memory of a man so celebrated for, among other things,
his amazing ability to show up, Jerry Buss and Shaquille O'Neal chose
not to show up for his memorial service.</LD>
<LD>   While thousands of fans filed through the Staples Center, and
friends, family and colleagues expressed their respect and affection
for Chick Hearn in Brentwood, Buss and O'Neal were nowhere to be
found.</LD>
<LD>   For 42 years, Chick gave his heart and soul to this city and to
the Laker organization. Players, coaches, even owners came and went,
but Chick was always there. Chick always showed up. He lost not one,
but both of his children, and he showed up. He fought through bouts
of laryngitis and who knows what other illnesses and injuries, but he
showed up. He suffered a heart attack and a broken hip, and although
it took a little while, he showed up. And we can only imagine the
times during that streak of 3,338 consecutive games that he must have
just not felt like being there. But still, he showed up.</LD>
<TE>   As for Buss and O'Neal, whatever their excuses are, they are
simply not acceptable. Chick never made excuses. He just showed up.</TE>

(billed as "The House that Jordan Built") then how much more does
Chickie deserve an equal or greater honor?</TE>

( and the Lakers' ) decision to wait so long to decide on surgery
that it will cause him to sit out the entire preseason as well as the
first eight-10 games of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Am I the only one who thinks that because he is getting paid for a
full season of basketball, he should do all that is possible to play
a full season?</TE>
<TE>   Now that the decision has been made to have surgery, it is being
put off for another two weeks. Unbelievable! No one seems to be
making an issue of this decision. Does the fact that he has led the
Lakers to three championships give him carte blanche to do anything
he pleases? Why ruin his entire summer off by having to rehabilitate
his toe? Is his personal enjoyment more important than the rest of
the team?</TE>

<TE>   Let's just admit it. The NBA regular season is a sham. Just ask

<TE>   There's no doubt Shaq has admirably played in pain for quite a
while, but his decision to wait more than two months after the close
of the playoffs to have surgery is symptomatic of how little the
millionaire NBA players care about the regular season. The NBA
playoffs consist of hustling, hard-nosed basketball. By comparison,
the 82-game regular season is a shoot-around.</TE>

<HD>Should Bobby Bowden Be a 'Roll' Model?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>By using "Let's roll" as his Seminoles' 2002 motto, Coach Bobby
Bowden demeans the sacrifice made by Todd Beamer and others who
prevented the Sept. 11 crash into another populated building. Beamer
knew that his life was coming to an end. He wasn't trying to win some
football game. He wasn't trying to break some beer-chugging record at
a tailgate party.</LD>
<LD>   Todd Beamer's wife told him that someone was crashing planes, and
he took decisive action. "Let's roll" is a life-and-death utterance
of ultimate human dignity. It should never be used in a frivolous
manner. The only people who can use it legitimately are people who
are risking their lives going into deadly battle. Somebody should
tell Bobby Bowden what those words really mean.</LD>

<TE>   I think the furor over Bobby Bowden and "Let's roll" is only
slightly sillier than Jim Bowden's fine for his comments regarding
the baseball strike date. The best choice of words? No. Insensitive
and outrageous? No again.</TE>
<TE>   We bemoan the fact that sports are too businesslike and that they
aren't fun anymore. Then we crucify the guys who are trying to keep
it fun with over-the-line comments. It won't be long before every GM,
coach and athlete will be so afraid to be politically incorrect that
they will all be as interesting to watch as Bud Selig explaining why
a tie in the All-Star game is a good thing.</TE>

<TE>   John invited me for lunch. I gave him a copy of the book. He told
me that his father, Clif Argue, had been a pentathlete at the 1924
Paris Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   My father wrote "An Approved History of the Olympic Games" in
1933, published it in 1948 and donated the proceeds to the USOC to
send athletes to the London Games. John said maybe we should update
the book. He said he needed something to give to the IOC and USOC as
part of the bid. I gathered four Occidental graduates who had been to
various Olympics, assigned each one a chapter, and we wrote the book
in 1976. Some 5,000 copies were published.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979 David Puttnam, a movie producer, read about Eric Liddell
and Harold Abrahams competing in the 1924 Paris Games in the Bill
Henry book, and "Chariots of Fire" was made. It won four Academy
Awards, including best picture of 1981.</TE>
<TE>   John was almost like a younger brother to me since 1972, 30 years
of sharing the Olympic dream I will treasure forever.</TE>

<LD>Andre Patterson, UCLA sophomore forward, is expected to be ruled
academically ineligible for the fall quarter and must sit out at
least the first three basketball games next season, according to
sources.</LD>
<LD>   Patterson, a key reserve as a freshman, is in summer school
attempting to gain eligibility for the winter quarter. Although he
has reportedly considered transferring, Patterson has told Bruin
coaches he wants to remain at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA spokesman Marc Dellins would not comment, saying the academic
status of students is confidential. A determination would not be made
officially until the first day of the fall quarter in late September.
Patterson moved to L.A. from Indiana before his senior year of high
school and attended Washington Prep in hopes of being recruited by
UCLA. As a freshman, he shot 50% and was second on the team with 18
blocked shots, averaging 2.3 points and 2.1 rebounds in nine minutes
a game.</LD>

windy quarterfinal match at Montreal. Hingis was playing her first
tournament since May, when she had surgery for damaged ligaments in
her left knee. She also had surgery on the right ankle in October.
Dokic will face second-seeded Jennifer Capriati, a 4-6, 6-0, 6-2

<HD>Avoiding Bonds Is Key for Marlins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Florida Marlin fans booed the strategy, then cheered the result.</LD>
<LD>   Rookie left-hander Michael Tejera pitched out of jams by pitching
around Barry Bonds three times Friday night, and Florida beat the San
Francisco Giants, 4-2, Friday at Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds saw only one strike in his first three at-bats, each with at
least one runner on base. The crowd jeered, but each time Tejera
(8-5) escaped without further damage.</LD>
<TE>   "That's the guy you don't want to beat you, so I pitched around
him, and it worked," Tejera said. "With guys on base, I walk him
every time."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds swung for the only time in the seventh, lining a 3-0 pitch
from Vladimir Nunez for an RBI single. Bonds hasn't homered since
becoming the fourth player to reach the 600 milestone Aug. 9 against
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Kevin Millar again feasted on Kirk Rueter (10-7),
driving in two runs with a homer and a single. Millar was five for
five lifetime against the left-hander with three homers and six RBIs
before flying out to the warning track in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants managed seven hits on little sleep. They reached their
hotel at 5:30 a.m. Friday following a long night in Atlanta, which
ended with a 3-3 tie after a 2 1/2-hour rain delay in the 10th
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Braden Looper pitched a perfect ninth for his sixth save in nine
chances. Jeff Kent grounded out to end the game with Bonds on deck.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 9, Houston 3--Austin Kearns hit his first homer in two
months and Barry Larkin emerged from a slump by driving in three runs
to lead the Reds at Cincinnati. Brian Moehler (2-2) had his best
start since the Reds got him in a July 23 trade, giving up an
unearned run and four hits in seven innings. It was the first time in
15 games that a Red starter lasted seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds stopped a three-game losing streak without Ken Griffey
Jr., who sat out because of a sore left thigh that he aggravated
while chasing a ball in the outfield. He is expected back in the
lineup in a couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, St. Louis 0--Randy Wolf pitched a four-hitter and
Travis Lee hit a three-run homer as the Phillies won at Philadelphia
to stop St. Louis' six-game winning streak. Scott Rolen, playing his
first game in Philadelphia since he was traded to the Cardinals on
July 29, went two for four and made an error. The All-Star third
baseman received boos from the crowd of 31,117 at Veterans Stadium
each time he came to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Colorado 1--Chipper Jones hit a two-run homer and Kevin
Millwood won for the 10th time in 11 starts, limiting the Rockies to
only five hits in eight innings, to help the Braves win at Atlanta.
John Smoltz struck out Juan Uribe for his 43rd save in 47 chances
after loading the bases with two out in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 11, San Diego 6--Pinch-hitter Matt Cepicky's first career
home run sparked a four-run seventh inning for the Expos, who won at
Montreal despite losing All-Star Vladimir Guerrero to a shoulder
injury. The Expos ended San Diego's three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 10, Pittsburgh 3--Jose Hernandez hit a three-run homer
to lead a 15-hit attack for the Brewers, who won at Pittsburgh to
hand the Pirates their seventh consecutive loss.</TE>

<HD>Cohen Is Seeking Ice Time, Expertise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enticed by the prospect of having nearly unlimited ice time and the
expertise of coaches Tatiana Tarasova and Nikolai Morozov, Sasha
Cohen said Friday leaving Southern California to train in Newington,
Conn., offers her the best chance to realize her Olympic ambitions.</LD>
<LD>   "It has always been my dream to be an Olympic medalist," said
Cohen, twice a runner-up at the U.S. Championships and fourth at the
Salt Lake City Games. "Tatiana Tarasova has made that come true for a
lot of skaters. Hopefully, she can make my dreams come true as well."</LD>
<LD>   Cohen, 17, was coached by veteran John Nicks the last six years in
Costa Mesa and Aliso Viejo. Blessed with remarkable flexibility and
innate musicality, Cohen developed into a charismatic performer,
although not immune to technical lapses.</LD>
<TE>   Nicks portrayed her as headstrong but privately acknowledged
enjoying their give-and-take relationship. He did not return calls
for comment, but Cohen said he offered to help her if she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "They never had a problem on the ice," said her mother, Galina.
"The only problem was the rink. There's nobody to blame. Aliso Viejo
is just a public facility. If you owned skates, you could get on the
ice for the same session as Sasha."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said she considered a switch after she had worked with
Tarasova and Morozov on programs for next season and saw quick
improvement.</TE>
<TE>   After a discussion, her parents and younger sister decided to
leave their Laguna Niguel home and join her. "Just being in an elite
training environment with a lot of great skaters will give me ideas,"
said Cohen, who hopes to add triple-triple combination jumps to her
repertoire while again trying to become the first female skater to
land a quadruple jump. "I reached a point where I need a more
structured and intense training environment."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Several potential buyers have expressed interest in continuing to
operate the Ice Castle complex in Lake Arrowhead as a skating
facility, Ice Castle publicist Cindy Lang said. The camp portion of
the property is in escrow.</TE>

<HD>Weather Makes Things a Little Funky at PGA</HD>
<DH>Golf: Second round halted with Funk in lead with five holes
to play. Poor conditions expected today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>If you had to sum up the first two days of the 84th PGA Championship
in two words?</LD>
<LD>   Storm warning.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad, really, because Fred Funk was on Cloud 9.</LD>
<TE>   For the second time in two days Friday, thunderstorms suspended
play at Hazeltine National Golf Club with players on course and story
lines on hold.</TE>
<TE>   Second-round play was halted at 6:21 p.m., then officially called
for the day at 6:38, in advance of an approaching storm that carried
with it heavy rain, damaging wind and dangerous lightning.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-one players were left on course and were scheduled to resume
their rounds this morning, before the start of third-round play.</TE>
<TE>   The 46-year-old Funk, who shared the first-round lead with Jim
Furyk, was defying his age and having the time of his life when the
weather horn sounded. It was almost like a parent having to call a
kid inside for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a little adrenaline going," Funk said. "I was having fun,
enjoying being in the lead of the PGA."</TE>
<TE>   Funk was at seven under par with five holes to play when he ducked
for cover, one shot ahead of Mark Calcavecchia, Justin Leonard, Rich
Beem and Retief Goosen, all of whom were in the clubhouse at
six-under 138 after completing sun-shiny rounds earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods had tapped in for par with two holes left when play
was halted. He stands at three under, four shots behind Funk.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Mickelson, winless in 41 previous majors, is a safe bet to
make it 42 after playing the first two days at four-over 148 with
rounds of 76-72.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson finished play Friday with a double bogey at the par-four
ninth, which nearly left him speechless.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what else to say," he said. "It's not like I feel
like I'm playing horrific. I'm certainly not scoring well."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of challenging the leaders, Mickelson spent the evening
wondering whether he would be playing over the weekend. It appeared
before play was stopped that the cut would break at plus-four, which
would leave Mickelson in the tournament, if not in contention.</TE>
<TE>   Funk, in the meantime, got as low as eight under when he made a
15-foot birdie putt at the par-five third hole, thrusting his fist in
the air after the ball rolled in.</TE>
<TE>   Funk gave a shot back on the next hole, pulling his putt after a
nice sand shot to within two feet, yet this "boo-boo," as he called
it, did not curb his enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   Funk, surprisingly, has not been disadvantaged by his advanced
golf age and lack of distance off the tee.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out Hazeltine National is not quite the monster it was
touted to be.</TE>
<TE>   Although technically a long course at 7,630 yards, a lot of that
distance is masked in the four par-five holes, one of which measures
636 yards.</TE>
<TE>   It helps to explain how Funk, one of the shortest drivers on the
PGA Tour, could be hanging with some of golf's biggest sluggers.</TE>
<TE>   Is it possible Funk, who has never won a major, can win this one?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I could," he said. "Obviously, I've got to keep the putter
going but, yeah, I could sneak in there and win one on this golf
course, if the stars are lined up."</TE>
<TE>   Any way you look at it, golfers will be casting eyes toward the
heavens.</TE>
<TE>   As they say at the Weather Channel, stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   If you believe the weather synopsis, today's third-round could be
a repeat of Round 3 at the British Open. Yep, the round in which
Woods shot himself out of the Grand Slam with an 81.</TE>
<TE>   The gale that tore through Minneapolis on Friday night is supposed
to leave in its wake wind gusts of 40 mph, which could turn today's
leaderboard upside down.</TE>
<TE>   It might be a great day for fans who love to see their stars
suffer and struggle like 18-handicappers.</TE>
<TE>   "People like to see train wrecks," Funk mused. "You're going to
see a lot of train wrecks out there."</TE>
<TE>   It could also, of course, give Woods a chance to make amends for
his mess-up at Muirfield.</TE>
<TE>   No one could deny Friday's leaderboard was eclectic.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard, Calcavecchia and Goosen have won major championships,
although only Goosen has won recently--last year's U.S. Open at
Southern Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Calcavecchia, who won the British Open in 1989, shot four-under 68
on Friday, yet offered no inkling he was headed for a major upswing.
He missed the cut at the Masters and U.S. Open and finished tied for
80th at the British. He has been in the news recently only for
calling Mickelson "a big goof," in Golf Digest.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's what people like to read," Calcavecchia said,
"Instead of the usual BS you hear from athletes."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard, the kid from Texas who won the 1997 British Open, is no
kid anymore at 30. Another short hitter, Leonard has spent much of
the season reworking his swing in order to keep up with the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard's 66 on Friday suggests he may be ready for a reawakening.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen, who opened play here with consecutive rounds of 69,
appears a strong and confident man in majors, so long as Woods isn't
challenging.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, really the only chance the other players have got is
when he's not really in contention," Goosen said.</TE>
<TE>   Beem, 31, is the oddball of the group, a former car stereo
salesman who decided to give the PGA Tour a whirl after failing
miserably as an assistant club pro at El Paso Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   Beem explained: "I could do one thing very well, like, if you
wanted me to fill out scorecards or do something for a tournament, I
could do that. But give me three or four things to do, forget about
it. I was lost."</TE>
<TE>   Beem, who birdied the last hole after his tee shot went well right
and his approach shot scooted to within a few feet, joined the PGA
Tour in 1999 and has won twice, at the 1999 Kemper Open and this
year's International.</TE>
<TE>   On the course, Beem swigs Pepto Bismol to calm his stomach and
easily had the most descriptive rundown of his best hole--a birdie on
No. 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit my drive way left over in the Porta Potti area and hit an
eight-iron on the front edge and chipped that in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, winning the PGA Championship would be thrilling beyond
words.</TE>
<TE>   Because?</TE>
<TE>   "You get a lot of cool stuff if you win this thing," Beem said.</TE>

<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>You could almost feel Tom Dolby's pain.</LD>
<LD>   What should have been one of the highlights of his life in front
of a hometown crowd turned into golfing disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Dolby, a 40-year-old club pro from Greystone Golf Club in Sauk
Centre, Minn., shot a 22-over-par 94 in Friday's second round,
leaving him at 35-over 179 through 36 rounds.</LD>
<TE>   Dolby shot an 85 in the opening round.</TE>
<TE>   Dolby had a good excuse, his back was killing him, yet he decided
to play through the pain.</TE>
<TE>   "I had all my family and in-laws coming in," Dolby said. "I guess
my pride got in the way. I should have just withdrawn."</TE>
<TE>   Dolby qualified by finishing tied for 12th in the 2002 PGA Club
Professional Championship. The top 25 finishers earned berths into
the PGA.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Dolby shot in the 90s?</TE>
<TE>   "Seventh grade, eighth grade--I don't know," he said. "Those are
by far my worst two rounds ever in competition that I can remember."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Calcavecchia is happy to be playing well again, especially
with next month's Ryder Cup approaching.</TE>
<TE>   Calcavecchia said Ryder Cup captain Curtis Strange told him last
year that he had to pick up his game.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'You'd better get off your butt and start playing good,
otherwise you'll be riding the pine,' " Calcavecchia said.</TE>
<TE>   Strange, by the way, shot 81-76.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Justin Leonard, Rich Beem and Robert Allenby all shot six-under 66
on Friday to tie the competitive course record at Hazeltine.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard, for one, was not exactly thrilled when informed of the
news.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't give any bonus money," Leonard said. "I'm sorry, but
it doesn't make a big difference to me."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard might be one of the only golfers in the PGA who is looking
forward to more bad weather. He thinks the conditions are too easy
for a major tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather see par be a good score," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There has been electricity in the air all week, but it has nothing
to do with golf. Lightning storms suspended play in the first and
second rounds and more bad weather may be in store.</TE>
<TE>   This is serious business for players such as Retief Goosen, who
survived a lightning strike as an amateur player in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen, though, says he is not haunted by the experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't bother me," he said. "I'm pretty similar to any other
player. I think I don't feel comfortable when there's lightning out
there. You want to get into the clubhouse or somewhere where it's
safe. Luckily, it doesn't give me nightmares or things like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One day after David Toms said he didn't belong in the same group
with Tiger Woods and Ernie Els, Toms says he really did. What he
meant to say was that he didn't belong with them "physically."</TE>
<TE>   Toms said he was referring to the fact that it was impossible to
measure up with Woods and Els in the power department, "week in and
week out" when length off the tee was the only consideration.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was not a good day for David Duval, who shot a 77 and wasn't
happy about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just killing me," he said. "More of the same, frustration."</TE>
<TE>   Duval says he hasn't been able to take his play from the range
onto the course.</TE>
<TE>   Duval missed the cut at the Masters and the U.S. Open and tied for
22nd at the British Open.</TE>

<LD>They'll scream at an umpire to improve their batting average.</LD>
<LD>   They'll curse at a reporter to protect their reputation.</LD>
<LD>   Yet when it's time to say something about saving their sport,
baseball players are silent.</LD>
<TE>   They'll charge the mound when an opponent has bruised them.</TE>
<TE>   They'll kick a water cooler when fate has wronged them.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when it's time to put a headlock on a strike that could ruin
their game, baseball players will not lift a finger.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Friday's setting of a strike date has affected our
swaggering, glaring friends like a Randy Johnson fastball.</TE>
<TE>   Seven-hundred and fifty strapping men turned to mush.</TE>
<TE>   Cubs and Tigers and Marlins and Blue Jays transformed into sheep.</TE>
<TE>   The union has announced that, on Aug. 30, barring a new labor
settlement, it will abandon a game in which the average player makes
$2.4 million per year for sweating an average of 2.4 hours per day.</TE>
<TE>   The most luxuriously treated athletes in sports are threatening to
walk out in opposition of a luxury tax.</TE>
<TE>   This is stupid.</TE>
<TE>   Many players agree this is stupid.</TE>
<TE>   Why can't one of them just say it?</TE>
<TE>   We know baseball has great leaders, guys who can inspire
clubhouses and create championships, guys like Derek Jeter and
Chipper Jones and Luis Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Where is that leadership now?</TE>
<TE>   We know baseball has great "gamers," guys unafraid to go head
first into a base or a wall, guys like Darin Erstad and Torii Hunter
and Craig Biggio.</TE>
<TE>   Why won't they get their feet dirty now?</TE>
<TE>   Come to think of it, where is Gary Sheffield when you need him? He
complains about everything, doesn't he? He's not afraid to rip
anything, is he?</TE>
<TE>   Why isn't that dog barking now?</TE>
<TE>   The baseball union is again showing why it is the most powerful
sports organization on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   It has gathered hundreds of players who can't agree on how to wear
their socks and convinced them to march single file, blindfolded, off
a cliff.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about history lessons," said Matt Young, former Dodger
pitcher and union activist during his 11-year major league career.
"The union does a phenomenal job of talking history to the younger
players, year after year, telling them about the sacrifices older
players have made for them."</TE>
<TE>   Young said it starts in minor league spring training, when union
leaders meet with lowly prospects and treat them with the respect not
offered by their bosses.</TE>
<TE>   "My first spring training, they came into a room where only 10% of
the people will make the major leagues, and yet they talked to us
like major leaguers, telling us about other players who have fought
for us and how we should all stick together," Young recalled. "As a
young kid, I was blown away."</TE>
<TE>   It continues at the major league level, where, because of the
longer career span, the baseball union has an advantage over the
weaker basketball and football unions.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a veteran in the room to remind the younger
players that they wouldn't be making this kind of money if somebody
had not gone on strike for them," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   Young remembers one such labor meeting in 1985, when he was
pitching for the Seattle Mariners in a series in Anaheim against the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Angels were filled with veterans, while the Mariners
were mostly kids, the union requested that both teams meet together.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all sitting there not really sure what was going on until
Reggie Jackson stood up," Young recalled. "He started talking about
how much money he would lose in a strike, about how much he was
willing to give up for the rest of us. Jackson said, 'Somebody had
the courage to do it for me, so I have the courage to do it for you.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Added Young: "I'll never forget those words."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, that day, the teams voted for a strike.</TE>
<TE>   But it's different now. The players are no longer fighting to be
treated with decency. That fight has been long since won.</TE>
<TE>   The players are now fighting for ... what, exactly?</TE>
<TE>   To keep from losing a couple of jewels from their heavy crown? To
keep from losing anything to the owners, period?</TE>
<TE>   Here's guessing that some of them aren't sure, but are afraid to
ask.</TE>
<TE>   "The union never tells the players what to say, or ask them to be
puppets," Young said. "They just give examples of how, every time a
player says something that doesn't totally support the union,
negotiations can get set back two weeks because management thinks
we're going to break.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to be the knucklehead to say that wrong thing."</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't call that person a knucklehead. I would call him a
hero.</TE>
<TE>   The fight here no longer belongs to the players, but the game
itself.</TE>
<TE>   It is a fight to become a competitive sport again, a believable
sport again.</TE>
<TE>   It is a fight to reclaim the hearts of folks in small markets who
give up every April because their team clearly has no money and no
chance. It is a fight to make our former national pastime more, well,
national.</TE>
<TE>   Purists hate to hear this, but it is a fight to make baseball more
like football.</TE>
<TE>   It is certainly not a fight that can be won by walking away in the
middle of a pennant race.</TE>
<TE>   The union leadership says that without a deadline, negotiations
will continue to drag into the off-season. Fine. That's where they
belong.</TE>
<TE>   So maybe owners wouldn't allow them to start next season. Isn't
that better than ending this season early?</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the NBA started a season late because of labor strife. Do
you even remember?</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, baseball canceled a season early, and nobody will ever
forget.</TE>
<TE>   Where are the true leadoff hitters, players unafraid to start
things off by sticking out their necks?</TE>
<TE>   Where are those cleanup hitters so proud of their muscle?</TE>
<TE>   The players spoke out individually against steroids, against the
advice of their union, and look what happened. The steroid issue has
apparently been solved.</TE>
<TE>   The players spoke out against confrontational and inconsistent
umpiring, and guess what? The leagues combined their umpiring staffs,
and the taunting has ended.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next couple of weeks, it will appear that a pale suit
named Donald Fehr has all the power.</TE>
<TE>   If only the players had the courage to realize that, no, that
power lies with them.</TE>
<TE>   Where are the St. Louis Cardinals, a team whose personal
misfortunes have led their sympathetic community to wrap them in a
giant, summer-long hug? Why can't they use this occasion to hug their
fans back?</TE>
<TE>   Where is Sammy Sosa? Fans literally bow to him every day. For
once, why can't he bow back?</TE>

<LD>Questions and answers about baseball's labor dispute:</LD>
<LD>   Q: What did the players do Friday?</LD>
<LD>   A: Their executive board voted, 57-0, to strike Aug. 30 if there
isn't an agreement by then.</LD>
<TE>   Q: What is the likelihood that a settlement will be reached
without a strike?</TE>
<TE>   A: Better than in previous disputes. The sides have narrowed their
differences in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is the track record of baseball labor disputes?</TE>
<TE>   A: Eight negotiations, eight work stoppages since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why set a strike date now?</TE>
<TE>   A: Players are convinced that if they finish the season without an
agreement, owners would lock them out (which NBA owners did to their
players) or change work rules. The union prefers to have any
confrontation late in the season, when owners take in more revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is the biggest obstacle to a settlement?</TE>
<TE>   A: Only one--the luxury tax. Players want high-spending teams to
face a higher threshold before a tax kicks in and a lower tax rate.
Owners want the tax to restrain spending to improve competitive
balance. Players look at it as a device, along with revenue sharing,
to transfer money from high-revenue teams to the other clubs. Player
say that a steep tax, along with revenue sharing, would act as a
salary cap, which owners deny.</TE>
<TE>   Q: At what point are the playoffs and World Series threatened?</TE>
<TE>   A: An agreement probably would have to be reached by Sept. 6 at
the latest to have any chance of preserving the 162-game schedule,
and by mid-September to save the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What would happen to the pennant races and postseason play if
the regular season is shortened?</TE>
<TE>   A: Any changes to the schedule and postseason format would have to
be negotiated</TE>
<TE>   Q: Which player would lose the most?</TE>
<TE>   A: Texas shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who has a $21-million base
salary this year, would lose $114,754.10 per day, a total of
$3,557,377.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What happens if there isn't a settlement in time to save the
season?</TE>
<TE>   A: That's what happened in 1994. The sides didn't resume
substantive negotiations until November. They negotiated through
March and the strike ended only after the National Labor Relations
Board issued an unfair labor practice complaint against owners and a
federal judge issued an injunction restoring the rules of the expired
contract.</TE>

<HD>Formidable Fleet in Star Class Event</HD>

<LD>A fleet of 114 boats from 26 countries, sailed by 11 former class
champions, four Olympic gold medalists and several America's Cup and
Volvo Ocean Race campaigners, will compete in the Nautica Star Class
World Championships next week on Santa Monica Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Sailing will begin Sunday from a base at the California Yacht Club
in Marina del Rey, and will run through Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The two-person boats will start on a divided starting line and
sail twice-around courses stretching from 2 to 2.6 nautical miles,
depending on wind conditions. One race is scheduled each of the six
days starting at 1 p.m. about a mile off the beach. Each boat may
discard its worst result.</LD>
<TE>   The defending champion is Fredrik Loof of Sweden, who prefers
stronger winds than are normally found on Santa Monica Bay. When he
won at Medemblik, the Netherlands, last year, his best races were in
double-digit breezes.</TE>
<TE>   Two young Irishmen, 12th-ranked Maxwell Treacy and crewman Anthony
Shanks, finished 32nd in their first worlds a year ago but became
dark-horse favorites by winning last weekend's 74-boat King of Spain
Regatta.</TE>
<TE>   Also not to be overlooked is three-time world champion--1961, '70
and '85--and 1984 Olympic champion Bill Buchan of Seattle. Although
67 and not a regular class competitor anymore, Buchan and crewman
Mark Brink won a race and finished ninth in the King of Spain behind
another former champion, Ross Macdonald of Canada, who won in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Other top contenders figure to be former champions Reynolds, '95
and 2000; Hagen, '81 and '97; Torben Grael, '90, and Alan Adler, '89,
both from Brazil; Colin Beashel, Australia, '98; Paul Cayard, San
Francisco, '88; Eric Doyle, San Diego, '99, and Joe Londrigan,
Springfield, Ill., '93.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen of the 19 top-ranked Star sailors will be competing.</TE>

<HD>The Time Is Right for Reis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since losing his position as the Galaxy's starting goalkeeper 10
games into the Major League Soccer season, Matt Reis has been biding
his time.</LD>
<LD>   The fifth-year pro from UCLA has been in the net for scrimmages,
exhibitions and U.S. Open Cup games, but he's had to watch Kevin
Hartman run the show in MLS play.</LD>
<LD>   That changes tonight.</LD>
<TE>   With Hartman suspended for a game because of the red card he
received in the closing moments of the Galaxy's 3-2 loss at Columbus
Wednesday, Reis will be in goal against Colorado for his first MLS
start since June 1.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different mentality," Reis said of starting a league game
down the stretch. "There's a lot more at stake. Those are the games
you want to play in ... and I'm relishing the chance."</TE>
<TE>   After starting six of the Galaxy's first seven games, Reis was
4-0-2 and had given up five goals. But a three-game losing skid,
during which opponents scored eight goals, prompted Coach Sigi Schmid
to change to Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, Hartman jumped on Columbus rookie midfielder Kyle
Martino in the box after a collision, Hartman saying later that
Martino had "put my career in jeopardy" by stepping on him. Both
players drew red-card expulsions, one-game suspensions and $250
fines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Reis' opportunity to play now," Schmid said. "We were
looking to get him a game in league here anyway, so it's a good
opportunity for him. That's why you have two goalkeepers and you just
[hope] for them to step up."</TE>
<TE>   Reis said he had anticipated starting against Kansas City next
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing comes up and, hopefully, I can still get the Kansas
City game and get a chance to play consecutive games and get into a
little bit of a rhythm," he said. "Because that's always nice if
you're on and things are going well. You like to be in that rhythm
where you're playing and you're playing [well.]</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a while since I've played in an MLS game, so the
opportunity is there and these are really big games that we have
coming up. We're pretty battered and worn right now so it's nice to
have a chance to help the team out."</TE>
<TE>   Schmid's tendency to stick with a goalkeeper who's hot could spell
more playing time for Reis, should his play warrant it.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully that will hold true and the team will do well and ...
we can get valuable points," Reis said. "The [MLS] race is tight and
we need these points."</TE>

game and fined $500 fine for accumulating too many caution points. It
is the Guatemalan striker's second suspension. He sat out the
Galaxy's 1-0 victory over Chicago on June 8 for having struck an
opponent the previous week. Coach Sigi Schmid said Sasha Victorine,
Gavin Glinton or Brian Mullan would start in his place.</TE>

<HD>Sparks on Their Guard</HD>
<DH>WNBA playoffs: Though they can eliminate Storm today, they
say pressure is squarely on them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their victory in Seattle may have looked easy. But the Sparks don't
see anything easy in trying to eliminate the Storm from the WNBA
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to get after them," said Lisa Leslie, who scored 24
points in the Sparks' 78-61 victory to give Los Angeles a 1-0 lead in
this Western Conference semifinal series. "The pressure is on us.
They don't have anything to lose but the game. It's a lot, but
[today] is still a bigger deal for us than it is for them."</LD>
<LD>   Added DeLisha Milton: "I don't think we got into their heads.
We're concentrating on playing the kind of ball we can play. And
that's being focused from the opening tip to the final buzzer and not
let whatever tactics they throw at us get to us."</LD>
<TE>   If the Sparks don't sound as if they are letting down their
collective guard, the Storm is making it clear it realizes it has to
come up with some different moves.</TE>
<TE>   The Storm can't let the Sparks shoot 55.9% again, nor can they
allow Leslie to conduct a layup drill, the way she did in the second
half, scoring 13 consecutive points. And Seattle cannot recklessly
put up shots and permit the Sparks to lock up rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remember," Seattle Coach Lin Dunn said, "that Los
Angeles shot exceptionally well [on Thursday]. And I mean making big,
tough shots. We know Lisa will get hers, but we were hurt by the
contributions of Mwadi Mabika and Tamecka Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. played as well as they have in any game this season. We have
to get to another level."</TE>
<TE>   Spark Coach Michael Cooper is eager to see the adjustments Seattle
makes, and he is just as eager to find out how the Sparks react to
being back in Staples Center after four consecutive road games.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fortunate to be up 1-0," Cooper said. "Now we come back
home. I still feel comfortable and confident back here, but it isn't
like last year. Seattle has beaten us here once. I'm pretty sure
they're not afraid of coming in here [and] know they can win if we
don't do the things we're supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks threw some subtle changes on defense at the Storm
Thursday, starting with altering their zone defense from a 2-3
configuration to a 3-2. That allowed the Spark defender in the middle
of the zone to roam through the middle, cutting off entry passes to
Lauren Jackson and Kamila Vodichkova.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks also worked at denying Sue Bird the ability to go
through the middle. Bird still had eight assists, but most of those
were on outside shots by Seattle. As its 35.2% field-goal shooting
suggests, the Storm didn't make many.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. raised their game," Bird said. "Now that we have the first
game off our backs, we'll feel less nervous out there."</TE>
<TE>   But the Storm also must have more energy, according to Adia
Barnes, who started the opener.</TE>
<TE>   "No excuses, but we didn't have the same sense of urgency that we
showed in winning the games we had to just to get [to the playoffs],"
Barnes said.</TE>

<TE>   TODAY</TE>
<TE>   vs. Seattle, 1, Channel 4</TE>
<TE>   Site--Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KPLS (830).</TE>
<TE>   Playoff series--Sparks lead, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Sparks are back in Staples Center for the first time
since losing to Houston there Aug. 8. That was the last time the
Sparks lost, and if Seattle needs any other ominous omens, the Sparks
have never lost a first-round playoff game, having gone 7-0. Seattle
has to decide whether to run and get its shots before L.A. can set up
on defense or be prepared to limit the possessions by keeping it a
half-court game. The Storm also needs a third scorer. Lauren Jackson
scored 19 points and Sue Bird 11, but no other Seattle player had
more than eight Thursday.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Help Is on the Way for Toledo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Toledo doesn't threaten his players. And he rarely gives
ultimatums.</LD>
<LD>   So it's not surprising that the plan devised by the UCLA coach to
avoid a repeat of off-the-field problems that torpedoed the Bruins
last season involves communication and trust.</LD>
<LD>   And it requires the players to be accountable for one another.</LD>
<TE>   Toledo has appointed a nine-player advisory council charged with
keeping tabs on teammates and ensuring that no one, for example,
takes possession of a car that doesn't belong to him (as tailback
DeShaun Foster did a year ago) or fails to inform coaches about an
arrest (as quarterback Cory Paus did).</TE>
<TE>   "The players sometimes know what their teammates are doing more
than the coaches do," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them, 'If something is going on and it's wrong, get it
stopped.' "</TE>
<TE>   The council, which will meet once a week, consists of one player
from each position group and will take the place of traditional
captains. Toledo will appoint game captains weekly.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, I am the one who is responsible," he said. "But
players will listen to one another."</TE>
<TE>   Council members are all juniors and seniors, although Toledo plans
to add a freshman in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't informants who are going to run to the coaches," said
Ryan Smith, a junior receiver on the council. "[Toledo] is putting it
on us to police the team. There is only so much you can do, but when
a teammate calls you out about something, you are apt to listen."</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, Toledo appointed Paus to the council. The senior
quarterback served several days in jail and performed 100 hours of
community service during the off-season because of two
driving-under-the-influence convictions, but he said this was not a
case of the fox guarding the henhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be on [the council] and I was appreciative and
grateful that I was included," Paus said. "I am the leader of the
offense and it will be a good thing for me and the team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterbacks Matt Moore of Hart High in Newhall and Drew Olson of
Piedmont impressed coaches during three days of freshmen-only
practices this week, but it is too early to tell whether either could
contribute this season.</TE>
<TE>   "They have caught on very fast," Toledo said. "They are both going
to be very good football players. I know they have physical skills."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman defensive lineman C.J. Niusulu has a court date Aug. 27
to face felony assault charges stemming from a fight at a drive-in
theater in his hometown of Barstow.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said that the defensive lineman would be dismissed from the
team if convicted of a felony and would be suspended for at least one
game if convicted of a misdemeanor.</TE>

<HD>Polamalu Will Sit Out Scrimmage</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy Polamalu, USC's All-American safety, did not practice Friday and
will not participate in today's scrimmage after suffering a mild
concussion when he tackled running back Justin Fargas on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the right time to take extra precautions," Coach Pete
Carroll said.</LD>
<LD>   Polamalu, who sat out four games during his freshman season
because of a concussion, underwent a CT scan and spent Thursday night
in a hospital under observation.</LD>
<TE>   "They said everything was fine," Polamalu said. "I wasn't worried
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Jason Leach worked with the first unit in Polamalu's
absence.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said the Trojans would run about 50 plays today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With fifth-year senior Carson Palmer entrenched as the starting
quarterback, the battle to become his backup is heating up.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt sophomore Matt Cassel and redshirt freshman Matt Leinart
will see significant action during today's scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting down to crunch time on figuring it out," Carroll
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Carroll cut back Palmer's workload to give Cassel and
Leinart more snaps, and on Friday both got work.</TE>
<TE>   "The scrimmage is not going to be that much different than
practice," Cassel said. "As a quarterback, you have to go out and
execute and move the chains."</TE>
<TE>   Leinart looks forward to another chance to compete.</TE>
<TE>   "You know you have to perform [in a scrimmage] because you know
this is what the coaches look for," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running back Sultan McCullough, nursing a sore left hamstring,
will not participate today.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to give him a couple days and make sure this isn't
going to linger," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Marcell Allmond remained in the hospital for a
third night for treatment of an infected right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Kevin Arbet will start at left cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   Junior college transfer Ronald Nunn and freshman Justin Wyatt
continue to push Darrell Rideaux on the right side.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior cornerback Miguel Fletcher did not attend afternoon
practice and is mulling his future in the program, Carroll said....
Wide receiver D. Hale will miss the scrimmage because of a sore
ankle.... Senior fullback Chad Pierson injured his left hamstring
running a pass route and might sit out.... Freshman punter Tom Malone
did not kick for the second day in a row because of a sore right
hamstring. He is expected to kick today.... Linebacker Chris Prosser
remained sidelined while recovering from a hard shot to the head
sustained earlier this week.</TE>

chances to tie, but Swoopes committed a turnover and rookie Michelle
Snow missed a layup.</LD>
<LD>   Free throws by Utah's Jennifer Azzi, Marie Ferdinand and Adrienne
Goodson, who had a game-high 20 points, helped the franchise secure
its first playoff victory before a crowd of 6,693.</LD>
<TE>   Swoopes led Houston with 17 points but made only five of 19 shots,
and the Comets missed 17 consecutive shots in one stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 73, New York 55--After receiving her award as WNBA rookie
of the year, Tamika Catchings scored 29 points to lead the Fever in
the opener of the best-of-three Eastern Conference semifinal series
at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   It was Indiana's first playoff game in the three-year history of
the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   The 10,198 fans at Indianapolis chanted "M-V-P, M-V-P" in the
second half as Catchings finished with 11 rebounds, her 13th
double-double, four assists and three steals. She made 11 of 19
shots, including four of eight three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The Fever outshot the top-seeded Liberty (50.9% to 41.5%) and
outrebounded them (35-24).</TE>

<HD>Twins Beat Martinez, Mays Gets a Shutout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Mays wasn't excited about facing Pedro Martinez for the second
time in six days. But he sure pitched as if he was.</LD>
<LD>   Mays threw a two-hitter as the Minnesota Twins snapped Martinez's
scoreless innings streak and beat the Boston Red Sox, 5-0, Friday
night at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   "Our offense was definitely looking forward to facing Pedro more
than I was," Mays said.</LD>
<TE>   David Ortiz and Jacque Jones homered for the Twins, who ended
Martinez's run at a career-high 35 scoreless innings--the longest
shutout streak in the majors since Greg Maddux went 39 1/3 innings in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (16-3) struck out 10--including seven in a row--in his
second complete game of the season. But he gave up three earned runs
and eight hits to lose for the first time in 11 starts since a 2-1
defeat June 14 at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander was 9-0 in his previous 10 outings, and the five
runs were the most he'd allowed since a no-decision May 7 at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez beat Mays 2-0 six days ago, striking out eight in eight
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe Mays, I can't say enough about him," Twin Manager Ron
Gardenhire said. "He was up for this battle, he wanted it. This time
he knew he had to shut him out, and he did it."</TE>
<TE>   Mays (2-4) carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning before Johnny
Damon's two-out double to right-center. The only other hit he gave up
was a single by Carlos Baerga in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Mays struck out six and walked two in his fifth career shutout and
first complete game of the season. An All-Star last year, Mays spent
more than three months on the disabled list this season with an elbow
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota reliever LaTroy Hawkins was ejected from the game for
not moving his chair in the bullpen. For the first few innings,
Hawkins sat in the Minnesota bullpen along the third-base line with
his chair tilted away from the stands.</TE>
<TE>   Umpire Tim Tschida approached Hawkins in the middle of the third
inning and asked him to move his chair. But the reliever refused and
Tschida eventually ejected Hawkins, who became irate and rushed
Tschida before being restrained by several teammates and escorted
from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 6, Toronto 5--Alex Rodriguez hit his 39th homer with one out
in the bottom of the ninth to give the Rangers the win at Arlington,
Texas. Texas left fielder Frank Catalanotto broke a bone in his right
hand when he was hit by a pitch and could miss the rest of the
season. Catalanotto was hit by Toronto reliever Mark Hendrickson to
start the seventh inning. The Rangers said Catalanotto will be out
four to six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 1, Chicago 0--Cory Lidle extended his scoreless streak to
22 innings and Jermaine Dye homered to lead the Athletics at Oakland.
After nearly getting dropped from Oakland's rotation last month,
Lidle (6-9) pitched seven commanding innings and combined with three
relievers on the A's 14th shutout--their fourth in his last six
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 6, Baltimore 5--Randall Simon homered and drove in three
runs and the Tigers overcame three home runs by the Orioles to win at
Baltimore. Steve Sparks (8-11) won his third consecutive start for
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 6, Tampa Bay 5--Raul Ibanez hit a two-run homer with
two outs in the ninth inning as the Royals rallied to win at St.
Petersburg, Fla. Ibanez hit his 19th homer off closer Esteban Yan
(5-7).</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Seattle 3--Bernie Williams went four for four with
four RBIs, including a two-run double to highlight a four-run ninth,
to help the Yankees pull away for a victory at Seattle.</TE>

<HD>Hand Injury Keeps Salmon Out Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Salmon took a few swings in a batting cage, felt pain in his left
hand and sat out his fifth straight game Friday after being hit in
the hand by a pitch last Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon, who had hoped to return to the lineup early this week,
admitted that he was discouraged at the slow recovery.</LD>
<LD>   "A little bit, but it's a bone bruise and it's going to heal on
its own schedule," he said. "I was hoping for more with the day off
[Thursday]. But from a pain standpoint, there's pain and you lose
grip strength."</LD>
<TE>   Salmon, who will turn 34 next Saturday, had not missed a game this
season until sitting out this week.</TE>
<TE>   He is experiencing a renaissance at the plate, batting .297 with
18 home runs and 76 runs batted in, a year after getting lows in his
career in average (.227), homers (17) and RBIs (49).</TE>
<TE>   "Tim's getting better, but he's still not where we hoped he'd be,"
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "We're still saying he's
day-to-day, but hopefully it's sooner rather than later."</TE>
<TE>   Said Salmon: "We're just going to up the anti-inflammatory and
let's see how the weekend goes. I don't want to push it and [injure
it further to] prolong it."</TE>
<TE>   The longer he remains out, shortening the Angel bench, the more
likely he'll get a stint on the disabled list, a move that would be
retroactive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before joining the Angels in a July 30 trade, the oft-traveled
Alex Ochoa had set up shop in five major league clubhouses. Not many,
he said, have been as comfortable and quick a fit as the Angels',
though.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been great; everyone's just been awesome," Ochoa said.
"[Getting comfortable] comes with time."</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa is batting only .227, but he's already played in eight games
since coming to the Angels from Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   "His timing couldn't have been any better with [Salmon and Darin
Erstad] out," Scioscia said. "We talk about the depth of our outfield
and he's contributed, not only with his arm and defense, but
offensively, he's drawn some big walks. He's going to hit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia's protest of the Tigers' batting out of order on
Wednesday became a moot point when the Angels came from behind to
beat the Tigers, 5-4. But Scioscia said he may call Ralph Nelson,
baseball's vice president in charge of umpiring, when the team is in
New York next week to clarify the rule to see how the protest would
have played out.</TE>
<TE>   "Just for the official explanation of it and for education,"
Scioscia said.</TE>

<HD>Schilling Beats Cubs for 20th Win</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He is fastest to milestone in six years, reaching
it one game later in season than Smoltz in '96.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHNNY ROSENSTEIN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Curt Schilling put up some impressive numbers Friday--the type of
numbers that are becoming routine for the Arizona Diamondbacks' ace
right-hander.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling won his major-league-leading 20th game in Arizona's 2-1
victory over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, making him the
fastest pitcher to 20 wins since Atlanta's John Smoltz in 1996.
Friday's game was the Diamondbacks' 122nd of the season; Smoltz, who
finished 24-8 in 1996, won his 20th in the Braves' 121st game.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very proud of it," Schilling said after becoming a 20-game
winner for the second consecutive season. "I had the pitch count up a
little bit in the middle innings, but I got some early outs and the
pitch count came down."</LD>
<TE>   Schilling retired 18 consecutive Cubs after Bill Mueller's
third-inning single and was an out away from a shutout when Sammy
Sosa smacked a 1-2 pitch into the bleachers in right-center field.
After Fred McGriff followed with a single, Arizona Manager Bob Brenly
called on reliever Byung-Hyun Kim to get the final out, which he did
when Corey Patterson flied out after Moises Alou had singled.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (20-4) struck out 12 and yielded six hits, a run and no
walks. He has struck out 45 and walked only one over his last five
games. For the season, he has walked only 19. No Cub leadoff hitter
reached base, and only two Cubs went to three balls. Schilling threw
88 strikes out of 118 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "He was outstanding," Brenly said. "He had a great game plan and
went out and executed the way we've seen him do so many times this
year. He's a man on a mission. He's the most prepared pitcher I have
ever seen. Physically and mentally, he's on top of his game."</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the players don't strike, Schilling has an excellent
chance to become the first pitcher to win 25 games since Oakland's
Bob Welch went 27-6 in 1990. The last National League pitcher to win
at least 25 was Steve Carlton, who was 27-10 with Philadelphia in
1972.</TE>
<TE>   There hasn't been a 30-game winner since Detroit's Denny McLain in
1968, and there isn't likely to be one any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has to go perfectly," Schilling said. "In a five-man
rotation you get 35 to 36 starts."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's start was Schilling's 27th. He has gone at least six
innings in all of them, and at least seven innings 24 times.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there have been other runs [like this] in the past,"
Brenly said, "but I find it hard to believe anybody has put together
a better string than he has this season."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Grissom Takes a Grim View</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Marquis Grissom played for Montreal in 1994, the year the Expos had
baseball's best record in August before a strike wiped out the rest
of the season, including the playoffs and World Series.</LD>
<LD>   So the Dodger outfielder wasn't about to get all misty eyed or
lament the possibility of another work stoppage laying waste to a
promising Dodger season. The current labor dispute, which led to the
players setting an Aug. 30 strike date Friday, is all about business,
and Grissom puts business before pleasure in this game.</LD>
<LD>   "All the fans look at is the money, not the history of the game
and what players have done for salary arbitration and free agency,"
Grissom said. "We can't just let that go down the drain. A lot of
players paved the way for us, stood up for us years ago, and we have
to do the same. This is for the betterment of the game."</LD>
<TE>   For those same reasons, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca, who signed a
three-year, $7.25-million contract in spring training, does not view
his responsibilities as the team's union representative as a burden.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving in New York from Montreal around 3 a.m. Friday, Lo
Duca and about a dozen bleary-eyed Dodgers were in the union office
by 10 a.m. to sit in on a conference call of the union's executive
board.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent a lot of time in the minor leagues trying to get to this
point," Lo Duca said. "Guys like [Kevin Brown] and a lot of others
went through this in 1994 and did the right thing for me, so I could
get the money I'm getting now, and I want to do the right thing for
the guys after me.</TE>
<TE>   "I know a lot of the young guys don't want to strike, but that's
the way it works. Guys like [45-year-old Dodger reliever] Jesse
Orosco went through this a few times for me, and that's why we stick
together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations to this point have been considered cordial,
especially compared to the hostility surrounding the 1994 work
stoppage, but with a strike date now set, players believe the
rhetoric--and battle over public opinion--will intensify.</TE>
<TE>   "[The owners] have to make their side look as best they can, and
we have to do what we have to do," Grissom said. "When we set a date,
I know it looks like we're the ones stirring up all the chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to do that to put our foot down and get things going, so
that maybe something gets done in the next few days. That's what
we're hoping for. But the same thing happened in 1994, and I'm not
expecting anything different unless a miracle happens."</TE>
<TE>   That's why Grissom wasn't enthusiastic Monday when a management
lawyer said he was optimistic that an agreement might be reached in
the next couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't too happy when they said they were real close to getting
something done," Grissom said. "To me, that's a bad sign."</TE>
<TE>   Grissom seemed skeptical that another work stoppage could be
avoided, but most players were still confident an agreement could be
reached without a strike.</TE>
<TE>   "My gut feeling is, something will get done," Lo Duca said.
"Things are a lot better now than they were in 1994.... I can
understand the fans' point of view and their frustrations, and I know
both sides will be calling each other out.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're light years ahead of where we were in 1994 at this
point, which gives us a ray of hope."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Players chose an Aug. 30 strike date--as opposed to
mid-September--in hopes that if there is a work stoppage, it will end
soon enough to maintain the integrity of the schedule and postseason
play.</TE>
<TE>   But Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said that if there were a strike of
10 days or more, the quality of play would be affected when games
resumed.</TE>
<TE>   "If pitchers miss a start, that could drastically alter the number
of pitches that could be thrown [in a return start]," Tracy said. "To
think a starter could throw 100 pitches ... that's a dangerous
proposition.</TE>
<TE>   "If a strike lasts three or four days, it could help the position
players. It would rejuvenate them. But if you go a week to 10 days
[without playing], then you're going to see some rusty looking
swings. The ball will appear a lot smaller than it did."</TE>

<TE>   Update--Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan, who missed the previous
six games because of a protrusion in his lower back, returned to the
lineup Friday night. Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek batted leadoff
for the first time this season but struck out in two of his first
three at-bats. The Dodgers have signed reliever Mike Magnante to a
minor league contract, and the veteran left-hander, who was released
by Oakland on Aug. 4, was assigned to triple-A Las Vegas.</TE>

<HD>Are They Down to Last Strike?</HD>
<DH>Baseball: If players walk out this time, fans at Angel game
say they may walk away from game and not come back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like scores of baseball fans who attended the Angels' game against
the Cleveland Indian on Friday night at Edison Field, Rick Grissom
reacted with anger and disappointment to the news that the players
union had set an Aug. 30 strike date.</LD>
<LD>   And the 26-year-old Rancho Cucamonga resident sounded a warning
that he thinks players and owners might want to consider before
allowing the major leagues' ninth work stoppage since 1972.</LD>
<LD>   "I think they have to get it done," Grissom said. "I think people
have had it this time. I'm a huge baseball fan and I don't know if
I'll come back."</LD>
<TE>   Several fans said they were still smarting over the most recent
strike in 1994, which resulted in the cancellation of the World
Series, and vowed not to return if the players walk out again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting back into the swing of it," said Mike Ducharm of
Huntington Beach, "just to have it happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Ducharm, who said he is vice president of transportation for Sysco
Corp., a food-service marketer and distributor that supplies Edison
Field, wondered why baseball couldn't be more like his industry in
terms of handling contract disputes. In the event of a dispute at his
workplace, Ducharm said, "we sit down and try to be reasonable and
work it out." Not once in more than three decades have the sides
failed to reach an agreement, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though fans differed on whether players or owners were to blame,
most said they hoped an agreement could be reached before the
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   This was especially the case among Angel fans such as Grissom,
whose team leads the American League wild-card race and could make
its first postseason appearance since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so hard because I'm so into this season," Grissom said.
"Finally we're getting some success and there's a strike looming."</TE>
<TE>   Said Al Salfrank of Norco: "It would be very disappointing. It's a
very exciting time of year for these guys right now."</TE>
<TE>   Several fans worried about the effects of a work stoppage on their
children. Willie Hernandez of Irvine glanced at the three kids he
brought to the game, all wearing Angel caps, and asked, "Are you
going to deny these kids baseball?"</TE>
<TE>   Others said the season has already been ruined--strike or no
strike--by the greed of those who own the teams and play the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't be here right now," Mark Paxton of Corona said while
standing in line to enter the ballpark. The only reason Paxton and
coworker Tony Sadler attended Friday's game, they said, was because
they received free tickets from their employer. "I wouldn't be here
otherwise," Paxton said.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the strike, less than two weeks before Sept. 11,
wasn't lost on teenager Barry DeMartini of Santa Rosa, who attended
the game with his family.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a bad time for America," DeMartini said. "America
needs a World Series because of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   The end of August also might be an inopportune time to strike for
less obvious reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's assume it happens," Hernandez said. "September [5],
football season starts. All the fans are going to go from baseball to
football without missing a beat. Baseball's going to get beaned."</TE>
<TE>   William Black Jr., 36, of Twentynine Palms said he has another,
more personal reason for his uneasiness regarding a possible strike:
His father, William Black Sr., is in declining health and may not be
around to see another playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   Said Black: "We're hoping he will hang on to see the Angels reach
the World Series."</TE>

<HD>It Could Be Big Payday for Frankel</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Already the country's leading trainer in purse earnings, Bobby
Frankel has a chance to hit a personal lottery this afternoon in
Illinois, New York, and to a lesser extent, California.</LD>
<LD>   Frankel, who could be headed to his third consecutive Eclipse
Award as the nation's top trainer, has entrants in six graded stakes
worth a combined $3.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   At Arlington Park in suburban Chicago, Frankel will be represented
by favorite Beat Hollow in the Arlington Million and by contenders
Tates Creek in the $700,000 Beverly D. Stakes and Chiselling in the
$400,000 Secretariat.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, You will seek another Grade I win in the $750,000
Alabama Stakes after El Gran Papa tries for a minor upset in the
$300,000 Breeders' Cup Handicap at Saratoga in upstate New York.</TE>
<TE>   Completing what Frankel hopes will be a lucrative day is
Inesperado, who will aim for his second victory in as many U.S.
starts in the $150,000 La Jolla Handicap at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Without question, Beat Hollow is the hall-of-fame trainer's best
shot at success. The 5-year-old Sadler's Wells horse is the best turf
horse in the country and only bad luck has kept him from being
perfect in five races in the States.</TE>
<TE>   Owned and bred by Prince Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms, Beat
Hollow was particularly cursed in the Eddie Read Handicap on July 28
at Del Mar. He was trapped along the inside for most of the 1 1/8
miles, and by the time he was able to get free, it was too late.
Sarafan, who was given a perfect ride by jockey Corey Nakatani, got
the jump on the 1-2 favorite and went on to beat him by 1 1/4
lengths. Sarafan is back in the Million, along with Forbidden Apple,
Cheshire, Paolini, Mystery Giver and Ulundi.</TE>
<TE>   The defeat cost Alex Solis, who had ridden Beat Hollow
exclusively, the mount for the Million, which is run at 1 1/4 miles
on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   According to Frankel, Solis was removed in favor of Jerry Bailey
at the request of the owner. Bailey, the country's leading jockey
almost annually, won the Million for Juddmonte and Frankel on Chester
House two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Juddmonte, Frankel and Bailey also will team in the Beverly D.,
which goes at 1 3/16 miles on the turf, with the hard-trying Tates
Creek. A 4-year-old Rahy filly making her first appearance in a Grade
I, she has won six of nine, but this will be the toughest field she
has seen.</TE>
<TE>   The three main contenders in the Beverly D. are Astra, who has won
three in a row for trainer Laura De Seroux; defending champion
England's Legend, and Golden Apples, who will have a new rider in
Patrick Valenzuela. Astra will try to make amends for her last-place
finish as the 7-10 favorite in last year's race.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey also has Orchard Park, the horse to fear most in the
Secretariat, a 1 1/4-mile turf race.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Peter Vegso and trained by Bill Mott, the 3-year-old
Hennessy colt has won six of eight on the grass.</TE>
<TE>   Chiselling, a half brother to Chester House, as well as Decarchy
and Honest Lady, will be ridden by Kent Desormeaux as he tries for
his second consecutive stakes victory. He was a nose winner of the
Lexington last month at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   A private purchase by Frankel for owner Ed Gann in the summer of
2001, You has been a money machine. She has won five Grade I stakes
and is perfect in two starts at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Alabama comes only three weeks after her
gut-wrenching nose victory over Carson Hollow in a memorable Test
Stakes and she is very suspect at 1 1/4 miles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The condition of Sunday Silence, the 1989 Kentucky Derby,
Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic winner, continues to deteriorate
at his stable in Japan, and a decision is expected soon on whether to
euthanize the 16-year-old horse.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Silence is battling laminitis, a severe and painful hoof
problem.</TE>

<LD>Looking for his second victory in the $150,000 La Jolla Handicap in
three years, trainer Bob Baffert will send out 40% of the field
today.</LD>
<LD>   Del Mar's leading trainer for five consecutive years, Baffert, who
won this event with Purely Cozzene in 2000, will be represented by
Mountain Rage and Regiment in the field of five. The Grade III is a
prep for the $300,000 Del Mar Derby on Sept. 7.</LD>
<LD>   A gray son of Mecke owned by a partnership that includes Natalie
Moss, Mountain Rage had won three consecutive races on the turf
before finishing third as the favorite in the first division of the
Oceanside Stakes on Del Mar's opening day.</LD>
<TE>   He had been idle for more than three months before that, so he
figures to improve and, with jockey David Flores sticking with
Regiment, Victor Espinoza, who won the La Puente at Santa Anita with
the colt on April 14, is back aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Regiment also had a three-race winning streak end in his latest
outing. He lost by a nose to Inesperado, who is also in the La Jolla
lineup, in the Cinema Breeders' Cup Handicap on June 30 at Hollywood
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by 3 Plus U Stable, Inesperado, a French-bred son of
Zayyani, beat Regiment by a nose to win the Cinema in his U.S. debut.</TE>
<TE>   He will be trying to give trainer Bobby Frankel his second
consecutive victory in the La Jolla. Frankel won a year ago with
Marine.</TE>
<TE>   The field is completed by Doc Holiday, who won the Will Rogers on
June 1 at Hollywood Park before finishing second in the Arlington
Classic four weeks later, and Mutinyonthebounty, who was sixth as the
2-1 favorite in his U.S. debut in the second division of the
Oceanside.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Del Mar's seventh is the meet's first
seven-furlong race for 2-year-olds and includes Listen Indy, who was
second to the very promising Vindication, and Truckle Feature, the
beaten favorite in his debut for Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Randy Schulhofer. The trainer won with four of his
first 11 starters at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Uriel Lopez. The jockey won with only one of his first
72 mounts at Arlington. He posted his only victory aboard 22-1 shot
Feminine Fury on Aug. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: An exacta box of Disguys Dalimit, Unrelenting
Grit and No Curfew in Del Mar's fifth race.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 0/39. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $0/$223.80. Total money bet: $340.</TE>

<LD>Panther Mountain has one derby victory on his resume in 2002 and
he'll try to add another tonight at Los Alamitos when he takes on
nine other 3-year-olds in the $207,800 Golden State Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Runners in the Golden State, a Grade I at 400 yards, have won 46
races and earned more than $1.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   Panther Mountain, owned by Guy Weimer and trained by Chuck Treece,
has contributed seven of those victories and earned more than
$137,000. He beat Mini Rock by three-quarters of a length in winning
the Los Alamitos Winter Derby on Feb 23.</LD>
<TE>   Sent to the sidelines after that victory, Panther Mountain, a
Texas-bred, returned in the trials for the Golden State Derby and
finished fourth, losing by a neck as the 3-5 favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Treece, who has never won this race, believes his colt will be a
different animal tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a monster right now," Treece said. "He got a lot out of his
race and he's looking really good. [Jockey] Eddie Aceves galloped him
the other morning and he was struggling to hold him back. He came out
of that last race so strong."</TE>
<TE>   The race, the ninth of 11 on the card, will have only eight
betting interests. Sassy Smith, who won the 2001 Kindergarten
Futurity, and Winner Wants Cash will race coupled as the Dutch
Masters III-owned entry, and A Tac First, who was the fastest
qualifier in winning his heat at 14-1, and Fly Home First are owned
by Double Bar S Ranch and trained by Dan Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   A gelded son of Strawfly Special, Fly Home First was third at 19-1
in his trial and he'll be trying to provide jockey Carlos Bautista
with his second consecutive victory in the Golden State. Bautista won
the 2001 renewal with Royal Dip and no jockey has repeated since Kip
Didericksen won with Apprehend in 1990 and Takin On The Cash in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the field, from the inside out, includes Chicks
Rapidash; Check Him Out, who earned his biggest victory in the 2001
Ed Burke Memorial Futurity; Tiny Rocket Dash, Famous Cartel and Last
Shall Be First, also trained by Francisco.</TE>
