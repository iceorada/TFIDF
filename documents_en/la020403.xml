<LD>A group of restaurant and tavern operators is putting a new spin on
the popular pastime of scrutinizing celebrity physique. They say many
celebrities revered for their bodies--Russell Crowe, Tom Cruise and
Brad Pitt among them--may be hunks, but they're obese hunks according
to new federal weight guidelines.</LD>
<LD>   In an effort to deflate the surgeon general's December 2001 health
warning, which suggests Americans eat less, the restaurant and tavern
operators (a.k.a. Center for Consumer Freedom) launched a
counteroffensive. On the Web site consumerfreedom.com they posted a
body-mass-index calculator titled "Does the Government Think You're
Fat?"</LD>
<LD>   Users can match their own physiques to those of sports and film
celebrities by typing in different height and weight combinations.</LD>
<TE>   For example, type in "6 foot 2 inches" and "230 pounds" and the
scale reads: "You're so fat, you look like Russell Crowe. Yes!
According to the federal government the handsome hero is overweight.
(As is Tom Cruise.)"</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, a user who types in "6-foot, 200 pounds" is deemed
overweight, a category shared by Michael Jordan (who is 6-foot-6, 216
pounds) and Cal Ripkin Jr. (who is 6-foot-4, 220 pounds). The site
also features a list of 16 college basketball players who made it to
the Final Four playoffs at weights it says the government considers
too high.</TE>
<TE>   "It causes us to question standards by which those things are
measured," said Mike Burita, spokesman for Center for Consumer
Freedom. In compiling the body-index scale, Burita used several
sources, including some figures tabulated by UCLA statistics lecturer
Vivian Lew, who used information from Internet fan sites to create a
table for one of her classes.</TE>
<TE>   Lew learned later that some of the weight figures were suspect.
(The true heights and weights of Cruise, Pitt and Crowe couldn't be
confirmed.) But Burita stands by the accuracy of his group's body
mass interpretations.</TE>
<TE>   As proof, he cites interviews in which Crowe estimates his weight
at 228 to 238 pounds. The actor's height, Burita says, is reportedly
between 5-foot-10 and 5-foot-11. Using any combination of those
stats, Burita said, Crowe is still considered obese by the new
standard, which, he says, ignores that muscle is heavier than fat.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the government's new standards dismiss the findings
of Burita's group as "exceptions to the rule." "There are some people
who are fit," said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center
for Science in the Public Interest, "but appear [by the new
standards] to be overweight."</TE>
<TE>   Dome Debuts</TE>
<TE>   After its multimillion-dollar face lift, the Cinerama Dome at
Sunset Boulevard and Ivar Avenue in Hollywood was home to its first
premiere Monday night: the college movie "National Lampoon's Van
Wilder."</TE>
<TE>   The dome, which has been closed since the summer of 2000 for the
renovation and the construction of ArcLight, a 14-screen cinema
behind it, was lit blue, with a red carpet snaking around its base.</TE>
<TE>   As actors streamed from their limos, Carmen Electra created some
static among the crowd of photographers. "Carmen! Carmen!" they
catcalled. A group of fans called out to Jillian Barberie. "Jillian!
We love you! Every morning!"</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Ryan Reynolds plays Van Wilder, the most popular
student on campus, who, when his father finds out that he has been in
school for seven years, must turn to professional party planning to
pay his tuition. After the screening, cast and friends gathered at
the Sunset Room, where Reynolds received a line of well-wishers.</TE>
<TE>   "You were fantastic," a woman gushed.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds shrugged and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   The actor said he grew up with National Lampoon, calling it "sort
of kitschy. Some jokes almost seem as if they had been patented," he
joked. "Certainly, it's not 'Sense and Sensibility,'" he added. "But
it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think that going out to dinner with John Kennedy and
Carolyn Bessette would be glamorous and exciting," writes former
George magazine editor Richard Blow in an excerpt from his memoir,
"American Son: A Portrait of John F. Kennedy Jr." (Henry Holt and
Co., May 2002) published in Vanity Fair's May issue. "But simply
making conversation was stressful. We felt that everything we said
had to be witty and scintillating. When the bill finally came I
realized I was relieved."</TE>

<KH>Chris Erskine: THE GUY CHRONICLES</KH>
<HD>It's the Little Things That Make a Guy Feel His Age</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Erskine</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Certain milestones stick with a guy--the first time you notice that a
centerfold is younger than you, the first time a flight attendant
calls you "sir."</LD>
<LD>   Now, suddenly, it's doctors who are younger. Which makes it
official: Middle Age.</LD>
<LD>   "That your Porsche down there?" I ask the young doctor, looking
out his office window at a purple convertible.</LD>
<TE>   "No," he says, "I have a Jaguar."</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, I'd prefer a doctor who drives a Porsche, but I'm not
picky about my doctors. If one will see me, I will see him. I spend
more time selecting my socks.</TE>
<TE>   "Asthma?" he asks, going over some checklist.</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   "Allergies?" he queries.</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   "Ever had sex with a prostitute?"</TE>
<TE>   Now there's a delicate question. One second, we're talking about
cars and allergies. The next we're talking about sex for hire, which
is a little personal, even in this era of openness.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I've never taken that particular plunge, but you always
sort of wonder if you're the only guy who hasn't, and--ask almost
anyone--there are no relationships where money is not an issue or a
certain amount of bartering doesn't take place. Sex is almost always
for sale on some level, whether it involves a Fiji vacation or braces
for the kids.</TE>
<TE>   "No," I finally say, but I can see the skepticism in the doctor's
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   I go in for a checkup once every three or four years, usually a
different doctor each time.</TE>
<TE>   I'm reaching the age where when you go for a checkup, they decide
that it's probably time to use some large scoping device, roughly the
size of a lawn mower, to check out your colon or one of your other
inner tubes.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there's something wrong somewhere," a doctor always seems
to say.</TE>
<TE>   Which is OK, so long as they don't get too personal. If I wanted a
lot of physical contact, I'd have brought wine and flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "So, anything bothering you?" the doctor finally asks.</TE>
<TE>   Now, doesn't that just open a can of tapeworms.</TE>
<TE>   Anything bothering me? Well, yeah. I have this hitch in my golf
swing and a stutter in my backhand.</TE>
<TE>   I know every inch of pavement on the 20-mile drive to work, having
driven it every day for a dozen years. Not that it bothers me. Well,
yeah, sometimes it bothers me.</TE>
<TE>   And, since you've asked, I've got this ringing in my ears, but I
think it's just the kids, of which we have 12 or 14, I can't keep
track. They're in and out of the house with their noisy little
friends at all hours, slamming the front door and leaving Dr Pepper
cans all over the place.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, ever notice how the girls wear rings on their thumbs
and nothing over their tummies? That bother you, doc? It bothers me.</TE>
<TE>   Anything else bothering me? Yeah, this Enron thing really chills
my chestnuts. If there's anyone who scares me more than a guy with a
gun, it's some suit with an MBA degree and a "fiduciary
responsibility to the corporation." That scares me.</TE>
<TE>   What's bothering me? Well, both cars are burning oil, and I'm
scared like hell to bring them in, knowing it's going to be 2,000
bucks no matter what.</TE>
<TE>   And since you asked, something else is sort of bothering me. I
worry that I fantasize an unhealthful amount--night and day,
really--but lately it's not just about sports, like you might guess,
but food, too. I can spot a good pair of chicken legs at 100 yards,
smell a sizzling plate of ribs at 100 miles. Before breakfast, I'm
thinking about lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of lunch, I've spent most of my Irish life shunning a
noon beer when now I hear that a drink or two a day may actually be
good for you, and what kind of message is the medical world trying to
send us anyway--that we're eating too much and drinking too little?</TE>
<TE>   Praise the surgeon general and pass me a cold Coors.</TE>
<TE>   Anything bothering me?</TE>
<TE>   No, not really, but my wife insists I'm colorblind, when in fact
I'm pretty sure it's just a matter of bad taste or poor lighting.</TE>
<TE>   "Halle Berry's black?" I exclaimed recently while watching the
Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   "See, you're colorblind," my wife said.</TE>
<TE>   "Woody Allen's white?" I said.</TE>
<TE>   "See?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Not without my glasses.</TE>
<TE>   But my memory is pretty good, near as I can remember. Been married
almost 20 years. Twenty, a number I keep coming back to in my head,
another number that can't be right.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, my life is full of numbers that can't be right. My
daughter's 18. My car's 12.</TE>
<TE>   The Master Card balance is always a thousand bucks too high, and
my 401k is down at least 20k. It's now, technically, a 381k
retirement account. Where's one of those eager MBAs when you need
one?</TE>
<TE>   Anything bothering me? The Lakers are erratic on defense and the
Dodgers are charging $8 just to park. To park, mind you. For that, a
person could go to a movie, where happy endings are assured but the
food costs more.</TE>
<TE>   See, there I go again with the food, when really what I should be
thinking about is my next drink, which would lead to another drink,
and then I'd be more healthy. Fit as a fiddle. Healthy as a horse. A
Clydesdale probably, hitched to my own beer wagon.</TE>
<TE>   So, since you asked, there are a few little things that are
bothering me as I enter Middle Age. Not many. Hundred, tops. It's
hard to know just where to start.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything bothering you?" the doctor asks, his pen poised, his
clipboard ready.</TE>
<TE>   "No, not really," I say.</TE>

<HD>Canyons a World Away From Urban Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A friend reminds me about the canyon roads. About the restorative
powers of the canyon roads. When the freeways seem like gridlocked
shrines to human folly and the surface streets shrill with endless,
mindless commerce, when the beach seems too difficult to get to and
the mountains too far away, the canyon roads beckon.</LD>
<LD>   Twisting off the spine of Mulholland Drive, they run up and over
the hills that separate the urban sprawls of city and valley, not
streets but roads. Laurel Canyon, Coldwater Canyon, Benedict Canyon,
Topanga Canyon--even the names make promises.</LD>
<LD>   Laurel Canyon is the oldest and perhaps the most famous; Angelenos
used it to get from Hollywood to the San Fernando Valley even before
there was a Hollywood. Most of Laurel Canyon is not a canyon at
all--the road, which begins on West Sunset Boulevard, goes as far
north as San Fernando. Approaching from the Valley side, the road
ducks under the 134, crosses Ventura Boulevard, then winds along a
few miles of oak-sheltered lawns and homes. The canyon really begins
south of Mulholland Drive, where, for 15 minutes or so, depending on
traffic, it slides through another world.</LD>
<TE>   Lawns disappear and eucalyptuses, their slender trunks tilted in
tattered skirts, stand in clusters like Degas dancers at the barre.
Houses glimmer improbably from the shoulders and laps of the hills,
and the land falls away into ravines lined with green, streaked with
gold.</TE>
<TE>   Passing the countrified Laurel Canyon store and dry cleaners it
seems impossible that just a mile or so away, Sunset blinks and
roars.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles west, the journey on Coldwater Canyon moves in the
opposite direction. From the south, as it rises out of Beverly Drive,
past emerald lawns and million-dollar homes, it remains high-end
residential until it hits Mulholland. On Coldwater, it is the ride
north that ventures wild.</TE>
<TE>   On an early spring day when the sky over the Valley is 17 shades
of shifting gray, the road hurtles down past fir tree and magnolia,
past shaggy humps of oleander, twisting just enough to make tires
grown weary of straight roads yelp with pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   The writhing figures of cypress trees flash by, and sudden scarlet
salutes of bougainvillea. There are houses here and there, but that
is not the point. The road is now a tunnel, through sky and earth,
through time, heedless of any.</TE>
<TE>   Then, just past the church of St. Michael and All Angels,
Coldwater settles down, smoothes her hair, buttons her shirt and
moves serenely toward suburbia.</TE>
<TE>   On a map, Benedict Canyon is a serpentine bit of string between
Mulholland and Sunset. It's about a 10-minute drive along Mulholland
from Coldwater to Benedict, just long enough to remind anyone weary
of life in Los Angeles that there is no other road in the world like
Mulholland Drive. There is a reason this road has become the standard
backdrop of noir: Here is a place that isn't really a place, a world
between the worlds.</TE>
<TE>   Benedict Canyon shies off Mulholland, suddenly, at an angle and
weaves its way along the lip of land in a way that makes it almost
impossible for a driver to appreciate the view. Scrub-filled ravines,
clefts and crevices softened by weeds, fall away from the road; on
opposite hills, houses of three stories and four stand like stacks of
pale shiny boxes sent home from Saks or Neiman's, strangely
unconcerned by the wild green twined at their feet.</TE>
<TE>   The sandy spice of eucalyptus is inescapable here; leaves and
sloughed off bark litter the road. For all its twists and turns, it
is a fast road. The only difficulty is the sudden entrance into the
belly of Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Like turning away from a late winter sunset to look back into the
electric blaze of the office, it takes a while for the eyes to
adjust.</TE>

<HD>He's Pitting His Pen Against Their Swords</HD>
<DH>Culture* Egyptian-born actor has put his career on hold to
write a screenplay he hopes will stem the slaughter in the Middle
East.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day is young, but Sean Delon has a weary expression that covers
his face like three-day stubble. His intense green eyes are
bloodshot. His broad shoulders sag as he slumps behind an old-model
Macintosh, pecking away at his keyboard while Palestinian territories
burn, while Jerusalem seethes, while another chance for a Middle East
peace settlement turns to a handful of dust.</LD>
<LD>   Though he's half a world removed from the bloodshed and the broken
vows, Delon seems to be living in a separate time zone from the rest
of Los Angeles. After dozing off at 4 a.m., he's already back at work
on a project that may never come to pass, a screenplay on a subject
few people in Hollywood want to touch, or even talk about.</LD>
<LD>   Ask why this 20-something Egyptian-born actor would put a
promising TV and film career on hold to pursue such a quixotic quest,
and Delon will let loose a torrent of opinion: about the "true"
meaning of jihad, the failed leadership of Yasser Arafat and Ariel
Sharon, and the treacherous geopolitical crosswinds of our time.</LD>
<TE>   Then he'll relate his recurring dream--"obsession" might be a
better word--about how his script-in-progress, "No Other Way," an
updating of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" set in the Middle East,
could help stem the ongoing slaughter in an agonized corner of the
world. After growing up in Egypt, a country that 23 years ago traded
the sword for the olive branch in dealing with its Jewish neighbor,
Delon is convinced that peace could still be brokered between Israel,
the Palestinians and other aggrieved parties now intent on wiping
each other off the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Just how a mere movie might contribute to such a historic outcome,
where generations of politicians and diplomats have failed, is a
question Delon leaves open-ended. "People don't like politics. They
find it boring," he says in staccato, slightly unsteady English. "But
if you deliver the message of peace, of Israeli and Arab living
together, they're going to believe it. Jews believe in the Promised
Land, and they're not going to give it up. And the Muslims believe in
the struggle, and they're not going to give it up. So the solution is
to live in peace."</TE>
<TE>   Simple, right? In his heart, Delon knows it's not. But his actions
tell a different story.</TE>
<TE>   On any given day, of course, there are hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of people out hustling scripts in Hollywood. Some hunger
for money, others for power, a few for a kind of immortality. Delon's
motives skew differently. Time and again, in conversation, his lofty
ideas and ambitious talk circle back to a single word: Peace. There
must be peace between Arabs and Jews, Delon says to anyone who will
listen, anyone who will take his insistent phone calls and incessant
faxes--movie studio executives, casting directors, newspaper
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   If the politicians can't see the light, he says, go around them!
If the media won't put out pro-peace messages, make your own
counter-propaganda! "I will try to meet Dan Rather or Barbara
Walters," he says. "I'll send e-mail or something. That's America!
One day you're nobody, and then.... " Delon lets the thought trail
off. "I always pray to God. God give me a sign, keep going, keep
going."</TE>
<TE>   But Delon, who's been living in the United States since coming
here to study in 1988, isn't pinning all his hopes on agents. He also
has a patron: His best friend, David Degan, the scion of a family of
wealthy Iranian Jews, who has pledged half a million dollars to the
project. "This guy inspires me a lot," says Degan, 28, during an
interview at his family's Bel-Air estate. "When this guy puts his
mind on something he gets it done, and no one gets it done the way he
gets it done."</TE>
<TE>   For months, Delon has been trying to get an audience with Jack
Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, to plead
for support for his project--so far without luck. Earlier this year
he even fired off a letter to George W. Bush, urging the President to
invite young Israelis and Arabs to the White House to show they're
"united here in America."</TE>
<TE>   And if he can't get his screenplay made in Hollywood, he's
resolved to film it in Egypt, where his face is recognizable from
soap operas and feature films such as Hatim Fareed's indie comedy
"Sweet Guys," about a group of young Egyptians partying in the shadow
of the Pyramids on New Year's Eve, 1999. "I'm not Tom Cruise," he
says of his stature in Egypt, "but I'm established there."</TE>
<TE>   To some, Delon's fantasy of boosting Middle East peace through a
big-screen romance may seem daring and idealistic, to others naive or
self-serving. Yet for Delon, who was born Hashem Ali in the ancient
port city of Alexandria and raised a Muslim, the medium is less
important than the message. If he thought holding a carwash in his
backyard would make Arafat and Sharon lay down their arms and kiss in
the streets of Ramallah, he might be outside in his shorts with the
garden hose right now. "Peace is something I believe," he says,
"acting is my career."</TE>
<TE>   In the five years since he wrote "No Other Way," Delon has
received only a few nibbles from casting agents and a polite "thanks,
but no thanks" from one major studio. Despite the delays, Hussein
Fahmi, an Egyptian actor, director and former president of the Cairo
International Film Festival, believes Delon has the stuff to make
good on his plan. "He has the ideas, and he has the dream. He's a
sweet person, and he's talented."</TE>
<TE>   Some of his former U.S. teachers concur that Delon's project is in
keeping with the earnest, charismatic, young man they remember. "He
always impressed me as somebody who was genuinely genuine, who was
the real thing," says David Grant, former president of Orange Coast
College in Costa Mesa, which Delon attended in the early '90s (and
where he was once voted homecoming king).</TE>
<TE>   Robert Scales, dean of the USC School of Theatre, strikes a more
cautious note. "I think it [the script] is fascinating--if he can
pull it off," he says. "I don't question his abilities; I think he is
very quick, but I'm not confident of his follow-throughs on the big,
long hauls."</TE>
<TE>   Though "No Other Way" may not be the hottest commercial property
since "The Lord of the Rings," it doesn't skimp on those elements
that sell tickets: romance, comic relief and a stiff shot of
violence. Its main characters, Omar Ramsey, a 26-year-old Egyptian
student, and Sarah Solomon, daughter of a fictional Israeli prime
minister, are ardent utopians pitting themselves against hawkish
politicians, cynical journalists and several thousand years' worth of
bloody quid pro quo. It's easy to imagine the poster art.</TE>
<TE>   With a laugh, Delon concedes a more-than-passing resemblance
between him and the headstrong, idealistic Omar. For a female co-star
he'd love to get Penelope Cruz, he says offhandedly, but would settle
for Jennifer Connelly, who won an Oscar for "A Beautiful Mind." And
maybe Michael Douglas for the Israeli prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Delon's ambitious talk might ring hollow without his friend
Degan's personal fortune to back it up. Ironically, if the two men
had met in the Middle East, their first encounter might not have been
so amicable.</TE>
<TE>   Degan says he met Delon while working out at the gym at USC, where
Delon transferred after three years at Orange Coast College. Degan,
nee Azadegan, has been living in the United States since the Iranian
revolution broke out in November 1979. His family relocated first to
New York, then to Los Angeles in 1983. Several of Degan's relatives
were killed during Iran's violent conversion from the Shah's
pro-Western dictatorship to the Islamic theocracy of the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini. "All I knew was Muslims were the people who killed
my relatives," Degan says.</TE>
<TE>   Looking beyond their different faiths and backgrounds, Delon and
Degan quickly became best friends. Last year, Degan invited Delon to
move in with him and his mother (Degan's father died in 1989), in
part so Delon would have space to work on rewriting and shopping
around his script. The two men also hope to set up a charity aimed at
promoting Arab-Jewish friendship by bringing Israeli and Palestinian
children together at summer camps in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "When I met Sean, I realized he's just like me," says Degan, who
runs an import-export business. "In fact, the religion isn't that
different either."</TE>
<TE>   Like his friend, Delon refuses to accept that a deep cultural
chasm divides the Islamic world from Israel and the West. He insists
that the Koran's concept of jihad refers to an individual believer's
private spiritual struggle, not to a literal war against "infidels."
He describes fellow Egyptian Mohamed Atta, the accused Sept. 11 lead
hijacker, as a brainwashed "loser."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, Delon has revised his script to incorporate
references to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, trying to make the action as
up-to-the-minute as possible. He'll sometimes ask Degan to read over
his shoulder: Am I taking sides? Am I getting the Jewish perspective
across? "I try to be fair," Delon says. "I know not everyone is going
to be pleased."</TE>
<TE>   He also knows peace prophets aren't always regarded as heroes. His
idol, former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, concluded the Camp David
Peace accords with former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in
1978, ending years of war between the two nations; three years later,
he was assassinated by Muslim militants. "If Sadat didn't come,"
Delon says, "maybe David and I would be fighting each other on the
border of Sinai and Israel."</TE>
<TE>   It's a breezy Friday night in Westwood. Delon and Degan are
cooling their heels at Habibi Cafe, where the mixed-ethnic clientele
suck on hookah pipes and boogie along with the belly dancers. Delon
likes the vibrant montage of Egyptian, Lebanese and Israeli students
from UCLA, Armenians and Russians from the Eastside, and everything
in between. In colloquial Arabic, "habibi" means "sweetie" or
"darling," and one of the cafe's brick walls is covered with
translations. "I'm always wondering why people are killing each other
there, and here everyone is cool," says Delon, surveying the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Another month has slipped by. More Palestinians have been killed
by Israeli guns; more Israeli civilians have been massacred in
suicide bombings. Degan is about to catch a plane for Las Vegas,
while Delon remains in town, working his contacts, mentally mapping
out his cinematic epic. "Hopefully there won't be one movie about
peace, there'll be 10 movies," he says. "And maybe in 10 years we
won't be talking about the movie, we'll be talking about peace."</TE>
<TE>   Romantic? Certainly. Improbable? Just turn on CNN. But impossible?
Delon has thrown himself in the middle of long odds before.</TE>
<TE>   During the filming of "Sweet Guys," one scene called for him to
jump into the Nile River, fully clothed, at 3 in the morning. "I
didn't know the Nile water is heavy, it's not salty," he says. "Plus
it comes from Luxor; it has dirt in it. Plus it was like 45 meters
deep. I was swimming against the current. I wanted to go back to the
boat. I couldn't go back."</TE>
<TE>   An assistant could've aided him, but, Delon says, his ego wouldn't
allow it. "I said, 'God, please help!'--all this takes just a few
seconds. Suddenly, I feel my hand touching the side of the boat. And
everybody was clapping! They didn't know I was really dying! They
thought I was a good actor!"</TE>
<TE>   Delon smiles. "To be an actor, you have to be a little bit crazy,
you know?"</TE>

<DH>A celebrated artist uses Shakespeare to stir kids' creative
juices in a workshop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For most kids, spring break is a time to hit the malls, the beaches
or just kick it with friends. But for 16 Santa Monica middle and high
school students, spring break meant studying Shakespeare and creating
museum-worthy art.</LD>
<LD>   The kids were a mix of serious art students and the simply curious
who wanted to participate in a free three-day workshop, organized by
the Santa Monica Museum of Art and held at nearby Virginia Avenue
Park. The payoff for giving up their free time? The chance to work
with New York artist and arts educator Tim Rollins, who is something
of a celebrity in the art world.</LD>
<LD>   The 46-year-old Maine native has been teaching art to at-risk
youths in the South Bronx for 20 years; he came to Santa Monica at
the request of the museum as part of its educational outreach
program. Using important literary works as touchstones for creating,
Rollins and the Kids of Survival, as his Bronx group came to be
known, worked as a collaborative. Their canvases were key passages of
the texts themselves, whether it was Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The
Scarlet Letter" or Franz Kafka's unfinished novel "Amerika."</LD>
<TE>   Today, works by Tim Rollins &amp; K.O.S. are in the collections of
such institutions as the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., and
the Tate Gallery in London. Rollins leads workshops around the world
and was profiled in an Emmy award-winning documentary.</TE>
<TE>   But the kids in last week's workshop hardly knew what to make of
Rollins at first, in his black Versace suit, black shirt and black
brimmed hat, a steady uniform over the course of the class. His
teaching style, which might be described as rock 'n'
roll-evangelist-disciplinarian-cheerleader, required a leap of faith
among the students. There would be no goofing off, no "can'ts" and no
raised hands. Instead, answers would be yelled out--not spoken;
yelled.</TE>
<TE>   "You may call me Tim unless you start acting like children," he
said. With this, copies of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" were
distributed. Rollins introduced the text using a loose Socratic
method. In less than five minutes, every student in the room knew
where the play was written (London), when it was first published
(1600), the theater in which it was first performed (the Globe), and
where the play was set (Athens), and they were yelling out the
answers in a cacophonous chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the group went through the list of characters, their
relationships, and the general plot, which, for those who can't quite
recall their 10th-grade reading assignments, revolves around a real
world and a fairy world, and the intersection of the two.</TE>
<TE>   The class then watched the beginning of the 1968 film on tape,
pausing to memorize key lines. "If you can know a Britney Spears
song, you can certainly know Shakespeare," Rollins said. He stopped
the tape after Oberon, king of the fairies, sends his attendant,
Puck, on a mission to find a magical "love-in-idleness" flower. "The
juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid/Will make man or woman madly
dote/Upon the next live creature that it sees," says Oberon.</TE>
<TE>   Rollins asked the students to draw the flower. "But this has to be
a totally amazing, fantastic flower." Don't draw a rose or a daisy,
he commanded. "Just draw. Get rid of yourself."</TE>
<TE>   By this time, nearly everyone in the room was on board, but there
were a couple holdouts. "I don't like drawing flowers," said
12-year-old Juan Perez. Earnest Richardson, 13, seconded that view.
"That's girlie," he said. A couple seconds later, Rollins took a call
on his cell phone from "Rick," a K.O.S. colleague in New York. He
spoke to Rick a few seconds then passed the phone to Earnest. (This
is one of several tricks in Rollins' substantial bag.) Earnest and
the mysterious Rick spoke for a couple minutes. Whatever was said
seemed to have an effect because Earnest started drawing. Juan still
had his doubts.</TE>
<TE>   On Day 2, the group continued with the flower image. Eventually,
they worked in calligraphy ink using paintbrushes on very thin,
archival Aqaba paper, which they folded in half. Whatever they
painted bled through to the second layer, creating a mirror image
suggestive of the two worlds in the play.</TE>
<TE>   On the final day, each of the 12 students chose a favorite flower
from those they had created. They pasted the flower and its twin over
a particularly relevant passage from the play speaking to
"imagination" and "the poet's pen" that Rollins had copied onto
handsome 81/2-by-11-inch cotton paper. Rollins signed each of the 12
works alongside the students' signatures. The pieces will be on
display at the Santa Monica Museum of Art through April 12.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an honor," said Clarence Fujiyoshi, 17. "Probably I'll never
get my work in a museum in the next millennium."</TE>
<TE>   At the conclusion of the exhibition, the students will get to take
home their individual pieces. "I highly recommend you take care of
them," suggested Rollins. "And I highly recommend you frame them
because they are of value" (Rollins ventures at least $1,000 apiece).
He did have one last request: "Just don't sell them on Ebay."</TE>

<LD>How often do you hear "eat a balanced diet and get plenty of
exercise"? Well, that saying also holds true for the elephants at the
Los Angeles Zoo. Maybe some of you have been lucky enough to have
seen the elephants exercising during one of your visits.</LD>
<LD>   About 9 each morning, elephants Gita and Ruby begin their daily
exercises under the guidance of their animal keepers. The elephants
stretch and walk at least 16 laps around their exhibit, which is
about one mile. They also stand up on large rocks to work different
muscles, and push and hold logs of different sizes to work the neck
and trunk. Did you know that the elephant trunk has more than 100,000
muscles?</LD>
<LD>   Although their regimen sounds rigorous, they also have time to
have fun and stay fit. Gita, Ruby and their keepers sometimes play a
game of soccer. They will kick a soccer ball back and forth to one
another. Just like you, they play sports to stay healthy.</LD>
<TE>   This workout plan was started several years ago when the keepers
realized that the elephants were overweight. Gita weighed more than
10,000 pounds, and Ruby's weight was nearly that. Today, Gita is a
healthy 9,400 pounds, and Ruby weighs in at 9,200 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   For Gita and Ruby, the best part of the exercise routine comes at
the end when they receive a cool shower and a meal perfect for
elephants. It includes a daily diet of 150 pounds of hay, carrots,
apples, bread and other treats.</TE>
<TE>   This exercise plan is part of the zoo's elephant management
program, which was recently recognized as a "model" program by a
national association that represents zoos and aquariums in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about elephants by visiting Gita, an Asian
elephant, and Ruby, an African elephant, at the Los Angeles Zoo.
Elephants Tara and Billy also are on exhibit. Learn more about the
zoo by visiting its Web site at www.la zoo.org.</TE>

<DH>Two comedy writers have penned novels in which a happy
ending is not the point.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's what every single woman in pursuit of happiness and love
needs: a few tolerant friends, a sense of humor, a positive attitude,
a good job and an astute therapist. Here's what successful female
comedy writers need: to spin stories of the romantic disasters 21st
century women experience as they stumble through adulthood.</LD>
<LD>   Two first-time novelists, Merrill Markoe and Jill A. Davis, whose
resumes each include stints on the staff of "Late Show With David
Letterman," have gone literary to expand upon the lament that a good
man is hard to find, even though the search can be amusing.</LD>
<LD>   In each book, the therapeutically savvy reader will recognize some
characters with abandonment issues, card-carrying narcissists and
others who act out repetition compulsions. Again. Just about everyone
suffers from a glut of stupid advice to the lovelorn.</LD>
<TE>   Five years ago, British author Helen Fielding published "Bridget
Jones's Diary" (Viking), introducing a witty, libidinous,
chain-smoking career dieter who outgrows her itch for bad boys and
finds true love. The genre has grown wildly popular and has shown
remarkable staying power through Fielding's sequel and a slew of
similarly themed novels.</TE>
<TE>   Although the heroines of Davis' "Girls' Poker Night" (Random
House) and Markoe's "It's My F---ing Birthday" (Villard) are
ostensibly looking for Mr. Right, their creators feel a happy ending
is beside the point. In Los Angeles to read a "Girls' Poker Night"
chapter at a Spoken Interludes program at the Tempest Supper Club,
Davis, 32, says, "I didn't want people to think that my book was
about getting the guy."</TE>
<TE>   Markoe had a similar agenda. "I wanted to write about being
alone," she says, "because it seems no one ever accepts that as a
reasonable alternative, and I know a lot of people who live alone,
and there are good things about it. When you live by yourself, all
your annoying habits are gone. Nobody complains. It's interesting how
everything you do is fine."</TE>
<TE>   Like most of Markoe's remarks, the observation is funny, in a sly,
true, painful way. She talks about the book at her lived-in Malibu
home, surrounded by her four dogs and two "step-dogs," the latter
pair brought to the blended canine family by her boyfriend, musician
and writer Andy Prieboy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's My F---ing Birthday" is Markoe's fifth book and first work
of fiction. She won four Emmy awards for writing the Letterman show
and secretly dreads that her obituary will identify her as the
inventor of Stupid Pet Tricks or worse, Letterman's ex-girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1988, when her professional and personal association with
the comedian ended, Markoe has lived in L.A., writing humorous
essays, columns, scripts, television pilots and offering commentary
on local news programs and comedy shows such as "Politically
Incorrect." She signed on as a consultant during the second season of
HBO's "Sex and the City" and has penned an episode.</TE>
<TE>   Selecting a Familiar Subject</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the daunting prospect of writing a novel, which her
agent suggested was a more salable format than collections of short
comic pieces, Markoe made the task less intimidating by choosing a
familiar subject.</TE>
<TE>   "I wound up writing about my parents and using the voice of the
women I've been hanging out with for the last 10 years," she says.
"The single women I know sing a song of hope, battered wishes and
eternal self-improvement as a way out of the constant battering. That
voice comes through in all that advice and support women give each
other. When you get discouraged, one of your friends will say, 'When
one door closes, another opens.' That's complete hogwash. I've
noticed that when one door closes, another door closes. And then you
have two closed doors."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the unmarried, never-named L.A. art teacher at the
center of Markoe's narrative hates birthdays. Anyone would, if an
annual celebration included a dinner with critical, competitive
parents whose gift was inevitably the ugliest, most unbecoming outfit
on the planet. Kirkus Reviews deemed the book "classy stuff that
deserves tons of flowers from dazed and satisfied readers."</TE>
<TE>   The flowers are a reference to the expensive bouquets the teacher
receives every birthday from her ex-boyfriend. She tries to parse the
meaning of his gesture, believing that his choice of blooms are a
mystery meant to be solved. "Women think that men speak in code,"
Markoe says. "I'm used to hearing a lot of conversations among women
full of neurotic hand wringing and analysis--a lot of terror of
saying or doing the wrong thing. If he said, 'See you later,' did he
mean he'll see you later, or a lot later? I've learned in life that
if a guy wants to be with you, he will be with you. There is no code
to it."</TE>
<TE>   The smart woman's needy alter ego, who looks up the symbolism of
yellow tulips and roses on the Internet, is called the dumb girl. The
year of her 40th birthday, the narrator sees her dumb girl reflection
in Monica Lewinsky. "It seemed to me she was dying for the sins of
dumb and crazy girls of all ages everywhere," Marko writes. "Never
before had I seen the paradigm of crazy dumb girl syndrome so
publicly X-rayed, examined, dissected and analyzed. I saw myself in
her in a million different ways that were painful and embarrassing to
acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "Starting with how she obsessed endlessly about the details of
each encounter with her boyfriend, the president, as though he was a
dude she met at a dance club who was speaking to her in secret code."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' narrator, Ruby Capote, lives on the opposite coast, but she
and the group of friends she plays poker with on Wednesday nights
have their own self-destructive dumb-girl personas.</TE>
<TE>   Ruby writes a humor column for a New York newspaper and falls for
a managing editor more adorable and adoring than any boss found in
the real world of journalism. He's a nice guy, though, and dumb girls
don't let themselves stay with the good ones, at least until their
therapists show them the wisdom that hides within.</TE>
<TE>   Lest anyone charge Davis with basing her protagonist's job on
Markoe or TV's Carrie Bradshaw, the author once wrote a humor column
for a small Massachusetts newspaper. She sent samples of it to the
head writer of the Letterman show after Markoe had moved on; the two
have never met) and, at 25, was hired as the only woman on the
writing staff. She stayed for five years and received five Emmy
nominations.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved that job, and I worked with a great group of people,"
Davis says. "But writing something longer was one of my goals, and
getting to work around 10 and going home between 9 and 11 made it
hard to have a life."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has a way of making 12-hour workdays and other impressive
feats appear easy. Even though half of her female friends are single,
and she believes their complaint that there are no good men to be
found in New York is accurate, two years ago she married a venture
capitalist she met on a blind date.</TE>
<TE>   On the way to finishing her novel, Davis detoured to write a
series of dramatic monologues for HBO, commissioned when they read
her first short story. Then she knocked off a few screenplays and two
TV pilots. Both pilots sold and one was filmed, starring Tracy Pollan
as a single woman living in New York.</TE>
<TE>   There's a hall-of-mirrors quality to the risks each writer took
trying fiction. They faced some of their demons as their characters
learned to do the same. "For too long, Ruby was living in the fantasy
that she wouldn't be disappointed if she didn't take any risks,"
Davis says.</TE>
<TE>   The most difficult thing Davis has done was the book. "You put a
lot of yourself into scripts, but there are so many hands involved
that your work changes a lot and evolves into something else, so you
don't feel as connected.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was writing jokes for Dave, I was fully invested in that,
but, at the end of the day, he was the guy who had to go out and make
it work. This is the biggest risk I've ever taken, because writing a
novel is very personal. It's a work of fiction, but there are seeds
of truth throughout it."</TE>
<TE>   Ruby hides behind her humor. "Writing funny is a protection
mechanism," Davis says. "Ruby uses it to deflect things that get too
serious, to shield herself from people who get too close, to make
things seem less important than they are."</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Markoe both know well the technique of using comedy to
camouflage feelings. The self-absorbed mother in Markoe's novel is a
portrait of her own, she admits. The woman is monstrously funny,
except to anyone who had a similar parent. "The nice thing about
writing is it's a way to explain and protect yourself from stuff
that's hurtful. All that screaming in my family--I make sense of it
by making fun of it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Comedy as a Form of Defense</TE>
<TE>   Pain is a reliable comic source. But subtract the humor, and all
that remains is the sting. "The whole thing about comedy is it's a
form of defense," Markoe says. "Being funny keeps you from being
vulnerable. But I've learned that the best comedy really includes
vulnerability. I don't mind being vulnerable if it includes being
funny. In writing this book, I scared myself sometimes when I didn't
add the punch line. I made myself terrified and nauseous writing
about my mother. I came to realize that terror in art is what you're
supposed to head for. In life, you should run away from terror. In
art, you run toward it, because that's where the growth is."</TE>
<TE>   Talking to readers at book signings and reading their e-mail,
Davis has discovered that her fans include septuagenarian widowers
and 42-year-old bachelors, as well as women from all age groups. Many
identify with the struggles of Ruby and her friends. "When I hear a
man in his 40s say he has the same issues as women I know in their
30s, I'm not surprised. People are trying not to make the mistakes
their parents made; they don't have a clue how to make a relationship
work."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the singleton genre simply amped up the humor always
lurking under the tragic surface of romantic agony. But its
popularity might be traced to the way it reflects some of the strong
currents flowing through contemporary life.</TE>
<TE>   "These books are part of an exploding genre, because there's a
demand," Davis says. "I'm not worried that people will get tired of
them. Each one is different, with its own internal life. I mean, look
how many spy novels have been written. There are a million of them,
and the guy's a spy in each one. Do we care?"</TE>

<HD>The Art of Growing Pear Varieties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADRIAN HIGGINS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 300 hundred years ago, a court painter to the Medici
dynasty assembled all the pear varieties he could find growing in
Tuscany and recorded them for his patron.</LD>
<LD>   Pears that were steely gray, yellow, green, blue, blush; pears the
size of potatoes, pears in cherry-like clusters; pears the shape and
color of apples. Hundreds of mouth-watering pears, a total of 115
different varieties, assembled by the artist Bartolomeo Bimbi.</LD>
<LD>   The painting, in its ornate carved frame, is one of the stars of
the current exhibition "The Flowering of Florence" at the National
Gallery of Art in Washington. The show features three painters and
other artists and craftsmen working to chronicle the Medicis'
interest in art and science during the Renaissance.</LD>
<TE>   "Pears" and other works by Bimbi (1648-1729) stand out as
extraordinary, said co-curator Gretchen Hirschauer. The fruits are
shown in a classical temple, glowing like jewels against a dark
background.</TE>
<TE>   The fruit Bimbi painted is believed to have come from the 14
villas that the Medicis owned in and around Florence, and may have
come too from the orchards of other Tuscan aristocrats, said Lucia
Tongiorgi Tomasi, the exhibition's other curator.</TE>
<TE>   Pears had been grown and cherished in Italy since at least Roman
times, but the Renaissance gave form to the villa orchard at a time
of great interest in botany and fruit cultivation, spawning the
creation of so many varieties.</TE>
<TE>   Pears, like apples, produce seedlings from pits that are all
different from one another. If a gardener discovers a seedling that
bears fabulous fruit, he must replicate it by taking cuttings to grow
into trees.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Bell, a fruit scientist with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, said the Medici orchards probably predated the grafting
of trees onto quince rootstock, meaning the trees were large, the
spacing between them was as much as 25 feet and a relatively large
amount of land was needed to raise them. "They were probably growing
them at a much wider spacing than they do today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The French aristocracy, whose gardeners perfected the art of
training pears on walls, had at least as many varieties, he said. And
today?</TE>
<TE>   The American consumer is lucky to find any beyond the four
European pear varieties that dominate the market: Bartlett, Anjou,
Bosc and Comice. "Some of that is driven by the realities of the
marketplace," said Bell, a research horticulturist at the Appalachian
Fruit Research Station in Kearneysville, W.Va. "There's only so much
grocery shelf space."</TE>
<TE>   This paucity is in contrast to the number of pear varieties that
can be grown in America. The current fruit register of the American
Pomological Society lists more than 200 varieties of European pears.</TE>
<TE>   The society's 19th century founder, Marshall Pinkney Wilder,
outdid the Medicis and Dauphins combined. In his suburban garden in
Dorchester, Mass., he planted and developed a pear orchard
containing, at its peak, 800 varieties. According to the society's
Web site, "during his life he tested 1,200 cultivars of pears and
exhibited 404 in 1873."</TE>
<TE>   The comeback of the pear may rest with small commercial orchards,
"and there's quite an active amateur orchard movement in this
country," said Bell.</TE>

<HD>Kate Shelley: Heroine of Honey Creek</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The station was only a mile from the house but it might as well have
been a hundred in this storm. If that wasn't enough, Kate had to
worry about crossing the Des Moines River, now that the Honey Creek
bridge was down. The Des Moines River was huge and there was only one
way to cross. She would have to walk across the long, wooden railroad
bridge.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first bridge the Midnight Express will use, Kate thought.
Then it will pick up speed on its way to the Honey Creek bridge.
Except, there isn't a Honey Creek bridge anymore! It's gone, swept
away in the storm.</LD>
<LD>   Kate pushed on. Wind tore at her slicker. Rain pelted her face.
But she didn't stop.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, she stood in front of the bridge. No one was supposed to
walk across. Only trains could cross because there was no space on
either side of the tracks. If a train rushed onto the track toward
her, there would be no place to go. No place but the rushing, angry
river below.</TE>
<TE>   Kate took a deep breath. It wouldn't be easy. There were only
narrow pieces of wood called ties on which to walk. One slip and she
could fall between them.</TE>
<TE>   She took another deep breath and stepped onto the bridge. Suddenly
the wind blew out her lantern. She was in darkness now.</TE>
<TE>   Kate knew she couldn't walk across in the darkness. She would have
to crawl about 400 feet to the other side. That was as long as their
neighbor's cornfield.</TE>
<TE>   She listened for a train whistle. She looked for an engine's
light.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, no sound but the wind and the rain.</TE>
<TE>   Kate crawled onto the bridge. The wet ties were slippery. Her
thick, woolen skirt was soaked. It grew heavy around her legs.
Suddenly her skirt caught on the splintery edge of a wooden tie. It
pulled one of her legs down between the ties. She screamed and
grabbed the tie in front of her.</TE>
<TE>   Her fingers slipped and splinters tore her skin. She caught her
breath, then pulled her leg up and onto the surface again.</TE>
<TE>   Kate was so tired now, more tired than she had ever been. And
cold. It was July and she was freezing. She thought of her warm bed,
her warm house and Ma and the little kids. Then she thought of all
the people on the train. They all needed her. She could not give up
now.</TE>
<TE>   She took a deep breath and continued to crawl to the other side of
the bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Will Kate make it?</TE>

<HD>The New Wave in Radios</HD>
<DH>Marketers believe 100-station satellite car units will get
a warm reception.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first blush, the idea of satellite radio in a car is about as
exciting as satellite television at home--100 channels, sure, but are
any worth tuning to?</LD>
<LD>   In a week with a car equipped to receive XM Radio--the first of
two competing satellite systems to hit the market--my wife and I
passed on the half-dozen talk channels, the sports programs and Raw,
a channel featuring uncensored hard-core hip hop with lyrics we can't
even hint at in a family newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   But we did find lots to listen to. That's the appeal of satellite
radio--programming so far is generally pretty high-class, and there's
enough variety to keep almost everyone happy. Everything from Radio
Disney for kids to live interviews and mini-concerts by top recording
artists.</LD>
<TE>   And, of course, you can listen all the way across country without
losing the signal or changing channels.</TE>
<TE>   Still, XM's auditors recently said the company needed a big influx
of cash to ensure survival, and though XM execs say that's not a
problem, you might want to take it into consideration when pondering
a decision that requires an initial capital outlay of $300 to $800.
On the upside, XM reported this week that it signed 76,000 paying
customers in its first quarter of operation, about 6,000 more than
previously forecast.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't think satellite radio was worth the start-up costs and
$9.99 monthly subscription fee--until I turned in the XM-equipped
Cadillac DeVille we had been driving for a week.</TE>
<TE>   (General Motors and Honda are part-owners of XM, and GM is the
first to equip some of its cars with satellite-receiving radios. XM
has just one competitor, Sirius Radio, partly owned by Ford and
DaimlerChrysler, but it has yet to launch in California.)</TE>
<TE>   When I hopped in my own car, with its measly selection of six
preset FM channels, it took about five minutes of listening to the
same old L.A. stations with their same old playlists for me to start
missing some of those satellite channels. Even my 10-disc CD changer
wasn't very interesting, although it might help if I remembered to
change the CDs once in a while.</TE>
<TE>   So, yes, satellite radio sounds good, assuming you can justify the
expense. The ads all stress variety, sound clarity and affordability.
"Less than $10 a month," they say.</TE>
<TE>   It's just a penny less than $10, though. And that's after you pay
a sizable chunk of change for the hardware--and $14.95 for a
connection fee.</TE>
<TE>   As with any automotive audio equipment, it pays to shop around.</TE>
<TE>   The radio and TV ads for XM talk about radios for $299 and mention
that additional equipment might be needed. Indeed, you'll need an
antenna, a satellite signal receiving unit and, unless you're really,
really good, a professional installer.</TE>
<TE>   I found installation fees ranging from $50 to $150, satellite
receiving units from $199 to $299, antennas from $49 (after rebate)
to $99 and radios from $159 to $399.</TE>
<TE>   You can save a little money by adding satellite radio reception to
an existing car stereo system: The receiver and tuning element, which
mounts much like the faceplate of a remote CD changer, run from $249
to $299.</TE>
<TE>   If you buy an XM-capable replacement stereo for your car, you get
all the bells and whistles you would expect in a new audio system,
including in-dash CD player, and you'll spend $199 to $399.</TE>
<TE>   That's unless you find a special, as I did at one Circuit City
store that was advertising an "out of the box" deal--a model that had
been unpacked but not installed--for $159. But whatever you pay for
the stereo, you still need a satellite signal receiver, priced at
$199. And an antenna, of which there are several models, none
particularly good-looking.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City's Antwon Baylor, a car audio specialist in Orange,
said a window-mount model his store sells for $99 was hot because it
requires no drilling.</TE>
<TE>   But Ed Majangos, a salesman at a nearby Al &amp; Ed's Autosound store,
says his customers did not like the window-mount system because the
antenna is "like three times bigger and really ugly." His store sells
a roof-mount model for $99. It looks like the broken-off stub of a
fat CB radio antenna and requires a hole in the sheet metal to feed
the wiring through. Circuit City's price for a similar roof-mount
antenna is $79, and there was a $30 rebate when I was looking.</TE>
<TE>   Installation prices vary from store to store, and the best rule of
thumb is that you'll probably get what you pay for. But if you know
that the less expensive place does good work, then by all means go
for it. The antennas all require wiring to be run up to the roof
under the A-pillar's plastic cladding, and most also involve running
wires under the roof liner.</TE>
<TE>   Any satellite radio shopper would be well advised to sign on to
the providers' Web sites (www.xmradio.com and www.siriusradio.com) to
look for specials and rebates that occasionally are offered.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the kind of system you end up with, satellite radio
has a few quirks.</TE>
<TE>   There are 100 channels, but aside from those you program into your
radio presets, you can't get from Channel 1 to Channel 100 without
traveling through Channels 2 through 99 as well. Other than the
presets, there's no system that allows you to punch in a channel
number and go there.</TE>
<TE>   And the signals don't penetrate into parking garages or through
tunnel roofs, so prepare to lose sound from time to time as you
travel under freeway bridges and railroad overpasses.</TE>
<TE>   We also got spotty reception driving alongside an elevated freeway
onramp one day--apparently the satellite was at such a low angle that
the tall concrete-and-steel structure blocked its signal for a bit.
True, we're talking outages of half a second to a second, not great
long chunks of time, but when it's a favorite tune or the punch line
to a good joke that gets chopped up, it can get annoying.</TE>
<TE>   There's also the occasional lapse when the signal is lost or the
radio is turned on after being off for a bit while the system
searches for the signal--satellite television users will be familiar
with the "searching for signal" delay.</TE>
<TE>   Even though they are charging you to listen to it, satellite radio
is not commercial-free. About 60 of XM's stations air ads. Many of
the stations pepper their musical programming with chatter from DJs
who can be just as irritating as those who interrupt the music on FM.
And some of the programs are canned and repeat on a regular basis--I
found myself listening to the same musical selections on one of the
rock stations two mornings in a row. That's when having 99 other
programs really comes in handy.</TE>
<TE>   (XM spokesman Chance Patterson said repetitive programming from
playlists is more likely on the 30 channels XM buys from outside
providers than on the channels it programs itself. )</TE>
<TE>   Finally, radios that get the XM signal cannot get the Sirius
signal, and vice versa. The incompatibility problem is being worked
on, but unless a universal system is developed, consumers will have
to pick a system and stick with it--or spend a lot to change radios.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Alpine, Sony and Pioneer make XM systems for the
aftermarket. Delco makes the system that is now in select Cadillacs
and Isuzus and due in a total of 24 GM models next year.
(Announcements about satellite radio-equipped models from Honda,
Volkswagen and Audi are expected shortly.)</TE>
<TE>   Sirius users have the choice of systems from Kenwood or Jensen.</TE>
<TE>   Because it isn't available here yet, we didn't try Sirius, but its
Web site's program log shows content that is quite similar to XM's.</TE>
<TE>   Final words: Satellite radio in the car is an idea whose time has
arrived. It is especially great for those addicted to the niche music
that commercial FM no longer supplies and for road warriors who spend
days on end in the car.</TE>
<TE>   As for me, I've got way too many other things to spend money on
right now. I'll probably put the satellite radio on hold until I buy
a new car with a factory-installed system.</TE>

<HD>Honda's Hybrid Civic Priced Under $21,000</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Honda has priced its new hybrid Civic, the third gas-electric car to
go on sale in the U.S., at $19,500 for the manual
transmission-equipped model and $20,500 for the version with
constantly variable (automatic) transmission.</LD>
<LD>   The five-passenger hybrid Civic combines a 1.3-liter gasoline
engine with a small electric motor that provides an additional boost
when needed and instant starting power that enables a sophisticated
engine management computer to shut down the gas engine when the car
is stopped at idle.</LD>
<LD>   EPA Weighs In on Fuel Economy</LD>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency has finally issued its fuel
economy ratings for the hybrid Civic, crediting the five-speed manual
transmission with 46 miles per gallon in city driving and 51 mpg on
the highway. The CVT-equipped Civic hybrid is rated at 48 city and 47
highway (the automatic increases fuel economy in stop-and-go driving
by eliminating energy-wasting shifts between gear ratios, but isn't
as efficient as a manual at prolonged speeds).</TE>
<TE>   Most drivers know that it takes a superhuman effort, though, to
achieve EPA mileage in real life. Honda's two-seat Insight hybrid
with manual transmission, for example, was rated at 61 mpg in city
driving and 68 mpg on the highway, but most owners report real-world
mileage averaging 55 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   Auction Winner Remains Anonymous</TE>
<TE>   The proprietors of online auction site Bidz.com report that the
Russian-built Zil-115 limousine that was offered on the site last
month (Highway 1, 3/20) drew 99 bids and sold for $28,404 to a Los
Angeles-based Israeli American businessman who bought it as a gift
for his fiancee. The winning bidder did not want to be identified.
The Zil was a 1982 model used by Soviet General Secretary Yuri
Andropov.</TE>

<HD>Auto Makers Keep Drive to Create New Models for Public in
High Gear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The economy may be slow, but auto makers are pumping out new models
with amazing speed.</LD>
<LD>   Key passenger cars unveiled at the New York International Auto
Show's media preview last week demonstrate that luxury and
performance lead the race to capture consumers' attention--and
dollars. A rundown:</LD>
<LD>   Pontiac GTO: General Motors will resurrect its famed muscle car by
importing the Monaro coupe made by Holden, the auto maker's
Australian subsidiary.</LD>
<TE>   The Monaro--boasting a six-speed manual transmission and a
5.7-liter V-8 engine with about 350 horsepower--"will be a terrific
flagship for Pontiac and heir of the GTO," said GM Vice Chairman Bob
Lutz. It also will help fill the gap left by the departure of the
Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro.</TE>
<TE>   The GTO was America's first muscle car, produced from 1964 to '74.
GM will quickly restyle the Monaro as a Pontiac and bring it in line
with U.S. safety regulations, with plans to bring about 20,000 a year
to the States starting next year.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Five Hundred: This is Ford's bid to appeal to sedan buyers
who want the higher seating position and roomier interior of a
crossover wagon or sport utility vehicle. Ford is positioning the
Five Hundred--named after the old Galaxie 500--between its Taurus
mid-size and Crown Victoria full-size sedans.</TE>
<TE>   The Five Hundred will have an "Avalon-sized interior," said Ford
division President Jim O'Connor, comparing it with the upscale Toyota
sedan.</TE>
<TE>   Mazdaspeed Protege: Mazda is introducing a turbocharged sport
version of its compact Protege sedan, the first production model to
carry the brand of its old racing program, Mazdaspeed.</TE>
<TE>   The newest Protege will have a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine, enhanced
by famed Corvette tuner Callaway Cars to deliver 170 horsepower;
performance improvements for its brakes, suspension and clutch; and a
450-watt Kenwood audio system that can play MP3 music files. Expect a
Miata version soon.</TE>
<TE>   Infiniti: The latest members of Nissan's luxury market offensive
are the Infiniti G35 coupe and M45 sedan. The rear-wheel-drive G35 is
based on the popular Nissan Skyline sold in Japan and has a 3.5-
liter, 275-horsepower V-6 power plant. It arrives this fall with
prices starting at less than $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   The M45 is an understated but powerful sedan, positioned below
Infiniti's flagship Q45 but sharing its 4.5-liter, 340-horsepower V-8
engine. Its design is meant to convey the impression that it is
carved from a single piece of stone.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes-Benz: The SL55 AMG from the German auto maker's
performance group combines luxury and performance. Powered by a
5.5-liter supercharged V-8, it packs 493 horsepower and races from
zero to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, making it the fastest production
Mercedes ever sold.</TE>
<TE>   The SL55, based on the all-new SL500, is the latest descendant of
the legendary 1954 gull-wing 300SL and completes Mercedes' lineup of
super-tuned AMG cars. Pricing for the SL55, expected to start at
about $120,000, will be as supercharged as the engine.</TE>
<TE>   BMW CS-1: On the other side of the spectrum is the CS-1, the
design study for the Bavarians' upcoming 1-Series. BMW will introduce
the line in the next couple of years to attract more young people to
its growing brand, but the company has said little more about its
plans than that.</TE>

<HD>Senate's Stall on Fuel Bill Is Another Chip Off
Antarctica's Block</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How ironic. As Washington lawmakers were complaining late last month
that soccer moms would be deprived of minivans if the nation adopted
tougher fuel economy standards for SUVs and other vehicles, chunks of
ice the size of Delaware were breaking away and disintegrating in
Antarctica.</LD>
<LD>   The collapse of ice shelves as thick as 640 feet in the coldest
continent on Earth is more evidence of global warming, scientists
suggest. Many experts insist that to protect the environment and slow
the warming trend, vehicle emissions of carbon monoxide--a gas linked
to global warming--must be reduced.</LD>
<LD>   Vehicles with poor fuel economy generally produce more carbon
monoxide than those with better economy that are driven the same
number of miles each year.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Senate had a chance to take a big step to promote better
fuel economy, but the senators dodged it.</TE>
<TE>   The fuel economy bill advocated by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.),
Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.)
would have required auto makers to manufacture vehicles that would
have a fleetwide average of 36 miles per gallon by 2015.</TE>
<TE>   That would have represented a 38% increase from the 26-mpg average
that has been in place more than two decades. It also would, over
time, have eliminated exemptions that currently allow light trucks,
including sport utility vehicles, to meet a lower average of only
20.7 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   What did get approved was an alternative bill--considered more
friendly to the auto industry--that directs the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration to set fuel standards. Those standards
would be based on their impact on vehicle safety, jobs and the
country's dependence on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   The measure was touted by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Sen.
Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.). It was Bond who worried about the fate
of soccer moms.</TE>
<TE>   Rhetoric was so shrill during the Senate debate that you'd have
thought Big Brother was going to snatch all the gas-gulping
Expeditions, Yukons and Excursions right out of owners' garages if
tougher standards had been approved.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents practically forecast economic ruin for auto makers and
the states that depend heavily on vehicle production.</TE>
<TE>   But there's evidence that the auto industry already has the
technological ability to attain higher fuel economy levels, according
to a report issued by the National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the industry and auto employee unions claim stricter fuel
standards would eliminate jobs and force consumers out of their safe
and comfortable SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   Without their minivans, soccer moms would be forced to drive "a
string of golf carts" to transport their kids to their games, said
Bond. "I don't want to tell a mom and dad in my home state they can't
get the SUV they want because Congress decided that would be a bad
choice."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of higher fuel economy did their own share of
blustering after they lost.</TE>
<TE>   "We just missed an opportunity to help make America more
competitive to help save money for our consumers and to beat back
what has been a reluctance by an industry for years," Kerry said.</TE>
<TE>   The nation "will have to bow down to OPEC for years to come,"
predicted Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   And Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, charged that
the Senate was "handing our nation's energy security over to the auto
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Ron DeFore of the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, another SUV
supporter, argues that safety often gets lost in the fuel economy
debate.</TE>
<TE>   Public safety will suffer, he said, if drivers must give up their
light trucks and sport utility vehicles to drive smaller vehicles.
Various studies conclude, he said, that our emphasis on driving small
cars over the last several decades has led to an increase of more
than 2,000 deaths in automobile accidents. The heavier the vehicle,
the more protection it provides occupants, said DeFore, spokesman for
the Washington-based group.</TE>
<TE>   But driving a sturdy SUV doesn't guarantee occupants' safety. In
1997 alone, nearly 1,500 people were killed in SUV rollovers. Besides
generally polluting at a higher rate, the high-riding vehicles block
other motorists' visibility, and some experts suggest that truck and
SUV drivers take more risks behind the wheel because they feel more
protected in a larger vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   A new report on auto safety prepared for the American Council for
an Energy-Efficient Economy found that the average SUV or pickup
truck is more dangerous than most cars on the road when the risk
posed to other drivers is taken into account. The study is based on
the private Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's annual driver
death rates report. It also shows that, contrary to conventional
wisdom, many small cars have lower fatality rates among their own
drivers than do SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   But back on the issue of the environment, scientists say that as
temperatures rise, ice shelves in Antarctica continue to collapse
with staggering speed. Years from now, the collapse of these shelves
could lead to a rapid rise of the sea level.</TE>
<TE>   I must admit I'm more worried about the consequences of global
warming and melting icebergs than whether or not the neighborhood
soccer mom, or anyone else, has a big enough minivan or sport
utility.</TE>

<HD>Paying Court to a Genre</HD>
<DH>Movies* Director Carl Franklin puts his own spin on the
legal-drama tradition with 'High Crimes,' about a top-secret
proceeding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLEN BASKIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"This is really the first genre film I've done, and that's why I
wanted to do it," director Carl Franklin explains about his new legal
thriller "High Crimes," which opens Friday. "I wanted to exercise a
little bit in the pop culture vernacular, which I hadn't had a chance
to do."</LD>
<LD>   The courtroom drama has been a studio staple since sound came to
Hollywood, and it's as popular today as ever, if not more
so--Paramount in particular has churned out a seemingly endless
series of the thrillers.</LD>
<LD>   "High Crimes'" two stars, Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman, are two
of the genre's biggest attractions, in such films as "Double
Jeopardy" (Judd), "Along Came a Spider" (Freeman) and "Kiss the
Girls" (both). For Franklin, though, "High Crimes"--which is,
surprisingly, not a Paramount but a 20th Century Fox film--represents
a distinct change of pace.</LD>
<TE>   The film industry first took notice of Franklin after "One False
Move" (1991), a low-budget, highly charged racial drama starring (and
co-written by) Billy Bob Thornton. He has made just two features
since then, the atmospheric 1940s-era mystery "Devil in a Blue Dress"
(1995) and 1998's "One True Thing," a family drama about the lasting
value of close personal ties that Franklin considers his most
important work to date.</TE>
<TE>   "One False Move" could be considered a thriller, but it certainly
lacks the glossy, high-concept elements of more clearly defined genre
pieces--like "High Crimes," whose budget is in the mid-$40-million
range. With "High Crimes," Franklin hopes, "it's the players and the
characters that make it fresh. Most of the time, when you're dealing
with a genre thriller, the characters are just functional."</TE>
<TE>   But Franklin admits, "I don't know that you actually can change
the rules of the genre, to reinvent it in such a way that people
don't have any anticipations about what's going to happen. If you go
out and make the same movie that someone else has made or you follow
any particular template too closely, I don't think you really have a
reason to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Putting His Stamp</TE>
<TE>   on the Material</TE>
<TE>   The director says he took a more subjective approach to the
characters than is usual for the genre, as a way of getting audiences
more involved with their stories. "Often the time isn't taken to
allow any exchange of emotion between the characters."</TE>
<TE>   For Franklin, putting his own stamp on the material was crucial.
He notes, "I like to try to break some ground with whatever I'm
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Court was in session in Hollywood on an overcast afternoon last
spring, as pivotal trial scenes were being shot for "High Crimes."
While the cameras were rolling, tense legal maneuvering was the order
of the day, as a top-secret military court made its ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Between takes, things were more relaxed. Judd, clad in a cranberry
suit jacket and gray sweatpants (only close-ups were being shot at
the moment) read the newspaper. Freeman put his feet up to catch a
quick catnap, swearing he really was able to nod off, no matter the
surrounding hustle and bustle. Co-star Jim Caviezel, in military full
dress, spent a few minutes with his real-life wife and other family
members visiting the set.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate area of the sound stage, Franklin didn't get to take
a break. He was looking carefully at video playback of the scene just
shot and conferring with the camera crew about the next setup. Five
days in all would be spent on this soundstage, followed by several
weeks in Mexico, where Franklin shot flashback sequences that
explained the long-ago action at the core of the story's intrigue.</TE>
<TE>   Covert Operation</TE>
<TE>   Figures in Plot</TE>
<TE>   Claire Kubik (Judd) is a high-powered Bay Area attorney whose
idyllic life is abruptly shattered when her husband Tom (Caviezel) is
arrested. He's charged by the FBI with murdering civilians in El
Salvador during a covert military operation more than a decade
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Claire had no idea Tom ever served in the armed forces; what's
more, she didn't know that Tom Kubik isn't his real name. Convinced,
nevertheless, of her husband's innocence, Claire, a seasoned
litigator, decides to represent him.</TE>
<TE>   But she quickly realizes she's on unfamiliar turf. Everything is
classified, much important information withheld from her. The
military has legal rules all its own, so Claire enlists the aid of
ex-military attorney Charlie Grimes (Freeman), a self-defined "wild
card" who, she quickly learns, plays by his own set of iconoclastic
rules.</TE>
<TE>   "High Crimes" reunites stars Judd and Freeman, who appeared
together in 1997's "Kiss the Girls," an unexpectedly successful
odd-couple pairing that brought in $60 million at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got a great rapport," notes Franklin of the duo. "Somehow
they're the 2002 version of Nick and Nora [Charles]"--the
husband-and-wife team in the legendary "Thin Man" movies of the 1930s
and '40s.</TE>
<TE>   Judd has her own view on the unconventional pairing. "We sort of
fancy ourselves the new Hepburn and Tracy," she says. "Anytime I read
anything, I think of Morgan," Judd says. "His work is like a magical
creation, even though you know it didn't come from nowhere. I think
he's a little bit like couture, where you can't see the seams."</TE>
<TE>   Notes Freeman: "We feel like we've got a certain kind of chemistry
together."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Judd had to be convinced to appear in another
woman-in-jeopardy role. "Carl talked me into it," she declares. At
the time, "I was doing back-to-back junkets for 'Double Jeopardy' and
'Eye of the Beholder,' and I had the flu, so the idea of going back
to work was not very appealing. But he burned up the telephone lines.</TE>
<TE>   "He chatted me up about it so convincingly that I was sold. And I
thought a bit about Claire and getting to play someone who is
straightforward and strong, who really lives by the brain but also
simultaneously is caught up in this tremendous emotional vortex."</TE>
<TE>   When filming began, Judd recalls, "I asked Carl to push me. I'd
just finished [the romantic comedy] 'Someone Like You,' which was
very different for me, and I didn't want to come back to a genre that
I've already established in my repertoire and coast. So I asked him
to push me, and he promised he would."</TE>
<TE>   The feeling on the set is unusually relaxed, according to the
crew, many of whom have worked with Franklin on earlier projects.
Producer Jesse B'Franklin has been the director's professional and
personal partner for more than a decade; the two were married in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Yang, who for seven years was president of high-octane
filmmaker Oliver Stone's production company and is another of "High
Crimes'" producers (she was first attached to the project five years
ago, with then-partner Lisa Henson), comments that "I never knew a
director could be so genteel and lovely to everybody. Carl is
extraordinarily decent at all times."</TE>
<TE>   Adapting a Book</TE>
<TE>   for the Screen</TE>
<TE>   The "High Crimes" screenplay was written by the husband-and-wife
team of Yuri Zeltser and Cary Bickley and is based on the novel by
Joseph Finder.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, significant changes were made when adapting the novel
into a film. Finder wasn't distressed at the alterations to his
story; in fact, he flew in from Boston to appear in the film.
Franklin, 52, is characteristically thoughtful about the challenges
of adapting a book for the screen. "Conflicts in books often focus on
conflicts within a character as opposed to between characters," he
says. "It's hard to show a conflict on the screen when it's all
inside of one person. I look for a way to divide it up and spread it
around a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   The goings-on in "High Crimes" were moved from the novel's East
Coast setting to California, with many of the military scenes shot at
a Bay Area naval facility. The courtroom sequences represented the
first time Franklin has ever shot on a sound stage (other sets were
also built to serve as a brig and interrogation room).</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to shoot on stages, certainly not for the majority
of the film, because I think the air doesn't move," he observes. When
actors have to walk through real doors and up real staircases, he
notes, "they encounter the natural obstacles, which gives [the
action] more of an edge. Life is ragged, and when you're in a real
location, those idiosyncratic things that happen in life can happen
on film."</TE>
<TE>   As he awaits the critical and audience verdict on "High Crimes,"
Franklin is working on pre-production for his next project, "Out of
Time," which will reunite him with "Devil in a Blue Dress" star
Denzel Washington. Filming begins soon in Florida on the drama that
finds Washington cast as a police chief (a good-guy cop this time,
unlike his best actor rogue-cop role in "Training Day").</TE>
<TE>   Once again, Franklin will endeavor to put his unique spin on the
material at hand, however straightforward the initial story might
appear.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be some original impetus, I believe, for any piece
of art," the filmmaker believes.</TE>
<TE>   "And even though it's Hollywood and all that stuff, I still call
it art."</TE>

<HD>PBS Traces Evolution of Global Economy</HD>
<DH>'Commanding Heights,' an engaging six-hour documentary,
looks at World War I, the Eastern bloc and an era of reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some concepts are bound to arouse the skeptic in almost anyone.
Painless dentistry. Easy assembly. Vanilla Coke.</LD>
<LD>   How about the idea of an engaging three-part, six-hour documentary
on the evolution of the global economy? PBS has crafted just that
with "Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy," a
surprisingly brisk tale that speaks plainly to the intellectually
curious--not just the economy wonks.</LD>
<LD>   Based on the book by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw,
"Commanding Heights" starts tonight with "The Battle of Ideas" that
arose from the ashes of World War I. It was a struggle over who would
control the railroads, steel mills and other "commanding heights" of
the economy, as Lenin called them.</LD>
<TE>   The program continues in the same slot over the next two weeks,
exploring "The Agony of Reform" in the Eastern bloc and elsewhere
before concluding with a look at "The New Rules of the Game" in
today's promising but perilous era of globalization.</TE>
<TE>   Blending archival footage and frank interviews with world leaders,
scholars and everyday folks, "Commanding Heights" captures the
eternal reach and fluid rhythms of economic force.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's segment shows how the world moved for decades toward
more government control before swaying the other way. At the center
of the battle lay the ideas of two economists: John Maynard Keynes,
the Englishman who advocated intervention to control booms and busts,
and Friedrich von Hayek, the Austrian emigre who argued that big
government stifled innovation.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, economic crises prompted Western politicians to
rediscover Hayek. In the '80s, the simultaneous rise of President
Ronald Reagan and Britain's Margaret Thatcher set the stage for a
worldwide capitalist revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Next week's segment shows how the fall of the Berlin Wall heralded
an era of reform around the world--in Russia and the Eastern bloc; in
democracies like India, where a red-tape "permit raj" had replaced
Britain's Raj after independence; and in Latin America, which had
developed its own brand of bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   New liberties brought new problems: In a leaner Poland, reform
hurt workers whose struggle led to freedom, while in Russia, gangster
capitalism ruled "the Wild East" with a heavy hand of its own.</TE>
<TE>   The third segment shows how the global economy has been
transformed by online financial markets, transnational mergers and
currency speculation that dwarfs trade in goods and services.</TE>
<TE>   With the story of a Thai entrepreneur who built a luxury condo
complex in 1997, only to see it repossessed as the Asian currency
crisis fueled by international hedge fund managers turned his
customers into paupers, "Commanding Heights" puts a human face on the
buzzword of globalization.</TE>
<TE>   Now the man walks the streets of Bangkok selling sushi from a
cart, dreaming of becoming "the McDonald's of Thailand," determined
to control his fate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Commanding Heights" premieres tonight at 9 on KCET-TV. Episodes 2
and 3 air April 10 and 17 at the same time.</TE>

<HD>Landmark Album Comes Full Circle</HD>
<DH>Music* The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's melding of pop and
country is reissued in the 'O Brother' era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine, if you will, an album conceived by a Los Angeles-based
producer pairing contemporary musicians with a slew of bluegrass and
country music legends singing songs mostly from the early 20th
century--and it turns into a surprise hit on the pop charts?</LD>
<LD>   Oh, brother....</LD>
<LD>   Actually, almost three decades before producer T Bone Burnett put
the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack together, another album
did much the same thing: the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's "Will the
Circle Be Unbroken," which is being reissued this week to mark the
album's 30th anniversary.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought it was real nice of them to plan all that success to
coincide with us putting 'Circle' out again," jokes John McEuen, the
Dirt Band's banjo player and fiddler, who reunited with the group
last year after a decade pursuing solo projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The main parallel I would draw," he adds, "is that both albums
showed there's a huge audience for this kind of music, if people know
where to find it."</TE>
<TE>   Just as "O Brother" has led a new audience to the wellspring of
American mountain music, folk and blues, and to performers who rarely
show up on the pop charts, the "Circle" album pointed countless rock
and pop fans toward vintage country, bluegrass and folk music when it
came out in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California-bred country-rock group teamed on the
three-LP set with the likes of banjo virtuoso Earl Scruggs, country
music matriarch Mother Maybelle Carter, Grand Ole Opry patriarch Roy
Acuff, guitar whizzes Doc Watson and Merle Travis and others on such
songs as the Carter Family's "Wildwood Flower," Acuff's "The Precious
Jewel" and Dorothy Dixon's "Wreck on the Highway."</TE>
<TE>   The performers also can be heard chatting between songs, figuring
out arrangements, making instrumental choices or just getting to know
one another, as in a conversation between Watson and Travis, who had
long admired each other's work but had never met until they were
invited to play with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.</TE>
<TE>   It was a risky move at a time when there was little intersection
between pop and country circles. Additionally, the country music
establishment had largely turned its back on the veterans the Dirt
Band most admired: One Nashville publication at the time labeled the
"Circle" participants "dinosaurs" because their music seemed
light-years removed from the smooth pop-sounding "countrypolitan"
records coming out of Music City at the time.</TE>
<TE>   But it built a bridge between the pop and traditional country
worlds that continues to be walked today. "To my mind, the 'Circle'
album opened the doors to the collaborations we've seen, like Travis
Tritt recording with the Eagles, or Rob Thomas co-writing songs for
Willie Nelson's latest album," says Deborah Evans Price, associate
editor of country and Christian music for Billboard. "That happens
frequently now and nobody bats an eye, but there wasn't hardly any of
that going on back then. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band kind of blazed
that path."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, country radio today has ignored the kind of raw, rural
music championed on "O Brother" in favor of slicker pop-country fare
that had dominated country radio for at least a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Since "O Brother" won the Grammy for album of the year in
February, however, country stations have begun playing music from it
with greater success.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very timely, because the Grammys were on a Wednesday
night, and the country radio industry was in Nashville convening that
week for the annual Country Radio Seminar," says R.J. Curtis, program
director for Los Angeles country station KZLA-FM (93.9). "O
Brother's" Grammy win "was the hot topic there, and the following
Monday, 'A Man of Constant Sorrow' was one of the most added
recordings across the nation, KZLA included."</TE>
<TE>   Curtis says that when the station played the same song last year,
listeners recognized it but didn't like it.</TE>
<TE>   In playing the same song since the Grammys, Curtis says KZLA
listeners give it an even higher familiarity rating in the station's
call-out research, but now the approval rating has shot up as well.</TE>
<TE>   "When the direction to [roots music] is an easy path, people will
like it," says McEuen, "and what's great about that movie is it
helped open more eyes to see where to find it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, most country observers agree that it will be months, years
even, before the verdict is in on whether the "O Brother" phenomenon
represents an intriguing aberration or a genuine revolution. In 1972,
the Dirt Band also was flying blind.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of risked our whole career to record with the people who
were our influences," McEuen says. "If that album had stiffed, or we
got into the studio and nothing worked, it would have been really
embarrassing. But it happened so quick that the power of the music
took over."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, instead of selling a few thousand copies to hard-core
country and bluegrass fans, "Will the Circle Be Unbroken" went on to
sell more than 1 million copies, helping open the eyes and ears of
pop fans to sounds that contributed to the birth of rock 'n' roll
while opening doors in country music to new musical possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The "Circle" reissue is a two-CD package that revives the original
artwork, features sound remastered from the original tapes and adds a
couple of rediscovered songs and more dialogue from the marathon
sessions recorded over six days in August 1971.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just a bunch of kids, all in our early 20s," recalls Dirt
Band singer-songwriter-guitarist Jeff Hanna. "The whole experience of
recording it was so quick--it took less than a week to make--that it
seemed at the time like kind of an exciting blur. But as time has
gone on, the scope of the project has taken on a much bigger meaning.
It's become more important to a lot of people, because it spanned
generations and cultures."</TE>
<TE>   As was the case with "O Brother," success for "Circle" seemed
remote at best when it was being recorded. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band
was at its commercial peak, yet the biggest hit of its career, a 1970
version of Jerry Jeff Walker's "Mr. Bojangles" that reached No. 9 in
Billboard, hardly put the band in Midas-touch territory.</TE>
<TE>   The genesis of the "Circle" album was an encounter with Scruggs,
who brought his family to hear the Dirt Band perform in Nashville one
night because Scruggs' children were fans.</TE>
<TE>   Band members nervously asked him after the show if he'd ever
consider recording a song with them and were pleasantly surprised
when he consented. That led them a little while later to extend a
similar invitation to Doc Watson, using Scruggs' promise as their
calling card.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, Bill [McEuen, John's older brother who was the
Dirt Band's producer] pulled us aside and said, 'I have this concept:
Let's do a record where you guys play with all of your heroes, all
these icons.'"</TE>
<TE>   The band's longtime members--Hanna, McEuen, Jimmy Ibbotson, Jimmie
Fadden--had developed an affinity for roots music despite growing up
in Long Beach and Orange County in the 1960s, when most of their
peers were more interested in hearing the latest hits by the Beatles,
the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys than decades-old music of the
Carter Family and Bill Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   Like many pop and rock aficionados, they pored over the credits of
then-popular folk albums by Bob Dylan, the Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul
&amp; Mary and others to find out where the songs they were singing
originated. That led them, Hanna says, to the source: folk, blues and
country artists including Flatt &amp; Scruggs, the Carter Family,
Mississippi John Hurt, Sonny Terry &amp; Brownie McGhee and Doc Watson.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even though musicians ranging from Dylan and the Byrds to
Linda Ronstadt and Rick Nelson had been experimenting with melding
country and rock since the mid-'60s, Nashville still cast a wary
glance on rock in the early '70s, which made the Dirt Band's proposal
all the more daring.</TE>
<TE>   "That cliche about the hippies and the rednecks getting together,
that had some weight," Hanna says. "The music was the real common
ground, and I think that's what broke down any apprehension there had
been."</TE>
<TE>   Over time, Hanna adds, he values the feeling of community that
developed more than any particular performance or anecdote that came
out of the original "Circle" recording sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "All those memories have become more special to us because we've
lost so many of these folks since then," he says. "I keep saying
this, but it's true: I felt as if we were being welcomed into a
family. It started with Earl Scruggs and his family, but it extended
to that entire family of musicians we met on those sessions."</TE>
<TE>   The Dirt Band members see the success of "O Brother" as proof anew
of the timeless power of the seminal music they set out to celebrate
30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "With some music you hear on the radio, sometimes you can't
envision real people playing it," says McEuen. "There's something
about acoustic music--not just bluegrass--but all acoustic music that
makes you feel that it's made by real people. One thing I think the
'Circle' album does, it makes you feel that you're getting to know
the people who are playing, and that they are telling you a story
with music, and that it's a story that they believe in."</TE>

<HD>Five From Czech 'New Wave'</HD>
<DH>Video* A brief breath of freedom in the late '60s produced
some rich and remarkable films. A Chicago firm is now releasing a
series of them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONALD LIEBENSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When film buffs talk "New Wave," they are most likely referring to
the French film critics-turned-directors who invigorated world cinema
in the early 1960s, or Germany's cinematic renaissance in the 1970s.
But a revelatory new video collection unearths remarkable films from
1960s Czechoslovakia, where a new generation of precocious directors
blossomed during the fleeting Prague Spring.</LD>
<LD>   "Daisies," "The Joke," "Adelheid," "Lemonade Joe" and "The
Capricious Summer" are the first five releases in Chicago-based Facet
Video's "Czech New Wave" collection just released on videocassette.
("Daisies" and "The Joke" are also available on DVD.) They represent
a cross-section of the stylistically diverse films of this rich and
prolific period.</LD>
<LD>   "Some people called this the Czech film miracle," notes Facets
co-founder Milos Stehlik, "because it just came out of nowhere so
quickly after this era of harsh communism. Because it came to an end
with the Russian invasion in 1968, most people have not had a chance
to see how many wonderful films were made."</LD>
<TE>   Some directors did achieve international success. Jan Kadar's "The
Shop on Main Street" and Jiri Menzel's "Closely Watched Trains" won
Academy Awards for best foreign-language film, and "Love of a Blonde"
put Milos Forman on the map.</TE>
<TE>   But, Stehlik said, "there is so much more to discover. The range
and breadth and degree of talent that existed there is really
astronomical."</TE>
<TE>   These fledgling directors emerged from film school in the early
1960s just as there was a relaxation in the hard-line censorship and
control of the film industry. They were inspired, Stehlik said, "by
new ideas. They had grown up on American films and films of the
French New Wave. These were the forces that inspired them. And they
were able to push the envelope."</TE>
<TE>   Vera Chytilova's "Daisies" (1966) didn't push the envelope. It
shredded it like an Enron document. "Nobody understands us," moan the
two Maries, two madcap women who know that the world is going bad.
"We're going bad as well," they cheerfully resolve. This amounts to
freeloading meals, being ejected from a nightclub and laying waste to
a banquet. Mere synopsis does not do justice to the free-associative
surreal dreamscape that anticipates David Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   This legendary anarchic comedy was denounced by no fewer than 21
government authorities, who protested that it represented "a road of
our cultural life on which no honest worker, farmer or intellectual
would like to embark." (You can read this document for yourself on
the DVD.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's a testing of limits," Stehlik observes, "a testing of rules
and conventions. These two girls are testing freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Another rediscovered treasure of the Czech New Wave is "The Joke"
(1968), Jaromil Jares' devastating film based on Milan Kundera's
novel.</TE>
<TE>   Josef Somr stars as a man whose hedonistic life is upended after
he sends an irreverent postcard--"Optimism is the opium of the
people"--to a woman he is trying to seduce. A Stalinist true
believer, she turns the postcard in to the authorities, who expel the
man from the Communist party and sentence him to hard labor. After 15
years, he returns to his village to exact his revenge.</TE>
<TE>   This courageous indictment of totalitarianism has lost little of
its wounding impact, as conveyed by the innovative use of subjective
flashbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Adelheid" (1969) is another haunting film. Directed by Frantisek
Vlacil, whom Stehlik praised as "the unknown hero of Czech cinema,"
it is a love story set in the immediate aftermath of World War II. A
former soldier returns home to take charge of a manor formerly owned
by a German family. He falls in love with the daughter, who now
serves as a maid.</TE>
<TE>   Vlacil is little known outside the Czech Republic. A retrospective
of his films will be shown in Los Angeles at the American
Cinematheque later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The most accessible film of Facets' collection is Oldrich Lipsky's
"Lemonade Joe" (1964), arguably the most offbeat western since
"Terror of Tiny Town."</TE>
<TE>   This affectionate musical spoof owes as much to silent comedy as
it does to the classic Hollywood horse opera. Welcome to the
Trigger-Whiskey Saloon, where brutes menace the beautiful local
temperance crusader, and singer Tornado Lou holds court. Enter
Lemonade Joe, "defender of the law, avenger of wrongs," and purveyor
of the magic elixir Kolaloka. Making the case for whiskey is
black-clad gunslinger Hogofogo, outlaw and long-lost brother to
saloon owner Duke Badman.</TE>
<TE>   "Capricious Summer" (1967), Menzel's follow-up to "Closely Watched
Trains," is a gentle, pastoral comedy in the Jean Renoir tradition.
Three middle-aged friends while away the hours in a sleepy resort.
Menzel himself appears as a magician, whose beautiful assistant
shatters their idyllic respite.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 40 years later, these films "ring fresh and true," Stehlik
says. "The filmmakers were excited about making these films. It was a
way of discovering themselves and presenting to the world their
hopes, aspirations and their sense of humor after a long period of
repression. That's one reason they have not dated."</TE>
<TE>   Another is that they are not widely known. Several were exhibited
only briefly before the Soviet invasion, after which the films were
pulled, to languish in the vaults.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the odd Czech film, such as Jan Hrebejk's "Divided We Fall"
and Jan Sverak's "Kolya," receives commercial distribution in the
West. But lack of financial support hamstrings a new generation of
talented filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Each title in the "Czech New Wave" collection retails for $30.

<LD>The official-looking document that turned up in my mail would have
seemed like an April Fools' prank were it not for the ABC Cable
Networks Group/Disney Channel letterhead.</LD>
<LD>   "Nudity in zone 1 is not allowed," it read at one point. "Nudity
in zone 2 is not allowed. Nudity in a nonsexual context such as a
baby's bottom in 'Three Men and a Baby' or the research scientist's
rear end in 'Never Cry Wolf' may be acceptable in zones 3 and 4. Full
frontal nudity is never allowed."</LD>
<LD>   I spent a long time looking at this--trying to figure out where my
zone 1 is, and thinking that my zone 2 has probably seen better
days--before realizing "zone" actually referred to specific times of
day and determining that the several pages detailing the Disney
Channel's programming standards were legitimate. Indeed, based on
this season's new sitcoms, it's clear only a TV executive who isn't
trying could be this funny.</LD>
<TE>   Critics and watchdog groups assume that television networks will
put on anything so long as they think it will attract an audience,
with little regard to the damage done to impressionable youngsters
and society at large.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while it's undeniable that the major networks' programming
standards have relaxed over the years, the parameters set forth by
the Disney Channel (and repeated to varying degrees elsewhere)
indicate a good deal of thought goes into deciding what is
appropriate. In fact, people with serious-sounding titles and
backgrounds in education or the social sciences spent hours drafting
this material, which could have easily been lifted directly from a
George Carlin comedy routine.</TE>
<TE>   The Disney guidelines include everyone's favorite media excesses,
sex and violence. For instance, it's pointed out that a movie in
which the character is "driven by his need to 'score' or 'nail' a
certain girl" would be problematic, thus eliminating most Hollywood
summer comedies from the channel's programming. Still, other areas of
concern may not be quite so obvious. It's worth knowing, for example,
that "actual hypnosis techniques may not be demonstrated in detail."
Under the heading "Safety," producers are told: "Seat-belts should
always be worn inside a moving vehicle" and "programs should not
instruct a child on how to strike a match." Instructing children in
the art of begging for Mickey Mouse plush toys, or hypnotizing them
with repeated exposure to Buzz Lightyear, is doubtless another matter
entirely.</TE>
<TE>   As for language, the channel not only lists types of expressions
that might be unacceptable but also proceeds to rattle off 19
specific words or terms that can't be repeated here to demonstrate
the point, plus a few more that are OK in one context (as Carlin put
it, think of something Mary might have ridden into Bethlehem) but not
another.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Ross, the Disney Channel's president of entertainment, said
the guidelines are reevaluated every six months and provide a
template to "help us stay consistent with our brand vision"--a fancy
way of saying that the channel wants to remain relevant without
alienating those seeking wholesome entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "The Disney of 2002 is not the Disney of 1952," he said. "We
review our standards constantly, because the social mores change over
time and evolve over time." The company recognizes its
responsibility, he added, "to fulfill our social contract with the
audience."</TE>
<TE>   That's where the standards and practices department comes in. It's
up to them to ensure that producers are aware, among other things,
that "Girls should not be relegated to passive roles like always
playing with dolls while boys are constructing a dam."</TE>
<TE>   Or this, explaining why Quentin Tarantino films, or "The Dean
Martin Roasts," don't turn up on the Disney Channel: "The use of
alcohol, drugs and cigarettes must not be glamorized, and revealing
the adverse consequences of abuse is appreciated (e.g., hacking
cough, the dangers of driving while intoxicated, hangover, etc.)."</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, the standards highlight the wrestling match
networks face in seeking to bring order to TV's chaos, just as
academics and interest groups seek to help define what spills out of
the screen by measuring it, labeling it and making the whole
subjective mess sound thoroughly scientific.</TE>
<TE>   So we get studies like the one the Center for Media and Public
Affairs recently issued, which found the volume of sex and violence
in prime time has declined compared with a few years ago. Last week,
meanwhile, a 17-year study was released citing a correlation between
children's TV viewing and aggressive behavior later in life.</TE>
<TE>   Memo to the latter researchers: My brother and I should be locked
up immediately. We watched "The Magnificent Seven" nine times in a
week once during the "Million-Dollar Movie" days. Granted, neither of
us is especially violent, but we can quote all of Yul Brynner's
dialogue from the film, which is suspicious enough.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to the former survey, one could argue that sexual and
violent content has diminished in part because prime-time sitcoms and
dramas full of one or the other were supplanted by so-called
"reality" shows--including concepts that risk drowning contestants
(as nearly happened on an NBC project taping last week), encourage
guests to betray one another or challenge them to eat bugs. Let's
have the kids watch that for 17 years and see how they turn out.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout this debate, there tends to be more flash than sober
analysis, more outrage than enlightenment. A case in point: On
Thursday, Fox broadcast a special about the media's corrupting
influence on children, hosted by Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly, in
the same slot in which the network previously ran the sex-obsessed
"Temptation Island 2." At Fox, O'Reilly's self-proclaimed "no-spin
zone" apparently leaves ample room for hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   The simple truth, of course, is that television displays plenty of
programming a vigilant parent wouldn't want young children to watch,
while creating havens such as Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel (for
those with cable or satellite dishes, anyway) that endeavor to be
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, whatever people may tell pollsters, the evidence
suggests they are reasonably satisfied with TV (they certainly watch
enough of it, with Nielsen Media Research estimating the average U.S.
household has a set on more than 7 hours a day), while the truly
discontented never will be.</TE>
<TE>   As for making any wider sense of this tube of babble beyond that,
well, just trying is enough to give you a pain in zone 2.</TE>

<LD>   Public TV Stations Unite for Newsmagazine</LD>
<LD>   Tackling an arena largely ignored by television, a coalition of
PBS stations in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and Sacramento
is launching "California Connected" on April 25.</LD>
<TE>   The hourlong weekly newsmagazine will examine events and issues
through the eyes of local policymakers, opinion-shapers and
grass-roots community leaders. Airing on public TV stations
statewide, it will be hosted by David Brancaccio, best known as the
host of Minnesota Public Radio's "Marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of each broadcast, there will be a "get connected"
minute informing people about what policy issues are being tackled
the next day and how they can get involved. An interactive Web site
is being developed to spark viewer dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "This state is one of the most diverse places in the
world--ethnically, economically and geographically," Brancaccio said.
"How do you forge a state identity? That is the challenge we're
tackling with the program."</TE>
<TE>   UPN Drops Reruns</TE>
<TE>   of 'Amazing Race 2'</TE>
<TE>   "Repurposing"--the season's hottest trend in the TV
business--sounds good on paper. But taking a show from one network
and putting it on another in the same corporate pack doesn't always
work.</TE>
<TE>   The latest example: CBS is canceling its weekly rerun of the
unscripted show "The Amazing Race 2" on its corporate cousin, UPN. It
was an experiment that seemed to aggravate more people than actually
tuned in.</TE>
<TE>   CBS affiliates were concerned that fans of the show would be less
compelled to watch on Wednesdays if they knew they had Friday as a
backup. And some UPN affiliates weren't happy because it made their
network seem like a minor-league farm team to CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Adding salt to the wound: "The Amazing Race 2" was the second
lowest-rated show on UPN last week, drawing fewer than 1.3 million
viewers. The program will be replaced by a movie as UPN also drops
another unscripted series--the two-week old "Under One Roof," which
preceded "Amazing Race 2" on Fridays. A network spokeswoman said
"Under One Roof" may return in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Leads the Cable News Pack in March</TE>
<TE>   Fox News Channel widened its lead as the top-rated cable news
channel in March--giving it bragging rights for the first quarter of
2002.</TE>
<TE>   For the month, Fox's third on top, the network drew an average
681,000 viewers per day while CNN was averaging 533,000. In prime
time, Fox averaged 1.2 million viewers to CNN's 939,000.</TE>
<TE>   For the first three months of the year, Fox averaged 666,000
viewers per day to 546,000 for CNN, 290,000 for MSNBC, 270,000 for
CNBC and 220,000 for CNN Headline News.</TE>
<TE>   Despite losing to Fox, CNN said the first-quarter ratings were its
highest three-month figures since Fox and MSNBC launched in 1996, a
result of heightened interest in the news.</TE>
<TE>   Distant-third MSNBC, meanwhile, is closing in on a new prime-time
lineup, which would include a 5 p.m. show anchored by former daytime
talk-show host Phil Donahue. Under the scenario being discussed,
Brian Williams' newscast would move to 4 p.m., and at 6 p.m. MSNBC
would air Chris Matthews' "Hardball." The latter show would become
exclusive to the channel and no longer be seen on CNBC.</TE>

<HD>Two Feet on the Ground</HD>
<DH>Rachel Griffiths is making her mark with distinctly
American roles, but the Australian actress has her heart set on an
eclectic career.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rachel Griffiths barrels around a sharp curve in the Hollywood Hills
and pulls up the driveway of her home, apologizing for being late.
There was more traffic than usual at the farmers market in Hollywood
on this Oscar Sunday, she explains. Helping unload the fruits and
veggies from her American-make SUV is a man she introduces as "my
husband."</LD>
<LD>   Like her character Brenda on the HBO series "Six Feet Under," the
Australian-born actress maintains her cool composure even as she
drops little bombshells, whether they're true or not. No, she isn't
actually married, but the man, Andrew by name, is definitely her
beau. Though they've only been seeing each other for a short time,
she says, "Andrew and I are well matched, intellectually and
creatively equal--he's a painter. The best part of each of us is as
an artist."</LD>
<LD>   Unlike many American actors, Griffiths doesn't bother to be
perpetually camera-ready. She's dressed down, no makeup, and the
house has a lived-in disorder. Her conversation is similarly
unadorned and uncensored. She wanders about from subject to subject,
refreshingly opinionated about a variety of subjects from baring her
breasts in public to the rowdiness of Russell Crowe.</LD>
<TE>   Her wide-ranging career started on the stage in her native
Melbourne, where she will return in May to star in the Pulitzer
Prize-winning drama "Proof."</TE>
<TE>   "I've always worked," says Griffiths, 33, though as with every
actor there have been disappointments along the way and, even with
her sudden popularity on "Six Feet Under," there are disappointments
still. "I can't get seen for some things I would love to do or it
goes to other girls. But I've learned to make disappointment my
friend because if you do, it allows different opportunities to arise.
I plan to have a long, rich career. I still want to be surprising
people when I'm in my 50s."</TE>
<TE>   Griffiths is off to a good start. Since coming to the attention of
international audiences as Toni Collette's freewheeling friend in the
1994 Australian comedy "Muriel's Wedding," Griffiths has turned in a
number of eclectic and surprising performances in mostly
art-house-type films, most prominently 1998's "Hilary and Jackie,"
which brought her an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.</TE>
<TE>   Griffiths stars in two new films that demonstrate how wide-flung
her choices (and talents) are: In the Disney baseball saga "The
Rookie," she plays Dennis Quaid's wife (and sports a spot-on Texas
accent); in "Very Annie Mary," a small Welsh musical comedy, she
plays the daughter of a self-centered father (Jonathan Pryce) who
discourages her character from pursuing her passion--singing. She is
pleased with how both films turned out, particularly the smaller
Welsh film, in which she plays a dowdy, repressed spinster. "I'm
madly proud of that. I play a character as far from Brenda as
anything I've ever done."</TE>
<TE>   As for "The Rookie," the true story of a high school coach who
makes it to the major leagues, Griffiths related to the story "about
real struggle and complex ethics, the kind of movie I grew up with,
like 'The Yearling' and 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' that really taught
you something about life."</TE>
<TE>   She bemoans the fact that such realistic coming-of-age fare aimed
at kids ("Rookie" is G-rated) has lately been relegated to the small
screen, while motion pictures are mostly about affluent middle-class
children. "They're all about accessibility to material goods and
comforts. 'The Rookie,' is about the cost of chasing a dream, and my
character realizes she has to let her son see his father try and
fail, rather than saying it's better to be comfortable and not reach
your spiritual aspirations."</TE>
<TE>   The quest for spirituality, she says, links "The Rookie" with the
more frank "Six Feet Under," about the loves and lives of a family of
undertakers.</TE>
<TE>   Now in its second season, the series introduced Griffiths into
American living rooms and recently won her a Golden Globe for her
performance as the wildly intelligent, deliciously libidinous and
emotionally tempest-tossed Brenda, the girlfriend of reforming
Lothario Nate Fisher, played by Peter Krause. She finds it curious,
she says, that for all the media coverage on the series, "no one much
talks about the fact that we deal with theological questions on a
weekly basis through the characters' spiritual yearnings. God is a
constant, which is amazing on a TV show."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Griffiths' personal assessment of her work on "Six Feet
Under" is not as flattering as that of mainstream television critics
who have singled her out for praise. Playing Brenda has been "very
different, for sure," she says--and that's not always a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   In a movie or a play, she explains, her characters' dramatic
trajectory is all worked out. A television series is by nature
open-ended, and that clashes with "my control-freak nature in art.
I'm not a control freak in other parts of my life, but because of my
range as an actress, I need to be in control of my art--otherwise I
can go off the rails and suddenly wake up in the wrong movie [or
series].</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of my work in the first season was wildly inconsistent,
which came from not being able to hold on tightly. Peter [Krause]
says doing the show is very much like life; you never know what's
coming. And I say, that's why I make art, so I can have all the
answers."</TE>
<TE>   Brenda is also about as complex a depiction of a modern woman as
television offers. In addition to being unabashedly sexy (at one
point in the interview Griffiths puts down her looks which makes one
wonder if she's ever watched her bedroom scenes on television),
Brenda is smart, with an IQ of near genius level. On top of it all,
she's in the throes of an emotional maelstrom, the product of quirky
parents and of being the caretaker of a psychotic brother.</TE>
<TE>   How can one woman be so smart and so untethered at the same time?
"Just look at any study of school valedictorians 20 years later," she
responds. "They're all messed up because they were isolated and
didn't have any friends. It's the mid-level kids who were popular
that are the leaders. I'm afraid consciousness and intelligence do
little to help you through life practically."</TE>
<TE>   Because "Six Feet Under" requires her to be away from Melbourne
for seven months of the year, her homesickness becomes so acute that
she hops on a plane every time there's a week's hiatus. "From the
ages of 4 to 27, I lived within two miles of where I was born," she
explains. "The same parish, the same parish church, two Catholic
schools. I miss the texture of Australia; I miss the light."</TE>
<TE>   Lest anyone confuse her for a Australian Tourist Commission
spokesperson, this is the same Rachel Griffiths who showed up topless
to protest the opening of a casino in her hometown, realizing that
bare breasts are a guaranteed attention-getter. It was her "Marge
Simpson moment," she says, "a voice of dissent in my community about
my community."</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to her obstreperous countryman Russell Crowe, who
recently made headlines for taking violent exception when his
acceptance speech at this year's British Academy of Film and
Television Arts Awards was cut short by the show's producer.</TE>
<TE>   "Russ couldn't act gravity and moral outrage if he wasn't
outraged," Griffiths says. "That's the nature of his voice, and in
Australia we love him for his passion and his heart. In his movies,
he always makes you feel something."</TE>
<TE>   Though we share a common language and an Anglo heritage, Griffiths
notes that there are crucial differences between Aussies and
Americans. "Here [in the U.S.] it's about how you're seen. In
Australia it's about how you feel. Here it's more important to appear
to be nice than to have heart. Being polite and nice is so important,
especially in this industry. I suppose if you appear bland, it's
easier for them to sell you as a product."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pacific Symphony will focus on contemporary composers in the
"Year of the American Composers Festival," in its 2002-03 classical
music season. The festival--which will be highlighted by a
competition for new American music--will showcase the music of
Pulitzer winner William Bolcom.</LD>
<LD>   Carl St.Clair will conduct the first West Coast performances of
Bolcom's "Songs of Innocence and of Experience"--settings of poems by
William Blake that require more than 250 performers--on Feb. 5-6.
Bolcom will be in residence at several Orange County universities and
colleges.</LD>
<LD>   Details about the residencies, the competition (which will involve
the American Composers Forum based in St. Paul, Minn.) and other
festival events will be announced. Guest artists for the season will
include violinist Sarah Chang and pianists Andre Watts, Stanislav
Ioudenitch, Christopher O'Riley, Arnaldo Cohen, Jonathan Biss and
Martin Kasik. Guest conductors will include Angel Gil-Ordonez and
Jean-Jacques Kantorow.</LD>
<TE>   The orchestra will continue its chamber music series, with three
concerts in Founders Hall at the Performing Arts Center and two at
the Irvine Barclay Theatre. It will again offer its 3 p.m. "Classical
Connections" concerts, each lasting about 90 minutes, at the center.</TE>
<TE>   There will be two non-subscription programs: Handel's "Messiah" on
Dec. 14 at the center and Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" on Jan. 28 at
the Barclay.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the Santa Ana-based orchestra will begin a series of
adult-education projects, consisting of pre- and post-concert
discussions, rehearsal attendances and a new three-part "Thoroughly
Modern Music" series exploring contemporary music.</TE>

<DH>In the mood for sketch comedy? Here's a look at current
offerings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A comedy sketch usually lasts no more than five minutes, but comedy
sketch groups can go on for decades. If it's a weekend and you're in
L.A., you can usually count on finding a few laughs at the
Groundlings, Acme Comedy Theatre and L.A. Connection.</LD>
<LD>   After visiting the current first-string sketch show at each of
these, it's time to compare and contrast.</LD>
<LD>   First and still foremost: the Groundlings. This pioneering company
stands out in several ways. It presents three performances of its
first-string show each weekend (the others present just one),
offering more chances for the cast to polish its work and for the
audience to see it. It features more female and nonwhite faces.
Although most of a Groundlings show is scripted, a few improvs add
dashes of a different kind of energy.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, a Groundlings show usually ends with a sensational
musical improv, often involving personal information gathered from a
guinea pig plucked out of the audience. You leave the show in awe of
the group's agility.</TE>
<TE>   All of the above applies to "Groundlings on Tap," the troupe's
current offering. Irrepressible Jeremy Rowley splits sides as a
security guard who's being interrogated by a cop after an altercation
that may have involved Magic Johnson. Waif-like Rachel Duguay is
hilarious as a sixth-grader doing a dance interpretation of the
Declaration of Independence.</TE>
<TE>   "Groundlings on Tap" features three sketches about social
encounters between two couples, which sounds monotonous on paper. But
the main joke of each sketch is sufficiently varied (an absurdly
bitter couple, a woman who goes completely blank whenever the men
leave the room, an unbearably cutesy couple) that each gets its
laughs.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of sketches aren't in the same league: one about a sexual
encounter on a night shift in which the woman's motivations aren't
clear enough, and another about a hillbilly town council meeting that
relies primarily on visual stereotypes. But on the night I saw
"Groundlings on Tap," all was redeemed by the final improv, in which
a boy band sang about an Orange County woman in the audience and even
managed to get in a rhyming comment about that county's 1994
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Acme Comedy Theatre, a few blocks away from the Groundlings, uses
the same format minus the improvs. The cast of the Acme Players' show
"Acme Doodle Dandy" has eight men and only two women, but the writing
and performing are almost as sharp as at the Groundlings.</TE>
<TE>   Jonna Tameses' Frat Pink gets "Doodle Dandy" off to a rousing
start. She plays a frat man who has gone through a sex change over
summer vacation. Billy Wright is the manic equivalent of the
Groundlings' Rowley, and his first sketch is a satire not only of
mime--an overdone target--but also the dim audiences that don't quite
understand mime. Bill Kessler and Robert Yasumura portray a car
salesman and a customer whose bargaining positions move farther and
farther apart--to ridiculous extremes.</TE>
<TE>   At L.A. Connection, "Generation Sketch" is hobbled by poor pacing:
25 sketches with no intermission, and only a sound operator--no live
band--to keep the energy up between sketches. The next to the last
sketch ("Gina"), which should be one of the best, is the weakest. The
group also could use a set designer to brighten the theater's dark,
scratched-up surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   The performances are better than the writing at L.A. Connection,
but there are signs of life in the sketches by Peter Fluet and Hal
Rudnick, especially in Rudnick's "Hallmark Moment" just before the
above-mentioned "Gina." The low point of the evening is a retro
sketch in a lesbian bar, with a bearded man playing a woman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Groundlings on Tap," 7307 Melrose Ave., L.A. Fridays, 8 p.m.;
Saturdays, 8 and 10 p.m. $18.50. (323) 934-9700. Running time: 1

<LD>It's been nearly seven months since the Sept. 11 attacks ripped the
complacency out of the American mind-set, and tonight comes yet
another TV show that appears to be out to milk the residual
skittishness for all it's worth.</LD>
<LD>   And it's a good thing it does. Although yes, the 9/11 news hook is
a bit contrived, the information presented in "The Court TV/Ladies
Home Journal Safety Challenge: The New Meaning of Safe" (10 p.m.) is
often an eye-opener. And just maybe a life-saver.</LD>
<LD>   The hourlong program, hosted by ABC News' Cynthia McFadden, uses a
multiple-choice quiz format to test viewers' knowledge of how to stay
out of harm's way in various situations.</LD>
<TE>   A couple of the segments--dealing with an unruly passenger on an
airplane, how to evacuate a burning high-rise--do stem from Sept. 11.
But the cases actually profiled via interviews and filmed
re-creations are several years old, and the advice offered is really
nothing that wouldn't have applied a decade or more ago.</TE>
<TE>   Yet tonight's show, the second installment of the "Safety
Challenge" series, keeps the 9/11 references coming. It also has
current or former New York City police and firefighters as guest
experts to further rev up the relevancy.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the other segments--which cover tips on securing your home
computer, checking into a hotel and surviving a house fire--are not
as topical but just as valuable. The "Gee, I didn't know that"
quotient is pretty high, and there is also a Web site tie-in (www
.courttv.com) for additional information. The May issue of Ladies
Home Journal offers articles that complete the packaging.</TE>
<TE>   So what hotel floor is the safest? And why is staying on your
hands and knees a better way to exit a smoke-filled room than
crawling along the floor like a snake?</TE>
<TE>   Tune in tonight and find out.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS' sophomore hit "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" drew a larger
audience than "ER" for the third time this season when both shows
offered an original episode, combining with the NCAA Final Four to
help the network outscore the competition last week, based on viewing
estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday's college basketball tournament coverage improved
slightly compared to last year, while CBS enjoyed a strong
performance from its Monday comedies, with "Yes, Dear" getting a
boost from following "Everybody Loves Raymond."</LD>
<LD>   The spring's new-series tryouts, meanwhile, continue to yield
mixed results. CBS' "Baby Bob," Fox's "Greg the Bunny" and ABC's
unscripted "The Bachelor" have all shown promise, while signs were
less encouraging for ABC's "Wednesday 9:30 (8:30 Central)" and NBC's
"Leap of Faith."</LD>
<TE>   ABC got a boost for its sluggish ratings from "The Ten
Commandments," as its 22nd telecast of the 1956 film won Sunday night
and delivered the network's highest rating of the week, although that
was only good enough for 24th among last week's prime-time offerings.</TE>

<HD>'Red Headed Stranger' Casts a Spell Over Bozulich and Pals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A canny blend of leather-worn country standards and original
compositions that sound like they could be, Willie Nelson's 1975
album "Red Headed Stranger" functions as a kind of informal concept
album about the itinerant life of an outlaw who has been betrayed.</LD>
<LD>   Because it ditches most of the usual frontier myths in favor of
songs that conflate love with an inchoate spiritual yearning, it
remains a powerful musical statement a quarter-century later.</LD>
<LD>   Former Geraldine Fibbers singer Carla Bozulich has felt the
irresistible tug of "Red Headed Stranger" so strongly that she
decided to pull together a touring band and play the album in its
entirety onstage.</LD>
<TE>   At Cafe Club Fais Do-Do on Monday, the band's first stop on its
national Nelson homage tour, Bozulich and the band--guitarist Nels
Cline, bassist Devin Hoff and drummer Scott Amendola--tapped into the
frayed heart of "Red Headed Stranger" without slavishly re-creating
the arrangements. Bozulich is not a country singer, but she has an
appealingly tremulous, melancholy catch in her voice that, in this
context, was evocatively utilized.</TE>
<TE>   Cline, a sneakily inventive guitarist, unraveled Nelson's
foursquare arrangements to allow Bozulich's voice to luxuriate in
them. The album's prim waltzes dissolved into ghostly dirges; ballads
were stretched out, giving Bozulich a wide berth to wallow.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything was word-perfect--the band stopped to gather itself
a few times--but that ramshackle spirit was a boon.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roasting is one of the easiest ways to cook whole fish, filets and
steaks. Baked at high heat without liquid, the fish cooks rapidly and
doesn't dry out. Unlike grilling, it poses no risk that bits of fish
might fall between grill bars. Because you don't have to contend with
the barbecue's searing heat, there's less risk of overcooking or
scorching the fish.</LD>
<LD>   To keep the fish moist during roasting, drizzle it with oil or
melted butter with minced garlic, lemon juice and herbs such as
thyme, oregano, dill or rosemary. For extra zip, spice it with
coriander, cumin, curry powder or cayenne pepper. Up to three of
these flavorings, along with salt and pepper, are enough to gently
accent the fish's taste. In the oven the fish acquires a light golden
hue, but you might like to sprinkle a pale fish with paprika before
cooking.</LD>
<LD>   Here I use pistou, a popular accompaniment for fish in Provence.
It's a simple pesto of basil, garlic and olive oil, often--unlike its
Italian cousin--without cheese, which might compete with the flavor
of the sea. It also contains no ground nuts. Pistou's color is
brightest if you use it right away, but you can keep it for a day in
the refrigerator.</LD>
<TE>   Before roasting fish, measure its thickness to estimate cooking
time. Most fish require 10 minutes an inch at a temperature of 425 to
450 degrees. Check the fish after seven or eight minutes, which may
be long enough for some fish, such as salmon, if you like it medium
(slightly pink in the center). When you're buying fish, freshness is
vital. Choose fish of good color that does not appear dry and does
not smell fishy. Ask to have any scales removed. If the market sells
only wrapped fish, check the "sell-by" date. Refrigerate the fish
promptly and cook it by the next day.</TE>

<TE>   Roasted Salmon With Pistou</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   You can substitute halibut or snapper but you may want to sprinkle
it with a little extra oil before baking. Served with asparagus and
new potatoes, this roasted fish is a festive welcome to spring.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds salmon steaks or 1 1/4 pounds filet, about 1
inch thick, cut in 4 pieces</TE>
<TE>   3 large cloves garlic, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried</TE>
<TE>   Cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   5 to 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 cups fresh basil leaves, about 2 (1-ounce) bunches, plus a few
sprigs for garnish</TE>
<TE>   4 cups baby lettuce</TE>
<TE>   20 cherry tomatoes, optional</TE>
<TE>   Lemon wedges, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 450 degrees. If the fish steaks have any scales,
scrape them off with a serrated knife, then rinse the steaks and pat
them dry. Line a heavy roasting pan with foil to make sure they won't
stick and for easy cleanup; lightly oil the foil or the pan. Set the
fish steaks side by side in the pan.</TE>
<TE>   Mince 1 garlic clove and put it in a small bowl. Add the lemon
juice, thyme, cayenne to taste and 1 tablespoon of oil. Sprinkle the
mixture on both sides of the fish steaks and rub it in. Sprinkle the
fish evenly with salt and pepper to taste, then let marinate briefly
while you prepare the pistou.</TE>
<TE>   Coarsely chop the remaining garlic and put it in a food processor.
Add the basil leaves and blend to chop the mixture finely. With the
motor running, gradually add 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Scrape down
the sides and process again so the mixture is well blended. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. If you like, add the remaining tablespoon
of olive oil and process briefly to blend. Reserve the pistou at room
temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Roast the fish in the oven for 5 minutes. If using fish steaks,
turn them over. Bake the fish for 3 more minutes. Pierce its thickest
part with the point of a thin knife and check its color inside. It
should be opaque and paler pink than when raw; if you like salmon
medium, its center should still be slightly deeper pink than its
sides. When you check with a fork, the fish should just begin to

<LD>In the 19th century, dishes were often named after celebrities. The
last gasp of this practice was probably the late '70s' Better Than
Robert Redford Cake.</LD>
<LD>   But it had a respectable pedigree going all the way back to
ancient Rome. The second-century cookbook of Apicius gives several
dishes named after Roman big shots, including pullus frontonianus,
which presumably refers to Marcus Cornelius Fronto, the greatest
orator of the day.</LD>
<LD>   Fronto was devoted to the art of public speaking in a way that is
hard for us non-Romans to imagine. To him, rhetoric, as the vehicle
of life's highest ideals, was the supreme human study, the only thing
in the universe that truly mattered. In a letter to his pupil Marcus
Aurelius, Fronto sternly chided the young emperor-to-be for wasting
his time studying philosophy (of course, these days Marcus Aurelius
is mostly remembered for his philosophical meditations).</LD>
<TE>   He scolded his erring student, "You seem to me to have, in the
fashion of the young, deserted the pursuit of eloquence and turned
aside to philosophy, in which there is no introductory section to be
elaborated, no account of the facts, bringing them together with
concision, clarity and skill."</TE>
<TE>   Philosophy, he continued, was a trivial business. After a
philosophical discussion, "you go away carefree, with nothing to
think over, or to write up at night, nothing to recite to your
master, nothing to say by heart, no search for words, no adorning of
a single synonym, no translation from Greek into our language."</TE>
<TE>   Well, golly, when you put it that way .... And nota bene (as the
Romans would say), Marcus Aurelius never got any chicken dishes named
after him.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, pullus frontonianus is pretty good. It's chicken fried
brown and then stewed with leeks, fish sauce, dill, savory and
cilantro. When it's done, you sprinkle it with pepper and defrutum,
which is wine boiled down to a syrup.</TE>

<HD>The King of Hawaiian Sweet Bread</HD>
<DH>Robert Taira, son of Okinawan immigrants, has built an
empire on puffy round loaves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King's Hawaiian Sweet Bread, that slightly sweet, remarkably puffy
bread sold in round aluminum trays, has become ubiquitous in Southern
California, despite the current trend to crusty sourdoughs. Beloved
for its cake-like taste and texture, in the 25 years that it's been
baked in Torrance, it's become a fixture at parties and buffets.
Anybody with kids certainly knows about it.</LD>
<LD>   The King's Hawaiian baking empire was built by Robert Taira, the
ninth-youngest of 11 children of Okinawan immigrants who had moved to
the island of Hawaii in 1906 to work on the sugar plantations. While
serving as a translator during the American occupation of Japan after
World War II, Taira saw that Japan would be a market for
Western-style goods once its economy recovered, and he decided to
start a business there.</LD>
<LD>   "Clothing," he recalls. "They weren't going to wear the kimono
anymore. Or maybe jewelry. I thought I might enjoy that."</LD>
<TE>   Eventually he decided to open a Western-style bakery in Tokyo.
When he was discharged from the Army, he attended baking schools in
Hilo, Hawaii, and in Chicago with that in mind, but the Korean War
intervened. "A civilian couldn't get a permit to go to Japan," he
explains.</TE>
<TE>   So in 1950 he opened a bakery back home in Hilo, boldly locating
it across the street from the top bakery in town. He was the youngest
of six sons, but he must have had the aura of destiny about him,
because his father decided to cash in his own life insurance to
bankroll it.</TE>
<TE>   His bakery produced far more sophisticated cakes than Hilo had
known, and it was a big success by local standards, but Taira wasn't
satisfied. In 1958 he started tinkering with a bread he had known
growing up in rural Hawaii. The Portuguese called it pao doce, which
is probably another name for massa sovada, the sweet bread the
Azorean Portuguese serve on the Feast of the Holy Ghost.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good bread," he says, "but we called it stone bread,
because in a day or so it would be as hard as a rock." He worked on
the recipe until he had a soft, long-keeping version. "I was always
thinking how to expand, and this was something I could wholesale," he
says. "It had never been a commercial product before."</TE>
<TE>   Since it was a luxury product, he had to charge about three times
as much as ordinary bread, so he decided to make it a round bread,
shaped more like a cake than a regular sandwich loaf. "That way, the
customers didn't think of it in the same category," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, he moved to Honolulu and set up a bakery and coffee shop,
again locating near other bakeries, figuring he would get their
customers, and soon he once again had the most popular bakery in
town. Since it was on King Street, it was named King's Bakery, and
that's how his product is called King's Hawaiian Sweet Bread.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bread was popular with tourists," he says. "People were
ordering it airmail, so we were selling 30,000 loaves a year that
way. We were the biggest customer at the Honolulu Post Office."</TE>
<TE>   So he decided to expand to the mainland and opened his first
Torrance bakery in 1977. "He'd come here and opened a bakery with
only one product and no market," says Shelby Weeda, now the president
of King's Hawaiian Bakery. "This was unheard of. He had a hard time
convincing markets to stock it, so he'd leave samples with the
executives' secretaries, and they'd convince the bosses."</TE>
<TE>   In a matter of months, the bread was in the supermarkets.
Eventually, in 1992, he closed his bakery in Hawaii, and Hawaiian
customers now get their Hawaiian Sweet Bread from here. The bread is
also sold everywhere in the country but the Northeast. It's in
Wal-Marts, it's available on military bases.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its round shape, it's hard to use for sandwiches in the
usual way, though many people slice it horizontally, fill the whole
loaf with a sandwich filling and then serve it in pie-type wedges.
Often a loaf is hollowed out and filled with chowder or a nacho-type
melted cheese sauce.</TE>
<TE>   "A few years back," says Weeda, "Stagg's Chili wanted our bread
for a commercial at the Super Bowl--they filled it with chili, it was
their 'super bowl'--and sales shot up. Now it's become a Super Bowl
tradition, and the first quarter of the year is one of our busiest."</TE>
<TE>   But people have devised a lot of other uses for the bread, such as
bread pudding, French toast, pull-apart bread, coffeecake, "cinnamon
rolls." One of the latest recipes on the company's Web site
(kingshawaiian.com) is a "rocky road" of bread mixed with chocolate,
pecans and marshmallows, a sort of non-baked bread pudding.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people just tear it apart before they get to the car," jests
Robert Taira. "That's the number one use of it."</TE>
<TE>   Making this bread is a huge operation. "We go through nine pallets
of eggs a day," says Gerry Kammel, the plant manager of King's
Hawaiian Bakery West in Torrance. "There are 30 cases to a pallet, 30
dozen to a case, so that's 8,100 dozen."</TE>
<TE>   When you're using close to 100,000 eggs a day, he adds, you don't
crack them one by one. You throw them in a centrifuge that breaks
them and separates the shells in one operation.</TE>
<TE>   When the freshly mixed dough--so soft it's almost a batter--has
spent awhile in a warm, steamy room to get the yeast started, it's
hauled up to a machine that shapes it into balls that go into the
container they will be baked in, either individual aluminum trays for
the sweet bread or paper boxes for the sweet rolls. They spend about
an hour on a conveyor belt that spirals up and down inside a heated
tower for the dough to rise.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," says Kammel, taking a box of risen roll dough off the
conveyor belt. He gently touches the dough with a fingertip; it
collapses. "This is such a soft dough," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The loaves spend 16 minutes baking in a conveyor oven, then an
hour spiraling up and down in a gigantic cooling tower that looks
like something from a sci-fi movie. From ingredients to wrapping
station, the whole process takes a little more than four hours.</TE>
<TE>   This plant turns out 100 loaves a minute, running 23 hours a day.
Spring is a slow season, Kammel says, so the bakery shuts down on
Sundays. From late summer until the big winter holidays, it will run
seven days, baking pretty close to a million loaves a week. Many will
be frozen for sale during the holidays, the preeminent sweet bread
season. The company currently takes in about $50 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   King's Hawaiian has another bakery nearby. It has been pioneering
automated baking equipment, including a continuous mixer. Instead of
being mixed in batches, a continuous flow of dough is driven down a
tube by a worm drive which kneads it and at the same time mixes it
with ingredients as they're "metered in" along the way.</TE>
<TE>   But both plants will soon be shut down. By the end of the year,
the company expects to open a totally automated 148,000-square-foot
bakery in Harbor Gateway that will triple its output. "It's the only
way to go," says Weeda. "You can't get people to be bakers anymore."</TE>
<TE>   It will make the company's familiar breads and rolls, but it will
introduce new products too, such as sliced Hawaiian Sweet Bread.</TE>
<TE>   Taira was a pastry baker before he ever made the sweet bread, and
when he opened King's Hawaiian Bakery &amp; Restaurant (also in Torrance,
like the two mass-production bakeries) in 1988, he offered a wide
range of cakes, including remarkably delicate chiffon cakes--they
jiggle at a touch--with tropical fruit fillings. By the end of next
year the new bakery will be producing these cakes for wholesale.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant serves an upscale version of Hawaiian Local Food:
wontons, teriyaki, Portuguese sausage rolls, Korean-type barbecue,
Hawaiian kalua pork, loco moco (a hamburger topped with fried eggs
and gravy, served on rice). There are also plans for a fast-food
edition of the restaurant. "It's always been the combination that
makes our business successful, the food and the bakery products,"
says Mark Taira, who has been the company's chief executive since his
father's retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "The world is getting smaller," says Robert Taira. "So my
long-term goal is selling internationally. I've had requests from
China, Japan, Indonesia, Australia."</TE>
<TE>   So he might open that bakery in Tokyo after all.</TE>
<TE>   King's Hawaiian Sweet Bread is available at supermarkets. King's
Hawaiian Bakery and Restaurant is at 2808 W. Sepulveda Blvd.,
Torrance, (310) 530-0050.</TE>

<LD>Spring always brings plenty of young asparagus, pencil-thin with
bright green stems. But too many dishes cover up the fresh taste of
the asparagus with a fattening sauce.</LD>
<LD>   This simple, Japanese-style soy dressing is flavored with toasted
sesame seeds rather than oil and uses mirin, a sweet rice wine found
in Japanese and gourmet markets.</LD>
<LD>   Steaming the asparagus also keeps the fat away. It's best to cook
asparagus within a day or two of purchase. Store asparagus in the
refrigerator until using. Set it in a glass of water so that the ends
are covered, just like a bunch of flowers.</LD>

medium-low heat until they turn light brown and become aromatic, 1
minute. Watch carefully; they tend to brown quickly. Crush the seeds

<AU>DAVID KARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Long Beach downtown farmers market, founded in 1980, recently
sustained two blows: It had to move half a block to a location with
less free parking, and the newer Sunday market at the Long Beach
Marina has drawn away many of its more affluent customers. Dale
Whitney, the manager, hopes that in a month or so the market will
return to its original spot, on the Promenade north of Broadway. As
for now, the market continues and still has some good farmers.</LD>
<LD>   Shoppers at the ABC Rhubarb stand sometimes wonder about the
farm's name, since it sells mostly herbs and greens. On Friday, for
example, its display included a fine salad mix, dill, hothouse-grown
basil, fresh aloe leaves and rue, an aromatic herb used in salads and
for seasoning. Family patriarch Martin Baltazar, who presides with
his daughter Lilly, explained that when he came to California in
1965, he grew rhubarb. He later expanded into herbs, which he now
farms under the power lines in Bell Gardens on land leased from an
oil company in Carson and on his own property in Fillmore. "ABC," by
the way, came from the initials of his son; the farm still harvests
rhubarb in autumn.</LD>
<TE>   Among other veggie vendors, the Nakamura Farm of Oxnard sold
organic fava beans, red and gold beets, leeks and spinach. Smith
Farms had artichokes, fresh Maui onions, slender asparagus and nice
red-leaf and green-leaf lettuce from Irvine and Fountain Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Nejely of Fallbrook sold buttery Fuerte avocados, as well as
custardy Booth cherimoyas and golden ripe sapotes, which taste like
banana flan. This season the navel orange crop in the Central Valley
was small, so the individual fruits grew exceptionally large. Jim Van
Foeken of Ivanhoe had truly gigantic specimens, some weighing as much
as 2 1/2 pounds, but his medium-size fruits, sold in bags, offered
better flavor and texture. His Fairchild mandarins were very sweet
and juicy, much better than the main commercial crop of this variety,
mostly harvested in November from the Coachella Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Desert-grown grapefruit, however, is now at peak quality, judging
by those offered by Rudy Yanez of Thermal; the Rio Reds are darker
and sweeter, though the Rubys had more intense flavor. He also sold
medjool, honey and deglet noor dates.</TE>

<HD>ONIGIRI</HD>
<DH>Calling them rice balls is missing the point. These
Japanese snacks are full of surprises.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BENDER</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Onigiri--perhaps the most popular food in Japan after the
hamburger--go back more than a millennium but are as contemporary as
Pokemon.</LD>
<LD>   They're often called rice balls in English, but that hardly begins
to tell the story. Onigiri are made of cooked Japanese rice, usually
pressed into an equilateral triangle about three inches across and
one inch thick, but they might be cylindrical or ball-shaped. At the
center there's often a treasure--a pinch of grilled salmon, some cod
roe, a Japanese pickled plum or a dollop of kombu (kelp) marinated in
soy sauce. Sometimes onigiri come dusted with sesame seeds or flakes
of dried fish, or you can wrap the whole concoction in a sheet of
crisp dried nori seaweed and create what looks like a miniature
Noguchi sculpture.</LD>
<LD>   Some food historians say that onigiri--the word comes from a root
meaning "made by gripping with the hands," as in nigiri-sushi--got
their start as road food for soldiers during the Heian Period
(794-1192); the saltiness of the fillings is said to have acted as a
preservative. Others say that onigiri were originally doled out by
nobles to peasants gathered outside their gates.</LD>
<TE>   More recently, generations of Japanese schoolkids have packed
onigiri in their lunch bentos, golfers and hikers take them--along
with cans of green or oolong tea--for long days in the great
outdoors, and Japanese airlines have been known to serve them as
mid-flight snacks.</TE>
<TE>   "My baachan [grandma] used to make onigiri as an after-school
snack," recalls Kyle Inouye of Sherman Oaks. "I suspect it was to
fill my mouth up, so I'd be quiet for once. But like anything she
would make for me, it was the most amazing thing to eat, even though
it was mostly just rice pushed together."</TE>
<TE>   Many visitors to Japan don't consider that they've actually
arrived until they've eaten an onigiri.</TE>
<TE>   Onigiri can also be grilled over the same fire used for chicken or
fish. The outside should turn a little crisp, and when an onigiri is
brushed with soy sauce toward the end of the cooking process, it
takes on a nutty sweetness. These yaki-onigiri (from the same root
"yaki," meaning to grill, as in yakitori), sometimes take the place
of dessert in Japanese grill restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The modern onigiri has practically gone free-form. Bite into one
and you might find a distinctly nontraditional filling: mayonnaise-y
tuna salad, karashi mentaiko (spicy cod roe), negi-toro (raw fatty
tuna with sliced green onion) or ingredients of Korean origin such as
kimchi or yaki-niku (garlicky grilled beef). In Hawaii, where onigiri
are called musubi (a name that in Japan is used only for roundish
onigiri), the most popular variety is topped with a slab of Spam
brushed with teriyaki sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Onigiri may have once come courtesy of nobles, but in today's
Japan they come courtesy of 7-Eleven or other convenience stores. In
Los Angeles, you can find them at Japanese grocers. On either side of
the ocean, less than a dollar can buy you an onigiri in a nifty
plastic wrapping with a special sheath to keep the nori crisp.</TE>
<TE>   They're also easy to make at home, starting with warm cooked rice.
Inouye recalls his grandmother washing her hands, "and while they
were still not fully dried she'd rub table salt on them as if it was
lotion, pick up the rice and sculpt away."</TE>
<TE>   Different families favor different shapes for onigiri. "In my
family we make onigiri in a shape called tawaragata, kind of like a
capsule," says Kari Hynek, a native of Japan now living in Los
Angeles. "But there are rectangle families, ball families and
triangle families."</TE>
<TE>   Though shaping onigiri seems simple enough, it helps to buy a
mold. Not only will onigiri molds allow you to turn out perfect
shapes even if you're not a natural sculptor, they are also some of
the coolest kitchen gadgets around.</TE>
<TE>   One, called the norimaki nigiri, looks like a pup tent with slots
like on a miter box. You line the inside of the mold with a sheet of
nori seaweed or plastic wrap, layer in rice, fillings and more rice,
and clamp the whole thing down with the base of the mold. Then you
use a knife to slice through the slots to form the individual
triangles. Genius. You can also get molds in the tawaragata shape, or
like dainty flora, although some of them make only one onigiri at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   To wrap your onigiri, Japanese markets sell packages of toasted
nori (yakinori). And in case you're planning on eating your onigiri
later, the Yamamotoyama company has thoughtfully wrapped the nori
sheets in the same sort of plastic sleeve you find with the
commercially packaged onigiri. Note that yaki-onigiri are not wrapped
in nori. Heavens, no.</TE>
<TE>   If you prefer your non-yaki-onigiri undressed, a popular simple
preparation is to sprinkle them with furikake: flakes of dried fish,
seaweed, dried egg or sesame seeds, sold in jars with shaker tops and
traditionally used to flavor rice for kids. Yaki-onigiri might be
garnished with katsuo-bushi, flakes of dried bonito, or with a couple
of slices of yellow Japanese pickled radish (takuan).</TE>
<TE>   Think of something else you'd like to try inside? Go ahead. Be
creative. Have a ball--or a triangle.</TE>

<TE>   Basic Onigiri</TE>
<TE>   Active Work: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 10
minutes</TE>
<TE>   Japanese short-grain rice and nori are available at Asian markets.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup Japanese short-grain rice</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   About 2 ounces grilled salmon</TE>
<TE>   2 (7x6-inch) sheets nori</TE>
<TE>   Place the rice and 1 1/4 cups cold water in a saucepan and soak
for 30 minutes. Bring to a boil over medium heat, lower the heat,
cover and simmer until the liquid has been absorbed, 20 minutes. Let
stand, covered, 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't have an onigiri mold, wet your hands in water, dust
with salt if desired, and divide the fresh rice (it should still be
warm) into 4 balls. Place each ball on a sheet of plastic wrap to
make molding easier.</TE>
<TE>   Poke a hole in each rice ball. Divide the salmon evenly among the
balls, filling the holes; smooth the rice over the filling. Form each
ball into the shape of your choice. For a triangle, set the rice onto
the palm of your hand, and form the triangle by holding the other
hand in an A-shape. Note that the sides of the triangle should be
flat.</TE>
<TE>   If the nori sheets are not perforated, slice each in half
horizontally. To wrap a triangular onigiri, stand it up horizontally
about halfway down the sheet, so that the ends touch each side, then
fold the ends of the sheet around it.</TE>
<TE>   Serve immediately so that the nori stays crisp. If you cannot
serve immediately, wrap the onigiri in plastic wrap and place in the
refrigerator, then wrap in nori just before serving. That is, of
course, unless you don't mind soggy nori.</TE>
<TE>   If you have an onigiri mold, line the mold with plastic wrap.</TE>
<TE>   Line the bottom of the mold with a layer of rice, and make a line
of the filling of your choice down the center on top of the rice.
Then fill the rest of the mold with more rice and press with the base
of the mold.</TE>
<TE>   Using a sharp knife, slice the rice through the slits in the mold.
Remove the base, and slide the onigiri out gently. Remove the onigiri
from the plastic and wrap them in nori as above.</TE>
<TE>   4 onigiri. Each onigiri: 84 calories; 11 mg sodium; 9 mg
cholesterol; 2 grams fat; 0 saturated fat; 12 grams carbohydrates; 4
grams protein; 0.56 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Variations: Fill each onigiri with a Japanese pickled plum rather
than the grilled salmon. Or, soak 1/4 cup dried bonito flakes in 4
teaspoons of soy sauce, then divide the filling among the onigiri.</TE>
<TE>   Or, instead of filling the onigiri, sprinkle them with your choice
of furikake (Japanese flavorings for rice) once they're formed.
Standing the triangles up and sprinkling them over the tops makes for
a nice presentation. Garnish with Japanese pickles.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of wrapping the entire onigiri, slice the nori into strips
and wrap around the edges, then sprinkle the flat parts with
furikake. If you're using an onigiri mold, you can line the mold with
a sheet of nori instead of plastic wrap to achieve the same effect.</TE>
<TE>   Mix black sesame seeds (kurogoma) in with the rice before forming
your rice balls. In this case, most kitchens won't wrap the onigiri
in a full sheet of nori.</TE>

<TE>   Japanese short-grain rice, takuan pickles and dried bonito flakes
are available at Asian markets.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup Japanese short-grain rice</TE>
<TE>   Salt, optional</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   Sliced takuan pickles or dried bonito flakes (katsuo-bushi)</TE>
<TE>   Place the rice and 1 1/4 cups cold water in a saucepan and soak
for 30 minutes. Bring to a boil over medium heat, lower the heat,
cover and simmer until the liquid has been absorbed, 20 minutes. Let
stand, covered, 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a charcoal grill or grill pan over low heat.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't have an onigiri mold, wet your hands in water, dust
with salt if desired, and divide the fresh rice (it should still be
warm) into 4 balls. Place each ball on a sheet of plastic wrap to
make molding easier.</TE>
<TE>   Place the onigiri on the grill or grill pan (the grill's bars
should not be too far apart). Turn over when the edges start to turn
brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn over again if necessary until both sides
are light brown--be careful not to let the rice burn. Brush one side
lightly with soy sauce and place back on the grill, soy sauce side
down, for about 30 seconds. Repeat with the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Serve immediately, and garnish the plate with takuan pickles or a
small mound of bonito flakes topped with a splash of soy sauce.</TE>
<TE>   4 servings. Each serving: 59 calories; 338 mg sodium; 0
cholesterol; 0 fat; 0 saturated fat; 12 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams
protein; 0.61 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Variation: Roll the edges of the triangles in roasted brown sesame
seeds before grilling.</TE>

<LD>Edamame, or fresh soybeans, are often served at Japanese restaurants.
But they're also easy to fix at home in a stir-fry.</LD>
<LD>   Specialty markets and well-stocked supermarkets sell edamame in
the frozen food aisle. Usually the soybeans are in the pod, to be
steamed or boiled before serving. Look for shelled edamame, if you
can find them, to save time. But if you can't, it doesn't take long
to pop the beans from the pods.</LD>
<LD>   Use vegetarian oyster sauce and water (in place of the broth) for
a vegetarian dish, or make the stir-fry a little meatier by adding a
handful of cooked shrimp or scallops. Vegetarian oyster sauce can be
found at Asian grocery stores.</LD>

<TE>   Dash white pepper</TE>
<TE>   Cooked white or brown rice, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Heat a skillet over high heat and add the oil. Wait until a wisp
of white smoke appears, then add the garlic and cook, stirring, until
light brown, about 20 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Stir in the edamame, snow peas and cabbage and reduce the heat to
medium. Add the water or chicken stock and cook, covered, for 30
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Stir in the oyster sauce and soy sauce, making sure to coat all
the vegetables well, and cook for about 30 seconds. Once the
vegetables are cooked through but still crisp, 4 to 5 minutes, add
the white pepper. Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary. Serve
it with rice.</TE>

<HD>Souffles Without the Fear</HD>
<DH>They're a perfect way to use leftovers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE SAMPSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like Parisians, souffles have a reputation for being fussy. "Why
bother?" I had always thought until I recently faced a Friday night
with time for cooking but an all-but-barren fridge. A trip to the
store would have sapped all my creative energy, so I looked again at
the lonely egg carton.</LD>
<LD>   I recalled a brief conversation I once had with a chef I worked
for. "I love making souffles," he said. "They seem hard, but they're
so easy."</LD>
<LD>   But could a chef be trusted in matters of home cooking? When I
found half a yellow onion, a semi-dry hunk of Parmesan and a box of
frozen spinach, I decided, "Souffle, it's what's for dinner."</LD>
<TE>   I went straight for Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French
Cooking, Volume I" and opened a bottle of Chardonnay to drink while
studying it. According to the formula on page 163, my meager supplies
could be transformed into a six- or eight-cup souffle. And it could
be made with just about anything from grated cheese to canned
crabmeat to winter greens or mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Thus deconstructed, I realized that souffle is just a pantry dish
with airs. Forget casseroles--this is a weekend way to use up
leftovers.</TE>
<TE>   Baked souffles, whether they're for dinner or dessert, are made
from three basic parts: the base (which is usually a thick cream
sauce combined with egg yolks), the main flavor ingredient and
whipped egg whites. It's a three-step procedure, more mechanics than
culinary artistry. And it only requires one pan, one bowl and a glass
or porcelain baking dish.</TE>
<TE>   I dutifully separated the requisite number of eggs and relaxed
into the lock-step progression of cooking the roux: melting the
butter, adding the flour and cooking it until it smelled nutty,
adding the liquid and simmering it until thick. I stirred in the
cooked spinach (I'd improvised a bit, cooking it with garlic, crushed
red pepper and a splash of wine) and the egg yolks. I beat the whites
and stirred some of them into the base to lighten it, then gently
folded in the rest.</TE>
<TE>   For all my trepidation, souffles really are nearly foolproof. I
should know: I once accidentally mistook a cookie batter for a
dessert souffle base. After I folded in the whipped egg whites, I
held my breath as the individual souffles went into the oven.
Surprise! They rose beautifully.</TE>
<TE>   The thing my near-disaster proved is that the magic of the souffle
is in the egg whites. Whipped to soft, droopy peaks, their air cells
expand in the hot oven and raise the souffle like a spring shoot
emerging from the ground--no parchment paper collar required.</TE>
<TE>   Many souffles don't even require a white sauce, just something
thick to use as a base. In fact, most dessert souffles are made this
way--thick melted chocolate will work just fine; so will something as
simple as melted jam.</TE>
<TE>   Once the souffle was safely baking, I turned on the oven light and
stood back with my glass of wine to watch the show. Soon, it began a
steady rise, climbing the sides of the baking dish on a coating of
grated cheese and growing a beautifully caramelized crown.</TE>
<TE>   I ended up undercooking my spinach souffle slightly, so I just
sent it straight back into the oven. And once it was done there was
no need for panic. Though it started to sink as soon as I served it,
the souffle stayed unctuous and light, singing the clean flavor of
spinach, even when we went back for seconds.</TE>

<TE>   Spinach Souffle</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 25 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour *
Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Adapted from "Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume I" by
Julia Child (Knopf, 1961).</TE>
<TE>   3 1/2 tablespoons (about 1/2 stick) butter, plus more for
preparing dish</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan or bread crumbs, divided</TE>
<TE>   3 1/2 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   6 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 cups cooked spinach or Swiss chard</TE>
<TE>   7 egg whites</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Butter a 2 1/2-quart capacity,
straight-sided baking dish and coat lightly but evenly with 2
tablespoons of the cheese or bread crumbs.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the flour
and cook, stirring, until the roux smells nutty but before it browns,
about 2 minutes. Whisk in the milk and continue whisking until the
sauce is as thick as paste. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in
the yolks one at a time. Season the souffle base with salt, pepper
and the nutmeg. Generously season the spinach or chard and stir it
into the souffle base with the remaining cheese or bread crumbs.</TE>
<TE>   Add a dash of salt to the egg whites and beat them in a standing
mixer with the whisk attachment until they are glossy and form supple
peaks, about 4 minutes. Stir half of the egg whites into the souffle
base mixture, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Pour the
batter into the prepared dish, smoothing the top.</TE>
<TE>   Place the dish on the middle rack and immediately turn the
temperature down to 375 degrees. Bake the souffle without disturbing
until it is puffed and the top is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.</TE>

Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   This classic California souffle is adapted from Alice Waters' "The
Chez Panisse Menu Cookbook" (Random House, 1982).</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for preparing
dish</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups half-and-half</TE>
<TE>   1 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Grated nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   Black pepper</TE>
<TE>   5 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   6 ounces crumbled strong-flavored goat cheese</TE>
<TE>   Cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 cup egg whites (from about 8 eggs)</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a saucepan and whisk in the flour. Cook them
gently for 5 to 8 minutes. In a separate small pan, scald the
half-and-half and whipping cream. Remove the roux from the heat and
cool slightly before whisking in the scalded creams. Transfer the
sauce to a double boiler and season it lightly with salt, a dash of
nutmeg and black pepper. Cover and cook slowly for about 1 hour,
stirring occasionally. Allow to cool slightly before adding the rest
of the ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Generously butter a 12-inch oval
casserole or 6 (6-inch) shallow gratin dishes.</TE>
<TE>   Stir the egg yolks into the sauce, then add the goat cheese;
season with a dash of cayenne. Put the remaining 2 ounces of crumbled
cheese on top of the mixture and sprinkle with black pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold into the cheese mixture.
The mixture should be fairly loose, but not runny. Pour the souffle
mixture gently into the casserole or gratin dishes. Sprinkle the
dried thyme lightly over the top and bake on the top shelf of the
oven until the top and sides are well-browned and the inside warm and
creamy, 15 to 17 minutes.</TE>

<HD>What Happens When You Age California Pinot Noirs?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Older wines are notoriously fickle. Some age the way you'd expect,
others go off in directions not at all evident when they were young.
Over the centuries, Europeans have come to understand a thing or two
about how their wines age, but New World vintners are still in the
learning process.</LD>
<LD>   This is true even with such thoroughly studied grapes as Cabernet
Sauvignon. These days we know pretty well how Cabs will age, and
we've learned a bit about why some vintages hold up better than
others. But even with this grape there are questions. The Cabernets
of the 1990s are bigger, richer, deeper, riper, more open and more
alcoholic than earlier vintages. Will wines that are so opulent in
youth age the same way as earlier vintages made in a tighter style?</LD>
<LD>   Pinot Noir is even more troublesome. Indeed, there are those who
argue that Pinot Noir will never taste better than it does when it is
first released. Look at the opulent fruit, they say. Look at the
already lush texture. Look at the relative lack of tannin. It's hard
to disagree.</LD>
<TE>   Still, many California Pinot Noirs have aged gracefully over the
years. Since the grape is an ever more important part of the state's
wine scene, now is a good time to look more closely at how Pinots
change over time.</TE>
<TE>   We don't have as long a track record on Pinot as we have for
Cabernet. The early years of California Pinot Noir were not happy
ones. Not only were many of the first vineyards in the wrong places,
but the notoriously fickle grape also produced wines that differed
from year to year for seemingly little reason.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, Pinot is not nearly as predictable as Cabernet. In the
1990s, for instance, when California plantings had largely shifted to
hospitable places such as the Russian River Valley, Carneros and
Santa Barbara County, Pinot only produced three across-the-board good
vintages (1990, 1994 and 1999). Every other year has been spotty.</TE>
<TE>   It may be hard to draw any strict rules about California Pinot
Noir from this tasting, but it's striking how well many of these
supposedly short-lived wines pulled from the cellar have aged.</TE>
<TE>   1980 HMR Winery, Paso Robles. The old Hoffman Mountain Ranch in
the hills west of Paso Robles produced admirable Pinot Noirs from a
site rich in chalk and limestone. This wine is typical of those
fairly ripe yet balanced early efforts, and it has held up amazingly
well. Its texture is all Pinot, and its flavors, while certainly no
longer vigorous, are rich with fruit and suggestions of cherries,
smoke and tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   1981 Kenwood Vineyards "Jack London Vineyard," Sonoma Valley.
Everything that comes out of this mountain vineyard tends to
sturdiness and high ripeness. In that regard, this wine does give us
some idea how grapes grown in higher terrains might fare over time.
It shows its age in tobacco and cedar aromas, yet there are also
clear notes of blackberry, pepper and walnuts and a fleshy, supple
texture on the palate. While the nose hints at some weariness, the
mouth is surprising alive for a Pinot Noir of two decades.</TE>
<TE>   1982 Calera "Jensen Vineyard," Central Coast. This wine has aged
exactly as you'd expect. It has always had a bit of a volatile note,
which continues to raise eyebrows with aromas that are at once
expansive and somewhat narrow. In the mouth, the wine fights against
the pinching aspects of the sharpness, but you can easily detect the
flavors of ripe cherries and toasty oak.</TE>
<TE>   1983 Gary Farrell, Russian River Valley. Farrell's Pinot Noirs are
balanced, refined and graceful. Some are less intense than they might
be because they are not pushed into super-ripeness, but all share the
same good manners and sense of proportion. This wine, too, has lost
something in the nose over the years, but the flavors are still
bright and lively.</TE>
<TE>   1984 McHenry Winery, Santa Cruz Mountains. This winery didn't last
long and had only four acres to pull grapes from, but this Pinot Noir
is one of its successes. Even today, it's ripe, supple and somewhat
velvety in feel, and its first flavors of concentrated cherries are
undone only slightly by the latter dryness on the palate to be
expected in a modest wine of its age.</TE>
<TE>   1985 Acacia Winery, Carneros. This wine was made in a lighter,
somewhat fruitier style. It was never intended to last this long, but
somehow it has. The clean, strawberry jam aromas are tinged with
touches of toffee and caramel and a light layering of vanilla. The
texture is soft and velvety, and the flavors are very much as
predicted by the nose. A bit of drying out shows up at the finish,
but that, too, is pretty much as expected. All in all, this wine has
had a heck of a good ride and makes a strong case for the ageability
of balanced Carneros Pinot Noirs.</TE>
<TE>   1986 Elk Cove Vineyards "Estate Bottled Reserve," Oregon. We liked
this wine when it was released and are now disappointed that it has
turned heavy, blocky and somewhat woody without richness. Older wines
can break your heart, and we never open one for dinner without having
a backup ready.</TE>
<TE>   1987 Carneros Creek Winery, Carneros. This two-star wine was a
forerunner of the ripe, deep model now popular among Pinot Noir
makers. Today, it is a mix of the unusual, the merely nice and the
absolutely lovely. Its first aromas are a bit dry, ripe and herbal,
but airing brings out layers of cherries and a very clear sense of
succulence along with some vanillin-scented oakiness. In the mouth,
the wine simply sings, with its velvety, somewhat fleshy texture
supported by plenty of still-vibrant fruit. Surprisingly, it also
carries a rough streak of tannin in the finish. It may never become
truly soft and open, but it's a delightful wine now and should age
for another five years at least.</TE>
<TE>   1988 Calera "Mills Vineyard," Central Coast. Our first and lasting
impression of this wine is that it exemplifies the Calera family. The
deep and compelling fruit is holding very well, as is the angularity
that often is part of Calera Pinots. We like this one somewhat more
than the 1982 Calera "Jensen" reviewed above, and given its depth and
density, it should hold up better over time.</TE>
<TE>   1989 Newlan Vineyards "Vieilles Vignes," Napa Valley. Bruce Newlan
never made enough wine to get the attention he deserved; perhaps
he'll be more successful with his new venture--designing and building
ultralight airplanes. Originally a two-star effort from a difficult
vintage, this wine is doing very well at age 12 and will last a few
years more. It is showing a bit of tobacco leaf along with its sweet
spice/dried flower aromas. Still, it is round and has a bit of velvet
texture before getting a bit firmer, drier and stiffer as it
progresses. We would not look for much more improvement with this
one.</TE>
<TE>   1990 Gary Farrell "Bien Nacido Vineyard," Santa Maria Valley. As
impressed as we were by how well the 1983 Farrell Pinot has aged,
this one is going to be even better. It still smells and tastes of
youth, with pulpy, succulent black cherry notes playing off against
attractive oak, and a supple, firm texture that means it should hold
for five to 10 more years.</TE>
<TE>   1991 Kistler Vineyards "McCrea Vineyard," Sonoma Mountain. If the
1987 Carneros Creek was big, this bottling from Kistler was even
bigger. Its fruit is still young and amazingly, tantalizingly deep,
though with hints of chocolate and alcoholic heat that raise
questions about how much further it will go before those elements
take over. Our guess is five to 10 years, and we take this wine as
proof that the best of the big 1990s-era versions will prove to be
longer-lived than many pundits and collectors believe.</TE>

<LD>Chinese chicken with orange sauce is terrific even without the
chicken, as in Kung Pao Bistro's adaptation of this dish for
vegetarians. A soy product with the texture of chicken is cut into
bite-size pieces and combined with the spicy, sweet orange sauce.
Steamed white or brown rice and a fortune cookie come with the order.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several years ago wine importer Kermit Lynch and the Brunier family
from the famed Chateauneuf-du-Pape estate Le Vieux Telegraph (which
Lynch imports) got together to buy this Gigondas property. This is
the best vintage they've produced yet. It's a deep, saturated red
with the scent of sweet spiced plums and a taste like blackberries
and the sun-baked Provencal earth. With its ripe tannins, it's as
vibrant and silky as a Burgundy. This is a real beauty with food,
particularly roast lamb or pork or grilled meat. Drink it now or put
it away for a while.</LD>
<LD>   About $25. Available at Top- line Wine &amp; Spirits in Glendale,
(818) 500-9670, Conejo Wine and Provision in Thousand Oaks, (805)
496-1324 and Barons in Del Mar, (858) 481-2323. If you can't find
this wine, have your local store contact the distributor, Pacific
Coast Wine Marketing, (800) 619-7776.</LD>

<HD>Pushing His Students Onto the World Stage</HD>
<DH>Model U.N. squad at Mira Costa High is one of the nation's
best, getting top honors again at New York competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The delegate from the People's Republic of China was taking a verbal
beating. Slouched on an old car seat, wearing baggy shorts, finishing
up a hamburger, he was trying to explain his country's position on
illegal trafficking in nuclear waste.</LD>
<LD>   But the inquisitor wasn't buying it. "You've got hot air is what
you've got," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Such bluntness is rare in the polite, coded discourse of
international diplomacy. But it's common in the classroom presided
over by Bob Timberlake at Manhattan Beach's Mira Costa High School.
Timberlake was grilling Daniel Morberg, 16, to prepare him for a
simulated United Nations conference, during which he and his
classmates would appear as Chinese diplomats.</LD>
<TE>   There was nothing simulated about Timberlake's intense
questioning, however. And, afterward, a somewhat shaken Daniel said
he felt like "an idiot." But, he said, "it just motivates me to work
more. It's kind of toughening."</TE>
<TE>   Timberlake's confrontational Socratic method of teaching does make
some students uncomfortable at first. It goes against the grain of
feel-good pedagogical theories, which say that teachers should create
a "safe" environment where students' opinions go unchallenged. And
it's meant to get their competitive juices flowing--another no-no
among some education theorists.</TE>
<TE>   But Timberlake and his students agree that his hard-nosed approach
is largely responsible for why the school's Model United Nations
squad is one of the best in the nation and why they traveled last
week to the highly competitive national conference in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "He pushes and he pushes and he pushes, but it's only because he
knows we're capable of it," said Karen Block, 17, who has been a
member of Timberlake's Model U.N. team for four years.</TE>
<TE>   Model U.N. has a long history, dating to the post-World War I
League of Nations, when college students would mimic the debates of
diplomats as a learning exercise. These days, about 300,000 students
around the world--about half of them of high school age--participate
in conferences during which they try to solve the world's economic,
political, environmental, educational and social problems.</TE>
<TE>   The activity is growing in popularity, and its major advocate, the
United Nations Assn. of the U.S., is trying to get more schools
involved by sponsoring programs in New York, Chicago, Oakland and
other cities. Southern California has strong teams at Edison High
School in Huntington Beach, and Cerritos and Huntington Beach high
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Before a conference, each team is assigned a country, and its
members research and write papers explaining their adopted nation's
positions on the issues. It's not always a big country. At a
conference three years ago at Georgetown University, Mira Costa's
team represented Cape Verde, the group of islands off the west coast
of Africa. Although the country is obscure and all but powerless on
the world stage, Mira Costa swept the conference and won numerous
individual and team honors.</TE>
<TE>   The awards--gavels, plaques and national flags--are given for such
things as making a good speech, steering a caucus discussion in a
direction favorable to your interests or getting a resolution passed.
Testifying to the team's success over the years are the 66 flags, 55
plaques and nearly 200 gavels that adorn the walls of Timberlake's
classroom. In three of the last 10 years, the team has won every
conference it attended.</TE>
<TE>   The New York conference is one of the biggest in the country,
attracting 220 schools and 2,400 students, all of them determined to
make their views known. The team got to eat in the delegates' dining
room at the U.N., lunching with diplomats. They saw a play and
visited the site of the World Trade Center disaster site. But the
trip, paid for with donations from local service clubs and by parents
to help cover the $900 per student cost, was mainly devoted to doing
well at the conference.</TE>
<TE>   To make sure they're ready, Timberlake secures subscriptions to
university archives and foreign affairs news services. That helped
them learn China's position on issues large and small.</TE>
<TE>   What's China's view of how best to help the Arab world diversify
its economy so it's not so dependent on oil? What role does China
play in the small arms trade that's contributing to the mounting
casualties in the civil war underway in Sierra Leone? What's its
record on women's rights? On unions? Stemming the spread of AIDS in
Africa?</TE>
<TE>   "I love it, I absolutely love it," said Karen, who will attend
Union College in upstate New York in the fall. "I love being able to
talk to friends about actual issues and not just about, 'Oh, look at
that cute boy.'"</TE>
<TE>   She had to research China's position on "tele-work," the growing
phenomenon of people working via computer for employers who may be
across the country or around the world. She traveled to Ecuador two
years ago and wants to work for the government or become a lawyer.
"I've lived in Manhattan Beach my whole life ... and I really want to
get beyond my comfort level," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As a final step to make sure his team is ready, Timberlake
conducts what he calls "roasts," starting at 6:30 a.m. before school
and at 6 p.m. after school and lasting as late as 9 p.m., the week
before the conference. The students are all put on the hot seat, just
as Daniel was.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a gut check to see if they're ready and prepared," said
Timberlake, 46, who has been on the Mira Costa faculty for 15 years.
He teaches geography, helps coach the school's golf team and used to
coach its football team.</TE>
<TE>   As he grills the students, Timberlake displays a near-encyclopedic
knowledge of world affairs, he cites articles in obscure journals,
drops the name of a West African rebel leader, mentions a 1948 treaty
in which China bamboozled India and directs students to relevant Web
sites. "How can I ask them to know their stuff if I don't know my
stuff?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Shy students blossom, once they realize they can stand up to the
pressure. "I've seen him do it to my kids, and they came away really
wanting to prove themselves to him," said Pam Seaborn, an
enthusiastic parent who heads the team's booster club. "I know
personally he really loves these kids and always has their best
interests at heart."</TE>
<TE>   All the hard work paid off again in New York. The team won the
conference's top award. Timberlake loves it when his team wins. But
even if they don't, he said, "The quality of effort they put in,
that's what's most important to me."</TE>
<TE>   It may be the most valuable lesson his students learn.</TE>

<HD>Pace of Dividend Increases Weakens in March</HD>
<DH>Outlook: A turnaround in profits later this year still is
expected to make more firms willing to boost payouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The outlook for corporate cash dividends deteriorated again in March
after improving in January and February.</LD>
<LD>   The total number of companies raising dividend payments to
shareholders fell to 110 in March from 126 a year earlier, Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said.</LD>
<LD>   Dividend increases, which have been waning for more than two years
as companies opt to conserve cash, had stabilized in January and
February at about the same rate as a year earlier. That raised hopes
that the slide in payouts had reached bottom.</LD>
<TE>   S&amp;P said the renewed decline in the pace of dividend increases in
March may have been partly attributable to an early Easter, which may
have delayed some board meetings into the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The 110 companies raising dividend payments in March were the
lowest for any March since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, 431 companies raised dividend payments, down
3.8% from the number in the first quarter of 2001 and down 25% from
the pace in the same period of 1999, S&amp;P said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of companies cutting or omitting dividends totaled 45
in the first quarter, up slightly from 44 a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P said it still expects that a turnaround in corporate earnings
later this year will make more companies willing to boost dividends.</TE>
<TE>   "How strongly they rise, however, will depend on whether
corporations begin moving away from the low-dividend-payout policies
they adopted several years ago in the midst of the last bull market,"
S&amp;P said.</TE>
<TE>   Dividends had fallen out of favor with companies and many
investors in the late-1990s. Many firms used excess cash to buy back
stock rather than pay shareholders in the form of dividends. If the
outlook for stock capital gains diminishes, however, more investors
may come to value receiving higher cash dividends, analysts say.</TE>

<HD>Options-Expense Bill Meets Opposition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill to force companies to treat employee stock options as an
expense faces opposition in House and Senate tax committees, and from
a countermeasure offered by a Senate committee chairman.</LD>
<LD>   House Ways and Means Chairman William M. Thomas, a Bakersfield
Republican who oversees tax legislation, opposes a bill sponsored by
Michigan Democrat Sen. Carl Levin and Arizona Republican Sen. John
McCain that would force firms to report options as corporate expenses
and deduct them from income. So does Thomas' counterpart in the
Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana.</LD>
<LD>   "He's inclined not to support the bill primarily because the bill,
as structured right now, goes too far in the direction of potentially
penalizing companies," Baucus spokesman Michael Siegel said. Thomas'
spokeswoman made a similar comment.</LD>
<TE>   A bill to promote wider distribution of stock options among
rank-and-file workers, which is being drafted by Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, also faces opposition. His
proposal would eliminate capital gains taxes on long-term holdings if
a company gives half its option grants to workers making $90,000 or
less.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Levin-McCain and Lieberman bills emerge as Congress takes
a closer look at stock option grants in the wake of the Enron Corp.
collapse. Levin said his bill aims to promote fuller, clearer
accounting; by not counting stock options as a current expense, Enron
cut its taxes and boosted profit.</TE>
<TE>   Expensing options is opposed by many companies, especially in the
tech sector. Analysts say the practice would reduce many companies'
reported earnings.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. and affiliate Asia Global Crossing Ltd. delayed
filing financial reports with regulators, citing investigations of
accounting at Global, the fiber-optic network operator that filed for
bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies missed an April 1 deadline for submitting their
annual report on sales, profit and other information of interest to
shareholders that publicly traded companies must file each year to
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen can't audit either set of books until the SEC and a panel
appointed by Global Crossing's board finish investigations into how
Global Crossing reported sales of capacity on its 27-nation
fiber-optic network, the filings said.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC, Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. lawmakers are
investigating allegations by a former employee that Global, which
owns 59% of Asia Global, overstated income. Chief Executive John
Legere has said those probes will help determine how the company
reports income.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing officials, who operate mainly from offices in
Madison, N.J., will begin publishing monthly reports of financial
operations as part of the bankruptcy protection process begun Jan.
28. The first report is due next week.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Requests Gateway Change Board</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's largest pension fund asked computer maker Gateway Inc.
to change the structure of its board of directors to make it more
responsive to shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System proposed that
Gateway declassify its board, meaning that all directors would be up
for election each year. Poway, Calif.-based Gateway, which opposes
the change, has a classified board, which means directors serve
staggered terms and only one-third of them are up for reelection in a
given year.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS, which owns more than 1.1 million Gateway shares, is
dissatisfied with the performance of the nation's fourth-largest
computer maker and believes the board's current structure makes it
difficult for shareholders to change board members.</LD>
<TE>   Gateway shareholders can decide whether to hold a vote on the
CalPERS proposal at a May 16 meeting in Sioux City, Iowa. If they
agree to a vote, they would then decide whether to declassify the
board at the 2003 shareholders meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway shares fell 23 cents to close at $6.30 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. will ask a judge to dismiss a suit filed by
company director Walter Hewlett, who alleges vote-buying in a planned
$19.4-billion buyout of Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Judge William Chandler III of Delaware Chancery Court told lawyers
that he will hear the company's arguments and Walter Hewlett's
counterclaims beginning at 9:30 a.m. Sunday in Wilmington, Del.</LD>
<LD>   Walter Hewlett, the only founding family member left on Palo
Alto-based Hewlett-Packard's board, stepped up his fight with Chief
Executive Carly Fiorina in a lawsuit filed last week. He claims
Hewlett-Packard coerced investor Deutsche Bank into changing its vote
on the Compaq deal, tipping the count in Fiorina's favor.</LD>
<TE>   The company's lawyers called the suit a "last-gasp attempt" to
block the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler also signed an order Tuesday allowing Walter Hewlett's
lawyers to issue subpoenas for documents related to Deutsche Bank's
voting on the merger and its business relationships with
Hewlett-Packard. The documents were to be supplied by April 11, in
anticipation of depositions being taken April 16, according to the
judge's order.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares were down 45 cents at $17.45 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T CEO Armstrong Gets $9.59 Million in Pay</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp. paid Chief Executive C. Michael Armstrong $9.59 million in
2001, almost three times his compensation a year earlier, as shares
of the biggest U.S. long-distance telephone company rose 35%.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong's salary, bonus and other compensation, excluding stock
options, rose from $3.28 million in 2000, according to AT&amp;T's annual
report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. His 2001
compensation included a $2.21-million bonus and $4 million in
restricted shares that don't vest fully until 2004. In 2000,
Armstrong received no restricted stock.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T agreed last year to sell its cable television business, the
nation's biggest, to Comcast Corp. for $72 billion. Armstrong, who
will leave to become chairman of Comcast when the transaction closes,
spent more than $100 billion to build the cable unit.</LD>
<TE>   The company will be left with a long-distance business that has
declining sales.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong, 63, also was granted options to buy 1.1 million shares,
potentially worth $7.64 million, according to the filing. Their
exercise prices, at $16.85 and $17.39, are above AT&amp;T's current share
price of $15.84.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based company's shares were down 54 cents at $15.30
on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>New President for American Airlines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Airlines' operations manager Gerard J. Arpey was named
president and chief operating officer of the carrier Tuesday, making
him a front-runner to eventually succeed Donald J. Carty as chief
executive of the world's largest airline.</LD>
<LD>   Arpey, 43, was American's executive vice president for operations.
He succeeds Carty, 55, who has been chairman, chief executive and
president of both the airline and AMR Corp. since 1998. Carty remains
president and Arpey an executive vice president of the holding
company, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   The chief operating officer's position at the airline had been
vacant.</LD>
<TE>   The recent retirement of AMR's vice chairman, Bob Baker, created
"an opportune moment" to elevate Arpey, a 20-year veteran of
American, Carty said. Arpey will continue to oversee most of the Fort
Worth-based airline, including its flight and maintenance operations,
airport customer service and the carrier's regional-jet unit American
Eagle.</TE>
<TE>   Arpey joined American in 1982 as a financial analyst after he
received a master's degree in business administration from the
University of Texas. He became American's chief financial officer in
1995, and executive vice president of operations in 2000.</TE>

Andersen with KPMG unraveled Tuesday after the Spanish unit of
Andersen reached a separate agreement to combine with Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen Worldwide and KPMG said in a joint statement that they
are still talking about combining some operations outside the United
States but added, "In view of the decisions by certain individual
firms to pursue different directions, it is clear that a deal
embracing all of the non-U.S. firms is not achievable."</LD>
<LD>   The Andersen partnership in Spain is the sixth of the 84
individual firms that make up the Andersen Worldwide confederation to
craft a business combination with a rival other than KPMG.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said repudiation by the Spanish partnership of the KPMG
agreement was significant because it was the first European firm to
ignore the deal and because of its dominant market position. It
audits 23 of Spain's top 25 companies.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, sources said the agreement is expected to pave the way
for Deloitte to pick up Andersen partnerships in much of Latin
America, which because of its historical ties, still has intricate
relationships with the business community in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows that Andersen Worldwide no longer has any pull with
its affiliated firms," said Jonathan Hamilton, editor of the Public
Accounting Report, a trade journal.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton said the defection of the important Spanish firm
underscored how Andersen has been crippled by liability from its work
for Enron Corp. and subsequent criminal indictment for its
destruction of documents sought in the federal probe of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the 18-member management board of Andersen Worldwide
met in London on Tuesday but failed to name a interim leader to
replace Joseph F. Berardino, the Andersen chief executive who
resigned last week.</TE>
<TE>   Berardino will remain with Andersen until a CEO is named.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen spokesman said Berardino's successor will fulfill a
legal and administrative role, overseeing the dismantling of the
worldwide confederation. The individual will not be a "global leader
in the chief executive sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Berardino stepped down last week so that former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul A. Volcker could launch a rescue plan for the
accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker's plan is dependent on getting the Justice Department to
dismiss or suspend its indictment. A trial in the criminal case is
scheduled to begin May 6.</TE>
<TE>   He also must reach a settlement agreement with the class-action
plaintiffs who have claims against Andersen for its Enron work.
Attorneys for Enron investors and employees are scheduled to file
revised consolidated lawsuits in the cases Monday.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG and other firms that make up the accounting industry's Big
Five have balked at acquiring all of Andersen, including its U.S.
partnership because of the legal and liability fallout from its Enron
work.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Andersen firms in Australia, Russia and New Zealand have
agreements to merge with Ernst &amp; Young. The offices in China and Hong
Kong plan to combine with PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   "We may eventually see a lot of firms join with KPMG, but they
could be mostly the smaller ones like Croatia which just are not that
important in terms of the size of their business," Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Bowman, editor of Bowman's Accounting Report, said each of
the overseas Andersen partnerships is looking at its own markets and
deciding how it can get the best deal.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen continues to suffer from the defection of major clients
as well as overseas affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   Cummins Inc. of Columbus, Ind., said Tuesday that it revoked its
recent appointment of Andersen and plans to use
PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost about 10% of its more than $4 billion in U.S.
business since December and is expected to lay off several thousand
of its 28,000 domestic employees next week.</TE>

<HD>Auditor Complained About Enron in 1999</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Documents released Tuesday show that an auditor with accounting firm
Andersen began complaining about Enron Corp.'s aggressive accounting
practices as early as 1999, but his warnings went unheeded and he was
reassigned last year after Enron executives complained about him.</LD>
<LD>   In a series of e-mails, Carl E. Bass, an Andersen auditor who
worked for the firm's Professional Standards Group, tried to raise
red flags about Enron's off-the-books partnerships and
special-purpose entities, including the Raptors and an entity set up
to offer video-on-demand with Blockbuster Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Bass worked for an internal unit that provided accounting advice
and guidance for other Andersen auditors.</LD>
<TE>   The documents, released by the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, may help the Justice Department in its criminal case
against Andersen for obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to show that Andersen shredded thousands of
Enron-related documents to cover up its own bad decisions, federal
prosecutors said in their indictment last month that "the Andersen
team handling the Enron audit directly contravened the accounting
methodology approved by Andersen's own specialists working in its
Professional Standards Group."</TE>
<TE>   In a series of e-mails, Bass expresses discomfort that Enron was
recognizing income on some transactions and using its own stock to
back certain derivative contracts.</TE>
<TE>   He explained some of the downside risks, some of which
subsequently unfolded.</TE>
<TE>   Enron officials complained about Bass to David Duncan, the
Andersen partner in charge of the Enron account, said Robert Giuffra,
Duncan's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen spokesman could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Retailers Urge U.S. to Cut Tariffs</HD>
<DH>Imports: Sellers of apparel and footwear say duties raise
their costs, forcing them to charge consumers more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BLAIR PETHEL</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. are among clothing retailers
who say their customers pay an excessive share of the $18.6 billion
the U.S. collects each year in import tariffs, and they want the
government to change that.</LD>
<LD>   The retailers say U.S. tariffs on imported apparel, footwear and
other household items--which can be more than 10 times the average
U.S. duty--raise their costs and hurt low-income consumers. That
claim is backed by a new study.</LD>
<LD>   Though U.S. duties on imports of steel and lumber are causing the
most trade friction recently, the study by the Progressive Policy
Institute concluded that almost half of all U.S. tariffs are
collected on two categories of imports: shoes and clothing.</LD>
<TE>   "If the president wants to give a real break to the American
consumer, [eliminating the tariffs] is the best way to do real,
meaningful tax reform," said Jonathan Gold of the International Mass
Retail Assn., which represents companies including Best Buy Co. and
Ames Department Stores Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Gold's group is among those lobbying the U.S. government to press
the issue at a new round of market-opening talks sponsored by the
World Trade Organization, which are scheduled to conclude by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Big retailers that cater to the lower- and middle-income market
import most of their goods, and the stores say the $8.7 billion in
annual U.S. tariffs on shoes and clothing keep prices higher.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Williams, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, said scrapping the tariffs
would be preferable to reducing the taxes and would benefit consumers
by helping the company cut prices.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule, a 2,100-page document that
spells out duties on imports, is intended to protect companies from
low-cost foreign competition.</TE>
<TE>   But since 1990, the U.S. has lost more than 700,000 textile jobs,
and most of the U.S. footwear industry has moved production overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Cass Johnson, director of international trade at the American
Textile Manufacturers Institute, said the industry is suffering
because U.S. barriers have declined while those abroad remain high.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Trade Representative's office declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Tech Profit Woes, Mideast Anxiety Weigh on Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Nasdaq falls to lowest close since March 1.
Oil shares rise along with crude prices. Bond yields are mixed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks fell Tuesday after analysts cut profit estimates for
technology leaders such as Microsoft, while oil and gold prices
soared amid escalating Middle East violence and talk of a new Arab
oil embargo.</LD>
<LD>   "To me it continues to show the nervousness in the market because
we are still susceptible to negative news; bull markets are not,"
said Michael Farr, president of money-management firm Farr, Miller &amp;
Washington. "The Middle East continues to be a dark cloud over the
market. The fear is of a widespread conflict."</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index fell 58.22 points, or 3.1%, to
1,804.40. It was the tech-laden Nasdaq's lowest close since March 1.</LD>
<TE>   Less tech-centric indexes fared better. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 48.99 points, or 0.5%, to 10,313.71. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index declined 9.78 points, or 0.9%, to 1,136.76.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners 3 to 2 on Nasdaq, and by a slim 17-15 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was light.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the selling was concentrated in a few large technology
names on worries about near-term earnings. Goldman Sachs trimmed
earnings estimates for software giant Microsoft and for two other big
tech names--IBM and Sun Microsystems. Microsoft slid $3.08 to $57.30,
Sun lost 58 cents to $8.94, and IBM gave up $1.91 to $100.95.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman said IBM appeared to have a "difficult" first quarter as
capital spending remains depressed.</TE>
<TE>   "The worries [about technology stocks] are that everything gets
pushed out another quarter," said Richard Sichel, chief investment
officer at Philadelphia Trust Co. "Investors are tired of it, and
they're nervous."</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the near-month crude contract
rose 83 cents to close at $27.71, after earlier rising as high as
$28.10, as market players braced for possible supply disruptions amid
escalating violence in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Mideast] conflict is a lingering concern because of a threat
of a cutoff in oil supplies," said Dan Peirce, senior strategist for
State Street Global Advisors. "While all indications are that the
economy is on a firm recovery path, higher oil prices definitely put
a crimp in the vigor of that recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of many oil companies rallied along with oil prices. The
S&amp;P index of oil and gas producers was one of the best performing
sectors in the S&amp;P 500 with a 1.6% rise. Exxon Mobil rose 55 cents to
$44.38 and independent producer Apache gained $1.23 to $59.09.</TE>
<TE>   Longer-term bond yields fell as surprisingly weak economic data
eased fears about Federal Reserve interest rate increases. New orders
for U.S. factory goods slipped 0.1% to a seasonally adjusted $323.8
billion in February. Wall Street economists expected a 1% pickup in
orders. But new orders for costly and long-lasting durable goods rose
1.8%, following January's 1.6% increase, implying the factory sector
is regaining strength.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.34%
from Monday's close of 5.43%. But yields on the shortest maturities
rose. The yield on the six-month T-bill rose to 2.12% from 2.10%.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * The Amex Gold Bugs index rose 2.3% earlier in the session as
gold prices climbed $2.70 to $305.90, but closed down 1% after a bout
of profit taking. A number of gold mining companies held gains,
though, such as Hecla Mining, up 31 cents, or 14%, to $2.55.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb fell $2.16 to $38.24 after it
said wholesalers' inventories of its drugs are too high, which will
curb their demand for those medicines this year and hurt the
company's future earnings. Most other major drug stocks were little
changed, however.</TE>
<TE>   * Best Buy, whose shares have surged 73% since Sept. 21, lost
$4.47 to $75.01. The top U.S. electronics retailer forecast profit
this quarter short of estimates.</TE>
<TE>   * Insurance stocks were among the market's bright spots. American
International Group gained $1.34 to $72.24, Progressive rose $2.58 to
$169.20 and Cigna jumped $2.51 to $104.54.</TE>

<HD>PeopleSoft Tumbles 33% on Sales Report, Leading Software
Sell-Off</HD>
<DH>Tech: Analyst's revised estimate sends Microsoft down as
well, as sector's near-term prospects dim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Software stocks bore the brunt of the selling in the technology
sector Tuesday as hopes dimmed for a significant turnaround in the
industry in the near term.</LD>
<LD>   PeopleSoft Inc. tumbled $12.21, or 33%, to $25.16 on Nasdaq after
the maker of computer programs for businesses said first-quarter
software sales and profit missed analysts' estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Internet software makers Commerce One Inc., Interwoven Inc. and
BroadVision Inc. also warned about quarterly results.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, brokerage Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. triggered a sell-off in
Microsoft Corp. after analyst Richard Sherlund cut his fiscal 2003
earnings estimate for the software giant to $1.95 a share from $2.05.
Its new fiscal year begins July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft slumped $3.08, or 5.1%, to $57.30 on Nasdaq, the lowest
closing price since Oct. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Sherlund kept Microsoft on the brokerage's "recommended" list but
said the U.S. economic recovery is "taking longer to gain traction in
the tech sector"--a warning that has been repeated by many analysts
in recent months, keeping a lid on most technology stocks after their
sharp gains in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Sherlund said his earnings-estimate cut for Microsoft was based on
expectations that the company would incur higher marketing, research
and development costs next year.</TE>
<TE>   He also cut his profit targets for Siebel Systems Inc. because the
environment may be "more challenging" than management anticipates, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Siebel, which makes software for e-business applications, dropped
$2.38 to $31.82 on Nasdaq. Sherlund trimmed his fiscal 2002 earnings
estimate to 50 cents a share from 57 cents and his fiscal 2003
estimate to 65 cents from 75 cents.</TE>
<TE>   PeopleSoft was the day's biggest software bomb. The firm, whose
programs are used to manage companies' accounting, human resources
and customer relations, said late Monday that first-quarter sales
were $130 million to $135 million, a decline of as much as 15% from a
year ago. In January, PeopleSoft forecast first-quarter software
license revenue of $160 million.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter profit from recurring operations was 14 cents a
share, based on a preliminary review, PeopleSoft said, without
defining recurring operations. The firm was expected to earn 15
cents, according to earnings-estimate tracker Thomson Financial/First
Call.</TE>
<TE>   PeopleSoft's shortfall caught investors by surprise because the
company managed to meet its forecasts every quarter last year, even
as rivals Oracle Corp., Siebel and SAP fell short amid the slump in
corporate spending on software.</TE>
<TE>   Customers are taking advantage of slow economic growth to
negotiate bigger discounts, hurting software makers' sales, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's cutting prices," said Bill Schaff, manager of the
$70-million Berger Information Technology Fund, which holds 8,000
PeopleSoft shares.</TE>
<TE>   In the Internet software sector, Commerce One said after regular
stock trading ended that first-quarter sales would fall below
forecasts because of sluggish tech spending, and Interwoven said its
first-quarter loss would be bigger than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Commerce One eased 10 cents to $1.48 in regular Nasdaq trading,
then fell to $1.38 in after-hours activity. Interwoven gained 20
cents to $5.57 on Nasdaq in regular trading, then slumped to $4.93 in
after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   BroadVision, which late Monday said first-quarter sales would fall
below estimates, sank 25 cents to $1.47 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>FTC, States Target Deceptive E-Mail and Internet Fraud</HD>
<DH>Probe: Commission takes action against online scams that
include a 'cancer cure,' a chain letter and CDs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the third crackdown targeting online scams this year, the Federal
Trade Commission announced Tuesday it had taken action against three
Web sites accused of making fraudulent offers over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The sites offered miracle cancer cures, a "can't fail" chain
letter scheme and compact discs that investigators said arrived late
or not at all. Charges also were brought in a fourth case involving
deceptive e-mail, but it was under seal in U.S. District Court and
details were not released.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the four actions announced Tuesday, FTC officials
said they were working with law enforcement agencies in six states
and Canada to investigate chain letters, pump-and-dump stock schemes
and other online scams. The director of the FTC's Northwest region,
Charles Harwood, said 650 warning letters were sent to people who had
been involved in chain letters promising monetary rewards.</LD>
<TE>   The court actions were taken against two Ohio residents--Linda
Lightfoot and Charles Childs--who allegedly used Web sites and junk
e-mail to promote a chain letter promising that a $41 investment
would bring participants $10,000 within a few months. The FTC asked a
federal court to force Lightfoot and Childs to send back to
participants all funds collected.</TE>
<TE>   CD distributor Sound City 2000 agreed to a settlement requiring it
to refund customers who did not receive what they ordered.</TE>
<TE>   The cancer cure site is registered to David L. Walker, who last
year was charged with fraud by Washington state. The FTC asked a
federal court to permanently shut down the site and force Walker to

<TE>   Speaking at a Seattle news conference, math teacher Peter Fulton
said he had bought Walker's products in an attempt to treat his
wife's inoperable, pancreatic cancer. Fulton said he was normally a
careful consumer but was desperate for a cure.</TE>
<TE>   "It said there was hope," Fulton said of the site. "When there is
hope for life, how can I say no to my wife."</TE>
<TE>   Fulton said he spent about $1,500 on the treatments, which
included "diet and strange solutions and an unusual machine that
blinked and buzzed." They had no effect and his wife died in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Best Buy, Circuit City Profits Surge on Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Best Buy Co. and Circuit City Group on Tuesday said fiscal
fourth-quarter profits surged on strong sales of DVD players,
camcorders and big-screen TVs, but both consumer electronics
retailers warned that results in the current quarter may be weaker
than expected.</LD>
<LD>   Best Buy shares dropped about 6% after the U.S. market leader said
earnings for the first quarter ending in May will probably fall at or
below the low end of Wall Street expectations because of weak sales.</LD>
<LD>   But shares of Circuit City, which ranks second to Best Buy, rose
more than 5% even though the company said it expects to report a loss
at its stores instead of the profit that some analysts were expecting
for the quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the Richmond, Va.-based retailer may further reverse
its market share loss to Best Buy as it revamps about half of its
more than 600 stores in a bid to sell more profitable digital
products.</TE>
<TE>   Best Buy said net income jumped 84% to $350 million, or $1.62 a
share, in the fourth quarter ended March 2 from $190 million, or 89
cents, a year earlier. The results were 1 cent higher than the
Thomson Financial/First Call consensus estimate and within the
company's earlier forecast.</TE>
<TE>   The Eden Prairie, Minn.-based company said it benefited from fewer
markdowns and robust sales of higher-margin digital products,
particularly in the December shopping season. Best Buy had said in
March its fourth-quarter sales rose 28% to $6.98 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Best Buy closed off $4.47, or 5.62%, at $75.01 on the New York
Stock Exchange, after earlier trading as low as $74.25.</TE>
<TE>   On the year Best Buy is up just over 1%, while Circuit City is
down nearly 36%.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City reported net income of $152.7 million, or 73 cents a
share, for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 28, up 51% from $101.2
million, or 49 cents, a year earlier and in line with analysts'
estimates and a previous forecast from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Results include a retained equity interest in auto retailer CarMax
Group, which posted a profit of 17 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City said sales in the quarter rose 7% to $3.39 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But for the current quarter, the company said it expects to post a
loss because of remodeling costs and advertising expenses. It said it
expects "small profits" in the second and third quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City climbed $1.03 to $19.15 on the NYSE. They earlier
rose as high as $19.25.</TE>

<HD>Fairchild Dornier Discloses Insolvency</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Fairchild Dornier, the world's No. 3 manufacturer of short-haul jets,
sought protection from creditors Tuesday after airlines, rocked by
the turbulent slipstream of Sept. 11, canceled new plane orders,
undoing forecasts of soaring sales.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S.-German company racked up debts of $670 million in pursuit
of a market it had expected would expand rapidly until the terrorist
strikes hit the air travel industry.</LD>
<LD>   Although Fairchild Dornier Managing Director Thomas Brandt told
journalists the company is continuing to look for a well-heeled
partner to deliver its new 70-seat 728JET next year, the warning
appeared to herald the company's eventual retreat from the troubled
ranks of regional jet producers.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts had been predicting further consolidation of what is now
only a $5-billion annual sales market dominated by Brazil's Empresa
Brasileira de Aeronautica, which commands 50% of the sector, and
Canada's Bombardier, with 40%.</TE>
<TE>   German law requires companies to disclose their insolvency when
income fails to match expectations and debt payments could be
defaulted. Although the company's prospects for the 728JET were
favorable before Sept. 11, advance sales for the short-haul jet have
slowed dramatically, as have those of competitors and producers of
long-haul aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Fairchild Dornier was founded in 1914 and is based in the Bavarian
town of Oberpfaffenhofen. It has manufactured corporate and private
jets for years, though it has only the 32-seat 328JET in production.</TE>
<TE>   The company is a joint venture of New York investment firm Clayton
Dubilier &amp; Rice Inc. and German insurance giant Allianz. The owners
acquired the plane manufacturer two years ago and predicted that
sales would soar from $635 million in fiscal 2000 to $5 billion by
2008 as regional U.S. carriers replaced their old turboprop planes
with more modern jetliners.</TE>
<TE>   "We are continuing to pursue a strategic partner and continuing
our discussions with financial institutions to pursue a
recapitalization," Chief Executive Lou Harrington said.</TE>
<TE>   The company had been in talks with Boeing Co. about collaborating
on the $1-billion 728JET development, for which Fairchild Dornier has
125 firm orders and more than 160 options. But the takeover
negotiations were broken off without success before the Easter
holiday, Germany's Handelsblatt daily reported Tuesday, ahead of the
insolvency declaration.</TE>
<TE>   Fairchild Dornier's three main creditors are German banks--HVB
Group, Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale and an Allianz
subsidiary--but Brandt said the company also was considering whether
to file for Chapter 11 protection from U.S. creditors. About 700 of
the company's 4,300 employees are assigned to a wing assembly plant
in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   The legally mandated notification of insolvency prompted German
media to declare the company's fate a major blow to the electoral
chances of Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, who is challenging
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for the nation's top post in Sept. 22
federal elections.</TE>

<HD>Barred Broker Khan Again Under Scrutiny in SEC Inquiry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regulators are investigating whether former stockbroker Rafi Khan,
who pleaded guilty to tax fraud in 1999 and agreed in 2001 to a
five-year banishment from the securities business, may have
improperly promoted stocks in which he had an interest.</LD>
<LD>   In filings in federal court in Los Angeles this week, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said it was examining Khan's
connections to four Southern California companies--GenesisIntermedia
Inc., Aura Systems Inc., EUniverse Inc. and Ontro Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC said Khan wrote promotional reports about the companies
for investors, and raised capital for at least three of the firms.
They compensated him by issuing stock or warrants to companies owned
by Khan's brother-in-law, Qaiser Imran, a wealthy Pakistani
businessman, the SEC filings said.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC said Imran's companies in Pakistan then sold shares of the
companies through a brokerage account of Khan's wife, Rubina Khan.</TE>
<TE>   One SEC filing said Khan may be using his wife's bank and
brokerage accounts "in an attempt to conceal his participation in
certain financing or stock purchase agreements" and "evade the
restrictions or disclosure requirements arising from" his previous
run-ins with securities regulators.</TE>
<TE>   If the allegations are proved to be true, it would mean Khan
continued to operate in violation of settlements of the earlier fraud
investigations. That potentially would subject him to large fines, a
permanent ban from the securities industry and possibly prosecution
for criminal contempt, according to the SEC and federal prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Khan, who lives in La Canada Flintridge, said Tuesday that he has
carefully obtained legal approval for everything he has done since
settling the previous cases.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Saeid Kashani, said that writing reports did not
constitute a return to the securities business. He also said Khan
disclosed in his reports that he may hold positions in the subject
stocks, and that Khan authorized the firms to pay Imran to cover
loans Imran had made to Khan.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC inquiry, which began Nov. 13, became public after the
agency asked a federal judge Monday to order Rubina Khan to provide
testimony about her bank and brokerage accounts. The request is
pending. Kashani said Rubina Khan agreed to answer written questions,
but was unable to under- go the stress of an in-person deposition
because she is on anti-seizure medication after surgery three years
ago for a brain tumor.</TE>
<TE>   Khan has been investigated in connection with a series of alleged
stock-promotion scams dating back to 1993, when he allegedly
orchestrated a fraudulent trading scheme that helped fuel spectacular
gains in the stock of Future Communications, which later collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   In settling a federal criminal investigation, he pleaded guilty to
tax fraud and also agreed to cooperate with federal investigators. In
April 2000, he consented to a permanent order barring him from
violating anti-fraud laws preventing market manipulation. He later
agreed to an SEC order barring him from associating for five years
with any broker or dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Kashani blamed much of Khan's woes on complaints by short sellers,
speculators who bet stocks will go down and who Kashani said have
resented Khan's positive reports on companies. Kashani said Khan
provided reports on small companies in need of capital to potential
investors--large institutions with their own research staffs.</TE>

<HD>Auditor Questions Golf Firms' Viability</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The independent auditor of National Golf Properties Inc. and American
Golf Corp., two Santa Monica-based companies that have agreed to
merge, raised doubts about the viability of both firms in light of
financial problems and a barrage of lawsuits, according to filings
with federal regulators. National Golf shares fell more than 20%.</LD>
<LD>   National Golf's annual report to the Securities and Exchange
Commission also provided details about the deteriorating financial
condition at the two sister companies founded by Los Angeles
businessman David G. Price. National Golf, a publicly traded real
estate investment trust, agreed to merge with American Golf, a
private company that manages nearly all of National Golf's
properties.</LD>
<LD>   PricewaterhouseCoopers, which serves as the auditor to both firms,
said American Golf's difficulty making rent payments to National Golf
and other problems "raise substantial doubt about [National Golf's]
ability to continue as a going concern." During 2001, National Golf
reported a loss of about $363,000, contrasted with net income of
$19.79 million in the previous year, the annual report said.</LD>
<TE>   The auditor also was concerned about the viability of American
Golf. At the end of 2001, American Golf reported current liabilities
that exceeded current assets by $149.5 million. American Golf also
reported a loss of $60.4 million for 2001, compared with a loss of
only $200,000 in the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   During the first three months of this year, American Golf was
$17.5 million behind in its rent payments to National Golf.</TE>
<TE>   "PricewaterhouseCoopers' concerns regarding our primary tenant
underscore why maintaining the status quo is not an attractive
solution," said Charles S. Paul, chairman of National Golf's
independent directors' committee and interim chief executive of the
company. "By joining National Golf and American Golf together, we can
create a unified, focused corporate structure to unlock the full
value of our combined property portfolio."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of National Golf fell $1.52 to $5.65 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Homestore Lost $1.5 Billion in 2001, SEC Filing Discloses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com Inc. lost about $1.5 billion in 2001, reflecting the
write-down of assets and expenses related to a restructuring,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which manages the biggest home-listing Web site, said
it had a loss of $146 million in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   No other information on results was disclosed in the filing.</LD>
<TE>   The Westlake Village-based company expects to provide more details
on its 2001 performance by the end of the week, said spokeswoman
DeLise Keim.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore.com's shares are down 94% since mid-July as the company
investigates its accounting practices after uncovering advertising
sales that should have been accounted for as barter transactions.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry led to the ouster of Stuart Wolff as chairman and
chief executive in January.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the company restated results for 2000 to a loss of
$146.1 million, or $1.83 a share, from the previously reported loss
of $115.2 million, or $1.44.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue was cut to $181.3 million from $230 million.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore.com said in November that it expected to take a charge
of $650 million to $950 million in the fourth quarter to reflect the
declining value of acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore.com shares fell 7 cents to $2.25 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>ImClone Systems Inc.'s fourth-quarter loss narrowed because of
payments on the biotechnology company's cancer drug Erbitux from

<LD>   The loss narrowed to $30.5million, or 42 cents a share, from
$33.7million, or 52 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue rose to $2.31 million from $153,000, mostly because of

<LD>McDonald's Corp. said it is conducting its first U.S. market test of
imported beef.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald's is responding to a decline in the slaughter of beef and
dairy cows used for the production of hamburger meat, the company
said. An undisclosed amount of beef purchased from Australia and New
Zealand is used in McDonald's restaurants in the Southeast.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's rose 25 cents to $27.50

<DL></DL>
<LD>Orders for U.S. factory goods eased slightly in February, a sign the
economy may be climbing out of recession at a less robust pace than
some had thought.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department said the value of new manufactured-goods
orders eased 0.1% to a seasonally adjusted $323.8billion--contrary to
Wall Street economists' expectations of a 1% pickup in orders.</LD>
<LD>   The inventory-to-shipments ratio, which measures the amount of
time it would take to deplete supplies at the current pace of
shipments, crept up to 1.37 months' worth from 1.34 in January.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, the consulting firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas said
layoff announcements by U.S. companies fell 20% in March to 102,315,
still above the average for the 1991-92 recession.</TE>

<LD>Several analysts lowered Tyco International Ltd.'s fiscal
second-quarter profit forecasts because of weaker-than-expected
electronics markets and the finance unit's exposure to Argentina.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts from Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Credit Suisse First Boston
Group, UBS Warburg and Lehman Bros. reduced their forecasts for the
quarter ended March 31 for the maker of electronic connectors.</LD>
<LD>   The company's CIT finance unit's exposure to Argentina's currency
devaluation lowered profit by as much as 4 cents a share, Tyco said.
That would make earnings 61 cents to 65 cents.</LD>

<LD>Leading U.S. tax preparer H&amp;R Block Inc. said its tax business
revenue for the season through March 15 was up 12.1% from a year ago
to $1.4 billion, boding well for its earnings, while customers also
are seeing more money in their pockets.</LD>
<LD>   Total clients served increased 3.6% to 13.2 million, and the
average fee per client served rose 9.1% to $117.03, the Kansas City,
Mo.-based company said.</LD>
<LD>   "The average refund is running in excess of $2,000; that is up
20%," said Chief Executive Mark Ernst.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers are paying far less in capital gains taxes because of
2001's slumping markets, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it's on track to meet 2002 earnings
guidance. Ernst cautioned, however, that the remaining weeks before
the April 15 tax filing deadline are critical and unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares closed down 22 cents at $42.85 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Dealing a preliminary victory to the nation's wineries and breweries,
a federal judge in Virginia has struck down a state law barring its
residents from ordering wine and beer from out of state delivered to
their homes.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams of the Eastern District of
Virginia ruled Friday that the state law was unconstitutional because
it unfairly discriminated in favor of in-state wineries, which can
ship wine legally to state residents.</LD>
<LD>   Out-of-state wineries, he said, should have a similar opportunity
to reach customers without going through wholesalers and retailers.</LD>
<TE>   California wineries and wine e-commerce sites can't yet begin
filling Virginia orders. The state of Virginia has indicated that it
will appeal the decision, and Judge Williams has issued a stay of his
order pending that appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The wine industry is hoping that Williams' decision, which is in
conflict with the decision of other state courts, will prompt the
Supreme Court to take up the issue of direct shipping of wine and
beer.</TE>

<HD>Quest Diagnostics to Acquire Unilab for $900 Million</HD>
<DH>Deals: The merger, the medical laboratory giant's third in
six months, will boost its share of the California market to 12%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quest Diagnostics Inc., the nation's largest medical laboratory
company, Tuesday agreed to buy California market leader Unilab Corp.
for $900 million in cash and stock.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is the latest sign of consolidation in the fragmented
$35-billion medical lab test business. It will boost Quest's share of
the California market to 12% and create a company twice the size of
its closest rival, Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings.</LD>
<LD>   David Lewis, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners in San
Francisco, said mergers are giving laboratory companies greater
bargaining power with health insurers. And that is resulting in
higher prices for medical tests.</LD>
<TE>   Quest said improved pricing and reimbursement contributed to a
6.6% increase in average revenue per test in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But Lewis said it won't be easy for Quest to raise prices in
California, where managed-care companies control 48% of the state's
health insurance business. Managed-care firms account for 35% to 40%
of Unilab's test volume but only 10% to 15% of its revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Unilab Chief Executive Bob Whalen said in a conference call with
analysts Tuesday that the merged company will become less dependent
on managed care as HMO enrollment declines. It fell below 50% in
California in 2001 for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The Unilab acquisition is the third for Quest in six months. Its
$500-million purchase of American Medical Laboratories, a company
also coveted by Unilab, closed Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Unilab's failure to snag American Medical in the rapidly
consolidating industry led to its deal with Quest, Whalen said. "We
looked at going it alone and our options inside the state and outside
the state ... we had an interest in AMI," said Whalen. "When a
company like that goes off the market, it limits your options."</TE>
<TE>   Medical laboratory companies offer more than 1,000 tests used to
diagnose and treat disease. Routine tests include blood
cholesterol-level tests, urinalysis and employment-related drug
tests. The industry is benefiting from an aging population and
development of sophisticated genetics tests.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Freeman, chairman and chief executive of Teterboro,
N.J.-based Quest, said the company expects to sustain 30% annual
earnings-per-share growth this year and in 2003, despite the mergers.
But the company said it probably will take on $1 billion in
additional debt as a result of the Unilab and AMI deals.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman told analysts that Quest expects to save $30 million by
2004 as a result of the Unilab deal. A portion of the savings will
result from consolidating lab operations in California. Unilab and
Quest each operate three full-service laboratories in the state.
Quest said it had not worked out details of the consolidation, which
would be led by Whalen.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman said positions would be cut, but normal attrition should
account for a portion of the reductions. Quest's annual turnover in
its Western operations is 10%, said spokesman Gary Samuels.</TE>
<TE>   Unilab shareholders can elect to receive $26.50 in cash or the
equivalent amount in stock or a combination of cash and stock. Kelso
&amp; Co., Unilab's largest shareholder, has agreed to tender its 42%
stake. The companies would not disclose if Kelso wants cash or stock.</TE>
<TE>   The offer represents a 6% premium over Unilab's closing price
Monday and comes 10 months after Unilab went public at $16 a share in
June.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Unilab and Quest declined to comment Tuesday on
any discussions they had before Unilab's public offering. Whalen
defended the modest premium offered by Quest as good for
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Whalen's role with Quest beyond managing the consolidation was
unclear Tuesday. Samuels said Whalen does not have a new title and
will not be joining the Quest board.</TE>
<TE>   Unilab is based in Tarzana and employs 4,000 people, mostly in
California. It had a loss of $2.9 million, including one-time
charges, on revenue of $390 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   Quest had income of $162.3 million on revenue of $3.63 billion.
Its shares fell $3.35 to $79.44 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Unilab shares rose $1.13 to $26.13 on Nasdaq. Its shares have
surged in recent weeks from as low as $18.14 in March.</TE>
<TE>   Samuels said Quest knew of no reason for the run-up. A spokesman

<HD>Tenet's Profit Exceeds Latest Upbeat Forecast</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet HealthCare Corp., the No. 2 U.S. hospital operator, said fiscal
third-quarter profit surged 41% to $288 million, or 86 cents a share,
beating expectations, on rising admissions and higher revenue per
patient.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Barbara-based company had said last month that it
expected to "comfortably exceed" analysts' average estimate of
81cents. Analysts then revised their forecast to 82 cents, according
to Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet said it expected fiscal 2002 earnings of $3.20 a share and
fourth-quarter profit of at least 90 cents, compared with analysts'
expectations of $3.13 and 87cents. It earned $2.30 for fiscal 2001
and 68 cents in that year's fourth quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue rose 15% to $3.48 billion in the third quarter. Analysts
said Tenet would have tougher comparisons for revenue growth ahead
because Medicare increased reimbursement levels in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tenet, which have gained 54% in the last year, rose 89
cents, or 1.3%, to $68.25, after touching a record $68.60 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Watson Reaches Pact to Sell Generic BuSpar</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. reached a settlement with Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. that would allow Watson to continue selling a generic
version of Bristol-Myers' lucrative anti-anxiety drug BuSpar.</LD>
<LD>   Corona-based Watson said it would receive a $32-million payment
from Bristol-Myers, as well as a nonexclusive license to sell the
drug under Bristol-Myers' patent.</LD>
<LD>   Last year Watson and Mylan Laboratories Inc. won a four-month
legal battle that allowed them to begin selling generic versions of
BuSpar, but both companies claimed Bristol-Myers unfairly delayed the
introduction of copycats. Watson filed an antitrust lawsuit against
Bristol-Myers in March of last year.</LD>

<HD>Two Men Plead Guilty in Ponzi Scheme</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two California men who raised $152 million in a Ponzi scheme and then
became victims themselves in an unrelated banknote scam face prison
after pleading guilty to criminal charges, federal prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Ernest F. Cossey faces 57 to 71 months in prison after pleading
guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and one count
of filing a false tax return, said the office of the U.S. attorney
for the Southern District of California in San Diego. Gary Williams
faces 18 to 24 months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of
preparing a false tax return for Cossey.</LD>
<LD>   Cossey and Williams told investors that their money would be
invested in distressed real estate, prosecutors said. But the men
used more than $28 million to buy racehorses and invest in a "prime
bank" scheme that turned out to be a bogus investment, the Securities
and Exchange Commission said.</LD>

<HD>Auto Sales Continue to Hold Up</HD>
<DH>U.S. car makers report strong consumer demand even with
Ford's persistent problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a poor showing by troubled Ford Motor Co., the auto industry
Tuesday reported strong sales for March and the first quarter of
2002--slightly below last year's pace but still in near-record
territory.</LD>
<LD>   Ford reported an 11.7% drop in March sales compared with the year
before, and the industry overall was down 1.6% for the month.</LD>
<LD>   A cutthroat discounting war led by General Motors Corp. has helped
prop up the domestic car makers' sales. But few importers are
following, and their strong sales are further evidence of an economic
recovery, analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   Industry analysts also point to rising U.S. employment, consumer
spending and consumer confidence levels as signs that a broad-based
economic rebound is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Most are expecting that to translate into new-car and light-truck
sales for the year in the range of 16.3 million to 16.7 million
units.</TE>
<TE>   That would be enough to make this the fourth- or fifth-best year
on record. Auto makers sold 17.1 million cars and light trucks in the
U.S. last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything north of 16 million is a very solid sales year," said
automotive analyst Bret Hoselton of Cleveland-based McDonald
Investments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been amazing," said Fritz Hitchcock, president of Hitchcock
Automotive resources, which owns a chain of six Southern California
new-car dealerships. "But retail [passenger vehicle] sales in the
first quarter have been stupefyingly good."</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock, who owns Toyota, Volkswagen, BMW and Ford dealerships,
said volume at his Toyota franchises is up 15% and sales of the other
import brands are even with last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The only disappointment is at Ford, which has problems of its
own," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's problems are linked to a series of quality glitches that
have hurt its image with consumers and to a steep drop-off in fleet
business as sales to rental car companies withered after the Sept.
11-induced tourism and travel drought.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of new cars and trucks for the first quarter are off 3.3%
from a year ago. But as with Ford, fleet sales are down steeply at
most companies.</TE>
<TE>   "When you factor that out, retail sales of cars and trucks are
actually pretty strong," said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy.
"Conditions are about as favorable as they have ever been in the
post-war period," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial fleet sales were down as major customers continued
practicing financial restraint while waiting for the economy to
recover, said GM economist Paul Ballew.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said its fleet sales were off 21% for March; retail sales
were down just 8%. Ford's market share dropped to 21.6% for March,
down from 24.1% a year earlier. For the first quarter, Ford claimed a
21% share of the U.S. passenger vehicle market, down from 22.9%.</TE>
<TE>   GM, with a 1.7% overall dip in sales for March, reported a 29%
drop in fleet sales versus a 6% gain in retail sales, and the
Chrysler Group unit of German-American car maker DaimlerChrysler said
retail sales were flat while plunging fleet activity dragged down
total sales for the month by 4%.</TE>
<TE>   GM and Chrysler both beat their own and industry analysts'
estimates of March sales. Ford--which had double-digit declines in
January and February as well--did worse than expected.</TE>
<TE>   For the first quarter, GM's market share dipped slightly to 28.5%
from 28.7% a year earlier and Chrysler Group's dropped to 15% from
15.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Light trucks, including pickups, minivans and sport utility
vehicles, continued to account for more than half of all sales with a
51.1% share for March and a 51.9% share for the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its other woes, Ford recaptured the pickup truck sales
crown for March as its F-series trucks squeaked past GM's Silverado
line.</TE>
<TE>   Among import brands, Toyota Motor Sales USA posted a 4.1% sales
hike for March. The largest of the importers, Toyota had a 10.4%
market share for the quarter and is the only import brand to hit the
double-digit mark in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's Lexus brand led the luxury market with a 1.4% share,
followed by Mercedes-Benz at 1.3%, Acura unit at 1%, Cadillac at 1%
and Lincoln at 0.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Including its Acura unit, American Honda Motor Co. posted a 2.1%
sales gain for March and a 7% market share for the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan North America, the No. 3 import brand, saw sales jump 14.2%
in March. Its market share for the first quarter rose to 4.8% from
4.2%. Honda brand sales alone were up 1.9% for March and Acura sales
rose 3.3%.</TE>
<TE>   March sales at Volkswagen of America, including its Audi and VW
units, were up 6.7% and the company's share of the first-quarter
market rose to 2.4% from the year-earlier 2.3%.</TE>
<TE>   GM economist Ballew said domestic car makers' discount programs,
such as GM's $2,002 rebates on most models and Ford's $2,500
cash-back plans, have kept sales running 4% above the 16-million
annual pace that the general economy could support unaided.</TE>
<TE>   GM, the only domestic car maker to post a profit last year and the
only one expected to do it this year, is keeping the pressure on.</TE>
<TE>   The company said Tuesday that it will extend its rebate and
discount interest program through April 30.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, whose program expires April 8 and whose cash reserves are
dwindling, said it will wait a few days before announcing whether it
will follow GM's lead.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler, which is offering up to $2,500 rebates on many vehicles,
is expected to keep pace with GM.</TE>

<HD>FCC Told to Fix Station Rule</HD>
<DH>Broadcasting: U.S. appeals court says TV ownership limit is
arbitrary and orders the agency to consider other types of media when
evaluating a market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr. and SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday ordered federal regulators to justify
a long-standing rule barring media companies from owning more than
one TV station in about half of the nation's television markets.</LD>
<LD>   The court said the Federal Communications Commission's TV
ownership restriction is arbitrary because it does not include
newspapers, cable TV systems and radio stations when measuring
diversity, competition and the number of "voices" available to an
audience.</LD>
<LD>   The court ordered the agency to review its duopoly rule, which
allows a company to own two stations in a small or mid-size market.
The rule was adopted in 1964 when there were only 649 television
stations in the U.S., compared with nearly 1,700 outlets today in 283
television markets.</LD>
<TE>   "We hold that the definition of 'voices' in the local ownership
rule is arbitrary and capricious," the three-judge panel wrote.</TE>
<TE>   FCC spokesman David Fiske said the agency was studying the court's
decision and had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's ruling marked the fourth time in 18 months that federal
judges have overturned or set aside FCC regulations limiting media
ownership.</TE>
<TE>   And for more than a year, FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell has
promised to overhaul its media ownership rules to take into account
new technologies, including the Internet and cable TV, that have
changed the media industry.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 19, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington ordered the
agency to revise a rule banning a company from owning TV stations
that reach more than 35% of all U.S. television households. The
appeals panel also overturned the FCC's prohibition on owning a cable
TV system and a broadcast station in the same market. Last year, a
lower court also ruled that preventing cable companies from reaching
more than 30% of the nation's households is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Acquisition-minded media giants such as News Corp. and Viacom
Corp. have been pushing Washington to change ownership rules so they
can expand their empires.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups and some lawmakers, however, have risen up against
the prospect of further media consolidation, arguing that this will
put greater control over news, information and entertainment into the
hands of just a few giants.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's ruling could be particularly beneficial to small
broadcasters that have struggled to survive in a business dominated
by major networks and a few large station groups. Operating two TV
stations in one market is usually more profitable than owning one
because the owner can consolidate sales, news and engineering staffs.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, Congress relaxed ownership rules, allowing
broadcasters to own two outlets in the nation's largest markets.
Since then, Fox network parent News Corp., and CBS parent Viacom have
aggressively pursued duopoly station ownership. Today, News Corp.
owns two TV stations in seven cities, and Viacom owns two stations in
six cities.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC rule lets a company own two stations in a single market
when at least eight other independently owned stations are
broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, there are an estimated 140 small and mid-size markets
where TV duopolies are prohibited, including cities as large as
Baltimore and Pittsburgh that do not pass the so-called eight-voice
test.</TE>
<TE>   Sinclair Broadcasting challenged the FCC's duopoly rule as
unconstitutional and arbitrary. The appeals court on Tuesday rejected
the constitutional challenge, but the three-judge panel was troubled
by how the FCC defined independent voices in a market.</TE>
<TE>   Sinclair is trying to acquire stations in Sacramento and six other
markets where it already owns a television station, said spokesman
Mark Hyman.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of clients that want to acquire a second station"
in a market, said Richard E. Wiley, a veteran Washington
communications lawyer whose firm has represented media giant AOL Time
Warner Inc., among others.</TE>
<TE>   "This would allow some small-market stations to combine and
compete more effectively," said Tony Vinciquerra, president of Fox
Television Network.</TE>
<TE>   Small broadcasters have been hard hit by the changing economics of
television in which many viewers have shifted to cable and their
costs have doubled because of a shift to state-of-the-art digital
technologies.</TE>
<TE>   The major networks also have asked affiliate stations to chip in
to finance expensive sports programming, and the networks have
eliminated some fees for airing their schedules that for some small
broadcasters have accounted for 80% of their revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Some broadcasters predicted Tuesday that the FCC, led by
free-market-leaning Powell, would follow the court's hints to relax
the duopoly rule by counting other media outlets besides TV in a
market.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll change the rule substantially," said Paxson
Communications Corp. Chairman Lowell Paxson. "It will benefit the
smaller broadcasters in the smaller markets."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say it could take up to a year for the FCC to revise its
duopoly rule to satisfy the appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sinclair Broadcasting said the FCC "plucked the number
eight out of thin air," the appeals panel did not take issue with the
FCC's limit but insisted that the agency justify the number or change
it to a more supportable figure.</TE>
<TE>   In a partial dissent, Circuit Judge David Sentelle said he
concurred with the court's criticism that the FCC failed to justify
its duopoly rule, but he said he would have preferred to invalidate
the entire regulation.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar Stock Plummets 37%</HD>
<DH>Revenue: Shareholders react after disclosure that nearly
$80 million in sales reported in 2001 was not collected in cash.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares in Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. plunged to a three-year
low Tuesday after the company disclosed it had reported almost $80
million in revenue last year that it had not collected in cash.</LD>
<LD>   Gemstar recorded revenue that came from advertising swaps and
licensing fees the company hopes to collect through a lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The money accounted for less than 6% of Gemstar's total revenue in
2001, most of which came from TV Guide magazine and related ventures.
Nevertheless, the disclosures in Gemstar's annual report, which the
company filed Monday after the markets closed, caused at least two
analysts to drop their recommendations to buy Gemstar stock.</LD>
<TE>   "The accounting items ... raise questions about the company's
revenue growth, revenue quality and revenue risk," said CIBC World
Markets analyst John Corcoran. "These items do relate to the
company's primary catalyst, they do relate to its fastest-growing and
highest-margin business segments."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Gemstar followed the rules. But the pounding the
Pasadena-based company took on Wall Street reflects investors'
heightened sensitivity to accounting issues in the wake of the
collapse of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Yuen, Gemstar's chief executive, told analysts in a
conference call the company was simply responding to the Securities
and Exchange Commission's call for more detailed disclosures from all
companies. The company will collect much of the revenue it reported,
Yuen predicted, once its legal dispute with set-top box maker
Scientific-Atlanta Inc. is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar shares closed at $9.01 on Nasdaq in heavy trading, down
37% from Monday's close of $14.36. Shares fell as low as $8.88 on
Tuesday. Since August 2000, the company's stock has lost 90% of its
value.</TE>
<TE>   Yuen devoted the conference call to defending three disclosures in
Gemstar's annual report.</TE>
<TE>   First, the company said it had not collected almost $59 million of
the $327 million in licensing revenue reported in 2001, and $107.6
million of the $767 million in licensing revenue reported since July
1999. Instead, the amounts represent license payments that Gemstar
claims it is owed by Scientific-Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Scientific-Atlanta had a license to distribute set-top boxes with
Gemstar's electronic program guide, but that license expired in July
1999. Gemstar has accused Scientific-Atlanta of continuing to
distribute set-top boxes with Gemstar's software or similar
technology that violates Gemstar's patents.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the company revealed that $20 million of the $101 million
in interactive advertising revenue it reported last year came in the
form of technology, not cash. The company bought technology from
Fantasysports.com for nearly $21million, Yuen said, but Fantasysports
paid back $20 million of that amount to buy advertising on Gemstar's
electronic program guides.</TE>
<TE>   A third issue noted by Salomon Smith Barney analyst Niraj Gupta
was the disclosure that a significant amount of the interactive
advertising fees came from companies that were licensees, vendors or
strategic partners of Gemstar. Gupta downgraded his Gemstar rating
from "buy" to "neutral."</TE>
<TE>   Yuen said the sale of advertisements on the program guide grew
significantly, even excluding Fantasysports.</TE>
<TE>   "The viability of this new media is absolutely not in question,"
he said, adding that the company was "continuing to sign very
blue-chip advertisers."</TE>
<TE>   Corcoran said the market reacted strongly because licensing fees
and advertising sales on the program guide are critical to Gemstar's
future.</TE>
<TE>   "Having a clean audit letter from your accountant does not mean
you have the blessing from your shareholders," Corcoran said. "The
Street didn't bless it. Shareholders didn't bless it, and they
reacted today."</TE>

<HD>Weight-Loss Programs Tax-Deductible</HD>
<DH>Finances: IRS rules that people diagnosed as obese can
claim fees as medical expenses if they meet income standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People diagnosed as obese will be able to claim a tax deduction for
the cost of weight-loss programs associated with treating the
disease, the Internal Revenue Service ruled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling was welcomed by obesity experts. But tax experts said
those seeking to use the deduction still will have to meet the income
standards for claiming a medical deduction--meaning that not all
taxpayers being treated for obesity will be able to qualify for the
break.</LD>
<LD>   Under the ruling, enrollment and monthly membership fees in
weight-loss programs are deductible as medical expenses when the
programs are being used to treat obesity. In the past, the IRS
allowed deductions for weight-loss treatments only when the patient's
weight was causing some other ailment, such as hypertension or
diabetes. Now the agency is recognizing obesity as a specific
ailment.</LD>
<TE>   "This is fantastic, important and significant," said Barbara
Corkey, director of obesity research at Boston University. "It's time
we stopped treating people with this problem like they've been bad,
and start treating obesity for the medical condition that it is."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling comes four months after the U.S. surgeon general called
obesity a national epidemic, affecting roughly 35% of adults and 14%
of children. Because most people assume that obesity is caused by
overeating--a behavioral rather than a medical problem--health
insurance and tax benefits available to those with other medical
conditions were denied to the obese, Corkey said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the IRS ruling, a taxpayer who has been diagnosed with
obesity can deduct the cost of "the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
treatment or prevention" of the disease. That clearly covers formal
weight-loss programs such as Weight Watchers. It is "not specified"
whether it also would cover gym memberships and exercise equipment,
IRS officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a doctor's diagnosis is particularly important because the
ruling doesn't allow taxpayers to deduct weight-loss treatments that
are for cosmetic reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We have people who have medical problems all the time," said
Michael Thurmond, whose Six-Week Body Makeover program costs $975 and
includes follow-up visits.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling also excludes tax deductions for the purchase of
diet-related food. The IRS reasons that people have to buy food
whether or not they're trying to lose weight.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers won't need to provide proof of diagnosis or details
about the weight-loss program when filing returns. But they should
keep these documents in case they're audited, IRS officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Although welcome, the ruling probably will not result in huge tax
savings, accountants say. That's mainly because medical expenses are
deductible only after they exceed 7.5% of a taxpayer's adjusted gross
income--which is income after such deductions as 401(k) and
individual retirement account contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "The 7.5% threshold is a big hurdle, which causes very few people
to qualify," said Phil Holthouse, partner in the Los Angeles tax
accounting firm of Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van Trigt.</TE>
<TE>   Seriously overweight individuals often develop other health
problems. A recent study found that obesity is associated with a 36%
increase in health-related spending and a 77% increase in the need
for medications.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of weight-loss treatments may be added to other medical
expenses that aren't reimbursed to determine whether a taxpayer's
expenses exceed the deduction threshold in any given year.</TE>

<HD>Surging Crude Oil Prices Could Dampen Recovery</HD>
<DH>News analysis: The Mideast conflict and the possibility of
an Iraqi embargo could put the U.S. economy at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN, NANCY RIVERA BROOKS and JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rising oil prices--which one forecaster said could soon hit $30 a
barrel--threaten the fledgling economic recovery by adding unexpected
costs to consumers as well as to manufacturing, transportation and
other business sectors, analysts said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Oil prices are rising sharply because of fears that the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict will boil over to cause violent unrest
throughout the Middle East. A major factor contributing to
nervousness is that Iraq is trying to rally Arab oil producers to
embargo the United States and other supporters of Israel, in an echo
of 1973 when the price of oil quadrupled, throwing the world economy
into chaotic recession.</LD>
<LD>   There is no evidence that Iraq's call for embargo is succeeding,
said Joseph Stanislaw, president of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates. Indeed, Iraq has increased its own production by 500,000
barrels a day in response to greater demand for its particular grade
of crude oil, Stanislaw said.</LD>
<TE>   Also, Middle Eastern oil producing nations face high unemployment
and other economic woes, making oil revenue more imperative for them
today than 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But fear that Iraq and Iran could persuade other members of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut their
output, coupled with apprehension that violence could spread in the
Middle East, is driving oil traders in New York and London to boost
prices to six-month highs.</TE>
<TE>   Oil futures for May delivery closed Tuesday at $27.71 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 3% on the day. The price has
risen about $10 a barrel, or 55%, in the last three months. Gasoline
prices have risen a comparable amount in California and most other
parts of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "The price could go over $30 a barrel by the weekend," said Philip
Verleger, a Newport Beach-based oil economist and senior fellow of
the Council on Foreign Relations. Producers in the Persian Gulf,
including the United Arab Emirates, are angry that the Bush
administration has not stepped in to restrain the Israeli army's
incursion to Palestinian cities in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "A cutback of production would be their way of sending [President]
Bush a message," Verleger said. Saudi Arabia, the area's largest oil
producer, could not easily increase production to offset cuts
elsewhere in such a politically charged atmosphere, he said.</TE>
<TE>   No cuts appear to have been made so far. In March, daily output
from the 11 members of OPEC rose to more than 25 million barrels a
day, about 35% of total world production.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices had risen even before the crisis in Israel and the West
Bank since OPEC had managed to restrain its production to support a
price level of approximately $25 a barrel.</TE>
<TE>   This new surge in price has come as a surprise to economists.
Wells Fargo calculated earlier this year that if oil remained at $18
to $20 a barrel for the year, it would add about 0.5 percentage
points to economic growth. That upbeat forecast has been tossed out,
but Wells Fargo chief economist Sung Won Sohn still expects prices to
decline from their present heights if Middle East tensions calm down.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping that supply and demand will take over and oil will
settle down at about $22 a barrel," Sohn said.</TE>
<TE>   The latest price run-up "will affect consumers because it will
take real purchasing power out of their pockets," said John Felmy,
chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute. A slump in
energy prices last fall "allowed consumers to spend billions of
dollars on things other than energy," reducing the severity of the
economic downturn, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The jump in energy prices couldn't come at a worse time for the
airline industry, which already is struggling to rebound from the
recession and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Indeed, Continental
Airlines said Monday that it could be "challenging" to turn a profit
in the current quarter largely because of energy prices. The
wholesale price of jet fuel has soared 40% in the last three months,
reported John Armbrust, whose Armbrust Aviation Group covers the jet
fuel industry.</TE>
<TE>   United Parcel Service and Fed Ex Corp., two huge users of jet fuel
and gasoline for their daily delivery operations, have a surcharge
for fuel prices so they can pass along the higher fuel prices to
customers. As for air fares, "I expect the airlines to try and get
money from any source possible as long as the flying public will let
them," Armbrust said.</TE>
<TE>   Higher energy prices are clouding the stronger-than-expected
recovery that manufacturers have enjoyed during the last two months,
said Norbert J. Ore, an Atlanta businessman with the Institute for
Supply Management, which produces a closely watched monthly index of
manufacturing activity.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of things to watch, energy is one of my biggest concerns
right now," said Ore, who is a purchasing executive for
Georgia-Pacific Corp., which buys close to $1billion a year of
petroleum products for its manufacturing processes. "We get these
price spurts and it functions much like a tax increase because it
pulls a lot of money out of the economy."</TE>
<TE>   The main question businesspeople are asking now is whether today's
high prices will hold for a long time. If there were attempts to cut
production and embargo the U.S. and other markets, as Iraq is
proposing, other suppliers such as Russia, Mexico and Venezuela could
deliver a few million barrels a day in increased production to the
world, Stanislaw of Cambridge Energy explained. That would not be a
great deal compared to the Persian Gulf's output, which amounts to
21% of the world's demand and 24% of U.S. imports.</TE>
<TE>   Yet embargos and OPEC cutbacks would only occur if Middle East
tensions rose dramatically. "Saudi Arabia and other states would
think a million times before they would embargo the United States,"
Stanislaw said. The first embargo in 1973 caused the U.S. and other
industrial countries to increase their discovery and production of
alternative sources of oil and to make their own economies less
energy dependent.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology exists today to really shift our energy sources,"
Stanislaw said, referring to advances in fuel cells for automobiles
and other pending technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, although energy prices are up, "we're still in better
shape than we were a year ago at this time," Felmy said. Oil,
gasoline and natural gas prices were higher, inventories were lower
and California was suffering through electricity blackouts, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sohn also pointed out that the U.S. economy was about eight times
more sensitive to energy price volatility in 1973, during the first
Arab oil embargo.</TE>

<HD>New Angle in Fight Against Hiring Illegal Immigrants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Poultry giant Tyson Foods Inc. was sued Tuesday under federal
racketeering laws, becoming the latest and largest target in an
attempt to punish employers of illegal immigrant workers.</LD>
<LD>   Corporate and immigration law experts said the approach has the
potential to become a private "enforcement tool" supplanting federal
employer sanctions laws, but only if plaintiffs can pass the high bar
of proof required under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations statute.</LD>
<LD>   Similar suits have been backed by supporters of strict immigration
law enforcement, who say the prospect of treble damages under RICO
could force employers to think hard before hiring undocumented
workers. That could have a big effect in California, where roughly
half of the estimated 7 million to 12 million illegal immigrants in
the U.S. are employed.</LD>
<TE>   Filed in federal court in Tennessee on behalf of four U.S. citizen
employees, the civil lawsuit contends that Tyson sought out illegal
immigrants because they accept below-market wages and "deplorable"
working conditions. Legally authorized workers suffered as a result,
the suit claims.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Tyson was indicted by the Justice Department for
allegedly conspiring to smuggle undocumented workers to 15 of its
plants in the South. A Tyson spokesman said the company had not yet
seen the complaint and could not comment.</TE>
<TE>   The suit is the fourth of its type filed by Chicago corporate
attorney Howard Foster, who has received some support from the
Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based group
that favors strict immigration laws and enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits also borrow from the language of immigrant worker
advocates by making the case that undocumented workers are vulnerable
and exploited. The two camps often are at odds.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally associated with mobsters and tax evaders, RICO was
expanded in 1996 to cover the hiring, smuggling or harboring of
illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   To succeed, a RICO lawsuit must first prove that the underlying
crime was committed and then show that a racketeering
enterprise--such as a pact between a smuggler and an
employer--existed on top of that.</TE>
<TE>   A RICO conviction carries the penalty of treble damages. "That's
enough to get any employer's attention," said Mike Hethmon, staff
attorney with the immigration reform group. "People hire illegal
aliens not for ideological but financial reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Hethmon said his group hopes a successful lawsuit will prompt
similar lawsuits in industries with a high percentage of undocumented
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Though initially greeted with skepticism, the legal theory got a
boost in November when the U.S. 2nd Court of Appeals reinstated a
RICO case filed by Foster against a Connecticut janitorial company,
Colin Service Systems Inc., on behalf of a competitor.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties in that case are set to meet with a mediator in late
May, which could lead to a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   A similar case against Zirkle Fruit Co., an apple grower in
Yakima, Wash., was dismissed and now is on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Foster filed suit against IBP Inc. on behalf of two
former legally authorized workers, claiming wages were depressed by
$4 per hour at the company's meatpacking plant in Joslin, Ill,
because of the employment of illegal immigrant workers.</TE>
<TE>   The suit claims that half of the plant's 2,000 employees are
undocumented and that managers actively recruited them.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, IBP said the lawsuit was "unfair and grossly
inaccurate." IBP is owned by Tyson Foods.</TE>
<TE>   Foster said conservative groups have referred potential clients to
him. "I'm not anti-immigrant," said Foster, who directs complex
litigation for the Chicago firm of Johnson &amp; Bell. "I would say I'm
against illegal immigration, against the masses of illegals who are
coming into this country illegally and depressing wages by as much as
30%."</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said the litigation, if successful, also can result
in a lot of money for Foster and his colleagues, including prominent
Seattle class-action attorney Steve Berman, who was involved in
tobacco litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly people who do immigration law would say that opening up
a private enforcement policy like this is potentially very
significant," said Gerald Neuman, a professor at Columbia Law School
specializing in immigration law. "If proven, the damages can be
substantial."</TE>

<LD>From 1992 to 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission referred
609 Wall Street crimes to federal prosecutors. Of that total, 87
people went to prison, fewer than 10 each year on average.</LD>
<LD>   In a federal prison population of 156,238, only 1,021 inmates now
fit even a broad definition of white-collar criminals. And more than
half of them are doing easy time at low-security "Club Fed"
institutions.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1985, the percentage of white-collar criminals in our
federal prison population has dropped almost fivefold.</LD>
<TE>   We have Fortune magazine to thank for providing these dismaying
statistics. And for the sentiment they evoke: The cover of the March
18 issue of the magazine came to a blunt conclusion: "It's time to
stop coddling white-collar crooks. Send them to jail."</TE>
<TE>   I like to think of myself as a law-and-order man. But friends,
there is something way wrong in the land. Our double standard for
white-collar crime is itself a crime. As Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.
said, sometimes we need an "education in the obvious."</TE>
<TE>   Consider this: In the year 2000, all the bank robberies and
armored-car holdups in the nation added up to $78 million, far less
than the individual gross of any number of shady wheeler-dealers in
business. How many billions of dollars of investments vanished in
recent months behind complex webs of white-collar manipulation?</TE>
<TE>   Where is the outrage?</TE>
<TE>   Compare the stink in Washington today with just a few short years
ago when President Clinton was made to admit lying about a dalliance.
That misdeed absorbed most of the energy of our government and
politics for a couple of years. Principles and values and the example
of leadership were at stake, we were told. But aren't they at least
as much now, too? And in ways that touch us all?</TE>
<TE>   Our differing attitudes about street crime and suite crime are
strange, to say the least. Law enforcement authorities are now
arguing for the right to sentence a petty thief to 50 years in
California prison for shoplifting $153 worth of videos. Yet President
Bush's response to Enron is to propose that corporate executives give
back their bonuses if they are caught swindling investors with cooked
books.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than ripping into this scandal, Wall Street and official
Washington are unconscionably mounting an all-out "don't-worry,
be-happy" defense of the status quo. Oh yes, we'll fiddle here and
there with 401(k) blackouts and accounting self-regulation. But
really, we should trust the market to do the heavy work of
reestablishing legitimacy to business.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be careful . . . not to look to a significant
expansion of regulation as the solution to current problems," Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in a speech last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I frankly don't see a need for lots of new law," Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill told a group of investors.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to keep in mind the competitive position of our nation
and its businesses," Eastman Kodak Co.'s CEO Daniel Carp warned in an
appearance before business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Let me put it in political terms: For the life of me, I cannot
understand why liberals aren't reaching for the high ground here. For
every multimillionaire donor, aren't there 5,000 people wondering
what happened to their retirement investments or their jobs?
Democrats seem to have lost the ability to even fathom a scandal, let
along capitalize on it. Perhaps they invested in secret partnerships
like those at Enron, where insiders turned $5,800 into $1 million in
two months.</TE>
<TE>   And conservatives, where is their famed intolerance? White-collar
crime mocks the oldest of American values, honest work. You'd think
Republicans would be up in arms against such permissiveness.</TE>
<TE>   In the last dozen years, American business has enjoyed ever more
freedom from regulation. Business ethics have correspondingly sunk to
a modern low.</TE>
<TE>   The system's supposed watchdogs, the brokers and credit raters and
accountants, have become corrupted by divided loyalties. Each month
seems to bring fresh evidence that a rapacious few are absconding
with an ever-greater share of our prosperity--and not by giving us
better service or more desirable products, but by high-flying and too
often reckless gamesmanship. Who has faith that what a corporation
reports is faithful to the truth?</TE>
<TE>   There oughtta be a law. And that law ought to be enforced. We need
to get these people off the streets and put them in prison with the
shoplifters.</TE>

<LD>Events of recent weeks make absolutely clear that there will be no
peace in the Middle East until the cost reaches truly massive
proportions for either the Palestinians, Israel or the U.S. We are
not there yet. The question is: Who will break first?</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians now have nothing left to lose. They are willingly
dying in suicide operations and being killed in the streets by tanks,
but the national rage against the 35-year-old occupation generates an
ever-deepening pool of candidates to fight and die. The Ariel Sharon
blueprint of escalating military repression to stop terror has in
fact multiplied terrorist attacks. Israeli intelligence officers
regularly point out that massive repression will not work.</LD>
<LD>   Tell Yasser Arafat to end the terror? The terror is now totally
decentralized as the Palestinian government infrastructure is
destroyed. Daily humiliation of Arafat spells deepened humiliation of
all Palestinians, whatever criticisms they have of their elected
leader. Endless humiliation is more dangerous than rage.</LD>
<TE>   Without Arafat, there will be no central command. No Palestinian
leader can unilaterally abandon guerrilla war and terrorism, the only
weapons he has, for continuation of endless uncertain negotiations
with an Israeli government whose stated goals exclude an acceptable
solution.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon also has nowhere to go. He is determined to keep the
settlements, to refuse a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, and
he will not grant genuine sovereign rights to a Palestine state. If
he wavers from this, his coalition is over. Benjamin Netanyahu waits
in the wings to terminate the Palestinian Authority entirely and
reject any Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis are victims of horrendous daily terrorism as
understandable existential anxieties crowd out any liberal response.
The mantra is "stop the terror" rather than attending to the root
cause--"end the occupation."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has bought Sharon's argument that the basic problem is
terror. The president is "standing firm" and has effectively granted
Israel an open license to eliminate terrorism in its midst. It will
not happen.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, anger at the U.S. is growing exponentially; it will be
only a matter of time before terror is visited against Americans
abroad, by people who have nothing to do with Osama bin Ladin and his
ideology.</TE>
<TE>   Will terrorism against Israel end when Israel withdraws from the
occupied territories?</TE>
<TE>   Any honest analysis must acknowledge it will not, at least
overnight. Anger runs deep and fanatics who want to destroy Israel
remain. But only when the Palestinians have a genuine stake in the
new state and its sovereign freedom--something to lose--will the
atmosphere of society change. Only then will radicals be perceived as
damaging to their state, society and future. Only then can a
Palestinian government start its own crackdown internally on the
remaining radicals, as the value of violence fades under new
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   So putting aside all moral judgments, who will break first?</TE>
<TE>   A prosperous, independent Israel has the most to lose as the
terror continues unabated--as it surely will--and the occupation
becomes untenable. The Palestinians will not break further because
they are already broken as a government; terrorist acts become local,
individualized acts of patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also has a great deal to lose, but the Bush
administration seemingly believes that resolute toughness will
prevail. For the administration, the Palestinian struggle is
basically a nuisance that complicates the road to war in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Washington further rejects the Palestinian leadership because it
may have sought support from Iran and Iraq. If that is so, does that
change the above equation of Palestinian aspirations and Israeli
rejection? Do counter-terrorism and military force become the sum
total, the sole prism, of our global foreign policy?</TE>

<HD>Stop the Dream of an 'Arab Bomb'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A good friend of mine, the senior correspondent for a major Arab
newspaper, told me a joke: "I have great news for you," said the
psychologist to his patient. "You are not suffering from an
inferiority complex. You are inferior."</LD>
<LD>   We were musing about the military situation in the Middle East.
"Can you imagine," my friend said while staring at his martini, "a
people 122 million strong who couldn't militarily beat a group less
than 4% of its size? All of this repeating itself again and again and
again for 54 years?"</LD>
<LD>   The drama of Arab military inferiority to Israel is entrenched in
the Arab psyche. It was underscored in the June 1982 air battle
between Syria and Israel: 94 Syrian fighter jets were shot down; the
only Israeli plane lost was downed by ground fire.</LD>
<TE>   We in the West are aware of Israel's "might" and its "victories,"
and we forget the insult these two words present to the proud Arab
people.</TE>
<TE>   That is why the Arab nations hope that Saddam Hussein will create
the long-awaited "Arab bomb."</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney is still unpacking his luggage from a
tour that was supposed to persuade Arab nations to support the United
States in an attack on Iraq--the only Arab nation that has a
realistic chance of creating what seems to be the only way to bypass
Israel's military superiority.</TE>
<TE>   So, because the only way the Arab nations can overcome Israel is
to nuke it, and the only person who is close to this capacity is
Hussein, our effort to get other Arab leaders to end his potential
nuclear capacity is similar to training a camel to fly.</TE>
<TE>   Here is the certainty: When Iraqi scientists present their
dictator with the bomb on a given morning, it will detonate over
Israel that afternoon. For those smart, civilized strategists who say
that Hussein would not endanger his Palestinian brethren, I would
like to remind them that he already has killed more than 100,000 of
his own people in "police actions."</TE>
<TE>   In December 1977, I interviewed Egyptian President Anwar Sadat for
"The MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour" on public television. After the
interview, Sadat recommended that I meet Field Marshal Mohamed
Abdel-Ghani Gamasi, commander of all of Egypt's forces. When I met
with the tall, handsome field marshal, he said, "You, people of the
West, must understand that until we find an answer to the Israeli
bomb, we won't sleep well. When we snore, you won't sleep well
either."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. can forget about any cooperation with an Arab country in
attacking Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   To the contrary: We may anticipate their cooperation with Iraq
against us, not necessarily by fighting us on the ground but by
aiding Iraq with intelligence, moral support and threats of an oil
embargo. Unfortunately, Hussein's Arab bomb will be their ticket to
military equality with or even superiority over Israel. No Arab
leader would dare dampen that Arab dream.</TE>
<TE>   We must get used to the idea that we are alone in this battle--and
like it or not, the earlier we attack Iraq, the less the chance of
Israel or the United States being nuked.</TE>

<HD>Don't Blame Bush: The Peace Process Was Already in Ashes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SATLOFF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A revisionist critique of the Bush administration's Middle East
policy holds that blame for the current Palestinian-Israeli violence
should be laid at the doorstep of a White House that invested too
little, too late in the "peace process." Before this canard takes
hold, let's set the record straight.</LD>
<LD>   When President Bush came to office in January 2001, the
Palestinian uprising against Israel was 4 months old, and the promise
of the Camp David peace talks was a distant memory. The uprising
already had morphed from a popular revolt to a full-scale guerrilla
war. It was clear then that Yasser Arafat had violated the basic
foundation on which the entire Oslo edifice was constructed:
renouncing armed struggle.</LD>
<LD>   Just two weeks later, almost two-thirds of Israeli voters ousted
Ehud Barak as prime minister. Barak had lost his people's confidence
by continuing diplomatic concessions in the midst of the intifada.
New Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's mandate was to develop and
implement a different strategy. He formed a unity government, arguing
that with national unity Israel could prevail in even the most
violent guerrilla contest. And he promised that Israel would not
negotiate under fire.</LD>
<TE>   In this environment, the Bush administration concluded that
circumstances were not ripe for a high-level effort to restart peace
negotiations, and that the most urgent task was to prevent a regional
war while fighting terrorism and weapons proliferation. Indeed, I
co-chaired a bipartisan group of 52 members of Congress, scholars,
diplomats and regional experts that made just such a recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   While the events of Sept. 11 loom large over everything that has
occurred in the Middle East since, the most underreported story since
the start of the Palestinian uprising has been the fact that
Washington's worst fear, regional war, has been averted. A menacing
Arab street rising up in sympathy with the Palestinians and attacking
pro-American regimes around the region--a fear so real a year
ago--has not happened.</TE>
<TE>   Arab states that utter so much sympathy for the Palestinian cause
have done pitifully little for the Palestinian people. Indeed, the
good news from Arafat's trying to smuggle armaments from Iran is that
he had to resort to petitioning the ayatollahs because no Arab
country would join in his crusade against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this, the Bush administration still opted to pursue
meaningful diplomacy. It endorsed a cease-fire recommended by former
Sen. George J. Mitchell's Clinton-era fact-finding commission. It
dispatched CIA Director George J. Tenet, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell and even Vice President Dick Cheney to offer Arafat political
rehabilitation if he would meet the most meager conditions.</TE>
<TE>   All these initiatives failed as the bombers continued to seek
their place in a perverse heaven. The fault lies not with U.S.
passivity, U.S. inactivity or the wrong level of U.S. engagement. The
initiatives failed because while Israelis yearn for a cease-fire,
Palestinians--from Arafat to the nationalist or Islamist
organizations that dispatch the bombers--see the deliberate targeting
of civilians as a legitimate tool to achieve political ends.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, the Bush team recognized that diplomacy had exhausted
its usefulness to Arafat when he learned that he too would have to
make compromises to achieve peace. His turn to violence (first of the
intifada variety, then of the suicide bomber type) was, for him, a
logical move. But instead of cutting ties with Arafat for his
complicity in terror, as Bush's father did in 1990, the
administration has continued to hold out the promise of partnership
should Arafat mend his ways. This failure to apply real political
pressure on Arafat has forced Israel to seek security by applying
military pressure on him.</TE>
<TE>   It's not too late. The president should drop the pose that Arafat
is redeemable. Instead, Washington should publicly differentiate
between the Palestinian cause and the current Palestinian leadership
and promise real assistance to achieve full statehood--but only when
the Palestinians have a leadership worthy of our help.</TE>
<TE>   Without a common interest among Israelis and Palestinians in
ending violence, no level of U.S. engagement can make it happen.</TE>

<LD>Openness is a hallmark of this nation's legal system. The founding
fathers knew that secret court proceedings give cover to corrupt or
tyrannical judges and sloppy prosecutors, that judges who can hide
can easily abuse power. Yet shortly after the September terrorist
attacks, immigration judges around the country slammed shut the doors
of their courtrooms, barring the public, the press and even relatives
of the oh-so-vaguely accused men and women rounded up by the
thousands under blanket orders from the attorney general.</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge could decide this week whether this secrecy should
stand. We hope she agrees that it should not.</LD>
<LD>   The case before the Detroit federal court involves proceedings
against Rabih Haddad, a Muslim religious and community leader from
Ann Arbor, Mich. Haddad is a Lebanese citizen who has lived in the
United States on and off for the past 20 years. He last entered in
1998 under a tourist visa, which has since expired.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Haddad applied for permanent residency. As part of the
mass arrests of Middle Eastern men after Sept. 11, federal agents
picked up Haddad for overstaying his visa. He has been jailed since
and is now being held in a Chicago federal prison, in solitary
confinement, pending a final deportation hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The government has made no allegation that Haddad had any role in
the terrorist attacks, which he loudly condemned. Yet in December,
the court barred Haddad's family, along with newspaper and television
reporters and Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), from attending his
first immigration hearing. In closing the doors, the judge in that
proceeding was acting in accordance with a September memo issued by
the chief immigration judge, on orders from Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit News and Conyers have brought suit challenging the
blanket closed-door order. A similar case is pending in a New Jersey
federal court.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs are not insensitive to Ashcroft's concern that
information jeopardizing national security will be made public if
these hearings are open. Rather, they argue that before imposing
secrecy the government must show, based on the evidence in each case,
that allowing in the press and the public would put the nation at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   The government would be hard-pressed to make that claim in
Haddad's case. His lawyers, who were not bound by a gag order, said
that no evidence presented in that first hearing bore the slightest
resemblance to a national security threat.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft no doubt figures he has his hands full fighting terrorism
and that the courts should not be bothered with such distinctions. We
hope the judge in Detroit and then the one in New Jersey will offer
rulings to remind him that fair trials and open government are
precisely the democratic virtues he is supposed to be defending.</TE>

<LD>In predawn raids last week, a combined force of FBI agents and
Pakistani police shot and took into custody one of Osama bin Laden's
top aides. The arrest demonstrated the kind of teamwork that must
continue in the hunt for Al Qaeda terrorists and their Taliban
protectors. But recent developments raise the question of how much
help Pakistan is willing to provide.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf supplied additional forces
for the raids, which seized dozens of men, including Abu Zubeida,
believed to have helped orchestrate the Sept. 11 massacre and earlier
attacks. On Tuesday White House spokesman Ari Fleischer called
Zubeida a "key terrorist recruiter and operational planner" for Al
Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   Police on Tuesday reported another series of raids and arrests in
what they said was a crackdown on Bin Laden's network in Pakistan.
One unanswered question is why it took so long. Zubeida and some
cohorts apparently fled from Afghanistan into Pakistan in December.
Pakistani law enforcement has supposedly been on high alert since
Musharraf said after the September terrorism that he was turning his
back on Islamic extremists in his country and casting his lot with
Washington. So why have so many Taliban and Al Qaeda members been
able to play hide-and-seek for so long with Pakistani intelligence
agencies?</LD>
<TE>   Washington is also concerned that Musharraf recently freed
hundreds of militants arrested since December, when he began
outlawing extremist groups. Musharraf, who is attempting to hold and
win a referendum to remain president, may be using this wholesale
dumping as a tactic to gain support from religious groups. Whatever
the reason, it undercuts the U.S. attempt to find Taliban and Al
Qaeda fighters in Pakistan and stop them from regrouping and renewing
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic extremists do pose a real threat to Musharraf. They are
probably to blame for the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter
Daniel Pearl in February, the killing of the brother of Musharraf's
interior minister and the bombing of a Christian church last month
that killed five people, including a U.S. Embassy employee and her
daughter. Still, it's a blunder for Musharraf to go easy on
extremists now. Rather, he needs to push even harder to clean out his
enemies in the government's notorious Inter-Services Intelligence
agency, many of whom have close ties to the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the United States must show its friendship to
Musharraf, both by offering economic assistance to develop his
desperately poor country and by bluntly reminding him that it's in
his own best interests to search ever harder for the aspiring mass
murders hiding in Pakistan.</TE>

<LD>Mark Smith has served 17 years in prison for his part in a drug-
related killing. He suffers from AIDS, cancer, heart disease and
progressive dementia. Because of the time he has been behind bars,
his exemplary behavior as a prisoner and his fragile medical
condition, the state Board of Prison Terms recommended that he be
paroled. That was almost two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis overturned the board's parole recommendation, in
essence sentencing Smith to die in custody. It would seem that in
Davis' reelection-focused mind, any parolee, even one as sick as
Smith, could be the star in an attack ad from his gubernatorial
opponent.</LD>
<LD>   Last month a Los Angeles judge overruled Davis and ordered Smith's
release, saying there was no evidence to support the governor's
action. The judge also said Davis had wrongly labeled Smith a killer
rather than an accomplice in the case. Tuesday, Chief Justice Ronald
M. George temporarily stayed Smith's release pending review by the
entire California Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   We hope that the court agrees with the Los Angeles judge and lets
Smith go. Davis' rigid and politically driven parole policy seems
meant to protect himself from any campaign accusations that he is
"soft on crime." But it is costly to taxpayers and unfair to those
few inmates who deserve parole and threatens to usurp the parole
board's lawful authority.</TE>
<TE>   Since Davis took office in 1999, the Board of Prison Terms, hardly
a hotbed of bleeding hearts, has found 82 convicted killers suitable
for parole, about 1% of all the cases that came before it. California
law allows the governor to block parole in cases where he disagrees
with the board's decision or to ask the board to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   However, Davis took office vowing that no murderers would go free
on his watch, no matter the circumstances. He has made exactly one
exception, for a woman who shot her abusive boyfriend. The governor
relented in that case--no doubt with an eye toward women
voters--having concluded that she might never have been convicted had
the battered-woman legal defense been available at the time of her
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's case represents the second time a court has rebuked Davis
for his hard line. The first involved a man convicted at age 18 of
second-degree murder for the 1985 killing of a Calabasas schoolmate
who had threatened to expose him as a homosexual. Although the
governor insisted that the inmate posed a "significant risk to
society," an appeals court this year said Davis had exceeded his
authority to decide paroles, which the court said was not absolute.</TE>
<TE>   Californians are poorly served by the governor's harsh approach.
State law sets up a process to determine which few inmates merit
release. Davis' deathly fear of the soft-on-crime tag is not reason
enough to put his veto power on autopilot.</TE>

<HD>Dr. Nobuyuki Kawata, 81; Cardiologist at UCLA</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Nobuyuki Kawata, UCLA cardiologist and professor who helped
develop the UCLA Heart Failure and Heart Transplant Program, which is
now among the world's largest, has died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Kawata died March 27 at UCLA Medical Center of complications from
chronic lung disease, university officials said.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,100 heart transplants have been performed at UCLA
since Kawata helped establish the program in 1984 along with Dr.
Hillel Laks.</LD>
<TE>   "His [Kawata's] leadership has elevated the state of cardiology at
UCLA and has contributed to its prominence," said Laks, now director
of the UCLA Heart and Lung Transplant Program.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gerald S. Levey, provost of UCLA Medical Sciences and dean of
the UCLA School of Medicine, called Kawata "a true leader and
visionary in the field of cardiology."</TE>
<TE>   Kawata also founded the private medical practice known as
University Cardiovascular Medical Group, based on the campus, and
worked with UCLA for patient care, research and teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Known as a gifted teacher, Kawata earned the annual UCLA Clinical
Faculty Teaching Award six times during the 22 years he taught at the
university. He was also a benefactor of UCLA and endowed the Chizuko
Kawata Chair in Cardiology honoring his late first wife.</TE>
<TE>   A native Californian, Kawata and his family spent World War II in
a Japanese American internment camp.</TE>
<TE>   He later founded the Japanese American Medical Assn. and worked
actively in the Japan-American Society and the Japanese American
National Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Kawata earned a bachelor's degree in zoology and a master's in
physiology from Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., then
received his medical degree at UC San Francisco and served in the
Army Medical Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining UCLA in 1980, he was chief of medicine and chief of
staff at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, where he was
instrumental in expanding rehabilitation services and facilities for
stroke victims.</TE>
<TE>   Kawata is survived by his second wife, Elaine Albanese; two
children, Diana Watanabe and Dr. Carol Kawata; two brothers, Teruo
and Sakae Kawata; a sister, Miyeko Uriu; and five grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for 9 a.m. Saturday in the First
United Methodist Church in Santa Monica.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>John Paterson, 78, retired professor of English and expert on the
English novel who wrote books about Edwardian behavior, died Friday
in a Greenbrae, Calif., hospital after a long illness.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Scotland, Paterson moved to Canada at age 2, grew up
in Montreal and graduated from McGill University. He earned a
doctorate at the University of Michigan, taught briefly at Princeton
and then was on the UC Berkeley faculty from 1956 until his
retirement in 1985.</LD>
<LD>   One of his major books was the 1974 "The Novel as Faith: The
Gospel According to James, Hardy, Conrad, Joyce, Lawrence and
Virginia Woolf," which a New Yorker reviewer praised as an "urbane,
intellectually sophisticated work."</LD>
<TE>   Paterson's final book, "Edwardians: London Life and Letters,
1901-1914," was published in 1996. The Chicago Tribune reviewed it as
a "splendid melange of Edwardian manners, mores and gossip."</TE>

<LD>"Pupils Shunted to Vocational Ed Fear It Can Derail College Dreams"
(March 27), about LAUSD students in vocational classes, unfairly
portrayed the Regional Occupational Program as a dumping ground for
students, denying some their chances of attending college. The ROP
strives to improve the prospects for all students, including those
planning to attend college. Many adolescents have little idea of what
it takes to achieve their dreams, and a ROP class provides important
insights about the discipline and work ethic needed.</LD>
<LD>   Fewer than 25% of Americans over 25 have a four-year college
degree. For three-quarters of Americans, life after high school means
going to work. High school is often the last opportunity to get the
free training they need to secure meaningful employment. Many
students who do go to college will need a job to afford it.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, students end up in ROP classes who don't want to be
there. (Same for algebra.) But why malign the program? If students
are being misguided into vocational classes, it's indicative of an
overburdened system. But give the ROP credit for answering the call
of Californians who say that public schools need to better prepare
students for the work force.</LD>

<TE>   Your article was about schools in poor areas where counselors have
600 to 700 students who cannot get the guidance they need. I live in
a relatively affluent area and, yes, our high school counselors have
600 to 700 students. This is the reality in public high schools
today. Only if the parents--or in some cases the students--are savvy,
motivated and assertive will the students transition to college
successfully.</TE>

<LD>Re "DWP's Spending Comes Under Scrutiny," March 31: Those silver belt
buckles are a safety award, awarded for being accident-free for 10
years in a row. If being accident-free is considered being a
"top-performing department employee" in our hazardous industry, any
manager or city controller should be proud to honor those employees
whether they be in private or public industry.</LD>
<LD>   Considering the cost of one belt buckle versus an employee
recuperating in a hospital or at home from an on-the-job injury, it
shouldn't be hard to figure out. It's all math. I have one and
proudly wear it.</LD>

<TE>   City Controller Laura Chick is right on the nose when she
complains that the DWP is acting like a business when it is really a
city agency. As a bureaucrat, Chick knows that a government agency
should not be making a profit, should not be responsive to the
constituents it serves and, heaven forbid, should not have satisfied
customers. Let us join Chick's intifada to bring the DWP down to her
level.</TE>

<LD>A hearty "bravo" to Kristine McKenna for her remarks on public
courtesy and its often minimal display in our culture ("Any Which Way
but Proper," Opinion, March 31). While one must certainly admit
variety of custom from one society or one age to another, common
decency and respect for other individuals should still be the norm;
i.e., do to others as you would be done to.</LD>
<LD>   In a time in which senseless violence such as road rage and other
similar manifestations is so prevalent, perhaps attention to such
seemingly insignificant actions as flushing public toilets and using
automobile turn signals (essentially the same action, requiring the
same amount of energy) could help to reestablish our sense of what
the best of "civil"-ization is meant to be.</LD>

<HD>Security Council Calls for Israel to Withdraw</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is perturbing to witness the one-sided response to the
Israeli/Palestinian conflict. The worldwide uproar and condemnation
over Israel's acts of self-defense ring hollow and shallow when the
same condemning people and nations were so silent while terrorists
sponsored by Yasser Arafat continued through the Easter weekend to
kill innocent Israelis through suicide bombings.</LD>
<LD>   Israel had shown great restraint before finally acting after the
Passover bombing. Can you imagine the uproar if Israelis similarly
killed Palestinians during their holy days?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Ariel Sharon's so-called "war on terror" Israeli soldiers have
been conducting large-scale house-to-house searches, engaging in
detention and mass arrests of boys and men, destroying personal
property and PA infrastructure and a general terrorizing of the
civilian population (which is now living under siege without access
to basic provisions).</TE>
<TE>   Ramallah has gone from one of the West Bank's finest cities to
something that resembles post-WWII Europe. Even medics and the media
have been denied access to areas under siege. If these aren't war
crimes then the phrase has no meaning.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for President Bush to stop parroting the same line
suggesting Arafat (confined to what's left of his compound) must do
more. It's time for Bush to do more and demand an end to this assault
and an end to the occupation--the root of all this evil.</TE>
<TE>   Alia Hasan</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By openly declaring that he wants to be a "martyr," I believe that
Arafat is indicating he has no real intention for peace of any kind
in that troubled land. Because why do people choose to die for their
cause? Typically it is in the hope that others will remember them and
fight with that much more alacrity.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't this seem to be the rallying cry for the terrorists who
struck last September?</TE>
<TE>   Arafat is the epitome of a terrorist's terrorist. I'm convinced of
this now. I, like others, have held out for a long time thinking that
maybe, just maybe, Arafat could be instrumental in securing an end to
violence in the Middle East. Well, he sure fooled me. But I guess
that's what he's best at.</TE>

<TE>   Even we ordinary citizens can see the carnage brought by years of
teaching Arab/Muslim hatred toward Israel and democracies. Why is it
that the U.N. refuses to condemn the barbaric terrorist acts, yet
when Israel merely tries to defend its people and root out the
terrorist sources the Security Council passes a resolution aimed at
Israel alone (March 30)? Does every country but Israel have the right
to defend itself?</TE>
<TE>   Donald Salem</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   War is not the answer to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The
U.S. must impose the Saudi peace proposal on Israel. A political
settlement must go hand in hand with a cease-fire. The Palestinians
have waited 10 years for their state, for self-determination. The
Israelis dragged their feet the entire time. Sharon never subscribed
to the Oslo agreement. This is why the suicide bombers are escalating
their attacks. They feel the Israelis will never stop their
expansionist policies. They have consistently increased their
settlements and, with over 1,000 Palestinian deaths, it indicates
that the Israelis are aiming at a total ethnic cleansing of the
remainder of the Palestinians in the territories.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis need to return to the 1967 borders and take the
settlers with them. They should give all the settlements to the
Palestinians as compensation for all the Palestinian homes they have
destroyed. The U.S. should demonstrate to the world its true
commitment to peace by sending U.S. troops to ensure the division of
the two sides and to force Israel to return to its 1967 borders.</TE>

<HD>Arctic Drilling: Worth the Damage?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Arctic Drilling Study Cites Wildlife Risk," March 30: Has anyone
ever heard of a government project that didn't take longer, cost
more, do more damage and get bigger than they said it would? The
administration may say that little damage will be done to wildlife
and the environment by drilling for the small amount of oil estimated
to be in this area, about six months' worth by the the most
optimistic estimates, but we all know that once the drilling is
allowed to start, it will escalate considerably.</LD>
<LD>   The amount of oil found here could be more than equaled by
conservation and developing alternative energy sources. If this
administration weren't so chummy with the oil industry, it would quit
pushing for more drilling and do more to become less reliant on oil.</LD>
<LD>   No matter how you look at it, we'll never be able to find enough
oil to satisfy our needs when we have only 3% of the world's reserves
and use 25% of the oil produced now. It's just not worth six months'
worth of oil to destroy the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</LD>
<TE>   Joan Scott</TE>
<TE>   Yorba Linda</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Senate will be taking up the ANWR debate soon, and I think
there are many questions, pro and con, that remain to be answered.
One that I have concerns the ultimate destination of the oil from the
ANWR. It would be interesting to know how much of the Alaska crude is
now being used domestically and how much is being sent to Asia. What
assurance do we have that the ANWR oil is not going to be sold in a
foreign market?</TE>
<TE>   I hope the GOP is not using the "patriotic theme" to the
betterment of big oil.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Wah</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While the Arab-Israeli conflict spirals into regional war, our
government strives to build support for an invasion of Iraq. While
our dependence on foreign and Near East oil steadily increases, our
government advocates disruption of Alaskan wildlife to pump a six
months' supply of oil. While the Arctic and Antarctic icecaps melt
and the global ocean currents that regulate the Earth's climate
weaken, our government refuses to consider any action to reduce
global warming that might reduce corporate earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of farsighted and responsible actions we get simplistic
platitudes designed to lull our concerns. Perhaps it's time for a
less arrogant, ignorant and selfish set of government policies.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Humane Law Backfires," editorial, March 29: Animal control
directors should not have to choose between holding too many animals
in limited space in violation of animal cruelty laws or adhering to
the [former state Sen. Tom] Hayden myth that the hundreds of
thousands of stray, unwanted, dangerous or ill animals that end up in
California shelters every year will all find homes if they are just
kept long enough. This failed experiment should be ended.</LD>
<LD>   It is the obligation of animal control agencies to provide public
safety, a humane environment for impounded pets and to address the
cruelty issues and lack of owner accountability that are the source
of our burgeoning animal-human problems. We are seeing all too
clearly that diverting their efforts and resources away from this
task can be (literally) deadly.</LD>

<HD>Mace Brown, 92; Pitcher Gave Up Pivotal Homer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mace Brown, one of the first pitchers in baseball to excel in a
relief role but perhaps better known for giving up Gabby Hartnett's
"homer in the gloamin'" that helped the Cubs clinch the National
League pennant in 1938, has died. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Brooklyn Dodgers and
Boston Red Sox and twice led the National League in saves, died March
24 at his home in Greensboro, N.C. The cause of death was not
announced.</LD>
<LD>   The year he gave up the home run to Hartnett was also Brown's best
in the majors. He posted a 15-9 record with the Pirates and made the
National League All-Star team, pitching the last three innings of a
4-1 victory over the American League. He also topped the league that
season with 51 appearances while starting just two games as he helped
pioneer the role of the relief pitcher as specialist.</LD>
<TE>   His confrontation with Hartnett came late in the season in Chicago
against a Cubs team that had a seven-game winning streak and was
trailing the league-leading Pirates by a game and a half.</TE>
<TE>   In those days, Wrigley Field had no lights, and the games
generally didn't start until 3 p.m. So it was not uncommon,
especially late in the season, for darkness to fall if the game ran
long. In that case the game would be finished the next day.</TE>
<TE>   The game was tied 5-5 after 81/2 innings and Brown was called in
to pitch the ninth. The umpires told both teams that the game would
be called if the Cubs didn't score in the bottom of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   With a devastating overhand curve, Brown quickly disposed of the
first two Cub batters. Hartnett, who later said he could barely see
the ball, swung and missed Brown's first pitch and fouled off his
next delivery. Brown came back with a third consecutive curveball,
and despite the twilight--the "gloaming"--Hartnett connected with the
pitch and drove it into the left-field stands.</TE>
<TE>   Fans spilled onto the field as Hartnett rounded the bases and Cub
teammates escorted him home.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the moment, Hartnett said: "I swung with everything I
had, and then I got that feeling--the kind of feeling you get when
the blood rushes to your head and you get dizzy."</TE>
<TE>   And although a lot of fans said they didn't know where the ball
landed, Hartnett said he had no doubt when he hit the pitch. Neither
did Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "When Gabby hit it, I just turned and walked off the mound," Brown
recalled in an interview with The Times years ago. "I knew it was
gone, and I didn't want to see the celebrating."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bad pitch. I tried to keep the ball away from him, and I
didn't."</TE>
<TE>   The next day the Cubs pounded the Pirates 10-1 to win the pennant.
The "homer in the gloamin'" had fueled their drive to the World
Series and gave Brown notoriety that would stay with him all his
life.</TE>
<TE>   Born in North English, Iowa, Brown had an early interest in
baseball, but his high school did not have a baseball team, so Brown
joined the track team. He attended the University of Iowa on a track
scholarship--he was a javelin thrower--before joining the Iowa
baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   He first played catcher at Iowa because the team had a fine
pitcher in Forrest Twogood, who later gained fame as a basketball
coach at USC. But Brown switched to pitcher in his junior year and
posted a 9-1 record, winning nearly half of Iowa's games.</TE>
<TE>   After playing semipro baseball in the summer, he was ruled
ineligible for his senior year at Iowa. Signed by the St. Louis
Cardinals, Brown spent the next four years in the minor leagues
before Pittsburgh obtained his contract. He made his major league
debut in 1935.</TE>
<TE>   As a rookie that year, he witnessed one of the indelible moments
in baseball history.</TE>
<TE>   Babe Ruth, at the tail end of his illustrious career, was playing
out the string with the Boston Braves.</TE>
<TE>   On May 25, 1935, Ruth hit his last three home runs against the
Pirates at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   After his last home run--his 714th, which sailed past the
grandstand in right field and was later measured at about 600
feet--Ruth headed for the Braves' clubhouse. But to do so, he had to
pass through the Pirate dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sitting on the end of the bench next to the runway," Brown
recalled in an interview with Associated Press years ago. "He came
over and he happened to sit right next to me at the end of the
bench," Brown said. "He said, 'Boy, that last one felt good.' He sat
there for a few minutes right beside me."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's wife, Sue, who was in the stands that day, recorded Ruth's
three home runs on a movie camera, but over the years the film
disintegrated and the Browns discarded it.</TE>
<TE>   Brown pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers for one season before being
traded to the Red Sox. In 1943, he led American League pitchers in
number of games played. After military service in 1944 and 1945,
Brown pitched one last season for the Red Sox, helping them to the
pennant before retiring.</TE>
<TE>   He worked as a scout for the Red Sox over the next three decades
and was instrumental in their decision to draft Jim Rice, the
slugging outfielder from South Carolina who was a Red Sox star in the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Brown was asked a few years ago if "the homer in the gloamin'"
still bothered him.</TE>
<TE>   "Not anymore," he said. "Like a fellow once said to me, 'If it
hadn't been for Hartnett, nobody would have remembered you.' He was
right."</TE>
<TE>   Brown is survived by a son, a daughter, five grandchildren and
seven great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Travel Agency to Pay Molested Teen</HD>
<DH>Settlement: Firm arranged trip without background check of
chaperons, suit says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WALNUT CREEK, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A travel agency for Roman Catholic priests has agreed to pay an
unspecified sum to the family of a teenager who says a phony
Franciscan brother drugged and molested him during a trip that the
company organized.</LD>
<LD>   The family of Clay Brasuell said the accord was reached hours
before the case was to go to trial in Santa Cruz County Superior
Court.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit sought to hold Tracy, Calif.-based Fiat Voluntas Tua
liable for failing to conduct a better background check on chaperons.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement comes amid a wave of revelations about sexual abuse
of children by Catholic priests and allegations that church leaders
shielded the clergymen and paid millions of dollars to settle claims.</TE>
<TE>   "This puts every employer on notice to be more diligent about
doing background checks of people they hire," said Peter Alfert, an
attorney for the family. "It's even more important for religious and
other organizations serving young people."</TE>
<TE>   The suit centered on claims that Anthony Thomas Falco, then 60,
posed as a Franciscan in 1999 and during a pilgrimage to an
international youth festival in Bosnia, drugged and molested
Brasuell, then 16.</TE>
<TE>   Falco is serving a six-year sentence after pleading guilty to lewd
conduct and furnishing marijuana to minors in connection with the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Other defendants in the case, the Roman Catholic Bishop of
Monterey, St. Joseph's Catholic Church of Santa Cruz, and its pastor,
the Rev. Patrick Dooling, settled out of court last year, lawyers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Falco had ingratiated himself with Dooling by saying he was a
former Episcopalian priest who became a Franciscan.</TE>
<TE>   Falco wore the traditional Franciscan garb: a long brown flowing
robe with a knotted belt, a large cross around his neck, and sandals.</TE>
<TE>   He later told Dooling that he was a homosexual and a drug user,
and had been arrested for possessing child pornography, lawyers say.</TE>
<TE>   Fiat Voluntas Tua, Latin for "Thy will be done," couldn't be
reached for comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, there goes another round of Sunday offerings. Your Easter
tithes won't pay for hymnbooks or boost the salaries of underpaid
Catholic schoolteachers, but will go straight into the scandal
management fund.</LD>
<LD>   You read about these sex abuse cases each day and wonder if the
national spectacle of hypocrisy and betrayal can get any more
outrageous, and now we know the answer is yes. The latest case
involves an Orange County priest who allegedly got a teenager
pregnant roughly 20 years ago and then quietly paid for her abortion,
breaking perhaps a half-dozen commandments in this one relationship
alone.</LD>
<LD>   But I can't say I'm surprised. The priest happens to be an
acquaintance of mine.</LD>
<TE>   Father John Lenihan got the boot from his Dana Point parish last
year after filling my ear with details of another, unrelated
molestation, and "several" relationships with women, four of which he
called serious. Shortly after I wrote about it, I got a message from
Lori Haigh under the heading: "Father John molested me."</TE>
<TE>   Haigh went on to say:</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the authorities. I was called a liar by priests in high
places. I was crushed."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it was like a lot of mail I get.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh, whose old wounds were reopened when she read my columns
about Father Lenihan, decided to do something about it. On Monday,
the Orange and Los Angeles dioceses paid $1.2 million to settle her
lawsuit, and then she filed a criminal complaint against Lenihan, who
has finally been asked to leave the priesthood now that his sins are
costing the church real money.</TE>
<TE>   But no matter how unforgivable those sins, the Father Lenihans of
the church constitute a minority of priests, and are not the biggest
part of the problem. The greater obscenity is described in a single
sentence of Lori Haigh's e-mail to me.</TE>
<TE>   "I was called a liar by priests in high places."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Haigh said two other priests ignored her pleas for help
when she was being molested. Those two priests now happen to be
high-ranking officials in the Orange Diocese, and one is in charge of
molestation cases.</TE>
<TE>   Is Haigh lying about her rebuffed pleas for help, as one of those
two officials said Monday?</TE>
<TE>   I can't tell you the answer. But I can say that throughout the
country, priests have climbed to the highest levels of church
leadership by keeping their mouths shut about their own sins and
those of others, protecting the church's public image even at the
cost of crushing victims and putting more people within reach of
known predators.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean there's a greater percentage of pedophiles
inside the church than outside, as readers keep telling me. In fact,
based on six months of interviews with priests and parishioners, I
can tell you that priests having sex with women, seminarians and
other priests is far more rampant than the abuse of children.</TE>
<TE>   But church practice has always been to keep quiet about
uncomfortable realities. And so now we have Boston, and West Palm
Beach, and questions about what church leaders knew in New York and
Los Angeles and dozens of other places in this country and around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson of so much public shame is as obvious as the cross on
top of every church: The silent priest is as dangerous as the abusive
one. And yet we still can't get simple answers from the likes of Los
Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony, who refuses to explain why recently
dismissed priests had been kept on the job if they were known
molesters.</TE>
<TE>   Lori Haigh was not the first teenager Father Lenihan went after.
The first was Mary Grant, whose father complained way back in 1978 to
the then-cardinal. Rather than calling the police or at least
defrocking him, church officials kept Lenihan's career kicking along
nicely. When I met with him, it was at a well-heeled church with an
utterly spectacular ocean view. Tall and tanned, he spoke of his jogs
on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan came to my attention last year as part of the $5.2-million
sex abuse settlement involving Msgr. Michael Harris in Orange County.
An ex-bishop was asked in deposition about priests like Lenihan being
kept in jobs where they could do more damage, and the bishop all but
vilified Lenihan's first victim, Mary Grant, saying she might have
been "very precocious or adult-looking."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, and so was Lori Haigh. Two teenagers, molested by a priest
twice their age, were probably asking for it.</TE>
<TE>   When I challenged the ex-bishop's remarks about Lenihan, he said I
had "no integrity" and added, "I wouldn't talk to you if the pope
told me to."</TE>
<TE>   Of course he wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   For the first 2,000 years, at least, silence has served church
leaders well.</TE>

<HD>School Bus Strike Strands Students</HD>
<DH>Labor: Some youngsters stay home or get rides from their
parents. Laidlaw workers are seeking parity with district employees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI, CARA MIA DiMASSA and SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of Los Angeles Unified School District students were left
stranded Tuesday--some for as long as three hours--as school bus
drivers went on strike against the district's main bus contractor,
Laidlaw Educational Services.</LD>
<LD>   The strike by Teamsters Union, Local 572, which followed months of
haggling over salary levels and benefits, is the first in at least
three decades, a district official said. It came so suddenly that
about 100 union members were caught unawares and drove their morning
routes as usual.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of the school day, however, Laidlaw drivers had
abandoned all 700 of their routes, and employees of the district or
its five other bus contractors were scrambling to replace them.</LD>
<TE>   "We knew about the possibility of a strike," said Los Angeles
Unified School District Supt. Roy Romer, "and we had a reserve fleet
ready."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many youngsters and their parents were
inconvenienced--particularly the families of students who attend
magnet schools or who live in overcrowded areas. Many children were
absent, were hours late for school or had to be transported at the
last minute by their parents. About 20,000 students in the district
depend on Laidlaw buses.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been held up in the auditorium for three hours!" yelled one
frustrated student as he boarded a replacement bus at his Koreatown
stop, Virgil Middle School, and headed for Webster Middle School in
West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At the same stop, Jose Gaona, a father who works nights as a
janitor, said he had just fallen asleep when his son, Jose 11, called
to tell him that he and his brother, Ulises, were stuck.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very tired," the elder Gaona said. "I work every night. What
happened? ... How long will this last?"</TE>
<TE>   Teamsters spokesman Rick Middleton said he could foresee the
strike lasting for as long as a month, although he acknowledged that
the local union had no strike fund to help support drivers. Middleton
said the national office in Washington would offer union members
assistance after two weeks on the picket lines.</TE>
<TE>   A federal mediator from the National Labor Relations Board has
called a meeting between the two parties for Thursday morning, and
both sides expect the strike to last at least until then.</TE>
<TE>   Teamsters officials said they want parity with district-employed
drivers, whose hourly wages range from $15 to $22. Laidlaw drivers,
they say, often make half that much and have inferior health and
retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw Vice President Jim Ferraro said the company cannot afford
to compete with district wages. The Teamsters rejected Laidlaw's last
offer in March, and the two sides have been at an impasse since then.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost of living is going up, wages need to go up," said Jason
Baldwin, 23, who has been a Laidlaw driver for five years. "We're
making the point that we're sick of it, we're fed up with it, and
today we're making a stand."</TE>
<TE>   The bus drivers marched outside of all four Laidlaw bus yards
Tuesday morning, chanting slogans including "Si, se puede!" ("Yes, it
can be done!") and "No benefits, no pay raise, no drivers!"</TE>
<TE>   Strike Is a First for Many of the Laidlaw Drivers</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's action was the first time many of the drivers had been
on strike. Outside the entrance of a yard near Inglewood, drivers
leaned on the wall, greeted friends with cheers and hammed it up for
news cameras.</TE>
<TE>   A few drivers were unaware, until they arrived at the bus depot,
that there was a strike. When one driver entered the yard near
Inglewood, strikers pounded on her bus, yelling, "Overworked,
underpaid!"</TE>
<TE>   Although the district had sent letters warning parents of the
possibility late last week, a Teamsters official insisted Monday that
the union had no immediate strike plans.</TE>
<TE>   Magnet school students were most affected by the strike because
many of those campuses take children from all over the city.</TE>
<TE>   Children in areas with crowded schools, like Koreatown, were also
affected because many of them take buses to less crowded schools
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, 150 students waited more than three hours in
the auditorium of Virgil Middle School in Koreatown for buses headed
as far as the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the youngsters waiting at the Virgil stop attend Daniel
Webster Middle School in West Los Angeles, which receives students
from all over the city. Nearly 300 of 1,365 students at Webster were
absent from school Tuesday, according to Principal David Legacki.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally we have about 4% or 5% absent," he said. Twenty-two
percent absent is rare, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still more were late.</TE>
<TE>   "If [the strike] goes on, it will be very disruptive," Legacki
said. "If a kid has math first period or science first period and he
has to learn an important lesson, when is he going to learn it?"</TE>
<TE>   Many parents had their fill of disruption Tuesday, as the strike
wreaked havoc on their work schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Celestine Lewis, of South-Central Los Angeles, got up at 4:50 a.m.
Tuesday so that her two teenage sons could catch the bus from 108th
Street and Van Ness Avenue to Taft High School in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The boys are bused to Taft because high schools in their area are
overcrowded.</TE>
<TE>   Usually they have to wait in the dark. Lewis worries about gangs
and drug dealers in the area and waits with them.</TE>
<TE>   After two hours, the bus was nowhere to be found, so Lewis
persuaded a friend to cover for her at the day-care center where she
works and drove her sons to school, about 35 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 175 of about 3,100 students were either late or absent
because of the strike, according to Taft Assistant Principal Margaret
Kearns.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the concerns of parents and students, Romer insisted at a
news conference at Cahuenga Elementary School that the district could
absorb the extra bus routes indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   The strike carries a cost for the district, however--about $75,000
a day in overtime to replacement drivers, said Antonio A. Rodriguez,
the district's transportation branch director. District officials
said they were prioritizing special education students and students
who attended schools that had scheduled Stanford-9 assessment tests
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Banned From Striking, Supervisors Take Over</TE>
<TE>   "One hundred [district-employed bus] supervisors are driving buses
today, and we have gone outside the district as well--including five
drivers from Downey," Romer said. "We will continue to put more
reserve drivers on tomorrow. All of these reserve drivers are
supervisors who are former drivers. They are fully licensed."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those supervisors are Teamsters members but do not work
for Laidlaw. Middleton called the workers "scabs" and said he was
"going to deal with those members personally in their face ...
possibly sometime tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   District officials, however, said those managers are under a
separate contract and are prohibited from joining the strike.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the district has 1,100 in-house drivers of its own,
who are with Service Employees International Union, Local 99. The
president of the union, Janett Humphries, said Tuesday that they
would not join the protest.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Means is one of those drivers. On Tuesday morning she drove
her usual special education students and then, "My supervisor called
me on my cell and asked me if I could do another route," Means said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty hectic in the morning," she said. "I was driving
down the street and kids were flagging me down, 'bus driver!'"</TE>
<TE>   If Laidlaw and union members disagree about how to resolve the
strike, they agree that the Los Angeles Unified School District has
made tensions worse.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw and union officials complained Tuesday that the school
system has used in-house drivers to pressure contractors to offer
lower bids.</TE>
<TE>   They also complained that the district hires away Laidlaw drivers
to avoid having to pay training expenses, which leaves the bus
company short-staffed.</TE>
<TE>   Then, when Laidlaw fails to cover all its routes because of high
turnover rates, the district fines the company $150 for every missed
route, both sides contended.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said the district does not mandate Laidlaw's pay rates or
"dictate their labor conditions."</TE>

<HD>A's Win in Ninth on Pena's Homer</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rookie Carlos Pena homered to lead off the bottom of the ninth
inning, lifting the Oakland Athletics over the Texas Rangers, 3-2,
Tuesday at Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   Pena sent a 1-1 pitch from Dan Miceli (0-1) to right-center field
over the 388-foot marker.</LD>
<LD>   Miceli had pitched a perfect eighth for the Rangers before facing
Pena.</LD>
<TE>   A's closer Billy Koch (1-0) got credit for the win despite giving
up Gabe Kapler's tying single with two out in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   The Athletics once again shut down Texas' power-packed lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Koch, who came to Oakland in a trade with Toronto in the
off-season, blew his first save opportunity with the A's.</TE>
<TE>   With a 2-1 lead, Koch walked Rafael Palmeiro, then gave up a
single to Ivan Rodriguez. Herbert Perry bunted into a forceout at
third and rookie Hank Blalock struck out before Kapler singled.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland's Tim Hudson allowed one run and four hits over 61/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson, who went 18-9 with a a 3.37 ERA last season, got a
standing ovation when he was pulled in the seventh after giving up a
run-scoring single to Rodriguez. The 26-year-old right-hander struck
out six and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   With no decision, Texas starter Kenny Rogers preserved his streak
at the Coliseum. The former Athletics pitcher has not lost in Oakland
since Aug. 7, 1994, going 17-0 in 31 games (30 starts).</TE>
<TE>   Rogers gave up two runs on three hits over five innings. He struck
out four and walked five.</TE>
<TE>   He hit A's leadoff batter Jeremy Giambi in the right forearm with
a pitch in the first inning. Frank Menechino walked, and an out later
David Justice tripled to give the A's a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Colangelo pinch hit for Giambi in the second inning, and then
replaced him in left field. The A's said Giambi had a contusion on
his arm.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time in as many days that a Ranger starter had
hit an Oakland batter with a pitch. In Monday's opener, Chan Ho Park
hit second baseman Randy Velarde on the left hand.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 7, Chicago 4--Mark McLemore and Mike Cameron drew
bases-loaded walks as the Mariners rallied for four runs in the
seventh inning against Chicago's bullpen to win at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox took a 4-3 lead in the top of the seventh on Kenny
Lofton's two-run single off Arthur Rhodes. But Chicago used five
pitchers in the bottom half as the Mariners sent 10 batters to the
plate. Lorenzo Barcelo (0-1) started the inning, and McLemore's walk
off Damaso Marte brought in Dan Wilson with the tying run. Bret
Boone's single off Bob Howry put the Mariners ahead 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Martinez's sacrifice fly drove in Ichiro Suzuki before
reliever Mike Porzio walked two for Seattle's final run of the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 9, Detroit 5--Greg Vaughn's two-out RBI single broke an
eighth-inning tie to help the Devil Rays win at St. Petersburg, Fla.,
before a season-opening crowd of 38,142 at Tropicana Field.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn broke a 5-5 tie after loser Juan Acevedo walked Steve Cox
intentionally to get to the Devil Rays' cleanup hitter. Ben Grieve
drew a bases-loaded walk to drive in another run and Bobby Smith
added a two-run double that glanced off pitcher Danny Patterson's
foot and rolled into shallow right field.</TE>

<HD>Angels Run the Show in 7-5 Win Over Indians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sure, opening day is a happening and the second game of the season is
not. But two words for those Angel fans who packed Edison Field for
the opening-day sellout and skipped Tuesday's game: Too bad.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels rewarded 20,055 of their most loyal fans--including
Paul Pressler, the Disney executive charged with running the
team--with an exciting first victory of the season. David Eckstein
scored three runs, and the Angels stole four bases in a 7-5 victory
over the Cleveland Indians that came without benefit of a home run.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to scratch and claw," outfielder Darin Erstad said.
"Especially in our division, the chances of us getting three hits in
a row are not in our favor."</LD>
<TE>   The rally monkey made its season debut in the sixth inning, with
the score tied, 4-4. Call it coincidence or call it primate power,
but in that inning Cleveland second baseman Ricky Gutierrez dropped
the pop fly that allowed Troy Glaus to score the winning run.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus doubled home two insurance runs in the seventh inning. Ben
Weber and Al Levine combined for three shutout innings in relief of
starter Kevin Appier, with Troy Percival recording the save despite
giving up a home run to Russell Branyan.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tremendous victory," Appier said. "We were stealing
bases left and right, manufacturing runs and knocking guys in."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels came out running and never slowed down. In the first
inning, Erstad singled. He stole second, took third on the first of
two throwing errors by Cleveland catcher Einar Diaz and scored on a
double by Tim Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, Eckstein lined an apparent double into left-center
field. But he never stopped running, willing his way into a triple,
and scored on a groundout by Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth, Adam Kennedy walked, stole second and scored on a
single by Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, Eckstein hustled to beat out an infield single,
then moved into scoring position by stealing second and taking third
on another error by Diaz.</TE>
<TE>   Appier exhausted himself in his Angel debut, requiring what
Manager Mike Scioscia called an "extraordinarily high" 106 pitches to
complete his five innings. This was not quite what the Angels had in
mind when they acquired Appier from the New York Mets for Mo Vaughn.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels were not losing when Appier left the game, and for
that they were grateful. He gave up four runs, two earned, in five
innings. Not terrific, perhaps, but better than Vaughn in his first
game with his new team: In the Mets' season opener, Vaughn went 0 for
5 with two strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Chairman Michael Eisner seldom appears at Edison Field or
the Arrowhead Pond anymore, but Pressler plans to use the executive
box frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is not close to selling the Angels or Mighty Ducks to
anyone, Donald Watkins included. Pressler is no longer intent on
replacing Tony Tavares as president of the teams and wants to try the
job himself first.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler, whose directive to win halted a proposed Erstad trade
and prompted the additions of Appier, Brad Fullmer and Aaron Sele, is
looking forward to a summer of watching the rejuvenated Angels and
fixing the woeful Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   He attended the Angels' opener Sunday and their second game
Tuesday, and he plans to attend the Ducks' game tonight. He said he
was not disappointed in Tuesday's small crowd, on a cold weeknight,
and was heartened by the opening-day sellout.</TE>
<TE>   "To come up here and see people pumped up and see that level of
enthusiasm is incredibly gratifying," he said. "But opening day does
not make for a season."</TE>

<LD>All-Star closer Troy Percival can touch 100 mph with his fastball,
blowing his signature pitch past hitters. On occasion, he turns to
his curveball, which tends to freeze hitters expecting a fastball
some 20 mph faster.</LD>
<LD>   By adding another pitch, Percival would almost seem to be greedy.
He seldom enters the game before the ninth inning, and a guy who
throws 10 to 20 pitches usually would not risk blowing one of them,
and potentially blowing a save, on his third-best pitch.</LD>
<LD>   That has not deterred Percival from working on a changeup this
spring. Not surprisingly, he started out throwing the pitch too hard,
but pitching coach Bud Black showed him a grip that allowed him to
reduce the pitch speed from 90 mph to 84 mph. The effectiveness of
the changeup rests in the ability to make it look like a fastball but
throw it markedly slower.</LD>
<TE>   "It's actually becoming a solid pitch for me now," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   Percival said he won't throw too many changeups, most likely using
the pitch on days he cannot command his curve. He said he threw the
pitch "four or five times" in games last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Until he uses it, we won't know how good it can become," Black
said. "He'll have to pick his spots with it."</TE>
<TE>   Donald Watkins, the Alabama businessman who has made preliminary
offers to purchase the Angels and Minnesota Twins, issued a statement
Tuesday confirming his pursuits. He did not identify the teams and
said he had signed confidentiality agreements that would make further
comment "inappropriate and impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins met with Disney executives March 22 and is believed to
have offered about $250 million for the Angels. He previously offered
Minnesota owner Carl Pohlad a reported $125 to $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox confirmed that Watkins met March 23 with Chicago
owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who is close to Commissioner Bud Selig.
Watkins has sought out influential individuals, in part for their
counsel and in part to offer assurances to owners skeptical about his
net worth, which he privately lists at $1.5 billion. But Forbes
magazine examined Watkins' business interests in banking and energy
and concluded "we have reason to doubt the number."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the editor, Watkins responded that Forbes was not
provided with personal financial information and said he had not
"asked the magazine to confirm my net worth."</TE>
<TE>   "In recent weeks, I have had several very positive discussions
with individuals involved in Major League Baseball," Watkins said in
his statement. "They have assured me that my goal to become an owner
of a Major League Baseball team is a concept which they look upon
with favor as they continue to process my application."</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Miller hits grand slam as Arizona stifles San
Diego again.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Right-hander Curt Schilling picked up where Randy Johnson left off by
pitching seven scoreless innings and Damian Miller hit a grand slam
Tuesday night as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the San Diego Padres,
9-0.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling, 26-6 last season counting his 4-0 postseason mark,
struck out nine, gave up six hits and didn't walk a batter one night
after teammate Johnson struck out eight and pitched a six-hitter in a
2-0 complete-game victory. Sixty of Schilling's 80 pitches were
strikes.</LD>
<LD>   The Diamondbacks received their World Series rings in a ceremony
before the game in front of a sellout crowd 48,042, then made quick
work of the Padres, who are 4-20 at Bank One Ballpark since 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Tony Womack singled, drove in two runs with sacrifice flies, and
made a leaping grab of Ramon Vazquez's line drive to end San Diego's
fifth inning. Junior Spivey was three for three with a double and
scored twice.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's fourth career slam capped a seven-run second inning for
the Diamondbacks against Brian Tollberg.</TE>
<TE>   Tollberg lasted only 22/3 innings. He gave up nine runs and nine
hits, walked three and struck out none.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Burroughs was in the lineup after missing Monday's opener
because of a stomach virus and got his first big-league hit with a
leadoff single in the fifth. He also singled in the seventh.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commissioner Bud Selig criticized a Forbes magazine report that major
league teams had an operating profit of $75 million last season--a
marked difference from the $232 million in operating losses that he
detailed to Congress in December.</LD>
<LD>   The magazine reported in its April 15 issue that 20 of the 30
teams were profitable last season--more than double what Selig said.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no way. Those numbers are fiction, they are pure
fiction," Selig said of the magazine's statistics.</LD>
<TE>   Forbes senior editor Mike Ozanian said he stands by the report.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony to the House Judiciary Committee in December, the
commissioner said the industry had $232 million in operating losses
last year and only nine teams had an operating profit.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Manfred, baseball's executive vice president of labor
relations, discussed baseball's finances with the magazine, Selig
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't give any validity to it," Selig said of the Forbes

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC Coach Henry Bibby acknowledged Tuesday that retired Fresno State
Coach Jerry Tarkanian approached him at the Final Four and inquired
about the possibility of finding a spot on Bibby's staff for his son,
Danny, who had been an assistant to his father in Fresno since 1995.</LD>
<LD>   "He asked me about it but I don't have an opening," Bibby said.
"Nobody's looking to go anywhere."</LD>
<LD>   Trojan assistants Kurtis Townsend, who is considered USC's top
recruiter, and Damon Archibald, whose focus is on defense, were
interested in head coaching vacancies at Long Beach State and Boise
State, respectively, but the positions have been filled.</LD>
<TE>   The elder Tarkanian, who won a national championship in 1990 at
Nevada Las Vegas, had hoped to leave the Fresno State reins to his
son upon retiring. But after seven frustrating and controversy-filled
seasons, the school's administration looked elsewhere and will
introduce Oklahoma assistant Ray Lopes as coach today.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby also took issue with a published report that had Bibby
asking Tarkanian for help in landing the Fresno State job.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not a story," Bibby said. "That's totally ridiculous."</TE>

<LD>With the Major League Baseball season underway, Dave Anderson of the
New York Times poses some questions. A sampling:</LD>
<LD>   * "Will the Cubs' Sammy Sosa, Moises Alou and Fred McGriff
threaten the record of 143 home runs by three sluggers on the same
team (Roger Maris 61, Mickey Mantle 54 and Bill Skowron 28 for the
1961 Yankees)?</LD>
<LD>   "Or will the Rangers' Alex Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro and Juan
Gonzalez threaten it?"</LD>
<TE>   More Anderson: "How long will Pirate third baseman Aramis Ramirez
(34 homers, 112 runs batted in, .300 average last season) remain
baseball's best-kept secret?"</TE>
<TE>   "Can the Diamondback aces, Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson, match
their 43-12 record last year?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the last repeat winner of the Masters?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Interest fading: Gene Frenette in the Florida Times-Union: "Chris
Berman opined at the start of [Monday's] Braves-Phillies game that
opening day in baseball is 'when everybody can feel like a kid
again.' No argument there. The problem, however, is that when most of
us were kids, baseball was something special the whole year round.
Not just once in a great while."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toy talk: Craig Kilborn of CBS'The Late Late Show was musing about
this: "In 'age-before-beauty' news, 87-year-old cloth doll Raggedy
Ann was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in Salem, Ore....</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, Ann's brother Raggedy Andy is ineligible for the
Toy Hall of Fame because he once bet on a game of Chutes and
Ladders."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A cooking show: Comedy writer Jerry Perisho was turned off by the
Maryland-Indiana NCAA title game Monday: "I saw so many turnovers, I
thought Martha Stewart was coaching against Emeril Lagasse.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting it in boxing terms, this game looked like Tonya Harding
vs. Paula Jones."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only 4-1? Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "British
bookmaker William Hill has posted some early odds on Mike Tyson's
June 8 fight with Lennox Lewis in Memphis, Tenn. Hill says Tyson is
4-1 to be disqualified."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More boxing: Comedy writer Alex Kaseberg in the San Francisco
Chronicle: "Tyson has as much of a chance to beat Lewis as Charles
Barkley does of being the honorary starter at the Masters
tournament."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Nick Faldo, who won in 1989 and '90, each time in a
playoff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All business: Linebacker Bryan Cox, who recently left Super Bowl
champion New England for the New Orleans Saints, had this analysis of
his former team: "[The Patriots were] not the most talented team I
have ever played on and it wasn't the closest team I ever played on.
Like other teams, the players had some differences.</TE>
<TE>   "But when it came to game time, we put everything aside and played
football. We beat the Rams because we outcoached them and outhit
them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Phil Mickelson, commenting on Tiger Woods: "He's the
best player in the world, but I'm not going to back down from him. I
see these other guys wilt, and it's just unbelievable to me that they
haven't been able to play their best golf when he's in contention."</TE>

<HD>Maggette Is Expected to Resume Starting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On second thought, Coach Alvin Gentry decided he would probably start
Corey Maggette at small forward tonight against the Utah Jazz.
Tremaine Fowlkes had been starting since Maggette dislocated two
bones in his right hand after punching the scorer's table Feb. 21 at
Orlando.</LD>
<LD>   Gentry said Monday he would continue to start Fowlkes, then
changed his mind. Maggette has played two games since he was
activated from the injured list and the Clippers, desperately needing
a jolt, will welcome back his hard-nosed style of play tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Fowlkes has averaged four points and 3.5 rebounds in 18 games, 17
of them starts. Maggette averages 10.8 points and 3.8 rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll get no complaints from Tremaine, I know that," Gentry said
of Fowlkes, signed from the National Basketball Development League on
Feb. 23. "He's done a great job for us. I think he's played pretty
consistently. We've talked to him about being more aggressive
offensively. [But] he's done what we've asked him to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers hope Fowlkes will join their summer league team
during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers expect Lamar Odom to undergo surgery on his sprained
right wrist next week. No date has been set but Gentry said the
procedure probably would be done within the next four or five days.</TE>
<TE>   Odom has been on the injured list since Jan. 24. He hurt his wrist
after a hard fall in the Clippers' victory Dec. 16 against the
Detroit Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   During his layoff, he also stepped on a stray ball while
attempting a dunk and sprained his right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Utah, 6 PST</TE>
<TE>   Site--Delta Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KSPN (1110) (7 p.m., delayed).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Clippers 37-37, Jazz 41-33.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Jazz--0-3.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Clippers have yet to win in 21 games at the Delta
Center. They also play Thursday against the Mavericks at Dallas on
this two-game trip. Power forward Elton Brand needs two more games
with 10 or more points and rebounds to match Swen Nater's franchise
record of 54 double-doubles in a season, set in 1980-81. Brand also
is closing in on Michael Cage's team record for offensive rebounds,
371 in 1987-88. Brand has a league-leading 358. The Jazz lost to the
Nuggets Tuesday at Denver.</TE>

<HD>New Deal Will Expand Costas' Role With HBO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Costas, once a candidate to work NBA telecasts for ABC and ESPN
beginning next season, has signed a new multiyear deal with HBO,
which would preclude him from working for another cable network.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, to be announced today, also means it is unlikely he
would be a part of ABC's NBA coverage, which involves 15
regular-season games and the Finals.</LD>
<LD>   ESPN, under parent company Disney's new contract with the NBA,
will do the bulk of the coverage and, according to a source, is
handling the hiring of on-air talent. AOL Time Warner has a separate
deal with the NBA, providing for coverage on TNT and a new channel,
tentatively to be the All Sports Network.</LD>
<TE>   "ESPN's offer was intriguing," Costas said Tuesday night. "It was
well thought out and geared toward my interest and strengths as a
broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   "It was substantial in every way and I considered it very
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Costas' new deal with HBO means he will continue to do his "On the
Record" show as well as appear on "Inside the NFL." He will also be
involved in specials and other HBO projects.</TE>
<TE>   "A little of this and that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Costas would not rule out the possibility of still doing some sort
of deal with ABC.</TE>
<TE>   "All this does is define the cable aspect, the network element is
still undecided," he said, leaving the door open to be possibly
involved in the NBA Finals on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Costas' NBC deal expires in June, and there has been speculation
that even if he were involved with ABC's NBA coverage he might still
serve as NBC's Olympic host in 2004, 2006 and 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Costas was reached in New York, where he was working on Thursday
night's edition of "On the Record," which will include an interview
Costas did with Jim Brown at the Ventura Country jail on Saturday. By
then Brown had been fasting for 17 days. Costas said that although
Brown had lost 20 pounds he looked good and was totally alert.</TE>
<TE>   "He believes he has been targeted by the D.A.'s office and police
because he is a political activist," Costas said.</TE>
<TE>   The other guest on Thursday's show will be Bud Selig, who will be
live in studio.</TE>

<HD>Trouble Right Off the Bat</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Bonds hits two home runs and Brown lasts only
four innings for Los Angeles as Giants coast to 9-2 victory before
sellout crowd at Dodger Stadium.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The top of the new-look Dodger order manufactured a few runs Tuesday,
as leadoff batter Dave Roberts and No. 2 hitter Cesar Izturis did
many of the little things Manager Jim Tracy said are critical for the
offense to click this season.</LD>
<LD>   Problem was, the San Francisco Giants were in mass-production
mode, turning Dodger ace Kevin Brown into the king of clubbed during
a 9-2 season-opening victory before a sellout crowd of 53,356 at
Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants rocked Brown for five runs and five hits in the second
inning, the capper a three-run, opposite-field home run by Barry
Bonds that broke up what appeared to be an entertaining fight in the
left-field pavilion.</LD>
<TE>   Bonds, who set a single-season record with 73 home runs last
season, later scattered a few fans in the second deck above right
field in the seventh, blasting a towering solo shot off reliever Omar
Daal to become only the 10th player in Dodger Stadium history to
homer into the loge level.</TE>
<TE>   "That guy's incredible," Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said of
Bonds. "If he keeps going like that, he's going to end up with 250
walks this year. That first home run wasn't where we wanted to throw
the pitch. The second home run wasn't a bad pitch on our part. He's
just incredible."</TE>
<TE>   The Bonds bombs highlighted a 12-hit Giant attack that featured an
RBI single in the second and a rally-sparking single in the fourth by
San Francisco starter Livan Hernandez, who wiped away an ugly spring
(35 earned runs in 30 innings) with an eight-inning, four-hit
performance in which he retired 14 in a row from the third through
seventh innings.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez and Brown were teammates on the Florida Marlins' 1997
World Series-champion team, but they were hardly equals Tuesday.
Hernandez was poised throughout, locating his pitches on both
corners, rarely allowing a hard-hit ball and also avoiding big
innings. Trouble was Brown's business.</TE>
<TE>   He lasted only four innings, giving up seven runs and nine hits,
striking out five and walking one. He threw 69 pitches, 46 for
strikes, many in prime hitting zones as opposed to the corners or at
the knees.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is six months removed from surgery to repair a torn flexor
muscle in his elbow, and there have been questions all spring as to
whether his rehabilitation was rushed, and whether he was ready to
start the season. Brown scoffed at such suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   "If I gave up 27 line drives that were all hit right at somebody,
you guys would think I pitched great," Brown told reporters
afterward. "If I feel I can go, what am I going to do, sit around and
not pitch? I've done everything I can do [to prepare for the season].
There's no reason why, physically, I shouldn't be on the mound."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy said he has "no concerns whatsoever" about
Brown's elbow, and Brown, who entered with an 8-1 career record and
1.86 earned-run average in 12 starts against the Giants, said his
elbow "felt fine--no excuses."</TE>
<TE>   But this was not vintage Kevin Brown on the Dodger Stadium mound
Tuesday, and that doesn't bode well for a rotation that has another
starter, Andy Ashby, coming back from the same surgery, and one,
Kazuhisa Ishii, whose control problems are becoming a huge concern.</TE>
<TE>   Brown gave up consecutive one-out singles to David Bell, Pedro
Feliz and Hernandez for a run in the second, and Rich Aurilia's
run-scoring single made it 2-1. Bonds then tore into a 93-mph
fastball, sending it into the seats above the left-field wall for a
three-run homer and a 5-1 lead. Bell homered to left in the third for
a 6-1 lead, and Bonds' run-scoring single in the fourth made it 7-2.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing when you don't give your team a chance," Brown
said. "I pretty much buried us."</TE>
<TE>   His teammates were not about to do the same to Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he wished he had some pain [in his elbow] so he would
have an excuse," Lo Duca said. "His stuff was fine. It just wasn't in
the right spot. He's too good a competitor to take this into his next
outing. I think he'll be fine.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't surprise me if he came out next time and threw a
one-hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Jim Colborn wasn't making any bold predictions, but
he is confident better days lie ahead for Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see this as any kind of call to doom," Colborn said. "We
will watch him continue to improve as the season goes along."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez couldn't pitch much better, though his day got off to an
uncomfortable start. As he warmed up in the right-field bullpen, fans
hurled a barrage of profanities and insults at the right-hander,
according to pitching coach Dave Righetti.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scored a run in the first when Roberts singled, stole
second, took third on Izturis' bunt and came home on Lo Duca's
groundout. Hernandez walked three in the second but escaped with the
help of catcher Benito Santiago, who threw out Adrian Beltre, who was
inexplicably trying to steal second despite a 5-1 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts doubled and scored on Lo Duca's double-play grounder in
the third, but Hernandez was untouchable from that point. Perhaps his
best pitch was a 72-mph curve that Beltre bailed out on and took for
strike three in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a tough warmup; he was getting crushed out there,"
Righetti said. "But he held his composure great. I knew he'd do well
today. He survived the first-inning jitters and was fine the rest of
the way."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Giants' Request Denied</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Giants and Dodgers have staged one of baseball's most hotly
contested rivalries for decades, and the action isn't confined to the
field.</LD>
<LD>   Last season, Giant officials were miffed when the Dodgers refused
to take part in a re-enactment of Bobby Thomson's three-run home run
off Ralph Branca that gave the Giants the 1951 National League
pennant over the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers also rankled the Giants when they would not agree to
stop the game for a ceremony honoring San Francisco slugger Barry
Bonds if Bonds broke Mark McGwire's single-season home run record at
Dodger Stadium last season.</LD>
<TE>   The teams were at it again this week. The Giants asked the Dodgers
to move Thursday's 7 p.m. game to 1 p.m. so the Giants, who have a
1:15 p.m. home opener against San Diego on Friday, could return to
San Francisco at a reasonable hour Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers refused, and when the Giants asked them to move the
game up an hour, to 6 p.m., they got the same answer: No.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem," said Larry Baer, executive vice president of the
Giants, "is we'll probably get home at 2 a.m. [Friday morning] and
have to play at 1 p.m. the next day."</TE>
<TE>   Derrick Hall, Dodger senior vice president of communications, said
moving the game would cut too deep into television ratings and
attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "To have two day games during a week school is still in session
would make it too difficult for families to come to games," Hall
said. "We considered it. We just couldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Baer said the disagreement "wasn't a huge deal," but he
acknowledged it added to the frosty relations between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   "The funny thing is I get along well with [Dodger Chairman] Bob
Daly and [President] Bob Graziano, we talk a lot about baseball
matters," Baer said. "We just can't agree on specific things."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Roberts made a good first impression in his Dodger debut
Tuesday. The center fielder, who beat out Marquis Grissom, McKay
Christensen and Tom Goodwin for the job, singled, stole second and
scored in the first inning and doubled and scored in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Both times, Roberts advanced to third on Cesar Izturis bunts, for
a sacrifice in the first inning and a single in the third, giving
affirmation to the little-ball style and the aggressive approach
Manager Jim Tracy has stressed all spring.</TE>
<TE>   But the Giants scored five runs in the second, and the Dodgers
managed only five hits on the day, a combination that sapped whatever
enthusiasm the Dodgers might have had in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the first inning started, that was great, it was just
like everyone scripted this spring, everything we hoped for," Dodger
first baseman Eric Karros said. "Hopefully, innings like that will
continue for us. I think that will happen more often than Kevin Brown
giving up five runs in one inning."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts hopes he and the speedy Izturis will bring an energy to
the top of the order that the rest of the lineup can feed off.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the long haul," Roberts said, "if we continue to do things
like that, we'll end up with more wins than losses."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Giant shortstop Rich Aurilia singled in the first and second
innings and now has seven consecutive hits off Brown.... The Dodgers
agreed to terms on minor league contracts with catcher Todd Greene, a
former Angel who was released by the New York Yankees this spring,
shortstop Felix Martinez, who was released by Tampa Bay, and
outfielder Scott Pose, who was released by Houston.</TE>

<HD>Ishii Still a Starter for a Wild</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Although puzzled by left-hander's control
problems, Dodgers say he remains in rotation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers said Tuesday that struggling pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii's
command problems bewilder them, but he's still in the starting
rotation. At least for a while.</LD>
<LD>   The wild left-hander is scheduled to pitch Saturday against the
Colorado Rockies at Dodger Stadium, though Manager Jim Tracy said the
club would "continue to take a close look at the situation." Tracy
was noncommittal about whether Ishii--who walked seven batters in
only 22/3 innings in his final exhibition start--would be sent to the
bullpen if he had another disappointing outing.</LD>
<LD>   This is not how the Dodgers envisioned Ishii beginning his first
major league season after a standout 10-year career in Japan.</LD>
<TE>   "Put this in the paper: He will be [successful]," Tracy said after
the San Francisco Giants' 9-2 opening-day victory before a sellout
crowd of 53,356 at Dodger Stadium. "You can't pitch the way this guy
pitched in Japan and not be able to climb that hurdle over here. And
this is not a one game-proposition for us, but we need to get to the
bottom of this and figure out what the hell is going on.</TE>
<TE>   "If we knew what was causing [Ishii's anxiety] we would have
solved the problem already. That's really the only question that we
have to get answered because he has outstanding stuff. I had him in
my office the other day with [pitching coach Jim Colborn] to just
talk to him and try to get him to relax, but we're still trying to
figure out exactly what it is. We need to relieve the anxiety and
we're working on it."</TE>
<TE>   The process has been much slower than Ishii and the Dodgers would
prefer.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans bid $11.26 million to negotiate with
Ishii, then gave him a four-year, $12.2-million contract. The Dodgers
decided not to re-sign talented right-hander Chan Ho Park, their top
starter last season, in part because they were pursuing Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   Evans cited Ishii's performance in last season's Japan Series
Championship--he pitched eight shutout innings with 12 strikeouts
while helping the Yakult Swallows to the title--in describing him as
a "big-game pitcher." Colborn raised the bar even higher before Ishii
had thrown a pitch in the big leagues, saying, "He's a scaled-down
version of Randy Johnson," the Arizona Diamondbacks' four-time Cy
Young Award winner.</TE>
<TE>   Then Ishii had a 13.33 earned-run average in 81/3 exhibition
innings and couldn't throw strikes consistently. In a 6-3 loss to the
Seattle Mariners on Sunday at Safeco Field, Ishii gave up five runs,
four hits, walked seven--among them five consecutive batters in the
third--and hit a batter.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said the Dodgers have not discussed putting Ishii in the
bullpen, but that's where the club's biggest off-season acquisition
could soon be headed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's self-induced pressure," Ishii said through an interpreter.
"I'm putting pressure on myself, and I must have confidence to have
success. It's a tiny bit stressful that I'm not able to play the way
I know I'm able to play."</TE>
<TE>   For the Dodgers too.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there a huge problem with him? No. Is he perfect right now?
No. But we know he's going to be OK," Evans said. "We're fully
committed to this guy. You can't expect perfection, particularly in
the last outing in spring training. There are a lot of guys who
struggle in spring training, and then once the season starts and it
counts it's a whole lot different."</TE>
<TE>   Although it seems Ishii's problems are more mental than
mechanical, the Dodgers have not encouraged him to consult a sports
psychologist. It's a delicate situation and they're treading lightly.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a bullpen [session] today, and he seemed more focused and
determined than he had been," Colborn said. "I don't know if this is
the case, but it could be that his [only] goal had been to come to
America. Now, I think he's realizing he has to prepare to compete."</TE>

<HD>Sharks Stop Ducks Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>The Ducks lost for the fifth time in seven games as Adam Graves had a
goal and an assist and Evgeni Nabokov stopped 25 shots Tuesday night
as the San Jose Sharks prevailed, 3-1.</LD>
<LD>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere stopped 27 shots as the Ducks, the Pacific
Division's last-place team, lost for the eighth time in their last 10
meetings with the Sharks.</LD>
<LD>   Captain Owen Nolan had three assists, while Vincent Damphousse and
Patrick Marleau also scored as the Sharks reclaimed sole possession
of first place in the Pacific Division with their fourth victory in
six games.</LD>
<TE>   The victory pushed San Jose (40-25-8-3, 91 points) ahead of
Phoenix (37-24-9-6, 89 points) in the division race. The surprising
Coyotes, who visit San Jose on Thursday, have emerged as the biggest
obstacle in the Sharks' quest for the first division title in
franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose didn't need much offense to back Nabokov, who had lost
four of his previous six decisions.</TE>
<TE>   With his 33rd victory, Nabokov broke the franchise record he
established last season. Though he lost the chance at his eighth
shutout on Sami Pahlsson's goal with 40 seconds to play, Nabokov made
several spectacular saves--including a point-blank stop of Steve
Rucchin earlier in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose has three victories in the first four games of a six-game
homestand. The Sharks also beat the Ducks for the fourth time in five
meetings this season.</TE>
<TE>   After matching a franchise record with 10 goals in their last game
against Columbus, the Sharks proved they can thrive in a
close-checking defensive game as well.</TE>
<TE>   Graves scored an opportunistic goal just 1:52 into the second
period after Nolan threaded a long centering pass into Anaheim's
crease. Standing in front, Graves tapped the rebound past Giguere for
his 16th goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Damphousse got his 19th goal of the season 7:22 into the third.
Marleau, who has eight points in his last four games, added a late
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Teemu Selanne had an assist against his former team.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Duck defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky missed his fourth
consecutive game because of a groin injury.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Eit- her Michael Jordan's comeback has encountered difficult times or
he's switching sports and entering the Tour de France.</LD>
<LD>   These are strange days for Jordan, now a Wizard reserve at age 38
and coming off the bench gingerly, too, after warming up his
recently-'scoped left knee by pedaling away on a stationary bike that
has been hauled near the bench for him, as if he's Joe Schmo at the
Y.</LD>
<LD>   Nor do the bike, the knee or the magic work the way they used to.
Try a career-low two points in Tuesday night's 113-93 wipeout at the
hands of the Lakers, in a career-low 12 minutes. And this is a
14-year career we're talking about.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, his spirits are great. He's still out there
nightly, subjecting himself to every indignity and embarrassment
without complaint or compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Pretty it ain't, but what could be neater than that?</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough when you're going against the best and you don't have
the same equipment to go against them in a sense," he said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   " ... This is not the same team I played with in '98. People are
still trying to compare me to that team and it's not there. This is
not the [Bulls] team. I don't look over and I see [Scottie] Pippen or
[Dennis] Rodman or those guys. It's a lot of young players here and
I've accepted that fact.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that when I decided to come here. I understand the
comparisons and the questions and whatever but I know this is a
different time."</TE>
<TE>   This is a way different time. Once Jordan and Phil Jackson won
titles together. Tuesday, Jackson was making sure Devean George
stayed on the floor against that pump-fake that Jordan tries on
everyone these days, then acknowledging how painful it is to see
Jordan go through this ("You know, he's rehabilitating, too, probably
about four hours a day, if not more.")</TE>
<TE>   This was supposed to be a big game for the Wizards, or their last
stand, 21/2 games out of the No. 8 slot with time running out, and,
let's face it, reason for hope.</TE>
<TE>   Since Jordan's return--ahead of schedule--from his 'scope, he had
failed to score 12 points in five of his six games, including
Sunday's loss here to the Mavericks, after which Coach Doug Collins
said Mike had been playing "on one leg."</TE>
<TE>   Said Collins before Tuesday's game:</TE>
<TE>   "He probably rushed back as it was. He came back because he looked
at our schedule and said, 'When are we going to practice?'</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't going to be able to practice. So he said, 'OK, I'm
going to play minutes in a game and I'll pick it up as we go along.'</TE>
<TE>   "I think what's happened, his leg has stayed irritated. The damage
is out but any time you go into a joint, there's irritation.... I
think he knew if he was going to play, it wasn't going to be the way
he wanted it to be. But he wants to play.</TE>
<TE>   "You know him well enough, he's not going to back away from a
challenge, he's going to go down swinging and fighting. As long as
there's life and oxygen in his body, and as long as we got a
mathematical chance to make the playoffs ... "</TE>
<TE>   Little remains now but a mathematical chance, but the Wiz is still
going after it, which is why, with the Lakers up, 66-49, at the half,
and the Wizards playing tonight in Milwaukee, Collins and Jordan
decided to shut Mike down for the night.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was asked afterward if he'd ever felt they were competing
with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," he said, grinning, "the first three minutes. Then I think
they just separated the men from the boys. I think to some degree,
some of the [Wizard] players might have been in awe of their
players."</TE>
<TE>   Amazing as it may seem, Jordan confidantes still think he'll be
back next season, citing his plans to have his other knee 'scoped
over the summer, his ongoing desire to play and the fact he won't
like going out this way.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, everyone will be sure that playing next season
would be a terrible idea, and nothing motivates Jordan like a chance
to prove everyone wrong.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, how about this for a picture of devotion, this
living legend climbing on a stationary bike, on which his personal
trainer has placed a towel and a cup or water, right out in front of
everyone, because that's the price he has to pay for one more night
in his beloved "game of basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Becoming, it ain't. Admirable it is, though, through and through.</TE>

<LD>While Santa Anita is heading into its final three weeks, Bay Meadows
is just getting started.</LD>
<LD>   The track in San Mateo will begin its 55-day meet today and there
wasn't exactly a stampede to the entry box.</LD>
<LD>   The average field size for the eight races was seven and only one
race, the sixth, drew more than eight runners.</LD>
<TE>   What will be interesting at Bay Meadows is to see if jockey Jason
Lumpkins can give perennial riding king Russell Baze a run for his
money in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   Baze ran away with the championship at Golden Gate Fields, winning
159 races, 88 more than runner-up Jose Arriaga.</TE>
<TE>   However, Lumpkins, who finished third in the standings despite
missing a majority of the meet, has been sizzling of late and arrives
at Bay Meadows with some momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Both riders will be busy today. Baze is named on horses in seven
races; Lumpkins is scheduled to ride all but the second and sixth.</TE>
<TE>   With the start of Bay Meadows, bettors in California will now be
able to designate an alternate selection in the pick four if one of
their original choices is scratched.</TE>
<TE>   Before today, players were stuck with the race favorite if their
pick was scratched.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Although it drew only six runners, the second at
Santa Anita is an interesting starter allowance race at 11/4 miles on
the turf. Arbiter, who won two in a row for trainer Craig Lewis
earlier in the meet, will be making his grass debut against old pros
Soul Warrior, Nates Colony and Sharp Play.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Arromanches. The 9-year-old--whose 10-race winning
streak ended in his only start for trainer Arthur Wendel, who hasn't
won a race since the spring of 2000--got back on the beam Saturday at
Aqueduct. Arromanches won by a nose after rejoining the barn of
trainer Scott Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Gary Sciacca. The trainer, who has horses in Florida
and New York, is 3 for 74 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Collection in the
third, using all in the fourth and singling Rock Cod Johnny in the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/195. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $28.20/$1,154.20. Total money bet: $1,202.</TE>

<HD>Return to the Lineup Enough for Belanger</HD>

<LD>Eric Belanger didn't really care that he opened Tuesday night's game
against Vancouver skating on the King's fourth line because he was
happy just to get back on the ice.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm so excited," Belanger said after he was taken off the injured
list Tuesday morning after missing the previous 29 games following
surgery to his left wrist. "I feel like a kid in a candy store....
Waiting has been tough, that's the part of the game that people don't
see with professional athletes."</LD>
<LD>   Belanger, who had eight goals and 22 points in 46 games at the
time he suffered his injury Jan. 15 against Nashville, skated on a
line with Kelly Buchberger and Adam Mair. King Coach Andy Murray said
he plans to bring back Belanger slowly, which is fine with the
second-year center.</LD>
<TE>   "I will always give 100% when I step on the ice but it's going to
take a little while for me to get back to where I was before I got
injured," Belanger said. "I just have to pace myself."</TE>
<TE>   After leading all NHL rookies in winning percentage last season,
Belanger ranked among the league leaders this season before he was
hurt. It's a skill that he hopes to help the Kings with during their
stretch run.</TE>
<TE>   "I took a few [faceoffs] before Tuesday," Belanger said. "But the
best thing is to get back on the ice in games and take them. But I'm
pretty confident. Faceoffs is not something that you lose."</TE>
<TE>   To help make room for Belanger, Murray made right wing Steve
Heinze, without a goal in 25 games, a healthy scratch for the fourth
time since March 7.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the season, Heinze was one of the Kings' top
offensive threats with six goals and 12 points in 15 games. But since
then, Heinze has struggled.</TE>

<HD>Kings Losing Playoff Grip</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Vancouver erases L.A.'s lead with two goals late in
third period in a 4-4 tie at Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes a tie can feel like a victory and there are other times
when it's like a defeat.</LD>
<LD>   Based on how the Kings were booed off the ice after a 4-4 tie with
the Vancouver Canucks, it was easy to tell how Tuesday night's game
ended for the home team in front of a sellout Staples Center crowd of
18,118.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings blew a two-goal lead late in the third period and had to
hang on for their playoff lives in overtime. With the point, the
Kings' winless streak reached five games and their 87 points moved
them into a tie with Edmonton for sixth place in the Western
Conference.</LD>
<TE>   Philippe Boucher, Mathieu Schneider and Mikko Eloranta each scored
power-play goals for the Kings, who were three of five with a man
advantage. That normally would have been good enough for a victory,
but the Kings' penalty-killing unit continued to struggle by giving
up three power-play goals.</TE>
<TE>   King goaltender Felix Potvin gave up goals to Ed Jovanovski and
Markus Naslund 64 seconds apart in the final 2:30 of the third
period. The goals came on shots that Potvin probably would love to
see again as the Kings failed to hold on to a point they can only
hope doesn't come back to haunt them in their drive for a playoff
berth.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been very tough to leave here without any points,"
Naslund said about the Canucks, who moved ahead of Dallas with 84
points. "It was a situation where our season would have been over. We
didn't let that happen. I think you can tell by the desperate play we
had at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Only two weeks ago, there would have been no way that the Kings
gave up two power-play goals in a period, let alone three in a game.
But after having the best penalty-killing unit in the league that had
given up more than two power-play goals in a game only once in their
first 72 games, the Kings have had more than their share of problems
when short-handed.</TE>
<TE>   They gave up three power-play goals in games at Vancouver and
Calgary last week and three against the Canucks Tuesday. The Kings
are 0-3-2-0 in their last five games.</TE>
<TE>   "We made some poor decisions, Mark [Hardy] does a great job of
preparing them," King Coach Andy Murray said about the Kings'
struggling penalty killers. "It is simplistic to say it was poor
execution on our part and a good power play by the Vancouver Canucks.
I don't think our players got dumb or we got dumb as coaches over the
last week."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings grabbed a 1-0 lead 76 seconds into the first period on
Adam Deadmarsh's 27th goal, thanks to a great cross-ice pass from
Ziggy Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings continued to control the flow until Vancouver went on a
power-play at the 7:22 mark, thanks to a board check by King
defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky. It didn't take the Canucks long to tie
the score.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Mattias Norstrom had his clearing attempt kept in the
King zone by Jovanovski and he found an open Todd Bertuzzi in front
of the net. Bertuzzi beat Potvin for his 32nd goal at 7:29.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver kept up the pressure and it resulted in a 2-1 lead on
another power-play goal from behind the King net, Bertuzzi finding
Henrik Sedin outside the right post for his 15th goal.</TE>
<TE>   With Palffy leading the charge, the Kings regained control in the
second period and tied the score, 2-2, on a power-play goal from
Boucher at 15:46.</TE>
<TE>   King forward Bryan Smolinski, who has been one step out of
Murray's doghouse for a lack of offensive production, played one of
his better games. He set up Boucher's goal with a strong move to the
net. Smolinski had two shots stopped by Dan Cloutier but the
Vancouver goalie could not block Boucher on the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   In the third period, Schneider scored his seventh goal when he had
his power-play shot from the point slightly deflected by a Canuck
defender and past Cloutier, who was screened by two Kings in front of
him at 5:01.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings then took a 4-2 lead when Eloranta scored L.A.'s third
power-play goal, thanks to another perfect assist from Palffy, who
found his teammate in front of the crease at 10:55.</TE>
<TE>   But that only set the stage for the Kings' collapse.</TE>

<HD>Jordan: Kobe Is Evolving</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant walked away from MCI Center with his father, Joe, on
Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant did not stop to talk to reporters after a 113-93 victory
over the Washington Wizards, but at least one observer clearly
believed Bryant's game is evolving.</LD>
<LD>   Occasionally accused of patterning his game after Michael
Jordan's, Bryant used to telephone Jordan in order to seek NBA
truths. Apparently, that has changed.</LD>
<TE>   "He doesn't have to pick my brain," Jordan said. "He's already
learned a lot. I don't want to give up any of my secrets either. But,
the kid is growing. I've given him some information. He's with a good
coach, who's going to help him learn and keep him focused. But when
we talk, we basically talk as friends."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey Net forward Kenyon Martin was ineligible to play
against the Lakers a month ago because of a league suspension for a
flagrant foul.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the rematch between the Nets and Lakers, here's what
you need to know about Martin's rehabilitative potential: He not only
returned from that suspension, but two others since. He has missed
eight games because of five suspensions, all due to flagrant fouls.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's being excessive," Samaki Walker said. "I think he's
trying to make a name for himself. It's a matter of time before
someone lets him know he's gone too far."</TE>
<TE>   Martin said Tuesday that he would not hesitate to deliver his
signature hard fouls--dirty, perhaps--on Shaquille O'Neal or any of
the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd better be careful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker consultant Jerry West, on his way to Virginia for the
Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, attended the game after lunching

<HD>No Drama for Lakers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: With Jordan scoring a career-low two
points, L.A. cruises past the Wizards, 113-93.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Lakers steadied themselves, and Michael Jordan never came.</LD>
<LD>   They peeked into the shadows at the end of the Washington Wizard
bench, and Michael Jordan never rose.</LD>
<LD>   They saved their legs and their minds and if he were ready, then
so they hoped to be. He was not, however, and they won, 113-93,
without a great effort on Tuesday night at MCI Center, where Jordan
scored two points in 12 minutes, circumstance and injury causing the
lowest totals of an astonishing career.</LD>
<TE>   "It was, I mean, it didn't seem like he had the lift, or a lot of
energy, tonight," said Laker forward Devean George, who defended
Jordan. "He was dragging his leg, it looked like.</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't going to take credit. I caught him when he was on his
downfall."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks out of knee surgery but four days after putting 34
points on the Milwaukee Bucks, Jordan missed four of five shots, all
in the second quarter. He did not play in the second half, as the
Laker lead grew to 25 points in the third quarter, and to 28 in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Jordan shrugged at the loss, at his own dismal numbers,
at the kind of game once thought impossible, in any circumstance.
Coach Doug Collins had asked him at halftime to consider resting if
the Wizards, who played the first of four games in five nights and
remain playoff eligible, did not draw close to the Lakers, and Jordan
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not chasing anything," he said. "I'm not chasing stats."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "I had no pain," though he played with a long black
sleeve on his right leg.</TE>
<TE>   It left a young and under-talented team against the Lakers, who
have won six of seven games. Twenty-four hours before they would play
the New Jersey Nets--and already 10 of their 21 losses have come in
the second of back-to-back games--the Lakers took the big lead and
the easy baskets without quarrel.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal, free against the soft Wizard interior, scored 22
points and took 18 rebounds, matching his season high, in 31 minutes.
Kobe Bryant scored eight points in the first quarter, six in the
second and finished with those 14 in a light 33 minutes. Rick Fox and
Derek Fisher each scored 15.</TE>
<TE>   Ty Lue, the former Laker, grinned ruefully and said, "Shaq didn't
even want to play tonight, and he got 22 and 18 just going through
the motions."</TE>
<TE>   He had little opposition. Jordan rode a stationary bike for half
of the first quarter and then sat by the scorer's table with Lue
until 3:17 was left in the period. He did not attempt a shot until
early in the second quarter, when he missed a 17-foot jumper, and
then made an 18-footer nearly two minutes into the quarter, after
deftly pump-faking George off the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Forced into jump shots by George and Brian Shaw, Jordan scored
only once.</TE>
<TE>   As the minutes passed in the third quarter, and when the lanky,
elegant figure crossed his arms and stretched his legs ahead of him,
it became clear he would let this one go.</TE>
<TE>   "I hadn't seen him since he had the operation," Laker Coach Phil
Jackson said. "It looked to me like he wasn't as strong ... as he'd
like to be. I'm not going to judge anything from one night. Some
nights are just that way."</TE>
<TE>   They never were before, of course, but this is different, and the
Lakers, finally, were grateful. They remained two losses behind the
Pacific Division- and Western Conference-leading Sacramento Kings,
who beat the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night with similar
authority.</TE>
<TE>   No matter the result of the regular season, Jordan said, he knew
the favorite when he saw it.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are attempting to become the fifth team to three-peat,
the first since Jordan's Chicago Bulls did it twice in the last
decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a firm believer [the Lakers] are the best team until they get
beat," he said. "Until you can win in June, you can't knock the king
off the hill."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday ended an odd period for Jackson, who coached against and
through Scottie Pippen and Jordan, the foundation of six
championships in Chicago, in the course of five days.</TE>
<TE>   His emotions, Jackson said, were alike. But, Pippen was a more
difficult coaching assignment, given his attention to the details on
the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very similar," he said. "Scottie's a little more tuned in
and ... disruptive. But, that's the nature of who he is ... as a
freelancer.''</TE>

<HD>Golfers' Children Handled With Care</HD>
<DH>LPGA: With 30 mothers on tour, traveling preschool has been
popular since it began in 1993. Some say they couldn't continue
playing without it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One usually doesn't think of sports and child care as going hand in
hand, but when it comes to women's professional golf, child care is a
major concern.</LD>
<LD>   There are 30 moms on the LPGA Tour, with 47 children.</LD>
<LD>   So maybe it's not surprising that the LPGA has pioneered in
providing child care for its members. Since 1993, it has had a
traveling preschool, the LPGA Child Development Center. Children
eligible to attend the center are between 10 months and 5 years and
there are typically 10 or so of them at each tournament.</LD>
<TE>   The auditorium at the Discovery Children's Museum in Rancho Mirage
last week was filled with such things as storage cubby holes bearing
children's names, a colorful playroom rug, toddler-sized table and
chairs, and easels for arts and crafts. Also in evidence were a
television, a VCR and a stereo. And a diaper-changing table.</TE>
<TE>   A conference room at a hotel in the San Fernando Valley looks very
much the same this week.</TE>
<TE>   The equipment, loaded in a bobtail truck, goes wherever there is
an LPGA tournament in the United States, which amounts to about 30
tournaments a year.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the center was located near the Mission Hills Country
Club, site of the Kraft Nabisco Championship. This week it's not far
from El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana, site of the Office Depot
Championship, a 54-hole tournament that begins Friday with Amy Alcott
as host.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of going off to a job, the moms who drop off their kids go
off to play golf. The cost is partially absorbed by a sponsor, the
J.M. Smucker Co., so the moms pay around $100 a week. The cost
varies, depending on the age of the child, and sure beats bringing
along a full-time nanny.</TE>
<TE>   "If it weren't for the center, I couldn't play professional golf
and also have a child," Danielle Ammaccapane said. "I couldn't afford
it. It would either be have a child and quit the tour or don't have a
child."</TE>
<TE>   Ammaccapane and her husband, Rod Kesling, have a daughter, Laura
Ann, who was born Feb. 25, 2000. Ammaccapane earned $252,000 last
year on the tour but made less than $50,000 each of the previous two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA's day-care center was the first in professional sports,
and since then other sports organizations, such as the PGA, NASCAR
and CART, have followed suit.</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA center was started by Tony Verive, 55, a former building
contractor in Indio who went back to school and became a specialist
in early childhood education when the construction business slumped
in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Verive, who already had a master's degree in philosophy from
Arizona State, got a degree in early childhood education from the
College of the Desert. In 1991, he was the lead teacher at the
college's preschool and also a Head Start teacher for the Palm
Springs Unified School District when he volunteered to help out with
day-care duties at what was then the Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament.</TE>
<TE>   After Verive had volunteered for the same duty in 1992, the moms
and the kids became so fond of him that at the end of the year the
LPGA came to him with a plan: How about a traveling preschool?</TE>
<TE>   Verive wound up with a new full-time job. He works seven long days
a week during the golf season, although he'll take a week off every
fourth or fifth week while his assistant, Ruth Peterson, takes
charge.</TE>
<TE>   Verive, who is single but has a 33-year-old daughter, loves
working with the kids. He's not as fond of the travel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nightmare," he said. "Loading up the equipment, going from
site to site, waiting for the truck to arrive, unloading the truck
and setting up the center--it becomes pretty hectic. That's the hard
part about the job."</TE>
<TE>   Verive said being away from home up to 10 months a year is also
tough.</TE>
<TE>   Verive usually travels on Sunday to the next site to start setting
things up, although the truck with the equipment doesn't usually
arrive until the next day.</TE>
<TE>   At each site, there are volunteers who help out. In Rancho Mirage,
Carol Collins, a grandmother of two, has been assisting Tony since
1994. Rose Marie Mentor, who has six grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren, was volunteering for a fourth year.</TE>
<TE>   With fewer than 10 children at the center, they were getting a lot
of individual attention.</TE>
<TE>   When a visitor walked in, Verive was busy changing a diaper.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll excuse me if I don't shake your hand," he said. "I don't
think you want to do that right now."</TE>
<TE>   Verive quickly wrapped things up. It was obvious that he is as
adept at changing diapers as the moms are at hitting golf balls.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a professional at this," he said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how many diapers he changes in a day, Verive said, "At the
Legends in Franklin, Tenn., last year, Ruth and I changed 45. I think
that's the record."</TE>
<TE>   But Verive's job is a lot more than baby-sitting and diaper
changing.</TE>
<TE>   A typical day at the center for the kids includes play-acting,
working on a computer, lunch, watching a video, nap time, arts and
crafts and reading.</TE>
<TE>   "He has got them in a very structured routine," said Pat Hurst,
whose son Jackson will be 3 in June. "He's just a wonderful person,
someone we can trust implicitly with our kids.</TE>
<TE>   "After Tony gets through with the kids, they are just so
well-behaved and so smart, it is unbelievable. The kids are so far
ahead of other kids their age they're almost too far advanced.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us peace of mind, our kids are in such good hands."</TE>
<TE>   Carin Koch, a former University of Tulsa star from Sweden who has
been on the tour since 1995, said, "What's obvious is that Tony loves
the kids. And they love him."</TE>
<TE>   Koch, whose son Oliver is 3, and other LPGA moms say the center is
a blessing and has made the decision to have children easier for them
and their husbands.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the center, you'd have to have a full-time nanny," Koch
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most husbands travel with their wives, but in most cases they're
not there to serve as a nanny. They're there to offer support, and
sometimes caddie.</TE>
<TE>   The center allows them to do that.</TE>
<TE>   Catrin Nilsmark, a Swede who played college golf at South Florida,
said, "It's really ideal. The kids make friends among themselves and
they get to meet people from all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   Nilsmark's daughter, Tuva, is 4.</TE>
<TE>   Denise Killeen stopped by the center to pick up her son, Drew, 4.</TE>
<TE>   "Drew loves coming here to see Tony," Killeen said. "He always
asks when he gets to come again. He can't wait. Tony really is like a
second father to these kids."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the mothers were a little leery in the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't use it at first," says Juli Inkster, whose children
Hayley and Cori are graduates of the center. "But as I learned more
about it, I felt more comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   These days, the moms on tour can rest easy and concentrate on
their games. They know their little ones are in good hands, and the
cost of day care isn't going to take a big chunk of their winnings.</TE>

<HD>Fourth-Quarter Rally Lifts Celtics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Pierce and the Boston Celtics think they can come back from any
kind of deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce scored 29 points, and Boston used a big fourth quarter to
rally past the Indiana Pacers, 105-94, Tuesday night at Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Erick Strickland scored 22 points and Walter McCarty had 18 points
and 12 rebounds for Boston, which outscored the Pacers, 36-14, in the
fourth quarter.</LD>
<TE>   "My mind-set was that I never thought it was over," Pierce said.
"That's a tremendous strength of our ball club--always believing that
we will come back. When we can spread the court and get our
three-point shooters going, we never feel like we're out of it."</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics are third in the Eastern Conference, two games ahead
of Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Miller scored 26 points for Indiana, which is a game in
front of Toronto for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce, who scored just three points in the fourth quarter, shot
six of 11 from the field and 14 of 16 on free throws. Reserve forward
Rodney Rogers hit four three-pointers and scored 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana was in front almost the entire first three quarters, and
led 80-69 going into the final period.</TE>
<TE>   Boston, trailing by 10 midway through the fourth, held the Pacers
scoreless for more than five minutes. Rogers hit two three-pointers
and McCarty one as the Celtics scored 13 straight points for an 88-86
lead with 5:22 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 90, Miami 87--Ben Wallace grabbed 16 rebounds and blocked
six shots, including one by Alonzo Mourning with 15 seconds left to
preserve the lead for the Pistons at Miami. The Pistons, who have won
15 of their past 18 road games, trail the New Jersey Nets for the
Eastern Conference lead by two games with eight to go.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit led by one when Wallace blocked a hook shot by Mourning.
Jerry Stackhouse then made one of two free throws with 12 seconds
remaining to put the Pistons up by two, and Miami's LaPhonso Ellis
badly missed a three-point try with three seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Denver 98, Utah 90--Juwan Howard scored 20 points, and Calbert
Cheaney added 17 as the Nuggets won at Denver. Utah, which had won
five of six, is four games ahead of the Clippers for the final
playoff spot in the West. Utah plays the Clippers tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Malone sprained his right knee early in the first quarter after
Denver's Calbert Cheaney lost his balance and fell into him under the
basket.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 100, Seattle 98--Steve Francis scored 32 points and
Houston's reserves played a major role in a rally at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Payton finished with 25 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds
for the SuperSonics, who led by as many as 13 in the third quarter,
and were ahead, 84-74, with 9:51 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   But four points each from Moochie Norris and Terence Morris helped
fuel a 17-4 run for a 91-88 lead with four minutes to play. In all,
the Rockets' reserves contributed 15 of the team's last 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 107, Portland 91--Jason Richardson scored 26 points
as the Warriors won at Oakland to hand the Trail Blazers their fourth
loss in five games.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve guard Bob Sura scored 12 of his 23 points in the final
quarter, when the last-place Warriors outscored Portland, 30-13.
Gilbert Arenas had 22 points and Antawn Jamison 20 for the Warriors,
who broke a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Rasheed Wallace led Portland with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   New York 91, Charlotte 85--Mark Jackson had 13 points and nine
assists and Kurt Thomas had 11 points and 19 rebounds for the Knicks
at New York. Charlotte fell into a three-way tie with Philadelphia
and Milwaukee for fifth place in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson scored seven in a row for New York midway through the
fourth quarter to help keep the Knicks ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 100, Milwaukee 92--DerMarr Johnson scored a career-high 28
points and Jason Terry added 19 for the Hawks at Atlanta. It was the
seventh consecutive road loss for the Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   The game was delayed 28 minutes in the fourth quarter because of a
power failure. The Hawks were leading 82-78 with 7:28 remaining when
most of the overhead lights went out at Philips Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 101, Phoenix 96--Ricky Davis scored 28 points for the
Cavaliers at Cleveland as they broke a six-game losing streak. Shawn
Marion scored 28 points and hit a three-pointer with 14.9 seconds
left that brought the Suns to 98-96. Davis then made just one of two
free throws, giving Phoenix a chance to tie it.</TE>
<TE>   But Stephon Marbury was short with a 30-footer with seven seconds
remaining, and Tyrone Hill made two free throws to seal it for
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 107, Memphis 83--The Kings had six players in double
figures, led by Bobby Jackson's 19, to win easily at Memphis, Tenn.
The victory was the fifth consecutive for the Kings, who led, 59-37
at halftime. Sacramento forward Peja Stojakovic sat out his seventh
consecutive game with a strained right hamstring.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Does Nothing to Lower Great Expectations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In what was his spring mantra, his attempt to reduce expectations in
the aftermath of his season for the ages, Barry Bonds liked to say
that it went so far beyond anything he had done before that he didn't
want to think about it, that he simply wanted to let it go.</LD>
<LD>   "In some ways, I feel that last year was something I'm not," Bonds
said on a recent Arizona afternoon. "I hit more home runs than I ever
have, did some things I never have, and it would be nerve racking to
try to figure out how to do it again. It was the equivalent of two
seasons for me, and to think I can do it again is unrealistic."</LD>
<LD>   The 53,356 fans who were at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday might
disagree.</LD>
<TE>   All Bonds did in this first game of 2002 was pick up where he'd
left off in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   All he did was raise the expectations, bury the Dodgers and
provide evidence that even a pace suddenly projecting to 324 home
runs might not be unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   The four-time most valuable player created that interplanetary
projection by slugging two home runs--he also had a run-producing
single while driving in five runs--as the San Francisco Giants, with
their 9-2 victory, provided a pain of another kind for the still
rehabilitating Kevin Brown and sent the Dodgers back to the drawing
board.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the opener Dodger Manager Jim Tracy had envisioned, but
even he could only admire the performer and performance most
responsible for the defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "The man in left field did his fair share of damage," Tracy said
of Bonds. "The more you watch him, the more you reflect on what he's
done, he's beginning to make a case for himself that he's arguably
the best player ever to play the game. I was sitting there today,
trying to think of something he can't do, and there's really nothing
you can think of."</TE>
<TE>   In a resumption of his 2001 assault, Bonds left even teammates
feeling as if ... well, as first baseman J.T. Snow said, "It may be
unfair to keep expecting this, but we're at a point where we almost
do. He's in another league. In fact, he tends to make the rest of us
feel like we're in Little League with the shots he hits--the
regularity and distance. We barely get them over the fence in batting
practice, and he's hitting them 20 rows deep."</TE>
<TE>   Batting practice? Bonds was back doing it in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   He hit a three-run, opposite-field homer into the left-field
pavilion off Brown in the second inning, singled in a run off Brown
in the fourth--after narrowly missing a home run with a towering
drive to the foul side of the right-field pole--then recalculated on
an orbital shot off Omar Daal in the seventh, driving it on the fair
side of the same pole and into the loge seats.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds didn't leave the plate until the ball had landed, admiring
his work, and why not? He was only the 10th player to reach the loge
level as Dodger Stadium begins its 40th season. He is also only the
25th player to hit two home runs on opening day.</TE>
<TE>   The next 161?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't predict the future," Bonds said. "My only expectation is
to stay healthy."</TE>
<TE>   He said this while standing in the Giants' dugout, surrounded by
cameras and reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, hoping to reduce the individual requests for
interviews as they did during the second half of last season, will
hold a similar news conference for Bonds before tonight's game
against the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds is resigned to the inevitability of what awaits him this
year but wishes he could escape it.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when you hit two home runs on opening day and are
coming off a season in which you eclipsed Mark McGwire's single
season record with 73 home runs while also breaking Babe Ruth's
single season records for slugging percentage and walks, the demands
are only going to escalate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is crazy," Bonds said, fighting for breathing space in the
packed dugout. "I know it's part of it, but I really don't want to go
through it again. It was really hard to stay on that high for six
months, like I did last season. It takes a toll. I'm 37 going on 38
and trying to play like I'm 25. I mean, I'm proud to have done what I
did [last year] and happy to have done it in San Francisco, but if I
hit 30 or 40 home runs this year, I'll still feel that I've have had
a consistent year."</TE>
<TE>   As he embarks on a five-year, $90-million contract, Bonds seems
more in his prime than his twilight. He is probably bigger and
stronger than ever, having continued to follow a rigorous off-season
workout program that left training partner Gary Sheffield gasping.</TE>
<TE>   The distance of his loge-level shot Tuesday was one example of
Bonds' continuing quickness and strength, but the opposite-field
drive against a light wind on a 93-mph fastball by Brown might have
been even more impressive.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of his pitches sink," Bonds said. "This one stayed up. I
don't think he wanted it there."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker sat at his desk later, compared
Bonds to stars of the Henry Aaron, Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky
magnitude and said, "The man has 569 homers. We're past the point of
surprise. He's awesome. We have to feel blessed that we're here to
see it."</TE>
<TE>   Those 569 home runs leave Bonds only four behind Harmon Killebrew,
sixth on the all-time list. At his recent pace, Aaron and his 755
seem increasingly possible, but Bonds dismisses the prospect. On one
hand he hopes to keep the confidence and momentum of those 73 homers
in his "mental Rolodex" but, on the other, he would like to elude the
accompanying distractions.</TE>
<TE>   He continues to insist that he is more interested in the elusive
ring than Aaron's record.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not how you start but how you finish," he said, when asked
again about his impressive start Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate finish for me would be a World Series."</TE>

Nicklaus said Tuesday in a statement. "I really miss competitive

<HD>Cabrera Caps Off Montreal's Rally</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Montreal Expos made their fans forget about extinction and feel
some excitement.</LD>
<LD>   Down to their last out in what might have been their final season
opener, the Expos rallied for three runs in the bottom of the ninth
inning Tuesday and beat the Florida Marlins, 7-6, on Orlando
Cabrera's single.</LD>
<LD>   While Cabrera was mobbed by his teammates, Manager Frank Robinson
wildly waved his hat to the fans and gave them a big thumbs-up.</LD>
<TE>   "Who said there's not baseball fans in Montreal?" Robinson said.
"They were great out there tonight--very enthusiastic. They got us
going. They got us pumped up. They certainly got me pumped up and
they got the players pumped up--and this is what we need."</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 34,351 cheered loudly after Jose Vidro tied the score
with a two-out, two-run single and when Cabrera won it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always good when you have fans behind you," Vidro said.
"That gets your adrenaline going."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos survived baseball's plan to eliminate them during the
winter, but poor support is likely to doom them beyond this, their
34th season in Montreal. A crowd of only 3,500 to 6,000 is expected
for tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was especially satisfying for Montreal fans, seeing
who it came against.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Torborg, who managed Montreal for the final four months of
the 2001 season, moved from the Expos to Florida less than a week
before spring training. He changed jobs when Jeffrey Loria sold the
Expos to Major League Baseball and bought the Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   With Braden Looper (0-1) pitching, Brad Wilkerson drew a leadoff
walk in the Expos' ninth and Michael Barrett doubled.</TE>
<TE>   After pinch-hitter Henry Rodriguez and Peter Bergeron struck out,
Vidro singled and took second on the throw home, prompting the
Marlins to intentionally walk Vladimir Guerrero.</TE>
<TE>   That brought up Cabrera, who also had a run-scoring single that
capped a three-run eighth that made it 6-4. Matt Herges (1-0),
acquired from the Dodgers in spring training, got the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Preston Wilson hit a grand slam in the seventh, putting the
Marlins ahead, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 9, Houston 3--Ben Sheets struck out a career-high eight
batters, and Richie Sexson, Tyler Houston and Jose Hernandez each
drove in two runs at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Wade Miller, who won his final seven decisions last season and had
been 7-0 against Milwaukee, made his first opening-day start and left
in the fifth inning after consecutive homers by Sexson and Geoff
Jenkins.</TE>
<TE>   Sheets, a member of the gold medal-winning U.S. Olympic team two
years ago, gave up two runs and nine hits in six innings and walked
none.</TE>
<TE>   Miller gave up three or fewer earned runs in 23 of his 32 starts
last season but he equaled that in the first inning. He hit the first
two batters, threw a wild pitch, gave up a one-out run-scoring single
to Sexson and a two-run double to Houston.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Should Have Just Said No to Brown</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Opening day, Dodger Stadium's 40th birthday, what a party.</LD>
<LD>   The candles were in the San Francisco bats.</LD>
<LD>   The singing was in the San Francisco line drives.</LD>
<TE>   In the spirit of the affair--and because I could no longer bear to
watch--I closed my eyes and made a wish.</TE>
<TE>   I wished the Dodgers had not started Kevin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   I wished they had listened to their instincts instead of his
growl.</TE>
<TE>   I wished they had relied on statistics instead of symbolism.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers lost to the Giants, 9-2, not because Barry Bonds hit
two homers, or because Livan Hernandez allowed only four hits, or
because some of the 53,356 fans created bad karma when chanting,
"Giants ... " during a pregame speech by Peter O'Malley.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers lost because they started a guy only seven months
removed from major elbow surgery. A guy who had not lasted five full
innings in spring training. A guy who just turned 37.</TE>
<TE>   They lost because, around these parts, when Kevin Brown says he is
ready to pitch, he pitches.</TE>
<TE>   They lost because the Dodgers still haven't learned to tell him
no.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Giants did it for them.</TE>
<TE>   In the second inning, David Bell, Pedro Feliz and Hernandez
shouted it with consecutive singles on pitches that barely moved.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the inning, Rich Aurilia yelled it with a single on a
95-mph fastball that didn't budge.</TE>
<TE>   After which, Bonds screamed it with a home run off a 93-mph
fastball that refused to dance.</TE>
<TE>   The final rebuff was delivered in the third inning, when Bell
homered into the left-field box seats on a 90-mph fastball that was
flat as the faces in the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Brown left after four innings, his fastball was no
longer reaching 90, and overeager Giant batters were getting
themselves out.</TE>
<TE>   Four innings, seven earned runs.</TE>
<TE>   From a guy who started the game with a 1.86 earned-run average
against the Giants, and a 3.65 ERA on opening day.</TE>
<TE>   This simply doesn't happen to Kevin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Unless he's not yet Kevin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "To beat him on opening day was big for us," acknowledged Aurilia.</TE>
<TE>   And even larger for the Dodgers, their anticipated message of
strength turned on its head.</TE>
<TE>   Position players can struggle on opening day and nobody cares.</TE>
<TE>   A staff ace struggles and everybody wonders.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't believe it, check the pulse in Boston, where the Red
Sox Nation will be in limbo until Pedro Martinez pitches again.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown will be fine. By the end of this season, he could
easily be one of baseball's top pitchers again.</TE>
<TE>   But right now, he's not.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, he's not even one of the best pitchers in the Dodger
rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Given the mental hurdles of arm rehabilitation, the last thing
anyone in the organization needed was for Brown to step into the
middle of a crowded room and fall on his face.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers clearly understood this situation as recently as three
weeks ago, when Manager Jim Tracy and pitching coach Jim Colborn
raised the possibility that Brown might not be ready for opening day,
or even the opening week.</TE>
<TE>   Brown refused to talk to reporters for two weeks after the story
appeared.</TE>
<TE>   During this time, something happened to convince the Dodgers that
he was, in fact, ready.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers believe it was strictly pitching.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a side session the other day that was as good as anything
we had seen all spring," Tracy said. "That would indicate you are
going in the direction you need to be going ... and not in the
direction that would make you question whether he should pitch
opening day or not."</TE>
<TE>   But the gruff Brown rarely lets you question him anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Dodgers don't recognize it, the reasons for starting
him were probably part pitching, part persona.</TE>
<TE>   Brown wants the ball, no matter when, no matter what.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted the ball last year, even though his elbow was ripped.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted the ball Tuesday, even though another rehabilitation
start might have been helpful.</TE>
<TE>   Such a work ethic is admirable. But it can also be foolish.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers want so badly to believe in Brown as their
inspirational leader that this time they failed to realize the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   Said Colborn: "It was the right thing to start him today. He's our
horse. It's important for him. It's important for the team."</TE>
<TE>   Said Brown: "My arm is fine ... and if you feel like you can go,
what are you going to do, sit around? Thanks but no thanks?
Physically there is no reason I shouldn't be on the mound."</TE>
<TE>   Yet once there ...</TE>
<TE>   "I pretty much buried us," Brown admitted.</TE>
<TE>   He shoveled over a nice ride by the rebuilt top of the order--Dave
Roberts scored both runs and Cesar Izturis laid down two great bunts.</TE>
<TE>   He shoveled over the first relief appearance by Eric Gagne, who
stranded two Giant runners in the seventh inning with two quick outs.</TE>
<TE>   And talk about shrouding a perfectly good birthday party.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever song was being sung out there Tuesday, it certainly did
not end with, " ... and many more."</TE>

<LD>A bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the seventh inning enabled
Westminster La Quinta High to pull out an 8-7 victory over Lakewood
on Tuesday night at Cal State Fullerton and give Coach Dave Demarest
his 600th career victory in a quarterfinal baseball game of the Toyo
Tires National Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Lakewood (13-3) had taken a 7-6 lead in the top of the seventh on
a two-out, two-strike, two-run home run by David Balandran.</LD>
<LD>   La Quinta (14-1) tied the score on a run-scoring single by Charlie
Cortez. Zack Blanchard's bunt single loaded the bases with one out.
Andrew Hill then drew the game-winning walk from reliever Jamie
Hillis. Ian Stewart hit his ninth home run for La Quinta and fourth
in four games. The Aztecs advanced to today's 5 p.m. semifinal at
Fullerton. Shortstop Blake Crosby, who had to leave the game in the
first inning with a bruised right wrist after being struck by a
pitch, is not expected to play.</LD>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>

<TE>   In other National Classic quarterfinal games:</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Esperanza 3, West Hills Chaminade 2--Matt Lawson had a
two-run double in the fifth inning to break a 1-1 tie and lift
Esperanza (9-5).</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Paschal struck out nine for Chaminade (9-3).</TE>
<TE>   La Puente Bishop Amat 8, San Diego El Capitan 7--Adam Simon hit a
two-run double in the bottom of the sixth inning to cap a three-run
rally for No. 2 Bishop Amat, which trailed 6-4 entering the inning.
Anthony Hidalgo doubled in a run for Bishop Amat to trim the lead to
7-6 before Simon's double.</TE>
<TE>   Placentia El Dorado 14, Foothill (Palo Centro) 4--Chris Wilson had
three hits, including a three-run home run, and four runs batted in
for No. 14 El Dorado (11-3). Sophomore Kyle Rucker (1-0) pitched four
innings in his first varsity start. The Golden Hawks play Bishop Amat
tonight at 7 at Cal State Fullerton in a semifinal game.</TE>
<TE>   In boys' golf:</TE>
<TE>   Atascadero 218, Santa Barbara San Marcos 220, Westlake 221--Cory
Powell and Mike Paglialonga each shot even-par 72 and Jeremy Gearhart
shot 74 for No. 6 Atascadero in its own tournament at Chalk Mountain
Golf Course and the Greyhounds won their second tournament in as many

<LD>Dodger Dogs cost a quarter more, beer's up 50 cents and parking has
been boosted a dollar, but the team on the field doesn't appear to be
worth a plug nickel.</LD>
<LD>   On the bright side, Major League Baseball is trying to cut four
minutes off every contest, and could go a long way to really
shortening the misery here if it allows the Dodger Mercy Rule:
Calling it a day after the other team has posted its third run.</LD>
<LD>   I can't imagine the Dodgers scoring three runs in a game this
season. If they do, I'd bring back the opening-day bunting and
celebrate as if it's a postseason victory so everyone around here can
remember what that feels like.</LD>
<TE>   I'm telling you, it's bad enough the Dodgers were pummeled, 9-2,
and were out of it in the second inning after the Giants took a 5-1
lead, but now here's the bad news: "We have 161 more games left,"
catcher Paul Lo Duca said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I chastised Lo Duca for going early to the cliches, he said,
"You didn't know I was a good mathematician--did you?" and while I
appreciate his sense of humor, he was hitting a little close to home
because the Dodgers played baseball Tuesday like a bunch of
accountants on their lunch break.</TE>
<TE>   I thought about chastising Kevin Brown too, but I figured Barry
Bonds already had spanked him hard enough.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DAY had started with such promise too. I arrived at Dodger
Stadium and the first face I saw was the friendliest face in the
place--that of Luis Arevalo, beginning his 25th year as elevator
operator. It's easy to understand, of course, why he's never
depressed--he's never seen a Dodger game in all that time, and
refuses to watch it on the TV in his elevator, "because I'd hurt my
neck turning to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Down on the field the first thing I noticed were new faces on the
outfield wall, and these weren't friendly faces. Obviously we all
know why the Dodgers have Eric Karros pictured on the right-field
wall catching the ball instead of trying to hit it, but I struggled a
little bit with the picture of Mr. Grumpy, which had to be
computer-enhanced, because it had him smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Brown is smiling every time he gets on that private plane
the Dodgers have to let him use, but it's not as if I'm going to get
an invite to see it, and if I do, I'm not going anywhere without a
parachute.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be pretty darn distracting this year to sit in the
press box and see that toothy smiling mug looking back at me knowing
the guy probably needs pliers to pry apart his lips every morning
just to brush his teeth.</TE>
<TE>   I thought about chastising Brown for being a party to deception,
but instead I figured I'd just print his earned-run average in
bold--15.75, and smile myself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN IT came time to address the media after the game, Brown not
only was civil, but a stand-up guy taking every question without
unleashing a single snarl, which tells me he really wasn't on his
game Tuesday. "No excuses," Brown said. "It was a bad day."</TE>
<TE>   You have to give a guy credit for being accountable, and I'd also
like to give credit to my computer, because I didn't think it'd allow
me to type in anything even remotely positive about Brown. But I
applaud Brown for being a real good loser.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE'S NOTHING like opening day, of course. Last year the Dodgers
set free hundreds of white doves and then shot off fireworks, the
birds probably still seeing therapists to get over the scare, and
they were set free again Tuesday only to take to the skies and find
five jets heading straight for them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS PART of the ceremonies former Dodger owner Peter O'Malley threw
out the first pitch, which was caught by Chad Kreuter. I wasn't sure
he'd catch it either.</TE>
<TE>   Like everyone else, I was worried Kreuter might never catch again
after playing caddie to Chan Ho Park, who left for Texas. But I've
been assured that every time O'Malley takes the mound, Kreuter will
be his catcher.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BEFORE THE game Lo Duca walked past me without saying a word or
even looking my way, but he nearly trampled a pair of slow-moving
radio guys who got in his way as he tried to say hello to Fox Sports
Net's Lisa Guerrero. I guess I'll have to start carrying a microphone
around with me to get noticed.</TE>
<TE>   I was telling this to Steve Brener, L.A.'s top sports publicist,
who had brought his 15-year-old son, Danny, to the game, when Danny
just blurts out: "Lisa Guerrero is hot."</TE>
<TE>   The look on his dad's face told me he didn't disagree, but he
said, "All this time he's been telling me he's doing his homework
while he's on the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   I believe he has.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KARROS AUTOGRAPHED baseballs are selling for $99 at Art of the
Game down the left-field line. Obviously they've never been hit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS trailed the Giants, 5-1, in the second with Adrian
Beltre on first and the Double-Play Machine at the plate. No one
expected Beltre to run, but he did, and he was thrown out. Then
Karros walked.</TE>
<TE>   You'd have to be a knucklehead to run Beltre, which reminds me, I
forgot to ask Manager Jim Tracy if he had given the sign for Beltre
to run. For the record, I didn't refer to Tracy as a knucklehead
until the second game last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I BUMPED into Alan Stanhope, a fan from Simi Valley, and he was
wearing a Dodger jersey, so I asked who his favorite Dodger is. "Mike
Scioscia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I ALSO ran into another fan, who refused to give me his name
because he had called in sick. He told me he was an attorney, and I
had already guessed that when he told me he was pulling a fast one on
his bosses. He told me his initials were S.A.H. Let the guessing in
law firms in the L.A. area begin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PATTI LABELLE delivered the worst rendition of the national anthem
I've heard at a sporting event--too bad the jets were too late to
drown her out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in the form of a plea to Dodger Stadium
public address announcer Mike Carlucci, who persists in saying:
"Ladies and Gentlemen, your Los Angeles Dodgers."</TE>
<TE>   Do you have to remind us?</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Trying Mexico for Size</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Americans won't be able to claim physical
inferiority tonight, like they did after loss to Germany.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter what happens against Mexico at Invesco Field in Denver
tonight, the coaches and players of the United States national soccer
team won't be able to reprise the excuse they used last Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Then, after a 4-2 loss to Germany in Rostock, Germany, in a game
in which the score could have been even more lopsided, the Germans'
size and power were said to have caused the Americans' downfall.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought the key to the game was their physical strength," Coach
Bruce Arena said.</LD>
<TE>   Arena's view was echoed by two of his most experienced players,
goalkeeper Kasey Keller and midfielder Earnie Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously they are a very big and strong team," Keller said. "And
when you are a little bit smaller, you have to want it that much
more, and we got pushed around a bit today."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly, said Stewart:</TE>
<TE>   "They have so many big boys in there that sometimes, especially
with corner kicks, they start to push and shove, and they get that
physical advantage."</TE>
<TE>   That will not be the case tonight. Mexico is nowhere near as
physically imposing as Germany, but it is just as dangerous. And
there will be more than simply pride at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's Coach Javier Aguirre said this week that on April 15 he
will name the 23-man roster he will take to the World Cup in Japan
and South Korea in May. Mexico plays Croatia, Ecuador and Italy in
the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre will be without the Spanish-based trio of midfielder
Gerardo Torrado and forwards Cuauhtemoc Blanco and Juan Francisco
Palencia, as well as French-based defender Rafael Marquez.</TE>
<TE>   Braulio Luna, who has scored three goals in his last two games for
Necaxa, was called in Monday by Aguirre, who also has recalled
goalkeeper Jorge Campos and midfielder German Villa for the match.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to take advantage of the opportunity I have been given,"
Luna said, a feeling shared by players from both teams.</TE>
<TE>   One of Aguirre's more interesting inclusions is Pachuca midfielder
Gabriel Caballero. He was born in Argentina but has played in Mexico
for seven years and in December became a Mexican citizen in the hope
of making Mexico's World Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   For the U.S., this will be the last home game before Arena selects
his own World Cup roster after a game April 17 against Ireland in
Dublin.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen of the 18 players Arena has available tonight are from
Major League Soccer, and for some it will be the last chance to make
the U.S. team, which plays Portugal, South Korea and Poland in the
World Cup's first round.</TE>
<TE>   Considering how easily Germany was able to brush aside the U.S.
defense last week, tonight's game would seem to be especially
important for defenders Frankie Hejduk of Bayer Leverkusen, Greg
Vanney of Bastia and Pablo Mastroeni of the Colorado Rapids. None of
the three played against Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did goalkeeper Tony Meola, a veteran of 1990 and 1994
tournaments who is trying to reach his third World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "To be part of another World Cup would be a great honor," Meola
said Tuesday. "I know that Bruce [Arena] has his mind set on Brad
[Friedel] and Kasey [Keller], but I know that he is also looking for
someone who is ready to play if anything happens. That part of it I
accept.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, being part of the [World Cup] team is something
special.... To make this team after skipping one [1998] with the
injury and people writing me off would be a great accomplishment."</TE>

<HD>Paus: A Year Older, Wiser</HD>
<DH>College football: Bruin quarterback says he has turned his
life around and wants to win back the starting job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Things UCLA quarterback Cory Paus will not be doing for his 22nd
birthday Thursday:</LD>
<LD>   * Going for a drive. He mostly gets around by bicycle, bus or
bumming rides from friends after having his driving privilege revoked
for his second alcohol-related conviction.</LD>
<LD>   * Having a beer with his buddies. The senior, required to take
part in an alcohol-diversion program, says he hasn't had a drink in
nearly two months and has no desire to start again.</LD>
<TE>   * Feeling sorry for himself. If Paus needs someone to blame for
his problems, he knows where to look--the mirror. Spending a few days
in jail taught him that.</TE>
<TE>   A contrite Paus, addressing the media before UCLA opened spring
practice Tuesday, took responsibility for his off-the-field foibles
and expressed a desire to win back the respect of teammates, coaches
and fans through his rededication to football and learning from his
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   He also made it clear that the starting quarterback job is his,
despite Coach Bob Toledo's plans to put off naming a starter until he
has time to assess incoming freshmen Matt Moore and Drew Olson in the
fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident in my ability and confident where I stand in this
program," said Paus, the only Bruin quarterback who has taken a snap
in a college game.</TE>
<TE>   "But I also realize how important it is for [the freshmen] to be
ready to play, and I know that I can help them learn this offense
faster. And I'm going to [do that] because Cade [McNown] did it for
me when I obviously wasn't coming in with any chance of playing over
him.</TE>
<TE>   "No disrespect to any of those kids, but I plan on being the
starting quarterback. At the same time, [the freshmen] need to be
ready to play. I'm still going to take them under my wing, I'm still
going to treat them like that."</TE>
<TE>   Paus plans to start being a mentor this week to Moore and Olson,
who are expected to observe spring drills. Redshirt freshman John
Sciarra is the only other scholarship quarterback aside from Paus
participating in spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly, though, Paus plans to work on his game, which has suffered
in the past from inconsistency. He says an injury to his right thumb
that contributed to some poor passing performances last season is
nearly healed, and he is eager to begin playing and rebuilding his
personal reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Paus hid his drunk-driving convictions from Toledo until they came
to light two days before the USC game Nov. 17. Toledo allowed him to
play, the Bruins lost, 27-0, and Paus was demoted to third string for
the season finale against Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy that I still have the opportunity to play because of
the circumstances," he said. "I made a huge mistake twice, and
obviously people are not happy about it, which I couldn't blame
anybody because it was a big blemish on this university and the
football program."</TE>
<TE>   Paus said he has no problem with Toledo making him compete for a
starting job that would normally be handed to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely deserve anything that he decides to give me, or how
ever he decides to punish me," Paus said. Paus, who needs 134 yards
to move into second place behind McNown on UCLA's career passing
list, said being jailed in the Twin Towers facility was an
"eye-opening experience." He was sentenced to 96 hours but says he
was released after being incarcerated for about "55 or 60" hours in
January.</TE>
<TE>   "It was definitely somewhere that I'd never been and somewhere
where I'd really not care to go back to," he said. "I never felt like
I was in danger by any means, but it was probably the biggest
learning experience through all this.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a lot of support, believe it or not, from a lot of the
guards. I got a lot of encouragement, but at the same time almost a
slap too. Like, 'Do you realize what you could lose? You shouldn't be
in here.' It was good to hear."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to serving jail time, Paus was required to pay a
$1,300 fine, enroll in an 18-month alcohol-diversion program and
serve five years' probation. He said he hasn't had a drink since
starting the diversion program, which requires him to meet with a
counselor a set number of times a month and attend a three-hour
alcohol awareness class once a week.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel any need to drink," he said. "It's caused me enough
of a headache to the point where it's not worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Paus denied he has a drinking problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I definitely made some poor judgments," he said. "I don't
think I have a drinking problem. But I can understand where anybody
would say, 'Well, how do you explain two arrests for alcohol-related
incidents?'"</TE>
<TE>   UCLA will hold 14 more spring practices through April 27.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Salsbury, a former All-American lineman from UCLA, died Friday
after battling a serious blood infection. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Salsbury, born in Culver City, helped the Bruin offense average 40
points a game in 1954, when UCLA won the national championship. A
four-year letterman, he was selected as an All-American in 1954. He
also played in the NFL with the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers
from 1955-58.</LD>
<LD>   In lieu of flowers, the family asked that donations be made to
Grace Walk Ministries in Paradise Valley, Ariz. A memorial service
will be held April 14 at Scottsdale Bible Church Chapel in
Scottsdale, Ariz.</LD>

<HD>USC Arena Plans Take Baby Steps</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Although fund-raising continues,
administrators express interest in project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last few months, USC administrators have quietly talked to
architects about resuming work on a long-awaited arena at the edge of
campus.</LD>
<LD>   The discussions with HNTB, a Kansas City firm, have hardly been
urgent but represent the first outward sign of progress in more than
a year. Joe Diesko, an HNTB vice president, said, "I get the sense
they are getting closer."</LD>
<LD>   The question is, with yet another college basketball season having
come and gone, how much closer?</LD>
<TE>   On one hand, cautious administrators say they are "doing very
well" with fund-raising and hope to make an announcement "before
long."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the proposed 12,000-seat venue still lacks a
naming-rights sponsor, a private or corporate donor to pay much of
the $70 million in construction costs. Worse, the university had to
turn away at least one corporation willing to fill that void.</TE>
<TE>   The dollars were right but the terms were wrong. And therein lies
the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators have often said construction cannot begin until all
the money is in hand. That is not entirely accurate but it's close.</TE>
<TE>   In accordance with a campuswide dictum, the athletic department
must settle its bills within 11 quarters of receiving final approval
from the board of trustees.</TE>
<TE>   That time frame--roughly the span from design to
occupancy--represents a tough fit in a marketplace where many naming
deals are spread over 15 years or longer. According to sources, the
athletic department had to reject a sizable offer from a corporation
that wanted to pay over 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Associate athletic director Carol Dougherty, while declining to
talk specifics, explained: "We need to have our agreement
front-loaded."</TE>
<TE>   USC President Steven Sample, who did not comment for this story,
has reportedly been adamant about the pay-off period because the
university is undertaking other costly projects and because the
arena--unlike a new academic building--cannot generate revenue from
tuition or research.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what the athletic department and the president agreed on,"
said Dennis Dougherty, senior vice president for administration and
Carol's husband. "The athletic department budget can't handle debt
service."</TE>
<TE>   The project has a history of fits and starts dating 30 years. USC
coaches are known to crack jokes about it and former Trojan player
Paul Westphal, now the coach at Pepperdine, recalled being shown
architectural plans when he was a high school recruit in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   So there was understandable skepticism in 1999 when Sample and
Athletic Director Mike Garrett announced plans to renew the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this a great day for USC or what?" Sample said.</TE>
<TE>   Fans could only hope it was a watershed moment.</TE>
<TE>   Sketches provided by HNTB depicted a domed arena beside the Harbor
Freeway, built in the red-brick and stone motif of the adjacent
campus.</TE>
<TE>   It was going to be large enough to accommodate a regional round of
the NCAA men's basketball tournament. It would be a place for the
arts and community events as well as sports.</TE>
<TE>   The athletic department, which agreed to raise all the money,
would control the facility. Administrators rejected financial help
from an outside group that wanted to act as partner and manager.</TE>
<TE>   But raising the money proved difficult and, as time passed, the
estimated cost rose from $50 million to $100 million. With Sample
setting a $70-million limit, the athletic department made
cost-cutting changes to the initial design and decided to leave
several features for addition later.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the money has now been raised--administrators will not
confirm how much--but the site at Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa
Street remains untouched. Not so much as a sign will be placed there
until all the money is available.</TE>
<TE>   According to a prominent executive in the naming-rights business,
the university faces an uphill battle.</TE>
<TE>   "Most corporate partners don't want to see themselves as the
source of funding ... they want to know you're going to build
regardless," said Jeff Knapple, president of Envision, a Los Angeles
marketing firm that negotiated the deals for Staples Center and
Philips Arena in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to say it can't work other ways," he said. "The task is more
challenging the way they are doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Knapple is familiar with the USC project because he made a bid to
represent it four years ago. The university chose sports-marketing
giant IMG, then returned to Knapple last year, only to find he was
occupied with other clients in Southern California. After contracting
with a third firm for nine months, administrators have decided to
handle negotiations themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Dougherty said the athletic department has been in contact
with several interested corporations and private donors. There has
also been preliminary talk of seeking a donor to put his or her name
on Heritage Hall, the university's athletic headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the university has been working with the
Community Redevelopment Agency in preparation for acquiring permits
and recently showed site plans to City Councilwoman Jane Perry, who
considers the project a potentially attractive addition to the
Figueroa Corridor. Thus the recent talks with HNTB, which had been
awaiting word since preparing rough architectural diagrams more than
a year ago. The parties are working on contract details, seen as a
minor step but a step forward nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   "They called and said they wanted to start doing this," Diesko
said. "We're very excited."</TE>

<HD>Capistrano to Pursue a Home Depot Deal</HD>
<DH>Land use: Despite concern over changing city's character,
council votes 4 to 1 to negotiate sale of 13 acres for store.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home Depot hopes to build a store in San Juan Capistrano, and to some
officials that looks like a windfall: $9 million for the city-owned
land the company wants, a sales-tax bonanza in the future. But
hundreds of residents say it would be a disaster.</LD>
<LD>   About 1,800 people signed a petition against the sale, saying it
would destroy the character of the town, with its 150-year-old adobes
and famous mission. What's more, they say, such a "big box" store
would bring traffic that would clog roads, pollute the air and even
block ocean breezes from a mobile-home park for senior citizens.</LD>
<LD>   "If they build this, it will no longer be the same small town,"
said Trish Hodges, a resident of Capistrano Valley Mobile Estates,
which borders the 13 acres Home Depot wants. "Businesses will move
out."</LD>
<TE>   More than 100 residents argued with officials into the night
Tuesday over the plan to put the 131,000-square-foot store two miles
from the historic downtown, with its one-of-a-kind shops, restaurants
and taverns. After two hours of public comment, the City Council
voted 4 to 1 to proceed with negotiations to sell the property.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposition before you tonight is like a big bowl of spinach.
You may not like the taste of it, you may not like the smell of it,
but it's good for you," said Douglas Dumhart, an analyst for the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the ferocity of the debate, the city hired a retail
analyst to project the economic effect of what would be the city's
second large retailer. The first, Costco, opened in 1988 on Doheny
Park Road despite heavy opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Alfred Gobar &amp; Associates' report to the city economic development
department last summer concluded that a Home Depot would take as much
as $9.1 million in annual sales away from 27 small businesses, some
of which would go broke.</TE>
<TE>   The study also said the giant home-improvement company is
determined to open a store in the area and will do so regardless of
whether San Juan Capistrano agrees to sell it the 13 acres on
Stonehill Drive near Interstate 5. That prompted some city officials
to support the store, if for no other reason than to capture its
sales-tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "If it doesn't go here, it will likely go someplace very near
here," said Councilman David M. Swerdlin. "We are already losing a
great deal of our sales-tax base to these big boxes outside of our
border."</TE>
<TE>   Swerdlin said Home Depot is eyeing parcels just outside the city
limits. If the company builds on one of those, he said, "it would
have the same impact on our local businesses, with one additional
impact: We wouldn't get the sales-tax revenue."</TE>
<TE>   Economists call that "leakage," meaning tax dollars seep away to
nearby cities. Gobar reported that San Juan Capistrano leaked about
$14 million worth of taxable sales on home-improvement products in
2000. Among the beneficiaries were the Home Depot in Mission Viejo
and the Lowe's in San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   "The citizens of San Juan Capistrano either cannot find all of the
products and goods they need from local merchants, or perhaps they
are finding better price points outside of the city's boundary," the
report says. "Having a Home Depot in San Juan Capistrano would
reverse that trend."</TE>
<TE>   But opponents of the store say the report states that as many as
55 workers would be displaced by a local Home Depot, though they
might apply for jobs at the store.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people who have had businesses in town for a long
time," said Councilman John Gelff, who cast the lone vote against the
plan. "Their revenues may not be as big, but they have been here for
the long haul, putting money into the community, and they are saying
this will put them out. We have to draw the line in the sand here."</TE>
<TE>   Gelff also questioned Home Depot's commitment to San Juan
Capistrano, considering that it has a profitable store nearby. Other
retail giants, among them Wal-Mart and Kmart, have closed stores
across the nation as they refocused their business strategies. If
that happened in San Juan Capistrano, Gelff said, "we could end up
with a large boxy building that is empty and can't be used for
anything else."</TE>
<TE>   The Gobar report says a new Home Depot would be competing against
the Mission Viejo store, so sales probably would be 25% lower than at
the chain's typical location. That most likely reflects "a defensive
strategy intended to preserve market share," Gobar wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Those projections alarm Gelff and others, who fear the store would
lead the list of locations to close if the company should have to
scale back.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot officials called Gobar's projections low and said they
expect tremendous sales growth at a San Juan Capistrano store.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't going to be a profitable area, we wouldn't build a
store there," said Kathryn Gallagher, a spokeswoman for the company.</TE>
<TE>   She also challenged the premise that small businesses would
suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "We find when we come into town, a lot of times it raises the
general awareness of do-it-yourself culture, and local businesses
benefit," she said. For example, she said, if the store offers
classes on how to lay tile, customers might take the class there but
buy their tile at a locally owned custom shop.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to live in harmony," Gallagher said.</TE>
<TE>   Some local merchants scoffed at that suggestion and said they are
girded for battle and will survive.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been there since 1972," said Ruth DeNault, an owner of
DeNault's True Value Hardware near the historic mission.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to be there, whether they come or not."</TE>

<HD>Historic O.C. City's Choice: Small Town vs. Home Depot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home Depot hopes to build a store in San Juan Capistrano, and to some
officials that looks like a windfall: $9 million for the city-owned
land the company wants, a sales-tax bonanza in the future. But
hundreds of residents say it would be a disaster.</LD>
<LD>   About 1,800 people signed a petition against the sale, saying it
would destroy the character of the town, with its 150-year-old adobes
and famous mission.</LD>
<LD>   "If they build this, it will no longer be the same small town,"
said Trish Hodges, a resident of Capistrano Valley Mobile Estates,
which borders the 13 acres Home Depot wants. "Businesses will move
out."</LD>
<TE>   More than 100 residents argued with officials into the night
Tuesday over the plan to put the 131,000-square-foot store two miles
from the historic downtown, with its one-of-a-kind shops, restaurants
and taverns.</TE>
<TE>   After two hours of public comment, the City Council voted 4 to 1
to proceed with negotiations to sell the property.</TE>
<TE>   In a report commissioned by the city, analysts Alfred Gobar &amp;
Associates said the Home Depot would take as much as $9.1 million of
annual sales away from 27 small businesses, some of which would go
broke.</TE>
<TE>   The study also said the giant home-improvement company is
determined to open another store in the area and will do so
regardless of whether San Juan Capistrano agrees to sell it the 13
acres on Stonehill Drive near the San Diego Freeway.</TE>

<HD>Suit Alleging Abuse by Priest Prompts Criminal
Investigation</HD>
<DH>Santa Clara County: The D.A. may file charges in sex case
involving a mentally disabled man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOS GATOS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Law enforcement authorities are investigating allegations that a
priest molested a mentally disabled man at the Sacred Heart Jesuit
Center here between 1996 and 2000.</LD>
<LD>   A detective for the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department on
Tuesday spent 2 1/2 hours interviewing a 50-year-old former kitchen
worker at Sacred Heart who previously claimed he had been abused by
Father Edward Thomas Burke, 80.</LD>
<LD>   "The investigation is progressing," said Sgt. Dianne L. Camarda,
who scheduled a follow-up interview with the victim. "I want to make
sure things are set in stone."</LD>
<TE>   The Times reported last month that Burke admitted in April 2000
that he had engaged in sexual misconduct with the victim. Jesuit
superiors at Sacred Heart immediately relocated Burke to a residence
at Santa Clara University, but neglected to notify authorities of his
sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Burke is one of four Jesuits named as defendants in a lawsuit
alleging that two mentally retarded men were subjected to repeated
acts of sodomy, molestation and false imprisonment at Sacred Heart, a
retreat in the foothills overlooking the Santa Clara Valley.
Attorneys representing the California Province of the Society of
Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits, are continuing to negotiate a
financial settlement with lawyers for the two victims. The plaintiffs
are seeking more than $10 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   Burke, a former librarian, was reassigned last week from the
residence on the Santa Clara University campus to another Jesuit
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Brown, supervising deputy district attorney of Santa
Clara County's sexual assault unit, confirmed the Burke investigation
and said prosecutors are awaiting Camarda's report. "We need the
investigation to be completed" before considering whether to file
charges, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the Jesuits and Burke declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The claims involving Burke came to the attention of authorities on
March 24, when a Times story disclosed the allegations against the
four Jesuits in the civil suit. "I had never heard anything about
sodomy until I saw the article," Camarda said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Camarda investigated allegations made by the two
victims, identified in court papers as "John Doe" and "James Doe,"
that they had been subjected to repeated sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Father Thomas H. Smolich, head of the California Province, has
acknowledged that Burke and Brother Charles Leonard Connor took
advantage of the mentally disabled men.</TE>
<TE>   According to a three-page memo by a former superior at Sacred
Heart, Burke admitted in 2000 that he had engaged in sexual
misconduct with James. The superior, Father Richard Cobb, wrote that
Burke told him: "How long has this happened? About four years--in his
room.... Yes, there has been some sexual contact in my room. Last
sexual contact, three weeks ago, in [James'] room."</TE>
<TE>   Connor, 80, also named in the suit, was convicted last year of
committing a felony lewd act on a dependent adult. He served six
months of home detention and now lives in a Jesuit residence in the
San Francisco Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Connor's conviction was based on statements to authorities by John
Doe, 56. In the Burke case, James Doe was unwilling two years ago to
discuss sexual abuses, Camarda said.</TE>
<TE>   "[James] didn't want to talk about that," Camarda said. "I can't
make him. You can't have a crime without a victim."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, James Doe's sister, Debra Sullivan, testified in a
deposition taken as part of the lawsuit that James told her Burke had
committed sodomy against him.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said she wants Burke sent to jail for abusing
her brother. She had declined to file a criminal complaint against
Burke on the advice of her lawyer, Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   Burke could face up to three years in state prison if convicted of
engaging in a lewd act with a dependent adult.</TE>

<HD>It's Right on the Tip of Their Tongues</HD>
<DH>Secession: Residents of Valley and harbor area narrow list
of possible names.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Camelot made the cut. So did San Fernando Valley, Mission Valley,
Rancho San Fernando and Valley City.</LD>
<LD>   Those are the names chosen Tuesday night by popular demand, as
Valley secessionists huddled inside a North Hills car dealership to
decide the big question: what to name the proposed Valley city.</LD>
<LD>   It was grass-roots democracy at its finest, according to the
secession group Valley VOTE. More than 100 Valley residents voted for
their favorite names by slapping navy-blue stickers on posters
listing the 25 choices.</LD>
<TE>   Then, in the Valley's own version of the electoral college, the
executive board members of Valley VOTE cast their votes with hot-pink
stickers.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety minutes later, the vote was in. The five winners now go to
the state agency studying whether to put secession to a citywide vote
in November. If that happens, those names will appear on the ballot
so that Valley voters can pick their favorite.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rollicking night of impassioned speeches in a stuffy
conference room at Galpin Ford. Old women in orthopedic shoes and
young men in baseball caps took the podium to pitch their favorites
to the overflow crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a late nominee," shouted David Morris, a Malibu resident
who showed up to make sure the Vals didn't choose an "ugly" name.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got valid pronunciations for both Anglos and Latinos,"
Morris said. "The name I'm thinking of is Valparaiso."</TE>
<TE>   "Huh?" said an elderly man in the back of the room.</TE>
<TE>   "It means Valley of Paradise," yelled a woman wearing a denim
jacket. "Do I get a prize?"</TE>
<TE>   Valparaiso, as it happens, didn't even make the top 10. The way
the contest was structured left it to Valley VOTE board members to
choose the final five names after the public picked its 10 favorites.
In the end, the board's pink stickers overrode Valley View in favor
of Camelot.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time Tuesday, residents in the harbor area, which is
also seeking secession, pared down the list of names for their
proposed city to five. Cabrillo Beach was the top choice, followed by
Pacific Harbor, Pelican Shores, Port Cabrillo and Angel's Gate.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor secessionists also took a decidedly grass-roots approach,
mirroring the personality of the community.</TE>
<TE>   "We're an earthy bunch of people down here," said group leader
Andrew Mardesich. "We're blue collar, middle class.</TE>
<TE>   We don't have a bunch of wealthy, sophisticated types. Most of us
have lived here all our lives, so this was a true grass-roots
campaign."</TE>
<TE>   From the start, Valley VOTE's process of naming its new metropolis
was decidedly public, reflecting the secessionist yen for local
control.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than hiring a consultant to devise marketable names, Valley
VOTE took the question straight to the people, collecting almost 400
suggestions via mail, fax and telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the people's thing," Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain
said. "It's their choice. It's their city."</TE>
<TE>   But the notion of naming by popular vote chilled seasoned branding
experts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the best way to do it," said Michael Fanuele, director
of brand strategy for New York-based J. Walter Thompson, the nation's
oldest advertising agency. Instead, he said the decision should be
left to a small group of people who have considered well what the new
city is supposed to represent.</TE>
<TE>   "Naming seems to be one of those areas in which, if you ask lots
of people to really think about it, you come up with more problems
than solutions," Fanuele said.</TE>
<TE>   "Take the Ford Thunderbird, an amazing, sexy, fast car. You ask a
man on the street and he might say, 'Thunder is noisy. As a matter of
fact, thunder is bad. Thunder happens when there are storms. I don't
like the name.' As soon as you throw out a name, it becomes
emotional. That's a dangerous thing when you're trying to have a
rational civic debate."</TE>
<TE>   Branding gurus say that the best product names describe essential
attributes, appeal to consumers and distinguish themselves from
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley's case, Valley VOTE simply whittled its list down to
the most popular 25 submissions. They included dreamy titles like
Hope City, historic names along the lines of Lankershim and
Mulholland City, and plainer labels like New Valley or El Valle.</TE>

<DH>LAPD: The Police Commission defers a decision on the
chief's future after a nine-hour interview. Both sides express
satisfaction with the meeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission completed a nearly nine-hour job
interview with Police Chief Bernard C. Parks Tuesday, but made no
immediate decision on whether he should be reappointed to a second
five-year term.</LD>
<LD>   The make-or-break sessions for the 37-year LAPD veteran, which
stretched over two days, left commission members with so much
information to digest that they said they will defer their decision
until at least next week.</LD>
<LD>   Parks appeared subdued in brief appearances Monday and early
Tuesday. But when he emerged from the final portion of the interview
about 2 p.m. Tuesday, he was walking jauntily and smiling broadly. He
called the session "a great exercise."</LD>
<TE>   Commissioners, who lingered two hours after he left, ended their
meeting in what appeared to be a jovial mood. The session was "very
informative, very informative, really," said Commissioner David S.
Cunningham III.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' request for a second term was thrown into question when
Mayor James K. Hahn announced earlier this year that he opposed the
chief's reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   The City Charter calls for the commission, whose members are
appointed by the mayor, to make the decision. The commission's vote
is subject to a City Council override.</TE>
<TE>   A closed session to consider the chief's reappointment scheduled
for today was postponed until Monday, and is scheduled to continue
through Tuesday and next Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's much-anticipated interview with Parks was held in
closed session, despite Parks' request to open it to the public and
the protests of activists who demanded that they be able to hear what
he had to say.</TE>
<TE>   It started Monday afternoon with a brief hitch, after Parks
surprised commissioners by bringing his lawyer to the session and was
told that would not fly. The session went more smoothly,
commissioners said, as a presentation Parks had prepared evolved into
what they described as a lengthy, free-flowing question-and-answer
session that lasted well into the night and resumed Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   After a month of ferocious machinations and controversy over the
chief's reappointment, Tuesday's session unfolded in a relatively
quiet atmosphere. The commission's regularly scheduled meeting was
sparsely attended, with only about a dozen activists on either side
of the battle on hand. Opponents wore T-shirts bearing the chief's
name with a line through it.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners also seemed at pains to downplay the drama.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Parks' most vocal advocates said Tuesday that the
commission's constantly repeated assertions that it was proceeding
independently of the mayor's view had left them less certain than
before it started that the outcome was foretold.</TE>
<TE>   The impression seemed to defuse some of the political furor that
at times had risen to insults and implicit threats as the commission
has set about evaluating the chief. Some Parks supporters Tuesday
said they were resigned to simply waiting. "Strategically, we need to
take time out," said John Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban
League.</TE>
<TE>   'Maybe I'm Naive, but I Still Have Hope'</TE>
<TE>   Despite what Mack said was widespread cynicism in the black
community about the commission's process in evaluating the chief,
Mack went so far Tuesday as to say that, "Maybe they are serious.
Maybe I'm naive, but I still have hope."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, black activists who had planned civil disobedience in
front of Parker Center to protest the commission's decision to
interview the chief in closed session postponed such plans. "Chief
Parks made a comment that so far the hearings are going good, so we
don't want to do anything to disrupt them," said Najee Ali, executive
director of Project Islamic HOPE.</TE>
<TE>   The chief's opponents confined their activities to public comments
at the commission's open session, raising concerns about departures
of officers from the LAPD, rising crime and community policing
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The appearance of the chief's lawyer Monday caused a stir. The
move delayed the start of the interview, as commissioners debated
whether it was proper to allow the lawyer to sit in. Assistant City
Atty. Mark Burton advised them that under the rules that govern
closed sessions, "the only people who are allowed to be there for a
closed session are the people who are necessary for the board to make
its decision."</TE>
<TE>   After a brief discussion, in which commissioners said they would
not conduct the session with Parks' lawyer present, the chief
relented. The meeting resumed after his lawyer left.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he had sought to have his lawyer sit in on the session
the previous day, a fleeting, wan smile crossed Parks' face.
"Everyone has a lawyer," he quipped. But he declined to comment
further or identify the lawyer, calling it "a private matter."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners apparently never learned the lawyer's name. "He
mumbled his name, and no one knew who it was," said Joe Gunn,
commission executive director. Commissioners were taken aback, he
said, adding: "It's a job interview, and for a job interview you
don't bring an attorney."</TE>
<TE>   The incident was the second strategic curveball the chief had
thrown at the commission since last week, when he requested that his
job interview be held in open session. Commissioners considered the
request, then denied it on the advice of the city attorney's office,
whose advisor said that the likely discussion of sensitive
deployment, officer-involved shootings and personnel matters
involving people other than Parks would preclude an open session.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said Tuesday he had made the request because he believed it
was in the public's interest to hear his response to the commission,
but was "not upset" that the session remained closed.</TE>
<TE>   After the two days of meetings wrapped up late Tuesday afternoon,
three commissioners, including commission President Rick Caruso, went
out of their way to praise the chief, saying he had given a good
presentation.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief interview with The Times after the meeting, Parks
shrugged off the suggestion that the situation had been a tense one.
"Another day in heaven," he said. "No reason to be nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Parks said he talked to commissioners about each of several
performance criteria they had specified, ranging from management to
crime control measures.</TE>
<TE>   He said his proudest accomplishment was to lower crime levels in
Los Angeles. Violent crime in Los Angeles followed a downward
national trend during the 1990s, then edged back up at the end of the
decade. But it has remained substantially below the very violent
years of the late 1980s and 1990s, when new and disputed crack
cocaine markets exploded across the city, leaving a trail of
bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   New York Program Emulated by Chief</TE>
<TE>   Parks' efforts to control crime focused on a program he instituted
called FASTRAC, in which commanders in different areas of the city
are called to account for statistical data showing crime trends on a
neighborhood level.</TE>
<TE>   The effort is based on a model employed in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said his second proudest accomplishment was forging better
relationships with constituencies in Los Angeles previously alienated
from the police--especially gays, Koreans and Central American
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Although Caruso said Parks had frankly discussed his weaknesses
with the commission, Parks demurred on this question in a subsequent
interview, saying only that "everything, we can do better."</TE>

<HD>Jury Awards Homeowners $17 Million</HD>
<DH>Courts: Anaheim is told to pay 14 families who lived near a
leaking reservoir that caused landslides. City expects the judgment
to be reduced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Anaheim must pay $17 million to the owners of 14 homes
that were destroyed after water leaking from a city reservoir
triggered landslides in their Orange neighborhood, a jury decided
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The award comes four years after water from the Olive Hills
Reservoir began undermining the soil beneath homes in the upscale
Vista Royale development. To prevent a landslide from swallowing the
entire tract, 14 homes were demolished.</LD>
<LD>   A separate jury last year found Anaheim liable for destabilizing
the slope. As a result of that decision, a judge ordered Anaheim to
pay the tract's developer $10.3 million. A third jury will be
impaneled this summer to decide whether the owners of homes that were
damaged but not destroyed deserve compensation as well.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday's verdict centered on the 14 homes that had to be
demolished so that workers could stabilize the slope. The homeowners
charged that the city was negligent in its maintenance of the
reservoir and should have fixed the leaks before they caused problems
for residents.</TE>
<TE>   The homeowners also alleged that Anaheim failed to adequately
compensate them for their property losses as well as emotional
distress.</TE>
<TE>   The jury appeared to take their complaints to heart, awarding the
vast majority of plaintiffs with $300,000 each for emotional distress
alone, in addition to other damages.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy, this is far beyond what any of us expected," said
Christine Salyer, who watched her home razed in 1999. "We were given
just five days to move out of our house before it was taken.... Up to
this point the city hasn't given us a dime."</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners like Salyer said that even though they were forced from
their homes, they still had to maintain mortgage and insurance
payments. The settlements that displaced residents received from the
developer were far less than the value of their homes, she added.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the city said they expect Orange County Superior Court
Judge John C. Woolley to reduce the $17-million judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "In some cases, people have received insurance payments or
settlements already, and the award will be reduced by those amounts,"
said Larry Newberry, Anaheim's senior assistant city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Newberry decline to comment further, adding: "The city's position
is that we're going to wait for the entire case to be over before we
say anything."</TE>
<TE>   The Vista Royale neighborhood, developed in the late 1980s in the
foothills east of the Costa Mesa Freeway, drew well-to-do young
families to the hillside houses costing up to $300,000. Many of the
homes commanded views of the sprawling reservoir, which appeared
sound to the naked eye.</TE>
<TE>   However, residents began to worry about 1997 when large fissures
began creeping through lawns and driveways and sidewalks began to
buckle.</TE>
<TE>   Upon investigation, experts declared that the hillside could
collapse at any moment. Homeowners were told to remove irreplaceable
items from their houses and to be prepared to evacuate on short
notice.</TE>
<TE>   The reservoir has since been drained, and the land around Vista
Royale has stabilized.</TE>
<TE>   The damage to the slope has also affected the owners of homes not
destroyed. In the nearby Peralta Pointe neighborhood, property owners
argue that the softened earth has decreased their property values.
This summer a jury will determine whether they deserve compensation
from the city.</TE>

<HD>County May Hire Home-Care Aides</HD>
<DH>Labor: Supervisors tentatively agree to act as 'employer of
record' so workers can bargain for higher pay, benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Board of Supervisors tentatively agreed Tuesday to
act as employer of record for 1,600 home-care workers as they press
for better pay and training.</LD>
<LD>   Home-care workers help elderly and disabled people who would
otherwise be placed in nursing homes. Until now, they have acted as
independent contractors earning little more than minimum wage.</LD>
<LD>   But a statewide push to unionize the workers and place them under
the authority of a public entity resulted in the issue being brought
before the supervisors.</LD>
<TE>   A county labor group that is trying to organize the workers urged
supervisors to speed the process so negotiations for higher wages can
begin this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Home-care workers earn $7.11 an hour and have no medical coverage.
Leaders of Service Employees International Union Local 998 have said
they will push for a $9.50 hourly wage, plus health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors unanimously agreed, in concept, to take on
responsibility as the workers' employer. State legislation mandates
that counties name an "employer of record" by Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   But some board members said they are concerned about how much the
decision will cost the county. They asked staff members to research
the fiscal effect and report back when the issue returns for a final
vote in two months.</TE>
<TE>   Labor activists and home-care workers pressed for the change,
saying it would bring "economic justice" to a low-paid and largely
ignored group of health-care providers.</TE>
<TE>   Lillian Sharples, an Oxnard home-care worker, said the job she
does results in lower public costs than if a patient is
institutionalized.</TE>
<TE>   "In-home workers are the ones who do the dirty job that no one
else wants to do," Sharples said.</TE>
<TE>   Their care is also better, Sharples and others said. While
nurse-to-patient ratios at nursing homes hover near 8 to 1, home-care
workers usually care for just one person.</TE>

<HD>On a Crusade for Peace</HD>
<DH>Religion: New Episcopal Bishop Jon Bruno knows the costs of
violence firsthand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When newly installed Episcopal Bishop Jon Bruno brings his crusade
against violence to a Los Angeles forum this week, he will offer more
than academic knowledge about the problem's devastating impact.</LD>
<LD>   As a Burbank police officer, Bruno shot and killed a man in what
authorities deemed a justifiable homicide. But he says the nightmares
that woke him up in tears and sweat did not go away for a year until
he went to confession and completed church rituals of reconciliation.</LD>
<LD>   Years earlier, as a 12-year-old boy, he says, he was brutally
beaten by an older neighbor--an experience he says was so traumatic
that it sent him into years of periodic therapy.</LD>
<TE>   "I swore when I got to be an adult ... I would never let anyone
hurt a child again,'' said Bruno, 55, who became bishop of the
six-county Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles in December. "I can't do
it all myself, but if I teach people not to hurt one another, they'll
teach others and we'll start a snowball rolling.''</TE>
<TE>   Targeting youth and family violence as the first major focus of
his episcopate, Bruno's campaign reflects the kinetic, hands-on
approach this beefy, 6-foot-4 former football player intends to take
as chief pastor to 85,000 Southland Episcopalians.</TE>
<TE>   The bishop will preside over a teach-in on violence prevention
Saturday at 9:30 a.m. at St. John's Church, 514 W. Adams Blvd.,
southwest of downtown. The forum is the last of the diocese's six
regional meetings bringing together community members with experts on
child abuse, gang crime, domestic violence and other specialties.</TE>
<TE>   Bruno plans to take his "Hands in Healing'' program beyond the
Southland. In a cross-country trek with 12 young survivors of
violence, he will travel for seven weeks to several infamous places
of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Using the stops as occasion for community meetings and theological
reflections, the group will visit places ranging from ground zero in
New York City to the site where gay college student Matthew Shepard
was strung to a fence and left to die in Wyoming. In the rust belt of
Detroit and the bread basket of Omaha, Neb., the group will focus on
the violent consequences of economic cutbacks, plant closures and
family farm failures.</TE>
<TE>   Two young adults who grew up under apartheid in South Africa will
join the tour. So will Luis Garibay, a former gang member and drug
abuser who now works as head custodian at the Cathedral Center of St.
Paul, a job he got through Bruno.</TE>
<TE>   The national tour will climax on May 26, when Bruno is scheduled
to preach on violence prevention at the National Cathedral in
Washington. Diocesan officials plan to videotape all of the events
and eventually craft an interactive, on-line curriculum on violence
prevention.</TE>
<TE>   "What I felt God calling me to do in prayer was deal with that
which causes the most pain in our society. After working with gangs
for 17 years, I know what that pain is," Bruno said during a recent
interview at his Cathedral Center office in Echo Park. "I want to
teach people to be lovers of the holy in their lives and lovers of
the rest of humanity."</TE>
<TE>   If a seven-week cross-country trek with young adults seems an
unusual enterprise for a busy Episcopal bishop, Bruno says such
personal investment of time is "what changes people."</TE>
<TE>   He himself was transformed, he says, when a priest named Morrie
Samuel took him to one of his first civil-rights marches in Selma,
Ala., in the mid-1960s. Since then, Bruno has worked on civil-rights
causes with people ranging from the late United Farm Workers chief
Cesar Chavez to, more recently, hotel and restaurant workers
organizing for higher wages in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   He has helped launch a range of entrepreneurial projects, from a
program to support street vendors in MacArthur Park to a community
credit union to the Cathedral Center complex itself.</TE>
<TE>   A painting of a boy with large, pensive eyes, drawn by the late
artist Michael Gonzalez, dominates Bruno's office. He said the first
time he saw the portrait 11 years ago he saw in it himself, the
12-year-old boy who wondered why he'd been brutalized.</TE>
<TE>   "The picture reminds me of the fact that every child is
vulnerable,'' he said. "I'm a survivor, and I don't want any other
children in this world to have to learn to be survivors too.''</TE>

<HD>City Will Keep Job Center Open, but Users Will Pay</HD>
<DH>Hiring: Costa Mesa raises fees for day laborers and imposes
one on contractors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H. G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Day laborers lined up for work Tuesday at Costa Mesa's job center, a
day after the City Council voted to keep the facility open and charge
contractors a fee for using the hiring hall.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting outside on metal chairs in the chilly morning air, job
seekers--113 of them by day's end--waited for contractors and other
prospective employers to drive by the old gas station that has served
as a hiring hall for 13 years.</LD>
<LD>   The job center, though, has been a lightning rod for controversy,
and critics have asked that it be closed down.</LD>
<TE>   But the council voted 4 to 1 on Tuesday to keep funding the
city-owned center and impose a fee on contractors beginning July 1,
Deputy City Clerk Mary Elliott said. Officials have not set the
contractor fee, but workers who live in the city will be required to
pay $10 a year. Job seekers who live outside the city will pay $15.</TE>
<TE>   Nonresidents and locals alike currently pay a one-time $5
registration fee, center coordinator Christina Sanchez said. The new
workers fees will also go into effect July 1.</TE>
<TE>   The center has a reputation as one of the best-run facilities of
its kind in Orange County, and police say it thins out the groups of
unemployed men who gather in parks or other public places looking for
short-term employment.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the center promotes illegal employment because some of
the workers are in the U.S. illegally and are prohibited from working
by Immigration and Naturalization Service rules. Some neighbors
complain that the center, at the corner of 18th Street and Placentia
Avenue, attracts poor people and workers who live outside the city.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, city officials estimated that 35% or 40% of the laborers
who used the facility were nonresidents. Most are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   The hiring hall is open from 6 to 11 a.m. Monday through Saturday.
Each prospective worker is given a number after registering and
required to wait outside.</TE>
<TE>   Contractors pull up in front and tell a center employee how many
workers they need and the type of job they will be doing. Workers
qualified to do the work then raise their numbers, and contractors
pick by number.</TE>
<TE>   Job centers like the one in Costa Mesa also offer workers some
protection from unscrupulous employers. Contractors are required to
register whenever they pick up a worker. While employers do not have
to provide employee benefits, like disability insurance, the centers
take legal action against employers who cheat workers out of wages.</TE>

<HD>CSUCI Receives Gift for Center</HD>
<DH>Education: Former congressman Robert Lagomarsino and his
wife donate $1 million to the new university's archives department,
to be named for the couple.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former congressman Robert J. Lagomarsino and his wife, Norma, have
donated $1 million to support an archives department in a new library
planned for the fledgling Cal State Channel Islands.</LD>
<LD>   The gift will help the university develop and maintain the
Department of Archives and Special Collections, to be named after the
couple. It will include tens of thousands of papers, photographs and
awards generated during Lagomarsino's 34 years in elected office.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a big deal," university President Richard Rush said. "It's a
wonderfully generous gesture on the part of the Lagomarsinos, and
it's another clear testament to the support this region has for a
public four-year university."</LD>
<TE>   Lagomarsino, who began his political career as Ojai's mayor and
went on to serve 19 years in the House of Representatives, said the
couple's gift was a logical extension from the donation of his
archives in 1998. But he and his wife also see the gift as a "thank
you" to their parents.</TE>
<TE>   "My father was very industrious, very hard-working and very
successful," said Lagomarsino, who lives in Solimar Beach, just north
of Ventura. "As a consequence of that, we have money and funds we
wouldn't have. It's a great opportunity, not only to help the
university, but in our way, to honor them."</TE>
<TE>   Added Norma Lagomarsino: "It's a real tribute and we feel honored
to be able to do it."</TE>
<TE>   When Robert Lagomarsino in 1961 introduced the first legislation
authorizing a public university in Ventura County, it was "just a
dream," he said. He has backed the effort ever since, and said he is
excited to see it finally coming together.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will be one of the finest four-year universities in
the state, if not the country," he said. "We have the kind of
population that really will benefit from it."</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Channel Islands will open to upper-division students for
the first time this fall. Its planned 250,000-square-foot,
state-of-the-art library and media center--much of which will be
funded by revenues from an adjacent faculty housing project--is
expected to open in 2005, Rush said.</TE>
<TE>   The library and media facility will be named the John Spoor Broome
Library, after the Oxnard rancher who gave $5 million to the
university in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope the building will become the centerpiece for the
new university, which occupies the grounds of the old Camarillo State
Hospital.</TE>

<HD>Teachers' Dress Code Questioned</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: District trustee wants to review vague policy after
hearing about some instructors wearing shorts in class.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The wardrobes of elementary and middle school teachers in Oxnard
could come under scrutiny tonight as district leaders consider
whether their dress code for educators is strict enough.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard School District trustee Bill Thrasher said he asked that
the policy be reviewed after hearing concerns about the way some
teachers dress.</LD>
<LD>   Someone told him several teachers were wearing shorts at a recent
public event, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not sure they should have to wear ties or long skirts," he
said, "but I want to have a discussion about it."</TE>
<TE>   The dress code, adopted in 1991, requires adults who work in
Oxnard schools to be "appropriately attired and well-groomed" to
serve as positive role models for students and reflect a professional
image in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Such wording may be too vague, Thrasher said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not specific in what they're supposed to wear," he said. "It
says they should dress appropriately and in a professional manner,
but I definitely don't think any professional person should wear
shorts."</TE>
<TE>   District Supt. Richard Duarte agreed that shorts are not
appropriate for most classroom teachers but said he does not believe
that is an issue in the city's schools.</TE>
<TE>   He has not received any complaints about teachers' attire, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our foremost concern is that students are provided with an
appropriate role model," Duarte said. "We also have to be careful to
preserve the individual rights of teachers."</TE>
<TE>   The school board meets at 6 tonight at district offices, 1051
South A St., Oxnard.</TE>

<HD>Fish Odor Could Halt Water Project</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County water official is asking his own agency to
reconsider a project that is expected to kill thousands of fish--and
send the resulting putrid odor into Villa Park and Orange.</LD>
<LD>   "Subjecting the residents of Orange and Villa Park to the stench
of rotting fish for up to eight months is completely unacceptable to
me," Denis Bilodeau complained in a letter this week to the Orange
County Water District's acting general manager. "I am requesting that
the staff reanalyze this project, halt construction if necessary, and
develop a solution to the fish-kill problem."</LD>
<LD>   Bilodeau represents the two cities for the district, which
provides water for about 2.2 million people in northern and central
Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   The project involves draining Santiago Pits to install a pumping
station at the bottom. Although many of the fish in the pits would be
moved to nearby lakes, agency officials concede that the odor will be
noticeable to nearby residents.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, preventing a fish smell will be virtually
impossible," Cindy Ferch, a senior public affairs specialist with the
district, wrote in a March 29 letter intended for 800 homes within
half a mile of the pits. "At best, we can only try to mitigate the
duration and intensity of the smell."</TE>
<TE>   The Santiago Pits are former sand and gravel mines now used to
hold water that then percolates into the aquifer. The large pits are
up to 150 feet deep with sheer walls and can hold about 4.6 billion
gallons of water. They are fed by the Santa Ana River and imported
water.</TE>
<TE>   The $5-million project would allow the district to pump water to
other percolation fields, said Craig Miller, the district's director
of recharge and wetland operations.</TE>
<TE>   But first, much of the water must be pumped out of the pits, a
process that began in March. And therein lies the problem. The pits
are filled with carp, catfish, bass and shad. The water district is
depending on the state Department of Fish and Game to move some of
the fish and is leaving some parts of the pits underwater. But some
fish will die, and the smell could start this month, according to
Ferch's letter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inevitable that some will die and there will be some odor,"
Miller said. He said the agency will use boats, boons and a conveyor
to pull dead fish from the water. Lime and other odor controllers
will be used. Variables such as wind conditions, temperatures and how
quickly the fish die will come into play, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mother Nature is holding all the cards," he said.</TE>

<TE>   He said neither issue was mentioned when the board approved the
project Jan. 16. He learned about it when he saw Ferch's letter in
his district mailbox.</TE>
<TE>   The district decided to hold off on mailing Ferch's letter.
Bilodeau hopes the matter will be discussed at the board's April 17

<HD>Officials Push to Study Alternatives to Expansion of
Landfill in Valley</HD>
<DH>Sanitation: Energy conversion, recycling and remote hauling
of trash could be examined.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn and four City Council members from the San
Fernando Valley proposed Tuesday that the city begin a study to
identify ways to dispose of trash other than expansion of Sunshine
Canyon Landfill.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Hal Bernson, who introduced the motion, said the
alternatives considered should include an incinerator that would
convert trash to energy, possibly at Hansen Dam or next to the
Hyperion Waste Treatment Plant.</LD>
<LD>   ''My first choice, if we were able to do it, would be to go to
energy conversion,'' Bernson said at a City Hall news conference.
''We can find an appropriate location. It doesn't have to be near
residential uses.''</LD>
<TE>   The study, which was supported by council members Alex Padilla and
Dennis Zine and Councilwoman-elect Wendy Greuel, also would look at
alternatives such as hauling refuse by truck or train to remote
desert landfills, including Eagle Mountain in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Other options cited include an expansion of recycling to
commercial and apartment buildings, action that would reduce the
amount of trash dumped into a landfill.</TE>
<TE>   Bernson also suggested the council study the possibility of a
trash pickup fee to pay for alternative measures, something he has
traditionally opposed.</TE>
<TE>   A similar study conducted by the city before the council approved
expansion of Sunshine Canyon in 1999 indicated that use of other
remote landfills would cost much more, said Arnie Berghoff, a
spokesman for Sunshine Canyon operator Browning-Ferris Industries.</TE>
<TE>   ''Any alternative is going to be tremendously expensive,''
Berghoff said.</TE>
<TE>   The city has four years remaining on its contract with BFI for
dumping at Sunshine Canyon, said Berghoff, adding that "we expect
them to honor it.''</TE>
<TE>   Berghoff also cited a waste-to-energy project in Los Angeles that
was abandoned in the 1980s because of public opposition.</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said at the news conference
that pollution-control technology has so improved that the South
Coast Air Quality Management District approved a trash-to-energy
project in Long Beach a decade ago. "And the AQMD is one of the
strictest air-quality agencies in the entire world," Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman said he plans to ask the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to determine whether the landfill is a threat to the nearby
Los Angeles Reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   Trash-conversion plants operating in Japan, Europe and elsewhere
have sophisticated scrubbing systems to remove pollutants, Bernson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bernson's motion awaits a council vote. While he appears to have
the eight votes needed to support a study, Hahn and the other council
members stopped short of endorsing a trash-to-energy plant.</TE>
<TE>   ''We need to look at other alternatives that will lessen the need
for Sunshine Canyon Landfill or any landfill in the city limits of
Los Angeles,'' Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   The city has time to examine alternatives, Hahn said, because it
recently rejected an application from BFI for an operating permit to
expand Sunshine Canyon, saying the paperwork is incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   BFI withdrew its application. The firm said it was still working
on a design plan for expansion into Granada Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the north San Fernando Valley who oppose the dump
expansion said they are grateful the council appears open to
alternatives. Since the council's approval of the expansion, a
majority of council seats have changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   ''We are very happy to see that the city has finally recognized
that there is a serious problem with Sunshine Canyon Landfill,'' said
Wayde Hunter, head of the anti-landfill North Valley Coalition.</TE>

<HD>Group Files Suit to Halt Valley Busway Project</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of Los Angeles residents sued the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority on Tuesday to block construction of an
east-west busway in the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit filed by Citizens Organized for Smart Transit accuses
the MTA of ignoring public concerns about safety and failing to
consider alternatives to the $329.5-million bus corridor.</LD>
<LD>   "The MTA's environmental review of the project was mere window
dressing ... and it utterly deprived both the public and the MTA
board of information essential to an informed decision," according to
the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit accuses the MTA of violating the California
Environmental Quality Act, which requires public agencies to consider
the likely effect of proposed projects.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very high standards for what has to be in an
environmental impact review," said John A. Henning Jr., the Los
Angeles attorney who represents the plaintiffs. "This EIR fails to
meet that standard."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the MTA had not seen the complaint by Tuesday
afternoon. But agency spokesman Rick Jager said that MTA officials
were confident the lawsuit would not be successful.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very careful in following all the environmental processes
set down by the state of California during our environmental review
of the [project]," Jager said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has touted the busway, a 14-mile route from the North
Hollywood Red Line subway station to Warner Center in Woodland Hills,
as "an attractive transit alternative for thousands of commuters."</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, the MTA board approved a three-volume
environmental impact report on the proposed bus corridor, which would
run along a former Southern Pacific railroad path along Burbank and
Chandler boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   "We are proceeding until we're told not to," Jager said, adding
that the MTA is preparing to ask for construction bids in June. The
board is scheduled to award a contract in December, and the busway
would open in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Residents fear a constant stream of buses would bring an onslaught
of noise and create hazards for pedestrians and cars at the route's
intersections with city streets.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's such a dangerous project," said Diana Lipari, the
coalition's chairwoman. "You don't have to live next to the busway to
have to go through the busway."</TE>
<TE>   She also criticized the project for being too costly, saying the
MTA failed to fully investigate the possibility of expanding the
Metro Rapid program, which could provide rapid bus service on
existing streets at a fraction of the cost of a dedicated busway.</TE>
<TE>   Among those listed as plaintiffs are people who own property that
the MTA may have to acquire to make way for the busway. Other
opponents include members of the Orthodox Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been against the project from the start," said Dr. Irving
Steinberg, president of the Shaarey Zedek Congregation, the largest
of at least half a dozen synagogues in the Valley Village area.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg said the busway would endanger many members of the
congregation who would have to walk across the busway to get to the
synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the busway denounced the lawsuit as the latest
attempt to thwart the project--which began years ago as a subway
plan, and then became a light-rail proposal. Funding shortages and
community opposition derailed those ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley sorely needs the busway to help relieve its congested
freeways, said Arthur Sweet, transportation chairman of the United
Chambers of Commerce of San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you driven the freeways lately?" Sweet said. "I don't know
what [the opponents] are thinking."</TE>

<HD>Judges Group Stops Use of Fees for Parties, Gifts</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Superior Court Judges Assn. is no longer using
payments from legal seminars and workshops to finance association
functions, such as retirement parties and gifts, court officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The new policy stemmed from an independent auditor's advice in
December that such fees, paid by lawyers to attend programs
coordinated in conjunction with the county bar association, should
have gone to the court's general fund rather than the judges
association account to pay for miscellaneous expenses, Court Counsel
Frederick Bennett said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The audit, by Simpson &amp; Simpson, found no evidence to suggest
payments into the fund had inappropriately influenced the jurists in
any cases, Bennett said.</LD>
<TE>   The association will now accept money from only the 600 judges who
are members and who pay $10 a month in dues directly from their
paychecks, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes in operation haven't put to rest the 7-year-old
allegations of wrongdoing that prompted presiding Judge James A.
Bascue to order the audit in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of litigants had complained that the financial
relationship among the judges, attorneys and some court-appointed
officials led to unfavorable judgments in family court.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills attorney and taxpayer advocate Richard I. Fine said
Tuesday the only way the association can redeem itself is to repay to
the court all of the money it misappropriated over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "I have great respect for the legal system, and it pains me that
the integrity of the judicial system should be called into question
for something like this," Fine said.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said because the association didn't keep comprehensive
records, it is impossible to determine just how much money should
have gone to the courts over the years. So, in December, the
association's board of directors voted to relinquish its entire
account of $60,000 to the court.</TE>
<TE>   The association was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in
1991, but judges have been operating the fund since about 1960,
Bennett said. Over the years, it has been known as the "Flower Fund,"
because it was used to send flowers to funerals and retirements, and
the "Judges' Fund." In recent years, the fund has paid for bills
including a $6,000 luncheon at the Friars Club, and an $800 limousine
bill for guest speakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Like many organizations, governmental or private, people put
together funds to pool money for things that are of common interest,"
Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   The Christmas parties, retirement dinners and social events are
"perfectly appropriate and legitimate things to do," Bennett said.</TE>

<HD>Council Meeting on Theaters Has SRO Crowd</HD>
<DH>Garden Grove: Actors and fans of the Grove Theater Center
speak out, trying to save it. City, which denied funds request, sets
hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fate of two well-known professional theater venues near downtown
Garden Grove will be in limbo at least through this month, the City
Council decided Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The future of the theaters has been in question since last month,
when the Grove Theater Center, which has been managing the two venues
since 1994, asked the city for $20,000--in addition to the $40,000 it
has been receiving annually since last year--to help promote its
shows.</LD>
<LD>   City officials have already denied the request, contending the
theaters' managers had violated the terms of their contract by not
staging enough events or attracting enough people to the events they
have staged. About 60% of last year's performances, they said,
attracted fewer than 20 people.</LD>
<TE>   At Tuesday's council session, dozens of actors and fans spoke out,
some tearfully, in support of the 172-seat Gem Theater and 550-seat
outdoor Festival Amphitheater, both city-owned facilities that have
served local audiences for more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't take away our favorite theater," said Mabel Houdishell, who
said she has been attending performances there for years. "It's an
icon of our city, and big is not always better. Let's save this gem
for people coming up."</TE>
<TE>   The council set a public workshop on the subject for April 30.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be here tonight if there were this many people at the
... theater," said Mayor Bruce Broadwater of the standing-room-only
crowd in council chambers.</TE>
<TE>   The theaters' operators say the numbers are not the real issue.
"We don't think their numbers are right, but we also don't think the
numbers are the primary issue," said Charles Johanson, the Grove
Center's executive director and chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   "They're saying they want bodies there, but professional theater
is not a quick fix--it's a long-term development process."</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they are considering three options for the
theaters: spending more money to promote them, taking over management
of the theaters or seeking another contractor to run them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the community is still interested in professional
theater," said City Manager George Tindall, who favors having a
citizen panel to study the issue and make recommendations. "But the
whole concept needs to be reviewed."</TE>
<TE>   The small, eclectic theater company produces plays ranging from
Shakespeare to modern original works. To many speaking at Tuesday's
meeting, therein lies the charm.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing quite like this in Orange County," said Don Took,
an actor who said he frequently appears in productions at South Coast
Repertory Theater. "These guys offer really eclectic
programming--they're right on target."</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Ramich, whose daughter Natalie appeared in several Gem
productions, asked the council, "If we don't teach children to be
theater lovers and theatergoers, where will they be as adults?"</TE>

<HD>D.A. Won't File Charges in Car Crash</HD>
<DH>Fatal: Woman whose vehicle hit and killed two girls at
school may still face Anaheim counts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County district attorney's office declined Tuesday to file
felony charges against a woman whose car struck and killed two
children last month outside an Anaheim elementary school.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors chose not to file felony vehicular manslaughter
charges because there was no evidence the woman was under the
influence of drugs or alcohol or driving with gross negligence, said
Tori Richards, a spokeswoman for the district attorney. The Anaheim
city attorney's office, which handles misdemeanor prosecutions in the
city, could still charge Maria Juarez with misdemeanor vehicular
manslaughter. The charge carries a maximum sentence of one year in
county jail.</LD>
<LD>   Senior Assistant City Atty. Mark Logan said his office had not yet
received the case for review.</LD>
<TE>   Juarez told police that she struck the two girls after picking up
her grandchildren at Centralia Elementary School. She said she
mistakenly hit the gas pedal instead of the brake. Her car jumped a
curb and struck Nidia "Liz" Curiel, 6, of Anaheim and Bianca Jasmine
Perez, 7, of Buena Park. Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez said
investigators plan to present the case to the Anaheim city attorney's
office later this week.</TE>

<HD>Panel OKs Pacts to Study LAX Changes</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Consultants will work on federal mandate to have
plans to screen all baggage for explosives by Dec. 31.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city Airport Commission approved several contracts Tuesday with
consultants who will study how to remodel Los Angeles International
Airport to comply with an aviation security law approved by Congress
last fall.</LD>
<LD>   The contracts are part of a series of agreements the airport
agency plans to reach, totaling about $6 million, to satisfy a new
aviation security law. A key component of that law requires all
airports to have plans by Dec. 31 to screen all baggage for
explosives.</LD>
<LD>   The airport agency hopes to get a head start by drawing up its
plans now and submitting them to the new federal Transportation
Security Administration, rather than waiting for the fledgling agency
to issue its own guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   "We have taken a very proactive approach, instead of waiting and
hearing what the TSA wants to do," said Kim Day, an executive
director at the airport agency.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a very daunting task, looking at every airport in
America," Day said. "We think we know LAX best."</TE>
<TE>   Consultants hired by the airport agency will help devise an
interim solution to meet the Dec. 31 deadline for baggage checks.</TE>
<TE>   This plan will incorporate several screening methods including
explosive-detection machines, bomb-sniffing dogs and hand-searching
bags, Day said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime in the next year, Los Angeles World Airports expects to
shift the bulk of the responsibility for bomb detection to the
massive explosive-detection machines.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Los Angeles World Airports calculate that it will
take 124 explosive-detection machines to meet federal mandates.</TE>
<TE>   That's down from the airport's original estimate of 284 machines,
because more efficient screening equipment is expected to be
available this year.</TE>
<TE>   The consultants also will study how to increase passenger
convenience, shorten lines and accommodate more "meeters and
greeters" at facilities operated by the city agency, including
Ontario International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the set of contracts is a $2-million agreement with M.
Arthur Gensler Jr. &amp; Associates to study the most efficient,
effective way to screen bags at all LAX terminals except the Tom
Bradley International Terminal.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Gensler contract, approved at an earlier
meeting, the Airport Commission voted Tuesday to hire Parsons
Brinckerhoff Aviation Inc., which will receive about $600,000 to
study these issues in the Tom Bradley International Terminal, and
CH2M Hill, which will be paid $1.6 million to conduct similar studies
at Ontario International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The consultants will begin their task by studying how many
passengers and bags are screened each hour in each terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Then they will determine how much, and what types of security
equipment are needed to accommodate the demand.</TE>
<TE>   They also must decide how to integrate the equipment into existing
baggage systems.</TE>
<TE>   At its next meeting on April 16, the commission will consider a
fourth contract, with Bechtel/JGM, to review security in the airfield
and around the perimeter at LAX. This contract is being negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   The consultant hired to study airport grounds will be asked to
consider how goods move from non-secure facilities onto the airfield.</TE>
<TE>   The contract also will ask for an analysis of how the airport can
best screen all employees who enter the airfield.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles man pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that he
escaped from jail last summer using a fake identification card that
bore a photo of Eddie Murphy, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Jerome Pullum, 31, walked out of the downtown Twin Towers
Correctional Facility on July 6, hours after he had been convicted of
attempted murder in a Van Nuys courtroom, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   In making his escape, officials said, Pullum wore street clothes
under his jail uniform, which he removed and dumped in a tunnel. He
had just been bused back to the jail from Van Nuys. Pullum, a
three-strikes offender who is serving 65 years in prison as a result
of the attempted murder conviction, spent 16 days eluding
authorities.</LD>

<LD>A man who escaped from a police car on the way to the Orange County
Jail in August was convicted Tuesday of carjacking a catering truck
carrying two women and a child.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Superior Court jury took less that a day to find
Abraham Derian, 26, guilty of three counts of carjacking, one count
of escape and numerous theft charges.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said the Montebello man was in a patrol car on the way
to the jail Aug. 4 when he smashed a back window and jumped out.</LD>
<TE>   Derian's pants were torn off as he fled the car, which was
traveling 40 mph on a freeway onramp.</TE>
<TE>   He then forced his way into the catering truck and ordered the
driver to take him to a store and buy him clothes.</TE>
<TE>   The women called authorities from the store.</TE>
<TE>   Derian had initially been arrested on suspicion of stealing items
from a Newport Beach home.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: (OC)Paramedics attend to Salvation Army workers
suffering from minor eye and throat irritation and nausea following a
hazardous material spill at the Salvation Army Rehabilitation Center
in Anaheim. According to Scott Berg, Anaheim Fire Department division
chief, fumes were created in an area where bicycles are refurbished

an attempt to clean the spill. Haz-mat crews were sent to the center
at 8:56 a.m. Paramedics took 38 of the workers to hospitals.</CP>

<HD>Unlike Mahony, Brown Knows the Virtues of Disclosure</HD>

<LD>Words of praise rang out for Bishop Tod D. Brown. The head of the
Orange County Catholic diocese was lauded for his openness, for
making public what his predecessors hadn't. "There's relief that
disclosure has become part of our Catholic tradition," another
Catholic clergyman said.</LD>
<LD>   That was 15 months ago, after Brown had made available to every
parishioner who attended Sunday church services a detailed four-page
report on the diocese's finances. Even for those not especially
audit-oriented, the report heralded a new era in church candor.</LD>
<LD>   Ah, the good old days when Catholic Church openness meant the
budget.</LD>
<TE>   Here we are just past the Easter season a year later, and Brown
once again has opened up. He's once again talking about things long
kept locked in a drawer.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, he's being praised.</TE>
<TE>   When Brown came to Orange County in mid-1998, he surely never
thought part of his legacy would be how he responded to the explosive
issue of sexual misconduct in the local Catholic clergy.</TE>
<TE>   It will be. And just as Cardinal Roger Mahony in Los Angeles, a
former seminary classmate of Brown's, so far has not quelled the
anger and suspicion surrounding the scandal, Brown largely has.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a difference between the way Cardinal Mahony handled
these allegations as opposed to Bishop Brown," says Katherine
Freberg, an Irvine attorney who has represented two clients who
settled separate lawsuits against priests in the neighboring
dioceses. "Bishop Brown has come forward with the names of priests in
his diocese, which is so important to the victims and really
important to protecting the public. That very fact alone leads me to
believe that Bishop Brown is trying to air out all these issues and
no longer be secretive."</TE>
<TE>   Their religious standing aside, the heads of large dioceses are
also chief executives. When Brown opened the books, he showed
parishioners returns on investments and bottom lines. We probably
shouldn't be surprised that CEOs handle their businesses differently.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Mahony has decried the growing national and local
scandal in the Catholic Church but at times has come across as
defiant or defensive.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has taken another tack.</TE>
<TE>   Freberg hasn't met Brown or Mahony but is struck by their
differing responses. "It's puzzling to me when I see the bishop
acting so differently than Cardinal Mahony," she says. "I don't have
an answer."</TE>
<TE>   That brings us to a lesson that all CEOs should learn in business
school or seminary: When scandal lands at your doorstep, full
disclosure is the only game plan that works.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony hasn't learned that yet, saying he won't release the names
of all known abusers from years past--even though he believes it to
be a small number--because doing so could traumatize the victims
again.</TE>
<TE>   That response, even if he believes it intensely, just won't wash.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time there's not full disclosure," Freberg says, "there's
always distrust there. And there hasn't been full disclosure [from
Mahony]."</TE>
<TE>   Full accounting, Freberg argues, goes beyond merely naming names
from yesteryear. "In talking with victims, they hold the shame for so
long, partly because they think they're the only victims. So many of
them blame themselves. They say, 'This is a priest. How could this
man, who is the closest person we know on Earth to God [be doing
this]? It must be something I did.'"</TE>
<TE>   Realizing there were other victims, Freberg says, helps ease that
shame. "For some reason, it gives them strength to know they're not
the only ones."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Mahony oversees a huge diocese, with four times the
number of parishioners as that in Orange County. That makes him a
powerful, influential figure.</TE>
<TE>   But in these troubled times, that's not enough to keep his
decisions from being questioned.</TE>
<TE>   "I think heads of organizations who are not forthcoming are
concerned about what lies ahead," Freberg says. "I just can't help
but think the reason why Cardinal Mahony is concerned with disclosing
names and [parishes where offending priests served] is because he
thinks it would open the floodgates."</TE>
<TE>   One woman's opinion, and she may be dead wrong. But you can't
blame her or anyone else for thinking it out loud.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has a lot on his mind. This would be a good time for a call
to his old classmate, Tod Brown.</TE>

<LD>Let's play the Supreme Court game. Who wants to be chief justice?
There's your game piece, the one with the gold stripes. OK now, who
wants to be Clarence Thomas? Sandra Day O'Connor? David Souter?</LD>
<LD>   First case: Who do you side with, a California company that
illegally fired an employee for exercising his right to hand out
union cards at work, or the worker himself, a Mexican man who used a
friend's birth certificate to get his job illegally?</LD>
<LD>   Bzzzzt--wrong! Read my briefs--the company trumps the worker.</LD>
<TE>   The Beltway Nine are spending a lot of time on California cases.
By autumn, they will decide whether California's three-strikes law is
"cruel and unusual" when it locks up ex-cons for decades for outrages
like filching seven videotapes from Kmart, an offense that will make
the 43-year-old man in question eligible for parole when he is 87.
(He should have saved himself the trouble and waited for the Kmart
bankruptcy sale.)</TE>
<TE>   The busy, busy court just wrapped up that California union-card
case: Hoffman Plastic Compounds vs. National Labor Relations Board.
Against the wishes of the Bush administration, the justices took the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Five to four, they decided last week that the worker's offense of
illegally using a friend's Texas birth certificate to get hired "by
criminal fraud" was greater than the company's offense of violating
federal labor practices by firing him for handing out union cards.</TE>
<TE>   So instead of having to fork over $67,000 for three years' back
pay to the man, the company can instead lay out a few hundred on
printing up and posting a notice to its employees about their rights.
Imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps they're already on the phone to Erwin Chemerinsky about
that "cruel and unusual" part.</TE>
<TE>   "Hoffman Plastic Compounds of Paramount, Calif."--baby boomer that
I am, I think of Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate" and the magic word
whispered to the young man on his way up: "plastics."</TE>
<TE>   That was the 1960s, and Hoffman Plastic looks like the 1960s, the
high-five days of the Cold War. Its building is painted gray-white
and trimmed in blue, like a ship, or a jet.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount's foundries and refineries and metal-plating shops were
the white-hot heart of the industrial cities that were the assembly
line for the Jet Age, the Space Age, the race to the moon, for
American know-how and American can-do.</TE>
<TE>   Now the trailer park across the street advertises new homes for
$59,999, se habla espanol. The few words I caught squawking through
the shop loudspeaker at Hoffman were in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of miles away is a Home Depot, the kind of place where
men who speak Spanish wait for casual day-laboring jobs. No questions
are asked, no answers are volunteered, and the only papers that
change hands in their transactions are $20 bills. Just another
business day in California, home of probably half of the nation's 7
million or 8 million or 11 million illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   It's California's Prohibition, and it's gone on for decades.
Illegal immigration makes us righteous and crafty. Gotta stop those
hordes--unless stopping them means no more 99-cent romaine and
$200-a-week nannies. It's illegal, it's immoral, it's a tax drain, or
it's necessary, it's healthy, it invigorates the economy--for every
study there's an equal and opposite study, so take your pick.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time that businesses rolled out the bienvenidos mat
for bargain-</TE>
<TE>   basement workers, labor leaders--including Cesar Chavez--agonized
over illegal immigration:</TE>
<TE>   How to keep union ranks strong when the next truck north brings
men willing to work longer and cheaper?</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, President Bush, trying to mend broken GOP fences,
flirted with the idea of amnesty--</TE>
<TE>   "regularization"--for illegal immigrants and hated the idea of the
Supreme Court taking this case.</TE>
<TE>   An anti-illegal-immigration group agreed, because the ruling could
make hiring illegal workers more attractive.</TE>
<TE>   Within 48 hours of the ruling, a Brooklyn immigrants group called
Make the Road by Walking said a Manhattan meat market it's battling
over wage issues warned it --erroneously--that "any demonstration by
your organization on behalf of [the worker] will be in violation of
federal law, and my client will pursue direct action against your
organization."</TE>
<TE>   To my nonlegal mind, all this sounds like letting one wrongdoer
off the hook because he didn't know his victim had already broken the
law.</TE>
<TE>   It's too much for me. I have to turn to a great legal mind, my
grandmother, who ruled in the case of Morrison Brother vs. Morrison
Sister, "Two wrongs don't make a right."</TE>

<HD>Promises to Put Secession on Ballot Being Put to the Test</HD>
<DH>Politics: Many elected officials are rethinking their
support as breakup begins to look possible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The contention by the state controller that the harbor area would not
be financially healthy if it split from Los Angeles puts local
elected officials on the spot, raising the possibility that the
measure will not make the November ballot despite promises that it
would.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since secession became a prominent issue in the mid-1990s,
most Southern California politicians have given lip service to the
idea that such proposals to break up the city should be put before
the voters.</LD>
<LD>   But now, with both Controller Kathleen Connell and the Local
Agency Formation Commission raising serious questions about the
viability of a harbor-area city, those promises will be put to the
test.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Los Angeles officials continue to fight the proposals
at the procedural level. On Tuesday, Mayor James K. Hahn raised
formal objections to key terms and conditions being considered for
the San Fernando Valley, harbor and Hollywood cityhood proposals. He
also sought a six-month delay for the new municipalities to begin
operating.</TE>
<TE>   A letter from the mayor, to be acted on today by the Los Angeles
City Council, also disputes a finding by the LAFCO executive director
that the agency can require the city to charge residents of the new
cities the same water and power rates paid by residents of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   ''We do not believe that LAFCO has the legal authority to impose a
condition related to the setting of utility rates by Los Angeles,''
Hahn wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that the new cities should not have extra time to pay
for such expensive services as police and fire protection--and that
Los Angeles should be allowed to cut them off if they don't pay
promptly.</TE>
<TE>   The city continued to insist that a new Valley city would owe Los
Angeles $300 million a year in so-called alimony payments, money
meant to replace lost revenue and extra costs incurred if the region
breaks away, despite insistence by LAFCO and Connell that such a
payment would be excessive.</TE>
<TE>   The council is scheduled to consider two reports by City
Administrative Officer William Fujioka that maintain that Valley and
harbor cityhood proposals would cause financial harm to the remainder
of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE, the organization working
to put a Valley secession proposal on the ballot, accused the city of
trying to thwart the process ''by making unreasonable demands.''</TE>
<TE>   Close's concern goes to the heart of the dilemma facing Hahn and
other elected officials as the threat of secession appears more
realistic.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO, which oversees the creation of new cities and evaluates
secession proposals, has said it intends to put all three secession
measures on the November ballot if they meet state standards.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, most members of the City Council and several Los Angeles
County supervisors have for years favored letting voters decide on
secession issues.</TE>
<TE>   During the years when secession seemed a distant possibility, most
elected officials refrained from criticizing the idea even if they
opposed it, in part to avoid alienating the typically middle-class
voters who they believed supported it.</TE>
<TE>   But now, with questions raised about the financial health of a
proposed city in the harbor area, some elected officials have started
to back away from the idea.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, LAFCO released a report that said it would place the
harbor-area secession measure on the ballot only if proponents could
prove that they could raise more money than originally projected.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Mardesich, who chairs the harbor secession effort, said the
group had put together a new budget and was working with the
commission to show that a harbor city could survive on its own.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) said he
still thinks that the harbor-area proposal should go before the
voters because petitioners gathered enough signatures to place it on
the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But if the political winds change, and LAFCO members, who are
themselves elected officials from a variety of jurisdictions, begin
to see that harm could come from putting a wobbly proposal on the
ballot, harbor cityhood supporters could lose their backers.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Zev Yaroslavsky, one of two county supervisors on the
LAFCO board and a key architect of the board's position on secession,
has said he would not support placing the harbor measure on the
ballot if proponents could not convince him that their idea for
cityhood could work financially.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman and LAFCO board member Cindy Miscikowski, who opposes
secession, said Tuesday that the mayor's letter and accompanying
report raise significant concerns that LAFCO must address before
deciding whether to put any cityhood proposals on the November
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   There could be some political fallout if the measures do not make
the ballot. Voters could become angry at officials--particularly
Hahn--who seemed to be promising a vote and then pulled their
support.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, there are signs that secession may be picking up
new friends.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden, who has objected to breaking up the city,
indicated that he may vote against the Hahn letter.</TE>
<TE>   People in his district believe that if some regions break away,
his central city area would have more political ''juice'' in a
downsized Los Angeles, he said.</TE>

<HD>Moorpark May Gear Up Inspections of Trucks</HD>
<DH>Safety: Council members believe keeping the California 118
checkpoint open longer would reduce big-rig traffic on New Los
Angeles Avenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Moorpark City Council is set tonight to discuss expanding the
hours of the California 118 truck inspection facility, the latest
move in a decade-long battle to reduce the number of big rigs
rumbling through town along New Los Angeles Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Keith Millhouse wants to find money to keep the station
just west of town open eight hours a day on weekdays. Lt. Bruce
Moncher with the California Highway Patrol said the facility is
currently open eight hours a day an average of four days a week, but
the schedule varies. Millhouse believes the actual hours are far
fewer.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone I talk to who goes out that way says that thing is never
open," Millhouse said.</LD>
<TE>   Moorpark has been down this road before in seeking to increase
inspections, but the city is at the mercy of Caltrans, which
maintains the inspection facility, and the CHP, which provides the
staff. Concerned that truckers choose California 118 over the Ventura
Freeway to avoid the round-the-clock inspection facility on the
Conejo Grade, city officials have lobbied for 24-hour-a-day
inspections at the station near Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   But nighttime inspections would require lighting and other
upgrades, in addition to increased staff.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the City Council asked Caltrans to ban trucks
from the road altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been frustrating because we don't have any control over that
stretch of roadway," Millhouse said.</TE>
<TE>   Moncher said the CHP provides as much coverage of the inspection
site as it can and would provide more if it had sufficient staff.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,900 trucks travel the road each day, according to the
Ventura County Transportation Commission. Officers currently inspect
about 10 trucks a day when the station is open, looking for safety
violations, required paperwork and signs of possible terrorist
threats, Moncher said. By comparison, from 50 to 75 trucks are
inspected daily at the Conejo Grade, CHP Lt. Jeff Goodwin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We agree with Moorpark 100% that it's valuable to be out there.
It's a very heavily traveled commercial route, and we understand
that," Moncher said.</TE>
<TE>   Millhouse estimates the total cost of staffing the facility 40
hours a week and paying for utilities would be about $236,000
annually; he said he doesn't know the current costs. He added that
the city should request county, state and federal funds to help cover
the increased expense.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Clint Harper said he'd support increasing the hours but
questioned the effect of merely expanding daytime operation during
the week while the Ventura Freeway station is open around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't do what some of my colleagues think it would," Harper
said. "The truckers are very astute. They know which [stations] are a
threat and which ones aren't.... We need full-time inspection
stations."</TE>
<TE>   Moncher said there are other reasons truckers choose New Los
Angeles Avenue over the Ventura Freeway. They can avoid the steep
curves of the Conejo Grade, and the surface street is near farms and
rock quarries they need to reach.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems to me we should be able to give it a try and see if
it does work," Millhouse said. "I guess I'd rather try and fail than
fail to try."</TE>

<HD>Train Kills Man in Apparent Suicide</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 20-year-old man died in an apparent suicide when he was hit by a
Red Line subway train in Hollywood Tuesday afternoon, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The incident, which happened shortly after noon at the Hollywood
and Highland station, temporarily shut down parts of Los Angeles'
subway system and created delays through the afternoon for trains
heading to and from the San Fernando Valley, said Gary Wosk, a
spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</LD>
<LD>   The victim's name was not released, pending notification of his
family.</LD>
<TE>   The man "laid himself over the tracks and let the train hit him,"
said LAPD Sgt. John Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously a tragedy," Wosk said. "Tragic for the person who
died, tragic for the people who were at the station at the time,
tragic for the operator of the train."</TE>
<TE>   The incident shut down the Red Line from North Hollywood to
downtown Los Angeles for about half an hour. Partial service was
restored, with trains sharing a single track for about four hours.</TE>
<TE>   The death was the third fatality to occur on the Red Line since it
opened in 1993, Wosk said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the MTA's Blue Line opened in 1990, 59 people have been
killed by Blue Line trains, which run mostly at street level between
downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Line has more than 120,000 weekday boardings.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County supervisors are threatening to pull out of a committee
that meets monthly to discuss regional issues, saying the group no
longer has focus and costs too much.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors agreed to send a letter to the Ventura County Council
of Governments stating that the county intends to withdraw unless the
group can refine its goals and negotiate lower costs for members.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Judy Mikels said it makes no sense to continue
participation unless the group, made up of representatives from the
county and its 10 cities, identifies specific issues to tackle.</LD>

18-year-old William Zara.</LD>
<LD>   Ramiro Salgado, 22, is the last of five defendants to stand trial
in the death of Zara, who was bludgeoned outside his apartment by
gang members who mistakenly thought he had reported their noisy party
to police.</LD>
<LD>   The four other defendants, who were charged months before police
uncovered evidence of Salgado's alleged involvement, were convicted
of murder last year.</LD>

<LD>State and federal officials searched Tuesday for a missing
13-year-old Panorama City girl thought to be traveling to North
Carolina with a man she met on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Allan Hulst, 25, drove from his home in Jacksonville,
N.C., to pick up Cheyenne Simmons and bring her back to marry him or
live with him, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't believe he means to do her harm," FBI spokeswoman Cheryl
Mimura said.</LD>
<TE>   The girl had been communicating with Hulst in secret by telephone
and computer for several months, Mimura said.</TE>
<TE>   She was last seen by her guardian about 1 a.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Hulst, who is being sought for transporting a minor across state
lines, is described as white, 6 feet tall, weighing 175 pounds, with
black hair and brown eyes.</TE>
<TE>   He has a lazy right eye and is missing his left hand. The girl is
white, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, weighs 155 pounds with blond hair and
blue eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Hulst was driving a 1985 white Chevrolet van with North Carolina
license plate MSY1791. A telephone number is painted in green on one
or both of the front doors, authorities said. The van was last seen
Saturday in Fort Worth, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who may see Hulst, Cheyenne or the van is asked to call the
FBI at (310) 477-6565.</TE>

<HD>Bill Could Aid Uninsured Patients</HD>
<DH>Legislation: A proposal would limit hospital fees for those
without insurance and require that they be told of charity-care
policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a fainting spell in November, Cerritos College student Soklinda
Em landed in a Norwalk hospital emergency room for six hours.</LD>
<LD>   Although her health is now fine, her pocketbook is not.</LD>
<LD>   The hospital bills--totaling $4,572.97 at last count--are now
threatening to ruin the 21-year-old's credit.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just awful," said Em, who quit her job, which provided her
insurance, just a month before her fainting spell.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates say Em's case exemplifies the dilemma of many
uninsured hospital patients in California: Though they can't afford
to pay top dollar for treatment, they are not entitled to discounts
that hospitals give to government programs and insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   At a Sacramento news conference Tuesday, consumer groups rallied
behind proposed legislation that would cap the fees that hospitals
could charge the uninsured. The bill also would require hospitals to
inform all patients of their charity-care policies and check whether
patients are eligible for public insurance programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, hospitals bill the uninsured the highest possible
rate, which is overwhelmingly unaffordable," said Anthony Wright,
organizing director of the consumer group Health Access. "These bills
get sent to collections and ruin the financial futures of these
families, and the hospitals get nothing...."</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante agreed. "Hospitals should be providing
care. They shouldn't be taking advantage of these folks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital industry, however, says that defeating the
legislation is its top priority this year. "We're all-out opposed to
it," said Jan Emerson, spokeswoman for the California Healthcare
Assn., a hospital trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson said society at large, not just hospitals, must deal with
the problems of the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   The state should spend its money to expand public programs,
employers should offer health coverage to more workers, and workers
should purchase insurance when it's offered, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The problems of uninsured patients are well known. In 1999, for
example, nearly 500,000 Americans filed for bankruptcy protection
because of excessive medical bills; that accounted for 40% of
personal bankruptcies that year.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue has gained traction lately. In February, a group of
former patients sued Tenet Healthcare Corp., saying the nation's
second-largest hospital chain overcharged poor and uninsured Latinos
as part of a scheme to take advantage of a federally funded charity
care program.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, based in Santa Barbara, argues that the suits lack merit
and are politically motivated.</TE>
<TE>   Some uninsured Californians say they have tried unsuccessfully to
work out payment arrangements with hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Cano, 67, sought care for a throat infection in August 1998 at
Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, owned by
Tenet. He said he was discharged after five hours, having received
X-rays, a tetanus shot and IV antibiotics. The bill: $1,700.</TE>
<TE>   Cano said he was rebuffed when he tried to negotiate a lesser
payment of $500 or $600. He then ignored the bills and notices. This
year, when he went to refinance his home, he discovered a lien for
$2,800 (including legal fees). He paid the bill last month after
borrowing money from his son.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no money to hire an attorney ... so I let it go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman Greg Harrison said he could not discuss individual
cases because of patient privacy rules. In general, he said, Tenet
pursues liens only as a "last resort."</TE>
<TE>   Susan James, 48, said she doesn't know what to do about the
$302,744 hospital bill that arose after her husband fell from his
roof in November. Jesse James, 42, suffered severe brain damage, and
his wife quit her job as a paralegal to take care of him.</TE>
<TE>   Susan James said Loma Linda University Medical Center initially
told her that she would have to pay the entire bill over time or it
would be turned over to collections. Months later, the hospital told
her about its charity care program, she said, and she is now waiting
to hear if she is eligible.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's going to benefit from ruining my credit," she said. "All
they're going to do is stop me from getting money to feed my husband,
feed myself, get prescriptions and things I need. I would love to go
back to work."</TE>
<TE>   Loma Linda officials declined to comment on the case.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento), who sponsored the charity
care bill, said such stories "have been very, very consistent. We
really need to have [hospitals] step forward and do more. Hospitals
ought not to bear 100% of the social problem that we're facing. I
think they could do better, however, by increasing their percentages
of providing charity care."</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's news conference, Consumers Union unveiled an analysis
of state data showing that hospitals expend an average of 1% of their
operating expenses on charity care. Many hospitals reported no
charity care at all.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital trade group says that all hospitals provide some
degree of charity care, although some don't report it properly.</TE>
<TE>   If patients provide financial documentation, Emerson said,
hospitals try to enroll them in public programs or create a payment
plan. The problem, she said, is that many people don't communicate
with the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "So, the only way that a hospital has to engage them is through a
billing process and, unfortunately, sometimes a collections process.
That's not our goal."</TE>

<HD>Governor's Race Turns to Issue of Health Care</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Simon calls for 'fundamental reform.' Davis
resists 'wholesale changes.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Taking their campaigns to an audience of doctors Tuesday, Republican
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. called for "fundamental
reform" of health care to benefit physicians, while Gov. Gray Davis
cautioned against "wholesale changes."</LD>
<LD>   In back-to-back appearances before the California Medical Assn.,
Simon decried health maintenance organizations and urged less
government involvement in health care. He called for a "market
economy" solution to what he described as a "full-fledged crisis."</LD>
<LD>   Davis focused on his support for abortion rights, which he hopes
to contrast in the campaign with Simon's opposition to abortion.</LD>
<TE>   While many physicians share the governor's views on abortion,
Simon generated an enthusiastic response with his criticism of the
health-care bureaucracy and of lawyers who sue physicians.</TE>
<TE>   "We need fundamental reform," Simon said, adding that in his
solution, "it will be the doctors and the patients whose input will
be most important to me."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Davis proposed a doctors' "bill of rights" ensuring
that insurance companies promptly pay doctors for care they provide
and protecting them against unilateral changes in their contracts. A
spokesman said the idea isn't yet embodied in legislation.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief news conference after his speech, Davis also endorsed
the current health-care system, with some improvements: "If you're
talking about wholesale changes in the way health care is delivered
in this state, patients better beware."</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors lauded Davis' call for a physicians' bill of rights.
And his support of abortion rights could be key in how many
physicians vote in the November election. But Dr. John Barr, a
diagnostic radiologist from Oakland and a Democrat who described
himself as "strongly pro-choice," said, "Simon spoke to issues that
resonated."</TE>
<TE>   "What solutions did [Davis] have? More of the same," added Dr.
Thomas W. LaGrelius of Torrance. "Simon wants to put patients and
doctors back in charge."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's prescription for the health-care system, set forth in a
half-hour speech, included "less bureaucracy, trying to restore the
patient-doctor relationship, private solutions."</TE>
<TE>   He did not specifically say he was embracing the old
fee-for-service system, in which doctors had more control and
patients bore more costs. But he suggested that patients pay more for
routine visits.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who has called for a tax reduction, said he would look
seriously at raising government payments to physicians who treat
people on Medi-Cal, the main state health-care program for the poor,
elderly and disabled.</TE>
<TE>   "Medical providers must be paid fairly and adequately for the
services they provide," Simon said, adding that doctors who provide
care for the needy should receive tax breaks. He also called for
medical savings accounts for people whose employers offer health
insurance, tax credits for people who buy their own insurance and
health-care vouchers for the indigent and workers whose companies
don't provide coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also took a slap at trial attorneys who sue doctors for
malpractice. To the applause of many physicians in the audience, he
vowed to veto legislation changing a 1976 law that caps damages for
pain and suffering at $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   After Davis' speech, the governor left open the possibility that
he might sign legislation altering the malpractice law, but would
offer no specifics: "I'd be opposed to any wholesale changes. I'd be
open to some modest improvements. The health-care system is in a
fragile state.... I might be open to some modest improvements."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who spoke for about 15 minutes, cited accomplishments
including expanding Healthy Families, a state- and federally funded
program for the children of working parents without health insurance.
He also pointed to a new Department of Managed Care, which intervenes
on behalf of patients who have complaints with health maintenance
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "America left fee-for-service for HMOs because of the staggering
cost that was being borne by individuals, the government and the
corporate community," Davis said. "I'm not prepared to abandon the
HMO model. I still believe it can be improved to provide good quality
care and still be fair to the physicians providing that care."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Closes 18,000 Acres in Desert to Off-Roaders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two very different creatures like the Rand Mountains in the Mojave
Desert south of Ridgecrest: dirt bikers and the desert tortoise.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government has tried to keep both happy, designating
land in the mountains' western portion as critical tortoise habitat
but also allowing vehicles and motorcycles on some dirt roads and
trails in the area.</LD>
<LD>   It hasn't worked. The region's tortoise population continues to
decline and dirt bikers continue to venture where they are not
supposed to.</LD>
<TE>   Last week the Bureau of Land Management cracked down on the
off-roaders, closing nearly 18,000 acres in the western Rands to all
motorized traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Not far from Los Angeles County and the southern San Joaquin
Valley, BLM land in the southwestern Mojave has been popular with
off-roaders for decades. But their ability to roar freely through the
creosote brush and up rocky slopes has diminished in the last decade
as the BLM has come under legal pressure to protect tortoise habitat.</TE>
<TE>   The number of open routes was reduced. Barriers and "no-vehicle"
signs were erected in front of trails.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions have been widely flaunted, according to BLM
documents.</TE>
<TE>   A 17-mile fence in the southern portion has been repeatedly cut.
Hay bales and snow fencing have been vandalized or ridden around.
Within six months of the BLM's replanting closed roads with desert
shrubs and ripping up routes to encourage revegetation, nearly 25% of
the sites had been damaged by vandalism and illegal riding.</TE>
<TE>   BLM Ranger Bob Tranter, a law enforcement supervisor in the
Ridgecrest field office, said it's not that off-road use in the
region has skyrocketed. It's that illegal use has become more obvious
with the route closings of the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   And the terrain makes it easy to be a scofflaw. "When you have
just creosote brush communities, people can just drive around,"
Tranter said. Moreover, when they do see rangers, the bikers tend to
take off. "They don't respect us as they would city police," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with last week's closing, which affects 29 miles of routes,
100 miles of roads and trails will remain open to off-roaders in the
Rand Mountains area.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM, which has battled off-roaders in many parts of the
Southern California desert, had no choice but to close the 18,000
acres under a court agreement with the Center for Biological
Diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "This has a lot of illegal use and is a critical habitat," said
Brendan Cummings, an attorney for the biological center.</TE>
<TE>   "Areas that are supposed to be protected for the tortoise have
vehicle tracks everywhere and vegetation destroyed. The whole area is
becoming a spider web of trails."</TE>

<HD>River Search Continues for Bodies of 2 Women</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities continued to search Tuesday for the bodies of two
Torrance women presumed drowned in a spring break boating accident
last week on the Colorado River.</LD>
<LD>   Andrea Goodman and Cherlyn Katsuno, both 19, and several friends
were riding on the open bow of the 21-foot Advantage when it hit
another boat shortly after 8 p.m. March 29 near Parker, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   Several of the nine passengers aboard the Advantage were tossed
into the water upon impact, authorities said. The boat's operator,
Taylor Key of Long Beach, did not see the 24-foot boat and hit it at
about 30 mph, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Boaters near the accident scene rescued several people from the
water, Buckskin (Ariz.) Fire Department Chief Charlie Philpot said.
He described the situation as chaotic. "Everyone was yelling,"
Philpot said. "Boats were moving all around. People were screaming
that someone was missing."</TE>
<TE>   The river's current carried the boats downstream and made it
difficult for divers to pinpoint the location of the accident,
Philpot said. With the injured on different boats, rescuers initially
thought only one woman was missing.</TE>
<TE>   Buckskin fire divers began a search for the woman. They were
joined by the Colorado River Indian Tribal Police and Fire
departments, the La Paz County (Ariz.) Sheriff's Department and other
departments. They later realized that two women were missing.</TE>
<TE>   The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, which is leading
the investigation, called off the diving searches late Monday, but
Buckskin fire officials continued diving Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, we're out there to see if we can find them for
these families," Philpot said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash is under investigation, said Jodi Miller, a
spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   The two women graduated from West High School in Torrance. Friends
said Goodman attended Cal State Long Beach and Katsuno went to El
Camino College.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>State and federal officials searched Tuesday for a 13-year-old
Panorama City girl thought to be traveling to North Carolina with a
man she met on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Allan Hulst, 25, drove from his home in Jacksonville,
N.C., to pick up Cheyenne Simmons and bring her back to marry him or
live with him, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   ''We don't believe he means to do her harm,'' FBI spokeswoman
Cheryl Mimura said.</LD>
<TE>   The girl had been communicating with Hulst in secret by telephone
and computer for several months, Mimura said. She was last seen by
her guardian about 1 a.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Hulst, who is wanted on suspicion of transporting a minor across
state lines, is white, 6 feet, 175 pounds with black hair and brown
eyes. He has a lazy right eye and is missing his left hand. The girl
is white, 5-foot-6, 155 pounds with blond hair and blue eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Hulst was driving a 1985 white Chevrolet van with North Carolina
license plate MSY1791. A telephone number is painted in green on one
or both of the front doors, authorities said. The van was last seen
Saturday in Fort Worth, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who may see Hulst, Cheyenne or the van should call the FBI
at (310) 477-6565.</TE>

Angeles County may have been lost or destroyed by law enforcement
over the past six years, according to the district attorney's
forensic science director.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn said Tuesday she believes that based
on state crime statistics and the average clearance rate for sex
offenses, there could be as many as 3,000 to 4,000 unsolved cases for
which there is no evidence now being stored by the Los Angeles Police
Department or county Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   Kahn said that in applying about two years ago for state funds to
perform DNA tests on cold cases, the LAPD and Sheriff's Department
reported they had preserved the biological evidence for about 2,000
unsolved rapes and slayings involving sexual offenses. Kahn estimates
the agencies should have had evidence for about 6,000 cases.</LD>
<TE>   "The real tragedy is that we will not be able to solve these
cases, and the violent perpetrators of these crimes are still out
there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her comments brought strong denials from authorities who are in
charge of the property and evidence rooms for both agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn's estimates "sound way out of whack to me," said David
Peterson, commanding officer for the LAPD's property and evidence
unit. "I just don't see that happening here."</TE>
<TE>   He and Peter Zavalo, head of the sheriff's evidence unit, said
destruction of evidence in most cases can only be authorized by
investigating officers. They say detectives do not issue such
approvals unless the statute of limitations on the offenses have
expired or the cases have been tried and all appeals completed.</TE>
<TE>   While conceding that her estimates are "soft" because they are
based on extrapolations using statewide statistics from the
Department of Justice, Kahn said, "I believe beyond a reasonable
doubt" they are close.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn says it is important for law enforcement agencies to be
diligent in keeping biological evidence in old cases because major
legal and forensic developments in recent years have given the
material increased importance.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the statute of limitations for sex offenses has
increased in recent years, and a national database of DNA evidence
obtained from prisoners has been expanding exponentially. The more
names in the database, the more likely law enforcement can solve cold
cases, Kahn said.</TE>
<TE>   But she said the cases cannot be solved if agencies destroy rape
kits, semen or blood traces or other biological evidence.</TE>
<TE>   In rejecting Kahn's figures, Peterson said her method for
estimating the amount of missing evidence is "highly dubious" and
that evidence is not destroyed due to lack of storage space.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief justice of the California Supreme Court on Tuesday signed
an order delaying--at least temporarily--the release of a prisoner
who has challenged the governor's refusal to grant him parole.</LD>
<LD>   The action by Chief Justice Ronald M. George means that Mark Smith
will remain locked up until the full court can consider a lower
court's order that he be freed.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, 46, has served 17 years in prison for his role in the
killing of Rick Diamonon, who was shot and then drowned.</LD>
<TE>   Smith, who suffers from AIDS, was cleared for parole by the state
Board of Prison Terms. Gov. Gray Davis reversed the decision,
prompting a suit from Smith, who argues that Davis has a blanket
policy of not paroling murderers.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Keith L. Schwartz
said there was no evidence to support the governor's action and
ordered Smith freed. An appellate court then refused to block his
release.</TE>

<HD>3rd Man Accused in Insurance Dept. Scandal</HD>
<DH>Crime: Businessman, who led a foundation created by Chuck
Quackenbush, faces eight criminal charges, including theft of funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A businessman who as a favor to a friend joined a charitable
foundation created by former Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush
has been charged with eight felonies, including the theft of $18,000
in foundation funds.</LD>
<LD>   State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer filed charges last week against
Ronald Leo Weekley, the former president of the California Research
and Assistance Fund, accusing him of grand theft, perjury, receiving
stolen property and preparing false documents.</LD>
<LD>   Weekley, 49, of Venice, is scheduled to enter a plea to the
charges in Sacramento Superior Court on April 11. He could not be
reached for comment, and Lockyer's office said it has received no
notification that he is being represented by an attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Weekley is the third person to face criminal charges in connection
with the scandal that erupted around Quackenbush after he reached
secret agreements with insurance companies that allowed them to
donate millions of dollars to his foundation instead of paying fines
for mishandling claims from the 1994 Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Quackenbush resigned in the summer of 2000 rather than face
impeachment and has since moved to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Lockyer said the attorney general's
investigation is ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition to the criminal complaint," Sandy Michioku said, "we
are pursuing court action to void the insurance company settlements
stemming from the mishandling of claims in the Northridge
earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   Also charged in the investigation was George Grays, a former
deputy insurance commissioner, who pleaded guilty in federal court to
mail fraud and money laundering. Another defendant, Brian K.
Thompson, a former football coach who operated a camp for troubled
children, is awaiting trial on federal fraud and conspiracy charges.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints That Only Lesser Players Charged</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the investigation has been criticized by lawmakers and
consumer groups who complain that only the lesser players in the
scandal have had to answer to criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   "The sad part is that while the fall guys fell, we don't feel that
justice has truly been served," said Douglas Heller of the Foundation
for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a watchdog group. "There was too
much wrong in the Quackenbush administration to allow the guy in
charge to still be sitting on a beach in Hawaii."</TE>
<TE>   All three defendants have been accused of mishandling the funds of
CRAF, a foundation created under a state law that required it to be
operated by an independent board for charitable purposes. But
evidence gathered by the Assembly Insurance Committee during an
investigation of Quackenbush showed that the foundation was actually
run by Grays, who used its assets to distribute money to his friends
and buy television advertising designed to enhance Quackenbush's
political career.</TE>
<TE>   Weekley, as a favor to his friend Grays, served first as the
foundation's treasurer and later as its president.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's complaint says that Weekley, as an officer of the
foundation, approved an $18,000 payment to Community Connections, a
consulting business that was "created and owned by the defendant."</TE>
<TE>   The complaint accuses Weekley of lying about the payment on a
state financial disclosure statement claiming Community Connections
had earned less than $250 in 1999 when in fact it had received
$18,000 that year from the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint says Weekley later created a false invoice and work
plan to justify the payment.</TE>
<TE>   Weekley is also charged with the grand theft of a state computer,
which officials said they discovered when they served a search
warrant at his apartment in Venice.</TE>

<HD>UC Programs in Israel Are Suspended; Students to Return</HD>
<DH>Security: University cites Mideast violence. State
Department issues warning to travelers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON and STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing escalating violence in the Middle East, the University of
California said Tuesday that it is suspending its academic program in
Israel and encouraging students still there to return home.</LD>
<LD>   University officials said they are arranging travel back to the
United States for 27 UC students who have been spending the academic
year in Israel. An additional 28 students who started the year there
have already left, a spokesman said, and the program will be formally
suspended next week.</LD>
<LD>   "The top priority has to be the safety of the students," said UC
spokesman Hanan Eisenman. "In light of the escalating situation, we
felt this was the most prudent course of action."</LD>
<TE>   With the announcement, UC joined other universities, including
USC, the University of Colorado and the University of Washington, in
placing academic programs in Israel on hold. USC took the action in
August, and several other schools did so soon after the latest round
of Israeli-Palestinian violence began more than a year ago, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The latest suspension came as the State Department warned
Americans on Tuesday against traveling to Israel, the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip and said dependents of American diplomats in Jerusalem
were being encouraged to return home.</TE>
<TE>   But other study programs in Israel are continuing, despite the
risks.</TE>
<TE>   Brandeis University, a Massachusetts school that describes itself
as the nation's only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college, has no
immediate plans to suspend operations in Israel or bring home the
seven students now studying there, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we are concerned about the students' safety, but for
many of these young men and women--especially those who are
Jewish--traveling to Israel is an important part of their young
adulthood," said university spokesman Dennis Nealon.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the situation becomes significantly worse, the university
will leave decisions to stay or go up to the students and their
families, Nealon said.</TE>
<TE>   Other study programs still operating in the country include
Birthright Israel, which gives college-age Jews a free, 10-day trip
to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Wagner, a spokesman for the program in Washington, D.C., said
Birthright Israel is going ahead with plans to take thousands of
young visitors to Israel this spring and summer. Applications for the
trips have dropped off slightly in recent months, Wagner said, and
the program is monitoring the situation in Israel closely.</TE>

<LD>A Superior Court judge cleared the way for the introduction of
fingerprint evidence in the upcoming trial of Yosemite murder suspect
Cary Stayner.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Thomas Hastings ruled that a separate hearing would not be
necessary to determine if the fingerprints were admissible when
Stayner goes to trial June 10.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors want to introduce a fingerprint taken from a stamp
they say Stayner used to mail a letter that led investigators to the
body of 15-year-old Juli Sund, who was killed along with her mother,
Carole, and family friend Silvina Pelosso, 16.</LD>

<LD>   Lawyers for the tabloid said Carolyn Condit never demanded a

<LD>   Carolyn Condit filed suit in February, accusing the tabloid of

<HD>Panel OKs Bill to Aid Shelters</HD>
<DH>Government: State Senate committee approves $4 million to
keep homes for abused women in operation through 2003.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A state Senate committee approved $4 million Tuesday to bail out
battered-women's shelters whose grants were cut off last year in a
snafu that embarrassed Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   On a unanimous vote, the Public Safety Committee sent the proposal
(SB1712) by state Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena) to the Appropriations
Committee for further scrutiny and expected passage to the full
Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The bailout is the second in two years. Last year, the Legislature
approved $2 million in emergency grants to keep the shelters in
business through June 30.</LD>
<TE>   The current bill would set aside $4 million for the 10 shelters
throughout California in 2002-03. The shelters, which receive a
combination of state and federal funds, are prohibited by U.S. rules
from applying for renewed grants any sooner than 2004.</TE>
<TE>   A controversy erupted last year when it was disclosed that
officials of the state Office of Criminal Justice Planning, which
approves the shelter funds, had denied renewing grants for a variety
of minuscule reasons, including typing mistakes on applications.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the shelters, many of whose applications had been
routinely approved in the past, were in jeopardy of shutting off
services to abused women and children. Even the application of
respected Haven House of Pasadena, which at 38 is the oldest in the
country, was rejected because it submitted too many pages of
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who apparently was unaware of the office's actions, signed
an emergency bill last summer to keep the shelters open.</TE>
<TE>   But in a rare public demonstration of temper, Davis blistered the
agency for invoking "the most trivial of technicalities" to deny the
grants.</TE>
<TE>   Davis supports spending $4 million for the shelters as a two-year
rescue package, even though he is struggling to erase the state's
$17.5-billion budget shortfall. The money would be tapped from
surplus funds in a program that pays for DNA lab work in cases
involving unsolved sexual crimes.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the Public Safety Committee appeared unenthusiastic
about Scott's bill. But the senator persisted, noting that the
shelters cannot seek grants for at least two years and that they face
the prospect of going out of business in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just such a pressing need," Scott told the committee.
"They cannot apply until 2004. We've got to face the reality of
keeping open these domestic violence shelters."</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Open County Affairs to Wider Scrutiny</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under attack for allegedly violating the law by doing business
behind closed doors, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on
Tuesday bowed to pressure and adopted a host of measures that will allow
the public far greater ability to monitor the work of elected leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Among the proposals adopted Tuesday were measures to dump the county's
own lawyer, who advised against increased public participation, from
further deliberations over public access.</LD>
<LD>   The board also voted to tape-record its private meetings in order to
safeguard against abuses. And it agreed to invite the public to meetings
of supervisorial deputies, who gather to hammer out issues of public
concern.</LD>
<TE>   "I think these changes are long overdue," Zev Yaroslavsky, the
chairman of the board, said. Yaroslavsky, who recommended many of the
proposals approved Tuesday, added: "I think it's a significant first
step."</TE>
<TE>   The board actions--all of which were taken in a unanimous single
vote--came after a two-hour hearing. More than 50 open-government
advocates, union leaders, county employees, neighborhood activists and
others criticized the supervisors' long-standing practice of meeting in
secret on matters that have public impact.</TE>
<TE>   Those moves reposition Los Angeles County, which has long been among
the state's most private governments, more into the mainstream in terms
of public access to official proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Access to those proceedings is particularly important because Los
Angeles County supervisors wield enormous influence over local affairs.
They are, in effect, the legislative and executive branches of a
government that commands a $16-billion annual budget and whose decisions
shape the region's policies on health care, homelessness, poverty,
transportation and other vital matters.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their reach, however, Los Angeles' supervisors have largely
worked out of public view. A recent analysis by The Times found that more
than 90% of the supervisors' official business was conducted without
public comment. Supervisors typically meet individually with the county
administrative officer on Mondays to discuss the board's Tuesday agenda.
In addition, the supervisors' aides also meet before the board's official
sessions to resolve policy matters.</TE>
<TE>   Both of those regular meetings were criticized Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not acceptable for you or your deputies to hold closed meetings
because reaching a consensus in private saves time," said Tom Clanin,
president of the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Society Professional
Journalists. "We cannot allow the public's right to know to be suppressed
for the sake of official convenience."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, supervisors did not acknowledge any wrongdoing or even
discuss the issue that led them to consider change: the inadvertent
disclosure of a secret vote to kill a proposed ballot initiative. That
disclosure, made to The Times last month, touched off the debate that has
consumed the supervisors for weeks and that resulted in Tuesday's vote.</TE>
<TE>   When Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke briefly alluded to that issue,
Yaroslavsky reined her in.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to rehash history," he said. "We do need to remember
that we have been sued."</TE>
<TE>   The Times sued the board last week for allegedly breaking open
meetings laws, and the district attorney is reviewing county materials to
see whether the supervisors may have violated those laws.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, political pressure has mounted as well. On Tuesday,
hundreds of county workers from three unions protested the board's
closed-door meetings outside the Hall of Administration, then streamed
into the meeting room to put their complaints on the record.</TE>
<TE>   Among the dozens of speakers were an AIDS activist made to wait 72
days and charged more than $300 for a seven-page report, probation
officers who were kicked out of a meeting where supervisors' deputies
discussed policy changes that affected their jobs, and a journalist who
was repeatedly denied access to a children's shelter and required to put
her questions to the county in writing.</TE>
<TE>   Speakers recommended their own reforms, including the passage of a
local "sunshine" ordinance, which would require quicker response to
public records requests, expand the list of public documents and limit
closed-door discussions.</TE>
<TE>   The union representing home health-care aides, whose initiative the
board had voted to scuttle, asked the board to discuss all ballot
initiatives in public and release to the public documents relating to
private discussions of proposed ballot measures, including term limits.</TE>
<TE>   None of those suggestions was immediately taken up by the board.</TE>
<TE>   One measure sought by critics of the board--a recommendation by
Yaroslavsky to open to the public meetings of supervisors'
deputies--almost did not pass Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Cautioning against a "rush to some judgment," Don Knabe and Gloria
Molina suggested that the board leave out that issue, until Yaroslavsky
insisted it be included.</TE>
<TE>   Knabe and Molina also asked their colleagues to have the remaining
recommendations reviewed by J. Kenneth Brown, who is defending the board
against accusations that it has violated the law.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the intensity of Tuesday's debate and the public interest in
it, the board resolved the items with customary dispatch. Once the public
had its say, the board's discussion and vote took 30 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Mahony Says Victims' Requests Led to Secrecy</HD>
<DH>Catholics: In interview, he defends decision not to reveal accused
priests' identities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, in his first interview since the
priest-abuse scandal broke, said Tuesday his refusal to give details
about priests dismissed from the Los Angeles Archdiocese was based on
requests from police and victims.</LD>
<LD>   The cardinal, the archbishop of Los Angeles, requested an interview
with a Times reporter to clear the air about the archdiocese's role in
the sex abuse cases. He compared the church's sexual abuse crisis to a
cancer, saying that until the "last injurious cell" is removed, the
church will not be able to move on.</LD>
<LD>   However, Mahony did little to clarify the types of abuses committed by
the six to 12 archdiocese priests sources said he removed earlier this
year. Nor would he say exactly how many priests were dismissed. He said
two victims in "heart-wrenching pleas" urged him not to reveal the
priests' identities.</LD>
<TE>   A lieutenant in the Los Angeles Police Department unit that
specializes in sexually exploited children cases said based on recent
meetings he has attended, the church was never asked not to disclose the
number of priests Mahony recently discharged.</TE>
<TE>   While refusing to say how many priests were dismissed, Mahony said
that none were currently involved in any ministry involving children or
youths. The scandal, which has sent tremors throughout the worldwide
church, erupted in January in Boston, when it was reported that a priest
who had allegedly molested more than 130 boys had been transferred by
superiors from parish to parish.</TE>
<TE>   Boston Cardinal Bernard Law has come under pressure to resign. Mahony
declined to take a stand on Law's future Tuesday, but said, "I don't know
how I could face people. I don't know how I could walk down the main
aisle of the church myself comfortably, interiorly, if I had been
[guilty] of grave neglect." He said later in an e-mail that his use of
the term "grave neglect" was not a personal judgment, but a frequently
used characterization by Catholics in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   While emphasizing that even one case of sexual abuse brought "terrible
agony and tragedy" to the victim, Mahony said problems in the
three-county Los Angeles archdiocese paled in comparison to Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal also discussed the demanding regimen of celibacy, saying
it was not connected to child abuse. Asked how he models a celibate life
for his priests, Mahony said support groups and spirituality are
essential.</TE>
<TE>   "We must have a life of prayer. We need a good spiritual director, and
I particularly promote the use of support groups, especially prayer
support groups. I've belonged to one almost my entire priesthood," Mahony
said.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal said there are only two current sex-abuse cases in the
archdiocese. One was reported last year, involving a permanent deacon.
Another, involving the abuse of youths in an Azusa church, was recently
phoned in to the archdiocese's hotline. Mahony said it has not been
determined whether that case involves a priest. Sheriff's detectives on
Monday said they were investigating but would not identify the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the paucity of new cases shows that the archdiocese's
sexual abuse policy, first put in force in 1988 and strengthened last
month, is working.</TE>
<TE>   He said current cases of priestly abuse are handled openly and that
there is no hesitancy to inform a parish when circumstances warrant. The
church, he said, fully complies with the civil law that mandates that all
suspected child abuse and neglect be reported to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Our number-one job is to protect children and young people. Our
second job is to reach out to victims in the best way we can," Mahony
said. Next, he said, parishioners and priests need support during a
crisis Mahony called "one of the most difficult things I've ever been
through."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony stressed that all of the recently dismissed priests were
involved in old cases, many of them decades old, and that they had been
through the criminal justice system. Their names, he said, had been known
to law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Two victims in the old cases, Mahony said, pleaded with him not to
release the names of the abusing priests because the records would also
show the names of the victims. In one case, a man said the disclosure
that he had been sexually abused as a boy would threaten his marriage. In
another case, a man who was abused told Mahony he had managed to avoid
answering an employment question about any history of abuse. If it came
out that he had been abused as a youth, the man told Mahony, he could
lose his job.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony acknowledged during questioning that it may appear that he is
protecting the priests and not the victims. But he said he was convinced
by the two victims who feared releasing the priests' names would "lead to
their front door."</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a very, very difficult thing for me because I really
sincerely believe what they [the victims] told me and the anguish of
their hearts. I promised them I wouldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Repeating a statement from a week ago, he said that he had no
objection if victims want to disclose the names of their priest
offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he was convinced by church attorneys that it would not be
practical to name a specific number of dismissals because there were
several reviews of old cases.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese, Mahony said, has gone so far as to ask the LAPD to
look at old cases that fell in the jurisdiction of other police
departments. Mahony said some smaller departments had, in effect, dropped
the ball years ago and that the archdiocese wanted to be sure nothing had
gone unnoticed. He declined to name the smaller departments he had in
mind.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported on March 4 that six to 12 priests had been
dismissed by Mahony in February, according to sources in the church.
Mahony at the time refused to confirm or deny the report. Later, he said
only that "a few" priests, almost all of them retired, were involved.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no Black Monday when all of a sudden a bunch of people got
dumped," Mahony said Tuesday. He said most of them were already retired.
Some were living outside the archdiocese. But he said he took action
because they receive pensions from the Los Angeles archdiocese and remain
canonically attached as priests to the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Some dismissals were delayed until February, he said, to make sure the
priests had a supportive environment. "If you just toss them out on the
street, and with great trauma, maybe that triggers acting out again,
endangers youth again," Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that most of the priests agreed that the church had to
dismiss them, although it was difficult for some of the men because they
had had a clean record since their cases were disposed of by the criminal
justice system.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony rejected suggestions by some conservatives in the church that
homosexual priests were responsible for much of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it has nothing to do with homosexuality, heterosexuality or
with celibacy," Mahony said. "It is a problem of sexual maturation on the
part of the priest. That's where the problem is. It doesn't make any
difference who it is or what line of work they're in."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Mahony said some good will come out of the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing a lot of reflection during Holy Week and preparing
for Easter," he said. "Out of all this bad and evil has come some good.
Maybe that's always true in God's plan," he said. "The controversy is a
purification that will only make the church stronger and more humble and
better."</TE>

<HD>A Brief Pause to Take Stock of the Living and the Dead</HD>
<DH>Ramallah: Israel lifts restrictions to allow residents to shop for
food and bury bodies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The bodies were stacking up in the morgue.</LD>
<LD>   During the five days of Israel's stifling siege of Ramallah, it had
been impossible to bury a body. The siege, imposed by Israel as part of
what it calls its war on terrorism, has trapped people in their homes,
kept children out of school and blocked access to basic services such as
medical care.</LD>
<LD>   But a brief respite came Tuesday afternoon when Israel lifted
restrictions and Palestinians were allowed to emerge into the daylight
for a couple of hours.</LD>
<TE>   With hesitation at first, and then something akin to frenzy, they
ventured out, cleaned off market shelves and lined up at gas stations.
And they buried their dead, most of whom had been shot by Israeli forces
who took over this city, the de facto capital of the Palestinian West
Bank, on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the morgue, on the edge of an asphalt parking lot, an
earthmover dug two pits, one for male bodies and a smaller one for the
women. Suddenly, amid cries of "Allahu akbar!" (God is great!), workers
sprinted from the morgue to the lot, carrying one body after another.</TE>
<TE>   The 17 corpses were wrapped in white plastic, some of it stained with
blood. After hasty, emotional prayers in the parking lot, the dead were
lowered into the mass graves.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials said the hasty burials were necessary because
the morgue was crowded beyond capacity, and this seemed the safest way to
lay the dead to rest, even though TV cameras and journalists appeared to
outnumber family members. But clearly, political protest was part of the
ritual.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one family would have none of the spectacle. They picked up
their corpse, loaded it in the back of their truck and drove away for
their own private funeral, even though that meant risking a violation of
the Israeli curfew.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent victim of the violence here was among the dead buried
Tuesday. Widad Sufran, a hard-of-hearing grandmother in her 50s, had gone
to the hospital in the morning to have a cast removed from her leg. That
done, she began to hobble home on her cane.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli sniper from a nearby building shot her down about 50 yards
from the hospital's entrance, according to doctors who witnessed the
shooting. The ambulance crew that tried to reach her also came under
fire, the witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "She stayed home by herself, and no one explained to her how dangerous
the situation is," said a cousin, Rasma, 50, who jostled among the crowd
at the parking lot funeral.</TE>
<TE>   When Israel reoccupied Ramallah, it poured dozens of tanks and other
armor into the city, which is nine miles north of Jerusalem. Residents
were formally ordered to remain inside their homes, but even if there
hadn't been a formal order, the sight of a hulking tank on the corner, or
the chance of accidentally running up against one, has been enough to
keep many people at home.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and
the local Palestinian Red Crescent Society voiced alarm Tuesday at the
deteriorating situation for Palestinians, especially in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Husan Sharkawai, an official with the Red Crescent Society, said that
once-prosperous Ramallah was suffering its worst conditions in more than
30 years. He said ambulances were unable to respond to hundreds of calls
from sick and wounded residents. On Tuesday alone, he said, three
ambulances were stopped by soldiers and the medics arrested.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Israeli army said the ambulances had failed to
coordinate properly with officers on the ground and had failed to
identify themselves properly. The army has charged in the past that
ambulances are often used to transport weapons and fighters. "It's a very
tense situation," the spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents reported acute shortages of food and water. Many had no
electricity or telephone service for long periods during the preceding
five days.</TE>
<TE>   At the city's downtown Manara Square, Israeli tanks and the
Palestinian gunmen who have been doing daily battle with them had pulled
back Tuesday afternoon for the brief respite.</TE>
<TE>   Aladeen Ferris sprang into action. The ginger-haired 21-year-old
farmer loaded his carts full of bananas from a storehouse and took up a
position just off the square, where the fruit sold quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Two more days and these bananas would have gone bad," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Adel Bara was among the buyers, having emerged from his home for the
first time in five days. The 40-year-old civil engineer had used his last
bread for dinner with his five children Monday night. He wasn't sure what
would happen Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we didn't have breakfast, we didn't have lunch," he said.</TE>

<HD>Drop Peace Effort, Right Urges Bush</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As President Bush struggles to define a consistent course in the
Middle East, a chorus of leading conservative voices has begun loudly
discouraging the administration from inserting itself into peace
negotiations--and instead is urging the president to give Israel a freer
hand to respond militarily to Palestinian suicide bombings.</LD>
<LD>   In a series of articles over the last two weeks, conservative thinkers
such as William Kristol and William J. Bennett--and leading right-leaning
media such as the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the National
Review--have used phrases such as "amateur hour," "moral confusion" and
"Clintonite wishful thinking" to describe the administration's recent
initiatives to breathe life into the flagging Mideast peace process.</LD>
<LD>   This criticism inverts the charge from many Democrats--echoed in the
editorial pages of many newspapers--that Bush hasn't done enough to
encourage talks between the two sides. Instead, the conservatives are
arguing that promoting talks amounts to rewarding Palestinian terrorism
and risks undercutting the "Bush doctrine" of punishing states that
nurture terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a fundamental tension between the war on terrorism and the
peace process, if the peace process means negotiating with terrorists or
tolerating terrorism," argues Kristol, publisher of the Weekly Standard,
a leading conservative magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism on the right has quieted somewhat since Bush condemned
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat last weekend and said he
could "understand" the new Israeli offensive in the West Bank. As they do
on many issues, White House aides brushed off the criticism as carping
from the margins.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a little bit of hubbub . . . but I don't read it as a big
deal," said a senior White House official.</TE>
<TE>   But the harsh conservative words for the administration's diplomatic
efforts--particularly Vice President Dick Cheney's recent trip through
the Mideast--suggest that as the bloody conflict continues, Bush will
face sustained pressure within his party to accept Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's aggressive use of force.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is anybody who puts much stock in talks right
now," said Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), a top conservative supporter of
Israel. "Many people are saying, 'How can we tell Israel to pull back
[militarily] when, if terrorists were hitting us that way, we would be
going back at them hammer and tong?' "</TE>
<TE>   Such comments underscore the shift in the GOP's center of gravity on
the Middle East just since the inauguration of Bush, whose administration
sought a more impartial stance.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very hard for Bush to be seen as pressuring Israel in the
classic way his father did," says Steven L. Spiegel, associate director
of the Burkle Center for International Relations at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the entire American debate over the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict has tilted right, especially since the collapse of the Camp
David peace negotiations under President Clinton in 2000. In Israel, the
rising level of Palestinian violence has strengthened the hands of those
who see military action as the key to confronting the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Across the American political spectrum, the differences on how to deal
with the crisis today are relatively narrow--especially when compared
with the call from the European Union on Tuesday for Israel to
immediately withdraw its troops. But important nuances still divide the
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Most leading Democrats have echoed Bush in viewing the Israeli West
Bank offensive as legitimate self-defense. But Democrats generally
believe that Bush erred by reducing American involvement in the region
last year and should be trying harder now to encourage negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Even Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), usually one of the most
hawkish Democrats, told CNN on Monday that Bush should convene an
international conference to begin negotiations between Israel and the
Arab nations over the "vision of peace" that the Arab League endorsed in
Beirut last week.</TE>
<TE>   It is precisely such an intensified diplomacy that the conservatives
are urging Bush to avoid.</TE>
<TE>Administration's Efforts Called 'Amateur Hour'</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's trip through the region last month--which was designed to
rally Arab support for action against Iraq but ended with the vice
president holding out the possibility of meeting with Arafat--drew a hail
of bricks from the right. In the Weekly Standard, Kristol and co-author
Robert Kagan compared the trip to Clinton Secretary of State Warren
Christopher's unsuccessful 1993 mission to rally European support for
intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</TE>
<TE>   "The past two weeks have been amateur hour in American diplomacy,"
they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives have also recoiled from Bush's encouragement of the Arab
League peace initiative--a proposal under which the Arab nations would
recognize Israel if the Jewish state withdrew to its pre-1967 borders and
allowed the creation of a Palestinian state. Many of the conservative
thinkers have argued that constructive peace discussions can begin only
after a much greater level of Israeli military action.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can have negotiations now. You have to fight it
out," argues Bennett, a leader among social conservatives and a secretary
of Education under Ronald Reagan. "And then once they have fought it out
. . . the United States can play a major role."</TE>
<TE>   Others say peace between Israel and the Palestinians may come only
after the U.S. shows the Arab world its own commitment to resisting
terror by toppling Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "The path to a calmer Mideast now lies not through Jerusalem but
through Baghdad," said the Wall Street Journal editorial page.</TE>
<TE>   One White House official sympathetic to the conservative critique says
Bush can never go as far as the right wants in emphasizing military over
diplomatic solutions. While criticizing Arafat and sympathizing with the
Israeli action in recent days, Bush has also said that Israel must leave
open a "pathway to peace" through negotiations and has refused to label
Arafat a terrorist. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
criticized Israel's suggestion that it might exile Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bush's instinctive support of Israel places him at the center
of a generational shift in Republican thinking about the Mideast.</TE>
<TE>   For the first decades of the Jewish state's existence, the Republican
Party was generally less supportive of Israel than Democrats, and more
concerned than Democrats about protecting America's economic and
political interests in the Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   "The classic position of the Republican Party, the Dwight Eisenhower
approach, was that we have an obligation to Israel . . . but let's face
it, our interests lie fundamentally on the Arab side, in anti-communism
and the oil question," said Spiegel.</TE>
<TE>   Republican attitudes began to shift in the 1980s under Reagan, who
identified more closely with Israel than any previous GOP president.
Reagan was heavily influenced by the so-called neoconservatives, mostly
Jewish (and formerly Democratic) intellectuals who portrayed support for
Israel as a moral commitment to a fellow democracy.</TE>
<TE>Bush's Father Had a Different Approach</TE>
<TE>   As on many issues, the attitude of Bush's father toward Israel
represented a temporary interruption in the GOP's Reaganite drift.
Harking back to the earlier Eisenhower position, the elder Bush's
administration (particularly Secretary of State James A. Baker III)
frequently clashed with the Israeli government and took positions that
Israel advocates considered pro-Arab.</TE>
<TE>   Yet around the elder Bush, Republican thinking was continuing to tilt
more toward Israel. Along with the neocons, Israel benefited through the
1980s and '90s from the rising clout inside the GOP of conservative
evangelical Christians. To a broad range of conservative Christians,
support for Israel is virtually ordained by the Bible. Last month, for
instance, Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), a staunch social conservative,
declared on the Senate floor that Israel should maintain control of the
Palestinian territories "because God said so. . . . Look it up in the
book of Genesis."</TE>
<TE>   Republican ties to Israel have also increased as the Israelis have
elected more conservative governments and as the increased lethality of
Palestinian terrorism has generally diminished sympathy in America for
the Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   These currents have moved the GOP closer to Israel even though
American Jews--often considered the most powerful force in shaping U.S.
Mideast policy--have remained solidly Democratic in their voting
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the evolution of Republican thinking is encapsulated in the
space between George W. Bush and his father.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush 41 just had a different view on this one," said the White House
official sympathetic to the conservative critique. "I just think
President Bush is closer to Reagan than his father in his instincts on
many things, and Israel is one of them. When you listen to him, his
instincts are more to be critical of Arafat than his father's were."</TE>

<HD>Easier for Him to Say</HD>
<DH>A UC Irvine professor thinks he may be onto a treatment for
stuttering. He's testing a drug for the frustrating affliction that he
shares with 3 million Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mouth disconnects from the brain. You start to speak and
nothing comes out. At the drive-thru window, you order the food you can
pronounce, not the food you want. You fret over making a presentation to
colleagues because the simple act of speaking is a struggle.</LD>
<LD>   Gerald Maguire knows the frustrations well. He is a stutterer.</LD>
<LD>   That is why the UC Irvine psychiatry professor is trying to find a
cure for the disorder, which affects 3 million Americans. When he says a
new drug shows promise, he knows what he's talking about. Not only did he
devise the experiment to test its effectiveness, he takes the pill every
evening.</LD>
<TE>   Even if he spoke without difficulty, Maguire would be unusual. Most
scientists researching the disorder are speech pathologists. Maguire is
one of a handful of physicians, and maybe the only psychiatrist, studying
the causes of stuttering.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always fascinated with how the brain works," Maguire said. "I
wanted to know how my brain works, why sometimes I was fluent and
sometimes I was disfluent."</TE>
<TE>   Maguire's work is helping transform the way stuttering is viewed and
treated. Long regarded as an educational or psychological problem,
stuttering increasingly is seen as a medical disorder rooted, at least in
part, in the chemistry of the brain.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire, 36, has been a pioneer in searching the brain for the sources
of stuttering and in using drugs to control the disorder. He performed
the first brain scans on stutterers. They showed that when levels of the
chemical dopamine were reduced through drug therapy, activity in a deep
portion of the brain increased and stuttering decreased.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Maguire is trying to identify medicine that will offer the
biggest improvement in fluency with the fewest side effects.</TE>
<TE>   His work is receiving enthusiastic notice in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting because it suggests there may be a way to
pharmaceutically manipulate what's going on," said Ben Watson, a
professor of speech physiology at New York Medical College. Maguire's
research, he said, holds out hope of significantly easing stuttering "by
changing the underlying brain chemistry."</TE>
<TE>   Maguire's stutter is barely noticeable these days, an improvement he
credits to olanzapine, an antipsychotic drug with which he is
experimenting. He gets stuck on some words--repeating the p in pilot, for
instance--and sometimes elongates words.</TE>
<TE>   But he's come a long way from the days when he struggled to say his
name and avoided the telephone. As a psychiatric resident at UC Irvine
Medical Center in Orange, Maguire would run to the nurse's station when
he was paged rather than respond by phone.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought this resident was so attentive," he said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   For most of his life, every time Maguire opened his mouth, he worried
what would come out.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 1% of Americans who stutter suffer the same fears. Their
fractured speech often is attributed to stupidity or nervousness. Not
only do they struggle to speak, but the accompanying tics, grimaces and
contortions offer ammunition for tormentors and add to the discomfort of
friends and acquaintances.</TE>
<TE>   "My experience has been that people are not deliberately rude to
people who stutter," said Granville Kirkup, an Irvine entrepreneur who
has participated in Maguire's drug experiments. "They just don't
understand it, and that makes them uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Kirkup, an executive vice president and founder of Telmar Network
Technology, a provider of telecommunications equipment and services, has
donated $250,000 to UC Irvine for Maguire's research. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.,
the maker of olanzapine, has contributed $60,000.</TE>
<TE>   At 36, married and the father of a 2-year-old daughter, Maguire still
gets teased. He'll stumble while ordering a cheeseburger, and the
waitress may mimic him. Or he'll trip over "Maguire." "Oh, you forgot
your name?" he'll be asked.</TE>
<TE>   He shrugs off the slights. "Sometimes I tell them, 'No, I stutter.' I
try to educate them. I don't want the next person to go through it."</TE>
<TE>   Science has long struggled to identify the cause of stuttering.
Through the years, some researchers thought it was behavior learned from
parents, siblings or playmates. Others thought the cause was
psychological, stemming from an abnormally close relationship between
mother and child. Still others said stuttering stemmed from anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   The American Psychiatric Assn. classifies stuttering as a psychiatric
problem, which puts it in the same category as bipolar disorder and
severe depression. Maguire once read that it was caused by "unresolved
pregenital oral sadistic conflicts."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a board-certified psychiatrist, and I don't know what that
means," he said.</TE>
<TE>   These days, however, researchers theorize that stuttering springs from
multiple causes, ranging from brain chemistry to heredity to
environmental factors.</TE>
<TE>   People nearly always begin stuttering between the ages of 2 and 4.
About 60% of children outgrow it by puberty, suggesting an association
with brain development.</TE>
<TE>   The disorder affects four times as many males as females. Studies show
that identical twins both stutter in 63% of cases, whereas among
fraternal twins, both children stutter only 19% of the time--an
indication that heredity plays a role. Stuttering appears to be passed
more often through the mother.</TE>
<TE>   Actor James Earl Jones, singers Mel Tillis and Carly Simon, and
basketball star turned broadcaster Bill Walton have battled the disorder.
Former Raiders defensive back Lester Hayes stuttered so badly during a
nationally televised interview after the 1983 Super Bowl that he was
incomprehensible.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars say a biblical quotation attributed to Moses: ". . . I am
slow of speech and of a slow tongue," suggests he too was afflicted.</TE>
<TE>   One mystery of stuttering is that it disappears when a person affects
an accent, sings or otherwise changes his voice. It sometimes ceases when
a person reads aloud with others. Maguire believes that in these
circumstances, the speaker somehow bypasses the brain mechanism that
causes stuttering.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire seems not the least bit self-conscious about his stuttering.
If he were, he said, he would have taken up a specialty like radiology,
where talking with patients would be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe unconsciously I was hopeful that stuttering would be more
accepted in psychiatry than other fields," he said. "I know in psychiatry
you have a longer-term relationship [with patients]. Most first
impressions with stutterers are not good."</TE>
<TE>   Stuttering may even help him develop rapport with his patients,
Maguire said. He recalled one who told him: "I think you'll understand
me. I've struggled with depression my whole life, and I think you've
struggled with something your whole life."</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't say stutter," Maguire said. "But I knew what she meant."</TE>
<TE>   Maguire grew up near the Northern California town of Chico, the
youngest of four boys and a girl born to a registered nurse and a
psychiatrist for the Butte County Mental Health Department.</TE>
<TE>   At age 8, Maguire tried speech therapy and biofeedback, a technique
that seeks to enhance a person's control over automatic body functions.
The idea was that biofeedback could help relieve anxiety, which was seen
as a major factor in stuttering.</TE>
<TE>   A brainy child who was driven to succeed, Maguire would look up words
he had difficulty pronouncing to find synonyms he could say more easily.
The speech therapist thought he was improving; his vocabulary grew.</TE>
<TE>   Outwardly, he didn't seem to be suffering, but in private he wondered
why he suffered such an affliction.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine out of 100 people who stutter say that," Maguire said.</TE>
<TE>   To deflect attention from his speech disorder, Maguire became the
class comedian, cracking up classmates with imitations of Donald Duck,
W.C. Fields, Elmer Fudd and a famous stutterer, Jimmy Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   In high school, Maguire acted as if his stutter didn't exist. After
tryouts, the faculty voted him commencement speaker, and students elected
him their representative to the school board. As a junior, he won a
debate competition, stuttering all the way.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire honed his sense of humor as an undergraduate at UC Davis. In
the deadly serious world of biochemistry majors, he stood out, friends
recall.</TE>
<TE>   In one class, groups of students analyzed a journal article to
determine if the author really had discovered a new protein. One by one,
the groups presented their conclusions before the class, each more boring
than the one before. Maguire's group performed a "People's Court" spoof
called "The Protein Court."</TE>
<TE>   In medical school at St. Louis University, Maguire considered becoming
a pediatrician. "Little kids, they don't care if you stutter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   An experience in his second year helped lead him to psychiatry. Once a
week for a month, he followed a pediatrician on his rounds. The
pediatrician seemed to view his patients as a collection of ailing
organs, not as people. By contrast, a psychiatrist that Maguire followed
knew his patients by name, and without looking at their charts could
delve into detail about their problems.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire became interested in the science of stuttering during his
second year of residency at UC Irvine, while looking for a research
project. His psychiatrist father read an article about the medications
that had been tried to treat the disorder. The article said doctors had
some success with haloperidol, a powerful antipsychotic drug, but that
the side effects were too severe to permit its use for stuttering.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him that no one in field seems to know anything," said his
father, also named Gerald Maguire. "It seems there's something here. It
seems to be a natural since you've got the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Maguire's first experiments tested blood-pressure medications, because
some doctors had reported that as a side effect, patients who stuttered
became more fluent. Maguire's study did not find proof that the
medication worked.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire teamed up for the study with Glyndon Riley, a professor of
communications disorders at Cal State Fullerton and one of the most
respected stuttering researchers in the country. The speech and language
pathologist developed the Riley Stuttering Severity Instrument, in which
subjects are videotaped and the percentage of syllables stuttered, and
the duration of each stuttering event, are measured.</TE>
<TE>   Riley became a mentor to Maguire. As Maguire continued his research,
Riley scored the subjects' stuttering. "I was no longer an outsider in
the world of stuttering, but an insider because of Glyn," Maguire said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Maguire put patients under an instrument that allows
researchers to see what portions of the brain are used during a specific
activity. Their research found that the left caudate, located deep in the
brain, was not nearly as active in stutterers as in those with normal
speech. It was the first time anyone had pinpointed a part of the brain
that might be responsible for stuttering.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire's theory is that stuttering is associated with an overload of
dopamine in the brain. Drugs such as haloperidol weaken dopamine's
effect. Dopamine, produced in a portion of the brain called the
substantia nigra, helps regulate speech, muscle motion, reasoning,
behavior and emotion. Patients with Parkinson's disease are deficient in
dopamine. The chemical is found throughout the brain, but the left
caudate usually is especially rich in dopamine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Maguire experimented with a new antipsychotic drug,
risperidone, that seemed to cause fewer side effects. Caudate activity
jumped in subjects put through the PET scanner, while incidents of
stuttering dropped. "That was very exciting," said Maguire, who took the
drug himself.</TE>
<TE>   But many patients complained of lowered libido and depression.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire was running up against a problem that had bedeviled
researchers a couple of decades earlier. Like him, they thought there was
a dopamine connection. But the drugs they tried were so powerful that the
research fell out of favor.</TE>
<TE>   When the antipsychotic drug olanzapine was introduced in 1997, Maguire
again became his own first guinea pig. The results were promising, so he
launched a clinical trial in which he was strictly a researcher and not a
subject.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-three people took part in the three-month experiment. Twelve
received olanzapine in doses one-10th to one-third those used for
antipsychotic treatment; 11 received placebos. Using Riley's scale,
Maguire found that olanzapine lowered incidents of stuttering by 40%,
compared to 15% for the patients on the placebo. The only side effects
were a slight weight gain and drowsiness.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire and Riley presented their research at conferences of the
American College of Neuropsychopharmacology and the American Speech and
Hearing Assn. last year. They also have submitted it to the Journal of
Clinical Psychiatry, where it is undergoing peer review.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire receives two to three e-mails a day from stutterers inquiring
about his research, from as far away as Pakistan and Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire can tell them how the drug has helped him. When he had the
flu, he didn't take olanzapine for two days and noticed how much more he
stuttered. When he plans to speak before a large group, he'll double the
dose.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew Jerry before he started any type of medication," said David
Franklin, research manager for UC Irvine's psychiatry program and a
co-investigator on Maguire's studies. "It changed him quite a bit. He
feels more free in speaking in public auditoriums. Now it seems those
stressful times don't affect his speech as much."</TE>
<TE>   Maguire doesn't think drugs alone are the answer to stuttering. He
envisions a combination of medicine, speech therapy and psychological
counseling.</TE>
<TE>   His patients look at Maguire's own success with drugs, and it gives
them hope. There is more work to be done to determine whether there is a
genetic, viral or bacterial link to stuttering.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire is hopeful when he considers his own work and the discovery of
a connection between stuttering and dopamine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the total story because people don't get 100% better," he
said. "But this may be the beginning."</TE>

<DH>Mideast: Stream of 250 men and women leaves ruins of Palestinian
compound run by a security chief with ties to the CIA. Sharon threatens
to exile Arafat.</DH>

<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Laying waste to one of the last remaining symbols of Palestinian
autonomy, Israel bombarded the West Bank's central security headquarters
Tuesday and then--through direct U.S. mediation--agreed to a mass
surrender by the enemy.</LD>
<LD>   As his army expanded a 5-day-old offensive in the West Bank, Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon threatened to send besieged Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat into exile with a "one-way ticket."</LD>
<LD>   The offensive reached one of Christianity's holiest shrines as Israeli
soldiers rolled into Bethlehem in tanks and surrounded Manger Square,
meeting daylong resistance and prompting some Palestinian gunmen to take
sanctuary in the adjacent Church of the Nativity on the site revered as
Jesus' birthplace.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. diplomats, in marathon negotiations, secured a break in the
Israeli army's destruction of the sprawling Preventive Security Service
complex commanded by Col. Jibril Rajoub after a relentless, eight-hour
air and ground assault left it a shambles.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 250 men and women, exhausted and shaken, emerged from the
ruins Tuesday afternoon. The women were freed, but the men were taken off
in buses to a nearby military base for questioning, according to people
involved. Unlike in some other surrenders during Israel's massive
military campaign across the West Bank, no one was reported killed.</TE>
<TE>   At least 13 Palestinians died Tuesday across the West Bank. Seven were
killed in Bethlehem in the day's heaviest fighting. There and in
Ramallah, Kalkilya and Tulkarm, Israelis have since Friday detained about
700 Palestinian men suspected of being terrorists. Early today, Israeli
tanks occupied two more West Bank Palestinian localities, the city of
Jenin and the village of Salfit.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian man blew himself up Tuesday evening when security forces
stopped him at a checkpoint in the West Bank village of Baqa al
Sharqiya--the seventh suicide bombing in as many days.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israel continued scouring Arafat's captured West Bank
compound in Ramallah for documents linking his Palestinian Authority to
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   One such document, a copy of which was distributed by Israeli
officials Tuesday, was a letter to the Palestinian Authority's top
financial officer, Fuad Shubaki, outlining expenses incurred by the Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigades for bomb-making materials, other weapons and
memorial ceremonies for its suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   The letter from the militant group, dated Sept. 16, says its cells
need "about 5 to 9 bombs a week." The estimated $4,500 monthly cost of
the needed electrical components and chemicals, the letter adds, "is our
largest expense."</TE>
<TE>   Israel offered no evidence that the money was given.</TE>
<TE>   Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian Cabinet member and peace negotiator, said
he knew nothing about the letter but did not believe it was authentic.
"The Israelis are very busy fabricating things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli leaders say their offensive, Operation Protective Wall, is
targeting a Palestinian terrorist infrastructure they blame for the
recent wave of suicide blasts, which has killed more than 40 Israelis.
The last week of combat has been the heaviest since the start of an armed
Palestinian uprising in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub, the most powerful security chief in the West Bank, has close
ties to American officials and the CIA and has stayed largely out of the
18-month-old conflict. He also has been widely seen as a successor to the
beleaguered Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday, U.S. diplomats had not intervened to slow Israel's
escalating assault on the Palestinian territories. They chose to do so
for a favored son, Rajoub.</TE>
<TE>   Israel declared that Rajoub was hiding suspected terrorists in his
headquarters, an opulent complex built by the CIA in Beitunia, just west
of Ramallah. Since Friday, diplomats had been attempting to persuade
Israel to refrain from attacking the compound. But Israel insisted that
the senior militants had to be removed.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations dragged on. The Palestinians were especially anxious
that any surrender be dignified. When Palestinian police have given up in
Ramallah, they have been forced to strip and submit to blindfolds or
handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   As the negotiations continued late Monday, Israel opted to go ahead
and launch its assault. Helicopter gunships and tanks pounded the
headquarters for hours, setting buildings afire and punching holes in the
red-tiled roofs.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Rajoub's status, Israeli officials were reported to be
divided over how far the attack should reach.</TE>
<TE>   "If you destroy the only effective security agency in the West Bank
and make sure that you have no partner in the future, then what do you
have?" asked one diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub is seen as a protege of the CIA, favored by Americans and many
Israelis. That status does not serve him well at home, however. He is
generally reviled among Palestinians, who see him as a traitor.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub, who was not inside the compound when Tuesday's assault began,
said later that about 30 members of radical Islamic groups were in his
prison. But he had to free them when Israel's army arrived, he said, and
they were fighting alongside the other men caught in the security
compound.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli radio insisted late Tuesday that dozens of militants
remained inside the compound. The Islamic militant Hamas group said seven
prisoners--six of its own men and one member of the Islamic Jihad
group--had not been heard from. In a harshly worded statement, Hamas said
it was holding Rajoub responsible for their safety.</TE>
<TE>   A cold rain fell on much of the West Bank on Tuesday, adding gloom to
hardships inflicted by the fighting. In Ramallah, Palestinians buried 17
of their dead in a hospital parking lot because their families had been
unable to claim the bodies until Tuesday, which were decomposing in a
hospital morgue because of power outages.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli offensive also provoked new international opposition
Tuesday, especially after fighting reached the Church of the Nativity and
other Christian churches in Bethlehem where militants sought refuge. In
an appeal to President Bush, leaders of Christian denominations in the
region asked him to restrain the Israelis and help "stop this inhuman
tragedy immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Spain, in the name of the European Union, demanded that Israel
withdraw from Palestinian cities, in line with a U.N. Security Council
resolution adopted Saturday, and restore Arafat's freedom of movement.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the military offensive
would last three to four weeks, the first estimated time frame offered by
a senior official.</TE>
<TE>   Since the offensive began, Israeli troops have kept Arafat confined to
his Ramallah compound, now ringed by barbed wire. While Israeli officials
insist that their intention is to "isolate" Arafat, rather than arrest or
harm him, Sharon raised the possibility Tuesday of banishing him into
exile.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister told reporters that he had advised European Union
envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos that European diplomats could "fly with a
helicopter and . . . take [Arafat] from here" but that "it would have to
be a one-way ticket."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's expulsion was, in fact, considered last week by Israel's
Cabinet, but Sharon backed away from the idea to avoid a conflict with
his Labor Party coalition partners, according to Israeli media accounts.
The Cabinet decided to confine Arafat to a few rooms at his headquarters
but left open the option of ousting him later.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Arafat has insisted he won't go, and foreign leaders
voiced renewed opposition to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Sending him into exile will just give him another place from which to
conduct the same kinds of activities and give the same messages as he is
giving now," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said. Powell advised
Sharon to "take care" in his offensive because Arafat has an important
role to play in the search for peace.</TE>
<TE>   Having declared Arafat an "enemy" of an Israel now "at war," Israeli
officials say they cannot envision turning to him as a peacemaker.</TE>
<TE>   "We clearly have a problem," Dore Gold, Sharon's foreign policy
advisor, told reporters Sunday. "Israel has no interest in dismantling
the Palestinian Authority. Israel has no interest in ruling the
Palestinian territories. But we need to isolate those elements of the
Palestinian Authority that are involved in terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat's role is clear. We say he's the enemy and he should be
isolated," Gold added. "Where do we go from here? We'll see once our
military operations are finished."</TE>

<HD>Latino Job Seekers Find 'Born in USA' Not Enough</HD>
<DH>Employment: Despite better education and language skills, younger
workers fall behind older immigrants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Youthful dot-com millionaires personified the nation's economic
boom. But the face of the recent slowdown looks a lot like Angel Casas.</LD>
<LD>   Laid off from his construction job earlier this year, the Echo Park
teenager still is looking for steady work. He and his unemployed
girlfriend have delayed plans to marry and get a place of their own. The
high school graduates have unpaid credit card bills, a $700 monthly truck
payment and $30 jumbo boxes of Pampers to buy for their infant son, Angel
Isaiah.</LD>
<LD>   But the toughest thing, Casas said, is remaining dependent on his
Mexican immigrant parents, who are working three blue-collar jobs between
them despite little formal schooling. In a recessionary reversal of the
American dream, many young Latinos born in the U.S. are struggling with
higher unemployment than Latino immigrants, despite the advantages of
generally better education and language skills.</LD>
<TE>   "It's frustrating sitting at home while they're working so hard," said
Casas, 18.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Silvia, said in Spanish: "How is it possible that my son
has a diploma and no job?"</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. recession may be shaping up to be one of the mildest on
record, but it has been brutal for the youngest workers. Recent
university research shows that those younger than 25 have borne the brunt
of the employment decline, accounting for more than half the total job
losses among U.S. adults in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout can be seen in the drop-off of blue-chip company
recruiters on college campuses and in the pink slips doled out to Silicon
Valley twentysomethings. But the downturn has been particularly
challenging for non-college-bound minorities such as Casas, who
increasingly are competing with older immigrants for entry-level
positions.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent data compiled by the Washington-based Pew Hispanic
Center show the U.S. jobless rate for second-generation Latinos--the
U.S-born, U.S.-educated offspring of at least one immigrant parent--at
9.4%, compared with 8.7% for first-generation immigrant Latinos. In
February, the overall U.S. unemployment rate was 5.5%.</TE>
<TE>   With many economists predicting muted job growth in the developing
recovery, employment rates for young adults, typically the last hired and
first fired, aren't expected to rebound soon.</TE>
<TE>Young Latinos Future of the Labor Force</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the long-term economic stakes are even higher for
metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, where young Latinos represent the
future of the labor force. Facing stiff competition at the low end of the
job market, many lack the higher education and skills to leapfrog into
the middle class.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got this huge labor pool that doesn't have the training and
education to go where the good jobs are," said Robert Sainz, executive
director of the Los Angeles Youth Opportunity Movement, which is working
to boost youth employment rates in low-income neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Workers with less experience and seniority typically get squeezed when
the job market gets tight. But researchers say the pinch has been more
painful this time around.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in employment among those ages 16 to 24 in 2001 totaled
nearly 1.1 million workers, or 52% of the more than 2 million U.S. jobs
lost last year, said Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market
Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. The drop was much sharper
than in previous recessions, with eight years of employment gains for
younger workers wiped out in just 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the unemployment rate for workers 16 to 24 climbed to
11.1% in February, compared with 4.7% for workers 25 to 64.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been more like a depression than a recession for workers
under age 25," Sum said.</TE>
<TE>   He said several factors are fueling the rise. For starters, there are
more young adults entering the labor force, unlike during the early-1990s
recession, when their numbers were dwindling. Young workers were heavily
represented in hard-hit sectors such as temporary staffing. And there is
evidence that companies starved for experienced employees during the good
times now are holding on to more of that gray hair.</TE>
<TE>   That has been an unwelcome surprise for job hunters such as Carlos
Virgen, 21, of Lincoln Heights, who figured his greatest asset is his
willingness to work cheap. Laid off from his minimum-wage retail jobs
after the holidays, Virgen expected to find new work immediately. But he
said the stores and warehouses where he has inquired are swamped with
seasoned applicants.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them are pretty old, like around 40," Virgen said. "I think
employers like them better because they have more experience."</TE>
<TE>   Andre Bonyadie, a Los Angeles franchisee for Quizno's Subs, said he
recently received 200 applications for 40 positions at a new downtown
location. He believes in giving young people a shot, he said, but finds
that many are woefully unprepared for the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   "They call at quarter past 4 to tell me they'll be late for a 4
o'clock shift," he said. "A lot of them can't add or subtract--even the
high school graduates."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say immigration also is playing a role in youth unemployment.
Paul Harrington, another Northeastern University researcher who has
studied the Los Angeles economy, said the huge influx of low-skilled
immigrant labor into Southern California has created heated competition
here for entry-level employment.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got this tremendous overcrowding at the bottom of the labor
market," Harrington said. "That's one of the reasons your kids are having
a tougher time getting jobs."</TE>
<TE>Many Lack Skills to Climb Higher</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by heavy immigration from rural Mexico, the Los Angeles region
is home to more minimally educated adults than any other U.S.
metropolitan area, with 1 in 10 having six or fewer years of schooling,
the nonpartisan Employment Policy Foundation reports.</TE>
<TE>   Although these immigrants may lack education, they have proved
extremely resourceful at securing work. The most recent data compiled by
the Pew Hispanic Center show the U.S. jobless rate for first-generation
Latino men at 7.9%, compared with 9.5% for their U.S.-educated,
second-generation counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Experience explains some of the gap. Young workers of all races
typically post higher unemployment rates than older workers in good
economic times and bad. The average age of the nation's 10 million
second-generation Latinos is just 19, compared with 37 for
first-generation Latino immigrants, the Pew analysis found.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants who can't find jobs often create their own in the informal
economy. Likewise, newcomers are willing to take jobs that U.S.-born
workers don't want, and they are much more wired into ethnic job
networks, said Min Zhou, a UCLA sociology professor who has studied the
phenomenon in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But though Latinos born and educated in the U.S. may have loftier
aspirations than their immigrant parents, many lack the skills to climb
higher on the economic ladder.</TE>
<TE>   Only 8% of California Latinos have a bachelor's degree or more,
compared with 33% of non-Latinos, according to a study by the nonpartisan
California Research Bureau, a division of the California State Library.
Most troubling, the study's authors concluded, is that this education gap
has proved stubborn, persisting into the second and even third
generations.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Perez, an unemployed 18-year-old from Boyle Heights, said he
regrets not finishing high school. He has seen how hard his Mexican
immigrant father labors in a factory, and he has no intention of
following him there. That's why he is working on getting his diploma and
learning construction skills at a neighborhood training center.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom keeps telling me I've got to complete [my course work] so I
can get somewhere in life," Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say raising the skill level of Perez and tens of thousands of
young workers like him is crucial to the future of California's economy.
Latinos currently are the second-largest group in the state's labor force
and will become the largest by 2025.</TE>
<TE>Working to Close the Gap</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that nearly two-thirds of lifetime wage growth
occurs in the first decade of a worker's career. Thus, early bouts of
unemployment can retard future earnings. Like moving objects in Isaac
Newton's first law, people employed early in their lives tend to stay
that way. Sum has found that states that do a good job of putting
teenagers to work even part time or in the summer are likely to see more
of them gainfully employed down the road.</TE>
<TE>   California, whose February unemployment rate was 6.1%, ranks among the
worst in the country for employing teenagers, according to Sum's
research.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, only 37% of California teens 16 to 19 were
employed; that was eighth-lowest in the country, compared with 52%
nationally. Los Angeles County ranked third-lowest of any metro area with
only 29% of 16- to 19-year-olds employed. In February, Los Angeles County
posted an overall unemployment rate of 6.4%, the highest in the
five-county region.</TE>
<TE>   Working to close the gap are groups such as the Los Angeles Youth
Opportunity Movement, known as YO, which is part of a federally funded
program begun in 2000 to boost the employability of high-risk youth. The
task is daunting, said Jimmy Valenzuela, project coordinator for the
local group, which targets Boyle Heights and Watts.</TE>
<TE>   He said the typical client is a 17-year-old dropout from a low-income,
single-parent home who reads at a fifth-grade level. Unlike many
middle-class youths seeking employment to pad their college applications

<HD>Nations Vow to Hunt Terrorists Together</HD>
<DH>Asia: Pakistani and Afghan leaders say they'll overcome past
differences between their countries to round up Taliban and Al Qaeda
fighters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, making his first visit ever
to this country, promised Tuesday to work with his "Afghan brothers" to
weed out terrorists on both sides of the rugged, mountainous border
between the two Muslim nations.</LD>
<LD>   With interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai by his side, Musharraf
also sought to minimize Pakistan's wholehearted support for the Taliban
regime before Sept. 11, saying the two countries now had a common goal of
finishing off any remaining Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders and fighters.</LD>
<LD>   Guarded by heavily armed security details from Pakistan, Afghanistan
and the U.S., Musharraf said American troops were not needed to pursue
terrorists into his nation because thousands of Pakistani soldiers were
providing the necessary manpower and intelligence.</LD>
<TE>   The president's comments came during an hourlong news conference at
which both he and Karzai said they had no idea whether Osama bin Laden
was alive.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was dead," Musharraf said, referring to comments he made
in January, when he said he believed that Bin Laden had died of kidney
failure. "Now I can't be sure.</TE>
<TE>   "He may be dead or alive, I don't know," he added. "But if you ask my
view, maybe he's dead."</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said, "I really don't know where Bin Laden is."</TE>
<TE>   The sight of the two leaders sitting together, joking and chatting
inside the presidential palace here in the capital, provoked a mixed
reaction among Afghans. Many are deeply suspicious of Pakistan, despite
its support for moujahedeen fighters during Afghanistan's 10-year war
against Soviet occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Until Musharraf abruptly shifted course under U.S. pressure after
Sept. 11, Pakistan's military and intelligence networks had worked
closely with Afghanistan's fundamentalist Taliban regime. Pakistan also
backed Taliban forces fighting the Northern Alliance, whose leaders now
dominate the interim government's military and security ministries. And
after the U.S. military campaign began Oct. 7, thousands of Pakistanis
poured into Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes there are differences between brothers," Musharraf said as
Karzai nodded. "I have no reason to believe we can't overcome these
differences."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf dismissed his support of the Taliban as "a short part of the
history . . . of excellent brotherly relations between Pakistan and
Afghanistan." He said he and Karzai had agreed not to focus on "the
bitter memory of recent years."</TE>
<TE>   According to Karzai, Afghan Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim
Fahim--who as a Northern Alliance commander fought Taliban forces backed
by Musharraf--made a point of warmly greeting Musharraf on Tuesday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me a brother, and I called him a brother, and I said I mean
every word of it," Musharraf said, beaming.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf and Karzai said that in their second announced meeting since
Karzai took office in December, they had discussed ways to cooperate in
hunting down Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters on both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   American commanders have said they expect to engage more pockets of
resistance in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan as warmer weather
allows greater movement of men and weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf pointed to raids in Pakistani cities last week that resulted
in the arrests of scores of suspected terrorists who had fled
Afghanistan, including an Arab who U.S. officials have confirmed is Abu
Zubeida, a top Al Qaeda strategist and recruiter. Pakistani officials
announced Tuesday that 16 Arabs, Afghans and Pakistanis were arrested
Monday night in follow-up raids on suspected Al Qaeda hide-outs in the
northeastern city of Lahore.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf said the arrests showed that U.S. ground troops did not need
to pursue Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters into Pakistan, though he added
that the United States had not requested permission for such pursuit by
its troops.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani forces "are very capable of taking action against intruders
in our country," he said. "The United States is feeling very comfortable
operating with us. There is excellent communication between the U.S.
forces and Pakistani forces at the strategic level and the tactical
level."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about news reports that factions within Inter-Services
Intelligence, Pakistan's intelligence agency, continued to support the
Taliban and Al Qaeda, Musharraf said he had given his "personal
guarantee" to Karzai that Pakistan fully supports the interim government.</TE>
<TE>   "The ISI is doing or not doing whatever I tell them or don't tell them
to do," Musharraf said. "They are behaving exactly as we want them to."</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said Afghanistan would "look into" releasing an unspecified
number of young Pakistani men captured as the Taliban was routed by U.S.
and coalition forces. He said those who would be released are "boys,
young men who have no relation to Al Qaeda or terrorism, who are simple
folks."</TE>
<TE>   The two leaders ended their joint appearance with Karzai's acceptance
of a $10-million check from Musharraf to help rebuild Afghanistan and,
the president told the interim prime minister, "to show solidarity with
my brother here."</TE>

<HD>Ruling Is Tearing Families Asunder</HD>
<DH>China: Children and others born on the mainland must leave Hong
Kong under a deportation order. Many are refusing to go.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>As the elderly woman told her tale, tears rolled down her cheeks
and spilled onto the patterns of her wrinkled silk blouse.</LD>
<LD>   Through the hurt, 72-year-old Tse Kam-ying explained how her only son
had departed for mainland China two days earlier under a deportation
order, leaving her bewildered and alone except for one gnawing fear: that
she will die at home and no one will know.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no one now," she stammered. "I don't know how the government
can be so cruel."</LD>
<TE>   Tse's story is among the many personal tragedies in one of Asia's most
heart-wrenching immigration battles: the fight of thousands of children
born in mainland China to live with their parents and siblings who are
legal residents of Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   Honor student Kao Lai-sha's plight of being pulled away from her
mother, father and three sisters is one of several cases that have drawn
local media attention in recent days. According to one report, 49
teachers and her school's headmaster signed a letter pleading that the
18-year-old be granted residency in Hong Kong on humanitarian grounds.</TE>
<TE>   As in the other instances, both Tse's son and Kao were ordered to
leave Hong Kong because of a Jan. 10 court ruling upholding the principle
that those born in mainland China before their parents became residents
of the territory had no right to residency.</TE>
<TE>   As a special administrative region of China since 1997, Hong Kong is
especially attractive because residents enjoy many of the rights of a
democratic society in addition to a far more affluent lifestyle than that
available to most people in the Communist-ruled mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure to restrict immigration, the Hong Kong government has
offered no leeway now that the time has come to enforce the ruling. The
judgment means that about 5,000 sons and daughters of Hong Kong residents
must go back to the mainland. More than 2,000 other people believed to be
affected by the ruling also must depart.</TE>
<TE>   The government has pledged to act firmly to expel rejected residency
applicants--known as "abode seekers"--who have ignored the official March
31 deadline for departure.</TE>
<TE>   "The government will take restrained but firm action to remove
claimants in batches in an orderly fashion," Hong Kong's deputy secretary
for security, Michael Wong, told reporters Monday, the day after the
deadline passed.</TE>
<TE>   No one in the first two batches of about 80 individuals apiece called
for deportation Monday and Tuesday by the region's Department of
Immigration showed up. On Tuesday, one of the organizers of the fight
against the deportation order, a Roman Catholic priest named Franco
Mella, advised those named in the first batches not to participate in
protest actions but to remain at home.</TE>
<TE>   Those refusing to leave face fines and possible jail terms once they
are deported, according to reports from the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a series of legal setbacks in a battle that has lasted nearly
five years, Mella believes that time and justice are on his side.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a basic and sacred human right for families to be allowed to
live together," he said in an interview Tuesday. "That means that
eventually we will win."</TE>
<TE>   Mella claims that the government exaggerated the number of mainland
children who, like Tse's son, returned ahead of the deadline to avoid
punitive measures. He says the majority of those threatened with
expulsion have remained.</TE>
<TE>   "That's very encouraging," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the priest led a march to Hong Kong's highest court and
also requested a meeting with officials at the Security Bureau to explore
possible concessions.</TE>
<TE>   "We still believe there are those in both [the Hong Kong and Beijing]
governments who want a softer line on this," Mella said. "We are not
giving up."</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong government officials claim that they are not anti-family but
are simply bound by legal rulings. Spokesman Stephen Lam noted that the
government permits controlled immigration of more than 54,000 people into
Hong Kong from the mainland each year.</TE>
<TE>   Lam said that under this program, an agreement had been reached with
Beijing that anyone under 18 who is deported would be processed for
permanent residency within a year. But he and other officials
acknowledged that the wait for others, such as Tse's son, would be far
longer--possibly as long as a decade.</TE>

<HD>Russians Among Al Qaeda Suspects</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: But the three detainees in Cuba are not from Chechnya,
under- cutting the Kremlin's effort to link the rebellion with Bin Laden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Among the 300 or so Al Qaeda suspects being detained at the
Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, Russia has identified three as Russian
citizens from Muslim minorities, officials here said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   At first blush, the announcement bolstered the Kremlin's argument that
guerrillas fighting in its separatist republic of Chechnya are part of a
worldwide terrorist network with its core in Afghanistan and its
tentacles reaching into countries around the world, including Russia.</LD>
<LD>   But officials refrained Tuesday from crowing about the Guantanamo
report. Perhaps it was because, on closer inspection, the facts fit less
well with their rhetoric.</LD>
<TE>   First, the three Russian citizens in Guantanamo are not Chechens--two
are ethnic Tatars from central Russia, and the third is an ethnic Balkar,
a member of a Muslim minority from the Caucasus that is distinct from the
Chechens. Moreover, at least so far, the three Guantanamo detainees have
not been linked to major crimes; the Russians have requested their
extradition on charges of illegal border crossing and serving as
mercenaries.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally, their case will be carefully investigated," Sergei B.
Prokopov, spokesman for the North Caucasus prosecutor general's office,
said by telephone from his office in Yessentuki. "Crossing the border
illegally and being a mercenary is just the beginning of a long and
painstaking process of finding out what these people have done and
establishing whether they have had a hand in some other criminal
offenses."</TE>
<TE>   Some ethnic Chechens undoubtedly did fight with Al Qaeda in
Afghanistan. And Western officials have cited intelligence reports that
Osama bin Laden sent money and military trainers to help Chechen
fighters.</TE>
<TE>   But since the war in Afghanistan began, little concrete evidence of an
Afghan-Chechen link has surfaced. Journalists who have gone looking for
Chechens in Afghan detention centers have so far come up empty-handed.
The few Muslims they have found who hail from Russia have appeared to be
not hardened fighters but individuals whose personal and spiritual
journeys took them to Afghanistan--much like American Talib John Walker
Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Russia's three Guantanamo prisoners had turned out to be
Chechen, they would have constituted just 1% of the Al Qaeda suspects,
observers note. There are five Britons.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that of the 300 people currently kept in Guantanamo only
three may possibly be connected to the Chechen conflict--and even these
three are not ethnic Chechens--destroys the myth that linked the conflict
in Chechnya to the operation in Afghanistan," said Stanislav
Dmitriyevsky, co-chairman of the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society, a
human rights group based in the city of Nizhny Novgorod.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's first war against Chechen separatists in 1994-96 was a
humiliating disaster that left the republic with de facto independence.
When Moscow launched its second war in September 1999, the Kremlin
changed the rhetoric completely. Four bombs had gone off in Russian
cities, killing about 300 people, so Russia was no longer fighting
"separatists," it was fighting "terrorists and bandits." Whatever
nationalist aims or historical grievances Chechens may have were
submerged in the new rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 fueled the use of such language. During a news
conference in Paris in January, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin
turned combative when asked about Russian tactics in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "The notorious Al Qaeda terrorist organization is functioning in
Afghanistan, and the Taliban criminal regime used to back it up. Everyone
agreed to fight against them," Putin said. "The same Al Qaeda is
functioning in Chechnya under the protection of another criminal
regime"--that of former Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have supported the Russian position. Following
Operation Anaconda in eastern Afghanistan, U.S. commanders, including
Maj. Gen. Frank L. Hagenbeck, noted that the fiercest Al Qaeda fighters
included Chechens.</TE>
<TE>   "We've rid the world of hundreds of trained killers who will now not
slaughter innocent men, women and children," Hagenbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, at least so far, no Chechens have been identified among those
captured.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, few outsiders have turned up among fighters detained by
Russian forces in Chechnya. According to Prokopov of the regional
prosecutor general's office, there have been just three: two ethnic
Uighurs, members of a Muslim minority from China, and one British citizen
of Turkish descent.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, a Putin aide and his top spokesman on Chechnya,
declined to comment on the Guantanamo detainees, directing all queries to
the prosecutor general's office.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason why the Russian authorities have been trying to actively
create a logical link between Chechnya and Afghanistan in the public mind
is rather simple," said Dmitriyevsky, the friendship society official.
"They are trying hard to find a justification for the use of force and
human rights violations--or, if we call a spade a spade, war crimes--in
Chechnya."</TE>
<TE>   Vyacheslav Izmailov, military analyst for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper,
said Russia's rhetoric is dangerous because "there is a world of
difference between Afghanistan and Chechnya."</TE>
<TE>   "There is an element of terrorism in Chechnya, this is for sure, just
as there is in many other places in the world," Izmailov said. "But there
is a whole complex of reasons [for the war]. . . . If we continue to
ignore other causes of the Chechen conflict, this war will go on
forever."</TE>

<LD>CIA and FBI agents have recovered a trove of computer hard drives,
telephone books, documents and other potentially valuable material used
by Abu Zubeida and other Al Qaeda members captured last week in Pakistan,
U.S. officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The material was seized when teams of U.S. and Pakistani intelligence

Osama bin Laden, raided as many as a dozen safe houses and compounds in
central Pakistan early Thursday.</LD>

terrorist cells and plots around the world, as well as for any
information that could lead authorities to Bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi
accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   After several days of declining to comment, the White House and the
Pentagon hailed the capture of Zubeida, who is the highest-ranking Al
Qaeda leader taken into custody since the Bush administration launched a
war on terrorism more than six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Al Qaeda's top commanders are still missing. Some may have
been killed by U.S. airstrikes or fighting in Afghanistan, while others
are believed to have escaped into neighboring Pakistan, Iran or
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the Saudi-born Zubeida, who is believed to have played
a key role in recruiting terrorists and overseeing Al Qaeda operations
outside Afghanistan, would be interrogated about any knowledge he might
have of plans to conduct new attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This represents a very significant blow to Al Qaeda," said White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   He called Zubeida "a key terrorist recruiter, an operational planner
and a member of Osama bin Laden's inner circle."</TE>
<TE>   Another official said Zubeida, 31, probably was not Bin Laden's
official second in command, "but if you talk about operational
importance, the people we'd most like to see rolled up after Bin Laden,
he'd be No. 1 or No. 2."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Zubeida, more than 60 people were arrested last week,
including about two dozen suspected Al Qaeda members from the Middle East
and North Africa. The rest were mostly Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida was shot three times in the legs and groin during the raid and
has been in U.S. custody since Sunday. U.S. officials, citing security
precautions, refused to say precisely where he was being held and treated
for his wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "He's being given exactly the excellent medical care one would want if
they wanted to make sure he was around a good long time to visit with
us," Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told a news conference Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official denied published reports that Zubeida would be
transferred to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where about
300 suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban members are being held. "There's been
no decision," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The official, who requested anonymity, called Zubeida's capture a "big
deal." But he added a note of caution.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to know how severely it will disrupt their operations," he
said. "We've got to believe that it will have some significant impact,
because he was so central to their operations, particularly post-Sept.
11."</TE>
<TE>   The official would not say whether Zubeida had provided any valuable
information so far. One reason for his refusal to comment on that, he
said, was to keep other terrorists guessing.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't know what, if anything, we've gotten out of him, or what
we may have recovered from the various places that were raided," he said.
"We hope they're a little bit thrown off their feet by this and may be
concerned about what's next for them."</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Police arrested a onetime aide of former Prime Minister Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar for allegedly conspiring against the interim government of
Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, state television announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Wahidullah Sabaun and several associates linked to Hekmatyar's
Hezb-i-Islami party were arrested Monday by Afghan security forces at a
home in an upscale neighborhood of the capital.</LD>
<LD>   Television reports said they were suspected of plotting against the
government but did not give any details. For the last several years,
Sabaun had been aligned with the Northern Alliance, whose forces drove
the Taliban from power last year.</LD>
<TE>   Hekmatyar had been a vocal opponent of Karzai and of the U.S. presence
in Afghanistan, but last month his deputy said the party was ready to
cooperate with the interim administration.</TE>
<TE>   Ruthless power struggles among Hekmatyar's forces and Northern
Alliance factions devastated much of Kabul and killed 50,000 people,
mostly civilians, according to the International Committee of the Red
Cross.</TE>
<TE>   Hekmatyar fled to Iran after the Taliban took the capital in 1996. The
Iranian government recently closed his offices in Tehran, and his
whereabouts are unknown.</TE>

<DL>SRINAGAR, India
</DL>
<LD>Ten people, including one of the most wanted militants in the north
of strife-torn Jammu and Kashmir state, have been killed in fresh
separatist violence, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   An Indian army spokesman said the commander of the banned
Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba guerrilla group, Abu Hanzla, and his guard
were killed in a gun battle in Baramulla, north of Srinagar.</LD>
<LD>   Lashkar-e-Taiba and another militant group, Jaish-e-Mohammad, were
blamed by India for the deadly attack on its Parliament building Dec. 13.</LD>
<TE>   Kashmir is at the center of a military standoff between India and
Pakistan, which have fought two of their three wars over the disputed
region since 1947.</TE>
<TE>   The two nuclear rivals have close to 1 million troops mobilized on
both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, two police officers were killed when suspected separatist
guerrillas attacked a police patrol in Udhampur district, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, four rebels and two civilians were killed in shootouts in
the Himalayan Valley, police said.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen rebel groups are fighting Indian rule in the
Muslim-majority Kashmir region.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, police said they had released prominent separatist
campaigner Javid Mir, acting chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation
Front, on Tuesday, 20 hours after he had been detained for organizing a
protest in Srinagar.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Islamic militants killed 21 soldiers who were carrying out a sweep
for insurgents in northwestern Algeria, the nation's official news agency
reported Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The soldiers were ambushed Monday in Moulay Larbi in the Saida region,
about 240 miles southwest of Algiers, the capital, the APS agency
reported.</LD>
<LD>   The government troops were combing the area for suspected guerrillas,
APS said, quoting unnamed security sources.</LD>
<TE>   APS said 20 soldiers and a pro-government militiaman were killed.</TE>
<TE>   It was the highest number of government troops killed in a single
attack this year.</TE>
<TE>   APS blamed the ambush on a "terrorist group," the official term used
for Islamic rebels locked in a brutal conflict with government security
forces.</TE>
<TE>   More than 120,000 people have died in the insurgency, which broke out
in 1992 when the army canceled elections that a fundamentalist party was
expected to win.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to reconcile the North African nation, President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika promised amnesty to rebels who turned in their
weapons. The army has been hunting those who have refused to disarm.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of soldiers have been killed in ambushes and gun battles
with rebels in the last decade.</TE>

<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>In his 29 years, Mohammed Daud has seen the faces of perhaps 200
women. A few dozen were family members. The rest were glimpses stolen
when he should not have been looking and the women were caught without
their face-shrouding burkas.</LD>
<LD>   "How can you fall in love with a girl if you can't see her face?" he
asks.</LD>
<LD>   Daud is unmarried and has sex only with men and boys. But he does not
consider himself homosexual, at least not in the Western sense.</LD>
<TE>   "I like boys, but I like girls better," he says. "It's just that we
can't see the women to see if they are beautiful. But we can see the
boys, and so we can tell which of them is beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Daud, a motorbike repairman who asked that only his two first names
and not his family name be used, has a youthful face, a jaunty black
mustache and a post-Taliban cleanshaven chin. As he talks, his knee
bounces up and down, an involuntary sign of his embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   "These are hard questions you are asking," he says. "We don't usually
talk about such things."</TE>
<TE>   Though rarely acknowledged, the prevalence of sex between Afghan men
is an open secret, one most observant visitors quickly surmise.
Ironically, it is especially true here in Kandahar, which was the
heartland of the puritanical Taliban movement.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem odd to a Westerner that such a sexually repressive
society is marked by heightened homosexual activity. But Justin
Richardson, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, says such
thinking is backward--it is precisely the extreme restrictions on sexual
relations with women that lead to greater prevalence of the behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "In some Muslim societies where the prohibition against premarital
heterosexual intercourse is extremely high--higher than that against sex
between men--you will find men having sex with other males not because
they find them most attractive of all but because they find them most
attractive of the limited options available to them," Richardson says.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, sex between men can be seen as the flip side of the
segregation of women. And perhaps because the ethnic Pushtuns who
dominate Kandahar are the most religiously conservative of Afghanistan's
major ethnic groups, they have, by most accounts, a higher incidence of
homosexual relations.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors might think they see the signs. For one thing, Afghan men
tend to be more intimate with other men in public than is common in the
West. They will kiss, hold hands and drape their arms around each other
while drinking tea or talking.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there is a strong streak of dandyism among Pushtun males.
Many line their eyes with kohl, stain their fingernails with henna or
walk about town in clumsy, high-heeled sandals.</TE>
<TE>   The love by men for younger, beautiful males, who are called halekon,
is even enshrined in Pushtun literature. A popular poem by Syed Abdul
Khaliq Agha, who died last year, notes Kandahar's special reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "Kandahar has beautiful halekon," the poem goes. "They have black eyes
and white cheeks."</TE>
<TE>   But a visitor who comments on such things is likely to be told they
are not signs of homosexuality. Hugging doesn't mean sex, locals insist.
Men who use kohl and henna are simply "uneducated."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, when asked directly, few deny that a significant
percentage of men in this region have sex with men and boys. Just ask
Mullah Mohammed Ibrahim, a local cleric.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of men have the desire to commit this sin," the mullah
says. "But most are right with God and exercise control. Only 20 to 50%
of those who want to do this actually do it."</TE>
<TE>   Following the mullah's math, this suggests that between 18% and 45% of
men here engage in homosexual sex--significantly higher than the 3% to 7%
of American men who, according to studies, identify themselves as
homosexual.</TE>
<TE>   That is a large number to defy the strict version of Islam practiced
in these parts, which denounces sex between men as taboo. Muslims seeking
council from religious elders on the topic will find them unsympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   "Every person has a devil inside him," says Ibrahim. "If a person
commits this sin, it is the work of the devil."</TE>
<TE>   The Koran mandates "hard punishment" for offenders, the mullah
explains. By tradition there are three penalties: being burned at the
stake, pushed over the edge of a cliff or crushed by a toppled wall.</TE>
<TE>   During its reign in Kandahar, the Taliban implemented the latter. In
February 1998, it used a tank to push a brick wall on top of three men,
two accused of sodomy and the third of homosexual rape. The first two
died; the third spent a week in the hospital and, under the assumption
that God had spared him, was sent to prison. He served six months and
fled to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently to discourage post-Taliban visitors, the owners of a nearby
house have begun rebuilding on the site.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of foreigners came and started interviewing people," says Abdul
Baser, a 24-year-old neighbor, who points out the trench where the men
were crushed. "Since then they have rebuilt the wall."</TE>
<TE>   But many accuse the Taliban of hypocrisy on the issue of
homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "The Taliban had halekon, but they kept it secret," says one
anti-Taliban commander, who is rumored to keep two halekon. "They hid
their halekon in their madrasas," or religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only religious authorities who describe homosexual sex as
common among the Pushtun.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Mohammed Nasem Zafar, a professor at Kandahar Medical College,
estimates that about 50% of the city's male residents have sex with men
or boys at some point in their lives. He says the prime age at which boys
are attractive to men is from 12 to 16--before their beards grow in. The
adolescents sometimes develop medical problems, which he sees in his
practice, such as sexually transmitted diseases and sphincter
incontinence. So far, the doctor said, AIDS does not seem to be a problem
in Afghanistan, probably because the country is so isolated.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when the halekon grow up, the older men actually try to
keep them in the family by marrying them off to their daughters," the
doctor says.</TE>
<TE>   Zafar cites a local mullah whom he caught once using the examination
table in the doctor's one-room clinic for sex with a younger man. "If
this is our mullah, what can you say for the rest?" Zafar asks.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, the psychiatry professor, says it would be wrong to call
Afghan men homosexual, since their decision to have sex with men is not a
reflection of what Westerners call gender identity. Instead, he compares
them to prison inmates: They have sex with men primarily because they
find themselves in a situation where men are more available as sex
partners than are women.</TE>
<TE>   "It is something they do," he notes, "not something they are."</TE>
<TE>   Daud, the motorbike repairman, would concur that the segregation of
women lies at the heart of the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Daud says his first sexual experience with a man occurred when he was
20, about the time he realized that he would have difficulty marrying. In
Pushtun culture, the man has to pay for his wedding and for gifts and
clothes for the bride and her family. For many men, the bill tops
$5,000--such an exorbitant sum in this impoverished country that some
men, including Daud, are dissuaded from even trying.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to get married, but the economic situation in our
country makes it hard," Daud says.</TE>
<TE>   Daud talked about his sex life only in private and after being assured
that no photos would be taken.</TE>
<TE>   "I have relations with different boys--some for six months, some for
one month. Some are with me for six years," he says. "The problem is also
money. If you want to have a relationship with a boy, you have to buy
things for him. That's why it's not bad for the boy. Some relationships
need a lot of money, some not so much. Sometimes I fix a motorbike and
give it to him as a present."</TE>
<TE>   It is not easy to conduct homosexual affairs, he admits. Home is out
of the question.</TE>
<TE>   "If my father were to find me, he'd kick me out of the house," Daud
says. "If you want to have sex, you have to find a secret place. Some go
to the mountains or the desert."</TE>
<TE>   Opinions differ as to whether homosexual practices in Kandahar are
becoming more open or more closed since the Taliban was defeated.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, after anti-Taliban forces arrived in the city in early
December, some Westerners reported seeing commanders going about town
openly with their halekon. But that has changed in recent weeks since
Kandahar's new governor, Gul Agha Shirzai, issued an order banning boys
under 18 from living with troops. Officially, the ban is aimed at ending
the practice of using children as soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not that way," says one of the governor's top aides, Engineer
Yusuf Pashtun, objecting to the insinuation that the boys may have been
used for sex. The governor's order said only that "no boys should be
recruited in the army before the age of 18," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the anti-Taliban commander, who is close to Shirzai,
acknowledged that one goal of the order was to keep halekon out of the
barracks. The move simply drove the practice underground, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Zafar, the doctor, says that in the community at large the Taliban
frightened many men into abstinence. "Under the Taliban, no more than 10%
practiced homosexual sex," he says. "But now the government isn't paying
attention, so it may go back up to 50%."</TE>
<TE>   But Daud thinks the opposite may happen. If coeducation returns and
the dress code for women eases, men will have fewer reasons to seek
solace in the beds--or fields or storage rooms--of other men.</TE>
<TE>   "As for me, if I find someone and see she is beautiful, I will send my
mother over to her" to ask for her hand in marriage, Daud says. "I'm just
waiting to see her."</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel revoked the credentials of two Abu Dhabi TV journalists on
Tuesday and threatened legal action against CNN and NBC for ignoring
military orders and broadcasting from the Israeli-occupied West Bank city
of Ramallah.</LD>
<LD>   A statement from the Government Press Office said the press cards of
journalists Leileh Odeh and Bassam Azawi were canceled after Abu Dhabi
Television broadcast a story Sunday alleging that Israeli troops executed
a group of young men in Ramallah.</LD>
<LD>   The satellite channel's staff "have for some time operated crude
anti-Israel propaganda and have been taking a hostile and combative
attitude, creating uproar in the Arab world," the statement said, adding
that the station showed "utter disregard" for Israeli military censorship
rules.</LD>
<TE>   Israel and the Palestinians have offered contradictory accounts of how
the men in Ramallah died Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians say Israeli soldiers opened fire after the
Palestinians had surrendered.</TE>
<TE>   But the military says troops came under fire and shot back.</TE>
<TE>   The Government Press Office also said it had sent written complaints
to CNN and NBC, whose correspondents continued broadcasting from Ramallah
after Israel declared the city a closed military zone, off limits to
journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "If they do not stop violating Israeli law, the state of Israel will
be compelled to take the steps to which it is obliged by law," the
statement said, without elaborating.</TE>
<TE>   A CNN spokeswoman in New York said only that the network "is
monitoring the situation." NBC did not immediately return phone calls
asking for its response.</TE>

<HD>Gun Battles Rage in Bethlehem</HD>
<DH>Warfare: Soldiers order armed Palestinians inside Church of the
Nativity to surrender, witnesses say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIT JALA, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The people of one of the Holy Land's holiest places awoke Tuesday
to the fog and fury of war.</LD>
<LD>   In the hours before dawn, the clouded skies of Bethlehem came alive:
an Israeli reconnaissance plane, swooping F-16 fighter jets, Apache
attack helicopters with machine guns chattering. Morning brought rain and
tanks, cold winds and armored personnel carriers that rumbled over muddy
hills into the ancient city.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting crescendoed as Palestinian gunmen and Israeli soldiers
fought battles in a warren of cobblestoned lanes around Manger Square,
the site that Christians believe to be the birthplace of Jesus.</LD>
<TE>   For the first time in 18 months of fighting between Israelis and
Palestinians, combat raged in the very heart of Bethlehem, a crossroads
of Muslim, Christian and Jewish faiths. The bloodshed spilled into the
sanctuaries: Dozens of Palestinian gunmen holed up in the 4th century
Church of the Nativity, one of the oldest churches in the world, and
other houses of worship.</TE>
<TE>   The soundtrack was an unseasonable but appropriately violent
thunderstorm that, along with the shooting, continued into the night.</TE>
<TE>   "The war and the weather," muttered Maher, one of the few Palestinians
in the outlying neighborhood of Beit Jala to venture into the streets. He
peered into the mist through the windshield of his aging sedan as gunfire
rattled on the hillsides. "The war and the weather."</TE>
<TE>   Fog obscured the battlefield and, as often happens in this part of the
world, the facts. The Israel Defense Forces said 10 Palestinian gunmen
barricaded inside Santa Maria Church in central Bethlehem were holding a
priest and nuns hostage and firing on troops outside.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians, however, said the clerics, a mix of Palestinians,
Europeans and other nationalities, stayed in the church voluntarily to
protect the fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the governor of Bethlehem disputed reports that Palestinian
Authority fighters, mostly uniformed members of President Yasser Arafat's
security forces, shot their way into the Church of the Nativity. He
insisted that the fighters, dragging their wounded with them, took refuge
there when they ran out of ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   "The nuns have been giving first aid to the injured," Mohammed Madani,
the governor, said in a telephone interview from an undisclosed location
where he was lying low. "The priests are giving them food."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before midnight Tuesday, witnesses reported that Israeli tanks
massed in Manger Square and that soldiers with loudspeakers were ordering
those inside the Church of the Nativity to surrender. Palestinian sources
estimated that 150 people were inside the historic church, built over a
grotto that Christians believe to be the site of the biblical manger, and
that 120 more were in a nearby church.</TE>
<TE>   But it was difficult to confirm numbers or to separate reality from
rumor, as demonstrated by a confused and potentially inflammatory
episode. Around midday, Palestinian and European officials and
journalists claimed that Israeli soldiers had burst into a church and
killed a priest, identified by various names and described alternately as
Italian, French, Palestinian and American. One version had the supposed
victim slain while saying Mass.</TE>
<TE>   The "news" caused international consternation until the Vatican
hastily announced that the priest was alive and well. In fact, Israeli
officials said, their soldiers had taken great care to refrain from
firing on or damaging holy sites despite the presence inside of
Palestinian snipers. The erroneous report was an example of Palestinians
demonizing Israelis, the military officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lie," said an Israel Defense Forces spokesman, who asked not
to be identified. "Not one nun or priest has been wounded. What are they
going to come up with next?"</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem is about a 20-minute drive from Jerusalem, where foot and
vehicle traffic was sparse Tuesday because of the Passover holiday and
the danger posed by suicide bombers. As attacks around Israel have
produced daily death counts, residents of Jerusalem are staying away from
malls, cafes and other public places.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem and surrounding communities, the streets were even more
desolate. Maher and other residents of Beit Jala, a predominantly
Palestinian Christian enclave, hunkered down with their families and
turned on Arab-language television, which mixed news updates with
political sloganeering.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians in the area said they feared that they would be shot by
the Israeli military if they set foot outside. From weather-beaten cement
houses and sand-colored high-rises, they surveyed a bleak skyline that
juxtaposes historic towers with the unfinished hulk of a shopping center,
a project that ground to a halt as the hostilities increased in recent
months.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to work in Jerusalem," said Maher, a Christian Orthodox
stonemason and father of six who did not give his family name. "I haven't
worked for eight months. I have a friend in the United States, in
Tennessee. He called me. He said I should go there. I told him to send me
the money and I will. This is horrible here."</TE>
<TE>   Horror abruptly invaded the lives of a family near Manger Square on
Tuesday morning, according to telephone interviews. A shell fired by an
Israeli tank hit the home of the Abdeh family, killing 65-year-old
Sumayeh Abdeh and her son, Khaled, 38, according to relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Another son, Mohammed Abdeh, said in a telephone interview that five
children and four other adult relatives survived.</TE>
<TE>   Trapped because of the fighting outside, the family remained in the
house with the bodies into the night, according to Abdeh.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to keep the children away from the bodies," he said.
"Please, I need help. Is there anyone who can help me bury my mother and
my brother in my backyard?"</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, a sociology professor had a front-row seat on the
combat, which was particularly ferocious in the historic center, where
Israeli armored vehicles could not enter the narrow streets. Norma
Hasboun, who earned a doctorate in Britain and teaches at the local
university, said her anger at the assault on the Palestinian Authority
was mixed with pride at the armed resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "Today these people are fighting for their own town," she said. "The
Israelis with their sophisticated weapons are unable to control the town.
This day is very painful. After having seen our own Palestinian flag,
after having had our own television channel, the idea that you might lose
all that is very painful."</TE>

<HD>Leaders' Tacks Said to Foil U.S. Efforts</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Sharon has made it clear he wants Arafat out of the
picture, and the Palestinian believes he can out-wait him, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In deliberating its role in the raging Mideast crisis, the Bush
administration has concluded that its options are limited because Ariel
Sharon and Yasser Arafat have completely changed their strategies in
dealing with each other during the last week, according to U.S.
officials.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli prime minister has made it clear that he wants Arafat out
of commission, both as president of the Palestinian Authority and as a
partner in the peace process, the sources say. Sharon on Tuesday offered
Arafat a "one-way ticket" into exile, reflecting his goal of politically
emasculating the Palestinian leader. This is half of Sharon's new
strategy, administration officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The other half is tracking and arresting members of the militant cells
behind the spate of suicide bombings targeting Israelis almost daily--a
job Arafat has repeatedly refused to do despite earlier pledges to help
end the violence.</LD>
<TE>   In the Palestinian Authority, Arafat's strategy is now based largely
on his own physical survival, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat is playing as if all he has to do is survive, and then he
wins. He can lose people, buildings, even infrastructure. But by his own
survival, he believes he can raise the cost so high that the Israeli body
politic will vote Sharon out and reelect the Labor Party, with whom he
can make peace," said a well-placed U.S. official who asked to remain
anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   The two strategies are based on the same premise: Each leader
apparently has concluded that he cannot make peace while the other is in
power. And each man is taking steps to undermine the effectiveness--and
even the rule--of the other.</TE>
<TE>   "The calculus of neither party favors peace," the official added.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing little flexibility for compromise, the United States is working
to have a peace process in place so that the two sides can get back to
the negotiating table once the Israelis' military operation in the West
Bank is complete.</TE>
<TE>   "When this current, terrible crisis we are in right now passes--the
Israeli army finishes its sweeps of these various cities and towns--we
will be right back to seeking a political solution. And that political
solution will need two parties, the Israelis and Palestinians. And
Chairman Arafat is the leader of the Palestinian movement," Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell said on Fox News Channel's "Fox &amp; Friends."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the United States appears willing to tolerate, albeit
reluctantly, the second half of Sharon's strategy. Washington indicated
for the first time Tuesday that it would not move to deter Israel from
its incursions into Palestinian-controlled areas to round up suspected
extremists, an operation Powell said is expected to last at least two
more weeks and probably longer.</TE>
<TE>   "What they're doing is routing out terrorists. What they're doing is
picking up weapons. What they're doing is trying to destroy this
infrastructure of terrorism. And we understand that," Powell said Tuesday
on ABC's "Good Morning America."</TE>
<TE>   In conversations with Sharon, however, U.S. officials have made it
clear that he should "get it over as quickly as possible," Powell added
on CBS' "The Early Show."</TE>
<TE>   But the administration is not willing to accept the other half of the
new Israeli strategy, Powell noted during appearances on all five network
morning programs Tuesday. "We think Arafat still has a role to play," he
said on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Powell called Sharon again Tuesday, according to the State Department.
His message included a warning not to leave Arafat at the top of a
structure with nothing underneath, creating a political vacuum that would
allow his rivals in the Hamas and Islamic Jihad extremist groups to step
in.</TE>
<TE>   "The message was that even though Arafat has so far chosen not to
confront the extremists, don't leave him in a place where he'll never be
able to confront them. There are dangerous consequences if you leave him
at the top but also leave him powerless," said an administration official
who asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   To help defuse the mounting Arab frustration and anger at the United
States, Assistant Secretary of State William Burns met with 15
ambassadors Tuesday for what was described as a "quick powwow."</TE>
<TE>   The State Department asked the Arab envoys to pressure Arafat to take
bold steps to end the violence as soon as possible, calling this the key
to ending the Israeli siege. U.S. diplomats also reassured the envoys
that Washington was in turn urging Israel to withdraw from the
Palestinian-controlled areas.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials acknowledge that some governments may relay the message
to Arafat, while several may not.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working with several Arab states, but at times their message is
that there is only so much we can do in this environment," said a State
Department official.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has also made clear that it does not intend to
intervene in the current showdown. On the morning television programs,
Powell deflected the growing number of suggestions--including one from
his predecessor, Madeleine Albright--that he travel to the region, saying
he was prepared to make his third trip to the Mideast as soon as he felt
he could accomplish something.</TE>
<TE>   But there was little other diplomatic action Tuesday. "We're in one of
those periods when there's a lot of activity but no movement," the State
Department official added.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Will Divert Retirement Funds, Raising the Stakes in Debt-Limit
Fight</HD>
<DH>Finance: Congress has delayed a tough vote on lifting the ceiling.
The move is temporary before a flood of tax return money comes in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill notified Congress on Tuesday
that he would begin tapping federal employee retirement funds this week
to prevent the government from breaching its $5.95-trillion debt ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to congressional leaders, O'Neill said he would stop
investing retirement funds in Treasury securities beginning Thursday and
place them in a non-interest-bearing account instead. The funds will be
restored about two weeks later, he said, after the April 15 filing
deadline generates a flood of income tax payments.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill's move will provide only a brief reprieve, Treasury officials
said. Unless Congress votes soon to raise the debt ceiling, within a few
weeks the government will again run the risk of defaulting on its
financial obligations.</LD>
<TE>   "I know that you share the president's and my commitment to
maintaining the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, especially
at this critical time," O'Neill said in his letter. He urged lawmakers to
raise the ceiling "as quickly as possible to avoid any negative
repercussions at home or abroad."</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury secretary promised that government workers "will suffer
no adverse consequences" from the fund diversion. His Clinton
administration predecessor, Robert E. Rubin, took similar steps in 1995
during a budget standoff with congressional Republicans, O'Neill noted.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the move shows that Treasury officials are fast running out
of room to maneuver while Congress delays a politically awkward vote to
raise the debt ceiling in the middle of an election-year debate over tax
cuts and deficit spending.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats see the issue as an opportunity to blame President Bush's
tax cuts for the return of deficit spending after five years of
government surpluses. Republicans say that last year's $1.35-trillion tax
reduction contributed relatively little to the immediate fiscal crunch,
which was accelerated by the recession, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
and changing budgetary assumptions. But they want to delay a vote on the
debt ceiling until it can be packaged with a more politically appealing
measure, such as an anti-terrorism funding bill to be taken up in coming
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a totally dysfunctional debate," said Robert Bixby, executive
director of the Concord Coalition, a watchdog group that advocates
balanced budgets. "The debt is going up, the debt ceiling has to be
raised, and forcing the Treasury secretary to go through such
machinations is disgraceful."</TE>
<TE>   The ceiling, which dates to World War I, has been raised repeatedly
over the years as the government's debts have accumulated. It applies not
only to the total amount of Treasury securities held by the public but
also to the IOUs issued to government trust funds such as Social Security
and the Federal Employees Retirement System. Because the trust funds have
been taking in more money than they pay out, the debt ceiling would have
to be raised some day even if the government managed to pay off the
public debt.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the Bush administration said that day would not arrive
until 2008 at the earliest. But it began rolling back its projections
last fall as the recession caused tax collections to fall and spending on
benefit programs to rise, and the war on terrorism caused federal outlays
to grow even more.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill began lobbying Congress late last year to increase the ceiling
by $750 million, to $6.7 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   The ceiling was last raised in 1997, but the budgetary standoff
preceding the vote forced Rubin to employ a variety of stopgap strategies
to avert an unprecedented default on the government's financial
obligations.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Roseboro, assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets,
said the temporary diversion of federal employee retirement funds will
ensure that the government can make required payments during the first
two weeks of April. They include benefit checks totaling $30 billion for
Social Security recipients and $18 billion for Medicare and Medicaid
participants, $20 billion in income tax refunds, and $6 billion in wages
for government employees and military personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro said the administration had "taken all prudent steps to avoid
reaching the statutory debt limit," including reducing the size of
Treasury bill auctions and drawing down cash reserves. Suspending the
investment of retirement funds so they won't count against the debt limit
will buy a little time, he said, but Congress will still need to act
relatively soon.</TE>
<TE>   "The April 15 tax inflows will only postpone our breaching the debt
ceiling for a few months," he said.</TE>
<TE>   David Wyss, chief economist for Standard &amp; Poor's, said bond traders
regard the current impasse as more of a temporary aggravation than a
cause for alarm. Even so, it has a disruptive effect "because you've got
to change auction schedules, and money gets taken out of that market."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Treasury officials "have to play games," Wyss said.
"They've got to move monies around, they've got to borrow from pension
funds, they've got to do all sorts of other odd things."</TE>

<HD>Priest Charged in Boy's Rape</HD>
<DH>Religion: Extradition of Father Ferraro to Boston, in a case two
decades old, adds to the furor over sex abuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>The scandal over clerical sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church
gathered new momentum as an ordained priest was arraigned Tuesday in New
York, charged with raping a boy in Massachusetts more than two decades
ago.</LD>
<LD>   After his arrest Monday on a fugitive warrant, Father Romano Ferraro
of Queens, N.Y., became the first priest to face extradition to
Massachusetts since the January trial here of defrocked priest John J.
Geoghan unleashed worldwide controversy over pedophilia in the Catholic
Church.</LD>
<LD>   The furor prompted public apologies from officials as prominent as
Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston, the highest-ranking prelate in the
United States. Church officials also have engaged in unprecedented
collaboration with local authorities, handing over the names of hundreds
of clergy members suspected of abuse.</LD>
<TE>   Ferraro, 67, is being held without bail in New York. Massachusetts
officials were uncertain Tuesday when he would be brought here.</TE>
<TE>   Ferraro never held a post in the Boston Archdiocese, which sits at the
center of a storm that has gained steady force since church officials
admitted in court documents that, despite knowing some priests were
molesting children, they did nothing to stop the abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office here said Ferraro is accused of raping
and sexually assaulting a boy while visiting in Billerica, north of
Boston, from 1973 to 1980, when the victim was 7 to 13 years old.</TE>
<TE>   A former Navy chaplain who also worked as a priest in New Jersey,
Ferraro has served at five parishes in the Diocese of Brooklyn. He was
suspended of all duties about 12 years ago after a separate allegation of
sexual misconduct in Queens, diocese spokesman Frank DeRosa said.</TE>
<TE>   DeRosa said Ferraro had received counseling after the 1988 allegation.
He was uncertain what function within the church Ferraro had been playing
since then.</TE>
<TE>   Emily LaGrassa, a spokeswoman for Middlesex County Dist. Atty. Martha
Coakley, said the Boston victim, now 35 years old, reported the alleged
abuse by Ferraro to the district attorney's child abuse unit last fall,
before the Geoghan case unfolded.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan is serving a sentence of up to 10 years for fondling a boy at
a community swimming pool. Since his trial, lawyers for the Boston
Archdiocese have given prosecutors the names of more than 80 priests
accused of molesting children over a 40-year period.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese recently reached a civil settlement of $20 million to
$30 million with more than 80 of Geoghan's alleged victims. Two other
criminal complaints against Geoghan were dropped when a judge ruled that
the statute of limitations had expired.</TE>
<TE>   In Massachusetts, the statute of limitations for abuse charges
normally is 10 years from the time of the assault or 10 years since the
alleged victim turned 16.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the Ferraro case is exempt from such constrictions
because there is no statute of limitations in Massachusetts when a
suspect leaves the district.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, meanwhile, a seminary priest resigned Monday over
allegations that he sexually abused a teenager in New York in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. William White, 69, resigned after the president of St. Vincent
de Paul Regional Seminary in Boynton Beach discovered that the
Archdiocese of New York had settled a case in 1997 for $100,000 involving
alleged abuse by White.</TE>
<TE>   White did not admit to the abuse; he said his actions were
misinterpreted, seminary president Stephen Bosso said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Mahony, 42, of Salem, Ore., said White abused him for three
years, beginning when he was a high school senior.</TE>
<TE>   And in New Jersey on Monday, Associated Press reported that a family
was trying to convince a court that it should be able to sue the Diocese
of Camden over alleged sexual abuse that took place nearly 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Civil claims in child sex abuse cases in New Jersey generally must be
filed by the time the victim reaches age 20, but the law allows
exceptions when the victim can show that duress or mental instability
delayed the filing.</TE>
<TE>   DeRosa, at the Diocese of Brooklyn, said he was confident that the
court system will deal appropriately with Father Ferraro. "The church is
a divine institution," he said. "It will not die. It will not go away.
But it is going through a rough time now."</TE>

<HD>Hanssen Spied for the Money, Report to Say</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Webster panel will detail ex-FBI agent's motivation and
disclose the bureau's widespread security deficiencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Former FBI agent Robert Philip Hanssen has told government
investigators that his 22-year career as a Russian spy was driven by
money as he sought to cover house payments and parochial school tuition
for his six children, law enforcement sources said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Hanssen's admission, disclosed in a high-level report due out
Thursday, marks the first time he has divulged his motivation for spying.
The report from the Webster Commission also identifies widespread
security failings in the FBI counterintelligence operation and offers
numerous recommendations on how to fix them, including more frequent use
of polygraphs for agents and tightened access to secret information, said
people familiar with the review.</LD>
<LD>   "In every area of security--document security, physical security,
personnel security, computer security--the FBI's system was absolutely
dysfunctional," according to a person familiar with the Webster report
who asked not to be identified.</LD>
<TE>   The 13-month review, led by former FBI and CIA Director William H.
Webster, was aimed at analyzing the worst episode of espionage in FBI
history and determining how Hanssen was able to elude detection for so
long in selling top-secret material to the Russians, beginning in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen was arrested in February 2001 after he dropped off a new batch
of documents for his Russian handlers in a park near his suburban
Virginia home. He pleaded guilty last June to espionage charges in a deal
that spared him the death penalty, as he admitted that he sold numerous
national security secrets in exchange for $1.4 million in cash and
diamonds.</TE>
<TE>   With two new books out on Hanssen, speculation has only intensified
about one of the few lingering mysteries in the notorious case: What
drove him? Some who knew Hanssen have suggested it was the sheer "thrill"
of the spy game. Others said it was his intellectual arrogance and a
desire to outfox FBI colleagues whom he looked down upon. Others thought
it was simple greed, or perhaps even a mental defect borne of his
father's rough treatment of him as a child.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen was interviewed earlier this year over a period of several
days by Webster Commission investigators, and he sought to put the
question to rest in his own words.</TE>
<TE>   "He needed the money," according to an official familiar with the
report's account of the Hanssen interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen told debriefers that he first made contact with the Soviets in
the late 1970s after he was reassigned from Indianapolis to the FBI's New
York City bureau, where living expenses were much higher and he was
having trouble keeping up with his house payments in Scarsdale.</TE>
<TE>   "He blamed [the start of his espionage career] on the move to New
York," the official said. "That's when he started. He had more house than
he could afford."</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Hanssen told debriefers, he was confronted with other
financial demands--including the desire as a devout Roman Catholic father
to put his six children through expensive parochial schools and college.
He also used some of the money to lavish a car and other expensive gifts
on a Washington stripper in an apparent attempt to "save" her, Hanssen
told commission investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen also told investigators that he now realizes what he did was
wrong, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   While Hanssen confirmed that he had passed numerous secrets to the
Russians, he apparently did not divulge any new material that he may have
sold, according to sources familiar with the report. Investigators
already have an extensive understanding of the damage Hanssen caused to
national security by giving the Russians key information about U.S.
intelligence programs and methods, and by helping unmask at least three
Soviets who were spying for the Americans. The Soviets later executed all
three.</TE>
<TE>   The Webster Commission, appointed by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft last
year and made up of senior officials in law enforcement and national
security, is expected to conclude that Hanssen slipped through the cracks
for more than two decades in part because of inattention to internal
security, antiquated computers and a byzantine management system.</TE>
<TE>   Key clues to Hanssen's behavior that could have served as a "tripwire"
for further investigation were overlooked, sources said. For instance,
there were a number of inconsistencies raised in Hanssen's periodic
background reviews through the 1970s, such as whether an infusion of cash
for a room addition came from an inheritance he had gotten or from his
wife's family. But the inconsistencies were never pursued, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the report concludes that Hanssen was able to nimbly
navigate the FBI's computer system to get access to sensitive information
and to periodically check whether anyone had opened an investigation into
his own espionage activities.</TE>
<TE>   The report recommends that the FBI conduct polygraph tests every five
years of agents with access to sensitive material and that it severely
restrict access to sensitive information among its personnel, sources
said. Where new FBI agents are now routinely given top-secret clearance
when they join the bureau, the commission recommends that such clearance
be limited to a "need to know" basis.</TE>

cherry trees in Washington, D.C. The 90-year-old trees are at their
blooming peak this week. Defying fears that tourists wouldn't make the
trek this year because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, thousands are
converging on the area for the annual Cherry Blossom Festival. The trees
were a gift from Japan in 1912 as a symbol of friendship.</CP>

<LD>Georgetown Mayor Koleen Brooks, a former stripper accused of baring
her breasts in a bar and mishandling her job, was ousted by a landslide
vote in a recall election.</LD>
<LD>   The final tally was 339 to 176.</LD>
<LD>   Brooks said she would run for mayor again next year. She said she
wasn't disappointed over losing. "It probably just saved me 10 years on
my life," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Town Clerk Phyllis Mehrer said 61% of Georgetown's registered voters
cast ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks, 37, was elected mayor of this old mining town 45 miles west of
Denver in April. Zoning changes are the stated reason for the recall.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>A deported Egyptian who arrived on a flight from Spain with box
cutters in his briefcase was charged Tuesday with attempting to enter the
United States illegally, federal prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Aly Sabra Galal Abdelella, 29, was arrested Friday after arriving at
Miami International Airport on Iberia Airlines Flight 6123.</LD>
<LD>   He was stopped by inspectors after they found he had been deported
from New York in January by an immigration judge after arriving in the
country last summer, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   An Immigration and Naturalization Service search of the man's
briefcase turned up the box cutters, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have banned passengers from carrying small blades,
including box cutters, because authorities believe they were used by the
Sept. 11 hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   It is a federal crime for an alien previously deported or removed from
the United States to attempt to re-enter the country without permission.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelella faces a maximum of two years in prison, a fine of $250,000
and up to three years of supervised release, the U.S. attorney's office
said in a written statement.</TE>

<HD>Ill. Governor's Campaign, 2 Former Top Aides Indicted</HD>
<DH>Courts: Lengthy inquiry leads to racketeering accusations in a case
involving state workers. Ryan is not charged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Illinois Gov. George Ryan's campaign committee and two top former
aides were indicted Tuesday on racketeering charges, the most damaging in
a series of indictments and convictions that helped prompt the
once-promising governor to give up a run for a second term.</LD>
<LD>   The indictments were the latest in a federal investigation dubbed
Operation Safe Roads, which has focused on Ryan's tenure as secretary of
state in the mid-1990s. The probe began as an inquiry into truck drivers
paying bribes in exchange for commercial driver's licenses, with some of
that ill-gotten money ending up in Ryan's gubernatorial campaign coffers.
It has resulted in 42 convictions.</LD>
<LD>   "The indictment alleges that Citizens for Ryan, as a campaign, for a
number of years broke the law with considerable vigor," U.S. Atty.
Patrick Fitzgerald said. "Public funds were stolen and plundered for
political benefit."</LD>
<TE>   Scott Fawell, 44, was charged with racketeering, mail fraud and
conspiracy to obstruct justice. He served as Ryan's campaign manager and
chief of staff when Ryan was secretary of state.</TE>
<TE>   Fawell's chief lieutenant, Richard Juliano, 34, faces the same
charges. His lawyer, however, said he has been cooperating with
prosecutors for several months and has agreed to plead guilty to one
count of mail fraud. Juliano became a liaison between the U.S. Department
of Transportation and the Bush administration before resigning last week,
according to the U.S. attorney's office here.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, 67, has not been charged in the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "The message sent today is that tax dollars are not free money . . .
to be used for campaign purposes or for the personal benefit of those who
work" for a political official, Fitzgerald said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   For three years, federal prosecutors have alleged that when Ryan was
secretary of state, a handful of his underlings pressured driver's
license office managers to raise funds for his gubernatorial campaign.
Driver Services Department authorities accepted bribes, prosecutors say,
in exchange for issuing driver's licenses to under-qualified motorists,
mostly commercial truck drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme probably raised a relatively paltry $170,000 for Ryan's
successful 1998 gubernatorial bid, prosecutors say, but the results have
been devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Almost since Ryan's election, the so-called licenses-for-bribes
scandal has dominated the local headlines. His massive overhaul of the
troubled transportation system, and even his nationally recognized
moratorium on the death penalty, have been overshadowed here.</TE>
<TE>   As in the Enron Corp. debacle, prosecutors allege that many of the
misdeeds here took place in an attempt to cover up previous ones.</TE>
<TE>   The 80-page indictment alleges Fawell, Juliano and the campaign not
only created false documents to account for how the funds were spent,
they also shredded real ones.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment also seeks to retrieve about $1 million raised and
spent by Citizens for Ryan over several years in the mid-1990s, which
could open the door to yet more prosecutions of allies who worked on his
1998 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan's announcement in August that he would not seek a second term
prompted a heated primary. After 25 years of GOP governorships,
Democratic U.S. Rep. Rod R. Blagojevich hopes to retake the statehouse in
Springfield but faces a tough campaign against two-term Republican state
Atty. Gen. Jim Ryan, no relation to the governor, in November.</TE>

<HD>Bush, in Pennsylvania, Touts Early-Childhood Education</HD>
<DH>Schools: President calls development programs for the nation's
youngest children 'incredibly important.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>Maintaining a business-as-usual attitude despite the turmoil in the
Middle East, President Bush traveled to Pennsylvania on Tuesday to
promote early-childhood education and to help raise $1 million for the
Republican gubernatorial candidate.</LD>
<LD>   "It is important for our nation to remember we have other important
responsibilities," Bush told an audience of several hundred at Penn State
University's Delaware County campus. Early-childhood education is "an
incredibly important issue."</LD>
<LD>   Despite the war on terrorism and the quest for world peace, he added:
"My administration will not be distracted from these goals. As we fight
for freedom, I also understand that freedom means no child in America
will be left behind."</LD>
<TE>   Before his address, Bush met privately with a dozen early-childhood
education experts. At the end of that session, reporters were ushered
into the conference room, where they pelted the president with questions
about the Middle East--none of which he answered.</TE>
<TE>   From the campus in suburban Philadelphia, the president drove into
center-city Philadelphia to attend a fund-raiser for Republican Atty.
Gen. Mike Fisher, who is running for governor. The event was expected to
raise $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The president's latest initiative is a follow-up to a commitment he
made during his State of the Union address three months ago, in which he
stressed the need to prepare young children for school through Head Start
and other development programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to make sure that every child starts at the same point. If
we expect achievement from every child, all our children need to begin
school with an equal chance at achievement," Bush said Tuesday. "Every
child must have an equal place at the starting line. . . . That is the
national goal."</TE>
<TE>   Head Start, which aids low-income families, provides a range of social
and emotional development programs at an average cost of $6,800 per
child--an amount that has tripled over the last decade, according to
Margaret Spellings, the president's domestic policy advisor.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the estimated 900,000 children enrolled in Head Start are
not benefiting fully, she said. Some states do not coordinate what
children do before entering school with what is expected of them in the
classroom, she noted. In addition, many programs insufficiently assess
how they prepare students for school, and some of the program's nearly
50,000 teachers are inadequately trained.</TE>
<TE>   To strengthen Head Start, Bush is directing the Department of Health
and Human Services to implement an accountability system to ensure that
every Head Start center assesses standards of learning in early literacy,
language and numerical skills. This would not involve testing children.</TE>
<TE>   The department also is to develop a training project to help teachers
improve their techniques in teaching pre-reading and language skills.</TE>
<TE>   The president further is asking states to better "align" preschool
activities with K-12 standards.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Bush is seeking $45 million in new funding for research into
effective early-literacy programs and teaching techniques.</TE>
<TE>   The themes that the president laid out here built upon Laura Bush's
Summit on Early Childhood Cognitive Development last July.</TE>
<TE>   The president said that his wife, a former school librarian, would
soon release a series of booklets containing information on child
development that government agencies will make widely available.</TE>
<TE>   The president also is scheduled to promote early-childhood education,
focusing public awareness on Head Start in a speech today in the East
Room of the White House.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) hailed Bush for
promoting the issue, calling early-childhood education "the next great
frontier" in education reform. But he criticized the president for not
providing more money for the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Without new resources, this important initiative is a hollow gesture.
It is wrong for the president to ask states to accept this great new
responsibility within their existing budgets. We cannot require states to
do more for our children with less," Kennedy said. "Children and parents
deserve real results and not just rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy is developing legislation, along with Sen. George Voinovich
(R-Ohio), among others, to provide at least $1 billion to states to
improve early-childhood education.</TE>
<TE>   "To make a real difference for our youngest children, we must add
flesh to the bones of the president's commitment," said Kennedy, who
worked closely with Bush on the sweeping education reform legislation
that the president signed in January.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the "nation's toughest sheriff"
who put inmates in tents and pink underwear, ended weeks of speculation
Tuesday by saying he won't run for governor.</LD>
<LD>   Arpaio, 69, had made a strong showing in polls but said his decision
to remain the sheriff of Arizona's most populous county, which includes
Phoenix, "is the right thing to do."</LD>
<LD>   "I just want to go out into the sunset as a law enforcement officer,"
he said.</LD>
<TE>   The retired drug enforcement agent was elected sheriff in 1992 and
became known for placing inmates in tents to reduce crowding, dressing
them in pink underwear to reduce theft of jail property and
reestablishing chain gangs in old-fashioned striped uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed "the nation's toughest sheriff" by a tabloid, Arpaio's 10 years
in office have been marred by over-budget spending and lawsuits alleging
brutality against inmates. One suit over a 1996 death resulted in an
$8-million settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Polls found Arpaio and former Rep. Matt Salmon in a dead heat for the
Sept. 10 primary among likely Republican voters, trailed by three others.</TE>
<TE>   GOP Gov. Jane Dee Hull is barred by term limits from seeking
reelection.</TE>

<HD>Reagan Library Ready to Break Ground on Air Force One
Exhibit</HD>
<DH>History: The $20-million expansion will display the Boeing
707 used by five presidents. Visitors will be able to walk through
the aircraft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RODNEY BOSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since acquiring the Air Force One used by the former president,
officials at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Simi Valley
have been preparing for a $20-million expansion to showcase the
retired aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   The new Air Force One pavilion and a separate auditorium and
gallery will more than double the size of what is already the largest
presidential library in the country. Groundbreaking is scheduled for
next month, with the "flying White House" exhibit set to open in May
2004.</LD>
<LD>   The Boeing 707 aircraft--used by Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter,
Reagan and Bush--is on permanent loan to the library from the U.S.
Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio. The jet was flown in September to
San Bernardino International Airport, where it remains in storage.</LD>
<TE>   The only other Air Force One on public display is the Boeing 707
used by Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. It is on permanent exhibit at the
Ohio museum.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we think it is so significant for Ventura County,"
said Mark Burson, executive director of the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Foundation. "We are within one hour's drive time to 10
million people.... It will really help Ventura County become a
destination."</TE>
<TE>   The 112,000-square-foot expansion will be built at the north end
of the hilltop library, with the historic plane facing a glass wall
with a postcard view of the rolling Simi hills.</TE>
<TE>   "It will look like she's flying right out the window," said
library director R. Duke Blackwood.</TE>
<TE>   An elevated walkway will wrap around the aircraft, leading
visitors to the entrance of the cockpit. As they walk along, there
will be displays recounting Reagan's historic conferences with former
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The focus will be on the three
summits Reagan traveled to aboard Air Force One, including Geneva in
1985, Reykjavik in 1986 and Moscow in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to tell the history of the plane, but also in context
with Reagan's presidency," Blackwood said.</TE>
<TE>   As they walk through the aircraft, visitors will take an audio
tour that re-creates the sounds of an Air Force One flight. "We want
to immerse the visitor," Blackwood said. "You can hear the ambient
sounds. The cockpit voices. The shuffling of papers. The
conversations."</TE>
<TE>   On the pavilion floor next to the plane will be a bulletproof
limousine used by Reagan, police motorcycles, a chase car and several
mannequins resembling Secret Service agents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping it will have a kind of kinetic effect," architect
Daniel Clinger said of his vision for the display. "It will look like
it's ready to move or moving."</TE>
<TE>   Library officials also hope to acquire a Marine Corps One
helicopter and an F-14 escort jet to complete the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   At the entrance to the pavilion will be a glass-enclosed colonnade
and exhibit hall that will include a history of the Air Force One
fleet. A timeline will begin with President Roosevelt's 1945 flight
aboard the C-54 "Sacred Cow" and continue through to George W. Bush's
current Air Force One, a more spacious and luxurious Boeing 747.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the aircraft pavilion, there will be a separate
two-level structure that will house a presidential learning center
consisting of an auditorium and gallery space. The atrium-like
structure will be built with $8 million in federal money, while the
$12-million aircraft pavilion will be paid for with private
donations.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be the most posh airplane hangar ever," Clinger joked.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force One exhibit is expected to attract more patrons to
the 10-year-old Reagan library, which now includes a museum
chronicling the former president's life and 55 million presidential
papers administered by the U.S. National Archives and Records,
officials said. The library had more than 200,000 visitors last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force donated the retired Air Force One to the library in
August, which museum officials consider a major coup because of the
plane's history. It is the plane Nixon flew back to California in
after resigning in disgrace. Ford tumbled down its steps on a visit
to Salzburg, Austria. And Reagan flew to a divided Berlin to demand
that Gorbachev "tear down this wall."</TE>
<TE>   "I think people all over the country will be fascinated by it,"
said Chester A. Newland, a distinguished professor of public
administration at USC. But because all presidential libraries "are
very much a glorification of the president," the visitor should
proceed through them with an objective eye, said Newland, who served
as the first director of the Lyndon B. Johnson library in Austin,
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times when I think the presidential trappings are too
extravagant," he said, "but I would leave that up to people to
decide."</TE>

<LD>A former associate pastor at a Canoga Park church was sentenced
Tuesday to serve 32 months in state prison for failing to register as
a sex offender.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Henry Ilger, 50, of West Hills was taken into custody
immediately after Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Kathryne
Ann Stoltz sentenced him at the Van Nuys courthouse.</LD>
<LD>   Stoltz rejected defense attorney Edward M. Robinson's plea that
Ilger, a former second-grade teacher who was convicted in 1988 of
molesting four female students in his San Luis Obispo classroom, be
sentenced to probation.</LD>
<TE>   Robinson had said his client is "a significantly changed man" and
unlikely to molest other children.</TE>
<TE>   But Stoltz said Ilger put himself into another position of trust
by becoming an associate pastor at Hope Chapel of the Valley, a
Christian Pentecostal church in Canoga Park. The church announced
last month that he was removed from his position.</TE>
<TE>   "He represented himself as somebody who is trustworthy and in this
case he lied ... and deceived people," the judge said. Under state
law, sex offenders must register annually and each time they change
addresses, Deputy Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Andrea Thompson
said.</TE>
<TE>   After serving four years in state prison, Ilger moved to the San
Fernando Valley but did not notify authorities when he moved.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded guilty in February to one count of failing to register
as a sex offender between June 16, 1992, and June 8, 2001, when Los
Angeles police arrested him. Because it was a third-strike
conviction, Ilger faced up to 25 years to life in prison. Prosecutors
sought at least 32 months in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson said in court that Ilger never tried to conceal his
whereabouts from authorities. Nor has he had any other brushes with
the law.</TE>
<TE>   But Thompson argued that Ilger concealed his past from neighbors
who have a right under state law to know whether a sex offender is
living in their midst.</TE>
<TE>   "He lived openly in West Hills as Paul Ilger, pastor of Hope
Chapel of the Valley," she said. "What he did hide was that Paul
Ilger, convicted child molester, also lived there."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Deyan, 43, of Van Nuys, a former church member, told the
court he was upset that he and other church members were not told
immediately about Ilger's criminal past.</TE>
<TE>   Deyan told the court that Ilger downplayed the seriousness of his
offense, once telling Deyan that he served prison time for his work
as an environmental activist.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust is a very important issue," Deyan said. "And trust was
violated by Mr. Ilger."</TE>
<TE>   Another former church member, Mark Spicer of Winnetka, 36, said in
court that his 11-year-old daughter swam at Ilger's house. "I placed
my daughter in this man's trust," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As Stoltz was sentencing Ilger, one of his two daughters, who had
been sitting with their mother, was escorted from the courtroom
sobbing loudly.</TE>
<TE>   Another woman was removed from the court by sheriff's deputies as
she yelled, "He didn't lie!"</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, the Rev. Jeff Fischer said his church has
adopted new safeguards, including background checks for employees.</TE>
<TE>   "We did the best we could with the information we had to protect
people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer and other church members have stood by Ilger and his
family since his arrest in June. They wrote letters asking the court
for leniency.</TE>
<TE>   Moments before the hearing started Tuesday, a dozen church
members, led by Fischer, gathered in the back of the courtroom and
prayed with Ilger.</TE>
