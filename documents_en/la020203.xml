<HD>Often It's Not the Giving That's Tough, It's the Deciding</HD>
<DH>Even simple acts of charity can pose a complicated tangle
of ethical questions.</DH>

<LD>In Maine, where Rushworth Kidder lives, residents understand that if
they are driving along in a snowstorm and see someone who has slid
off the road, they stop and help.</LD>
<LD>   It is further understood, says Kidder, founder and president of
the Institute for Global Ethics, that the person pulled from the
ditch owes nothing. "The obligation is that he needs to pull the next
person out of the ditch. He needs to pass it on, and in that regard,
we've all been pulled out of the ditch in many ways."</LD>
<LD>   Even simple forms of giving, however, can become complicated. What
if the passing driver is running late to the airport for an important
trip and would miss a flight by stopping? What if the person in need
seems suspicious or is an unskilled driver who might cause tragedy
further down the road?</LD>
<TE>   For many, the ethics of giving--of how we share time and
assets--has come into sharper focus since Sept. 11. In an
unprecedented response, more than $1 billion was donated to help
victims of the attacks. That call was answered, but there are many
more. In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Bush
urged Americans to commit at least two years--4,000 hours in their
lifetimes--to the service of neighbors and nation.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of whom to help is vast. In addition to the person on
the street asking for a dollar, there are 1.23 million charities,
social welfare organizations and religious congregations seeking
support. Imagine 1.23 million cars in the ditch. Which ones do you
pull out?</TE>
<TE>   The ones with frightened children in it?</TE>
<TE>   The ones with old people?</TE>
<TE>   The ones with no heat?</TE>
<TE>   What are our ethics when it comes to giving? To whom should we
give? And how much and when?</TE>
<TE>   Ethics in giving is not only a question of right versus wrong,
Kidder says, but principally a question of right versus right. "The
most important ethical decision-making methodology, it seems to me,
is the one that allows you to think carefully about the needs of
competing right things."</TE>
<TE>   The discussion of the ethics of giving, says Paul Shervish,
sociology professor and director of the Social Welfare Research
Institute at Boston College, should begin with two questions: What is
most needed? Is it being provided?</TE>
<TE>   "A major ethical issue is to separate out and to pursue what is
needed rather than what is simply good or generous," he says. It is a
process of discernment, Shervish says, that begins with learning to
receive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a way that we deal with things when we truly understand
being given to is a blessing," he says. "It's one of the deepest
feelings we have, and when we can give to others, it's that circle of
the deepest connection that you can have with someone."</TE>
<TE>   Giving, of course, is not always purely altruistic and can be
motivated by the desire to earn a tax break, further a political
agenda or raise one's social standing. There are many motives, many
ways to give, many causes, many needs.</TE>
<TE>   Those who gave to victims of the Sept. 11 attacks are watching to
make sure the money is used appropriately, and those in charge of the
funds must now determine how the money should be distributed,
effectively and ethically.</TE>
<TE>   Charity, even in its purest form, it's not a simple process.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think making money raises ethical questions," says Kidder,
"you should try giving it away."</TE>
<TE>   Australian philosopher Peter Singer, a professor at Princeton
University's Center for Human Values, says that in terms of global
need, the amount given to victims of the Sept. 11 attacks seems
disproportionate.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, it's another way of showing that Americans really care
for Americans, but they don't really think about the needs of people
elsewhere in the world who equally, through no fault of their own,
are in much greater need," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Singer, who has advocated for animal rights and in some cases
euthanasia, also suggests that money spent on nonessential items be
instead given to help meet the essential needs of others.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations estimates that 24,000 people around the world
die each day from hunger-related causes. Knowing that, how much,
ethically, should we keep for ourselves?</TE>
<TE>   Singer says the United States gives a smaller percentage of its
gross national product in foreign aid than any other of the developed
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The survivors of the approximately 3,000 victims of the Sept. 11
attacks will receive about 10% of what is given to 1.2 billion people
who are arguably in as great or greater need, Singer says.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a soft spot, an area of vulnerability, for many who
find meaning in giving, it is in knowing they could give more. And
establishing that line between giving and keeping marks a difficult
balance--no matter how much one has to divide.</TE>
<TE>   Singer, married and father to three grown children, says he
donates 20% of his household income to hunger relief agencies. "I
could still give more," he says, "I can't give you a sound ethical
reason why I don't. I think, for me, having been through the ethics,
I then get to a point where what I think I ought to be doing comes
into conflict with what I want to do in terms of my own selfish
interests, and I'm not saintly enough to completely disregard that."</TE>
<TE>   To help guide them through the process of giving, many people make
the decision to give suggested percentages of their income to
religious groups, the United Way or other nonprofit organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Richard and Lezlie Atlas give through their Atlas Family
Foundation. Richard has an important talent in the world of
philanthropy: He's good at making money. An investment banker, he
retired seven years ago from Goldman Sachs at age 51. He and Lezlie,
who volunteers two days a week as a child development specialist, now
focus their time on family and their foundation.</TE>
<TE>   To make money, he says, requires focus, to protect money requires
diversification. In an attempt to maximize the effectiveness of their
giving, the Atlases maintain a narrow focus, donating to 15 agencies
in Los Angeles County that serve mental health needs of infants,
toddlers and their families in underserved areas.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Richard Atlas says, he has been tempted to become more
involved in providing a hands-on service like the ones he helps fund,
but he recognizes that in order to help people more effectively, he
must play a different role in the community. "It's better for me to
be out there investing money and earning good returns so I can take
those returns and distribute the money to agencies, so they can more
effectively serve their communities."</TE>
<TE>   "I have more than enough to live the way I want," Atlas says.
"Sometimes I think about selling everything we have and moving into
one of the communities I fund, but then I say, 'It's OK for me to do
this and do that. I don't have to go all the way. I can have
balance.'"</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone who wants to give has money.</TE>
<TE>   Maricruz Diego, who is unemployed, donates her time. Since the
company she worked for moved a year ago, she has spent five days a
week as a volunteer at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband works at a warehouse, so they and their three children
are able to get by, she says. Some days she brings her daughter to
the food bank with her, because she wants her children to learn that
giving is important.</TE>
<TE>   For her efforts, Diego is given one box of food per week. At
church on Sundays, she has nothing to put in the collection plate,
so, instead, she gives a portion of what she receives from the food
bank. The church, in turn, gives the donated food to others in need.</TE>
<TE>   It's sometimes difficult to decide how much to give, how much to
keep. Even though her family has little, she gives as much as she
can.</TE>
<TE>   A study titled "Giving and Volunteering in the United States
2001," conducted by Independent Sector, a coalition of nonprofits,
foundations and corporations addressing issues of philanthropy,
reports that in 2000, 89% of American households donated to charity
and 44% of adults volunteered.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 2000, it is estimated, $203.45 billion was contributed to
nonprofits, according to the American Assn. of Fundraising Counsel.
That marks a 6.6% increase over 1999. Contributions represented 2% of
the nation's Gross Domestic Product. The primary recipients were
religion groups (36.5%), education (13.8%), health (9.3%), human
services (8.8%), arts and culture (5.7%).</TE>
<TE>   Joe Lumarda, executive vice president and acting director of the
California Community Fund, says attitudes toward giving are fluid and
sometimes change from one generation to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have lived through the Depression and New Deal, who
lived through World War II, who went to work for a company and stayed
until retirement, tend to trust large institutions, the United Ways,
Lumarda says. Younger generations tend to give to smaller,
community-based organizations, "where they can see, feel and touch
the impact that their dollars have on the lives of the individuals."</TE>
<TE>   For some, it is important that their giving be as low-profile and
as direct as possible. Among them is a gas station owner in Highland
who has given to friends in need, strangers on street corners, people
with big dreams but little money. Last December, he showed up at a
shelter and took residents Christmas shopping, allowing each to spend
$150 on gifts for themselves and their children.</TE>
<TE>   He says he is not a particularly wealthy man. He owns a half-dozen
gas stations, affording him a nice home, nice car, but few other
excesses. His name, he says, is not important.</TE>
<TE>   What is important is giving, he says. He gave money once to a
family in his church to save its home from foreclosure. When a
musical group had no money to get started, he cut a check for $5,000.
While on business trips, he grabs fruit from the breakfast buffet in
case he sees someone on the street who is hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "When I give a homeless person money, and he goes and buys beer,
that's not my problem," he says. "When I contribute money to my
church, if the pastor takes that money and goes gambling or embezzles
it, that's not my problem. God can deal with that. If I have the
ability to help somebody else, no matter how minuscule the help may
be, then that's what I think I should do."</TE>
<TE>   He gives to his church, although, he says, he is not a great fan
of organized religion. He does not give to organized charities, he
says, because he receives more reward by walking up to a person on
the street and offering him or her a piece of fruit, a sandwich or
money.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Stovall, 82, prefers to give to organizations--his favorite
being the L.A. Mission. From time to time, he stops in and writes out
a check, the last one for $800.</TE>
<TE>   He worked for 20 years as a police officer, going to law school at
night and eventually becoming an insurance lawyer for the state. He
and his wife, Olga, married 64 years, are retired now and focus on
giving back. Their grandchildren sometimes volunteer at the mission
helping to serve food.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me feel that at least I'm trying to do something about
the things we all complain about," he says. "I can't do it all by
myself, but if enough people did it, maybe we could eliminate some of
the problems we have."</TE>
<TE>   Stovall says people sometimes have taken advantage of his
generosity, and he always feels foolish when that happens. It has
taken place on the streets, and it has taken place at church, where,
he says, money he gave was not used as he had intended.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't stop him from giving, he says, but he no longer goes to
church. Instead, he goes downtown to the mission, located in an area
where he walked the beat as a police officer when he was a young man.
It is where, he says, his money and faith are most needed.</TE>
<TE>   The philosopher, the philanthropist, the gas station owner, the
retired lawyer and millions of others have sought their own ways of
giving, have sorted out the ethical dilemmas.</TE>
<TE>   But they are motivated by the same underlying principles.</TE>
<TE>   "There is great need," says Diego, the woman who donates food she
has earned by volunteering. "It gives me great satisfaction that I
can give."</TE>
<TE>   She and the others understand how people all over the world are
suffering, sitting in the ditch, hoping that someone will come along
to help them get back on the road.</TE>

<HD>For Cybercheats, the Affair Is Virtual but Damage Is Real</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PATRICK KAMPERT</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tammy felt sick to her stomach when she saw it. Sitting on the
scanner by the computer were photographs of her husband, Gene.
Pictures he had scanned in himself. One was a picture of Gene and
Tammy dancing at their wedding--except Tammy had been cut out.</LD>
<LD>   She called Gene on his cell phone. He was on the road, traveling
for his New England company.</LD>
<LD>   "I asked him why he had been scanning in pictures of himself,"
Tammy said. "There was a 30-second silence."</LD>
<TE>   "My mother asked for some wedding photos," Gene finally replied.</TE>
<TE>   "You're a liar," Tammy said and hung up.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually the truth would come out. Gene had struck up a
friendship with a woman on the Internet. Although they initially
talked about the news of the day, the talk turned personal. Soon they
were having cybersex, a common Internet practice in which people send
instant messages to each other with details of what they would do to
each other if they were face to face at that moment.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gene and the other woman never met, the cyberspace affair
was just as devastating to Tammy and Gene's marriage as an affair
conducted in a motel room.</TE>
<TE>   "It came pretty darn close to costing me my marriage," Gene said.</TE>
<TE>   Tammy and Gene (who, like others in this story, requested
anonymity) are not alone in finding their lives damaged by Internet
activity related to sex. Last July MSNBC.com released a poll of more
than 38,000 adult Internet users. It found that one in 10 admitted to
being addicted to Internet sex and that one of every seven hours of
Internet usage is devoted to sexual activity.</TE>
<TE>   Through counseling and the support of an Internet message board
for relationships hurt by cybercheating, Tammy and Gene are trying to
gather the fragments of their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that's helped is we read this book called 'After the
Affair' and annotated it," Gene said.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Affair," written by Yale psychologist Janis Abrahms
Spring, has sold 150,000 copies. Although its focus is not the
Internet, Spring said she and other mental-health professionals are
seeing an alarming increase in relationships damaged by Internet
affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I give a workshop, I always ask how many of the
counselors in the room are dealing more and more with affairs that
began on the Internet," she said. "And almost every hand goes up."</TE>
<TE>   J. Lindsey Short, a Houston attorney and president of the American
Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, said he and colleagues across the
country are seeing a "dramatic increase" in divorce cases tangled in
Internet affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people believe it to be safe to have these Internet
discussions," he said. "Over time, they think they know this person,
and from there it's a pretty easy step to pick up the phone and make
a call."</TE>
<TE>   So what drives Internet infidelity? Stanford psychologist Al
Cooper, author of the MSNBC study and a pioneer in the field, calls
it "the Triple-A engine": anonymity, accessibility and affordability.
People can share intimacies without revealing their identities or can
pretend to be someone they're not (anonymity). Instead of a small
sampling of potential partners at a local bar, a person has the
potential to meet thousands of people on the Internet
(accessibility). And the Internet is inexpensive, or certainly more
affordable than face-to-face courtship.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper says the Internet "turbocharges" relationships, speeding
their development as people get a false sense of intimacy with
someone who, a week or month before, had been a complete stranger.</TE>
<TE>   Brian, a teacher and farmer in Kansas, never saw the wreck coming.
And although his wife's affair has not led to divorce, it has led him
to antidepressant medications and feelings that he will never trust
her again.</TE>
<TE>   He and Linda married young; their last anniversary was their 28th.
Right after Christmas 1999 they bought their first computer.</TE>
<TE>   "I can still remember the sound that Windows made when it first
started up," he said. "My wife and I sat there just in awe of it."</TE>
<TE>   Brian, an avid card player, soon discovered that you could talk to
people of similar interests from all over the world, and he began
playing Spades with them. Linda found friends on the Net too, but her
talks had higher stakes.</TE>
<TE>   One night Brian went out to Linda's truck, looking for a
flashlight. Instead he found love letters, printouts of e-mails to
Linda from Glenn, a man she had met online.</TE>
<TE>   But the attraction wasn't confined to the screen. Linda and Glenn
had graduated from e-mails to phone conversations to a motel room.</TE>
<TE>   "He drove 300 miles; she drove 30," Brian said, weeping.</TE>
<TE>   Brian and Linda are still together, but nothing is the same.</TE>
<TE>   "I have known pain, but there is nothing that holds a candle to
this," he said. "It's devastating and I don't think my wife
understands the pain."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the question could be raised: Is Tammy's case the same
as Brian's? After all, one affair was consummated physically; the
other one ended before it reached a face-to-face meeting. But
psychologist Marlene Maheu and family therapist Rona Subotnik,
authors of the book "Infidelity on the Internet," said the damage
they encounter in therapy with their clients is the same.</TE>
<TE>   Subotnik defines "cyberinfidelity" as occurring "when a person
uses a computer or the Internet to betray a vow or agreement of
sexual exclusivity."</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Layton-Tholl, a Florida psychologist who heard from 4,800
people in a study of Internet infidelity, puts it even more simply:
"The minute a relationship goes from being public knowledge to
becoming a secret--the minute you are feeling as though you can't
tell your spouse or partner about this person--you've crossed the
line. It's a betrayal."</TE>
<TE>   But the pursuit of cyber and real-time adultery is not slowing
down. In an ongoing study, Brazilian psychologist Maria Cristina
Martins visits an adult-personals Web site and poses as a Chicago
woman looking for an affair, specifically with a married man in his
40s. In less than a month, she has received more than 1,000
responses--many from executives willing to fly her around the country
and provide accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   While technology is advancing, for better or worse, it can't make
decisions for humans. And when an affair is discovered, the partners
have decisions to make about whether the relationship will continue.</TE>
<TE>   Subotnik said that in successful therapy, the couple goes through
a number of stages: dealing with anger and anxiety, searching for
understanding, and working on communication skills, reconstructing
the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy, she says, but there's hope: "Marriages can get
stronger if they survive an affair because the spouses look at the
problems and build on them."</TE>
<TE>   Laura, a teacher in Texas, certainly found that to be true. Her
husband, Al, had concealed his affair so well that she never
suspected a thing. But when he broke down and confessed it to her, it
forced them as a couple to deal with each other more openly and
honestly than they ever had.</TE>
<TE>   Although the process was agonizing, Laura said their marriage is
better than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "Our feelings are so different for each other now, much stronger,"
she said. "I think to myself: If he would have kept this to himself
for the rest of his life--which he could have--our marriage would
still be just so-so. Strange, isn't it? So much pain to feel so
good."</TE>

<HD>On Their Marks, Get Set, Snow!</HD>
<DH>Preston Springston devotes himself to racing one of
California's top husky teams, which often trains on dirt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MAMMOTH LAKES</DL>
<LD>Tail tucked between her legs, FloJo the sled dog is shaking. She
peeks at the trail in Inyo National Forest. The snow--12 inches deep,
packed tight, on rolling hills--begs for a fast break. The seven
other members of the team unleash a soulful howl:
"Arr-arr-arr-arrrrrr!" Under a late-afternoon sun, after a six-hour
drive from Silver Strand Beach near Oxnard, they strain at tethers
holding them to the bed of a four-wheel-drive truck.</LD>
<LD>   Their cries merge into a strangled yelp of longing for the
unfamiliar thicket of Jeffrey pines ahead: "Owooooo-Owooooo ... " The
dogs' usual training ground is closer to home in Ventura and Los
Angeles counties, where they practice on dirt. Here, at an elevation
of 8,000 feet, in 30-degree weather, seven-eighths of the Seawolf
sprint team is impatient for its first snow workout of the season.</LD>
<LD>   From January to March, more than a dozen sprint competitions take
place on the sled dog racing circuit throughout the West. In tiny
Northern California towns, where schoolchildren wave hand-drawn signs
saying "Go Mushers!," the Seawolves will compete in the speedy
eight-dog, eight-mile division. (The winning team typically runs
under a 4-minute mile.)</LD>
<TE>   For sprint dogs, the key is speed rather than the extreme
endurance required of teams in storied long-distance races such as
the 1,150-mile Iditarod. (The Arctic Challenge, the fictional
competition featured in Disney's "Snow Dogs," is the Hollywood
version of that event.) Preston Springston, 53, knows his Seawolves
aren't the fastest around, but that's OK. The ex-surfer turned musher
says the fun is in hanging out with his dogs in the mountains and
desert, and figuring out how to turn eight independent huskies into
one joyful force.</TE>
<TE>   He is a married father of two, a civil engineer who chuckles at
the foibles of his dogs as if they were his newborns. In 1994, the
year he started out racing, Springston began training four huskies,
including a slacker dog named Blaze, to pull a homemade wooden cart
by the sea. Once, in the middle of a run, Blaze laid down on the
trail and put his paws in the air to signal that he was calling it a
day.</TE>
<TE>   This season, Springston sees the way his team is hunkering down on
the trail in classic sled dog form: heads down, tails down, shoulders
hunched. On their weekend in Mammoth, the noisy Alaskan and Siberian
huskies leap with anticipation while Springston slips a harness
around each one. FloJo, the team's newest member, ducks under the
Toyota truck. She is a skinny Alaskan husky-hound mix, which means
that, unlike the other dogs, she has ears that flop down. This is her
first trip away from home.</TE>
<TE>   Springston grabs FloJo and hooks her harness into the gang line--a
stretchy cord that connects the dogs, two by two, to the rest of the
team. In a snowsuit, snow boots and billed fleece cap, Springston
positions himself on the sled's rear runners. He grins at the sight
of all eight lunging, barking dogs. "FloJo's all into it now," he
notes.</TE>
<TE>   Springston reaches down and pops the snow hook, an anchor that
secures the dogs to the ground. "Readyyyyyyy, go!" he shouts. The
dogs shoot off straight and true. They fly over a mogul and disappear
around a shady bend.</TE>
<TE>   The team is silent now. Heads down, tails down, shoulders hunched.</TE>
<TE>   California Mushers Use Open Spaces, Trails</TE>
<TE>   Throughout California, mushers practice on any long, wide stretch
of land such as a vineyard, an orchard or railroad tracks, places
with a minimum of loose dogs or other distractions, says Charlene
LaBelle, treasurer of the Sierra Nevada Dog Drivers Assn. The group
has about 100 members in California and Nevada, in cities like San
Jose and towns such as Los Gatos in the Silicon Valley. A few mushers
live in Southern California, mostly in the high desert. In the
winter, sprint drivers head to snowfields for speed workouts and
practice in handling turns in powder and ice; mushers like Springston
are stuck on dirt trails in the desert until they can make it to a
place like Mammoth on a weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "People are blown away that these [mushers] in California run
dogs," LaBelle says. "We really blow them away when we win." In fact,
California has produced a couple of world-class mushers such as
international gold medalist Ralph Whitten of Truckee, a sprint team
driver.</TE>
<TE>   Mushers in the state gravitate toward sprints, which require as
few as two dogs and wrap up in a weekend. By contrast, on March 2,
Iditarod teams of 12 to 16 dogs will begin trekking across the
Alaskan wilderness for up to 17 days in long hours of darkness.</TE>
<TE>   The Iditarod champion takes home $68,571 of a $600,000 purse. In
California's races, prize money typically totals $3,000, which is
divided among the top finishers in six categories. If you have a good
year, your winnings might put a dent in the dog food bills.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Seawolves--the state's No. 1 team in its
division-- won a total of $600, which almost covered Springston's gas
expenses. Actually, Springston acknowledges, his team is on top
because of a quirk in the ratings system determined by the
International Sled Dog Racing Assn., which tracks 2,234 mushers
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Springston likes to compete close to home, so the Seawolves run
more races in California-- than other top teams that actually beat
them to the finish line by, oh, 20 minutes or so. But even coming in
a late second or third moves them up in the overall rankings. The
point isn't for Springston's team to lead the pack. "This whole thing
is a big adventure," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Training runs are ripe for the unexpected. Sometimes, Springston
will fall off the sled, holding on with one arm, and slide on his
knees for several yards in snow. Sometimes, he'll be upright on the
sled, at 6 foot 3, 215 pounds--about 50 pounds heavier than the
average sprint musher--and the dogs will send him airborne on a
downhill stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Siberian Husky With a Behavior Problem</TE>
<TE>   Springston grew up in Virginia Beach, Va., with dogs, and so did
his kids in Silver Strand Beach. In 1992, after the family's obedient
little spaniel-shepherd died of old age, Springston headed to the
pound. He picked out a quiet Siberian husky, Czar, who had a behavior
problem. Czar spent three years in obedience school, where Springston
learned how to work with dogs. And he learned what made Czar tick.</TE>
<TE>   If Czar got loose, he would run forever. So on weekends,
Springston began taking Czar to Mt. Pinos near Frazier Park and let
the dog pull him on cross-country skis.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Springston acquired two more huskies. One day, on the
beach, he met someone who was walking a Siberian husky named Sheeba
and asked to borrow her. He began training the four dogs at Oxnard
Shores, while keeping his eyes open for other huskies. Eventually, he
cobbled together a team that he ran for five years. But the loaner
dogs sometimes moved away.</TE>
<TE>   Springston began acquiring more huskies of his own and had to
start housing them in a nearby training kennel. Two of the dogs,
Katya and Bandit, live in his backyard, where they romp and wrestle
and hunt rabbits.</TE>
<TE>   Now he owns all of the Seawolves except timid FloJo, whom he
borrows from another musher. FloJo, 8, is built for speed, slim and
muscular, with long, lean legs. She has run with other teams,
sometimes as the lead dog. But when she joined the Seawolves in the
fall, Springston couldn't get her to walk from her owner's trailers
to his, 20 feet away. Springston didn't mind the three or four visits
he made before FloJo finally stopped slinking to the ground. These
days, she is turning into "a little professional" for the Seawolves.</TE>
<TE>   "I like working with the dogs," Springston says. "It's real cool
when they're all trained, and all those little sets of ears are all
perked, and they're all listening to you. A good, clean run, everyone
working--it's a real good feeling."</TE>
<TE>   In practices this season, Springston is running the rambunctious
Harley as lead dog. Harley is a big, strong 4-year-old with one blue
eye and one brown. (Harley and his energetic partner, Niki, make up
half of the team's strength, but power isn't everything. ... Last
year, as a rookie, Harley learned only the command "Let's Go!" and
ignored nine or so others such as "Gee" for turn right or "Haw," for
turn left.</TE>
<TE>   But Harley is showing potential. He finally broke the habit of
spinning in circles and tangling his harness. Harley hates to see
other teams ahead of him. If he gets a lock on one, Springston says,
"he's going to dig and pull and bust his butt until he catches up."</TE>
<TE>   "It's really easy to chase the furry butt that's in front of you,"
Springston says. "But to be up in front, with everyone else behind
you? It takes a lot of confidence to keep going in a straight path
down the trail. It takes a lot of concentration and dedication. Not
too many dogs can do it."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, his lead dogs have done him proud. Two
seasons ago, at a race in Markleeville, now-retired lead dog Jackie
steered the team through a blizzard and 30 mph winds across an open
meadow. Eight inches of powder blitzed across the trail, which
Springston could no longer see. An impatient lead dog would have
tried to cut across the meadow, off trail, and paralyze the team in 4
feet of snow. Nose to the ground, Jackie never veered off the path.</TE>
<TE>   What he loves about his dogs, Springston says, is that they have
the heart to run.</TE>
<TE>   The Dogs Train by Pulling Tires</TE>
<TE>   Training starts with summer runs on a 1.5-acre field at the dogs'
kennel in Somis, north of Camarillo. Springston works with the dogs
individually, running them on a mountain bike or coaching them to
pull tires. In late October, the team begins training in the local
mountains and in the high desert, at elevations ranging from 3,000 to
5,000 feet. (Springston and the dogs must get used to race
conditions, which means cold, snow and altitude; in warm, humid air,
the dogs can overheat in their thick coats.)</TE>
<TE>   On dirt trails, Springston says, the goal is to work on the dogs'
strength and conditioning--the Seawolves pull him on a 125-pound
wheeled cart--and then wait for the first major snowfall in Mammoth.
In deep snow, the focus switches to speed training with a 25-pound
sled. The workouts are for Springston, too, who practices shifting
his weight on turns in the snow and jumps off the sled to help the
dogs on tough uphill climbs.</TE>
<TE>   On this afternoon, the dogs trot back to the parking lot after
their six-mile run near Mammoth's Lookout Mountain. Bits of ice stick
to their fur, and their breath clouds the air. (After tough races,
icicles of drool drip from their muzzles.) Springston and his
25-year-old son, Adam Springston, tether the dogs back to the truck.</TE>
<TE>   Springston kneels, with a kind word and caress for each one. He
checks their paws while Adam hands out uncooked wieners as appetizers
before a dinner of hot kibble mixed with fatty hamburger and rice.
Sitkin, a Siberian husky, has a tiny cut on a front paw from a shard
of ice or rock but isn't in pain. Otherwise, Springston is happy with
the run. The dogs don't nip at one another as they used to, and none
of them stops very often to sniff a pine. A single straying dog would
mean a huge tangled mess because the sled doesn't stop immediately.
"The thing I really like about the team," Springston says, "is that
each dog has got a good work ethic. When they're in the harness,
nobody's fooling around."</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, in a 40-degree heat wave, Springston slips black
nylon booties on Sitkin's front paws. Harness time. Again, the dogs
go crazy. Again, FloJo's tail droops.</TE>
<TE>   More frantic cries, and within a few minutes, the dogs are in
position; Harley and Niki, his usual partner, are at the lead. Again,
the dogs fall silent at takeoff, and the sled rumbles over the
snow--this time, with an unexpected load of 100 pounds and change. An
extra passenger is on board, in the sled's basket. Harley reacts
immediately; his part of the gang line goes slack. "Harley, let's
go!" Springston says and repeats himself twice. Harley glances back
then forges ahead. "G'dog, Harley! Hurry up, [Sitkin]! Let's go,
Mish! That's a boy."</TE>
<TE>   Springston's directions are firm but not sharp. The dogs pick up
speed. The wind whizzes by; pebbles of ice pelt the dogs. The sled
skids, flies and bumps. Five minutes later, Springston calls "Whoa!"
and the dogs stop to let the extra passenger off. Then they rush off
to finish the nine-mile loop--three miles longer than their usual
workout--on a trail that includes a steep run up and down the
backside of the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty minutes later, the Seawolves return. You hear them first,
panting through the trees. Then you see them, their tongues hanging
low, still holding strong. There's Sitkin, with only one bootie; he
will lose the other bootie by the end of the run. There's Niki, in
front, 70 pounds and movie-star handsome. And loping next to Niki,
looking like a little kid, is a new lead dog: 48-pound FloJo.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, Harley never recovered from the shock of the
temporary passenger. He was distracted, looking around on the trail.
So Springston decided to try FloJo as lead. Harley settled down in
FloJo's old spot, two rows back. And FloJo? "She did a great job,"
Springston says. For instance, "a squirrel passed the trail and went
on high. If Harley was in lead, we would be up that hill. FloJo took
us right on by."</TE>
<TE>   "In the movies," he says, "they make you believe the lead dog is
the dominant dog. That's not necessarily the truth. ... It's more who
doesn't worry about the other dogs behind them."</TE>
<TE>   The team probably will fit in one more snow camping trip before
its first race on Feb. 9 in Chester (population: 2,300), east of
Redding. Springston won't pencil in the dogs' positions until he can
assess the trail's condition and the other teams on race day. For
now, though, the dog he sees up front is the newcomer,
steady-as-she-goes FloJo.</TE>

<LD>The stories alone could break your heart.</LD>
<LD>   An adolescence spent in a sanitarium, recovering from
tuberculosis. A mother's mental illness forcing a Depression-era
stint in an abusive foster home. The death of an alcoholic father. A
childhood spent trying to outrun the Nazis.</LD>
<LD>   But it is in the sharing--the writing down and passing along--that
they become instruments not of pain, but of pride, convincing us not
of life's cruelty, but of the human spirit's capacity for resilience
and recovery.</LD>
<TE>   They come lugging folders and spiral notebooks, crammed with
hundreds of years of collective memories. For two hours every
Tuesday, the 20 elderly men and women swap stories and pick up
writing tips in the "Life Stories" class at this Reseda senior
center.</TE>
<TE>   Teacher Jeanette Shelburne begins by passing out a leaflet
extolling the value of incorporating thoughts and feelings. "'I am
nervous. I am sad. I am excited' are the kinds of feelings that will
make a story more interesting," the handout says. Today's session
will have all of that.</TE>
<TE>   Shelburne asks who wants to read, and hands shoot up around the
table. She tries to keep the group on task. After each reading,
classmates are asked to comment on the quality of the literary
effort. Was there enough dialogue? Too much description? Could you
feel the characters, see the action?</TE>
<TE>   Although class rules limit each story to two pages, no one objects
when Jack reads his five-page, single-spaced tale of his Aunt Jane's
disastrous attempt to have her picture taken with Jimmy Durante, who
lived near their home in Beverly Hills. They chortle over his Durante
imitation and applaud heartily when he ends.</TE>
<TE>   Shelburne has been encouraging her students to be more disciplined
writers and more critical of one another. "Do you think maybe he
played with words too much?" she asks "Did the story move a little
slow at times?"</TE>
<TE>   But the dynamics of the class work against her efforts. "I thought
it was very interesting," Shelly insists. Bill nods in assent.
"Sometimes my mind wandered," he admits, "but then he'd say something
that brought it back."</TE>
<TE>   Group members tend to be "really protective and supportive of each
other," says Shelburne. So when Bill finishes his story about his
final day with his dying father and wonders aloud if maybe it didn't
"bog down in places," Shelburne hardly gets a chance to speak before
his classmates intervene: "No, no, it was wonderful," says one woman,
while the others nod vigorously. "I thought it was very well
written," agrees another. She reaches over to pat Bill's hand. "And
I'm so glad you got to be with your father."</TE>
<TE>   So much for Shelburne's gentle admonishment that the class stick
to a story's literary merits "and not go on and on about what this
reminds us of in our lives." After all, what draws these people here
is a chance to connect the dots, not just in their lives but in the
lives of others who share the touchstones of their generation.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them haven't talked about this stuff before," Shelburne
said. "They don't think their kids are interested. I tell them, 'They
might not be interested now, when they're preoccupied with their own
kids and marriages and careers, but think about how valuable this
will be to them when they're the age that you are now.'"</TE>
<TE>   Shelburne has been teaching the class for one year, though many of
the seniors have been coming for much longer. It meets at the ONE
Senior Center and is funded by the Los Angeles Unified school
system's adult education division.</TE>
<TE>   Similar classes are popular at senior citizen centers and
community colleges across Southern California and around the country.
Few of the participants actually publish their work, but there have
been spectacular exceptions. Five years ago, a 98-year-old Kansas
woman sold her memoir, "The Life of Jessie Lee Brown From Birth up to
80 Years," for $1 million. The 208-page manuscript was an assignment
in a senior writing class.</TE>
<TE>   But most come for the camaraderie, the opportunity for
introspection, the chance to be in the spotlight, if only for a few
moments. "Certain kinds of life transitions have question marks
attached to them, like 'How did I end up here?'" explains Donna
Deutchman, executive director of the senior center and co-author of
the 1992 book "Guiding Autobiography Groups for Older Adults." The
classes "help give their lives a new sense of meaning at a time their
self-esteem may be beginning to wane. "</TE>
<TE>   For many, the weekly sessions are like therapy. "People get in
here and talk about things they've pent up for years, stuff they
thought they were the only ones going through. And they find that
everybody has similar struggles and failures and pain. It becomes a
place where you learn to understand, to forgive yourself," Deutchman
says. "You watch seniors come to a discovery ... to look back through
their lives and realize all that they've been through, and what a
major accomplishment they've achieved simply by still being here."</TE>
<TE>   Some spend hours each week, scrawling their most private thoughts
in longhand, page after page. Others record theirs on computers,
complete with digitalized pictures to pass around. Many read aloud
haltingly, hobbled by poor eyesight or unfamiliarity with English.
Some hands shake as they hold their papers. A microphone amplifies
their voices, because many are losing their hearing.</TE>
<TE>   For some, it is the first time they have shared painful secrets.
And Shelburne never fails to be amazed by their considerable lack of
self-pity. "They don't pretend the bad things didn't happen," she
says. "But they've all found something within themselves to see the
glass of their life as half full."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, even the saddest of this day's stories tend to be laced
with subtle humor, searching questions or wry observations. And the
readings unleash tales--yet unwritten--from classmates around the
table, of handicapped children, failed marriages, guilt over the
death of a sibling.</TE>
<TE>   They commiserate, but only briefly. "Life is a gamble," Henry
concludes. "A joke. On us." His classmates laugh. And the next writer
takes the microphone. There are still many more stories left to tell.</TE>

<LD>Had the dean of Harvard Law School not urged one of his second-year
students to switch to a more practical career, such as songwriting,
Broadway might never have had Cole Porter.</LD>
<LD>   Although the segue from torts to Tin Pan Alley did not have an
auspicious beginning, (his first show, "See America First," in 1916
was a flop), Porter went on to become one of the most successful and
prolific composers of the American musical theater.</LD>
<LD>   His words and music were celebrated Monday in "Another Op'nin',
Another Show" at the annual Salon at the Taper, sponsored by members
of Inner Circle, major supporters of Center Theatre Group. Salon,
underwritten by Audrey and Charles Kenis, is a perk for belonging to
Inner Circle, an annual membership program for donors of $2,500 or
more.</LD>
<TE>   This year more than $80,000 was generated from new membership, and
an additional $35,000 was raised in single-ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   This was the best Salon ever. Of course, we've been saying that
every year since Michael Feinstein launched the annual tribute to
American songsmiths 10 years ago. But there was something magical
about this one. And it was more than just the music. Maybe it was the
mood of the crowd on both sides of the footlights. Producer Susan
Clines, director Gordon Hunt and conductor Peter Matz deserve credit
for combining talents in new ways. Kevin Earley, Klea Blackhurst,
Bets Malone, Valarie Pettiford and Hugh Panaro put their own spin on
vintage Porter. Patricia Morison, the original "Kate" of "Kiss Me,
Kate," Elizabeth Ward Land, Raymond Del Barrio, Susanne Blakeslee,
David Hyde Pierce, L.A. Opera's Suzanna Guzman, chanteuse Wesla
Whitfield and Curly Jim Musgrave (a singing cowboy from Calgary) also
sang Porter songs.</TE>
<TE>   In the audience were former stars of Porter shows: Anna Maria
Alberghetti, Nanette Fabray, Betty Garrett, choreographer Michael
Kidd, Fayard Nicholas and Janis Paige.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been involved with CTG and the Salon for more than a dozen
years, but the great thing about Cole Porter is that everyone knows
his lyrics," said Chuck Fries, who co-chaired the event with his
wife, Ava. "My mother used to play his tunes on the piano. I can
still sing all the words to 'Don't Fence Me In.'"</TE>
<TE>   Following a standing ovation, the crowd strolled across the plaza
to the Grand Hall of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for Cafe Cole, a
late-night supper party with the cast, where Todd Schroeder presided
over the piano bar. There, an assortment of wannabe saloon singers
joined some cast members for a reprise. Among them was one
high-profile socialite, who performed a pretty fair impersonation of
Martha Graham doing "Steamroller Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Spotted among the night owls were Julie and Richard Kagan, Martin
Massman, Betsy and Harold Applebaum, Anne and Kirk Douglas, Rosemary
and Robert Stack, Nancy and Alan Livingston, Georgianna and Richard
Thomas, Ron Arnault, Judith and Thomas Beckmen, Joan and Allan Burns,
Sheri and Les Biller, Barbara and Peter Fodor, Judi and Gordon

<TE>   Steppenwolf Benefit</TE>
<TE>   The Steppenwolf Theatre Company of Chicago, the longest surviving
acting ensemble in America, staged its first major West Coast
fund-raiser at Hollywood &amp; Highland, with the directorial debut of
one of its star members, John Malkovich. "The Dancer Upstairs"--a
Grand Guignol thriller based on Nicholas Shakespeare's novel, which
spews more blood than the goriest of Freddy Krueger flicks--had its
first local screening at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. A posh supper
followed the event held Jan. 24 at the Highlands, Wolfgang Puck's
newest venue in the complex.</TE>
<TE>   First-nighters were greeted by a swarm of paparazzi along with
all-you-can-down popcorn and sodas, courtesy of Target Stores, the
evening's sponsor. The event raised $250,000 for Steppenwolf.</TE>
<TE>   In the crowd were Gary Sinise and Jeff Perry, who co-founded
Steppenwolf with Terry Kinney in 1975, shortly after they graduated
from Highland Park High School in suburban Chicago. A year later,
they expanded the group to include Illinois State University friends,
H.E. Baccus, Nancy Evans, Moira Harris and Malkovich, and launched
their first series of one-act plays in a church school basement.</TE>
<TE>   After moving to new digs in Chicago and enlarging the ensemble
with the addition of Joan Allen, Francis Guinan, Glenne Headly, Tom
Irwin, John Mahoney and Rondi Reed, the company won a Tony Award for
Regional Theater Excellence in 1985. In 1990, Steppenwolf opened its
production of "Grapes of Wrath" on Broadway and took home Tonys for
best play and best director. In 1998, it became the first theater
troupe to receive the National Medal of Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Before the film rolled, Malkovich glowered at his old pal, Sinise,
and publicly chastised him for not wearing a sarong to the opening.
Later, at the party, Malkovich explained, "I keep telling Gary what
to wear. I'd like him to dress and do what I want him to do. He'd
make a great Hedy Lamarr. But, he never wants to do what I want. He
always does what he wants to do. I've had that problem with other
actors, but, it really bothers me with him." Shaking his head in
utter dismay, Sinise said, "John enjoys unsettling me."</TE>
<TE>   Others on the scene were the film's star, Javier Bardem,
co-producers Russ Smith and Lianne Halfon, and Steppenwolf execs
Michael Gennaro, Martha Lavey and Judith Simons. Also there: David
Schwimmer, Moira Harris, Laurie Metcalf, Gary Cole, Joey Slotnick,
Mark Ruffalo, Andy Garcia, Diane Goldberg, George Joseph, Gigi
Pritzker, John Ratner, Merle Reskin, Bruce Sagan, Bob Berenson,
Debbie and Larry Brady, and Anne and Noel Gimbel.</TE>

<TE>   Showcase Preview</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Pasadena Showcase House for the Arts staged their
annual Empty House Party on Jan. 25 for the patrons, designers and
craftsmen, who will embark on the Cinderella treatment of this year's
home, a historic residence called "Overlook," designed by architect
Reginald Johnson that sits on 51/2 acres atop a tree-covered hill in
Altadena.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1915 for two widows, the Mediterranean-style mansion was
expanded in 1925 to more than 12,000 square feet by a subsequent
owner. The present owners, who have moved out for the duration of the
three-month face-lift, claim that the swimming hole on the estate is
one of the first private pools built in the Southland. Now in serious
disrepair, it's about to be transformed into an exotic lily pond.</TE>
<TE>   This year's other innovations include a putting green and an
oversize chessboard in the garden.</TE>
<TE>   Vicki McCluggage is chairing the benefit, which opens to the
public April 21. Proceeds from the monthlong event, one of the oldest
and largest home tours in America, are earmarked for children's music
education programs, an instrumental competition for young adults and
the L.A. Philharmonic.</TE>

how people of all races have dinner together. I would take him to my

make a difference in America.</LD>

he wrote his songs.</TE>

<LD>"The Tale of Peter Rabbit"</LD>
<LD>   by Beatrix Potter</LD>
<LD>   Mother Rabbit told Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter Rabbit not
to go to Mr. McGregor's garden. But Peter Rabbit didn't listen. He
got into Mr. McGregor's garden. He ate his plants. He got chased by
Mr. McGregor. He almost got caught. Read the book to find out how he

<TE>   "Hey! Get Off Our Train"</TE>
<TE>   by John Burningham</TE>
<TE>   The book is about a little boy who is playing with his train set,
and his mother tells him to go to bed because he has to get up early
for school. When he goes to sleep, he dreams about an adventure on a
train with his stuffed dog. Along the way, he has experiences with
several animals that want to get on the train. The animals carry an
important message as to why they want to get on the train. This book
is very powerful. Read it to find out why!</TE>

<TE>   "The Ant and the Elephant"</TE>
<TE>   by Bill Peet</TE>
<TE>   The elephant helped a lot of animals and was pleased with himself
for all the good deeds he had done. When he wasn't paying attention,
he fell in a big hole that was covered with grass. He cried for help.
Will anyone help him? Read the book.</TE>

<TE>   "Broadway Chicken"</TE>
<TE>   by Jean-Luc Fromental</TE>
<TE>   Charlie the Chicken is a singer and a dancer. He was an unusual
performer in New York on Broadway. Charlie lived in a booth, and when
people put money in a little slot, feed would come down for Charlie
and he would dance.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Z. Fowler bought Charlie thinking he could earn money.
Samuel put Charlie in movies, and Charlie became famous. But then
Charlie had surgery for a limp. When Sam found out, he didn't want to
own Charlie anymore. Find out if Charlie gets to live happily ever
after by reading the book.</TE>
<TE>   I liked this book because it was funny and exciting. I thought
Charlie was neat in the story because he was a chicken on Broadway.
This is an excellent book to recommend to anyone.</TE>

<LD>"There's a new book I think you'd like, Becca," Grammie said. Grammie
has lots of neat books, for grown-ups and for kids, but she'll always
buy more.</LD>
<LD>   We drove to the Great Big Store of Books. They had pop-up books,
books that came with toys, and books about TV stars, but we couldn't
find the book Grammie wanted.</LD>
<LD>   "Do you have 'Dylan, Dynamic Dragon of Dunsimore'?" Grammie asked
the clerk.</LD>
<TE>   "Huh?" The clerk scratched her head.</TE>
<TE>   "It has wonderful words and beautiful pictures in it," Grammie
explained.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, if you don't see it, I guess not," the clerk said.</TE>
<TE>   We had better luck at Book-O-Rama.</TE>
<TE>   "I can special-order this book for you," the man there said.
"You'll have it next week."</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you for getting me a new book," I told Grammie on the way
home. "That man was helpful."</TE>
<TE>   "You bet," she answered. "He reminded me of Mr. Pick, who had a
wonderful bookshop years ago. It was small and crowded and dusty, but
the sign said, 'Any book mentioned anywhere.' And just like the man
at Book-O-Rama, he'd order whatever you wanted."</TE>
<TE>   "Grammie, I just remembered that my baby-sitter, Trish, told me
about another way to order books--online."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I don't know anything about computers," Grammie said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I do," I told her. "Let's give it a try."</TE>
<TE>   At home, we found the Web site on my computer and typed in the
title of the book. It popped up on the screen in color.</TE>
<TE>   "This is almost as great as Mr. Pick's bookshop," Grammie said.
"Looks like I'll have to get a computer."</TE>
<TE>   Grammie ordered three more books for me and two for herself.</TE>
<TE>   "Grammie," I asked. "What do you think Mr. Pick would say about
this new kind of bookshop?"</TE>
<TE>   "He'd probably say there's a place for both," Grammie said and
hugged me.</TE>

Mr. Pick's Bookshop in San Bernardino.</TE>

<LD>Given the ubiquity of Charles "Sparky" Schulz's "Peanuts," it is hard
to remember that the strip was in many ways a highly unlikely success
story. The protagonist Charlie Brown is a loser whose obstreperous
ego makes it difficult to root for him, even when he suffers shocking
abuse at the hands of the ruthless tykes who populate his nameless
American neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   His neighbors Lucy and Linus Van Pelt are classically maladjusted
children; she a budding sadist who enjoys humiliating the
round-headed Brown on a regular basis, both on the football field and
in her makeshift psychiatric office, where she doles out therapeutic
advice of a peculiarly dubious kind to him and other unsuspecting
patients; he a thumb-sucking blanket-carrying junior Christian mystic
with a belief in a mysterious entity called the "Great Pumpkin" who
ostensibly rises over random pumpkin patches each Halloween to
dispense gifts to sincere children the world over. Lucy's love
interest, the dinky maestro Schroeder, piously plays only Beethoven
on his toy piano and has no sense of humor whatsoever, while Brown's
dog Snoopy unaccountably fancies himself a World War I pilot locked
in endless battle with Germany's Red Baron despite the fact that he
is barely energetic enough to raise his canine carcass from the roof
of his doghouse. From such humble materials are legendary comic
empires made.</LD>
<TE>   "Peanuts: The Art of Charles M. Schulz" collects more than 500 of
Schulz's strips and offers a lovely introduction to the most
influential daily comic strip of the 20th century. Designed and
edited by graphic designer Chip Kidd, the book features beautiful
photographs of original artwork and vintage newsprint and thereby
manages to capture the texture of Schulz's comic art in all its daily
Benday dot glory. The volume also contains enchanting images of
collectible "Peanuts" memorabilia, including dolls fabricated in 1958
by the Hungerford Plastics Corp., a series of tableaux for the
Viewmaster stereoscope from 1966 and the "Peanuts" board game by
Selchow &amp; Richter from 1967. An exercise in nostalgia, the book is
all the more poignant given Schulz's passing on Feb. 12, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   From the earliest strips, many of the hallmarks of "Peanuts"'
minimalist style are amply in evidence. Schulz's line is simple, his
compositions are uncluttered and each four-panel daily strip sets up
a gag that pays off richly in the final panel. Each character has a
carefully delineated psychology and, in the best tradition of the
American situation comedy, the series features little or no character
development over time, as each member of the "Peanuts" gang is a kind
of archetype expertly deployed by Schulz in his staggeringly
inventive mini-narratives.</TE>
<TE>   It is fascinating to watch Schulz get to know his characters as he
invents them and then trots them out to see what mischief they have
to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Though Charlie Brown, ostensibly modeled on Schulz himself, is the
series' protagonist, he is less hero than anti-hero, a kind of screen
onto whom the strip's various figures pour out their apparently
endless aggression. In the very early strips ("Peanuts" started Oct.
2, 1950), Violet and Patty are the central female figures, mainly
concerned with the fabrication of mud pies and the regular
belittlement of Charlie Brown. Along the way, Schulz invents
ancillary characters such as the filthy Pigpen, but when these
figures run their course he is all too happy to dispense with them.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy makes her appearance in 1953 as a rather sweet, wide-eyed
baby whom Charlie Brown takes care of, though it would not be long
before Lucy would be regularly taking care of Charlie Brown. Despite
Schulz's distaste for his heroine, Lucy is the strip's dark comic
engine, just as her brother Linus is its comforting transcendental
philosopher. Of Lucy, Schulz once remarked: "She represents all of
the cold-blooded, self-sufficient people in the world who do not feel
that it is at all necessary ever to say anything kind about anyone."
Then again, kindness is never funny, as Schulz knew all too well.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the '50s, the decade of "Leave It to Beaver"
and "Father Knows Best," Schulz had already cottoned to the fact that
the lives of American children are filled with quiet malevolence and
that adults have little clue about the affective existence of the
little folks who share their homes for the first two decades of their
lives. Thoroughly eradicating any adult presence from the world of
"Peanuts", Schulz allows the monstrous ids and egos of these children
free reign, and the results are not pretty.</TE>
<TE>   This is the secret appeal of "Peanuts": Despite Hallmark Corp.'s
attempt to hijack the strip for its saccharine greeting cards,
despite the innumerable "Happiness is ..." T-shirts sold in '70s gift
shops, Schulz's world is decidedly unsentimental, and his vision of
childhood is finally a lot darker than it has been thought to be.
While the strip's language and subject matter are never vulgar, it is
not as far as it first appears from the world of "Peanuts" to the
worlds of "The Simpsons" and "South Park."</TE>
<TE>   Above all, it is the variety of Schulz's invention that proves
most astonishing, for although the strip's energy did flag somewhat
during its last decade, Schulz managed to produce "Peanuts" daily for
fully 50 years, concocting wonderfully comic gags and gambits every
week. Whether it is Linus worrying about his beloved teacher Miss
Othmar's mental condition as his class makes eggshell "igli" ("one
igloo, two igli," he informs a befuddled Charlie Brown) or Lucy
explaining the plot of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Pit and the Pendulum"
to her brother with the aid of Charlie Brown, who hangs upside-down
in a tangle from the kite-eating tree or the neighborhood baseball
team assembling mid-game on the pitching mound to discuss the
implications of the story of Job, Schulz and the "Peanuts" gang charm
the reader with their manifold eccentricities. A great artist in a
humble medium, Charles Schulz opened new vistas, not just for the
daily comic strip but for our understanding of childhood.</TE>

<DH>I'LL LET YOU GO, A Novel, By Bruce Wagner, Villard: 552
pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY INDIANA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Without knowing anything about Bruce Wagner, the casual reader of his
three novels to date, "Force Majeure," "I'm Losing You" and now,
weighing in at a page count only a few hundred shy of "The Brothers
Karamazov," "I'll Let You Go," would surmise that the author works
primarily as a screenwriter in Hollywood; that his core audience is a
claque of Hollywood people who think he's the cat's pajamas; that he
has a more diffuse audience of fans who write landfill for men's
magazines and who would like to become Hollywood screenwriters; that
Wagner's relationships in the movie business are so determining of
how he constructs a novel that even a book with little direct bearing
on Hollywood reads like an artificially prose-enriched screenplay in
which actual Hollywood figures that Wagner approves of, like Diane
Keaton and Gus Van Sant, appear as fawned-over walk-on characters
while other real people from movie-land whom Wagner dislikes or views
as his overrated competition are periodically slagged by his
fictional characters. Robert Towne, for example, is invariably
referred to, disparagingly, as Robert Chinatowne.</LD>
<TE>   Wagner's longueurs of fawning and sniping might be considered
minor irritants in a more blatantly malicious novel like "I'm Losing
You," which tried to engage the shopworn theme of Hollywood
soul-murder in a brisk, peripatetic way and occasionally succeeded.
("Force Majeure" made the telling mistake of using an unsuccessful
screenwriter as a protagonist and reads like a piercing whine from
the gilded bowels of a not-especially punishing hell.)</TE>
<TE>   In "I'll Let You Go," a smarmy, lumbering, sentimental yet
strikingly gelid novel pretending to be a bighearted, empathetic
picaresque of human folly, these bits of apparently irresistible
inside-the-circus-tent jeering and breech-kissing are, in the lingo
of Minsky's, real showstoppers, spinning the reader's mind away from
the question "Why am I reading this?" which hovers between eye and
page throughout most of this book to the even more disturbing one,
"Why is he writing this?"</TE>
<TE>   Only a reviewer has a ready-made answer to the first question, and
even a reviewer with a much larger capacity for tripe than my own
would find the first 40 or 50 pages of "I'll Let You Go" unbearably
mannered, precious, condescending and fake in every conceivable way.
Every setting resembles the maquette of a theater proscenium instead
of the real world; the actors who pirouette across Wagner's various
toy stages have the verisimilitude of marionettes.</TE>
<TE>   This book, briefly, is about a family, the Trotters, rich beyond
mortal dreams and exampled by three generations of deeply troubled
compulsive shoppers; an African American waif, Amaryllis, and her
dark journey through homelessness and the foster care system; and a
former William Morris agent, married 20 years earlier, and still
technically married, to a scioness of the Trotter family. He had a
schizophrenic breakdown on their wedding night and disappeared,
reincarnating himself in the twilight world of shelters and skid rows
as the original, i.e., Pre-Raphaelite, William Morris, a burly and
wild-mouthed but gentle giant of a man who befriends Amaryllis and
tries to protect her from the ghastly world of Children's Services,
as do three unutterably precocious Trotter children, Toulouse (also
called Tull, child of scioness and mad agent), and his cousins Edward
and Lucy, who meet her during their visit to a downtown film set
where their friend, a child star named Boulder, is shooting a movie.</TE>
<TE>   After constructing an elaborate, cumbersome narrative apparatus
that allows him to cut back and forth between the manias and madcap
whimsies of the Trotter clan (whose limitless expenditures and
capriciously grandiose acquisitions Wagner catalogs in adoringly
fetishistic detail), the contrastingly hairy perils of Amaryllis and
the mock-Victorian odyssey of William Morris, Wagner has also given
most of his connect-the-dots plot away.</TE>
<TE>   What remains is several hundred pages in which coincidence,
near-encounters and other filmic devices for contriving suspense
compete with chunks of arcane research, stuffed into the narrative
like chestnuts into a Christmas goose, concerning all manner of
rarefied subjects, from mortuary architecture to garden lore to the
chemistry of anti-psychotic drugs to secrets of the confectioner's
art. The last is so central to this book's notion of a leitmotif that
it leaves a thin coating of powdered sugar on virtually every scene,
even the ones splattered with vomit and excrement.</TE>
<TE>   The Trotters are forever tucking into expanses of richly inventive
pastry and other breathtaking food; Amaryllis' few happy moments,
during much of her torment, are gustatory in nature. The long-missing
husband with delusions of grandeur comes from a somewhat depressingly
middle-class Jewish family of dessert makers and the manufacture of
very special goodies featuring pomegranates as the key ingredient is
the fingerprint he leaves wherever his delusional rovings allow him
to come temporarily to rest.</TE>
<TE>   We know within a few excruciating chapters that the facially
disfigured and in other ways handicapped Edward will eventually die,
that the schizophrenic agent and his abandoned bride Katrina will be
reunited after a lot of push-pull and that the waif will find a good
home, and even marry a billionaire, by the whimpering, autumnal
conclusion of this seemingly endless saga; what most of the secondary
figures do is equally predictable, at least in the sense that
habitual modes of extravagance and unreality define these characters
as carefully charted plot points rather than as actual human beings.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't help that "I'll Let You Go" is written in the florid
manner of a bodice-ripper aping Dickens, a style that foreshadows
every twist and turn from a considerable distance (at exhaustive,
exhausting length, replete with asides and footnotes suggesting how
we should feel about what we're reading and letting us know that only
the "cynical" reader could find it preposterous) so that by the time
something happens (when William, for instance, is wrongly arrested
for the motel strangling of Amaryllis' mother), the title of this
book has become an extremely empty promise.</TE>
<TE>   What we're not prepared for, and perhaps not really meant to
notice, is that "I'll Let You Go" springs into real life, in the
novelistic sense, somewhere rather far along in the book, when the
adorably inquisitive Trotter kids (Lucy is writing a detective story
account of the search for Tull's father), accompanied as always by
Edward's great Dane, Pullman (by far the most fully fleshed Trotter
family member), descend from the enormously expensive and absurdly
large vehicle they normally travel about in to visit the
shabby-genteel Redlands home of character Marcus Weiner's parents.</TE>
<TE>   It should never be said that Wagner doesn't do his homework; most
of this book reads like homework, a meticulous fantasy construction
of the lives of the super-rich and the super-poor woven out of
unimaginable research and not much close observation or experience.
The bravely striving, quotidian world of Harry and Ruth Weiner, their
tchotchkes and photo albums and scrubby backyard, however, is
rendered with an authenticity and familiarity entirely absent from
the rest of this novel.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, even when Harry and Ruth are planted in the artificed
realms of criminal court or one of the Trotters' opulent dining
rooms, they intrude a jarring note of reality into what, for all its
episodes of violence, insanity, internecine antagonisms, rapes,
batterings and shopping sprees, never quite feels like anything that
did ever happen or could ever happen. To put it another way, the
Weiners are like cinema verite footage spliced into an interminable
and cozily trite special effects film called "All's Well That Ends
Well, If You Have a Lot of Money."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure if this answers the question "Why is he writing
this?" but "I'll Let You Go" feels more like a book meant to flatter
and impress a coterie without much interest in literature beyond its
utility for cinematic mutilation than a work wrenched from anywhere
like home. It tells us that the unbelievably rich suffer just as you
and I do and that the terribly poor can make it through their
nightmare if they really try. The possibility that many of us,
including some of this moment's gilded claque, will wind up living
the sedate, unspectacular lives of Harry and Ruth Weiner at the end
of our days is the one possibility this novel refuses to entertain, a
refusal that begins to sound, after a few hundred pages, a lot like
the lyrics of "Hooray for Hollywood."</TE>

<LD>AMERICAN SON, A Novel, By Brian Ascalon Roley, W.W. Norton:  256 pp.,
$13 paper</LD>
<LD>   Self-invention has always been an element of the California dream,
no less in life than in art. The latest variations on the theme,
however, are boiling up from some surprising places. "American Son"
and "Chicken" allow us to see how young men on the margins--the son
of a Filipino immigrant in the first, a sexually adventurous
adolescent in the second, both very much "at risk"--struggle to
scrape out places for themselves in the Southern California
landscape.</LD>
<LD>   Tomas, the dangerous but compelling young man whom we meet in
Brian Ascalon Roley's "American Son," is "half white, half Filipino,
but dresses like a Mexican." He makes money buying pit bulls from
poor black people in Compton and reselling the dogs to rich white
people in Brentwood. As if to convince his clients that he is an
authentic gangbanger, he shaves his head and decorates himself with
tattoos of various styles, which the author describes as "gang,
Spanish, and old-lady Catholic." His Filipino mother is baffled by
the strange torque he has applied to the American dream that brought
the family to the United States in the first place.</LD>
<TE>   "She cannot understand why if he wants to be something he is not,"
observes his younger brother, Gabe. "He does not at least try to look
white."</TE>
<TE>   Gabe, who narrates the novel, is the shy and compliant son who is
always ready to help his mother and brother. Gabe washes the dogs
before they are delivered to his brother's customers, but Tomas
orders him to stay in the car when he goes to the door. "One look at
you," says Tomas to Gabe, "and they'll think these dogs were raised
by a bunch of wimps." But it is Gabe whose voice we hear in "American
Son," and all of the intriguing but unsettling sights we are shown
are seen through his discerning eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "American Son," not unlike Jonathan Franzen's "The Corrections"
and much else in recent American fiction, shows how family members
are capable of afflicting and disappointing one another. But it is
overlaid with a much more ambitious theme: Roley wants us to see how
our authentic selves can be betrayed and corrupted by the thoroughly
American phenomenon of self-invention. For Roley, the breeding and
training of attack dogs symbolizes how readily we tamper with our own
origins.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomas always gives the dogs German names and trains them with
foreign words," Gabe explains. "He tells the celebrities and rich
people he sells them to that they have pedigrees that go back to
Germany, and that they descend from dogs the Nazis used. All this is
a lie, of course. But the clients seem to like the explanation, even
this movie producer who has a Jewish name. He paid six thousand
dollars for the one dog and it was not even the best in the litter."</TE>
<TE>   Gabe attempts to flee the family home, stealing his brother's car
and heading toward the northeastern corner of California, where the
denizens wear Stetsons and listen to country music and go hunting.
"This sort of place," he observes, "is not supposed to be in
California." No matter how far he runs, however, Gabe cannot escape
the crosscurrents of race, class and family that swirl around him,
and he is drawn ever deeper into despair and danger when he returns
to Los Angeles. At every moment, at every level, Tomas and Gabe and
their mother injure one another in intimate ways, even when they try
to rescue each other.</TE>
<TE>   "At times she looks mad but at others she seems hurt," muses Gabe,
"and I cannot tell which look is my memory and which is my
imagination."</TE>
<TE>   "American Son" is Roley's debut as a novelist, but the book bears
none of the tool marks of first fiction. Roley writes with assurance,
grace and insight, and he plays expertly with our perceptions and
expectations: His tale ends in a shocking incident of rough justice
that is horrifying and yet somehow satisfying and even exhilarating.
And Roley is one young writer with something important to say: He has
fused a coming-of-age story with a variant on the American immigrant
saga, and the result is both explosive and illuminating.</TE>
<TE>   "Chicken" is a story of self-invention too, but one with a starkly
different setting. To hear David Henry Sterry tell it, he arrived in
Los Angeles in the early 1970s as a 17-year-old freshman at
Immaculate Heart College, accepted the offer of a place to crash from
a friendly stranger on Hollywood Boulevard, endured a brutal sexual
assault from his host and then tumbled into the life of a "chicken,"
a term that is used on the streets to describe an adolescent
prostitute.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sick twisted Wonderland," warns Sterry, "and I'm Alice."</TE>
<TE>   Sterry's memoir is often overwrought and always overwritten, but
he is dealing in a commodity that is sure to command the reader's
attention: the dirty little secrets about what men and women do
behind closed doors. Even his clients want to hear exactly what he
does with other women: "Spare no detail," his very first client
instructs him, "and use all the naughty words." Sterry follows the
same advice here.</TE>
<TE>   The author's resume, according to his publisher, includes acting,
athletics, marriage counseling and stand-up comedy, all of which are
prefigured in his life as a "humpster of the rich and famous." Mere
sexual prowess, as Sterry allows us to see, is not enough to please a
demanding client of a male prostitute in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Baby and Sweety, for example, are a pair of women who want him to
put on a black see-through apron and polish the silver. Georgia is a
frustrated wife who seems to take pleasure only in complaining about
her husband. An aging hippie who calls herself Rainbow reads his palm
and tutors him in Tantric sex. "The crumpled bills in my pocket are
filling me with the life force," Sterry writes. "Rainbow and I
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhmmmm for about a fortnight."</TE>
<TE>   Between glimpses of his work life, Sterry summons up memories of
childhood. His parents emigrated from England with high hopes for the
good life in America but ended up divorced and embittered. He was
never sexually abused, Sterry tells us, but neither was he given much
of a sexual education. "The good news, son," his father told him one
day after church when he was only 10, "is that if it's done properly,
you can get the whole thing over with in less than a minute!"</TE>
<TE>   Most of Sterry's experiences are played for laughs or thrills or
both, but one encounter is so grotesque, so pathetic and so
heartbreaking--a bereaved woman trying desperately to conjure up both
a dead husband and a dead son--that it sends Sterry into a downward
spiral. "What a couple of funked-up ducks we are," he cries in
despair, "this ex-mom slash ex-wife and I, trying to get some love in
the worst way." By then, Sterry is ready to get out, and so are we.</TE>

<DH>BEYOND ILLUSIONS, A Novel, By Duong Thu Huong, Translated
from the Vietnamese by Nina McPherson  and Phan Huy Duong, Hyperion
East: 244 pp., $23.95</DH>

<LD>BEYOND ILLUSIONS, A Novel, By Duong Thu Huong, Translated from the
Vietnamese by Nina McPherson</LD>
<LD>   The Vietnamese government's ban on the writings of Duong Thu Huong
has turned a local dissident into an international figure. Political
authorities confiscated her first novel, "Beyond Illusions," when it
was published in 1987, but Vietnamese readers snapped up thousands of
copies before they disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   The following year authorities condemned Huong's second novel,
"Paradise of the Blind," and her advocacy of political reforms soon
got her expelled from the Communist Party and jailed for months
without trial. But in 1993 a translation of "Paradise" reached
audiences around the world, and the author's growing fame led
publishers abroad to print two more of her books banned at home.</LD>
<TE>   Now Huong's debut novel has finally been translated into English:
the story of how Linh, an idealistic young schoolteacher in postwar
Hanoi, moves "beyond illusions" about politics and love.</TE>
<TE>   Linh has married Nguyen, an older man who dazzles her with
idealistic eloquence about the battles his generation fought against
America, China, legacies of colonialism and the feudal past. But when
government officials betray the cause that put them in power, Nguyen
balks at using his position as a journalist to expose them.</TE>
<TE>   To safeguard his newspaper job, he covers up the swindles of party
leaders and the failure of their policies to solve the shortages of
food, work and housing that pit ordinary citizens against one another
in daily struggles to survive. He even praises the monumentally
stupid agricultural development projects that are destroying the
nation's food supply.</TE>
<TE>   Disillusioned, Linh leaves Nguyen for a gifted musician with a
seemingly noble soul, but he turns out to be a smooth-talking party
climber who has seduced dozens of women.</TE>
<TE>   Loathing the Lothario is a pleasure. So is weighing the ideas of
minor philosophers who pop up--Professor Le, lawyer Trung, a nameless
painter. Still, though the historical background compels interest,
the plot can feel melodramatic and incoherent.</TE>
<TE>   An author who so distrusts sentimentality should avoid "human
dreams mingled with ... suffering" and "music ... from the secret
storms of the heart," and one wishes her characters wouldn't "scream"
so often inside themselves or at one another. The omniscient point of
view sometimes lurches, as when Nguyen gazes into his wife's eyes
while admiring the beauty mark on the back of her neck.</TE>
<TE>   But "Beyond Illusions" was Huong's first book. In "Paradise of the
Blind" and "Novel Without a Name"--Phan Huy Duong and Nina McPherson
also translated these--the first-person narrators make subtle,
evolving syntheses of life's jolts and noise, so that the characters
in the stories develop instead of just changing their minds. Readers
of "Beyond Illusions" who know Huong's other work will recognize the
authenticity and integrity of her vision.</TE>
<TE>   They'll also get to trace the impressive artistic growth of a
writer who should be honored, in any case, for daring to tell the
truth when only silence is safe.</TE>

<DH>TISHOMINGO BLUES, A Novel, By Elmore Leonard, William
Morrow: 308 pages, $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM NOLAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dennis Lenahan, the chief protagonist of "Tishomingo Blues," Elmore
Leonard's terrifically entertaining and darkly amusing 37th novel, is
a simple enough fellow. But simple, in Elmore Leonard territory, does
not equal normal.</LD>
<LD>   Lenahan earns his pay ($300 a day) as "a professional exhibition
diver," leaping from the top of an 80-foot steel ladder into a
9-foot-deep tank that looks no bigger, from his high perch, than "a
fifty-cent piece on the floor." He's a good performer. "But with
divers," Lenahan himself observes, "they say the better the
performer, the less stable the personality."</LD>
<LD>   Lenahan's stability and safety are endangered during a
single-season, first-time engagement at the Tishomingo Lodge and
Casino in Tunica, Miss., when, from atop his diving platform at
twilight, he witnesses an ex-convict being shot to death by two
members of the local "Dixie Mafia."</LD>
<TE>   The victim, a rigger hired to help Lenahan with his equipment, is
sketched in a few deft strokes: "This was a man by the name of Floyd
Showers from Biloxi, a skinny guy in his fifties with a sunken mouth
and skidrow ways about him. He always had a pint of Maker's Mark and
cigarette butts in the pockets of the threadbare suitcoat he wore
with his overalls, wore it even during the heat of the day."</TE>
<TE>   The killers know Lenahan knows what they did. But, as an
intermediary explains, they figure that they have a
don't-ask-don't-tell understanding with the high diver.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep quiet or get shot," Lenahan sums up. "That's some deal."
Soon a whole gallery of quirky types is pushing Lenahan in new
directions.</TE>
<TE>   There's Robert Taylor, the glib, blues-loving African American--"a
guy with style and what he called his own agenda," also a
mum's-the-word witness to the killing--who seems to ad-lib a new scam
every day. "What're you selling?" asks Lenahan, quickly drawn into
Taylor's magnetic orbit. "Myself, man," he answers, "myself."</TE>
<TE>   And there's Charlie Hoke, the Tishomingo Lodge's "celebrity host,"
an ex-ballplayer whose No. 1 fan is himself: "I've struck out Al
Oliver, Gorman Thomas and Jim Rice. Darrell Evans, Mike Schmidt, Bill
Madlock. Willie McGee, Don Mattingly, and I fanned Wade Boggs twice
in the same game--if those names mean anything to you."</TE>
<TE>   And there's Jerry Mularoni, the Detroit gangster come to
Tishomingo to take part in a Civil War battle reenactment as Ulysses
S. Grant. And there's Mularoni's wife, Anne, to whom Taylor is
attracted.</TE>
<TE>   "Was he still in love?" Taylor wonders of Mularoni. "It was hard
to tell with a gangster. Robert believed [Jerry] loved [Anne] the way
he loved a pair of good-looking alligator shoes he'd never let go
of."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard's method, here as in other books, is to throw his oddball
characters together and see which way the plot bounces. Alliances
form and break apart. Bluffs provoke counter-bluffs. Hidden motives
emerge. As Taylor says, "Man, you know there's always more to what
you see going on than meets the eye."</TE>
<TE>   What's going on in this tale, it emerges in time, is a move for
control of the regional drug trade. Mularoni hopes to seize the
territory from the local frontman and his Dixie Mafia cohorts and
controllers. And he aims to use the Civil War battle reenactment to
implement and cover up his cop. But Taylor, who's sold the scheme to
Mularoni, has his own covert agenda: Eliminate Mularoni and install
himself as boss.</TE>
<TE>   The folks in "Tishomingo Blues," as they jockey for control of the
local drug trade and one another's destinies, are like a roomful of
con artists playing liar's poker with a deck of wild cards. It seems
sure that more than one of them will be dealt a dead-man's hand,
especially given that certain guns in that Civil War battle
reenactment are loaded with real bullets.</TE>
<TE>   It's instructive to note that Leonard entered the landscape of
American letters from a highway built by Hemingway and John O'Hara,
via an offramp marked George V. Higgins. Leonard learned nothing of
use to him and his stories, he's said, from poetic prose men like
Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald ("those first-person guys"), but
a lot from the dialogue-driven tales of O'Hara and from Higgins' "The
Friends of Eddie Coyle."</TE>
<TE>   Having turned himself from a Detroit ad man into a writer first of
Westerns and then of crime fiction, Leonard crafts a lean narrative
propelled by speech and descriptive sentences that move with the
rhythm of talk.</TE>
<TE>   The late writer Grover Lewis said American art comes disguised as
entertainment. Leonard at his best is (like Hemingway and O'Hara and
Higgins) a great entertainer. Not knowing for sure what people will
do is part of the pleasure of reading "Tishomingo Blues." Leonard's
characters live in a world in flux and, to their minds, almost
anything is possible. We read his stories to see what happens next,
but they surprise us with terse, poignant glimpses of our land and
certain figures moving through it. If we peer hard at those figures,
we may see exaggerated versions of ourselves: people trying to get
from Point A to Point B in one piece, with a certain amount of grace.</TE>
<TE>   How to rate the 37th novel by a 76-year-old author who's in a
class by himself? Compare it to his previous work?</TE>
<TE>   "Tishomingo Blues" is funnier than "Cuba Libre" but not as droll
as "Get Shorty." Its mise-en-scene isn't as hip as "Be Cool's," but
it's more fun than "Stick's." This novel is less poignant than "Pagan
Babies," but it's more moving than "Maximum Bob."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, "Tishomingo Blues" is typical Elmore Leonard. Who
could ask for anything more?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Tishomingo Blues'</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Darwin, this is Dennis Lenahan, world champion high diver. We
met one time in Atlantic City."</TE>
<TE>   Billy Darwin said, "We did?"</TE>
<TE>   "I remember I thought at first you were Robert Redford, only
you're a lot younger. You were running the sports book at Spade's."
Dennis waited. When there was no response he said, "How high is your
hotel?"</TE>
<TE>   This Billy Darwin was quick. He said, "You want to dive off the
roof?"</TE>
<TE>   "Into your swimming pool," Dennis said, "twice a day as a special
attraction."</TE>
<TE>   "We go up seven floors."</TE>
<TE>   "That sounds just right."</TE>
<TE>   "But the pool's about a hundred feet away. You'd have to take a
good running start, wouldn't you?"</TE>
<TE>   Right there, Dennis knew he could work something out with this
Billy Darwin. "I could set my tank right next to the hotel, dive from
the roof into nine feet of water. Do a matinee performance and one at
night with spotlights on me, seven days a week."</TE>
<TE>   "How much you want?"</TE>
<TE>   Dennis spoke right up, talking to a man who dealt with high
rollers. "Five hundred a day."</TE>
<TE>   "How long a run?"</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of the season. Say eight weeks."</TE>
<TE>   "You're worth twenty-eight grand?"</TE>
<TE>   That quick, off the top of his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I have setup expenses--hire a rigger and put in a system to
filter the water in the tank. It stands more than a few days it gets
scummy."</TE>
<TE>   "You don't perform all year?"</TE>
<TE>   "If I can work six months I'm doing good."</TE>
<TE>   "Then what?"</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a ski instructor, a bartender ...."</TE>
<TE>   Billy Darwin's quiet voice asked him, "Where are you?"</TE>
<TE>   In a room at the Fiesta Motel, Panama City, Florida, Dennis told
him, performing every evening at the Miracle Strip amusement park.
"My contract'll keep me here till the end of the month," Dennis said,
"but that's it. I've reached the point .... Actually I don't think I
can do another amusement park all summer."</TE>
<TE>   There was a silence on the line, Billy Darwin maybe wondering why
but not curious enough to ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Darwin?"</TE>
<TE>   He said, "Can you get away before you finish up there?"</TE>
<TE>   "If I can get back the same night, before showtime."</TE>
<TE>   Something the man would like to hear.</TE>
<TE>   He said, "Fly into Memphis. Take 61 due south and in thirty
minutes you're in Tunica, Mississippi."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis said, "Is it a nice town?"</TE>
<TE>   But got no answer. The man had hung up.</TE>

<DH>NIGGER: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word, By
Randall Kennedy, Pantheon: 228 pp., $22</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ISHMAEL REED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six years ago, Robert S. Boynton in the Atlantic Monthly nominated a
group of new black intellectuals whom he hailed for going beyond race
to look at the "commonality of American concern." Yet if race were
placed in the background of their work, none of the writers and
thinkers he mentioned would be in business.</LD>
<LD>   Americans are fascinated with race, and so it is inevitable that
merely placing the word "nigger" on the cover of a book guarantees
controversy and book sales. And because it is a book written by an
African American, a professor at Harvard Law School at that, it is a
strategy that creates a rift among the African American
intelligentsia, many of whom seem to be proxies for white,
neo-liberal opinion. As Lewis Lapham, editor of Harper's, said of one
of the chosen, "He says what we say in private." No wonder these
writers receive such an uncritical free pass in those publications
whose opinions they mirror.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes it appears that these black intellectuals are willing to
sacrifice scholarship for the sake of publicity and cash. When Henry
Louis Gates Jr., who has described himself as an "intellectual
entrepreneur," was assembling a staff to compile an encyclopedia of
black history, of the 40 full-time writers and editors brought to the
project, "Encarta Africana," only three were black. In addition,
according to Mother Jones magazine, Gates and co-editor K. Anthony
Appiah turned down requests from white staffers to hire more African
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Works of dubious scholarly merit are given inflated advances by
publishers. Nearly nine years ago, for example, Michael Lerner and
Cornel West were awarded a reported $100,000 advance for their slim
collection of essays, "Jews &amp; Blacks: A Dialogue on Race, Religion,
and Culture in America." Some of these works are rewritings of other
works and contain no new or original insights. John McWorther
("Losing the Race") writes about black "victimization," a territory
already exhausted by Shelby Steele, a much better and more thoughtful
writer. McWorther goes so far as to say that blacks are
"anti-intellectual" when, according to Martin Arnold of the New York
Times, blacks since Sept. 11 are buying books in numbers that seem to
be "a bit better than [in] white mainstream publishing."</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the black intelligentsia, it might be argued, is to
justify white opinion that might seem racist. For example, another
member of the Talented Tenth--W.E.B. DuBois' name for the black
intellectual vanguard--Orlando Patterson says that whites moved to
the suburbs because of the bad behavior of black school students,
which doesn't explain why whites segregate themselves from model
minorities like Cuban Americans. Randall Kennedy himself has played
to irrational white fears by arguing that whites have a right to
avoid young blacks because of crime statistics, yet, more than 75% of
violent crimes against whites are committed by other whites. Given
this fact, why aren't white women afraid to board elevators with
white men? In an unscholarly fashion, the Talented Tenth often ignore
facts that might challenge their premises. For example, Gates in his
standard "tough love" speech, scolds "35-year-old black grandmothers
living in the projects"; what he and his friends fail to mention is
that the "out-of-wedlock" birthrate among black women has plummeted
faster than that of any other ethnic group. It took conservative
columnist Ben Wattenberg to comment about this trend.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's book, "Nigger," is being sold on the basis of the
questions it answers. "How should 'nigger' be defined?" Kennedy asks.
"Is it part of the American cultural inheritance that warrants
preservation? ... Should blacks be able to use 'nigger' in ways
forbidden to others? Should the law view 'nigger' as a provocation
strong enough to reduce the culpability of a person who responds
violently to it? Under what circumstances, if any, should a person be
ousted from his or her job for saying 'nigger'? What methods are
useful for depriving 'nigger' of destructiveness?"</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Kennedy's new book provides guidelines about when
it's appropriate to use the word and when it's not. Under some
conditions, he argues, whites should be able to use the word
regardless of "the embarrassment and hurt feelings the term
inflicts."</TE>
<TE>   The short book, an expanded essay, includes four sections, of
which two, "The Protean N-Word" and the "Pitfalls in Fighting
'Nigger,'" are sometimes interesting. All four sections include
anecdotes, folklore and memoirs of celebrities about the use of the
word "nigger." Its history is explored and the use of the word by
famous comedians such as Richard Pryor are cited. Pryor stopped using
the word after a trip to Africa. We learn that Lenny Bruce used the
word to weaken its potency, to "defang" the word, a strategy of which
Kennedy approves. He also analyzes the motives of whites and blacks
for using the word.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the analysis is light. For blacks, he argues, the term can
be a positive, but it can also reflect self-hatred. If Kennedy
believes that self-hatred is unique to African Americans, he knows
very little about the United States' other ethnic groups. Attributing
certain attitudes exclusively to blacks is a common practice of the
black intelligentsia for whom African Americans are the most
homophobic, misogynistic or anti-Semitic of all ethnic groups. This
approach exposes the one-dimensionality of their thought. They just
haven't studied other American ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy also accuses blacks of being oversensitive about the use
of the word "nigger." If they're oversensitive, they're not the only
ethnic group to be offended by ethnic slurs. In fact, based upon my
reading, I would say that blacks are the least thin-skinned of
American ethnic groups. They are constantly ridiculed in Hollywood
movies and on television. Booker T. Washington complained about the
press coverage of blacks almost 100 years ago. To expose the warts of
others--even in ridicule--is considered by some to reveal the secrets
of the community or provide the enemy with ammunition, but it is done
to the African American community with relative impunity.</TE>
<TE>   I found reading through the section "'Nigger' in Court" to be
rough sledding. Kennedy discusses cases in which jurors, lawyers or
jurists have referred to blacks as "niggers." (Whites who deny that
racism exists in the criminal justice system will be shocked by this,
just as they were shocked by the revelation that some Los Angeles
policemen plant evidence.) In addition, he examines cases in which a
black person used the "fighting-word" defense when charged with
assaulting a white person who used the word, and cases in which
racial slurs are used on the job or in commerce and, finally, cases
in which witnesses or litigants use the term. Kennedy contends that a
white person's calling a black person "nigger" is no excuse for
harming that person and that blacks should show Ellisonian patience
when assaulted by the term. When I read this line, all I could think
of was what Julian Bond once wrote, "Look at that girl shake that
thing/We all can't be Martin Luther King."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy believes that if a black person and a white person are
intimates, then it's all right for the white person to call his
friend a "nigger": "Can a relationship between a black person and a
white one be such that the white person should properly feel
authorized, within the confines of that relationship, to use the
N-word? For me the answer is yes."</TE>
<TE>   He also approves of Harry Truman's and Lyndon Johnson's use of the
word because they inaugurated programs that were beneficial to black
people. (He could have included Abraham Lincoln who, according to
historian Lerone Bennett Jr., used "nigger" often and loved minstrel
shows so much that sometimes he would miss appointments to attend
one.)</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's comments about the use of the word by rappers show the
isolation of Talented Tenth. They live in academic settings, white
enclaves, such as Cambridge, Mass., and New Haven, Conn., and don't
have a clue about Compton. Ice-T, in a recent interview, said that
some of the rappers were former criminals who condoned the drugging
of African Americans from 1984 until recently, so long as they could
make a profit from it. He said that with hip-hop, they became
legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   In his film "Images of Hip-Hop in the Bay Area," author Cecil
Brown interviews some rappers. They come across as cynical, amoral
capitalists who know what turns on their white suburban audience.
This audience seems to need their "nigger" fix. Rather than being
heroes who use the word as a sign of independence, as Kennedy would
have us believe, these rappers are merely marketing a product.</TE>
<TE>   "These entertainers don't care whether whites are confused by
blacks' use of the term," he writes. "And they don't care whether
whites who hear blacks using the N-word think that African Americans
lack self-respect. The black comedians and rappers who use and enjoy
'nigger' care principally, perhaps exclusively, about what they
themselves think, desire and enjoy--which is part of their allure."
Whatever.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago novelist Charles Johnson and I were sitting in the
rear of a room where white professors were arguing about whether Mark
Twain had a right to use the word. They used the word with what I
felt to be excessive enthusiasm, as though they were high on
something, as though the word were some form of verbal crack. Johnson
turned to me and said. "What am I doing here?" Many black readers
will probably feel the same way when reading Kennedy's book.</TE>

<LD>MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA</LD>
<LD>   By James McBride</LD>
<LD>   Riverhead Books: 288 pp., $24.95</LD>
<TE>   "Miracle at St. Anna," by the author of "The Color of Water," is
set in Tuscany, Italy, during World War II. It is the story of four
members of G Company, in the all-black 92nd Division, nicknamed the
Buffalo Soldiers. They are stationed in the Apuane Alps.</TE>
<TE>   Hector Negron, the radioman, is a 21-year-old Puerto Rican from
Spanish Harlem. Bishop Cummings is a minister from Kansas City whose
main gift is the power of speech: Watching him preach is like
"watching a steam pump sucking coal on a hot July day." Second Lt.
Aubrey Stamps, skin the "color of chestnuts," is a champion swimmer
back home in Arlington, Va. Sam Train, from North Carolina, is 6 feet
6 and weighs 275 pounds. The men in his company call him "Diesel" or
"Sniper Bait" because he is all heart and not too brainy.</TE>
<TE>   On Train's first day in Florence, he finds a marble head that the
Germans shot off a statue on the Ponte Santa Trinita. Commissioned in
1590, the statue has seen its share of miracles. Train carries the
head in a net bag on his hip and rubs it for good luck. He believes
that it is the head that makes him invisible to the German soldiers.
He is knocked out by an explosion while crossing a canal on foot, and
Bishop sweet-talks him back to consciousness (Train, after all, owes
Bishop $1,400 from poker games).</TE>
<TE>   Regaining consciousness, Train spots a 6-year-old Italian boy
hiding in a barn. When they are attacked and a beam falls on the boy,
Train runs into the barn and lifts the beam off the boy, who opens
his eyes and thinks he has seen a "chocolate giant." For his part,
Train believes the boy is an angel and carries him, accompanied by
the three other soldiers, to St. Anna, where they take refuge in the
home of some villagers, awaiting orders from their captain while
12,000 German troops make their way toward the village.</TE>
<TE>   The war in central Italy, McBride writes, was fought "by Gurkhas,
Italians, Brazilians, British, Africans, even Russian defectors, and
most of all, by American Negroes, who were convinced that the white
man [American and German] was trying to kill them." The novel is full
of miracles, of friendship, of salvation and survival. But mostly,
"Miracle at St. Anna" is about the love Train and the boy have for
each other. Both are blessed, and for all their differences, they
recognize each other.</TE>

<TE>   HELL'S BOTTOM, COLORADO</TE>
<TE>   By Laura Pritchett</TE>
<TE>   Milkweed Editions: 142 pp., $14.95</TE>
<TE>   In almost all of Laura Pritchett's stories in this collection
about a family of ranchers in Colorado, there is a wounded animal: a
horse with its back legs shot off, a stillborn calf, a pigeon with
string caught around its legs. Pritchett portrays human cruelty on
the margins of decency and, conversely, human kindness on the margins
of survival: Each story pivots on one of these points.</TE>
<TE>   Renny and Ben are divorced but still friends. Their children,
Caroline and Rachel, each have two children. Rachel's husband, Ray,
is a no-account violent loser who is cruel to her children and
murders Rachel in front of her parents. The legacy of this murder is
lifted out of sequence, told as if it were told in retrospect and
fractured by the memories of the characters. The interlocking stories
allow a reader to see incidents from many angles. They ricochet like
bullets off Renny and Ben's family tree. They are jarring, deeply
violent; the fates they hold seem unavoidable.</TE>

<TE>   MARS &amp; VENUS IN THE WORKPLACE</TE>
<TE>   A Practical Guide for Improving Communication  and Getting Results
at Work</TE>
<TE>   By John Gray</TE>
<TE>   Harper Collins: 320 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   It's a little dated, this "Mars and Venus" thing. To benefit from
John Gray's advice, you have to agree with Gray's assertion that men
and women are completely different: that women are relaters and men
are avoiders, that women want to be cared for and men demand trust,
that women love to communicate and men shut down whenever possible.
The workplace Gray describes also seems dated. It is a competitive,
bottom-line, eat or be eaten environment where it is inappropriate to
cry or show emotion. "A woman's challenge in the workplace is much
greater than a man's," Gray writes, primarily because she is hobbled
by her self-effacing insistence on the importance of relationships
over successful outcomes. The most we can do is try to earn each
other's respect.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, I wouldn't want the respect of the men Gray describes.
One can't use too many words talking to these Martians because first
they lose interest, then they lose respect. To offer advice is to
insult them. Other specious assertions: Women care more about
relationships than money? Women must promote themselves more and
advertise their accomplishments? I don't recognize any of these
people. Do you? Perhaps they inhabit a different galaxy.</TE>

<DH>WITTGENSTEIN'S POKER: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument
Between Two Great Philosophers, By David Edmonds and John Eidinow,
Ecco Press: 340 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ROMANO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One chilly October evening in 1946, a group of Cambridge philosophers
and students gathered for the weekly meeting of the Moral Science
Club. They were to hear a paper by Karl Popper. Among those present
was Bertrand Russell, an admirer of Popper's recently published "The
Open Society and Its Enemies"; then in his 70s, Russell had helped
Popper earlier in his career. Also present, and presiding, was
another Russell protege: Ludwig Wittgenstein, arguably the most
brilliant and unarguably the most exciting and influential
philosopher of his time. Popper later admitted going to Cambridge
expressly to challenge Wittgenstein over the direction in which he
was taking contemporary philosophy.</LD>
<LD>   He succeeded too well: Wittgenstein stormed out after only 10
minutes, but not before denouncing Popper's ideas and brandishing a
poker at him. According to whose version you believe--and the
delightful "Wittgenstein's Poker" offers several--the poker was
red-hot or cool; Wittgenstein used it to threaten Popper or was
merely toying with it; he threw it down in anger or he didn't.</LD>
<TE>   Readers are also invited to decide whether it's true, as Popper
and others recalled, that Wittgenstein's exit was prompted by a
clever, climactic retort. When Wittgenstein demanded that Popper cite
a valid instance of a moral principle, Popper replied, "Not to
threaten visiting lecturers with pokers." It was all Wittgenstein
could bear: The great interrupter and dominator of every
philosophical conversation in the first half of the 20th century,
accustomed to acolytes, adored even by his seniors, charged out.</TE>
<TE>   David Edmonds and John Eidinow are not philosophers but BBC
journalists who have written an engaging and accessible book about a
charged moment in the history of ideas. They succeed splendidly in
convincing us that the night's events--remembered, misremembered and
angrily debated by eyewitnesses and researchers since--were a kind of
high-cultural watershed, and the clash between Wittgenstein and
Popper has the glamour of a small epic.</TE>
<TE>   Provoked by the horrors of totalitarianism, right and left, Popper
had written his "Open Society" as a critique of absolutist thought
from Plato to the present. It was a rear guard action on behalf of
the humanistic, morally engaged tradition in philosophy against the
rise of the newer, purely analytic movement in which Wittgenstein was
preeminent. In his triumph, Wittgenstein gave birth to much that he
would never have endorsed: the fashionable view, for instance, that
language is only a self-referential game, that it can never be used
to probe or understand the world we live in or the lives we live.
"Deconstruction" of truth claims in science or history, as well as
the postmodern ambivalence toward commitment, moral or otherwise, can
all convincingly be traced to his influence.</TE>
<TE>   As individuals, the two antagonists could not have been more
different: Wittgenstein was vivid, aggressive, charismatic; Popper,
though equally fierce in argument, was ordinary in person, entirely
lacking his opponent's subversive charm. Later, nothing would so mark
their differences as the way they responded to the Nazi takeover of
Austria in 1938. Popper fled with his family, while Wittgenstein,
already out of the country, used his immense inherited fortune to
negotiate with the new regime for the protection of two sisters who
refused to leave. He was successful. The order granting them a change
of status was personally given by Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   But what of Popper's topic on that night: "Are There Philosophical
Problems?" Why was so much at stake in the obvious-sounding question?
Another way of phrasing it would have been: Are philosophical
problems real? Or, as Wittgenstein argued, are they just language
games, puzzles to be solved by sorting out the words we use when
speaking to one another?</TE>
<TE>   For Popper, questions such as "How do we acquire knowledge?," "How
do we tell right from wrong?" or "How ought we to be governed?" were
not only discussable but urgent, even if not susceptible to definite
answers. For Wittgenstein, to ask these questions was, in a famous
phrase, to allow our intelligence to be "bewitched by language." He
held that curing our minds of linguistic bewitchment was philosophy's
sole task, and two succeeding generations of philosophers, bewitched
perhaps by Wittgenstein, have agreed. Meanwhile Popper's influence
has been in eclipse.</TE>
<TE>   But this engrossing book should do something to restore a wider
awareness of Popper. In the book's final chapters, after offering
their own well-sifted conjectures about what "really happened" that
night, Edmond and Eidinow assess the legacies of the two
philosophers. Writing well before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
they hazard a guess that world events might reverse the decline of
Popper's reputation. They also suggest that Wittgenstein's brilliant
but non-nourishing consignment of philosophy to self-conscious
irrelevance will not continue to wear well.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, we are left on our own to decide the winner, but
"Wittgenstein's Poker" suggests that ideas matter in the real
world--the topic behind the topic--and can no longer be dispelled by
waving a poker.</TE>

<DH>UP COUNTRY, A Novel, By Nelson DeMille, Warner Books: 706
pp., $26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN SHAPIRO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nelson DeMille is a prolific and popular producer of detective novels
whose dependably entertaining works usually warrant an entire shelf
of retail space. Often set in interesting locations (inside the NYPD,
the CIA and the former Soviet Union, to name a few), they are
researched deeply and written well. That is clear in his noteworthy
achievement, "The General's Daughter," a murder mystery set on a U.S.
military base (and a far better book than the ghastly 1999 movie
version).</LD>
<LD>   A sequel to that bestseller, DeMille's "Up Country" centers once
again on Paul Brenner, the wisecracking but rarely wise U.S. Army
criminal investigator. Having been forced into early retirement as a
result of his tendency to buck authority, Brenner is bored by
civilian life, emotionally and professionally adrift, a disaffected
Vietnam vet stuck in middle-aged ennui.</LD>
<LD>   So when his old boss asks him to take on one more assignment,
Brenner has nothing better to do than accept. The case involves a
murder committed in Vietnam more than 30 years ago. The only evidence
is an eyewitness account from an enemy soldier who saw an
unidentified U.S. captain kill an unknown U.S. lieutenant in the
midst of the bloody Tet Offensive.</LD>
<TE>   Brenner must return to Vietnam, locate the witness and identify
the victim and perpetrator, all while confronting the ghosts of his
past and the errors of his nation. The mission sounds suitably
impossible, but if he succeeds, he might just pave the way to a new
golden age of relations between the two nations and even obtain the
most absurd of all modern conceits: closure. Convoluted as it
becomes, the plot is just a cover for a dramatized travelogue
inspired by DeMille's return trip to Vietnam about 30 years after he
served and fought there.</TE>
<TE>   Like any tourist, Brenner visits places of interest, learns about
the country's infrastructure and has lots of transportation problems
involving bad roads and worse drivers. Along the way, he takes on a
travel companion, an American businesswoman who admits to being a
predatory capitalist, and confronts the evil Colonel Mang, a
Communist stereotype who spouts the kind of anti-American
sloganeering we've not heard since Aldo Ray and John Wayne wore green
berets.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, DeMille wants us to know Vietnam is a complicated place.
But "Up Country" amounts to little more than a tedious description of
a bad road trip. What was charming about the Brenner character in the
earlier book becomes irksome this time around; his insolence is not
diminished because he refers to himself without much irony as
"charmingly irresponsible and delightfully smart-assed." The dialogue
is cliched; characters say things like "trust no one" and "history is
written by the winners"; the logic of military intelligence (always
an oxymoron) is nonexistent: If the case is so sensitive, why does
the Army insist on using the wildly uncontrollable Brenner? And the
pace of the storytelling is downright drowsy as Brenner experiences
more flashbacks than a Grateful Dead fan.</TE>
<TE>   Though one salutes DeMille's service to his country as a young
soldier and admires his commitment to trying to understand today's
Vietnam, "Up Country" is a morass.</TE>

<DH>LESTER LEAPS IN: The Life and Times of Lester "Pres" Young,

<DL></DL>
<LD>With his debut record date in November 1936, Lester Young burst fully
formed into view as one of the most original, resourcefully lyrical
and lastingly influential tenor saxophonists in jazz. His solos
seemed airborne, their conception and tone far removed from the
luxuriantly textured, magisterial utterances of Coleman Hawkins, who
a decade earlier had made the instrument a virile, muscular jazz solo
voice.</LD>
<LD>   Young's phrases were spare, implying before they declared. Witty,
elegant, debonair, insouciant, otherworldly, aphoristic,
succinct--writers groped for words that would render concrete an
essence, a set of qualities, that remained deliciously abstract.
Listening to Young play, said one, was like watching Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers dancing; their feet appeared never to touch the floor.</LD>
<LD>   Even the newcomer's major inspirations--the poised lyricism of the
white cornetist Bix Beiderbecke and his stylish associate, C-melody
saxophonist Frank Trumbauer--were unusual in a black jazzman of the
time. Both Bix and "Tram" were masters of musical narrative; their
solos "told a little story," as Young liked to put it. At first he'd
played alto, and in moving to the deeper tenor he simply brought
along the lightness and sense of understatement absorbed from
listening to Beiderbecke and Trumbauer.</LD>
<TE>   No less important, as Douglas Henry Daniels emphasizes in "Lester
Leaps In," the saxophonist spent much of his boyhood in and around
New Orleans, absorbing not only the music but the manner, speech and
folklore with which the city and its environs resounded in the
century's early years. The particulars of Young's life and music are
well known, thanks to such scholars as Lewis Porter, Frank
Buchmann-Moller, Jan Evensmo, Loren Schoenberg, John McDonough and
Lawrence Gushee. Every phase of his musical development has been
scrutinized, every solo parsed. Few major jazz figures, with the
possible exceptions of Louis Armstrong and the short-lived
Beiderbecke, have been accorded such consistently close-focus
attention.</TE>
<TE>   What new insights into Lester Young can then emerge from yet
another biography, one written by an author whose field is not music?
Daniels himself provides a clue in his carefully worded subtitle:
"The Life and Times of Lester 'Pres' Young." It's not the music--and
that is all-important in appreciating this book's thrust and purpose.
Daniels teaches history and black studies at UC Santa Barbara, and it
is through this prism of black history that he views his subject. To
him, every aspect of Young's life--behavior, idiosyncrasies of
demeanor, dress, and speech--is a direct outgrowth of having grown up
black in 20th century America.</TE>
<TE>   Through diligent research, particularly combing oral history
transcripts and the accounts of many who have borne witness, Daniels
creates his own incarnation of Lester Young. He traces the
saxophonist's early years in his father's family band, his
apprenticeship in various Midwest and Southwest "territory" outfits
including the famed Blue Devils (with whom his prowess earned him the
nickname "Pres," for "President of the Tenor Saxophonists") and a
traveling unit led by the New Orleans cornet pioneer Joe "King"
Oliver. All this leads naturally to Young's arrival in Kansas City,
his membership in Count Basie's orchestra and to national fame on
records with Billie Holiday and countless others.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels pauses along the way to deal with such underdocumented
issues as the sense of extended family that bonded black bands as
they traversed segregated Depression-era America;
saxophonist-arranger Eddie Barefield, who knew Young early and well,
renders particularly eloquent homage to such protective camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   In this context, Daniels also challenges inflated accounts of
"cutting contests," those storied gladiatorial encounters in which
several soloists on the same instrument would battle one another for
primacy at after-hours jam sessions. "Typically it is the
competitiveness among band members and bands that is highlighted in
histories of jazz," he writes, "which all too often fail to consider
the sense of community that was so important to these musicians." He
questions, and to some extent debunks, an after-hours 1933 encounter
with Hawkins said to have taken place at the Cherry Blossom in Kansas
City. As Daniels reads his sources, it seems just as likely that
Young simply filled in for an absent Hawkins in Fletcher Henderson's
reed section that night, winning admiration for his almost casual
skill in dealing with difficult parts and unusual keys.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels repeatedly stresses the moral lessons of honesty, personal
responsibility and reliability, the "family values" Young absorbed
early and treasured all his life. He even hears Young's tenor tone
and style as "rooted in certain ideas he harbored about purity and
the inherent value of himself and of every individual." The portrait
that emerges is of a gentle, vulnerable sensibility, lending
dimension to accounts of Young's later traumatic experiences in the
World War II Army and his gradual retreat into a private realm of
thought, attitude and speech, refuge from a world of harsh, often
cruel, realities.</TE>
<TE>   But hermetically sealing him within black cultural experience and
reaction also risks doing Young the same disservice some feminist
historiography has done to accomplished women of times past: It
leaches away individuality, portraying its subject only in response
to forces obviating free will. However absorbing Daniels' version of
Young may be, the Pres is in this sense a marionette, neutered, the
very qualities that make him most fascinating swallowed in the
machinery of predestination.</TE>
<TE>   Standing behind all this, of course, is the abiding question of
whether growing up black in America has to be so immutable a
determinant of direction, thought, personality. However faintly, such
thinking echoes the mythology, misapplied often and disastrously in
the past, that a Jew born is a Jew forever: that Jewishness shapes
behavior, motivation, feeling, even apparent individuation.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels generally avoids addressing Young's music, instead either
quoting critics in quantity--always a risky procedure--or using
copious endnotes to cite scholars who have dealt with it best. Though
occasionally effective, this method also skews balance: even in
acknowledging the importance of the Basie "Jones-Smith Incorporated"
records of November 1936, for example, Daniels utterly misses the
substance of Lester's solos on "[Oh,] Lady Be Good" and "Shoe Shine
Boy," merely suggesting (risibly, in this case) that the latter title
"had special meaning for Young because he, like many other African
Americans, had shined shoes as a youngster." Similarly, there is no
mention of Young's participation in Benny Goodman's Jan. 16, 1938,
Carnegie Hall concert, though his solo on "Honeysuckle Rose" remains
one of the evening's, and his career's, unquestioned highlights. He
mentions Young's composition "Tickle-Toe" while seeming unaware of
its origin in a Beiderbecke cornet solo.</TE>
<TE>   On another level, small but persistent errors blemish the text. A
Holton trumpet is called a "Holden," the 1918 standard "Ja-Da"
becomes "Jadda." "Blue Skies," "I Want a Little Girl" and "If I Could
Be With You One Hour Tonight," among many other songs, are cited in
accounts of years predating their creation; Frank Trumbauer is
credited with a solo on a 1927 record on which he does not solo; the
"mamma-dadda" drumstick pattern has nothing to do with the "ancient
African traditions" Daniels cites but is the basis of the
double-stroke roll, a simple rudiment learned by every aspiring
drummer. On and on, in dismaying quantity.</TE>
<TE>   No matter. Douglas Henry Daniels has written a provocative book,
presenting Lester Young in a novel, even controversial light while
opening new avenues of possible investigation into one of the most
tantalizingly enigmatic of all historic jazz figures.</TE>
<TE>   But before all else, a reader is a listener, and there is no
better testimony to Young's singularity than his playing itself. So
reach for "Jive at Five," "Let Me See," "Time Out" or "Lester Leaps
In" with Basie or for any of the extraordinary moments with Holiday
or Teddy Wilson--"I Must Have That Man," "A Sailboat in the
Moonlight" or the heartbreaking "Foolin' Myself"--and understand a
beauty no words can convey, living on in the empyreal voice of Lester
Young's tenor saxophone.</TE>

<LD>They are two American actors who arrived unexpectedly in London via
New York City and Belfast, took on the roles of more than a dozen
Irish peasants, and are preparing to land in San Diego before leaving
for San Francisco, Delaware, Connecticut and elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Talk about a shrinking global village.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a whole new weird adventure for this play and for us," said
Bronson Pinchot, who with Christopher Burns is starring in the
international hit "Stones in His Pockets."</LD>
<TE>   Fresh from a four-month stint on London's West End, the two actors
are preparing to kick off the U.S. touring production, with a stop
first at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego for a Feb. 3-March 16
run.</TE>
<TE>   "Stones in His Pockets" takes place in a small Irish town, where a
Hollywood film crew is shooting a soon-to-be-forgotten epic called
"The Quiet Valley." The story is told through the eyes and words of
two characters, Jake and Charlie, who infiltrate the set and express
aspirations of stardom and an escape from normality.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very accessible play," said director Ian McElhinney,
speaking from the West End theater where "Stones" recently closed.
"It doesn't appear to have a target audience but enjoys universal
appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Jake and Charlie, Pinchot and Burns play several other
characters, including a prissy American starlet and numerous Irish
locals with varying opinions on the production.</TE>
<TE>   The multiple characters observe the film production with
combinations of ecstasy, awe, jealousy, rage and indifference. One of
the characters desires desperately to act, but after a humiliating
rejection from the film company, lines his pockets with stones and
jumps in a pond. There is also a comical ode, of sorts, to
"Riverdance."</TE>
<TE>   For Pinchot and Burns, the road to San Diego has been far from
direct.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this odd feeling, as soon as I auditioned, that things
would become strange," Pinchot said in a telephone interview from
London.</TE>
<TE>   Pinchot's premonition was correct. He and Burns originally signed
to take over the show on Broadway, where it had opened at the Golden
Theatre on April 1, 2001, earning three Tony nominations, including
best actor for originating cast members Sean Campion and Conleth
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "Stones," written by McElhinney's wife, Marie Jones, was first
produced at the Lyrick Theatre in Belfast in 1999. After playing at
the Edinburgh Festival and opening in London that same year, it moved
to the West End in May 2000. It has also played with different actors
in different languages in San Francisco, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv,
Iceland, Sweden and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Late last summer, Pinchot and Burns were hired to take over for
Campion and Hill in the Broadway production.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I was even cast," Pinchot said, "I said to Ian, 'I don't
know how serious you are about me, but I want you to know that if I
were to take this, I must go to Ireland. I need to hear and see these
people.' Ian left the room for a while, and when he came back he
said, 'OK.' We went to Belfast and never came back."</TE>
<TE>   What kept the actors abroad, indirectly, were the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11. Broadway went dark for two days after the
attack, and box office takes suffered considerably in the weeks that
followed. As a result, "Stones in His Pockets" closed Sept. 23, and
the show moved back  to the West End for a temporary run before its
regional launch in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The productions are watched over by Tony-nominated director
McElhinney, who infuses a common value into each production. "The
appeal of the play has long been the notion of where self-worth comes
from," McElhinney said. "How do others perceive you and how do you
perceive yourself?</TE>
<TE>   "These two guys are ordinary lads with no sense of self-worth, who
somehow find that in the arrival of this film crew. Everybody can
identify with the questions of who am I and what am I doing here.
It's a staple of drama and literature."</TE>
<TE>   By putting these questions within the alluring facade of a
Hollywood movie, "Stones in His Pockets" also latches onto provincial
impressions of movieland glamour, with dreams shattered along the
way, despite the many laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "The film versus reality thing is an appealing context,"
McElhinney said. "There's a dimension of colonialism or imperialism
involving American film worldwide. There's the whole perception of
Americans or Brits staying in Ireland for any length of time. There's
the viewpoint that damage can occur in some degree by people having
their economic and spiritual worlds taken over for a period."</TE>
<TE>   The play offers good laughs, Burns says, but digs deeper in its
attempts to say something pertinent about the little guy.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone tells Jake and Charlie that their dream is no good," he
said. "But things end with hope and possibilities. With everything
that's going on in the world right now, that's an important message."</TE>
<TE>   Stage veteran Burns, whose credits include "Pride's Crossing" at
Lincoln Center and "Sexual Perversity in Chicago" at the Atlantic
Theatre in New York, also enjoys the digs at Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have a love affair with Hollywood," Burns said. "But what
if the bubble is popped? Besides that, it's just fun to play
characters who all have a different take on movies and dreams and
Ireland. How many actors get to play eight or nine characters in the
same show?"</TE>
<TE>   Pinchot, perhaps best known as Balki in the 1986-93 television
series "Perfect Strangers," is also an experienced stage actor, who
appeared in the Stephen Sondheim musical "Putting It Together" in
1998 at the Mark Taper Forum and on Broadway in 1999, and who played
Autolycus in the New York Shakespeare Festival's "The Winter's Tale"
last year.</TE>
<TE>   He says that London audiences embraced the two American actors, as
did American audience members who saw the show in London.</TE>
<TE>   "We would ask them to tell us what they honestly thought," Pinchot
said. "They would say it took them a few minutes to understand the
accent--just like it took us. The accent is so complicated, and
that's why I had to hear it right away. It's not the Lucky Charms
accent. It's a really strange one that sounds almost Scottish."</TE>
<TE>   Pinchot traveled to an extreme northern region of Ireland two
weeks ago to further study the people and their speech patterns. "My
dialect coach had told me about one consonant that was very
different, and I just couldn't believe it," Pinchot said. "It was
making a 'sh' sound for an s, as in, 'Let's go out for a shteak.' I
went to this small Irish town and that sound was one of the first two
words I heard."</TE>
<TE>   He and Burns won't be adapting their accents for the U.S. run,
however. "The best way is just to leave it as is," he said. "If
people sit there silently, then maybe we'll need some changes."</TE>
<TE>   McElhinney suggests audiences will get it. "If we had done the
play 10 years ago, Irish references might have gone over American
heads, and American references over Irish heads," he said. "But it's
amazing how quickly that has changed. Internet, videos and DVD have
become the new literature, and we all know about each other."</TE>
<TE>   After San Diego, "Stones in His Pockets" moves to San Francisco,
Wilmington, Del., Hartford, Conn., and other cities, with the present
cast on contract through May.</TE>
<TE>   There have been preliminary talks about a Los Angeles run, perhaps
at the Mark Taper Forum, McElhinney said. A spokeswoman at the Taper
confirmed that the talks are preliminary, with 20 to 25 plays still
under consideration for next season, including "Stones in his
Pockets."</TE>
<TE>   Wherever it lands in the world, the director--whose knowledge of
the piece was intimate from the beginning--says people will see the
work as a mirror.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about us," McElhinney said. "Marie used muscular, poetic and
funny language to establish that pipe dreams can screw your head up
as well as enhance your future."</TE>

<HD>A Career of Epic Proportions</HD>
<DH>John Williams has taken knocks for his movie scores, but as
the composer turns 70, he isn't defensive. He enjoys film work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON BURLINGAME</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>J ohn Williams is a busy man. Almost too busy to notice his birthday.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the composer of "Star Wars" and "E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial" turns 70. He will not be commemorating the
occasion with, say, a quiet dinner for family and friends. Instead,
he'll be celebrating at a slightly bigger party: conducting the Utah
Symphony and the 350-voice Mormon Tabernacle in his new Olympic
theme, "Call of the Champions," at the opening ceremonies in Salt
Lake City before a worldwide television audience of, oh, a billion or
so.</LD>
<LD>   Just a week ago, he finished recording 110 minutes of music in
London for "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" (due May 16).
On Saturday, he will again conduct his Olympic music, and other
pieces, in the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. In three weeks,
he'll lead the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a special birthday
concert, with Yo-Yo Ma performing his Cello Concerto. A few days
before that, Sony Classical will release a new CD of that work and
several more performed by Ma.</LD>
<TE>   "Turning 70 doesn't feel any different than 40," Williams says.
His neatly trimmed beard is snow white now, as is most of his wispy
hair. "My schedule now is probably not any heavier than it's been for
the last 10 or 15 years," he adds. "Most of these commitments are
fairly long-standing, so I'm kind of in the rhythm of doing these
things."</TE>
<TE>   And doing them pretty well. Four of the top five money-making
films of all time, six of the top 10 and eight of the top 15 have
music by John Williams. With five Oscars (plus 34 nominations), four
Emmys and 18 Grammys, he's the most honored film composer currently
working in Hollywood. He is also the highest paid, with fees
reportedly exceeding $1 million a picture and the bonus of profit
participation on some, meaning extra money if the film is a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Which is a strong possibility. Besides the "Star Wars" movies and
"E.T.," think "Jurassic Park," "Home Alone," all three Indiana Jones
movies, "Saving Private Ryan" and "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone." Think "Jaws."</TE>
<TE>   Without its ominous shark theme, says the film's director, Steven
Spielberg, "'Jaws' would have been half as successful."</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg, who has worked with Williams on 17 films, describes
himself as "more awestruck by John today than I was when I first met
him." That was back in 1973, on his first feature, "The Sugarland
Express."</TE>
<TE>   "I've often made a fool of myself, hanging over his piano weeping
after he's played me something," says the director, referring to the
music for "E.T." and "Schindler's List."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Williams' career outside of Hollywood--as a
conductor, including 14 years at the helm of the Boston Pops, and as
a composer of serious music. He has written several concertos, a song
cycle, two symphonies, and assorted celebratory works, such as his
four Olympic themes. Despite some mixed reviews, the commissions and
conducting invitations continue to multiply.</TE>
<TE>   His friend Andre Previn, a composer who had his own bumpy
trajectory from the film business to the concert hall, just wishes
he'd concentrate more:</TE>
<TE>   "I keep telling him, 'For God's sake, stop writing for those
cornball movies and go be a composer.'</TE>
<TE>   "John is much too good a musician to stay satisfied with that
forever," Previn continues. "I hate to see him spend so much time
doing, you know, 'Home Alone' or whatever. It's so beneath him. But
it's a pointless argument, because he likes doing it, and he does it
very well."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' writing space looks exactly like a composer's study
should. Dozens of pages of musical sketches, neatly notated in
pencil, are scattered across the lids of two baby grand pianos with a
pair of drafting boards strategically placed around one bench.</TE>
<TE>   Ceiling-high bookcases on both sides of the room are jammed with
music books--biographies of the great composers, histories,
orchestration texts--and seemingly endless rows of leather-bound
scores. A portrait of George Gershwin, together with a canceled check
signed by the great American songwriter, is framed on one wall.
Williams has been writing music here since 1970, in a corner of the
Westwood home he shares with his wife, Samantha, of 21 years. (He has
three grown children by a previous marriage and five grandchildren.)</TE>
<TE>   It's the night before he is to leave for Boston, en route to his
London "Star Wars" recording dates; he still has to finish composing
the closing-credit music for "Attack of the Clones" and pack for the
trip. But the soft-spoken Williams shows no signs of strain, segueing
into philosophical asides and peppering his conversation with
references to T.S. Eliot, John Kenneth Galbraith and Virgil Thomson.</TE>
<TE>   On the question of the concert hall versus the movie theater, he's
conciliatory. "The gulf that's existed between the Hollywood music
community and our fine arts community has been deeper than any of us
would have liked," he says. But attitudes are changing, he believes,
and film composers are now more welcome in the concert hall than they
were 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Concert music, however, is not about to become his priority.</TE>
<TE>   "Although I enjoy working in the concert field enormously, I do
feel that it is in the area of film music that I can perhaps be most
contributive," he says mildly.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he just can't say no to certain projects. He loved the
book "Angela's Ashes," so he wanted to score the movie. He liked the
early-American period of "The Patriot," hence the desire to write
music for the Mel Gibson action film. He became enamored of J.K.
Rowling's books and so was pleased to set "Harry Potter" to music.
Decisions about which film to accept, he says, are made "on a
case-by-case basis."</TE>
<TE>   He is proud of most of the work that has made him a household
name. "It's wonderfully gratifying to think that I can go into a
concert and play 'Indiana Jones' or 'Superman' or even 'Schindler's
List' to people, and they'll know the music completely. It's
flattering and rewarding on the deepest level. And it speaks to the
power of film to bring music to an audience larger than any ever
imagined in the previous history of music."</TE>
<TE>   Williams speaks of "the challenges of concert music, the
opportunities of having great artists performing for a discerning and
sophisticated public." He adds with a smile that "there's a wonderful
sense of freedom in writing concert music which isn't there when we
look at a cue sheet [for a film] and know that we have to be off the
stage in three minutes and 10 seconds."</TE>
<TE>   Critics describe his concert works as mostly accessible, more
modern in idiom than the familiar romanticism of much of his film
music, and sometimes drawn on models ranging from Elgar to
Stravinsky. The New York Times found his bassoon concerto "slightly
less derivative than his film scores ... a comfortably familiar
stew," while the Boston Globe praised his song cycle "Seven for
Luck," based on the poems of Rita Dove, for its "flexible rhythms,
pungent harmonies and bold gestures."</TE>
<TE>   "When you start to write for film, you have a lot of help," he
explains. "You have a script, actors, an ambience, a texture, a time
and place. But when you write a purely abstract piece, you start out
with a lot less. You have to create that yourself, either through a
programmatic suggestion or through some other sense of design. Some
composers think about nature, some look at paintings--rarely is music
created in a complete vacuum. It's challenging at a different level
than film music."</TE>
<TE>   But, he insists, film work is no less creatively satisfying.
"Every time I look at a picture that's a new assignment, it's
daunting. It never seems easy. I think, 'Can I do this well?' I don't
think anyone [who composes for film] ever gets blase because we're
basically too insecure for that. It's like running a race for an
athlete; every single time is the toughest. It's still that way."</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg says he has been able to return to Williams over and
over for 30 years because of the composer's versatility. "John can
change his style based on his impressions of the movie that he's
about to write," he says, citing the melancholy of "Schindler's List"
and the sophistication of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."</TE>
<TE>   "Many people--I was one of them--misjudged him as a composer,"
Boston Symphony Orchestra music director Seiji Ozawa says on the
phone from Paris. The two first met when Williams arrived in 1980 to
take charge of the Boston Pops. "But I found out when I studied his
pieces. His knowledge and background and training, how he does his
music [demonstrates] a very high standard and deep musicianship."</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York, the son of Johnny Williams, a jazz drummer,
Williams moved to L.A. with his family in 1948, studying at Los
Angeles City College, UCLA and, back in New York, at Juilliard. He
began his career in 1955 as a studio pianist for conductors such as
Alfred Newman at 20th Century Fox and Morris Stoloff at Columbia.
(The "Johnny T. Williams" playing the jazz solos on Henry Mancini's
original 1958 "Peter Gunn" album is the future film composer.)</TE>
<TE>   "I began to be a little bit dissatisfied with the role of an
orchestra pianist," Williams recalls. He shifted first to
orchestration, for such composers as Adolph Deutsch ("The Apartment")
and Dimitri Tiomkin ("The Guns of Navarone"). He also arranged albums
for artists such as Frankie Laine and Mahalia Jackson. Then Revue
Studios (later Universal Television) placed Williams under contract
as a composer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a slow evolution from the piano bench to the podium," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Churning out weekly scores for hourlong dramas such as
"Checkmate," "Alcoa Premiere" and "Kraft Suspense Theater," he
learned the basics of crafting music for film. "Every week was a
different kind of challenge: a comedy, a western, a war film, a love
story, whatever. It was a great training ground," he says. He learned
to write music, often as much as 20 minutes a week, on demand, and to
conduct the studio musicians.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1960s, he was getting regular feature film assignments.
His first Oscar nomination was for adapting Andre and Dory Previn's
song score to the infamous 1967 "Valley of the Dolls"; his first
Oscar win was for the 1971 adaptation of music for the film version
of "Fiddler on the Roof."</TE>
<TE>   A growing reputation as a disaster-film specialist (with scores
for "The Poseidon Adventure," "Earthquake" and "The Towering
Inferno"), along with a clear facility for musical Americana ( scores
for "The Reivers" and "The Cowboys") prompted Spielberg's first
call--made Williams bankable.</TE>
<TE>   "Jaws," in 1975, sealed the deal. "I was very excited by that
film. I thought it was a great picture. I still do," says Williams,
whose music for it won an Oscar. But he wasn't able to enjoy it--his
first wife, singer-actress Barbara Ruick, had died the previous year
of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 43. "I was in a state of shock
that year and the year after, so when all of these accolades were
going on, I was barely aware of it," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   It was on Spielberg's recommendation that George Lucas hired
Williams for "Star Wars"--a decision that Lucas calls easily as
important to the film's success as casting or script.</TE>
<TE>   The score sold an unprecedented 4 million double albums, but, says
Williams, the "real result of that for me was the opportunity to
conduct the Boston Pops." He substituted for an ailing Arthur Fiedler
in 1978, and the Pops asked him to succeed Fiedler after his death in
1979.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Dyer, music critic for the Boston Globe, witnessed
Williams' growth as a conductor during his 14-year tenure at the
Pops. "I think John took the Pops job for a reason," Dyer says. "He
wanted to establish the 'musical legitimacy' of film music--and he
succeeded in that." He retired from the Pops in 1993 but is now its
laureate conductor, and he still spends every summer at Tanglewood,
summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, teaching, conducting
and writing.</TE>
<TE>   "The most significant thing in my life and development was that
the success of 'Star Wars' made it possible for me to be associated
with one of the greatest orchestras in the world," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Once his 70th birthday month is past, Williams' schedule doesn't
get any lighter. In March, he'll perform the "E.T." score live with
the film at the Shrine Auditorium; in March and April, he is slated
to compose the score for Spielberg's "Minority Report"; in May, he
conducts a series of concerts in Boston; and in the summer, there's
conducting at the Hollywood Bowl, in Cleveland and at Tanglewood. In
the fall, he plans to score Spielberg's next film, "Catch Me if You
Can," and possibly the next "Harry Potter" movie.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he will be pursuing the kind of work that Previn
and company are demanding.</TE>
<TE>   He is excited about a commission to write a horn concerto for Dale
Clevenger of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which is due in May
2003. Beyond that, he speaks of writing "a choral and orchestral
piece of a fairly extended nature"; a "large-scale piece for
orchestra"; another collaboration with Dove; and new pieces for Ma
and violinist Itzhak Perlman.</TE>
<TE>   Placido Domingo has announced that Williams will compose a work
for L.A. Opera, although Williams says he is reluctant: "I'm an
instrumental composer not a vocal composer." Ozawa too says he has
been "seriously pushing for him to write an opera" that Ozawa would
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Says Dyer: "Even when he's being a ventriloquist, as he sometimes
has to be as a film composer, I don't think he's ever written a
dishonest note. Like everybody else, some things worked out better
than other things did. But I don't think it's a mechanical process
for him. He can write music of heroic resolve because he feels heroic
resolve. He's drawing on his own inner life and creating additional
dimensions in the movies. And that's what makes the concert music
work too."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Williams is both modest and realistic about his
successes. "I've been fortunate in the assignments that I've been
given and in the collaborators with whom I've shared the stage," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "The more you work in music, the more years you spend with it, the
more in love with it you become," he adds. "It's not like a job
that's distasteful. It's the opposite of that--more seductive, more
interesting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long journey, a greatly rewarding one in every way,"
Williams says. "An almost always happy one, and a continuing one. I
don't feel any differently about the need to work, and to work well,
than I ever did. I don't feel any differently about challenging every
note I write any more now than when I was 35."</TE>

<DH>In Mali, where a portrait is an occasion, two photographers
recorded individual tastes as well as cultural history.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Images of Africa tend to come to us clouded by disaster--war, famine,
pestilence and, most recently, destructive rivers of lava in Congo.</LD>
<LD>   But another set of photographs provides a counterpoint to such
grim realities. "You Look Beautiful Like That: The Portrait
Photographs of Seydou Keita and Malick Sidibe," opening at the UCLA
Hammer Museum on Saturday, documents an Africa of proud families and
nattily dressed young men, of changing times and changing styles, of
life enjoyed rather than life endured.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm mainly interested in capturing joyful moments, joy and
pleasure," Sidibe told the show's curator, Michelle Lamuniere, in an
interview conducted November 2000. "I also like the idea of
photography as a means of creating memories.... People wanted these
images of themselves. It's a powerful urge that they can't always
explain or resist."</LD>
<TE>   Sidibe and Keita each ran their own portrait studios in Bamako,
capital of the West African country of Mali. Keita, who died in
November, started his business in the 1940s when Mali was still a
French colony. Sidibe opened up shop in the 1960s, a generation
later, as Mali became an independent state. Although both were
commercial photographers first, plying their craft on command, they
also captured the aspirations of a rising nation.</TE>
<TE>   In one Keita portrait from the early 1950s, a man is elegantly
dressed in a stiff white shirt and dark jacket, a jaunty bowtie at
his neck and a dapper kerchief in his breast pocket. He stares out of
fashionable horn-rimmed glasses, while his face shows the signs of
traditional scarification. "This attraction to Western fashion does
not reflect a longing to be Western, however," according to
Lamuniere, assistant curator of photography at the Fogg Museum at
Harvard, where the show originated, "but rather a wish to be
associated with contemporary trends and fashions."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 72 black-and-white images in the show, 44 are enlargements
made from the original negatives. Fourteen are vintage prints by
Sidibe--who proudly did his own darkroom work--in their original
postcard-sized format. The remaining 14, included to provide
historical context, are postcards and photographs taken throughout
West Africa by mostly European photographers at the turn of the
previous century.</TE>
<TE>   Lamuniere points out the contrasts between the work of Sidibe and
Keita, and the earlier shots, noting the stiff poses in the pictures
and the captions on the postcards.</TE>
<TE>   "When you add text to the portrait it tends to depersonalize it,"
she points out. "Keita and Sidibe's portraits were intended for
private use and have the potency of an intimate experience."</TE>
<TE>   Keita was born around 1921, Sidibe in 1935. Although there are
parallels in much of their work, their photographs also show the
social and economic changes Mali went through in the latter half of
the century.</TE>
<TE>   The way each became a photographer tells part of the story. Keita
got his start as a photographer when an uncle gave him a Kodak
Brownie camera. He was a furniture maker who taught himself to take
pictures on the side.</TE>
<TE>   Sidibe's training was more formal. He moved to Bamako to study
jewelry making at the School for Sudanese Craftsmen, now the National
Institute for Art, but after he graduated in 1955, he took a job with
French commercial photographer Gerard Guillat, learning via
apprenticeship.</TE>
<TE>   Keita set up his studio in the courtyard of his house, hung up a
bedsheet as backdrop and relied on available light, which accounts
for some of the high contrast and shadows in his pictures. Sidibe
opened his studio--with studio lighting--in a room so small that a
corner of the wall often appears in his pictures. "It's amazing what
he was able to do in that space," says Lamuniere, who has visited
there.</TE>
<TE>   Both photographers were so popular that during holidays--when many
would get new outfits--lines of people waited to have their picture
taken. Each has taken upward of 10,000 portraits.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, women come to get photographed as soon as they have a
new hairdo or purchase a trendy piece of jewelry: a bracelet, a
necklace, a handbag," Sidibe told The Times. "For men, it's when they
buy a new bicycle or motorcycle."</TE>
<TE>   For one 1962 photo, a man brought a sheep to Sidibe's studio; for
a 1974 photo, a tailor brought in a dress form decked out in a gown
he had made.</TE>
<TE>   If what the clients owned was not fine enough, the photographers
gladly provided costumes and props: a snazzy European suit, an
elegant wristwatch, or perhaps even a radio or motorcycle to convey
an image of modernity and affluence. The show's title is taken from a
phrase popular in Bambara, the language common in Mali, I ka nye
tan--presumably the reaction the sitter hoped for: "You look
beautiful like that."</TE>
<TE>   Each photographer also took plenty of family memento pictures. "In
Africa, photography is a way of recognizing the different stages of
your life," Sidibe says. "Photographs are memories that allow you to
follow the growth of your children."</TE>
<TE>   The photos pick up changes in fashion and style and cultural
mores. In one Sidibe shot from 1969, a woman chooses to get her
picture taken in a bathing suit. When Keita was working, such a
photograph would have been unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   There are also shifts in the expression and pose of the sitters.
"Keita was one of the first African portrait photographers in Mali,"
Lamuniere says, "so you see in [his] portraits greater formality. [At
the time] photography was a novelty, it was an event, so the sitters
took the portrait-making session with more seriousness, less gaiety
than Sidibe's sitters. By the time Sidibe was working, photography
was more ubiquitous, and you see his sitters taking a more active
role in how they wanted to define themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Keita closed his portrait studio in 1962, when he took a
photography-related job dealing with IDs for the newly formed
government. Sidibe, now in his late 60s, is still in business,
although it's more a part-time occupation now. In the last decade,
the work of both has been "discovered," resulting in exhibitions,
magazine assignments and a coffee-table book on each by Andre Magnin,
curator for the Contemporary African Art Collection, housed in Geneva
and founded by venture capitalist Jean Pigozzi, a Harvard alumnus.
(Most of the photographs in "You Look Beautiful" are from this
collection.)</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., Keita's work has been featured in shows at the
National Museum of African Art at the Smithsonian in 1996 and, in
recent weeks at the Sean Kelly Gallery in New York. Sidibe had an
exhibition of shots from social events, a sideline to his portrait
work, at Deitch Projects in New York in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Lamuniere's show is the first to add an academic imprimatur to the
material. "We were interested in bringing work of these two
photographers to a broader audience and doing something a little more
scholarly," she says, "looking at their work for formal qualities and
building a social context from which they came."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to the show in Boston and to the gallery exhibition in
New York has been favorable. "Keita was predisposed to strong
statements," wrote Vicki Goldberg in the New York Times. "No one in
his portraits melts into the background." Joanne Silver, writing in
the Boston Herald, noted that Sidibe's photos "radiate the warmth of
... connection [with the sitters]."</TE>
<TE>   While their photographs are treated as art overseas, their work
isn't prized the way it used to be at home. "Color photography has
really taken over," Lamuniere says, "so I think it has simplified the
traditions of portrait photography. Now, with all the technological
advances in photography, it's more of a snapshot mentality."</TE>
<TE>   Keita and Sidibe have made it clear that, at least at first, they
weren't trying to be artists, they were just trying to please
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, we work in order to earn our daily bread here," Keita
told Lamuniere. "Photography started out as a means to an end for me.
I never thought that there would be exhibitions."</TE>
<TE>   Sidibe echoed the thought: "[F]or an African photographer, getting
paid is the name of the game. We don't just pick up a camera for the
pure pleasure of it, you know--by and large, our work stems from an
economic need."</TE>
<TE>   Over time, he admitted, his attitude changed. "But that first
taste turned into a genuine hunger," he says, "and a real passion for
the art of photography was born."</TE>

<HD>He May Be the King, but He Shuns the Crown</HD>
<DH>A magazine named him Latin jazz royalty, but Poncho Sanchez
dismisses the furor that followed: His success speaks for itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a rookie on the congas, young Poncho Sanchez remembers hanging
around Griffith Park where groups of men gathered for drumming jam
sessions on Sunday afternoons. He was still in high school then, a
Chicano kid from Norwalk way out of his element.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez would get the nerve to approach the best players, the
Cubans and Puerto Ricans who carried this macho, Afro-Caribbean art
in their blood.</LD>
<LD>   "Can I sit in?" the kid dared to to ask.</LD>
<TE>   "Tu eres Cubano?" they shot back.</TE>
<TE>   No, Sanchez answered. He's neither Cuban nor Puerto Rican.</TE>
<TE>   An immediate disqualifier. The men wouldn't let him in the circle,
so he went to play with the amateurs under a tree.</TE>
<TE>   "Chicanos no saben tocar la conga," the men would say. "Chicanos
don't know how to play congas."</TE>
<TE>   Well, yeah, but they can learn. And that was Sanchez's goal.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Ildefonso "Poncho" Sanchez went on the become one of
the most successful Latin jazz bandleaders in the U.S. After playing
with Cal Tjader for eight years, he recorded 21 albums of his own,
earning four Grammy nominations and winning once. He plays
continually, locally and internationally.</TE>
<TE>   Just one problem. No matter how hard he works or how successful he
gets, Sanchez will never be Cuban. And some people still don't let
him forget it.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, an article in Jazz Times magazine dubbed Sanchez the new
king of Latin jazz. Nobody had laid claim to the throne since the
death almost two years ago of Tito Puente, the Puerto Rican New
Yorker whose career spanned more than half a century.</TE>
<TE>   "Heresy!" screamed some critics in the Big Apple. Nobody has a
right to the title. And especially not Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   "You're pulling my leg, right?" wrote a fan in Yahoo's Latin jazz
discussion forum. "There are lots of cats out there whom Poncho
Sanchez would have to stand behind in line before he received his
crown, if there were crowns to to be awarded."</TE>
<TE>   "I second that motion," wrote another critic. "Maybe the Karaoke
King of Congas."</TE>
<TE>   The nastiness rallied others to Sanchez's defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope that this has nothing to do with Poncho being
Chicano," wrote a fan named Chico. "This [garbage] has come up
before: 'Chicanos can't play this music,' or 'Why don't you play your
own music?' are ones I have heard."</TE>
<TE>   At his home in a working-class Norwalk neighborhood, Sanchez
dismissed the critiques as the petty jealousies of parochial rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost silly," said the burly, bearded musician, surrounded
by old records and wall-to-wall memorabilia. "I didn't say I'm the
king, and I never would say it.... I just love this music. This is my
life. But I'm not the king. No, no. How can a Chicano be the king of
Latin jazz? No, that's gotta be some other guy from New York crying
for a local gig for Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, they can have it, because I'm laughing all the way to my
concerts all over the world. You get the title, but I got the gigs."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy angered the bandleader's old friend Jose Rizo, a
fellow Mexican American who hosts "Jazz on the Latin Side" on KLON-FM
(88.1) in Long Beach. Rizo, a part-time concert promoter who recently
featured Sanchez at a Latin jazz show at Cal State L.A., says this
East Coast-West Coast rivalry deprives good artists of the credit
they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always left out, and that burns me," says Rizo, a pioneer
of Latin jazz radio in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez says he's worked hard for what he's achieved, so the
rejection stings a little. He's only human.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no revenge like success. Sanchez has done so well,
he's moving to a big new home with a swimming pool and a spa up on a
hill in nearby Whittier. At his old home, he was getting ready to
pack his CDs, his rare old records by his idol, Cuban drummer Mongo
Santamaria, and, of course, his Grammy.</TE>
<TE>   In one corner of his crowded music room, there's a collection of
brightly painted congas by Remo with a brand-name plaque on the side:
Poncho Sanchez Signature Series.</TE>
<TE>   His instrument endorsement and his consistent record sales are the
reason he can finally afford a nicer home.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to get peanuts before, but now I get real royalty checks,"
says Sanchez, the youngest of 11 children who moved here as a child
from Laredo, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The 50-year-old percussionist taught himself to play by watching
great drummers such as Puente, Tjader, Mongo and Joe Cuba when they
came to town. Then he'd go home and try to play along with their
records. Every day in his mother's garage, he'd practice to the
music.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody in his neighborhood listened to this stuff in those days,
except his older sisters, who played records and danced at home. His
friends all dug Jimi Hendrix and Vanilla Fudge, leaving Sanchez in a
world of his own.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez joined Tjader's band in 1974, playing his first gig with
the band on New Year's Eve at the Cocoanut Grove in the old
Ambassador Hotel. It's been nonstop ever since, despite the
naysayers.</TE>
<TE>   His consolation is the steady demand for his work, Sanchez says.
He opens a date planner and flips through the first few months of
2002, listing the places where he's already been booked: Seattle,
Istanbul, Caracas, Las Vegas and Sedona, Ariz., to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   "What am I worried about?" says Sanchez, closing the black
planner. "If there's some jealous musicians in New York, it don't
bother me. They can say all they want. They can say they're better
than me, as long as I'm not late to my next gig."</TE>

<HD>A High-Voltage Singer With Low-Key Plans</HD>
<DH>To reconnect with fans, Senegal's Baaba Maal has an
intimate set in mind for UCLA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baaba Maal's appearance at the Hollywood Bowl last summer was a tour
de force--a take-no-prisoners extravaganza that captivated his
ecstatic listeners. The veteran Senegalese singer-songwriter, one of
the most prominent of all African artists, led a 12-piece ensemble
through a brilliantly energetic presentation, filled with visual
color and body-moving rhythms.</LD>
<LD>   That's not exactly what will be happening Thursday, however, when
Maal returns to the Southland for a concert at UCLA's Royce Hall. As
he has done a number of times in the past, Maal will counter the
high-voltage sounds of what he describes as his "big band" ensemble
with an entirely different, considerably smaller group.</LD>
<LD>   "I needed to do an acoustic tour after the last album, 'Missing
You ... Mi Yeewnii,' which is more acoustic," Maal explains. "And I
also think people appreciate to see this other side of me and my
music also. It's also different in that it is very intimate, very
close to the people who come to see the show--something like an
African party, the kind of thing we do a lot in Africa, and it's a
lot of fun to share it here in this country."</LD>
<TE>   It's not likely that Maal's UCLA concert will completely capture
the atmospheric qualities of "Missing You," which was recorded in an
open-air setting, with the sounds of crickets and village life in the
background. But it's not surprising that he chooses, on a regular
basis, to contrast his galvanizing, big-venue performances with
appearances that allow a more direct connection with his listeners.</TE>
<TE>   Maal, 41, still lives a good part of the time in his hometown of
Podor in northeast Senegal. He seems to gain creative and spiritual
sustenance from casual, outdoor performances for audiences that have
known him for decades.</TE>
<TE>   His primary supporter in maintaining that connection with his
roots is a longtime friend, blind guitarist Mansour Seck, who, as
always, will be in the Maal ensemble at Royce Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "We started out together and learned a lot of things about
traditional music together, so he's a reference," Maal says. "I can
be wrong in a direction sometimes, but Mansour is always there to
remind me not to go far away from the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   The need to maintain touch with tradition is a continuing theme in
Maal's thinking. Like many African artists, he did a great deal of
recording in European studios in his early years. Although he managed
to remain firmly connected to his roots, the domination of Paris, in
particular, as a source of studio-generated Afro-pop tended to create
a genre of music that often had more to do with synthesized sounds
than with the creative ambience of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   But according to Maal, the last five years have seen a significant
change in that process as African promoters, producers and musicians
have begun to take charge of their music. Maal sees this shift taking
place not just in music, but in the panorama of African artistic
expression.</TE>
<TE>   "Starting in Africa, making CDs, concerts, even ballet and
movies--I think it's better to do it that way, because we have really
good elements, and it's a good thing to see them in their original
form," he says. "I also think that being there, recording it there,
is very important, because a lot of different things happen in
Africa; the whole continent is a social environment that affects the
music and the musicians."</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, the interplay between Africa and the West that
figures in Maal's music is present--in vastly different, considerably
more dramatic form--in the new film "Black Hawk Down." Vital to the
musical ambience are several songs by Maal.</TE>
<TE>   When he was asked to provide material for the picture, Maal was
pleased on two significant counts. The first had to do with the
visual qualities inherent to his musical tradition. Perhaps even more
important, Maal, an ardent advocate of world harmony, believed
strongly in the informative value of the picture.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there are some people in Africa who criticize what
happened in Somalia. But I'm someone who believes that we have to
talk about something when it happens; we have to use it as an example
to make it not happen again. To help people understand what we should
do. And if my music can help to make it more clear in the minds of
people, that's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   It's a belief that also has underscored Maal's work with the U.N.
Development Program as a spokesman on the issue of HIV and AIDS in
Africa. As Maal continues his battle--one he thinks is "getting just
a little better"--against AIDS, he, like many other Muslim artists,
is also dealing with the consequences of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. Asked about his feelings, he pauses for a few moments before
replying.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," he finally says, "I can only hope that this style of music
can help people deal with what happened. You know, Senegal is a very
special country. In religion, the people there are very open in their
minds. Muslims, Christians, animists all follow their own religion,
because there's a great deal of tolerance. I hope it can be an
example for the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Because people need something to believe in, something that can
go into their hearts and give them some hope," he continues, "I like
to believe that this traditional music can do that as well, that it
is true, that it comes from the heart, and that it goes to the heart.
It brings love, and people need love now."</TE>

<DH>Ryan Adams upholds the '70s songwriter tradition without
losing his identity. On the road with the sensitive rocker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>It's well into the midnight hour as singer-songwriter Ryan Adams sits
at the bar in a crowded music club, a cigarette in one hand and a pen
in the other. A couple of fans wander over to say how much they enjoy
his music, but he's not using the pen to sign autographs. Unperturbed
by the activity around him, Adams is writing a song.</LD>
<LD>   On one side of the page of the yellow legal pad he has scribbled
nine potential titles. On the other, he's got the opening six or
seven lines.</LD>
<LD>   For Adams, his fans like to say, writing is as easy as breathing,
and he's breathing easy these days. He bought the legal pad in New
York earlier in the day for the plane ride here, and he's already
written all or parts of five songs. That includes two during the
two-hour flight, two more during a six-hour recording session with
his band, the Pinkhearts, and now this one. It's anybody's guess how
many more he'll write in the 30-some hours before catching a plane to
Australia, where he'll do a few shows. This prolific output is
legendary among Adams' admirers. Besides the five albums he has made
since 1995, either with his old band Whiskeytown or on his own, Adams
has recorded enough material for four more albums, which he hopes to
release via the Internet or sell at shows within the year.</LD>
<TE>   The danger in this pace is getting caught up in the thrill of
turning out songs and losing the distinction between good ones and
bad ones.</TE>
<TE>   In Adams' case, I haven't heard a bad song yet, and a half dozen
of them are so hauntingly personal that they'll stick with you
forever. He can be as eloquent about his own pain--which has ranged
from romantic heartache to fast-lane excess--as he is in helping you
sort through yours. In one melancholy song from his 2000 album,
"Heartbreaker," he asks, "Why is it they always leave on the days
that you need them most?"</TE>
<TE>   Adams, who goes into this month's Grammy Awards with three
nominations, including best rock album, is a throwback to the '60s
and '70s when writers such as Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell
gave us songs as illuminating and artful as the best novels and
movies.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone raised on those artists, Adams' tuneful, sometimes
edgy, sometimes achingly beautiful music is a reminder of that
tradition. It helps explain why he has a legion of famous boosters,
from Elton John and Bono to Bonnie Raitt and Emmylou Harris.</TE>
<TE>   You get the feeling these artists and the admiring record
executives aren't just being fans but are also pulling for him. In
this age of mostly anonymous pop, they're hungry for music with the
sensitivity and heart of the singer-songwriter tradition. Of the many
bright young hopes who have emerged in recent years, including Rufus
Wainwright and Ron Sexsmith, Adams has generated the most momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Lost Highway Records President Luke Lewis, who went to high school
with one of Adams' influences, the late Gram Parsons, was an Adams
fan before he signed him to a solo contract last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew my generation would like this music," says Lewis, 55. "But
what really sold me was when my kids, who are 20 and 22 and are into
rap, responded to it. I felt a generational connection. Ryan is a bit
of a rebel ... a new breed. He was raised on punk, but he has a sense
of the songwriting tradition. Plus, he's got more energy than anyone
I've ever seen. It's like he is this shark and he knows if he ever
stops he'll drown."</TE>
<TE>   Most people probably haven't heard Adams' music unless they caught
him recently on "Saturday Night Live, where he sang "New York, New
York," a new song from his latest album. Singer-songwriters have a
hard time these days getting radio exposure in an era of gimmicky
hits, and that exposure is still the key to record sales. Adams' two
solo albums have sold only about 250,000 together.</TE>
<TE>   Yet you'd think Adams has been on the cover of Rolling Stone for
years the way he sweeps into his manager's office at Lost Highway
Records here, with an intensity and flair that remind you of the
young Dylan in "Don't Look Back."</TE>
<TE>   Besides talent, Adams has charisma to burn. When he walks through
the Nashville airport with his dark glasses and stylish black leather
jacket, every head turns.</TE>
<TE>   He even brings that electricity to the record company offices,
where everyone is used to stars.</TE>
<TE>   Since it opened last year, Lost Highway, part of media giant
Vivendi's Universal Music Group, has built a distinguished roster
that includes Adams, Lucinda Williams and Willie Nelson. The label
picked up 16 Grammy nominations last month, including five for the "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack and five more for "Timeless," a
Hank Williams tribute album that features Adams, Dylan, Beck, Keith
Richards and others singing songs by the greatest of all country
songwriters.</TE>
<TE>   Like many industry veterans, Adams' burly manager, Frank Callari,
who is also senior vice president of A&amp;R for the label, fills his
office with all sorts of pop culture artifacts, from a "Sopranos"
stand-up to vintage Richards photos.</TE>
<TE>   Adams quickly spots the latest addition to Callari's wall: a
French poster advertising the singer's latest album, "Gold." The U.S.
version of the poster shows Adams holding a wine bottle as he jumps
in the air, but in this one the bottle has been airbrushed out.</TE>
<TE>   "What's with that poster?" Adams asks.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to take out the wine bottle," Callari explains. "And in
France of all places."</TE>
<TE>   Adams smiles. He takes off the dark glasses, drops into a chair
and asks Callari about some upcoming dates in Australia. But he
doesn't ever quite settle down. It's as if there's no "off" button.
He always seems to be absorbing material for songs. Most of the
music, he says, is autobiographical, but the seasoning often comes
from watching people or hearing their stories.</TE>
<TE>   This restlessness may be an outgrowth of a singer-songwriter's
lifestyle. Adams spends so much time touring--as much as nine months
a year, mostly in the U.S. and Europe--that it's fitting that his
home base is an apartment in a New York building that once was a
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan once said that things were happening so fast around him in
the '60s, when he was turning out two albums a year, that he didn't
want to go to sleep at night because he was afraid he would miss
something. Adams is so hyperactive that he rarely gets more than
three or four hours of sleep.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to go forever/I just want to burn up hard and
bright," he declares in "Firecracker," a song from the "Gold" album.</TE>
<TE>   The encouraging thing about Adams is that he enjoys all the
attention and success. He wants to sell more records and he complains
sometimes about all the media chores, including interviews, but his
life is good and he knows it. He's not another tortured rock star.</TE>
<TE>   "Joyful" and "joyous" are the words two people close to him use
when asked separately to describe Adams. To make things even better
these days, the man who is known for heartbreak songs--the
"Heartbreaker" album focused on the painful breakup of a lengthy
relationship--is even in love again.</TE>
<TE>   Things weren't always so easy.</TE>
<TE>   Callari, a veteran manager who has worked with such varied artists
as the British techno-pop outfit New Order, country group the
Mavericks and shock rocker Marilyn Manson, was a fan of Adams' music
with Whiskeytown, so he was interested when he heard the singer was
looking for a manager in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   He was wary, however, having heard horror stories about Adams'
rebellious behavior, including kicking monitor speakers on stage,
singing songs backward during shows, or sitting in a bar down the
street when he was supposed to be performing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was just overwhelmed by all the attention he started
getting at 21 and was just doing what he thought a rock 'n' roll
rebel was supposed to do," Callari says, sitting at his desk. "He was
also probably drinking too much and probably druggin' too much.</TE>
<TE>   "On one hand, he was just having fun. But it was counterproductive
and it might ruin his career. So I told him I thought he was
brilliant and that I would like to work with him, but only if he
wanted to straighten out and get focused about his career. If he was
ready to get serious, I said I was in. He took a few days to think
about it. We got together a week later again and he said, 'I'm
ready.'"</TE>
<TE>   The rehearsal studio, just a few blocks from Nashville's famed
Music Row, is bigger than most of the clubs Adams played for years
with Whiskeytown, and it looks even larger when a photographer and I
arrive because the only people in the room, besides the band onstage,
are a sound engineer and an aide of the band.</TE>
<TE>   It's 5 p.m. and the musicians are warming up with an instrumental
jam. Adams is wearing a black leather jacket over his long-sleeve
shirt and flared jeans from the '70s--specifically from 1974, the
year of his birth. He finds them at specialty shops in L.A. and New
York. As part of his fascination with that year, he also has a 1974
guitar.</TE>
<TE>   After a half-hour, Adams steps to the microphone and begins
singing. I don't recognize the first couple of songs, but I don't
want to ask anyone the titles because musicians tend to be more
forthcoming in interviews if they think you are as obsessed with
their music as they are. If you don't instantly recognize a
song--even an obscure one--you can shatter the bond you are trying to
establish.</TE>
<TE>   When none of the next three songs is familiar, either, I turn
discreetly to the sound engineer, the person in the room I think is
least likely to relay my confusion to Adams. "No idea," he says with
a shrug. "You know how Ryan is.... They must be new."</TE>
<TE>   It's almost 6 p.m. before I recognize a song, and that's only
because Adams is leading a spirited rendition of "Ooh Las Vegas," a
Parsons tune. Adams is probably associated with Parsons, who died of
a drug overdose in 1973 at age 26, more than any other of his many
influences. That's partly because Whiskeytown was identified in the
'90s with the No Depression country-rock movement that included such
young bands as Son Volt, the Old 97's and Wilco.</TE>
<TE>   Although different in many respects, the groups all mixed the
sentimental strains of country music and the independence of rock in
ways that were largely pioneered by Parsons.</TE>
<TE>   Adams' "Oh My Sweet Carolina," from "Heartbreaker," echoes the
melancholy innocence of Parsons' "Hickory Wind." The fact that Adams
and Parsons share the same birthday (Nov. 5) only adds to the
comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   Adams' influences, however, also range from punk (he has tattoos
of two great L.A. punk bands, Black Flag and X, on his left arm) to
classic rock (Dylan and Young) to moody, confessional artists such as
Steve Earle and the late Jeff Buckley.</TE>
<TE>   After two mostly gentle solo albums, he's planning to record a
bluesy, Rolling Stones-type collection, somewhat along the lines of
"Sticky Fingers" or "Exile on Main Street." He hopes to have it in
stores by this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to have two huge acoustic songs, like 'Wild Horses' or
'You Can't Always Get What You Want,'" Adams says with his typical
enthusiasm. "Then I want to write a couple of really fun songs about
these fictitious characters ... so that the songs are not about me
all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his frequent derivativeness, there is a strong, convincing
sense of personal identity in Adams' music. Whether it's the suicidal
despair of "To Be the One" or the wistful optimism of "La Cienega
Just Smiled," Adams writes about such basic themes as loneliness and
yearning with the complexity of poetry and the bull's-eye directness
of pure pop music.</TE>
<TE>   "When Stars Go Blue" is a portrait of despair with the gently
unsettling feel of Roy Orbison's tales of emotional cul-de-sacs, with
imagery that is typically understated. Because of the "stars"
reference, it's easy to think Adams is simply employing the usual pop
vocabulary, filled with "stars" and "moons" and "Junes."</TE>
<TE>   But you miss much of the power of Adams' music if you don't look
for deeper meaning. "Think of the 'star' as someone hiding away in
her Beverly Hills mansion and not saying an awful lot," he says about
the song (from "Gold"). "Listen to the song again with that in mind
and see what you think."</TE>
<TE>   About 90 minutes into the rehearsal, Adams suddenly sets down the
guitar, takes a pen from his pocket and picks up the yellow pad.
Sitting on the stage, he's in his writing mode. After a few minutes,
he moves to a sofa across the room. The band members know this may
take some time and they disperse around the room.</TE>
<TE>   By 7 p.m., Adams is back onstage with the band, trying to put
together an instrumental frame for his words. One line is so
striking--something about being "strung out on Christmas lights/Out
there in the Chelsea nights" that I jot it down in my notebook.</TE>
<TE>   Adams may have the dynamics of a star, but not the grating
attitude of some of them. He's unassuming around the band, which he
assembled from a group of his friends. Rather than go out to a trendy
restaurant to be seen, he has food brought into the rehearsal studio
for the dinner break and sits cross-legged in a corner as he digs
into a chicken salad with a plastic fork.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Jacksonville, N.C., Adams had what he describes as a
comfortable childhood. His dad is a contractor, his mother a teacher.
He loved skateboarding and punk rock as a youngster, dropped out of
high school at 15 and later moved to Raleigh to start a band, Patty
Duke Syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving school wasn't a case of bad grades. Adams simply felt he
wasn't getting anything out of his English classes. His mother had
introduced him to Emily Dickinson when he was 9, and he has continued
to read religiously. He especially likes Southern authors and
playwrights, such as Eudora Welty and Tennessee Williams.</TE>
<TE>   After discovering country music in his late teens, Adams put
together Whiskeytown in 1994, and the group released its debut album,
"Faithless Street," a year later on Mood Food Records. The band was
soon picked up by Outpost Records, which was affiliated with
powerhouse Geffen Records. Sales were minimal, but critics toasted
the band, so it was a heady time.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a rough time being a rock personality at 21," he says
during the dinner break. "As you get older, I think your survival
muscles get bigger. You are able to fend off more self-deprecating
feelings and inadequacies that make you want to go out and get
trashed.</TE>
<TE>   "You see enough people letting their addictions get ahead of them
or becoming disenchanted with their life because things aren't going
their way that you realize screwing up doesn't seem to be an answer
any longer."</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, Adams had moved to New York and was well into the
relationship whose breakup is chronicled in "Heartbreaker." In
reviewing the album, England's Q magazine called the collection "an
emotional outpouring, by turns tender and raw." Elton John was so
moved by "Heartbreaker" (which he called the most beautiful album of
the year) that he dedicated his latest album, "Songs From the West
Coast," to Adams.</TE>
<TE>   When I spoke to Adams in Los Angeles in December, he still carried
the emotional bruises of that New York relationship. He dated Winona
Ryder after the breakup, but says that they both realized the timing
was off--that it was a classic rebound relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually enjoy being by myself," he said. "I'm sometimes bad
around people because I just don't have a lot to say. I'm inward. I
love to people watch ... on a plane, in a restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   Things have changed a month later in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   He started seeing someone in New York, he says, and he's clearly
excited. Just the night before, he says, he was planning to go out to
a club, but the two decided to stay in and watch a movie on
television.</TE>
<TE>   "Leona and I are even going to be playing music together on the
road, which takes care of one problem of being a musician ..." he
says, then suddenly stops himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we shouldn't mention her name," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Adams was distressed when the identity of the woman in the
"Heartbreaker" relationship--a record industry publicist--was
identified by a music publication, so he's wary of naming names.</TE>
<TE>   But he can't help himself--she's singer-songwriter Leona Naess,
who has released two albums on MCA.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, go ahead and use her name," he says, shrugging. "As soon as
we start doing shows together, I'm sure everyone will realize what's
going on." (Adams and Naess will be at the El Rey Theatre in Los
Angeles on Feb. 25.)</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, Adams is absorbed in talking about his
unreleased albums when he suddenly hears a melody being played across
the room by his guitarist, Bucky Baxter, who has toured with Dylan
and Earle.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey Bucky, play that again," Adams shouts. "That's beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Adams tries to refocus on the conversation, but he can't resist
picking up a guitar and joining Baxter in the song. Soon, they are
back onstage and Adams is putting words to the music. Not all the new
lyrics are spontaneous, he later says. They sometimes float around in
his head for weeks before he calls on them.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like him" Baxter says later. "It reminds
you of these chess matches where people have to play against a timer.
It's like Ryan always has this timer in his head, and he's racing to
get another song."</TE>
<TE>   After the rehearsal, the band reassembles at the 12th and Porter,
a club not far from the original Grand Ole Opry building. Adams moved
to Nashville after the breakup of the "Heartbreaker" relationship and
frequents the 12th and Porter because he likes the atmosphere and the
bartender's vodka specialties.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as he arrives, he checks out the band in the music room
but leaves after one number. The group's country-rock sound is as
anonymous as most of the stuff you hear on the radio, which is one
reason record company scouts have started coming around.</TE>
<TE>   Thoughtful singer-songwriters tend to have such a difficult time
getting radio airplay because stations devote most of their playlists
to records with an immediate hook that draw listeners quickly.
There's not much of a market for music with the nuance or character
that requires your attention. A few female singer-songwriters,
notably Alanis Morissette and Sarah McLachlan, have made
breakthroughs in recent years, but male writers have been largely
shut out of mainstream playlists.</TE>
<TE>   Adams heads for the bar with bassist Billy Mercer, his best friend
in his group. The two look so much alike that they could be brothers.
To break the boredom of a series of lip-sync TV performances in
Europe last fall, the pair even switched roles during one British
show.</TE>
<TE>   "We just changed identities for the day," Adams says, still
enjoying the joke. "We switched wallets and money and caps. I also
had this wrapping on my hand because I broke a finger in Los Angeles,
and Billy wore the cast. Nobody knew the difference."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, except for Paul McCartney, who was also on the show,"
Mercer injects. "He came up to me afterward and said, 'You're not
Ryan Adams.' I've got no idea how he knew we had made a switch. I
also felt kinda bad because a couple of people asked me for
autographs, so they think they have Ryan's autograph when they have
mine. But I did get a chance to meet Paul McCartney, so it was cool."</TE>
<TE>   Adams stays at the bar, jotting thoughts on the legal pad for
nearly an hour, then heads outside, presumably for some fresh air.
When I follow a few minutes later, however, he's leaning against a
light post, talking on a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I did the song about us tonight with the band, and it sounded
great," he says excitedly into the receiver. He's talking to Naess,
and he's so happy that he hands me the phone to say hello.</TE>
<TE>   It's almost 1:30 a.m., still early by Adams time. The club has to
stop serving liquor at 3, but he's such a regular that it lets him
stay around as long as he wants, which is 5 a.m. some nights. Then he
heads back over to the hotel, where he has a typewriter waiting in
case he feels another song coming on.</TE>
<TE>   What about the future?</TE>
<TE>   "If Ryan had come along in 1973 when singer-songwriters were the
rage, he would have hit a home run commercially," Lost Highway's
Lewis says. "Will it happen now? I don't know. I'd like to think
there is a sea change going on out there--that people are ready for
singer-songwriters again."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Adams is taking nothing for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel pretty well taken care of. If all this stuff stopped
tomorrow, I'd still play guitar and record songs on a four-track
machine somewhere, or maybe try to write short stories full time."</TE>
<TE>   One thing in his favor is that he seems well past the time when he
could blow his career by getting caught up in the romantic image of
the rock 'n' roller or the singer-songwriter.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I was quite shy as a teenager, so it's weird that I decided
to do this," he says at the rehearsal hall. "I've only recently
broken out of my shell. I was really uncomfortable in my own skin
during my early 20s so I took refuge in that romantic tradition of a
songwriter, especially in this town.</TE>
<TE>   "I've taken girls down to the Ryman Auditorium [the original home
of the Grand Ole Opry] and leaned them right up against the wall and
made out with them, blaring drunk on whiskey. Talk about walking in
Hank Williams' footsteps. That was me. But you eventually get past
that."</TE>
<TE>   Two days, another rehearsal and five more new songs later, Adams
and the band are at the Nashville airport for the flight to
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The pace has finally caught up with him.</TE>
<TE>   While the band members sit around waiting for the boarding call,
Adams is asleep on the floor, the yellow legal pad and his cell phone
tucked in his carry-on bag.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adams on Disc</TE>
<TE>   Here's a guide to Ryan Adams' body of work--three albums with the
band Whiskeytown and two collections on his own:</TE>
<TE>   Whiskeytown</TE>
<TE>   "Faithless Street" (1995, Mood Food Records, re-released with
bonus tracks on Outpost Records). This is a delightful debut. The
influence of country-rock visionary Gram Parsons overflows, but
several tracks--including "Too Drunk to Dream" and "If He Can't Have
You"--have soulful, wistful edges that would have made them right at
home on Parsons' classic albums with the Flying Burrito Brothers.
Because the bonus tracks include early versions of some songs that
appear on "Perfect Strangers," the reissue is the Whiskeytown album
that should be of most interest to anyone new to Adams' work.</TE>
<TE>   "Perfect Strangers" (1997, Outpost). The production touches by Jim
Scott are more polished than those on the debut, putting the tone
closer to the streamlined country-rock sound of the Eagles than the
more ragged one of Parsons and the Burritos. Adams is developing
swiftly as a writer. In "16 Days," an edgy song about romantic
separation, he talks about being left with "a bottle and a rosary."</TE>
<TE>   "Pneumonia" (2001, Lost Highway). Although the album was finished
by 1999, its release was held up because Outpost went out of business
during the industry mergers of the late 1990s. Moving from the shadow
of Parsons, Adams continues to assert his independence as a writer
and singer. The lyrics are more personal and carefully crafted.</TE>
<TE>   Solo</TE>
<TE>   "Heartbreaker" (1999, Bloodshot). Adams makes his solo debut, and
there's no turning back. He brings such swagger to several tracks
that he reminds you of the young Bob Dylan--especially on "To Be High
(Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High)." The album centers on the breakup of
Adams' first serious relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Gold" (2001, Lost Highway). If you only get one Adams album, this
is the one. The themes are more varied than on "Heartbreaker" and the
writing is more eloquent. Influences still abound, from Steve Earle
to the Rolling Stones, but Adams weaves them into a style that is
convincingly his own.</TE>

<AU>EMORY HOLMES II</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maura Tierney arrives a few moments late for an interview and steps
to the curb just as the morning traffic on Larchmont Boulevard
momentarily dies down. It's a jaywalker's dream, but Tierney
hesitates, contemplating the infraction tentatively. As the traffic
revives, she walks half a block to the crossing, where a few
pedestrians are waiting for the light.</LD>
<LD>   The actress, whose 37th birthday is today, has won recognition for
her role as a nurse on "ER," yet she hardly seems a star. She wears
her dark, shoulder-length brown hair in a ponytail and is dressed in
loose-fitting vintage '60s blouse and pants, Birkenstocks and
sunglasses. L.A. residents are famous (and ridiculed) for their
reluctance to flout jaywalking laws, but "it was my Boston Irish
Catholic upbringing" that stopped her, she explains.</LD>
<LD>   The comment seems ironic considering Tierney's ardent portrayal of
Pat McBeth, the driven, dutiful, murderous wife who is the
centerpiece of first-time writer-director Billy Morrissette's dark
comedy, "Scotland, PA.," which opens Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Based--quite faithfully so--on Shakespeare's "Macbeth,"
Morrissette's reimagining of the Bard's tragedy as a comic farce was
not the easiest concept to sell, as Tierney readily admits. "It
sounds like a terrible idea when you tell people, 'Oh it's "Macbeth,"
and it takes place in rural Pennsylvania in the '70s in a fast-food
restaurant, and it's a comedy.' People go, 'Hmmm ...'" Tierney
giggles at her mental picture and concludes, "It's a hard pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Shakespeare remains remarkably popular as source
material among contemporary filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   According to the production notes, "Scotland, PA." joins more than
180 film adaptations of Shakespeare stretching back to 1900 when
Marrice Clement premiered "Hamlet" at the Paris Exhibition. More
recent productions have unfolded in teen hangouts and high schools,
including Baz Luhrmann's "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"
(1996), which is set on a Miami-like Verona Beach and stars Leonardo
DiCaprio and Claire Danes, and Tim Blake Nelson's "O" (2001), an
update of "Othello" starring Mekhi Phifer as a love-struck
high-school basketball star. (PBS' "Masterpiece Theater" last week
aired an "Othello" that retold the story of the Moor of Venice as a
descent into madness by John Othello, London's first black police
commissioner. In 2000, director Michael Almereyda cast Ethan Hawke as
the gloomy head of Denmark Corp. in his version of "Hamlet."</TE>
<TE>   And there have been at least 16 adaptations of "Macbeth,"
including Akira Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood" (1957), which placed the
action in medieval Japan, and William Reilly's "Men of Respect"
(1991), a mobster thriller.</TE>
<TE>   Tierney and Morrissette were aware many hard pitches had preceded
theirs. Morrissette, 39, Tierney's husband of nine years, said in a
later interview, "I had seen all that Kenneth Branagh stuff, and I
love that 'Romeo + Juliet' thing, but it's not the same. They're
speaking just words. After I wrote it, I had seen, '10 Things I Hate
About You,' and I didn't care for it. I thought they went a little
too far, you know, 'Taming of the Shrew' in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Although he took great liberties with the characters and setting,
Morrissette claimed it was not difficult to remain true to the spirit
of the text. "Being faithful to Shakespeare wasn't hard," Morrissette
said. "Banco was a little slow because I remembered a guy in college
who played Banquo, and I thought he was a little slow. So maybe I
added a few of those things. But it came very, very naturally because
these characters were all so involved in themselves. Malcolm and
McDuff's characters in the play are exactly what I did in the movie;
it's all just Shakespeare." (Morrissette's spellings diverge from the
originals of Macbeth, Macduff and Banquo, in part as a play on the
name of a certain fast-food chain.)</TE>
<TE>   Even if interpreting Shakespeare ultimately wasn't a problem, the
process of writing was another matter. "I can't tell you enough how
much I am not a writer," Morrissette confides. "I was an actor for 12
years, and I had no intention of being a writer--ever." Morrissette
said he conceived the idea for the film more than 20 years ago, back
in his hometown of South Windsor, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 16 and worked at Dairy Queen, and I hated my boss. I had
read 'Macbeth' that same year and started telling people that this
play would be hysterical if it took place in a fast food restaurant
and everyone in the restaurant is named Mac. Nobody cared, of course.
The idea went away, and I became an actor and in one bad year, as I
was driving through L.A. on my way to a commercial audition, I heard
something about 'Macbeth,' like, twice on the radio on NPR--two days
in a row. It was like a premonition. My old joke and the Dairy Queen
came into my head, and I thought, 'Oh, I should get a computer and
try to write that.'"</TE>
<TE>   When Morrissette shared his idea with friends, their eyes glazed
over. "One of my friends said, 'Yeah, you've got a nice story here,
but I'd cut this whole 'Macbeth' thing." Tierney was a believer,
however, and she and a few other friends encouraged him. "I really do
believe that writing and directing are Billy's true talents," Tierney
says. "He was so frustrated as an actor, and he had stopped working
and was getting [lousier] parts and then he decided to do this. And
as a result, I think he's really found what his gift is. Now, he
loves to write, and the characters he creates, he told me he gets
little crushes on all of them."</TE>
<TE>   "Scotland, PA." imagines "Macbeth" not merely as a story about
unbridled greed and ambition, but above all as a story about a
likable couple, deeply, madly in love, for which homicide just
happens to become a convenient career tool.</TE>
<TE>   Tierney was not Morrissette's initial choice for the role of the
killer housewife, Pat McBeth. "That's the most horrible thing, and
Maura knows this," Morrissette says, "but from the beginning I was
thinking the role would be a wacky Holly Hunter-type thing." One day
as he was working on the script in his study, Tierney was doing
chores in the kitchen nearby. "She hit her hand or something" and let
loose a burst of extremely colorful language, Morrissette recalls,
"which is the way she talks. And all of a sudden it was obvious. From
then on, I started writing the role for the Maura Tierney whom I knew
and loved. There are a couple of lines like that in the film that are
her actual lines."</TE>
<TE>   To prepare, Tierney studied several of the definitive filmed
performances of Lady Macbeth, especially the work of Jeanette Nolan
in Orson Welles' 1948 version and the work of Francesca Annis, who
performed the role in Roman Polanski's 1971 movie. Gradually, she
opted for an interpretation that was more faithful, not to
Shakespeare, but to her husband's original material.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally decided to stick to Billy's script," she explains,
"because he wrote a very complicated and complex and interesting
character in Pat McBeth. And I began thinking that if I thought too
much about, 'Oh I'm gonna be playing Lady Macbeth,' I would have
freaked myself out. So I tried to play only Pat."</TE>
<TE>   Tierney describes the character as "a lady who just wants a washer
and dryer, but who believes she is due certain things from life. The
movie takes place in the '70s ... [and] in those days, the way a
woman got real power was through her man," Tierney says.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone asked me, 'Why doesn't she leave him?' And I'm, like ...
(a) she loves him, and (b) he's gonna make it happen for her. In her
mind, that's how it works." Tierney decided "the McBeths, and
especially Pat, don't consciously think they've done anything wrong.
Which is why Pat goes nuts ... the guilt eats at her and drives her
crazy, but I don't know if it's at a conscious level. To express
this, Billy wrote what I think is one of the best lines in the movie:
'We're not bad people; we're just underachievers trying to make up
for lost time.'"</TE>
<TE>   Morrissette cast James LeGros ("Living in Oblivion" and the series
"Ally McBeal") in the pivotal role of Joe "Mac" McBeth, the homicidal
short-order cook. Tierney and LeGros' complimentary performances
amount to a cinematic duet.</TE>
<TE>   "The audience has to see that these two people love each other,
otherwise you ain't going to care for these people," Tierney says. "I
mean, that's what they have going for them--how much they love each
other." Adds Morrissette, "I have loved James' work and talked about
him for years. I knew that he could bring things to the role of
McBeth that might be missing from the script."</TE>
<TE>   After Morrissette completed the script in 1998, he and Tierney
looked for funding. "Maura had met a producer on something, and he
took it immediately," Morrissette recalls. "I was very paranoid about
the guy and rightly so. We lost a year and three months because he
just held onto it. That was the ugly road to Hollywood, where people
just take your work and option it and sit on it and don't do
anything. I went crazy." Tierney remembers, "It just kept not
happening and not happening. We had no control and were frustrated.
So finally we said, 'Give us the script back.' And Billy said, 'I'm
gonna do it!'"</TE>
<TE>   Morrissette says, "The twist is, after that, we got our very good
friend Richard Shepard ['Mexico City,' 'Oxygen'] to produce it. He
had it for a month or two, and all of a sudden we had the money."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually cinematographer Wally Pfister ("Memento"), costume
designer David Robinson ("The Phantom of the Opera") and veteran
actors such as James Rebhorn ("The Talented Mr. Ripley") and
Christopher Walken became attracted to the project.</TE>
<TE>   Of Walken's comic turn as the vegetarian detective, McDuff,
Tierney quips, "I don't know what drew him to the material. But I'm
glad something did."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Dick, a friend from Tierney's days on the NBC sitcom
"NewsRadio" (1995-99), also turns in an important cameo as one of
three stoned-out, trouble-making spirits whom only McBeth can see.
"Andy did us a favor because we sort of asked him to be in it,"
Tierney recalls. "He was a freaky joy," Morrissette adds.</TE>
<TE>   There was one potential crisis the couple had not anticipated: the
strain the filmmaking process might put on their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, not only did I never write before, I had certainly never
directed and I was sure that it was going to end the marriage,"
Morrissette says. "I met Maura Tierney 10 years ago at the revolving
lounge of the Hollywood Holiday Inn, on the first day I arrived in
L.A., and I now was sure we were going to kill each other and it
would be a mess. It was stupid of me because what happened was, it
was so simple, we both cared about the project so much and worked so
hard together."</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Tierney was nervous because "Billy had never
directed even a short film before, and it was really scary. We were
both nervous, but I was more nervous for him than I was for me. I
wasn't like, 'Oh no, I don't want my husband to direct me.' It was
sort of like, 'Do you think you can do this?'</TE>
<TE>   "No one else was going to cast me in this role. I felt it was a
big opportunity for me to do something really different. So both of
us really wanted to get it right and do a good job. We were a team in
that. I don't think we really realized the possibilities for conflict
until we were done."</TE>

<HD>News Still Counts at CNN. So Do Stars.</HD>
<DH>After a year of turmoil and triumph at the cable network, a
new policy seems to be in place. Will it be enough now that it's
slipped to No. 2?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At 9:50 a.m. on a recent Thursday, the New York control room for
CNN's "American Morning With Paula Zahn" was in a minor tizzy, and it
wasn't about the promotional campaign snafu that called Zahn "sexy."</LD>
<LD>   This debate was more prosaic. The news network had switched to
live coverage of closing arguments in the "hockey dad trial," and the
lawyers wouldn't stop speaking before Zahn was supposed to sign off.
Would viewers be confused if Zahn wasn't there when CNN switched back
to the studio? Would they even notice or care? Everyone in the room
had an opinion.</LD>
<LD>   At the old CNN, where everyone and everything was interchangeable,
no one would have thought twice about shuffling in a new anchor. The
new CNN, by contrast, cares deeply--and decided to put run a graphic
informing viewers that Zahn's show was ending, inviting them back the
next morning.</LD>
<TE>   In announcing the hiring of Connie Chung from ABC News last month,
CNN says its strategy is now clear: well-defined programs and
straight news from the likes of stars such as Zahn, Chung and Aaron
Brown; conversational talking heads that actually talk, not shout.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone is buying it. Some longtime staffers, schooled in
CNN's old "news is the star" philosophy, are chafing at the emphasis
on personalities. And although CNN News Group Chairman Walter
Isaacson insists that his competition includes NBC's "Friends" and
other channels of all genres, the media world has fixated on the
battle between CNN and the Fox News Channel, which surpassed CNN in
January to become the most-watched cable news network for the first
time on a month-long basis.</TE>
<TE>   Rejecting Fox's model of straight news laced with renegade
reporters such as Geraldo Rivera and an evening lineup of opinionated
talk, Isaacson envisions a CNN where a viewer can turn on the channel
at any time and find objective journalists "who are not just reading
teleprompters at you anymore, who are not just shouting at you ...
normal people you'd want to sit next to and have conversations with."</TE>
<TE>   That's the "thread that pulls it all together," he says, the "core
mission" that will help CNN survive in a universe of 300 channels.</TE>
<TE>   But is that really enough? And can CNN resolve its internal tug of
war without losing substantial ground to the competitive forces any
established entity faces in an increasingly crowded media world?</TE>
<TE>   It has clearly been a year of deep lows and exhilarating highs for
CNN. In January 2001, about 400 people, or 10% of its staff, were
laid off amid yet another management shakeup and stern pronouncements
that correspondents had better get used to a stripped-down future:
lugging their own gear, shooting their own video, and filing reports
for radio and the network's Web site in their spare time. Competition
was closing in, and the future seemed bleak.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of 2001, however, CNN was basking in its highest
ratings in five years, the surge a result of the Sept. 11 attacks and
subsequent war on terrorism. If the story didn't again put CNN front
and center as fully as the Gulf War had a decade ago, the overseas
component nonetheless played to CNN's strength--its vast worldwide
ties, with 30 foreign bureaus--allowing the channel to score some
journalistic coups. CNN's had a leg up this past week, for example,
because it has a bureau in Lagos, Nigeria, where an explosion was
estimated to have killed thousands.</TE>
<TE>   CNN executives have been heartened by the positive response to
Zahn and Brown--an ABC News alumnus--and were slapping high-fives
with the recent announcement that Chung, a former co-anchor of the
"CBS Evening News," was also leaving ABC for CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the dizzying changes during the year have not been without
setbacks. Employees felt buffeted as top management changed
repeatedly. In March, WB Network Chairman Jamie Kellner was appointed
to oversee CNN, along with other basic cable networks owned by AOL
Time Warner. Chairman Tom Johnson left, then President Phil Kent,
with Isaacson arriving from Time Inc. in July.</TE>
<TE>   Even as it was smartly tackling some of its most persistent
problems, CNN continually made missteps. A much-needed overhaul of
CNN Headline News, for example, was overshadowed last summer by the
hiring of former "NYPD Blue" actress Andrea Thompson, whose limited
news credentials--combined with the nude photos of her circulated on
the Internet--raised questions about exalting style over substance.</TE>
<TE>   While CNN garnered praise when the U.S.-led war on Afghanistan got
underway, the network also appeared to overplay its hand--trying to
claim pictures of the bombing as an exclusive and drawing howls of
protest from other networks. More recently, CNN's top-rated
personality, Larry King, renewed his contract--as everyone expected
despite hints he would go elsewhere--but the network was embarrassed
when King or someone close to him leaked highly inflated salary
figures.</TE>
<TE>   There has also been a wholesale house-cleaning--some voluntary,
some not--of much of the on-air talent that embodied CNN for two
decades, from lead anchor Bernard Shaw to entertainment reporter Bill
Tush and style maven Elsa Klensch. More than a dozen longtime CNN
names have left, including Bobbie Battista, Lou Waters, Natalie
Allen, Joie Chen and Frank Sesno.</TE>
<TE>   In a perceived coup for the network, Lou Dobbs returned and
revitalized CNN's business programming franchise, and several
old-timers remain, among them Wolf Blitzer, Bill Hemmer and Judy
Woodruff. Still, many find themselves playing a supporting role to a
flurry of new hires from ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, even MTV.</TE>
<TE>   With all the promotion for new faces such as Zahn and Brown,
insiders speak of an internal rift between the old and new guards. To
underscore the point, CNN's internal computer bulletin board recently
filled with bitter postings complaining about the low-key Brown and
his staff, referring to "Bore-man" (a play on the name of executive
producer David Bohrman) and grousing that the newcomers should have
more respect for the veterans. Before Greta Van Susteren recently
bolted for Fox News, her husband (who doubles as her lawyer) wrote a
widely circulated memo griping that Van Susteren wasn't getting
enough attention, with executives not going to bat to secure her a
White House Christmas party invitation, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   An emphasis on presentation, not just the news, has some both
inside and outside of CNN worrying that there's too much fluff, that
entertainment values are taking over. Given the millions spent luring
talent from other networks--with Chung, Zahn and Brown all said to be
earning low-seven-figure salaries--critics not surprisingly seized on
the quickly pulled ad for Zahn describing her as sexy. Even if top
executives didn't know about the promotion, some suggested, it still
came from an employee who thought that kind of approach was the
mandate.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's impossible to please everyone, there are also those
within CNN at the other end of the spectrum, wondering if the network
is doing enough to address the head-on challenge from Fox, whose "We
report, you decide" slogan is a not-so-subtle appeal to those
conservatives who accuse CNN of harboring a liberal bias.
Specifically, it's unclear whether there is enough of an audience
during news lulls to sustain the network without adopting a Fox-like
strategy that draws more freely on talk and opinion, playing to the
talk-radio audience.</TE>
<TE>   While CNN's ratings spiked far ahead of Fox in September and
October, Fox has come roaring back as the war news has died down. In
just-released January ratings, Fox, which in the last year
dramatically increased the number of cable systems on which it is
available, passed CNN to become the most-watched news network,
averaging 656,000 viewers on a 24-hour basis, versus 596,000 viewers
for CNN.</TE>
<TE>   "Fox's momentum is accelerating and CNN's is decelerating," says
Erik Sorenson, president of MSNBC, which runs third among the
all-news channels in the ratings race.</TE>
<TE>   A sure-fire way to enrage CNN executives these days, in fact, is
to compare the network with Fox. Isaacson went out of his way at the
Chung news conference to avoid criticizing Fox by name, but the
message was clear.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to be entertaining," one CNN executive, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said recently about Fox. "It's a lot harder
to compete with 20 years of trust and credibility. The niche we hold
is almost impossible for them to compete in."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for CNN, that hasn't stopped Fox from muddling CNN's
attempts to distance itself from the news channel wars.</TE>
<TE>   While Zahn and her team are doing interviews or discussing the
day's headlines in a segment called "The Buzz," for example, the crew
at "Fox and Friends" has been known to discuss ... Zahn. One of the
show's regulars, a radio deejay who goes by the name Mancow, recently
criticized Zahn at length, calling her a phony for changing her
opinions, then announcing, "I just want to punch her in the face."</TE>
<TE>   Fox, says Sorenson, is "doing something historically
unprecedented, talking about the competition on the air all the
time." It's not necessarily wrong, he says, "just startling.... You
don't hear Tom Brokaw talking about Dan Rather. It's a new level of
competitiveness."</TE>
<TE>   When CNN approached Zahn about joining CNN once her contract
expired in 2002, Fox promptly fired her and sued her agents. CNN
executives had been conflicted about Van Susteren for months, but
when her show blossomed into CNN's second-highest-rated of the
evening, Fox promptly snatched her away, as it did reporter Steve
Harrigan when CNN dallied on giving him a new contract.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has been equally aggressive in the war of words. "Part and
parcel of CNN's problem is they don't know what they want to be or
who they want to compete with,'' says Kevin Magee, vice president of
programming at Fox News. "Jamie Kellner is the Hollywood guy and
Walter Isaacson is the journalism guy, and the troops over there are
not sure who's the general. That's why you see them in fits and
starts lurching after us."</TE>
<TE>   As for the CNN strategy toward straight journalism, he points out
that two recent CNN hires "were the MTV woman [Serena Altschul] and
the game show host [ABC News' Anderson Cooper, who most recently was
host of 'The Mole'], so don't say, 'We are capital-J Journalists.'"</TE>
<TE>   Isaacson has repeatedly told his staff that he doesn't care if Fox
passes CNN in the ratings because the two are pursuing different
strategies. CNN executives note that despite the fact that Fox beat
CNN in January, interest in the war on terrorism increased the total
cable news channel viewer pie by more than 50%, and CNN's total-day
average viewership jumped 51% compared with the same stretch a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "I care more about the quality of our journalism, and about
keeping our eye on our own mission," Isaacson says, downplaying talk
of internal tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, CNN remains profitable, with ad sales executives saying
the U.S. channel brings in more than $250 million in revenue
annually--more than double that of either Fox News or MSNBC--with
another $100 million generated by CNN Headline News, which is almost
always packaged with CNN when selling time to advertisers. Fox is
hoping to cut into CNN's revenue, however, thanks to its ratings
gains.</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, in the eyes of many, Isaacson has focused intensely
on upgrading CNN's journalism. Morning rundown meetings used to be
dry affairs, when each bureau would list the day's planned stories so
managers could throw them into a lineup. Isaacson, to the discomfort
of some old-timers, actually stops people and challenges them, asking
what their approach is, why are they covering that story, is there a
different way to do it? His questions are about ways to tell a story,
not just get the pictures on the air, insiders say.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that the programs are in place, we can all ask questions
about what's the smart way to approach a story, where is the story
going to go, what makes it interesting," Isaacson says. "I like
sitting in those meetings more than doing the managerial duties."</TE>
<TE>   There are still trouble spots. On CNN's weekday "TalkBack Live"
during the last few weeks, it seemed as if the Sept. 11 attacks never
happened. Gone was the high-minded tone of serious news that CNN
claimed as its mission. In its place has been panel after panel of
partisan talk-radio hosts, screaming over each other.</TE>
<TE>   Although CNN says it is pursuing a serious news model, attempts in
the past year to forge a cooperative arrangement with either CBS News
or ABC News--gaining access to the prestige and promotional power of
one of those operations while sharing news-gathering resources and
thus mitigating cost pressures--have so far come to naught. CNN and
the other networks have differed on who wanted a strategic agreement
more, but ABC and CBS executives so far aren't buying CNN's attempts
to control any such joint venture, despite the financial benefits to
both sides. CNN is good at getting live pictures from far-away
places, they privately say, but its journalism lacks depth.</TE>
<TE>   So CNN, it seems, will go it alone for the moment. "Under certain
conditions we would be willing to share infrastructures" with a
broadcaster, says AOL Time Warner's chief operating officer, Bob
Pittman, but "it's not an urgent priority for us." Research has shown
that in the minds of the public, he adds, "we're the ones in the
lead. We have the credibility and trust people look for in news."</TE>
<TE>   Will all these changes be enough to provide CNN the necessary
lift? Pittman seems to think so, saying that other than doing more to
promote the channel, CNN has likely seen all the major restructuring
it will need, while calling the network "one of the year's success
stories at AOL Time Warner. They are beyond where I thought they
would be."</TE>
<TE>   Fox's Magee disagrees. "The advertising dollar turns slowly, but
it will turn," he says, "because [the ratings are] quantifiable....
I'd much rather be in the position I'm in than the position they're
in."</TE>
<TE>   Isaacson, however, expresses confidence that CNN's strategy will
work in the long run. "A strong, classy, good journalistic
environment, based on solid reporting more than opinions, produces a
quality network that viewers and advertisers will value," he says,
whether it gets the highest ratings or not.</TE>

the art world.</DH>

<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirteen years ago this week, the Museum of Modern Art in New York
opened the exhibition "Andy Warhol: A Retrospective." It was a
landmark event. Not for Warhol, but for MOMA.</LD>
<LD>   Warhol had died almost exactly two years before--a tragically
unnecessary demise, it turned out, from poorly tended complications
following routine gall bladder surgery. (He was only 59.) The show
was a very big deal for MOMA because it signaled an unmistakable
shift in attitude for the dowager empress of modern art museums.</LD>
<LD>   Pop art in general, and Warhol in particular, had always been eyed
by MOMA with, if not hostility, at least a certain frosty skepticism.
Frank Stella, Warhol's junior by eight years, had already been the
subject of not one but two retrospective surveys there--but then,
Stella was upholding the Modern's old, dull commitment to pure
abstraction as painting's highest value. By 1989, that fustian
sentiment seemed positively quaint.</LD>
<TE>   By the end of the 1980s, figurative Neo-Expressionist painting had
explosively come and gone. Photography that approached the scale and
power traditionally associated with painting was on the rise. Current
art made in Europe, where collectors had embraced American Pop with
the same fervor that Americans once brought to their embrace of
French Impressionism when it was new, had returned to center stage
after decades of postwar isolation. Los Angeles, the city that
virtually defined pop culture for America and the world, was
similarly consolidating its position as a center for the production
of new art. Warhol's work could be cited as a precedent in connection
with all these developments.</TE>
<TE>   The Modern's Warhol retrospective was both an exhibition and a
public announcement. It said the museum knew how out of touch it had
become with important currents of contemporary art and that its
future would be different.</TE>
<TE>   In December, L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art announced that it
would be hosting a Warhol retrospective. (It's scheduled to open May
25 for a three-month run.) Organized by the New National Gallery in
Berlin, where it was warmly received in the fall, and set to open
Feb. 14 in London at the Tate Modern, the show has a different
meaning for MOCA today than the earlier retrospective did for MOMA.
It signals a certain stature for the young museum.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, MOCA had tried hard to get MOMA's Warhol
retrospective--but to no avail. The show didn't travel farther west
than Chicago, where it was seen at the venerable Art Institute.
Failure to snag the important show was hugely disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol's first gallery exhibition of Pop paintings had taken place
in L.A., where in July 1962 the New York artist showed the landmark
series of 32 Campbell's soup can paintings at the old Ferus Gallery
on La Cienega Boulevard. (A rival gallery across the street answered
Warhol's refreshingly rude exhibition by displaying a stack of actual
Campbell's soup cans in its window.) "New Paintings of Common
Objects," the first American museum exhibition of Pop art, was
organized that fall by the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art (now the
Norton Simon Museum), and in 1970, Pasadena also organized Warhol's
first big museum survey, which traveled internationally. Bringing the
full Warhol retrospective from MOMA to MOCA would have closed a
circle.</TE>
<TE>   MOCA was a very young museum in 1989, though. (Its Grand Avenue
building had opened barely two years earlier.) Since then MOCA has
built quite a track record of historical exhibitions. The museum has
organized the more difficult, wide-ranging historical surveys of
critical developments in contemporary art that one might have
expected MOMA to tackle in its effort to catch up with things
current. A history of Conceptual art, the pivotal issue of
representation in a society awash in reproductions, performance
gestures that result in objects, the transition between expressive
painting by hand and the mass media world of Pop--these and other
MOCA exhibition topics have been distinctive. They made for the sort
of must-see shows of postwar art history that virtually none among
the other American museums of contemporary art even attempts. (Next
in this impressive line is an eagerly anticipated survey of
Minimalist art, set for 2003.)</TE>
<TE>   The new Warhol retrospective will arrive at MOCA on the 40th
anniversary of the Ferus and Pasadena shows. A lot has happened since
then--not just for art, but for art museums too. The announcement of
the MOCA show came at a news conference attended by journalists,
television cameras, radio microphones and the mayor, an unusual if
not unprecedented event for the museum. It's being partly sponsored
by the city, and no one at the news conference could recall a prior
instance of city funding for an art museum show. The Los Angeles
Convention and Visitors Bureau is on board and, in conjunction with
American Express and 10 participating hotels, intends to market the
exhibition aggressively to out-of-towners. (Similar involvement with
the 1999 exhibition "Van Gogh's Van Goghs" netted $7 million for the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art.) The show is MOCA's first major
foray into the economic realm of cultural tourism.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, that's something else that has come full circle. Art
historian Irving Sandler once pointed out that art museums underwent
a significant alteration in the 1960s, and that Pop was critical to
the change.</TE>
<TE>   That was the moment museum directors and curators--unlike their
predecessors--actively began to interact with the art world. The art
that came to characterize the 1960s was partly introduced in 1959 in
"Sixteen Americans," curator Dorothy C. Miller's famous MOMA show of
Neo-Dada (Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, etc.) and Post-Painterly
Abstraction (Stella, Ellsworth Kelly). By 1962--within a year of Pop
art's emergence in commercial galleries--the work was being surveyed
at the Pasadena Museum. The following spring it was featured in
museum shows in New York, Kansas City, Mo., Houston and Washington. A
year after that, a sequel to a Pop show at the Guggenheim in New York
turned up at LACMA, and other Pop exhibitions appeared in cities as
far-flung as Oakland and Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this was not the first time art museums in America had
shown very new art, but it was the first time they had done so on
such a big scale. Intimate involvement with contemporary art quickly
became the norm for museums. Increasingly, the shows they organized
reflected up-to-the-minute art world opinion. Today we take that
condition for granted, but in the history of museums it was actually
a long time coming. Pop art made the art museum pop, and things
haven't been the same since.</TE>

<LD>Every time Madonna has a new look, some music critic claims she has
"reinvented" herself.</LD>
<LD>   In the Calendar story about new retail shopping centers, Nicolai
Ouroussoff writes that "reinvention" is their only hope for survival
("No Sale in a Faux Town," Jan. 27). In that same issue, film critic
Kenneth Turan mentions Marisa Tomei's "reinventing" herself could
earn her an Oscar nomination.</LD>

<LD>How surprised and pleased I was to see the piece on the new Charley
Patton boxed set ("Debate in the Delta," by Robert Hilburn, Jan. 27).
This happened to be my Christmas present to my husband this year
(after he dropped a not-so-subtle hint by leaving the Revenant
Records' ad from Rhythm and Blues News magazine where I couldn't miss
it).</LD>
<LD>   I applaud Hilburn's profile on the man and the set, but what I
found to be missing was any indication that the package itself is a
work of art.</LD>
<LD>   The set is magnificently and artistically put together with
absolute perfection and attention to detail.</LD>
<TE>   The box is a re-creation of a box for old 78s, complete with
inside book binding and tasteful cover. Inside, everything from the
paper stock to the sepia-toned photos to the replicas of the labels
on the discs is a collector/archivist/historian's dream.</TE>
<TE>   This complete package makes the world of Charley Patton come
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Please, someone nominate this for a Grammy next year.</TE>
<TE>   MAGGIE MAYALL</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It would have been nice if the article about Delta great Charley
Patton had mentioned Dean Blackwood, the guiding light of Revenant
and the man fairly solely responsible for the great projects that the
label issues, particularly the realization of the magnificent Patton
set.</TE>
<TE>   LAWRENCE COHN</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read the "Debate in the Delta " article with great interest
until Hilburn decided to infuse the race card comments of David
Evans. In case the author didn't know, if Mr. Patton had 1/32 of
African American blood in his veins, he was considered black during
that period. Using Evans' rationale, why not label Mr. Patton's blood
lines as "Heinz 57"?</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't agree more with Hilburn's opening statement that
everything in pop music is subject to debate--and in particular his
remark about the never-ending argument over the first true rock 'n'
roll hit.</TE>
<TE>   Please add this comment to your list. The late Terry Southern,
writing in the radical '60s-'70s magazine Ramparts, described the
Rolling Stones' "(Can't Get No) Satisfaction" as "perhaps the only
true rock 'n' roll song ever recorded," a sentiment I happen to agree
with.</TE>

of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" (Letters, Jan. 13), he goes
too far with " there's not a single winking reference to modern

<LD>It certainly has been a year of lackluster, forgettable films. In
Kenneth Turan's "It's Elementary, Oscar" (Jan. 27), even the
seemingly most Oscar-worthy films will probably not have much of a
video or DVD shelf life.</LD>
<LD>   Despite its outstanding performances, "A Beautiful Mind" faltered
on its redundancy of plot points and overwrought sentimentality. "In
the Bedroom," I fear, will ultimately belong to those esteemed but
forgotten films on video store shelves such as "Gods and Monsters,"
"Secrets &amp; Lies" and "The Thin Red Line."</LD>
<LD>   "Black Hawk Down," although much honored, may be dismissed by the
public as just another violent, graphic war film. "Moulin Rouge" and
"Mulholland Drive" are acquired tastes. "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring" has the best opportunity of securing a long
shelf life, given its artistic and commercial success.</LD>
<TE>   Will sorcerers and hobbits rule on Oscar night?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, the heck with it! So what if it's nominated for best picture
and best animated feature. The Oscar goes to ... "Shrek."</TE>

<HD>Embracing Parents' Pain</HD>
<DH>From 'In the Bedroom' to 'Monster's Ball,' a spate of films
about the once-taboo topic of a child's death explores families'
complex reactions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been called the wound that never completely heals, which may
explain why society in general and Hollywood in particular have been
loath to deal with the subject.</LD>
<LD>   Now, in a sudden burst, there are four films about parents
confronting the sudden death of a child.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent arrival is last year's Palme d'Or winner at
Cannes, "The Son's Room." The film, which opened Friday, is directed
by and stars Italy's Nanni Moretti as a psychologist struggling to
cope with the accidental death of his teenage son. The widely
acclaimed "In the Bedroom" stars Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson as
parents emotionally ravaged by their son's murder. "Monster's Ball"
throws polar-opposite characters Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry
together after the deaths of their respective sons. The Australian
ensemble drama "Lantana" features Barbara Hershey as a psychologist
who becomes estranged from her husband (Geoffrey Rush) after the
murder of their daughter.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Durfee, a child psychiatrist with the Los Angeles County
Department of Health Services, applauds the current crop of films
that use the framework of a child's loss to examine the effects on
the family, with all the guilt, blame and other complex emotions that
inevitably arise. He likens the breakthrough to the decades it took
to bring the problem of child abuse into the open. Now, perhaps, this
more private battle will finally receive due attention as well, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that amazes me is that there are four movies dealing
thematically with this same subject, something that couldn't have
happened 10 years ago. It would have driven audiences away," Durfee
says. "And interestingly, it doesn't take over the whole story but
rather is used to explore characters' various levels of pain."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, there has been only a handful of movies dealing with
the after-effects of the loss of a child as the central subject of
the film. Only a few have met with mainstream acceptance, including
1980's Oscar-winning "Ordinary People," with Donald Sutherland, Mary
Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton, and the 1988 adaptation of Anne
Tyler's "The Accidental Tourist," starring William Hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Other notable examples include George Cukor's 1949 drama "Edward,
My Son," starring Deborah Kerr and Spencer Tracy; Nicolas Roeg's 1973
thriller "Don't Look Now"; the revenge dramas "An Eye for an Eye"
(1996), starring Sally Field, and "The Crossing Guard" (1995),
starring Jack Nicholson; and "The Stone Boy" (1984), with Robert
Duvall and Glenn Close. Two Meryl Streep films from the '80s deal
with the subject: "A Cry in the Dark" and "Sophie's Choice." In 1999,
Sigourney Weaver played a woman whose friend's child drowned while in
her care in "A Map of the World."</TE>
<TE>   In Atom Egoyan's 1997 "The Sweet Hereafter," Ian Holm played an
attorney who tried to persuade parents whose children had died in a
school bus accident to hire him, although that movie was more about
the lawyer and his troubled relationship with his own daughter than
about parents coping with grief.</TE>
<TE>   Audiences as well as critics are indeed responding to "In the
Bedroom," which has become a breakout art-house hit. "Monster's Ball"
and "Lantana" are also doing well in limited release (both expand to
additional screens next month).</TE>
<TE>   Like "The Son's Room," these other recent films carefully,
methodically, examine the various stages of loss and largely avoid
pat reactions or conclusions. Some characters are consumed by grief,
and turn vengeful or self-destructive. Others succumb to numbness and
self-recrimination. It's only the characters who confront their pain
and seek to share the burden with others who find any solace.</TE>
<TE>   It's precisely the head-on realism of these films that may be the
key to their acceptance. "When death is presented as a spectacle, the
audience is anesthetized," Moretti says. "That's because too often
directors hit you in the gut with style. They don't trust their
audience. I insisted on dealing with the story realistically, without
stylization. I wanted people to share the characters' feelings, to go
down that road with them together."</TE>
<TE>   Before "Monster's Ball," Swiss-born Marc Forster directed the
drama "Everything Put Together," about a mother who loses a child to
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   His fascination with the subject of parental loss, he explains,
lies "in how different people react to it since in Western society we
celebrate birth, but we treat death as unnatural."</TE>
<TE>   When he was growing up, says Todd Field, American director of "In
the Bedroom," he certainly internalized that message. "The way I was
raised, grief was a four-letter word. Talking about this subject was
considered dirty, something which people judged one another
about--they're grieving too much, they're not grieving enough. Also
in the American mentality, we always talk about getting over things.
But there are some things you can't get over.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point in your life, if you're fortunate, you walk through
a doorway [and move on], but you're still missing something," Field
says. "If you lose your right arm, you never forget you don't have a
right arm anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Even in cultures where death is more easily incorporated into the
fabric of life, this particular wound is paralyzing. "When a child
loses his parents he's called an orphan," Moretti says. "But a parent
losing a child is thought of as so unnatural, so unacceptable, so
scandalous, that there isn't even a word for it."</TE>
<TE>   The sentiments expressed in these films reflect the real-life
reactions Linda Garcia encounters as manager of child development
services at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. In educating parents
on dealing with bereavement, Garcia says she has her work cut out for
her. "It's a real dilemma to get people to talk about death or even
to use the word 'die.' It's one of the biggest challenges I've run
into in educating people about death, she says.</TE>
<TE>   When the death involves a child, the effects are particularly
devastating, often leading to a breakdown in communication among
members of a family, asserts Ray Lawrence, director of "Lantana."
Ironically, the character played by Hershey is a therapist but
doesn't reach out, remaining isolated and overwhelmed by her sorrow.
"It's truly a case of 'physician, heal thyself,'" he says. "The thing
between Valerie [Hershey's character] and John [Rush] is that they
don't share their grief. She grieves by writing a book about her
daughter, and he does it by visiting the site where she was murdered.
Grief can bring people together when they share it. But in this case,
it pushes them apart."</TE>
<TE>   The breakdown in communication is only one facet of the effects
experienced by Spacek and Wilkinson in "In the Bedroom." "What's so
horrible when you go through the loss of a child is that it
demolishes the unspoken covenant that parents will die before their
children," Field says. "We take a certain selfish comfort in that.
And when it doesn't happen, every possible weakness within yourself
will surface. All the chinks in the marriage, all the things that
have previously been traversed suddenly become insurmountable
obstacles."</TE>
<TE>   The vulnerabilities that emerge in films such as "Lantana" and "In
the Bedroom" include feelings of guilt, self-recrimination, paranoia
and even the desire for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these sensations are indicative of post-traumatic stress
disorder, which is part of the grieving process, according to Deanne
Tilton, executive director of the Los Angeles County Inter-Agency
Council on Child Abuse and Neglect, who finds this confluence of
films particularly intriguing in the wake of the nation's public
mourning after Sept. 11. "We're in the middle of witnessing profound
grief, and perhaps that's why these movies are resonating with us,"
Tilton says.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks, in which thousands of parents lost children,
gave rise to many of the same feelings. Even those who did not lose a
loved one in the tragedy, experienced a sense of disorientation,
which typifies the reactions of Moretti's characters in "The Son's
Room."</TE>
<TE>   The husband, wife and their surviving daughter drift apart,
dealing with their grief differently and separately. "I wanted to
dispel the myth that pain and suffering always unites people," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Hershey character in "Lantana," Moretti's protagonist is
also a therapist. But, as Tilton points out, "being a therapist isn't
any insurance at all that you can deal with your own grief,
especially since people who deal with others' grief are used to
giving help but have a hard time asking for it."</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to show what happens to someone who, on a daily basis,
sees others' pain when he's confronted with the worst pain one can
have," Moretti says.</TE>
<TE>   While working on the script, Moretti confesses, he didn't know
what the film's outcome would be. Unlike Hershey's character, who
tries to forge on, Moretti's character does talk to a colleague and
eventually makes a difficult decision in order to confront his grief.
"It's not a defeat, nor is it a victory," he explains. "It's simply a
choice of awareness."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, dealing with his feelings and sharing them with his
wife and daughter prove beneficial, although the film's ending is
ambiguous. So too is the resolution in "Monster's Ball." When Forster
takes leave of his characters, their fate is open-ended. There can be
no closure, he insists, because they are still in the early stages of
the mourning process. "There is a numbness that sets in after the
loss of a child, and it takes many months, even years, to realize
what it meant to you or how you feel about it," he says. "Only after
a certain time goes by can you really grieve."</TE>
<TE>   Yet he offers a glimmer of hope in the burgeoning romance between
two disparate people "who under normal circumstances would never end
up together, but [through tragedy] find a way to relate to one
another," Forster says.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia says she hopes these movies "give people permission to talk
about and to deal with their own unresolved feelings of loss. The
analogy I make is that we have a choice to walk through a shattered
window pane, and feel the pain and anguish, or we walk around it,
deny it. But sometime in your lifetime you'll have to deal with that
unresolved grief, or it will come back and haunt you."</TE>
<TE>   Field says his film has triggered precisely the kinds of responses
Garcia addressed.</TE>
<TE>   "At every screening I've attended since last January [when 'In the
Bedroom' debuted at Sundance], at least one person has come up to me
and taken me aside to tell me an intensely personal story. And it
usually starts with 'I don't know why I'm telling you, but I can't
talk to anyone else about this.'"</TE>

<HD>'Best of Both Worlds' Is One Album Title That May Not Be
Hyperbole</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Singer R. Kelly's last album, "TP-2.com," has sold 3.4 million copies
in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Jay-Z's last album, "Blueprint," has sold 1.9 million. So an album
by the two together should sell 5.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   That's not how it works, of course. But "Best of Both Worlds," an
album pairing the R&amp;B and rap stars and due March 26 from Island Def
Jam  Records, is easily the consensus pick for the biggest new
release expected between now and the beginning of summer in a survey
of music insiders.</LD>
<TE>   Is that a sure thing? More than ever, the radio programmers and
retail executives periodically polled by Pop Eye to predict the top
sellers of coming months are shying away from absolute statements.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge right now is that there's a very fickle marketplace
where a lot of the big records that had a lot of hype around them for
the holiday season didn't pan out," says Bob Bell, new music buyer
for the Wherehouse chain. "So there aren't any sure things now."</TE>
<TE>   The only other albums that panelists deemed safe bets are Celine
Dion's return from maternity leave, "A New Day Has Come," tentatively
due March 26, and Eminem's follow-up to the 8.6-million-selling "The
Marshall Mathers LP," expected for April release.</TE>
<TE>   This season is looking pretty fallow for new superstar product.
That can be blamed partly on Sept. 11, which delayed a lot of
production schedules so that more of 2002's big albums will be
released in summer and fall than in most years.</TE>
<TE>   That opens the field for some new developments. On one front, a
sizable brigade of established female artists is returning to the
marketplace. In addition to Dion's collection, new albums are coming
from Sheryl Crow, Brandy, Bonnie Raitt, Alanis Morissette and Cher,
all of whom have had some dramatic ups and downs with past records.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a lot of effort at record companies to position new
and emerging women artists as singer-songwriters--in pop to separate
the acts from the flagging teen world, and in R&amp;B to suggest they
could be the next Alicia Keys or India.Arie.</TE>
<TE>   Labels are also taking advantage of the dearth of new superstar
collections to release reworked versions of old items. Remix albums
are coming from Jennifer Lopez (the third version of her "J-Lo"
album), Destiny's Child and Linkin Park, while a new edition of Mary
J. Blige's "Mary," with added songs, is on the way. No one expects
these to rival the sales of the original versions, but a radio hit or
two could drive any one of them to impressive levels.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a breakdown of the spring horse races, with only as many
picks per genre as justified, and comments from panelists where
appropriate. Release dates are subject to change.</TE>
<TE>   Pop</TE>
<TE>   Win--Jay-Z and R. Kelly. "This will be huge," says Michael Steele,
music director of Los Angeles pop powerhouse KIIS-FM (102.7). "The R.
Kelly song from 'Ali' has turned out bigger than the movie, so
there's a lot of momentum here."</TE>
<TE>   Place--Celine Dion. "I've heard the single and a couple of mixes,"
Steele says. "I was impressed."</TE>
<TE>   Show--Cher, "Living Proof" (Feb. 26). "I love the single," Steele
says of the follow-up to Cher's "Believe" comeback. "Nothing
groundbreaking, but Cher fans will love it, and the two songs I've
heard are better than anything on the last album."</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse--Kylie Minogue, "Fever" (Feb. 26). Capitol Records is
going hard on the breakthrough from the Australian former teen star.
"It's got four potential hit singles," Steele says. "It's a lot more
than just candy pop."</TE>
<TE>   Rock</TE>
<TE>   Win--The debut album from the still unnamed group teaming former
Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell with Rage Against the Machine's Tom
Morello, Tim C. and Brad Wilk (release date to be announced). Korn's
next album would have been the runaway winner, but its release has
apparently been pushed back to summer. This choice is a tenuous one
as well: Will it make it by Memorial Day and what will it be when it
arrives?</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't heard any music yet," KROQ-FM (106.7) music director
Lisa Worden says. "I think listeners are curious. None of us knows
what to expect."</TE>
<TE>   Place--Weezer, "Maladroit," date TBA.</TE>
<TE>   Show--Coldplay, title TBA (late spring). "Coldplay stands out from
the hard stuff we play, and every song we've played from the first
album has worked for us," Worden says.</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse--New Found Glory, "Sticks and Stones" (June 4).</TE>
<TE>   Hip-Hop</TE>
<TE>   Win--Jay-Z and R. Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   Place--Eminem.</TE>
<TE>   Show--Xzibit, "Man vs. Machine" (April 2). "This might be the one
to take him to the top," E-Man, music director of KPWR-FM (105.9),
says of the veteran rapper.</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse--Royce Da 5'9", title to be announced. (Feb. 26). The
release from Eminem's latest Detroit protege has production by the
controversial rapper, who also appears on the first single, "Rock
City."</TE>
<TE>   R&amp;B</TE>
<TE>   Win--Jay-Z and R. Kelly. "This is actually my only bet this poor
sales period," Wherehouse urban music buyer Violet Brown says.</TE>
<TE>   Place--Brandy, "Full Moon" (March 5). "The single's incredible,
and from the rest of the album, it's not a fluke," says Dorsey
Fuller, music director at KKBT-FM (100.3).</TE>
<TE>   Show--Raphael Saadiq, "Instant Vintage" (May 28). "Several songs
have a chance to be big," Fuller says of the solo debut by the former
Tony Toni Tone singer. "The first is a collaboration with D'Angelo,
and there's one with T-Boz from TLC."</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse--Tweet, "Southern Hummingbird" (April 2). Working with
Missy Elliott and Timbaland, a strong entry in the new soul
sweepstakes.</TE>
<TE>   Adult</TE>
<TE>   Win--Celine Dion.</TE>
<TE>   Place--Sheryl Crow, title TBA. (April 9). "She seems to be an
artist's artist, no real negative baggage as far as the public's
concerned," Steele says.</TE>
<TE>   Show--Alanis Morissette, "Under Rug Swept" (Feb. 26). "Now that
she's the underdog, I'm really rooting for her," Wherehouse's Bell
says.</TE>
<TE>   Country</TE>
<TE>   Win--No pick. "There's no word on when the Dixie Chicks album will
be and that would be the most anticipated," says KZLA-FM (93.9) music
director Tonya Campos. "And there's talk that Shania Twain might come
out with something, but not until later in the year."</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse--Shannon Lawson, "Chase the Sun," (early June). "No one
knows who he is, but he can sing," Campos says of the Kentucky
native. "If the rest of his stuff is as good as the single, 'Goodbye
on a Bad Day,' which we're already playing, the album will be
phenomenal."</TE>

Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi, who has received

<LD>   MATTHEW SHIPP</LD>
<LD>   "Nu Bop"</LD>
<TE>   Thirsty Ear</TE>
<TE>   With each recording, iconoclastic pianist Shipp ventures more
deeply into uncharted musical terrain, and he does so to particularly
striking effect on his latest release. There may be no jazz pianist
in the country who incorporates cutting-edge technology, modern dance
beats, record "scratching" and other sounds of the times into the
lexicon of jazz improvisation as persuasively as Shipp. Virtually
every track on this stunning CD bristles with new ideas and
unexpected juxtapositions. From the ebullient dance beats on "Space
Shipp" to the space-age sound effects on the title track, from the
gloriously thick chord-clusters of "ZX-1" to the exotic Asian scales
of "D's Choice," Shipp embraces an astonishing range of musical
influences--and makes them cohere. Joined by longtime collaborator
William Parker on bass, Shipp presides over a quintet that merges
acoustic and electronic idioms to often startling effect.</TE>

<TE>   FRANK CATALANO</TE>
<TE>   "Live at the Green Mill"</TE>
<TE>   Delmark</TE>
<TE>   The latest "tough tenor" to come out of Chicago, saxophonist
Catalano plays with all the fire and fury that have come to define
Windy City style. Indeed, it's not difficult to detect in Catalano's
playing the influence of such fabled Chicago tenor-wielders as Von
Freeman, Johnny Griffin and Fred Anderson. You can hear it in the
ferocious energy and gritty tone Catalano brings to John Coltrane's
"Impressions" and in the declamatory phrasing and keening tone with
which he reinvigorates "Softly as in a Morning Sunrise." Although
he's not yet 25, Catalano plays with the self-assurance and harmonic
mastery of an older musician, yet without sacrificing the
extraordinary passion of youth. This well-made live recording
represents the most accurate sonic portrait yet of Catalano's work.
And although one applauds the nimble playing of trumpeter Randy
Brecker, whose appearance on this disc represents a significant vote
of confidence from an established master, Catalano ultimately needs
no such star support. His playing easily is accomplished enough to
stand on its own.</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   ANTHONY WILSON TRIO</TE>
<TE>   "Our Gang"</TE>
<TE>   Groove Note</TE>
<TE>   Guitarist Wilson has made a name for himself as a rising
composer-arranger, so perhaps it should come as no surprise that his
uncommonly sensitive ear for instrumental balances distinguishes this
recording. "Our Gang" avoids the cliches of the typical organ-guitar
trio jazz disc, bypassing the usual heavy backbeats, throbbing chords
and dance-oriented grooves. Instead, Wilson offers a refreshingly
light, ethereal ensemble sound, with an emphasis on purling melody,
delicate chordal fills and light percussion work. From the
recording's first track, Wilson and friends disarm the listener with
the sheer subtlety of their use of color and voicing on the title
tune. The very name of "Chitlins Con Carne" might portend a hot and
hard-hitting cut, but even here the trio produces a genteel approach
to jazz-soul traditions. Throughout, Wilson plays lines that are as
economical as they are elegantly sculpted.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   CYRUS CHESTNUT</TE>
<TE>   "Soul Food"</TE>
<TE>   Atlantic</TE>
<TE>   Chestnut may be the most amiable young pianist in jazz. In concert
and on disc, he seems intent on bringing high spirits and palpable
optimism to everything he plays. "Soul Food" underscores the point,
with its penchant for upbeat tempos, church-influenced beats and
bright, major keys. Some listeners might consider this music
lightweight, and, indeed, it does not attempt to make deep or
profound statements. Yet Chestnut's pianism is so deftly articulated
and his fine collaborators so willing to share in his sunny vision
that the music can be difficult to resist. How could anyone be
unswayed by the band's gospel-tinged version of Chestnut's "Brother
Hawky Hawk" or by his gently rolling solo piano version of "Coming
Through the Rye"? Although important artists such as bassist
Christian McBride, drummer Lewis Nash, vibist Stefon Harris,
trumpeter Marcus Printup and saxophonist James Carter typically play
more aggressive fare, on this occasion they warmly support Chestnut
in a pleasant if unprovocative disc.</TE>

<HD>This'll Just Take a Minute</HD>
<DH>The 60-second works pianist Guy Livingston commissions are
more than novelties. They give new music wider exposure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On paper, "Don't Panic! 60 Seconds for Piano" sounds suspiciously
like a shameless plea for attention in a jaded age. Pianist Guy
Livingston, an American living in Paris since 1992, spent nearly
three years commissioning piano pieces lasting a minute or less,
paying scores of composers with a bottle of Jack Daniels for their
efforts.</LD>
<LD>   But as it turns out, the project is much more than a novelty. On a
CD released last year on the German Wergo label, it sounds true to
the pianist's stated intentions: present new piano music, in heaping,
if piecemeal portions; expose music by young and little-known
composers.</LD>
<LD>   It's also a calling card for the pianist. Livingston will perform
60 of the pieces (he has 150 and counting) Monday at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art's Bing Theater.</LD>
<TE>   The performance set will include works by a diverse, international
list of composers, including such New York new music downtowners as
Annie Gosfield and Elliott Sharp, and such established composers as
William Bolcom and Louis Andriessen (who wrote his soft, dreamy line
quickly, on the backs of envelopes).</TE>
<TE>   By and large, though, the music is by composers little known in
the general musical world.</TE>
<TE>   "You become painfully aware of how many composers are out there,
eager for something to do," Livingston says by phone from
Philadelphia, where he was visiting family. "For some of the people,
the disc represents their first recorded work. It's had a lot of
impact on their career, especially if they're just starting out."</TE>
<TE>   Although Livingston considers at least the first chapter of his
project finished, the music just keeps on coming.</TE>
<TE>   "Even now, I get stuff in the mail. It's great. It's like getting
musical postcards from around the world."</TE>
<TE>   When the seeds of the project first sprouted, in 1995,
Livingston--then in his 20s--was a student at the Royal Conservatory
of the Netherlands, after graduating from Yale and the New England
Conservatory of Music. He had spent an arduous year learning Charles
Ives' epic "Concord Sonata," and, he recalled, "I needed a diversion.</TE>
<TE>   "A friend of mine had just written a 30-second opera. I was
thinking, 'What if you could do something like that for the piano? Do
some really short things?'</TE>
<TE>   "Once I asked composers to write, I realized I was onto something.
People got very excited. Some of them actually wrote me several
pieces, and then they would tell their friends, who would call me and
say, 'Hey, can I write a piece?'</TE>
<TE>   "Once I got the idea of doing it as a full evening, I had to
buckle down and work to get good pieces, and 60 of them."</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the matter of paying the piper: Being an
impecunious student, Livingston came up with the notion of Jack
Daniels, a tip of the hat to his roots as a Tennessee native.</TE>
<TE>   He finalized the set of 60 in 1998, recorded it in 1999, and now
Livingston, 34, has performed the basic group in concerts in South
America, Europe and New York, where the New York Times called it
"quirky enough to appeal to listeners who have doubts about modern
musical language." A critic for the German newspaper Suddeutsche
Zeitung wrote that it was " hard to decide whether to marvel more
over Livingston's breathtaking ability, his high musical intelligence
or his theatrical humor."</TE>
<TE>   Consider William Bolcom's contribution: "A 60-second Ballet (for
Chickens),"  in which brevity meets melodic poise and the composer's
signature wit. "The piece is a complete parody of 'Swan Lake,'"
Livingston says, "but it's so sweetly done, you can't help but like
it."</TE>
<TE>   The project attracted humor like bees to honey.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't necessarily expect [that]," Livingston says, but he
grants that in general the new music world is full of the serious and
the thorny.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people felt freed up. Ironically, the constraint actually
gave them more freedom. They only had a minute, which is outrageously
short. Only a few composers have ever done that. You've got Webern, a
couple of Chopin preludes. Even [Chopin's] 'Minute Waltz' is not a
minute long. A lot of people went kind of nuts and wrote something
kind of funny or silly."</TE>
<TE>   The humor extends to the actual identity of the composers. One is
a member of the animal kingdom, non-human division--"Piece for Paws,"
by Ketzel Cotel. Ketzel is, in fact, the cat of Morris Cotel,
chairman of the composition department at Baltimore's Peabody
Conservatory, who claims to have dutifully transcribed 21 seconds'
worth of his feline's prancing on the keys. (The result, to this
listener's ears, is a tidbit of tender abstraction.)</TE>
<TE>   Mention this track to Livingston, and he suddenly seems a bit
sheepish about the publicity gimmick factor involved.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sick to death of that piece," he says, laughing. "I was going
to write my own article about the behind-the-scenes aspects of this
project, and call it 'That Damn Cat.' I have to thank the cat and the
cat's owner, because they did provide us with a lot of publicity at
the very beginning, when I was really looking for composers."</TE>
<TE>   Even when the pieces aren't funny, they tend to push the stylistic
and technical boundaries of contemporary piano music. Some involve
prepared piano and electronics. Some simply create a dizzying,
sprinting workout. The flying-fingered exercise of Dan Warburton's
"Speed Study," which touches on all 88 keys in its short duration,
resembles the fiendish player-piano studies of Conlon Nancarrow.</TE>
<TE>   "To some extent," Livingston explains, "the composers knew me very
well and they wrote pieces that they thought would be appropriately
virtuosic or theatrical, particularly tailored to the kind of music I
often play. So the disc reflects not only their tastes, but also
their perception of what I'd be able to do well."</TE>
<TE>   Livingston is trying hard not to have a career based only on his
60-second inspiration. "Of course, I continue to play Boulez and Ives
and other composers who have a lot of heavy and serious things to
say, about much more lofty concepts than chickens, like war and
peace."</TE>
<TE>   After the LACMA gig, Livingston will head up to Stanford
University to research an ambitious recording project, three CDs
documenting the piano music of American composer George Antheil
(famed for his "Ballet Mecanique" and his leadership role in the
avant-garde of the '20s in Paris).</TE>
<TE>   Antheil has become something of an obsession for Livingston, who
has written about him and is secretary of a sort of French Antheil
fan club.</TE>
<TE>   What about the composer intrigues Livingston?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, he was a nut. There are parallels between his life and some
of the things I've done. We both grew up in small-town America and
then moved, pretty young, to Paris. He then had a brilliant career
and became immediately famous by the time he was 23. I'm still
working on that part.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a totally wild career and then ended up in Hollywood,
writing movie music. I hate to say, it was kind of second-rate. But
he was a pianist by training, and that's really where he shone. What
I'm looking at mostly is the music he wrote in his Futurist period,
from 1922 to 1929 or so. I'm working from gigantic pieces of paper
that are totally indecipherable, but man, it's great."</TE>
<TE>   And he's not through yet with "Don't Panic."</TE>
<TE>   "Occasionally, I'll meet a composer and say, 'Hey, I wish you'd
write me a one-minute piece.' And there are those bits and pieces
that just show up as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll keep collecting them. In 10 years or so, I'll come out with
a new 'Don't Panic!' We'll see what the difference is, how music has
changed."</TE>

<HD>Cautious Airline Sector Preparing for Takeoff</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Economic recovery will be the key to carriers'
efforts to put the crisis of last year behind them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Travelers enduring long lines and random security checks at airports
are an apt metaphor for the airline industry itself: As the carriers
move forward from the tumult of Sept. 11, they're doing so with slow,
hesitant steps--and not without a good deal of scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   The industry last week closed the book on the worst year in
aviation's history, with Delta Air Lines Inc. and UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines joining most of their peers in reporting staggering
fourth-quarter losses. Altogether, the airlines lost more than $7
billion in 2001--a sum that would have been higher if not for the
federal bailout package--and they're still losing millions of dollars
a day.</LD>
<LD>   But now a few carriers such as United, Delta and AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines cautiously are restoring service in selected
regions of the country and recalling several hundred employees. Those
carriers, along with most others, had taken the unprecedented step of
slashing their operations by 15% to 20% after the terrorist attacks,
throwing nearly 100,000 people out of work.</LD>
<TE>   "Our industry is now in the transition period between crisis
aftermath and the next stage--initial recovery," Delta Chairman and
Chief Executive Leo F. Mullin told analysts last week.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, 2002 stands as a critical test of whether the airlines can
put last year's crisis behind them and build on that recovery. It's
an immensely difficult task. To stop losing money and restore service
on a widespread scale, the industry must persuade many more people to
fly again and at higher fares. The airlines' other main options are
to keep cutting costs, including labor, or, if their losses persist,
seek merger partners.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the airlines keep rebounding, there's another hurdle to
clear: Efficiently moving those larger numbers of travelers through
heightened airport-security checks. Otherwise, the airlines risk
consumer backlash against long delays and late arrivals.</TE>
<TE>   And a key factor in whether the industry can get back to its
pre-Sept. 11 size is the U.S. economy, which is out of the airlines'
control. But if the economy strengthens this year, as many forecast,
it should give the carriers the financial tailwind to continue
restoring service and rehiring workers.</TE>
<TE>   That's the scenario embraced by the stock market, where airline
shares have risen sharply since early November. "The major initial
shock to the system following Sept. 11 has by and large run its
course," said Reno Bianchi, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, experts are debating whether the carriers will commit an
old sin and restore service too soon--ahead of the economy's
comeback--in an effort to grab market share from each other.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the debate over the airlines' most important
customer: the business traveler.</TE>
<TE>   Most agree that business travel will pick up in tandem with
leisure travel as the economy expands. But critics contend that
unless the airlines simplify and reduce business fares, a sizable
chunk of that market may not return for a long time, blocking a full
recovery for carriers and their employees.</TE>
<TE>   It's an intricate puzzle to solve. Adding service and recalling
workers means the airlines first need more passengers paying higher
fares. But until the economy gets better, the carriers need fare
sales to generate travel--which cuts into their profits. And without
enough profits, airline executives are hard-pressed to justify
putting more planes in the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a closer look at some pieces of that puzzle--the airlines'
key segments and constituents--and how they might come together this
year:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Airlines</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, when the airlines dramatically shrank their
operations and begged for a $15-billion federal bailout to survive,
many predicted the industry would never be the same.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly four months later, they were partly right. The added
security--including more random searches, 100% baggage matching and
reinforced cockpit doors--is without parallel. Some of the weaker
airlines, such as US Airways, may never return to their former size.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many parts of the airline business haven't changed much. The
carriers still use fare cuts to quickly drum up sales. Organized
labor and management continue to feud. Low-cost maverick Southwest
Airlines  did not cut back after Sept. 11 and another smaller
carrier, Alaska Airlines, expects this month to return to its
pre-attack operations.</TE>
<TE>   Several others are taking a go-slow approach to bringing back
service. American last week said it would restore 41 round-trip
flights from its Dallas-Fort Worth base to 37 cities by March 2,
start service between Oakland and New York and add flights to Boston.
United said it plans to add 127 flights in April.</TE>
<TE>   American, the nation's largest airline, recalled 400 flight
attendants, 800 reservations agents and hundreds of airport and ramp
personnel. The steps are in response to "indications that air travel
is increasing," the airline said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a measured increase, however. United and Delta are resuming
some of their service with 50-seat regional jets because there isn't
enough passenger traffic to bring back the larger, conventional
jetliners on those routes.</TE>
<TE>   The big question is how much more will the airlines expand this
year or, to use the industry's jargon, add capacity. Although the
airlines would like to add capacity to earn bigger profits from the
economy's rebound, they don't want to guess wrong and find themselves
with too many empty seats if the economy continues to flounder.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is: Where is the economy headed, and how well and
how disciplined will the airlines manage their capacity?" analyst
Bianchi said. "Will they make the mistake of putting more capacity
ahead of an economic recovery?"</TE>
<TE>   The industry's consensus is that the economy will grow stronger
during 2002 but that the airlines will restrain their growth to
ensure profits. Delta for one "will remain disciplined in our
capacity decisions throughout 2002," its chief financial officer,
Michele Burns, told analysts last week.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that, regardless of predictions that the economy
will rebound, the airlines can't count on a rebound in business
travel until it happens. Business fliers typically don't book in
advance, paying more for seats than vacation travelers who plan their
trips, and thus account for most of an airline's income. Business
travel was down well before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines will be watching closely to see how much traffic they
get during spring break and the summer travel season, but it's the
business traveler who will be key in restoring earnings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Passengers</TE>
<TE>   One such traveler is Rod Carter, a managing director in the Los
Angeles office of investment firm RBC Dain Rauscher. A frequent flier
who logged more than 100,000 miles last year, Carter said he flies as
much as before on business, but that many others aren't because of
the weak economy.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more I see a lot of bankers and lawyers I deal with
asking their clients 'Can this be done over the telephone?''' he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Mitchell, who heads the Business Travel Coalition, an
advocacy group, said "the airlines were absolutely blindsided by the
falloff in business travel" last year. He said the carriers still
underestimate how many companies are locking in travel restrictions,
regardless of what the economy does, because the companies are fed up
with high business fares.</TE>
<TE>   "What the airlines don't get is that many [chief financial
officers] are asking: Do we really need to see the customer four
times a year, or is twice plus the annual industry convention
sufficient?" Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that business fares are "too complex, irrational,
inconsistent," and that if the airlines want to see business travel
return to past levels, they must simplify and restructure the fares
to narrow the gap between business and leisure ticket prices.</TE>
<TE>   United, for one, concedes there's a problem. Not only is business
travel down, but "business travelers are finding access to real low
fares" to keep a lid on their own companies' costs, United President
Rono Dutta told analysts Friday. "That's hurting us."</TE>
<TE>   As for leisure fares, they've been on sale for most of the last
four months, but whether they stay low seems to depend on the flight
and what the economy does in the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   If the economy heats up and the airlines don't add capacity, their
planes will be crowded--enabling the carriers to raise fares. For
now, there are plenty of bargains on many domestic and international
flights because of seasonally low passenger loads. Fares to Europe,
in particular, are down sharply.</TE>
<TE>   But Tom Parsons, chief executive of Bestfares.com, said prices to
warm-weather destinations such as Hawaii and Mexico are rising fast.</TE>
<TE>   "The price increases may mean that the airlines are making their
first moves to boost yields after posting billions of dollars of red
ink the fourth quarter," Parsons said, referring to the industry's
term for average ticket prices.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the typical surge in passenger traffic this spring and
summer will put the new security measures to a major test. Most
travelers are enduring the security checks because the long lines and
delays, while inconvenient, are tolerable.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, the drop in passenger traffic since Sept. 11 means planes
are leaving and arriving on time more often.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a hassle," said business traveler Carter. "It's
more stressful. But you just deal with it, and it's part of the new
world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Employees</TE>
<TE>   The dismissal of thousands of airline workers took only days, but
it will be months or years before they all return. "The carriers are
going to slowly feed capacity back into the system where it's
profitable, and very slowly feed back in people" to their payrolls,
said Ash of Global Aviation.</TE>
<TE>   There are bright spots. Southwest, Alaska and some small carriers
such as JetBlue Airways had virtually no layoffs after Sept. 11, and
those carriers hope to grow slightly in 2002, perhaps generating new
jobs. The recall of hundreds of workers at American bodes well for
some additional workers to regain employment as other major airlines
gradually add back service.</TE>
<TE>   But that's little solace for most of the laid-off workers, said
Frank Larkin, a spokesman for the International Assn. of Machinists.
"While there are fractional increases in flight schedules, there is
no indication that large percentages of the 100,000-plus employees
are being recalled," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that although the airlines are adding some flights,
they've also been cutting elsewhere--United recently closed four
reservations centers in California and furloughed hundreds of
workers. "From our perspective, it's kind of premature to speculate
about recovery while some airlines are still cutting jobs," Larkin
said.</TE>
<TE>   The machinists and other unions continue to seek better contracts,
and that's continuing the long-standing friction between many airline
unions and management. The tug-of-war is most evident at United,
whose 15,000 mechanics are threatening to strike this month if the
two sides can't reach agreement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Investors</TE>
<TE>   Although the fear of flying that set in after Sept. 11 remains,
the fear of owning airline stocks quickly dissipated, especially
after President Bush signed the federal bailout bill. The American
Stock Exchange's index of airline shares has jumped 31% since Sept.
11, far outpacing the broader market as measured by the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index.</TE>
<TE>   Investors concluded that airline stocks, which plunged in the
weeks after the attacks, had nowhere to go but up with the help of
the bailout and the predicted economic recovery this year. The
bailout included $5 billion in immediate cash aid and $10 billion in
loan guarantees. But most airlines haven't bothered with the
guarantees, saying they have enough cash to sustain them until the
market improves.</TE>
<TE>   Several airlines, including the two biggest--American and United,
each have more than $2 billion in cash on hand and the ability to
borrow more, using their jetliners as collateral. They have until
June 28 to decide whether they want the federal loan guarantees just
in case.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the terrorist attacks, the only profitable airlines
were Southwest, Alaska and Continental, because the slowing economy
and drop in business travel had pushed the other major carriers into
the red. Now, as the industry recovers, analysts expect those to be
the first to regain profitability in 2002, with the rest of the
industry following in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But that's barring any more shocks to the air-travel system, and
assuming the economy improves as forecast. If events go the other way
and the airlines' losses start mounting again, some carriers could be
forced to find merger partners to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Delta's Mullin, a proponent of consolidation, said any merger
scenario "will be very dependent on economic trends" as the year
unfolds. But he added, "The jury is still very much out on that."</TE>

<HD>Good Reasons Behind Government Deficit</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday will attempt to deliver a big boost to the
economy, as well as return the United States to years of deficits,
when he presents to Congress a proposed budget of more than $2.1
trillion in expenditures for fiscal 2003, which begins Oct. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The White House projects another deficit to follow in fiscal 2004,
and further deficits are likely until later in the decade. The
federal budget will run a $106-billion deficit in the current year,
fiscal 2002.</LD>
<LD>   But that's not a bad thing, economists say. The government is
pumping money into the economy, expanding industry at a time when the
business community is not investing with the vigor it showed in the
1990s. And American consumers, taken in the aggregate, are too
burdened by debt to lift and propel the giant U.S. economy.</LD>
<TE>   So government will provide the engine, and because the economy is
lagging today, higher government spending is not likely to boost
interest rates in the next year or two.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there are reasons to spend, says economist William
Rhodes of Rhodes Analytics, a Boston-based research firm for
institutional investors. "We've suffered a serious, nefarious attack
by a crew of maniacs who want to kill us en masse, so it behooves us
to defend ourselves and that requires a lot of borrowing and
spending," Rhodes says.</TE>
<TE>   Defense spending would expand under the proposal to $379 billion,
from about $331 billion in the current year, as the Pentagon embarks
on a decade-long program of buying aircraft and ships and all sorts
of missile-guiding electronic gear, not to mention raising the pay of
about 1.5 million members of the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force's F-22, made by Lockheed Martin Corp., and Joint
Strike Fighter, by Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp., and the
Navy's F/A-18 fighter, made by Boeing Co., will be ordered in great
numbers over the decade.</TE>
<TE>   A long-range military strategy, in which the U.S. cannot count on
having overseas bases, requires cargo and troop carriers. So there
will be years of orders for C-130 planes by Lockheed and C-17 planes
by Boeing. Ships will be needed, from shipbuilding subsidiaries of
General Dynamics Corp. and Northrop Grumman.</TE>
<TE>   And a new tanker plane will be needed to replace the
half-century-old KC-135, which was a model for the Boeing 707
commercial jet. "The Air Force wants the Boeing 767 to replace it,"
says Loren Thompson, director of Lexington Institute, a research
company in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Federal outlays for homeland security, a new budget category born
of the terrors of Sept. 11, would rise to $38 billion under Bush's
proposal. And that level of government commitment is spurring the
development of a whole new industry in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The traditional security industry consists of 12,000 small guard
service firms and a few large skilled companies, including Wackenhut
Corp. of Palm Beach, Fla.; Securitas of Sweden, which in recent years
has acquired the Pinkerton and Burns agencies in the U.S.; and
Inter-Con Security Systems, a privately owned company in Pasadena
that protects U.S. embassies and many government buildings in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry is being transformed by the events of Sept. 11,
says Neil Martou, vice president of business development for
Inter-Con. All companies and institutions, particularly electric
utilities, water treatment firms and shippers of chemicals and other
materials, recognize a need for more sophisticated security services.</TE>
<TE>   The security industry will be adding jobs in the next few
years--guards, inspectors, consultants on security matters. "Security
is moving from a routine company function to a concern of the chief
executive," Martou says. His company has received hundreds of
requests for guidance since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Spurred by government spending, "new private capital will invest
in this industry," Martou says. New systems for identification and
property tracking will emerge. Traditional alarm companies, such as
the Sensormatic and ADT subsidiaries of Tyco International Ltd., will
have to scurry to keep up with changing technology. Science
Applications International Corp., a large employee-owned firm in San
Diego, is just completing development of a new product that uses
ultrasound techniques for identification.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Budget Thinking Not This Expansive Since '80s</TE>
<TE>   The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries will receive funds
to work on defenses against bioterrorism. The response to terrorism's
challenge will be broad. "Homeland security will make America not
only stronger but in many ways better," Bush said in the State of the
Union message. "Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will
improve public health."</TE>
<TE>   Bush pledged to expand spending on education and health and aid to
unemployed workers. Budget thinking has not been so expansive since
the 1980s, when President Reagan raised defense spending dramatically
and launched a period of big deficits in the federal budget.</TE>
<TE>   The 1980s had some parallels to today. The U.S. had a large trade
deficit then and has one today. The twin deficits--budget and
trade--were a source of concern then because other countries were
growing and developing--Japan in particular--and the U.S. was
concerned with its own competitiveness.</TE>
<TE>   But the comparisons end there. Today the world economy practically
revolves around the U.S. Japan remains in economic doldrums that have
lasted 10 years. Europe, including once-dynamic Germany, has its own
problems of spurring economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   So the U.S. economy remains the dominant economic engine.
Washington's new deficit spending will help spur the world economy
too, mainly by increasing U.S. ability to import goods and services
from other economies.</TE>
<TE>   This probably will widen the trade deficit. However, those other
economies, from Asia to Europe to Latin America, will continue to
invest in U.S. government and corporate securities, as they currently
do at the rate of more than $1 billion a day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Deficit Spending Risky but Necessary</TE>
<TE>   Deficits in the federal budget and in the trade account are likely
to persist for some years. Is there a risk to that? Sure, continued
government deficits lead to higher interest rates and a crowding out
of private business as the economy recovers. Down the road, the U.S.
economy may have to go through a budget-tightening process similar to
that of the early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   But in the present circumstances, from the standpoint both of
national defense and the economy, deficit spending is not a bad
thing.</TE>
<TE>   And it's a good idea also to recall other developments of the
1980s that may see parallels to this decade. Partly because of the
great increase in defense related research in the '80s, that decade
saw the development of microprocessor technology and unprecedented
advances in communications technology. When the '80s ended with the
fall of the Berlin Wall, the flowering of technology that was the
1990s dawned.</TE>
<TE>   A decade is too far to look ahead today. But in the next year or
two, big federal budgets will spur new surprises for the U.S.--and
world--economy.</TE>

<HD>Health-Care Field Sees Growth Spurt in Jobs</HD>
<DH>Employment: As many industries falter, the sector continues
to hire. Among newcomers are dot-com refugees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The technology sector is in tatters, and assembly line work is
dwindling. But in hospitals, doctors' offices and other medical
facilities across America, a new job is born every two minutes.</LD>
<LD>   If any industry can claim to have whipped the recession, it's
health care. Over the last 12 months, as the overall U.S. economy
shed 1.2 million jobs, health services added 297,000 positions.</LD>
<LD>   The sector has not only held its ground during the downturn, the
rate of job creation has gradually accelerated. The hiring binge has
softened the recession's blow, providing work for people who
otherwise might do without. Fueled by powerful demographic and
technological forces, health-care employment has become one of the
few engines of growth in the U.S. economy.</LD>
<TE>   For Rebeca Sanchez, it may be the ticket to a new life. A
30-year-old single mother in San Diego, Sanchez was laid off in
October by a struggling Latino telecommunications firm. On Jan. 25,
she graduated from a program that trains foreign-born workers with
limited English skills to become certified nursing assistants.
There's a CNA position waiting for her at the Magnolia Special Care
Center, a nursing home in El Cajon, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good for me, and for my family," said Sanchez, who hopes
health care will provide the financial stability and career
opportunities she has sought. "I want to go farther. I think I need
only a little more time."</TE>
<TE>   But there are limits to the industry's ability to provide the jobs
the rest of the economy can't. Despite all the recent hires,
hospitals and other health-care employers face acute shortages of
nurses, pharmacists, technicians and other highly trained medical
personnel. The fierce competition for job candidates is driving up
costs and limiting the industry's ability to keep up with increasing
demand for its services.</TE>
<TE>   "We are facing work force shortages that are expected to
dramatically worsen in the next five to 10 years," American Hospital
Assn. Vice President Carmela Coyle said. "While we're hiring more, we
need even more than we can hire."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, part of the industry's recent expansion is
attributable to a consumer backlash against managed care and the
partial restoration of Medicare funds previously cut by Congress.
With the recession pinching employer profits and government revenues,
both windfalls could prove temporary.</TE>
<TE>   "Only about a third of hospitals in this country are financially
sound," said Gary Mecklenburg, chief executive of Northwestern
Memorial Health Care in Chicago and chairman of the hospital
association's National Workforce Commission. "If you don't have the
revenue, you can't hire and pay the people."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aging Baby Boomers Will Fuel More Growth</TE>
<TE>   If not for the financial squeeze, Mecklenburg said, the industry
could grow even faster.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for health services is rising inexorably in response to a
growing population of elderly Americans and to dramatic advances in
medical technology and therapies. Spending on health care totaled
$1.3 trillion last year, accounting for 13% of the entire U.S.
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an ever-expanding health-care system on which we're
spending ever more money, and the only issue is how fast it will
grow," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
nonprofit research group. "The managed-care movement put a damper on
that for a while, and now the lid's off again."</TE>
<TE>   The importance of health care to the U.S. economy will grow even
greater as the massive baby boom generation enters its golden years.
Although the first wave of boomers are just in their 50s, they are
beginning to suffer the indignities of heart disease and high blood
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just beginning to get the front end of the baby boomers
into ages where they start to get chronic diseases," said Alan M.
Garber, director of Stanford University's Center for Health Policy.
"That's going to increase the demand for all kinds of health
services."</TE>
<TE>   Other trends are contributing to the industry's growth spurt.
Millions of Americans who enrolled in HMOs and other managed-care
organizations became increasingly resentful of the limits placed on
their access to health care. Many abandoned HMOs for less restrictive
plans, increasing demand for medical procedures and hospital
services.</TE>
<TE>   The backlash prompted insurers and employers to ease up on
restrictions. Health-care spending increased, and providers used some
of the funds to hire more people.</TE>
<TE>   "The ongoing fight between the consumers and the gatekeepers
tilted a little bit toward the consumer," said economist Jared
Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented think
tank. "People are accessing the kinds of treatments that a few years
ago insurers might have managed to keep them from getting."</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Congress restored a portion of the Medicare
funding it had taken away in 1997 to help balance the federal budget,
and cracked down on abuses in the government health plan that were
costing taxpayers. Slightly opening the spigot helped shore up
hospital finances after several years of painful cost cutting.</TE>
<TE>   The health-care industry "went through its own sort of
mini-recession in 1999 and 2000," said economist Mark Zandi of
Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. "It had to
restructure and downsize and consolidate. The industry rationalized
itself, and the remaining players are much stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the industry's ability to hire new workers actually was
enhanced by the broader recession. The collapse of the technology
industry, successive waves of corporate layoffs and the shock waves
from the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
increased interest in health- care jobs that previously went
unfilled.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Retired Nurses Reentering Work Force</TE>
<TE>   The crossover effect has been greatest among nonprofessionals such
as administrative aides, admissions clerks, housekeepers and food
service workers.</TE>
<TE>   But the economic slump also has helped health-care providers
address the shortages of trained personnel. Although dot-com refugees
can't be transformed into radiology technicians overnight, the
downturn has caused some retired nurses to reenter the work force and
some part timers to go on full-time schedules. In many cases, it is
because their spouses have become victims of the recession.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good rule of thumb: The supply of health-care
professionals is inversely related to the state of the economy," said
Michael D. Israel, CEO of Duke University Hospital in Durham, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's a two-edged sword. More people are getting laid off,
therefore there are going to be more health professionals available,"
Israel said. "Here's the bad news: Because all those other people got
laid off, those health professionals are going to be treating people
who no longer have insurance coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Although many of the new hires are lower-wage workers--taking
positions they had spurned as undesirable during the good
economy--industry officials say at least a few are highly trained
personnel who left health care during the boom days of the late 1990s
for more lucrative, or less stressful, positions in technology and
other industries.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been able to hire a lot of those people in the last year or
15 months; well-qualified people who weren't available to us a year
ago because the dot-coms were alive," said David Levinsohn, chief
executive of Sherman Oaks Hospital. "Those people have lost their
jobs and they're now seeking jobs in health care."</TE>
<TE>   "In the late '90s, no one would work for hospitals, because if you
could breathe at all, you could go to a dot-com company and they
would give you stock options," Princeton University health-care
economist Uwe Reinhardt said. "When there was a lunatic industry that
would pay you a lot for just standing vertically, why work in a
hospital as a critical care nurse?"</TE>
<TE>   The need for employees is creating intense competition among
potential employers. Hospitals are hosting job fairs, offering $5,000
signing bonuses and bidding up wage scales. The median annual salary
of registered nurses across the country has risen to nearly $42,000,
from the mid-$30,000 range just a few years ago, according to one
study. In the San Francisco Bay Area, some RNs are being offered as
much as $65,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Acute Shortages in Some Health-Care Fields</TE>
<TE>   "There's a shortage in San Diego, there's one in Los Angeles,
there's one in Atlanta and New York and Chicago," said Lee Johnson,
owner of Casa Palmera nursing home in Del Mar, Calif. "Call San
Francisco. Call Omaha. Call Milwaukee. It's the same all over."</TE>
<TE>   Like the nearby Magnolia Special Care center, Casa Palmera is
paying former minimum-wage workers about $7 an hour while they train
to become CNAs.</TE>
<TE>   "They promised us that if we graduate and pass the board exam,
we'll jump up to $10," said Albert Ruivivar, who enrolled in the Casa
Palmera program after he was laid off by a San Diego firm that makes
shafts for golf clubs.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a long way to go to alleviate acute shortages of
health- care personnel.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by the American Hospital Assn. found that 168,000
positions were unfilled in mid-2001. Of those, 126,000 were for RNs,
who are chronically in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   High vacancy rates also were reported for hospital pharmacists,
radiology technologists and laboratory technologists.</TE>
<TE>   A separate study by the American Health Care Assn. found that the
nation's nursing homes have more than 100,000 unfilled job slots:
about 16,200 for RNs, 25,500 for licensed practical nurses and 65,000
for CNAs.</TE>
<TE>   "Five and six months ago, when the economy was robust, we had
members who were giving people a $500 bonus if they'd stay for a
year, a round-trip ticket to Hawaii if they stayed six months, and
$50 if they would bring a friend in just to fill out an application,"
said Betsy Hite, public affairs director for the California Assn. of
Health Facilities, which represents 1,600 nursing homes. "Our classes
for new recruits are filling up more quickly now."</TE>
<TE>   The staff shortages have been exacerbated by demographic trends
within the industry itself. The average age of nurses is rising along
with that of the people they treat, and there are not enough young
people entering the profession to take their places.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the partial restoration of the 1997 Medicare cuts, many
hospitals are losing money.</TE>
<TE>   For "safety-net" institutions that care for large numbers of
indigent patients, the outlook is particularly grim: The recession is
forcing many states to curtail spending on Medicaid, the health-care
program for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some experts fear that Congress may be unintentionally
setting up the industry for another fall by failing to help the
states avert big cuts in Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge threat," said Northwestern Memorial's Mecklenburg,
who just stepped down as chairman of the American Hospital Assn.
"When demand for health care for the indigent is rising because of a
bad economy, it's one of the worst times to cut back funding."</TE>

<HD>Enron Legal Foe Finds Its Tactics Under Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Courts: A probe of his law firm could hamper William
Lerach's bid to represent the energy giant's shareholders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The unfolding Enron mess should be William Lerach's finest hour, a
chance for the nation's top litigator of shareholder class-action
suits to take center stage in one of the largest corporate scandals
in history.</LD>
<LD>   Lerach's firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach, appeared to
be poised to grab control of the Enron shareholder litigation,
proceedings that will showcase plaintiffs' lawyers at a time when the
growing crisis in corporate accounting practices, restated earnings
and tumbling stock prices could trigger more demand for their
services.</LD>
<LD>   But now Lerach's 190-member firm is under a cloud that could
undermine his campaign to win appointment as the lead law firm
representing Enron shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   Two days after Lerach made a splash in Houston with a box of
shredded Enron documents, it was leaked to the news media that a
federal grand jury in Los Angeles was investigating Milberg Weiss in
connection with possible improper payments to shareholders enlisted
for suits.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation reportedly stemmed from information provided by
Beverly Hills eye surgeon Steven G. Cooperman after he was convicted
in 1999 of arranging the theft of a Picasso and Monet from his home
and defrauding Lloyds of London of $12.5 million. Cooperman, who is
serving a 37-month prison sentence, was one of a group of
shareholders who were named as plaintiffs in several shareholder
suits filed by Milberg Weiss.</TE>
<TE>   Milberg Weiss has acknowledged the probe and said it would
cooperate. But its principals, including Lerach, have declined to
comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers on both sides of the shareholder lawsuit business said the
timing of the leak had a political whiff about it, although none of
them would speak for attribution.</TE>
<TE>   Lerach was a major contributor to former President Clinton
political campaign. Assistant U.S. Atty. Mike Emmick, a former member
of Ken Starr's investigative team that looked into Clinton's Monica
Lewinsky affair, is one of two prosecutors working with the grand
jury in the Milberg Weiss probe.</TE>
<TE>   A former federal prosecutor said there are so many other remedies
for the allegations reportedly under investigation, including bar
association and civil sanctions, that a criminal prosecution doesn't
make sense. "I think it's so clearly politically motivated," he said.
"Think of how many cases the U.S. attorney has ever brought against
[lawyers], not to mention big law firms. I can barely think of any."</TE>
<TE>   A corporate defense lawyer said he would be surprised if the firm
had done anything illegal. "I think the Milberg Weiss lawyers are
pretty smart, and they know what they're doing," he said. Lerach is
"very talented. He's a true believer in what he does. And I think
they're a creative, entrepreneurial group. He's obviously on a lot of
people's enemies lists."</TE>
<TE>   Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles, refused to comment directly on the reported investigation.
But speaking generally, he said, "The United States attorney's office
does not initiate criminal investigations based on any political
motivation."</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure of the grand jury investigation came at a critical
time in Lerach's campaign to win the firm's appointment as lead
counsel in the shareholders' case against Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "There's tremendous jockeying," said Trey Davis, a spokesman for
the University of California board of regents, which lost $145
million on its Enron investment and has retained Lerach's firm to
represent the institution. "Milberg Weiss is the preeminent firm to
handle a securities fraud case of this magnitude," he said. "We're
talking about the largest financial scandal in American
history--billions and billions of dollars in losses."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the regents retained Milberg Weiss in December, about a
month before word of the grand jury investigation leaked out, but
they were not concerned about it. "Milberg Weiss has assured us that
there is no merit to the inquiry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The contests among plaintiffs' lawyers for status as lead counsel
can be as hard fought as the cases against the corporations
themselves. The lead law firm gets to run the case and take home the
lion's share of fees, which can total as much as a third of any
settlement or judgment.</TE>
<TE>   In pursuit of the Enron case, Milberg Weiss posted news releases
and updates about the litigation on its Web site, inviting aggrieved
shareholders to click to join the fray.</TE>
<TE>   Lerach set up a command post in a Houston hotel in Enron's
backyard, posing for the media with a box of shredded Enron
documents. It was quintessential Lerach. The firm's most famous and
controversial partner was doing what he does best--championing
shareholder rights and staking his claim to what could be the biggest
case of investor loss in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron debacle is exactly the type of corporate transgression
that Lerach, 55, has made a career pursuing since he left a
Pittsburgh corporate defense firm in 1976 and crossed to the other
side. The son of a Pittsburgh salesman clobbered in the stock market
crash of 1929, Lerach joined the New York-based firm Melvyn I. Weiss
co-founded in 1965 and opened "Milberg West," the firm's West Coast
offices, in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Lerach did not pioneer the class-action shareholder suit, but he
developed the legal tactic into a highly lucrative business model.
The firm made nearly $700 million in profit during the 1990s,
according to evidence presented in a trial. Lerach and Weiss each
took home about $100 million during that period.</TE>
<TE>   "Mel Weiss really started the first cases, but Bill Lerach took it
to new heights," said Wayne W. Smith, a corporate defense lawyer in
Orange County. "Bill Lerach is a very smart individual and a very
tough individual, and he really single-handedly drove the huge
expansion in these types of lawsuits. Others saw his success and
wanted to emulate him. He really was the dominant force. Still is."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate executives who've been "Lerached"--hit with a
shareholder suit filed by any lawyer--hold him in special regard.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Lerach is among the most disliked, if not hated, figures in
the trial bar by people in corporate America," said James M. Wootton,
president of the U.S. Chamber's Institute for Legal Reform. "A lot of
people view it as an extortion racket, where the lawsuits are filed
in the hope that ... settlement will be needed to protect the brand
of the corporation," Wootton said. "There are those who believe he's
perfected the art of milking the most out of the extortion value of
the lawsuits."</TE>
<TE>   Lerach "strikes the fear of God into most corporations," said Jeff
Christian, chief executive of Christian &amp; Timbers, an international
executive search firm based in Cleveland. "But what he does, he's the
best at. You can't knock being the best, even if you don't agree with
the tactics, the strategy or the business model. In corporate
America, he is seen as the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   Lerach lives in a villa on 11 acres in Rancho Santa Fe and works
out of offices in a high-rise with views of San Diego's harbor. He is
a big contributor to Democratic politicians and spoke to the former
president at a White House dinner four days before Clinton vetoed the
1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, which was aimed
squarely at Lerach.</TE>
<TE>   Congress mustered the votes to override the veto, enabling the
bill to become law. Among other things, the reform act limits the
frequency with which a shareholder could serve as lead plaintiff to
five times in three years. Because the lead counsel appointment
almost always goes to the law firm that represents the shareholder
who is named lead plaintiff, that change was aimed at curbing
lawyers' use of so-called professional plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   Before the reform act, filing first was often all it took for a
lawyer to persuade a judge to name his client lead plaintiff and his
firm lead counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "The price of the stock drops, and the next morning, somebody is
standing there ready to file a claim," Smith said. "We always said,
'How do you suppose between yesterday and today they got a
shareholder to file a suit?' Everybody wonders, because you don't
really know how these plaintiffs magically appear."</TE>
<TE>   The reform act sought to deter such races to the courthouse by
giving priority for lead plaintiff status to the shareholder or group
of shareholders with the biggest losses. Initially, many lawyers
responded to the reform act by resolving among themselves any
disputes over lead counsel, hammering out a deal and presenting the
agreement to judges, who often approved.</TE>
<TE>   "There was chaos until all the plaintiffs' firms would emerge with
an agreement, and generally Milberg Weiss would emerge as the lead
firm, passing out work to other firms as desired," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Milberg Weiss has a bigger share of the shareholder
lawsuit pie than the firm had before the securities reform act.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Milberg Weiss was responsible for 35% of the suits filed
outside California, said Bill Ballowe, who tracks such activity for
Woodruff &amp; Sawyer, a San Francisco-based insurance broker. Milberg
Weiss' share of federal shareholder suits more than doubled to 72% by
2000, although it dipped to 60% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Within California, Milberg Weiss has dominated shareholder suits
for years, handling 65% to 85% of them, Ballowe said.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe the tougher pleading standards and other hurdles
imposed by the reform act actually helped Milberg Weiss, which, with
greater financial resources than other firms, has been better able to
mount a complex prosecution and wait out contingency fee paydays.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of the shareholder suits settle, according to a study by
two Northern California economists who often testify on behalf of
defendant corporations. Milberg Weiss settles slightly more of its
cases, 63%, according to that study, and the firm settles on average
for 15% of potential investor losses, slightly less than other firms,
which average 17%.</TE>
<TE>   The findings add to the debate over whose interests are being
served by the shareholder suits, said Mukesh Bajaj, a managing
director of LECG, an Emeryville, Calif.-based economics firm, and
coauthor of the study.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of concern that these lawsuits have simply become
a game by which lawyers sue firms, get rich quick, and insurance
premiums go up,'' Bajaj said. "It's not clear that these lawsuits are
serving a meaningful function in deterring wrongdoers, because what
you typically find is these cases settle and they settle within the
insurance limit. And everyone moves on. The company doesn't
necessarily suffer any ill effect of such wrongdoing.''</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember the savings and loan crisis? From my perspective, my
profession is responsible. Enron Corp. is no different ["Enron Will
Spur Reform but More Is Needed," James Flanigan, Jan. 27].</LD>
<LD>   Certified public accountants have forgotten how to do their jobs.
When I started in the early 1970s, the primary responsibility of CPAs
was to ensure that financial statements were not misleading.</LD>
<LD>   Practically all financial statements today are in fact misleading.
But the real underlying problem is the cutthroat bidding and cost
cutting for audit pricing. Audit pricing at all levels is underbid
and sold below cost.</LD>
<TE>   I recently lost two audits to competing bids that were half the
fee I had bid. There was no practical way another CPA could audit
these entities for less.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Microsoft Corp.'s Securities and Exchange Commission
statement said it paid $5 million for audit fees. At an average $200
per hour, that amounts to 25,000 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Assume an average 2,000 hours for one full-time auditor, and that
equals 12.5 auditors working all year to audit a multinational,
multibillion-dollar business.</TE>
<TE>   There is no practical way 12 people could keep up with the
hundreds of accounting staff at Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that we all get exactly what we pay for. I hope
that the Enron fiasco will bring real practical auditing back to
business.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the subjects that you didn't touch on is the need for
immediate and dramatic change in corporate tax shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Large accounting firms (primarily the Big Five) have been
promoting corporate tax shelters for the past few years. (I noticed
Enron hasn't paid any income taxes for four out of the past five
years.) They have been going to clients and non-clients and telling
them they can structure a deal under which they won't have to pay any
income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these shelters are way past the "gray" areas of the tax
code. These accounting firms are not passive participants in these
shelters. They are actively promoting them to anyone who will listen.</TE>
<TE>   Having practiced on both sides of that equation, I have seen that
the size of the CPA firm makes very little difference with regard to
the influence that companies exert over their outside accountants. It
really comes down to the integrity of the people involved.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Beware the 401(k) Gamble" [Jan. 24] says, "Working people have
turned the stock market into their retirement system, and themselves,
rather than their corporate employers, into retirement money
managers."</LD>
<LD>   I wish that, as an employee, I had this much choice; rather, it is
the employer who determines the retirement compensation program.</LD>
<LD>   My only choice is whether to participate. Recently, my employer
announced a new plan that allegedly will provide me with more money
on retirement and offer me more control over that money.</LD>
<TE>   However, the plan's success depends on that of the stock market. I
realize that I have the chance for more money, but I also am aware
that I have the chance for far less. What if neither my company nor
Social Security comes through for me?</TE>
<TE>   While I believe that the public should be informed of the dangers
of both 401(k)-type plans and pensions, equal time should be given to
other options.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals should do as much as possible to secure a worry-free
retirement, and that means depending on oneself as well as one's
employer or government.</TE>

<HD>Put on Extra Debt During Holidays? Time to Shed It</HD>
<DH>Consumers loaded with big credit card balances need to take
quick action so the hole doesn't get any deeper.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>February can be a make-or-break month for indebted consumers.</LD>
<LD>   "By that time, most of the charge card statements have found their
way to mail boxes," said Paul Richards, executive director of the
Institute of Consumer Financial Education in San Diego. "That's when
folks realize just how badly they behaved over the holidays."</LD>
<LD>   The rising tide of layoffs and declining opportunities for earning
overtime pay could make this February the most difficult in years for
consumers with heavy debt loads, experts say. Consumer debt grew at a
record pace in November and late payments hit a three-year high--and
that was before the Christmas holidays.</LD>
<TE>   "Some people cut down on their spending a bit, but a lot of people
who didn't have money to start with probably went deeper into debt,"
said Kristy Welsh, president and editor of CreditInfoCenter.com and
author of "Good Credit is Sexy" (Techartists Publishing, 2001).</TE>
<TE>   Consumers who find themselves overwhelmed by holiday debts need to
take quick action, Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing is to get yourself operating on cash, so you don't
continue in that downward spiral into indebtedness," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a five-step process for getting out of debt:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Step One: Assess  Your Situation</TE>
<TE>   Make a list of your credit card bills and their minimum monthly
payments, as well as the interest rate and the total amount owed on
each card. Add up the minimum payments and the amount owed.</TE>
<TE>   Do you have nonretirement savings sufficient to pay off the debts?
If so, use it--especially if it's sitting in a low-yielding bank
account or money market fund. Earning single-digit interest on your
savings while paying double-digit interest on your debts is folly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Step Two: Create  a Repayment Plan</TE>
<TE>   If you can't pay off your debts immediately, compare your minimum
monthly credit card payments to your discretionary income--what's
left after the mortgage, car payment and other required monthly bills
are paid. If your discretionary income is higher than your minimum
payments, use the extra cash to begin paying off the debts. (If you
have more bills than income, skip to Step Three.)</TE>
<TE>   There are two common repayment strategies, Richards said. One is
to make only minimum payments on most debts and use whatever money is
left at the end of each month to pay down the balance on the card
with the highest interest rate. When that card is paid off, attack
the balance on the second-highest-rate card, and so on until every
credit card is paid off.</TE>
<TE>   The other strategy is to pick off the low-balance cards first,
Richards said. This provides a psychological boost to those who need
to see progress, but it's not as effective as getting rid of the
high-rate cards first, Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Step Three: Trim Discretionary Spending</TE>
<TE>   If the total of your minimum payments is more than your available
funds, look for ways to cut your spending. Take an hour to jot down a
simple household budget, indicating how much money comes in each
month and where it goes.</TE>
<TE>   Look first at discretionary spending--everything that doesn't have
to be paid each month--and try to find ways to cut reduce it, said
Matt Coffin, chief executive of LowerMyBills.com.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, if you have cable TV, ask your provider to suspend
your account for several months. Most cable companies will allow
customers to temporarily stop service, which could save you $30 to
$50 a month that could be applied against the credit card bills. The
same holds true for gym memberships.</TE>
<TE>   Can't live without cable or your workout? Consider firing the
maid, washing your own car or going out to eat less often, Coffin
suggested. Giving up every luxury might be unrealistic. But most
families can trim at least some minor expenses that could provide
money to whittle down the credit card bills.</TE>
<TE>   Be particularly careful about late fees, Coffin added. Whether
it's paying the bills or returning rented videos, being a day late
costs money and provides nothing of value.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Step Four: Bargain Hunt for Necessities</TE>
<TE>   If you haven't shopped for auto insurance, homeowners insurance or
long-distance phone service recently, you probably could save money
if you did, Coffin said. Also, anyone paying monthly service charges
on a basic bank account might save money by switching to an online
bank.</TE>
<TE>   Using coupons for grocery shopping also can save money. Richards
said the 20 minutes he spends clipping coupons from the Sunday
newspaper saves him hundreds of dollars a year.</TE>
<TE>   Dry cleaning, auto supplies and tools also are available at
discount prices if you're willing to shop around, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the negative issues--the idea of having to cut
back," Richards said. "I prefer to get more value for the dollar. All
that takes is some comparison shopping."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Step Five: Stay on Track</TE>
<TE>   You don't need to cut up your credit cards if you've overspent--in
fact, that could hurt your credit rating and cost you money in the
long run, Welsh said. But you should make a point of keeping your
spending in line.</TE>
<TE>   The best-case scenario is to pay off your credit card balance
every month. If you must carry a balance, confine it to one card with
the lowest rate you qualify for.</TE>
<TE>   Never go over your credit limits and never pay your bills late,
Welsh said. If you do, you'll get hit with penalty fees. Moreover, it
hurts your credit rating, which gives lenders reason to hike the
interest rates on your debts, putting you even further behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Once people get behind, they get bad credit and then the interest
rates on their credit cards get higher and they just get poorer,"
Coffin said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have debt, make a few sacrifices now. Otherwise, you'll
never get out from under it and you never get ahead."</TE>

<LD>Optimism Growing About Economy</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. economy offered tantalizing new hints that it may be
recovering faster than expected as the January unemployment rate
slipped to 5.6% and employers shed jobs at the slowest pace in five
months.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, an industry report shows the nation's battered
manufacturing sector expanding production and collecting new orders
for a second straight month, breaking almost a year-and-a-half-long
string of setbacks.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a surge in auto sales and a sharp increase in
government spending helped the U.S. economy grow in the final three
months of last year at a 0.2% annual rate.</TE>
<TE>   But no one, including notoriously optimistic investors, is popping
the champagne yet.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the decline in the jobless rate is accompanied by
an inexplicably large plunge in the size of America's labor force and
by figures showing that a record number of jobless workers have
exhausted their unemployment compensation benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market certainly didn't do much trumpeting.</TE>
<TE>   Worried that accounting scandals like that at Enron Corp. may lurk
in the wings, investors treated the new employment report as if it
showed the recovery will be slower, not faster, in coming and pushed
stock prices down.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.7%, the
Nasdaq lost 1.4%, and the S&amp;P 500 eased 1%. Year to date, the Dow is
off 1.1%, the Nasdaq dropped 2% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 2.3%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GAO to Sue White House Over Energy Records</TE>
<TE>   Setting up a high-stakes legal battle between two branches of the
government, the investigative arm of Congress announced plans to sue
the White House for records of Vice President Dick Cheney's meetings
with Enron Corp. and other industry interests that sought to
influence the administration's energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office said it would file suit in federal
court in the next two or three weeks in an effort to obtain records
of the task force that developed the industry-friendly energy policy
President Bush announced May 17.</TE>
<TE>   The filing would mark the first time in the GAO's 80-year history
that it has sued a federal entity.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has refused to turn over the records on grounds
that doing so would infringe the president's ability to gather
opinions from Americans without fear their comments will be made
public.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fallout Continues From Enron Collapse</TE>
<TE>   The week brought more developments surrounding the collapse of
Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The earliest warning sign yet about Enron's outside investment
partnerships may have come from the company's in-house legal counsel.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Enron legal Vice President Jordan Mintz independently
asked a prominent New York law firm to review the partnerships and
provide legal advice. The resulting opinion, issued six weeks later
by law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, advised Enron
to "halt this practice," according to congressional investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the fallout continued, as Enron's auditor, Andersen,
said it is losing business, but the company's chief executive sought
to dispel speculation that the firm would be sold or shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Joseph F. Berardino said Andersen's destruction of
Enron-related papers and alleged accounting lapses are marring the
company's credibility and scaring off potential clients.</TE>
<TE>   But he declined to identify specific accounts it has lost.</TE>
<TE>   The debate about the potential conflict of interest among major
accounting firms that also sell consulting services to their clients
led four of the Big 5 accounting firms to say they would be willing
to give up at least some of the lucrative consulting work in an
effort to restore confidence in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   That announcement came as Walt Disney Co. became the first major
U.S. corporation to say it no longer would use its outside accounting
firm for new consulting projects and would review those underway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Sinks in a Sea of Debt</TE>
<TE>   In the second major bankruptcy filing in two weeks, Global
Crossing Ltd., which built the world's largest communications network
under the ocean, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   The filing, which listed more than $12 billion in debt, followed
that of Kmart Corp. a week earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's filing was a huge setback for founder Gary
Winnick, a feisty former bond trader who was crowned the richest man
in Los Angeles in 1999 when his stake in the company grew to be worth
$6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy filing included a plan by an investment group led
by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing to pump $750 million into the
company to keep it afloat.</TE>
<TE>   But that was little consolation for the company's creditors and
shareholders, who stand to recover little, if any, of their
investments.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a former Global Crossing finance executive said he
warned the firm's top attorney in August that the company's financial
condition was being enhanced with misleading accounting techniques.</TE>
<TE>   He said he repeatedly raised concerns about the company's
accounting on specific deals starting in June. But the company denied
Roy Olofson's accusations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Big Blue's CEO to Step Down</TE>
<TE>   The chief executive who transformed once-battered IBM Corp. into a
steadily profitable technology behemoth is stepping down.</TE>
<TE>   Louis V. Gerstner Jr. said he would turn the reins over to Chief
Operating Officer and 29-year IBM veteran Sam Palmisano on March 1,
Gerstner's 60th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstner, the first outsider to lead IBM in eight decades, joined
Big Blue in 1993, when it was mired in a bloated bureaucracy that
spoke its own language.</TE>
<TE>   Obsessed with selling big computers, the company was losing
billions and facing investor demands that it split into pieces.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Craig Gains Investment Group</TE>
<TE>   Diet center operator Jenny Craig Inc. agreed to sell itself to
private investment group ACI Capital Co. for $115 million, or $5.30 a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Sid and Jenny Craig, the husband-and-wife team who founded the
company and control 67% of its shares, will receive $73 million as a
result of the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   The Craigs will continue to hold a $4-million stake in the La
Jolla-based company but will not be involved in its management; Sid
Craig will remain on the company's board.</TE>
<TE>   Named to succeed Sid Craig as chairman and chief executive was
Kent Kreh, a former chief executive of Weight Watchers International
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toys R Us to Close Stores, Cut Jobs</TE>
<TE>   Toys R Us Inc. said it is cutting 1,900 jobs and closing 64
domestic stores in a move to speed modernization of its aging stores
and recoup customers lost to smaller rivals and giant merchants such
as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The move is part of a broader effort by the nation's
second-largest toy seller to reverse a market-share decline by making
its stores more compelling and its merchandise mix unique.</TE>
<TE>   Investors reacted positively to the plan, driving the stock up 4%
for the week.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say that more needs to be done and that the slow pace
of change has resulted in further customer defections.</TE>
<TE>   The company, based in Paramus, N.J., said it plans to shutter 27
of its older-style Toys R Us stores and 37 of its troubled Kids R Us
stores.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gullible Investors Scammed Straight</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is using bogus investment
Web sites in an effort to slap a little sense into the terminally
gullible.</TE>
<TE>   The commission created www.mcwhortle.com, a Web address for bogus
company McWhortle Enterprises Inc., which supposedly makes
battery-powered biohazard detection devices.</TE>
<TE>   The site, replete with faux testimonials and audio feeds, promises
that investments in McWhortle will be worth 400 times the initial
offering price within three months.</TE>
<TE>   But when investors hit the button to buy, up pops a page
proclaiming: "If you responded to an investment idea like this, you
could get scammed!"</TE>
<TE>   The site received more than 150,000 hits last month after a news
release seemingly issued by McWhortle Enterprises was distributed to
hundreds of Web sites.</TE>

<HD>Sources: SEC Didn't Keep a Close Watch on Enron</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOYLE McMANUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission, the watchdog agency set up to
protect investors, did not formally review Enron Corp.'s financial
statements for at least three years, from 1998 until the company
began to collapse last year, sources familiar with the SEC said last
week.</LD>
<LD>   During that period, Enron concealed hundreds of millions of
dollars in costs, inflating its profit and boosting its stock
price--all without serious scrutiny from the SEC.</LD>
<LD>   In thousands of cases every year, the SEC focuses its scrutiny on
the financial statements of public companies when it believes
something is amiss.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC reviewed filings from 3,595 companies last year, about 30%
of those that filed information, according to the commission's annual
report. But 1,195 of those reviews looked at firms that were offering
stock publicly for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Among some 10,000 already established companies that filed reports
with the SEC, 2,400 were reviewed--about one in four.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the SEC didn't monitor Enron was just business as
usual, former commission officials and other SEC watchers say. The
agency relies mostly on private-sector accountants, investors and
even the news media to bring serious problems to its attention.</TE>
<TE>   "The kind of digging that would have to have been done [to detect
Enron's flaws] is not ordinarily undertaken by the SEC staff," said
Arthur Levitt Jr., SEC chairman from 1993 to 2001. "The SEC doesn't
do that. It can't do it."</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the agency has only about 90 accountants to review
the financial statements that flood in, quarter after quarter, from
about 12,000 companies.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those accountants focus on examining corporations that are
selling stock to the public for the first time, not established
companies such as Enron, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Enron debacle," as SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt calls it, has
prompted the commission to change its ways. Last month, the SEC
quietly announced that its staff would read the annual report of
every Fortune 500 company this year, something it wasn't doing
before.</TE>
<TE>   In that new review, the SEC will pay special attention to any
financial report that "seems to conflict significantly with generally
accepted accounting principles ... or to be materially deficient in
explanation or clarity," a statement said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear whether that level of scrutiny, if applied to
Enron's annual reports from 1999 through 2001, would have prompted a
more extensive review of the energy company's finances.</TE>
<TE>   "A review could have caught the problems," said a former official
who spoke only on condition of anonymity. "There's no guarantee that
it would have. But it would have been better to have a review than a
no-review."</TE>
<TE>   The commission refuses to say whether its staff looked seriously
at any of Enron's annual reports or other financial statements during
those years, citing a policy of strict confidentiality.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC launched a formal investigation of Enron's accounting in
October. But that was only after the company announced that it was
making a gigantic correction on its balance sheet, a public admission
that something was terribly wrong: a cut of $1.2 billion in
shareholder equity, stemming from hidden deals with limited
partnerships controlled by the company's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Selective Review Policy</TE>
<TE>   As far back as September 2000, a few skeptical stock analysts,
financial experts and investors were raising questions about Enron's
financial structure. Enron President Jeffrey K. Skilling derided the
critics as thickheaded, and called one of them an obscenity in an
April 2001 conference call with fund managers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the danger signs, former officials and lawyers familiar
with the SEC's inner workings say there is no indication that the
commission launched an official review of Enron, a formal step short
of an investigation, before October.</TE>
<TE>   Such reviews are kept confidential, but they often result in
corrections or changes to a firm's financial statements that must be
made public.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's 1997 financial statements were the last to be reviewed,
according to former SEC officials. The Wall Street Journal has
reported that Enron's 2000 report was scheduled for a review, but the
SEC staff postponed the process for a year to wait for more data on
the company's trading in derivatives. SEC spokesmen refused to
comment on that report or to say when Enron's filings were last
reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC staff chooses what companies to examine under a policy
called "selective review," but spokesmen refused to say what criteria
are used in that process.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot like the Internal Revenue Service," the former
official said. "Not every tax return is audited; not every filing by
every public company is reviewed."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC applies a list of criteria to companies to decide whether
their filings should trigger a review, he said, including sudden
changes in a company's fortunes--either up or down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Too Many Balls in Air</TE>
<TE>   In addition to those criteria, the SEC attempts to review every
public company's financial statements at least once every four years.
But even then the staff cannot review all the filings that qualify.</TE>
<TE>   "The workload is just too high," the former reviewer said. "There
are more filings that get triggered than can physically be
reviewed....It's not a question of the [staff] dropping the ball;
it's a question of how many balls they already have in the air."</TE>
<TE>   After the SEC investigation was announced in October and more
accounting problems came to light in November, the confidence of
Enron's creditors and investors collapsed. The company filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, wiping out billions of
dollars in equity held by investors, employees and retirees.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath, attention has focused on Enron's officers, its
board of directors and its auditors for producing dishonest financial
statements.</TE>
<TE>   But the SEC's failure to intervene earlier also has renewed a
long-running debate over the commission's size and the limits of its
regulatory power.</TE>
<TE>   On one side is Levitt, a Clinton appointee who ran the SEC during
much of the time Enron was submitting misleading financial reports;
he worries that the commission wasn't aggressive enough.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side is Pitt, appointed chairman in August by
President Bush, who believes that the commission was too aggressive
under Levitt--so aggressive that companies concentrated on disclosing
as little as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The two SEC chairmen, former and current, have been arguing the
point for years--and Enron's collapse has only fueled the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we had pursued some of these problems more aggressively,"
Levitt said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Levitt said the SEC was not reviewing financial statements
rigorously enough, largely because it doesn't have enough staff.</TE>
<TE>   "The enforcement division was denied 35 spaces last year because
of budget cuts," he said. "The average number of times a company gets
their statements reviewed is once every four years."</TE>
<TE>   Also, the SEC's computers are antiquated. "Their systems are in
the dark ages, which further complicates, rather than eases, the
staff's ability to do their work," said Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief
accountant under Levitt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kinder, Gentler SEC</TE>
<TE>   But Pitt, a prominent securities lawyer, proposes a different
remedy. Instead of major increases in spending, staffing or review,
Pitt has said he wants to establish a "kinder and gentler"
relationship with the companies the SEC regulates.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt has said he believes that the SEC can be effective only if
auditors and company officers feel comfortable bringing problems to
the commission when they first arise, without fear that they might
touch off a punishing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The debate will play out in Congress over the next few months as
several committees investigate whether the SEC dropped the ball on
Enron, and whether the commission's budget or powers should be
expanded.</TE>
<TE>   But the accounting industry and other business lobbies have fought
against expanded SEC power for years, and few members of Congress
have shown much appetite for the issue so far.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration also has been silent. The president's
budget proposal would increase SEC funding by a modest 4% overall,
including a 6% increase for enforcement, officials said. But that is
well below the proposals of critics such as Rep. John J. LaFalce
(D-N.Y.), who has proposed doubling the commission's budget.</TE>

<HD>War Is Handy Politics for Bush</HD>

<LD>We have won the war in Afghanistan, but President Bush refuses to
declare victory. Why he won't is not a mystery. Congress has not
authorized a global war against all rogue states, and once the
president recognizes that the Afghan war is over, his larger
ambitions lack adequate legal foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Inflated war talk is a defining characteristic of the modern
presidency; recall the war against poverty, the war against crime,
the war against drugs. Martial rhetoric is a response to our system
of separated powers. Congress notoriously checks and balances and
eviscerates most presidential initiatives. But by calling something a
war, the commander in chief might get the House of Representatives
and Senate to defer to him in the way it does when a real war is
going on.</LD>
<LD>   War talk is particularly tempting just after a real war, if only a
small one, has ended. It allows the president to maintain
extraordinary wartime powers and to wrap his wartime popularity
around programs that are linked to real war only metaphorically.</LD>
<TE>   Terrorism will be a recurring problem of the 21st century.
Technology allows small bands of zealots to wreak havoc. Despite our
best efforts, tragedies on the scale of Sept. 11 will happen again.
But mindless talk of war only prevents clear thinking about the
problem, confusing the domestic and international aspects of our
situation. For all we know, the next terrorist attack will come from
a band of American extremists, as in Oklahoma City and maybe in the
case of anthrax. Suppose that some group gases the subways of San
Francisco or poisons Chicago's water supply. Is the president's "war
against terrorism" appropriate against domestic extremists?</TE>
<TE>   More than four months after Sept. 11, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
refuses to reveal the names of all of the more than 1,100 suspected
terrorists he has swept into detention. Are U.S. citizens to be
subject to such secret detention? Bush has asserted his power as
commander in chief to short-circuit the civilian courts and try
foreign terrorists by military tribunals. Will he attempt a similar
power play if the next battle against terrorism turns out to be on
the home front? If so, one hopes that Americans will resist this
invasion of each citizen's fundamental rights to due process.</TE>
<TE>   Our collective perspicacity will be tested sooner on the
international front. In his State of the Union address, Bush
explicitly targeted Iran, Iraq and North Korea as potential enemies.
But Congress has not given him carte blanche to extend the Afghan war
to these other targets. Its joint resolution falls far short of the
classic declaration of war. It simply allows him "to use all
necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations
or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided
terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Since the resolution restricts itself to Sept. 11, the
administration has tried to find evidence of rogue states'
involvement in these particular attacks. But this effort has been
unsuccessful. The State of the Union declaration looks like a trial
balloon. If Bush's continuing war talk is accepted at face value,
perhaps the public will allow him to begin a new war against Iraq or
Iran without returning for another authorization from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   We confront serious foreign policy choices. But once again, the
fog of war talk is obscuring them. The last war is over. Before
embarking on a new one, the president must persuade Congress that the
war is worthwhile and that he has devised appropriate exit strategies
in case of misadventure.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, Bush promised repeatedly to do just this. But now
that he has discovered the political power of the "war on terrorism,"
it will be up to the American people to insist that he keep his
promises.</TE>

<DH>Foreign correspondents risk their lives for freedom.</DH>

<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'll leave it to you to be outraged about the plight of one American
in Pakistan, except to say that the word "evil" seems just about
right.</LD>
<LD>   What I want to do instead is pay tribute. And I'll ask you not to
judge me self-serving even though the tribute is to my colleagues and
this craft. The women and men of our free press risk their lives for
freedom. Sometimes they pay with their lives.</LD>
<LD>   Here's to them. They go to war without guns, without helmets or
night-vision goggles, without fire teams or satellite recon or
buddies at their side or search-and-rescue helicopters at the ready.</LD>
<TE>   Do they do it for the glory? Sure. But, let's not forget, there
would be no glory if there wasn't high purpose too.</TE>
<TE>   They do it because they believe--they know--that the world needs
to know. They go because the rest of us expect them to.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever horrors that humans inflict on each other would be
manifestly worse except for prying eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Every journalist I know has taken comfort from the words of Thomas
Jefferson: "Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a
government without newspapers or newspapers without government, I
should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter."</TE>
<TE>   If you have ever lived in countries where there was no right to
know, you understand what he meant.</TE>
<TE>   So thanks, friends. Thanks for having the guts. And that hardly
says enough. There isn't a story or a photograph or a video clip in
all the world that's worth dying for. Editors always say that as you
walk out the door with a fresh posting in your pocket. Yet you risk
it. And not only that, you're counted on to risk it. Our freedom
rests on your shoulders too.</TE>
<TE>   But those things are never said as you sweep out of the newsroom
with a scruffy satchel slung over your shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "War correspondence is a dangerous business," deadpanned Jon E.
Lewis in his book, "War Correspondents." But, he added, "somebody has
got to do it. Readers demand it. We need it .... Somewhere a war
correspondent is dying to give it to you. "</TE>
<TE>   In this first war of the 21st century, eight journalists have died
so far in search of the story, according to the New York-based
Committee to Protect Journalists. At the deadline for this column,
there were reports that another had been assassinated--an intrepid
38-year-old American who is, or was, about to become a father.
Worldwide, 37 journalists were slain in the line of duty last year.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush expressed his "deep concern" for Daniel Pearl of
the Wall Street Journal. The whole global fraternity of journalists
feels the same.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know Pearl. But I know the type. I've covered wars and
rebellions with dozens like him. I know something about leaving a
wife and a child at home and telling them not to worry.</TE>
<TE>   Once I sat at a table in Bujumbura, Burundi, with half a dozen men
and women like Pearl. We learned that a British television crew had
just been ambushed and killed outside of town. We decided that we
needed to start counting heads each night thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   I owe my life to a South African photojournalist. At a rebel
roadblock in Liberia five years ago, armed teenagers advanced on us
with guns. "Don't you know who I am," said the quick-thinking veteran
of many wars. "I'm Steven Seagal!" The warriors paused, looked
puzzled and then decided, yes, they were in the presence of a
universal celebrity--the cause for a party, not a slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, this photographer's name was Mark Peters. And his motto
expressed the flair that typifies the best of the craft: "Always
smile in the face of danger."</TE>
<TE>   My reminiscences are meant only to let you know that I've lived
and worked among and watched and admired these people who put so much
on the line from so many spooky places under such frightening
circumstances--all of them in the belief that what they did might
make things better by bringing a spotlight into the dark. I always
felt humble in their presence, even when I was alongside. I feel more
so now.</TE>
<TE>   This morning I'll have a hot breakfast in a comfortable chair with
the newspaper in my hands. I'll see those datelines from Pakistan and
Afghanistan and Colombia and Nigeria and Algeria and the chaos of any
of 50 other hot spots. I doubt if they'll be a single word about how
hard and unpleasant it was to obtain these stories. I'm positive that
none of the men and women who report them will ask for our gratitude.
But at a sad time for journalism, I thought we should offer a little
anyway.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>They left town a while ago, but I still follow the Oakland Raiders
pro football team with mild interest. I'm troubled that they're not
playing in today's Super Bowl, but not for the reason hard-core
Raider fans are.</LD>
<LD>   Like millions of TV viewers who saw the Raiders lose a playoff
game to the New England Patriots two weeks ago, I know the Patriots
are in the Super Bowl only because of a referee's bad decision. But
it never surprises me when the National Football League tries to foul
the Raiders. They have been the least-favorite team of NFL bigwigs
since 1982, when they sued the league in federal court to clear the
way for their move to L.A.</LD>
<LD>   My disappointment stems from the fact that if the Raiders were
playing today against the St. Louis Rams, it would have given
hundreds of journalists bored by the NFL's usual pregame hype
something genuinely provocative to write about: the first Super Bowl
involving teams that once called Los Angeles home.</LD>
<TE>   What those sports reporters would have found is that six years
after both teams fled, hardly anybody in Los Angeles misses the
Raiders, the Rams or the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Most of us realized from the very start that the NFL needs L.A.
more than we need it. Nothing that has happened since the Raiders
abandoned the L.A. Memorial Coliseum and the Rams skulked out of
Anaheim Stadium has changed that consensus. Even last year's decision
by NFL owners to put an expansion team in Houston, rather than L.A.,
was shrugged off like a flat tire on the freeway--an annoyance that
slows life in the fast lane temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   And spare me any crocodile tears for the "average" L.A. football
fan, who presumably doesn't share my elitist contempt for the NFL.
Our "average" fan never had it so good. Without a home team to
enforce blackouts of network TV, fans in L.A. see more games--free.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that has not kept the NFL's TV ratings from steadily
declining, much to the chagrin of executives at the TV networks, who
paid beaucoup bucks for broadcast rights.</TE>
<TE>   Those TV types know that some Sundays there are now more soccer
matches on local television than NFL games. They worry that one
reason for the plummeting interest in the NFL here is because L.A.'s
"average" sports fan is more interested in the success of futbol
teams, such as Chivas of Guadalajara or Cruz Azul of Mexico City. The
global sporting event those L.A. fans are looking forward to is not
the Super Bowl or even the upcoming Olympics but soccer's World Cup
tournament in Korea and Japan in June.</TE>
<TE>   The folks who run the Coliseum figured that out long ago. The
stadium has remained profitable by staging international soccer
matches that draw crowds that are as enthusiastic but better behaved
than NFL crowds.</TE>
<TE>   Demographics is destiny, the saying goes. If multicultural L.A. is
a precursor of what other big cities in this country will be, that's
just one more reason Angelenos can patiently wait for NFL honchos to
sneak back into town someday, like snake-oil salesmen looking for new
tricks to help peddle their nostrums.</TE>
<TE>   It could happen as early as 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Chargers are unhappy with their stadium and the
lease that is supposed to keep them there until 2016. Despite the
fact that the lease obligates San Diego to buy all unsold tickets to
home games--a provision that has cost the city more than $25 million
since 1997-- the Chargers are the latest NFL team hinting they might
relocate to L.A. if taxpayers don't build them a new stadium. A
clause in the lease (whoever negotiated that thing for San Diego
should be shot) lets them skip out of town in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   What makes this scenario juicy is the fact that the next Super
Bowl will be played in January 2003 in San Diego. So it will be easy
for journalists to drive a few miles north and write about L.A.'s
nonchalant attitude toward the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   So if you like drama, don't bore yourself watching today's Super
Bowl. Wait 'til next year.</TE>

<HD>Mugabe Will Try to Outfox the World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA HUSARSKA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seen from afar, the struggle of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe to
hold on to power and outfox the outside world looks pathetic if it
were not that his eventual success in the March presidential election
would mean continued dictatorship and famine for his countrymen.</LD>
<LD>   His latest trick is to accept as foreign monitors only citizens
from nations and organizations that he has chosen. Not surprisingly,
the citizens of the United States and Britain are not acceptable;
neither is the Carter Center of Atlanta, which has monitored many
foreign elections. The only American group that is welcome is the
NAACP.</LD>
<LD>   Are we surprised? Not at all. Last August I sat with Morgan
Tsvangerai, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic
Change, or MDC, in his office in Harare and we joked that the panoply
of foreign monitors allowed would be composed of North Koreans,
Burmese, Iraqis, Libyans and perhaps someone from Belarus to give it
an old-continent touch.</LD>
<TE>   Comrade Bob (as Mugabe is known to his fellow war veterans and his
fellow foreign dictators) came up with a more business-oriented
criterion: The countries and organizations allowed to send monitors
all happen to have some trade interests in Zimbabwe. They are
unlikely to come down hard on him for his electoral peccadillos or
his gross violations of human rights, such as having opponents killed
or opposition newspapers bombed.</TE>
<TE>   And to make sure that his sins, small and large, do not get
exposed by the media, Mugabe had a gag law adopted in parliament
Thursday. The so-called Access to Information and Protection of
Privacy bill restricts access for foreign reporters and imposes tight
controls on local media.</TE>
<TE>   So now that Mugabe has warned the media not to be a nuisance, the
coast is clear. Unless he reaches for the ultimate weapon and
declares a state of emergency, which would effectively suspend the
elections and many civil rights, the contest will probably go ahead
March 9 and 10.</TE>
<TE>   What is to be done?</TE>
<TE>   The predictions show that the opposition MDC is a favorite in
these elections. Everything must be done to ensure that Zimbabwe's
people get what they want.</TE>
<TE>   This means monitoring the election process, and monitoring it
well, despite Mugabe's roadblocks. Countries and groups (mostly
African regional trade organizations) doing the "official" monitoring
must be told clearly that they will be treated as accomplices if they
let Comrade Bob get away with crime: killing candidates, dissidents,
journalists or voters, or simply stealing the election by other
means.</TE>
<TE>   Nongovernmental organizations with experience in Zimbabwe
(religious, humanitarian, development groups) must rally all their
members to revisit the country and denounce whatever electoral dirt
they see.</TE>
<TE>   Electoral experts from countries that evolved from similar
dictatorships through elections should send people (with tourist
visas if need be) to discreetly watch and later publicly describe
their observations.</TE>
<TE>   This may not be a "formally accepted" monitoring group but neither
can it be accepted that a dictator handpicks who will watch him do as
he pleases.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to sanctions, travel by Mugabe and Co. to Britain is off
limits. The European Union may impose the same travel ban, freeze
assets and ban exports of some items that can be used as weapons or
tools of repression. But it is equally important to watch Mugabe at
home and denounce him if he misbehaves.</TE>
<TE>   Although the opposition MDC is at an obvious disadvantage because
of repression, harassment and restrictive laws, it has decided not to
boycott the election. Therefore, it is the outside world's moral
obligation to give Zimbabwe's people a fair chance to freely express
their will at the polls.</TE>

<LD>Abruptly it is dawning on investors: The sort of scandal that
crippled Enron is not limited to that energy giant. Their diminished
faith in the reliability, accuracy and truthfulness of corporate
accounting could well hamstring the stock market too.</LD>
<LD>   In refraining from reducing interest rates again, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan last week gave the economy a modest vote of
confidence. The latest gross domestic product report estimated that
the economy grew at 0.2% last quarter. The current recession may turn
out to be one of the mildest in history. So far, so good. Now,
investors need to be reassured that capitalism works--that they
aren't at the mercy of dishonest corporate executives and accounting
firms that have rigged the system.</LD>
<LD>   The government is on the case. The Federal Reserve and the
Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the accounting
methods that PNC Financial Services Group used to get bad corporate
loans off its balance sheets. The accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young has
admitted that it was both advisor and accountant in dealing with
these loans. Then there is the bankrupt Global Crossing, which used
the same auditor as Enron: Andersen.</LD>
<TE>   The Global Crossing saga seems eerily similar to Enron's. Roy
Olofson, a former vice president of finance, warned in August about
deceptive accounting techniques. Like Enron, Global Crossing also
stopped its employees from selling company stock in 401(k) plans in
December and January. And, like Enron, Global Crossing was a fat-cat
donor to both Democrats and Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   The revenues of a number of other telecom firms may be shaky as
well. Qwest Communications and other start-ups relied on a practice
called "indefeasible rights of use," or IRU, that led to some
imaginative bookkeeping. Companies bought an IRU--essentially a share
of Internet bandwidth--marked it up as a capital expense for coming
years, then turned around and sold it, claiming it as money made. The
expense is left out of the equation, so it looks like pure profit.
This may not be illegal, but it surely is deceptive.</TE>
<TE>   To reassure an anxious public, Congress and the SEC need to crack
down harder still. Harvey Pitt, the SEC's chairman, has indignantly
rejected suggestions that, as a former lawyer for the accounting
industry, he won't pull it into line. But Pitt has remained mum about
the industry's biggest problem: the tens of millions in extra fees
that auditors can earn as consultants for the very companies they are
supposed to be policing.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) are
proposing legislation that drastically curtails the nonauditing
functions that auditors can carry out. Fast reform is direly needed.
Until it takes place, rumors about the financial health of companies,
not facts, will drive the stock market. That's not something America
can afford.</TE>

<HD>Our Off-Balance Drug War</HD>

<LD>Last week police busted Noelle Bush, the 24-year-old daughter of
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, for allegedly forging a prescription for the
anti-anxiety drug Xanax. The offense is a felony punishable by up to
five years in prison. Gov. Bush, realizing that punishment alone
would be of little help, paid $1,000 to bail out his daughter and
probably will send her back to one of the treatment centers she
reportedly has been in before.</LD>
<LD>   That's good. And what's good for a famous parent's daughter should
be good for America. In fact, the nation's $20-billion-a-year war
against drugs might stand a chance if the governor's brother,
President Bush, would urge Congress to correct the imbalance in
anti-drug funding, which directs only four cents of every dollar to
prevention and treatment. The remaining 96 cents go to what former
Health Secretary Joseph A. Califano Jr., now a drug abuse expert at
Columbia University, calls "shoveling up the wreckage of substance
abuse and addiction in hospitals, welfare agencies, foster care
programs and prisons."</LD>
<TE>   President Bush--whose daughters Jenna and Barbara both have been
charged with underage drinking and who himself was arrested in 1976
for driving while intoxicated--has impressed Califano and other drug
policy experts. Bush recognizes, as he put it in one Rose Garden
speech, that "the most effective way to reduce the supply of drugs in
America is to reduce the demand for drugs in America."</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, though, the president's newly appointed drug czar, John P.
Walters, has historically favored punishment over treatment. Last
year, he called the notion that drug sentences are too long one of
"the great urban myths of our time." Fact is, heroin and cocaine are
cheaper than ever, the annual number of heroin overdoses has doubled
since the early 1990s and the percentage of teenagers admitting to
having been drunk at some time is rising. The United States may be
winning battles abroad, but it's losing the domestic war on drug
abuse and the backward thinking of key strategists such as Walters is
one reason why.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Congress need to correct the imbalances that result in so
little federal money for treatment. Legislators should also reverse
an outrageous law passed in 1998 that bars federal drug czars from
spending even a penny on ads that mention the most commonly abused
drug of all, alcohol. Specifically, Bush should press lawmakers to
pass HR 1509, by Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) and two
Republicans, that would add underage drinking to the federal
anti-drug campaign. In 1999, Rep. Anne M. Northup (R-Ky.)--who
received $121,418 from the alcohol industry from 1996 to 2000--led a
successful congressional effort to defeat a similar Roybal-Allard
bill. Even as alcohol was killing 6.5 times more young Americans than
all illicit drugs combined.</TE>
<TE>   Adults today send a strange mix of messages to kids, permitting
seductive TV advertising, for instance, that promotes the virtues of
mood-altering prescription drugs like Xanax, Ritalin and Prozac,
while funding school-based seminars in which police officers tell
students to "just say no to drugs." And if impressionable youths end
up turning to the wrong drugs, we lock them up. This must be
confusing for young Americans--Noelle, Jenna and Barbara included.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To celebrate Mariah Carey's latest comeback, the National Football
League will stage a Super Bowl today right after she sings the
national anthem. And why not celebrate? A few months ago Carey was
hired by EMI, the recording company, and paid $21 million merely for
signing a contract. A few days ago she was fired by the same company
and was paid even more--$28 million--merely to walk away. Please, can
we be fired just like her?</LD>
<LD>   The reason for paying the high-strung 31-year-old singer to not
sing is that her beautifully crystalline voice, which has sold more
albums than anyone but Elvis and the Beatles, is no longer selling
well. Last fall her movie "Glitter" fared worse than poorly at the
box office, while its soundtrack attracted only 501,000 buyers,
1/286th as many listeners as last year's Super Bowl had viewers.</LD>
<TE>   But before we start feeling too smug as silent spectators at
America's Fame Game--building up bright young stars to tear them down
and create another lovable underdog--let's remember that lavishly
rewarding lack of success is a hallowed American tradition. We pay
farmers millions not to farm. We aid the enemies we wallop in war
more than the friends who stand beside us. When executives lead their
huge corporations into poor sales, hopeless disarray and even
bankruptcy, they're paid large sums to walk away. Why shouldn't an
album failure pay as handsomely as bankruptcy in, say, the energy
trading business? Sure, these transients in the spotlight are as
disposable as a November People magazine. They rise. They fall. Some
come back, like Cher, a Super Bowl-performing alum; others don't,
like what-was-his-name Michael Belton?</TE>
<TE>   So maybe there is something to this new Doing Less for More Mariah
Maxim, a lucrative lesson for those of us misguided souls raised to
think that only a full day's work was worth a full day's pay.</TE>
<TE>   If down is now up and vice versa in this topsy-turvy world, maybe
the underdog New England Patriots do have a chance today against the
St. Louis Rams. Our advice: Take the points and Mariah's voice.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What advice do you have for an elderly person who has no
one to handle her affairs should she become incapacitated? Is this a
service that a bank would be willing to provide?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Indeed, many banks are willing to take on this role for a
fee. If you don't have a friend or relative you would trust to fill
this role, hiring a professional custodian might be an option for
you.</LD>
<LD>   But you might consider other possibilities first. Ed Long, a
Torrance attorney who runs a Web site for seniors, suggests you work
with your minister or other religious leader to develop a group that
can discuss these issues and agree to look out for one another. Some
churches and temples already have these older-adult ministries in
place.</LD>
<TE>   You also could consider hiring a private geriatric-care manager to
help you. These specialists can help you find care and manage your
finances. You can find a manager through the National Assn. of
Professional Geriatric Care Managers at www.caremanager.org or by
calling (520) 881-8008.</TE>
<TE>   Long's organization, HELP (Healthcare and Elder Law Programs),
offers a free handy guide, "Your Way," that can help you pick
health-care agents and talk with them about your wishes. The guide is
available at the group's Web site, www.help4srs.org.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just elderly people who should plan for incapacity, by
the way. Just about every adult should have a document, known as
durable power of attorney, that authorizes a trusted person to make
decisions in case he or she can't. (Most people will want two such
documents, one for health-care decisions and another for financial
matters.)</TE>
<TE>   If you don't do this planning, a court might have to appoint a
conservator for you, and that's a fate just about everyone should try
to avoid. Much better to designate someone in advance, while you
still have time to make your wishes known.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Parents Aren't an Investment to Protect</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am 42, single, with an annual income of approximately
$65,000. I send $300 to $500 a month to my parents, whose only other
income is Social Security. Three years ago, I attempted to get my six
siblings involved in helping to support them, but so far it has not
worked.</TE>
<TE>   To protect my investment, my father has noted in his will that all
my contributions will be paid back before the estate is divided. The
only asset my parents have is their house, worth about $140,000 with
$80,000 left on the mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a better way to handle this? Should I buy the house, or
have them add me to the deed? I want to minimize any squabbling that
could happen after my folks pass away.</TE>
<TE>   A: Let's back up a minute here.</TE>
<TE>   Your parents are not an investment. Stocks are an investment. Real
estate is an investment. A good education is an investment. Your
parents, those folks who clothed, fed and educated you, are not.</TE>
<TE>   You also might want to cut your siblings some slack. There may be
some deadbeats among them, but others probably have children and
other expenses that limit their ability to help. You may be the only
one contributing to your parents' support precisely because you're in
the best position to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the situation, you might not be able to avoid
squabbling with your siblings after your parents' deaths,
particularly if you end up with the bulk of the estate.</TE>
<TE>   If you're determined to get paid back, you could spend a few
hundred bucks to hire an estate planning attorney to go over your
options, or you could read "Plan Your Estate," the Nolo Press book by
Denis Clifford and Cora Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone's estate planning situation is different, so it's hard to
give advice without knowing more details about the financial
situations of everyone involved.</TE>
<TE>   You may find that buying the house or being added to the deed is a
good idea or it could be a lousy one, because you might lose some or
all of a valuable break that otherwise would make the home's
appreciation tax-free.</TE>
<TE>   Relying on your father's will to compensate you is risky because
he could, after all, change his mind, and so could your mother if he
dies before her.</TE>
<TE>   But remember, this is not an estate worth millions. Although the
value of their home could grow between now and their deaths, right
now you're talking about an estate worth $60,000, which is to be
split seven ways.</TE>
<TE>   How much more of your energy do you really want to invest just to
make sure you get a few bucks more and your brothers and sisters a
few bucks less?</TE>

<LD>Re "Palesinian Bomber Stood Out From the Rest," Jan. 31: Your article
affectionately describes this particular day's suicide bomber with
"doe-brown eyes and softly curled hair," as one who acted out of
"desperation" and, according to her proud, grieving relatives, a
noble sense of patriotism. How desensitized are we readers expected
to become to these continuing satanic acts, this one committed by a
woman? Those Palestinian bombs have never discriminated as to the
gender or age of the slaughtered and maimed civilian Israeli victims,
and are really exploded from the blindest form of hatred.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, The Times generously dishes up the pathos, without
bothering to remind us that Israel has never once targeted
Palestinian civilians.</LD>

woman who blew herself up and injured more than 100 Israelis, killing
one elderly man. My tears were not for the terrorist you glorified in
your human-interest story or for her mother, whom you displayed in an
enlarged photo on Page A5. My tears were for the "hundred" Israeli
citizens--innocent youngsters, parents and elderly--designated only
as "people" by your report.</TE>
<TE>   Why don't you interview some of the maimed children and teenagers
who will bear the scars of terrorism throughout their lives?
Interview the families who live every day with the trauma of
terrorist bomber attacks while they go about their daily lives. Print
a photograph of the young Israeli girl who lost her limbs and most of
her family in a drive-by shooting on the West Bank. In short, glorify
the victims, not the perpetrators, who don't deserve to have their
images on the front page.</TE>

about time we did something serious about terrorism.</TE>

<LD>During the 1991 Gulf War, President Bush Sr. famously said, "What we
say goes." This hubris is echoed by Edward Bernard Glick ("So What If
They Hate the U.S.?" Commentary, Jan. 31). In congratulatory remarks
about the attractiveness of America to immigrants he ignores a basic
and near-universal fact: the sharp, polar distinction between other
peoples' views of America as a land and a people and their reaction
to the foreign policies of the American government.</LD>
<LD>   My wife and I have done a good bit of unescorted travel in Muslim
countries. We have, without exception, been warmly received in some
putatively villainous lands (e.g., Iran, Syria) by people who, when
they trusted us enough, were not hesitant to declare that while they
admired the American people they despised American government
policies.</LD>
<LD>   Glick's chutzpah regarding our right to our self-appointed role as
world leader would be less embarrassing if we were not so off the
wall about it. It is salutary to remind ourselves that Al Qaeda,
Osama bin Laden and, to some extent, even Saddam Hussein are our
creatures. Perhaps we could use a little help in formulating our
policies.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) wants to blame the Bush
administration for not putting out the fire, i.e., the "energy
crisis," but isn't interested in who's responsible for starting it
("Bush Opened Door to Enron, but Not to a State in Crisis,"
Commentary, Jan. 30). She knows full well that the culprit is Gov.
Gray Davis. You don't have to pay for what you don't buy, and Davis
could have stopped the energy crisis in a nanosecond simply by
allowing the retail cost of electricity to be priced at market.
Instead he let the providers, Edison and PG&amp;E, bankrupt themselves
and then spent the state's surplus because he didn't have the courage
to do the obvious right thing.</LD>
<LD>   What is particularly galling and sad is that doing the right thing
would have been almost painless for consumers--we would have quickly
turned off the computer and lights not in use--and the exorbitant
prices paid for marginal use would have vanished. When our country
faced a crisis, President Bush stepped up to the plate; when
California faced its crisis, Davis retreated to his rhetorical bunker
and started looking for someone else to blame.</LD>
<LD>   Feinstein will have to try another tack. This dog won't hunt.</LD>

<TE>   Feinstein's commentary speaks for itself. Enron, a hideously
corrupt and bankrupt behemoth (whose full story will probably never
be known, thanks to paper shredding), had full access to the Bush
White House and its policymaking machinery. I, through my popularly
elected representatives, did not. Well, I have formed a new
corporation of my own. It is called "My Vote." I have total access to
this new company. The Bush administration will have none.</TE>

<TE>   I was disappointed in Feinstein's commentary. Although I believe
that Bush should have given a hearing to the senator, it is important
that every Californian recognize that the energy problem has been
mostly self-inflicted. It was bipartisan to boot.</TE>

<TE>   I was surprised that Feinstein was upset that Bush would meet with
officials from Enron and other energy companies while not even
responding to her inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't she get it? Representatives of millions of dollars in
contributions are much more important to Dubya than a senator who
represents millions from a state that didn't vote for our "selected"
president. By this time I would have thought that our senator would
know the definition of a "compassionate conservative" Republican: The
president is compassionate to all the companies that gave him money
and conservative in his approach to government intervention to help
the common man.</TE>

<LD>Re ''School Board OKs Cuts of $56 Million,'' Jan. 25: More budget
cuts? My children's school has seven fund-raisers, and we started to
ask for direct donations (because parents are tired of having to do
fund-raisers year after year) to cover what's cut this school year,
so we can continue to have a good public school in the LAUSD. We can
manage all this because we have a strong PTA that does whatever it
takes so we can minimize the effect of budget cuts.</LD>
<LD>   What about those schools that are already having problems--low
performance, socially disadvantaged students and no PTA support? The
government keeps saying it wants our children to excel in their
education, but the government keeps taking away the resources. I'm
confused. I thought we were supposed to get more money for our
children's education.</LD>
<LD>   How about the lottery money--what happened to that? And I heard
the BB money is gone too. These are not rhetorical questions; I would
like someone to explain these things to me.</LD>

<HD>India's Missile Test and Tension With Pakistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "India's Wayward Trajectory," editorial, Jan. 30: It is misleading
to describe India's missile test as ominous and "blustery," as it was
conducted in a totally nonprovocative manner across international
waters fully in accordance with the international practice, with
prior intimation to Pakistan and others, including the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The test was part of the technological evolution of India's
indigenous integrated missile development program, and the timing was
determined solely by technical factors and has no bearing whatsoever
on the situation on the border. Like that of the U.S., India's
missile program is solely for the purpose of defending the nation in
a security scenario in a region that is marked by clandestine
transfer of nuclear and missile technologies.</LD>
<LD>   The editorial rightly pointed out that for decades Pakistan has
been sponsoring terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir. The
so-called ban on Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, two
Pakistan-based organizations behind the Dec. 13 attack on the Indian
Parliament, came too late. Both these organizations have reportedly
changed their names. Further, even this cosmetic action was not taken
by President Pervez Musharraf because of his choice or commitment to
fighting terrorism but under direct pressure from the U.S.
government, as was his earlier decision to snap Pakistan's intimate
ties with the Taliban.</LD>
<TE>   H.H.S. Viswanathan</TE>
<TE>   Consul General of India</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial illustrates the point that nations can fall victim
to their own rhetoric and propaganda. In the wake of the legitimate
U.S. response to the criminal acts of Sept. 11, other nations,
leading among them India, are making a serious mistake in mixing
genuine political and freedom struggles with terrorism. Musharraf has
shown through his pragmatic leadership how civilized nations should
behave when faced with historical challenges. Call a spade a spade;
i.e., when it is terrorism call it terrorism--the attack on the
Indian Parliament, for example. But don't cloud the real issue of
Kashmir's struggle for self-determination by lumping it with
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   It is now the Indian leadership's challenge as to how it responds
to Pakistan's action and focuses on de-escalating the war hysteria
and resolving the Kashmir issue.</TE>

<HD>Private Horses Reined In at Will Rogers State Park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is with profound dismay that I read of the decision of the
director of the California state parks to temporarily remove private
horses from Will Rogers State Historic Park and the fact that this
eviction may become permanent ("Will Rogers Didn't Leave His Park to
Horses," Commentary, Jan. 27). As a former volunteer park aide,
assisting with the park ranger mounted patrol unit, my experiences
would counter Rusty Areias' opinion that private horses don't belong
in a public park.</LD>
<LD>   As opposed to the times when the barn has stood empty, with
visitors walking in briefly to glimpse a mothballed facility, the
horses brought life and excitement to the park. Most visitors were
thrilled to be able to visit a working barn, to see these beautiful
animals in the historic setting in which Will Rogers kept them. For
an increasingly urbanized Westside, and especially for schoolchildren
who have never seen an animal more exotic than a dog, this is a
wonderful experience.</LD>
<LD>   I never took a ride without experiencing a positive interaction
with a park visitor, and I rode almost daily for five years. Allowing
horses to be trailered in will not be the same; with redevelopment
pushing horses out of all the neighboring canyons, it will be the
exception rather than the rule for a rider to decide to use these
historic bridle trails.</LD>
<TE>   Do the horses cause some damage? Yes. But patches of mud in a
paddock or wear on a stall door can be repaired. The loss of a
resident horse population would mean the loss of much of what makes
Will Rogers State Historic Park romantic and unique.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The easy part of the war that the Bush administration is prosecuting
against terror is almost over. The next chapter in this unfolding
campaign promises to be far more equivocal.</LD>
<LD>   Take Syria. While the president didn't mention it as an imminent
target, Syria did make the U.S. list of states supporting terror.
Currently, Syria is estimated to be making upwards of half a billion
dollars annually importing oil from Iraq in violation of resolutions
adopted by the United Nations Security Council, to which Syria was
recently elected as a nonpermanent member.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as last summer, U.S. relations with Syria seemed, if
not warm, at least progressing. In August, David Satterfield, a
former U.S. ambassador in Beirut who is now deputy assistant
secretary for Near East affairs, described his talks with Syrian
foreign minister Farouk Shareh as "excellent." Satterfield promised
"maximum" U.S. effort to "stop the terrible suffering" in Israel and
the Palestinian territories and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the
principle of "land for peace" on the Syria-Israel front.</LD>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, however, no one is describing relations between
the Bush administration and Damascus in such glowing terms. In
October, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage suggested that
Damascus would be included on Washington's short list of military
targets if it did not accede to U.S. demands. But there has also been
quiet, practical and unprecedented cooperation between Syrian and
U.S. intelligence agencies. This odd blend of antagonism and
cooperation has relevance far beyond the axis between Damascus and
Washington: It offers insight into the difficulties of meshing the
U.S. campaign to defeat "terror with a global reach" with the
internal politics of countries like Syria, where this policy carries
both dangers and rewards.</TE>
<TE>   In the days and weeks following the Al Qaeda attacks on U.S.
targets, the dangerous implications of U.S. policy for the regime of
Syrian President Bashar Assad were readily apparent. Syria was
willing to condemn Osama bin Laden. But it coupled that willingness
with an insistence that a distinction be made between terrorist acts
and struggles for national liberation. It has continued to host many
Palestinian rejectionist groups, and its refusal to disavow Lebanon's
Hezbollah was evidence of the deep divide that, in U.S. eyes,
threatens to define relations between the two countries. Armitage
warned that U.S. policy toward Syria "will be according to what the
coalition [against terror] will find proper, ranging from isolation,
to economic investigation, even to military actions."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter President Bush himself declared that Washington
was evaluating Syrian promises to assist in the global effort lead by
Washington. "We take [the Syrian declarations] seriously," he said,
"and intend to give them a chance to prove [them]."</TE>
<TE>   In the months since October, a wary equilibrium has been
established between the U.S. and Syria. The Assad regime has
accommodated Washington's immediate objectives, which center on
destroying Al Qaeda's international operations and keeping the
confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah on ice. But Washington has
yet to translate its broader objectives into new and more emphatic
policy demands for an end to Syrian support for groups like Hamas and
Islamic Jihad, nor has it placed these concerns in the context of
specific inducements for or threats to countries like Syria that
comply with or defy Washington's directives.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as the West does not insist on Syria punishing Hamas,
Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad, the Syrians will help" the U.S. in its
pursuit of Bin Laden, one frequent visitor to Syria notes. In fact,
he says, Damascus is working closely with U.S., British and Canadian
intelligence agencies. "The FBI and CIA are there long-term."</TE>
<TE>   Syria has reason to support this effort, says a State Department
official. "The Al Qaeda people, after all, are related to the people
at Hama," he said, a reference to the Syrian government's bloody
assault in 1982 on the town of Hama, a stronghold of anti-regime
Islamic fundamentalists, in which an estimated 10,000 to 25,000
people were killed, most of them civilians. "They don't need our
encouragement."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, eager to trumpet Syria's membership in the fight against
terror, Bashar Assad has taken to championing his father's assault on
Hama to the many American visitors who have recently toured the
Syrian capital. In Syrian eyes, Washington's assault on Afghanistan
places their destruction of the city of Hama in a new, more
internationally acceptable light. "He is very proud of it," observed
one recent visitor.</TE>
<TE>   Syria assumes it has nothing to fear from the Bush White House,
believing that once Al Qaeda is defeated, Washington will return to
business as usual. But while Bush's State of the Union did not
mention Syria specifically, it did make clear his determination to
target not just states that actively promote terrorism, but also
those that are "timid in the face of terror" and offer support and
refuge to terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Syria offers a "target rich" mark for such an effort. It is
enjoying an explosion in unmonitored, sanctions-busting trade with
Iraq, fueled by an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil
per day. The country offers refuge and support to numerous
Palestinian rejectionist and Islamist groups. Syria may have
prevailed upon Hezbollah to maintain relative quiet on Israel's
northern border, but it shows no interest in conforming to
Washington's long-standing requests to force the organization to
abandon the military dimension of its activities, which Syria sees as
a liberation struggle. Nor does it evidence any interest in making
life difficult for the Palestinians conducting business in Damascus.</TE>
<TE>   On these issues, acknowledges a U.S. State Department official,
"we might as well be talking to a wall. We are always looking for
levers to make our requests more effective. There are constant
[internal] debates on what penalties should be exacted."</TE>
<TE>   Short of "sending in the Blackhawks," as one official put it--an
option that, so far, has not made it to Bush's priority list--the
U.S. has yet to discover a set of instruments that will compel the
Assad regime to act according to an American script. In Washington,
the fight against terror may seem self-evident. But in Damascus, as
elsewhere, cooperation with the U.S. agenda--against Palestinians or
Lebanese Islamists or Iraqi President Saddam Hussein--carries a
price: an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Recent
suggestions that Assad might be interested in negotiating with Israel
to make a deal are consistent with this view.</TE>
<TE>   As the Syria example makes clear, when Washington sets its sights
beyond Bin Laden, it will be crucial to factor the Arab-Israeli
dimension of contemporary politics in the Middle East into its policy
equation.</TE>

centuries later, Johnson would find ample evidence to confirm his
claim. But over the last decade or so, U.S. political leaders have
carved out an even more ignominious retreat: family misfortune.</LD>
<LD>   With whiffs of Enron wafting through the White House, President
Bush resorted to the gambit last week. Having been caught
misrepresenting his relationship with former Enron chairman and CEO
Kenneth L. Lay, Bush tried a new tack, expressing shock and
indignation at the company's callous--and possibly
criminal--irresponsibility. Adopting the posture of aggrieved family
member, he announced that the victims of Enron's perfidy included his
own mother-in-law.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike thousands of other Enron employees and investors, Bush's
mother-in-law, who saw an $8,000 investment go up in smoke, will not
lose her home or retirement income. But however hollow it rings, the
president's melodramatic gesture commands our attention, for it
offers a limpid illustration of an increasingly popular recourse
among U.S. leaders. Put in the form of an adage: When the going gets
tough, the tough talk about their family pain.</LD>
<TE>   The strategy has been abundantly evident in recent days. After
hasty consultations with a former Enron public-relations official,
Linda Lay, wife of the company's former chairman, appeared in a
two-part interview on NBC's "Today" show. Sitting in her elegantly
appointed home, a tearful Lay portrayed her husband as a "decent" man
duped by underlings, a "victim" of others' deceit. Along with the
couple's five children (all from previous marriages), she insisted
that the company's collapse "has been a nightmare for the family ....
We've all suffered right along with everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Even GOP Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, one of the primary beneficiaries
of Enron's political largesse and chief sponsor of the deregulation
law that enabled the company to be more than a mundane energy
supplier, has donned the mantle of victim. In an interview with a
Dallas newspaper, Gramm announced that his wife, Wendy, a member of
the Enron board, had lost more than $600,000 in deferred compensation
when the company declared bankruptcy. The luster of victimhood, Gramm
may be betting, will distract voters from questioning the propriety
of him pushing sweetheart legislation on behalf of a company, then
turning around and accepting, through his wife, hundreds of thousands
of dollars from that company.</TE>
<TE>   For those who savor irony, it is delicious to watch Republican
leaders playing this victim-by-proxy game, after years of hearing
them devalue the suffering of others with talk of responsibility and
rugged individualism. But the game is thoroughly bipartisan. Former
President Bill Clinton raised it to high art, routinely exploiting
family trauma--his father's death, an abusive, alcoholic stepfather,
even, in the pivotal days before the 1992 New Hampshire primary, his
own marital infidelities--for political gain.</TE>
<TE>   Former Vice President Al Gore routinely indulged in the same
practice, hoping, in the words of one political consultant, to
"humanize" his image. But Gore, for better or worse, lacked Clinton's
confessional gifts, and his forays into family trauma--wife's
depression, son's accident--invariably came across as inept and
insincere.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most unseemly examples of the practice came during the
1996 campaign. Not content merely to criticize Republicans'
dependence on the tobacco lobby, Gore recounted watching his sister,
a smoker, die a slow and agonizing death from lung cancer. That
searing experience, he reported, had confirmed his conviction about
the fundamental evil of the tobacco industry and, by implication, of
the politicians beholden to it. The problem, as with so many of
Gore's autobiographical stylings, lay not in the broad outlines of
the story but in the details, specifically, the fact that he had
continued to accept tobacco money for more than a decade after his
sister's death.</TE>
<TE>   While Gore plumbed the depths, the prize for cynicism surely
belongs to the current president's father. In a televised debate
against Michael S. Dukakis during the 1988 presidential contest, the
elder Bush was asked to explain his sudden shift from longtime
supporter of abortion rights to righteous opponent of abortion. The
correct answer, of course, was Ronald Reagan, who insisted that Bush
change his stance as a condition for including him on the Republican
ticket in 1980. Rather than admit the obvious, candidate Bush,
clearly primed for the question, rehearsed a heart-wrenching story of
his and Barbara's loss of a 3-year-old daughter. Diagnosed with
leukemia and told she had only four weeks to live, she landed up
surviving for six months. Watching that child's struggle, Bush
explained, had persuaded him of the utter sanctity of every human
life and, by implication, of the inherent evil of abortion. So, yes,
he concluded, his position had "evolved ... evolved towards life."</TE>
<TE>   Like his son, the elder Bush lacked Clinton's relish for
self-revelation, but it was a poignant and plausible story, at least
plausible enough to paralyze Dukakis. (Kitty and I lost a child, too,
you know, he replied woodenly.) No one at the debate thought to ask
why Bush had waited more than a quarter-century after his epiphany
before reversing his stance on abortion. Either the elder Bush is,
like Gore, a slow learner or his recounting of the family tragedy was
what it appeared to be: political opportunism designed to deflect
attention from an inconsistency. By contrast, the younger Bush's
melodramatic account of the misled mother-in-law appears almost
charmingly innocuous.</TE>
<TE>   No one would deny the anguish of losing a child, or even the
outrage of seeing loved ones bilked out of their money. Even
president's feel pain. But there is a difference between pain and
pandering, between acknowledging the grief and disappointments
intrinsic to family life and parading them for political gain. Viewed
in this context, President Bush's declaration of victimhood bespeaks
a plague in our political life.</TE>

<HD>Unfinished Business</HD>
<DH>Civil rights groups are neglecting a profound crisis in
their midst.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY CROUCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Perhaps the greatest social tragedy of our moment is that the
civil-rights establishment, symbolized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, is
consistently removed from the greatest problems weighing upon the
communities it purportedly represents.</LD>
<LD>   We are accustomed to seeing Jackson attach himself to
controversies, specious and real. Jackson, along with the Rev. Al
Sharpton, jumped into the middle of an academic squabble at Harvard
set off when university President Lawrence H. Summers questioned
black-studies Professor Cornel West's commitment to traditional
academic pursuits. West, who is a scholar in the university's W.E.B.
du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research, hardly needs Jackson's
help. On the other hand, Jackson and the civil-rights establishment
rightfully decried the murder of James Byrd Jr., who was dragged to
death in Texas by white racists in a pickup truck.</LD>
<LD>   What we are not accustomed to seeing, however, is either Jackson
or any prominent civil rights organizations taking on problems facing
Afro Americans that are far greater than threats of racist murder or
police homicide. Though we surely have a sturdy black middle class
and the role of the black in America is far too complex to be
restricted to issues of skin color, it is also true that the
Afro-American community suffers from an unprecedented crisis of
violence, decadence, will and confusion.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, recent books on racist lynchings--James Allen's "Without
Sanctuary" and Philip Dray's "At the Hands of Persons Unknown," for
example--are profoundly harrowing and should not be swept aside. But
were anyone to write a study of how many black people have been
killed at the hands of the young monsters who began rising to street
power in the early 1970s, we would discover that there has never been
slaughter on this level. Between 1994 and 1999, 45,000 black men and
women were murdered in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Do we ever hear the civil-rights establishment address this?
Hardly. What we hear about is "warehousing" young black men in the
penal system, the racist nature of our courts, "stigmatizing black
youth" or "the stereotyping our young" by mass media. This suggests
that the only lost black lives important to our professional
protesters are those taken at the hands of white cops or white
racists. Had 2% of those 45,000 mentioned earlier--1,125 people--been
killed by white racists in just six years, the civil-rights
establishment would have marched away its feet, its calves and would
now be hopping along on its knees, waving placards, singing and
giving speech upon speech upon speech about how government had to
stop "this genocide of our young black people."</TE>
<TE>   There is also a crisis of ethnic identity that infects not only
the black lower class but too many of the black middle-class young as
well. Both groups have been convinced that being "authentic" does not
allow for high-quality intellectual engagement in school, something
that John H. McWhorter addresses in his book "Losing the Race," but
is a subject that has been written about and discussed for more than
a decade.</TE>
<TE>   In a debate over affirmative action at the University of Texas Law
School in the 1990s, Lino A. Graglia, a professor at the school and
an opponent of preferential admissions policies, said the question
was not one of the innate inferiority of black students, but that the
problem was cultural and no one ever wanted to address that.</TE>
<TE>   He was right. A few years ago, the Washington Post carried a story
about black middle-class kids in a wealthy Midwestern suburb. While
constituting more than half of the students in public schools that
spent more than $10,000 per pupil, they comprised only 10% of the top
students and 90% of those who performed most poorly. This is a
complete reversal of a long, long Afro-American recognition of the
absolute importance of education to personal growth and social
advancement. The unconscious absorption of anti-intellectual
defensiveness and minstrel ideas of authenticity can be understood by
reading Robert C. Toll's "Blacking Up." Fox Butterfield's equally
profound "All God's Children" argues that traditional attitudes among
Scot-Irish in the South that sanctioned extreme violence in response
to trivial insults began infecting Southern black men in the 1890s
and are the root of the black violence we see nationwide today.</TE>
<TE>   But as the problem applies to the black lower class, the so-called
"inner city" black, we should now face up to something else that
ought to be clear in hindsight. The central concerns of the U.S.
civil rights movement were equal protection under the law, fair
employment practices, open housing and voting rights. No one
understood that high-quality pubic schools were a necessity if black
people were to capitalize on these revolutionary policy changes. Had
such schools been an issue around which people organized and
seriously battled from the late 1960s until now, public education
might not be the awful mess it presently is. It should be a central
civil-rights issue right now.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the cultural question, an issue that Jackson himself
understood well years ago. During the 1980s, he raised questions
about black popular music that hypnotized kids with its beat and
urged them to "get up off your ass and smoke some grass." He warned
that such material was potentially dangerous and could lead to
serious problems. So, Jackson was one of the first to recognize what
lay ahead and what has now created a growing controversy as more and
more black people, some of them former hip-hoppers, understand that
there is a strong connection between the worst of rap and the
anti-social attitudes that have eroded the quality of lower-class
black life. The celebration of thugs and freelance prostitutes, the
touting of violence and murder, the crude materialism and the
defining of being "real" as essentially ignorant, hedonistic,
anti-social and obnoxious--all have done so much harm that, as one
black record executive told me, "The handful of black millionaires
created by rap doesn't make up for all of the people who have been
killed, beaten and terrorized by all of those kids who take this
garbage too seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Had those images of black youth been created and propagated by
white record executives, the civil-rights establishment would have
run rap out of the world 20 years ago for "stereotyping our black
young people and promoting negative values." Only now and then has
anyone said anything about it--but never for long. There are rumors
that rap moguls have learned that sprinkling some bucks among these
organizations provides a free pass to continue profiting from the new
minstrelsy. As for those who say that white kids are the biggest rap
fans and are equally influenced by the gangster-rap ethos, let's
compare body counts. No one wants to do that. We would then see who
takes it seriously and who doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   When running for president in 1988, Jackson told his followers,
"We have lost more lives to Northern dope than we ever lost to
Southern rope." He also said that, were he elected to the Oval
Office, he could not legislate against irresponsible sexual behavior,
poor performance in school, laziness and those uncommitted to their
communities. Echoing the famous speech Shakespeare gave to Henry V,
he laid down a challenge to blacks down in the dungeon of poverty and
dissolution: "The first step in changing our condition is to change
our minds.... By your mind, you are transformed. Nothing is more
powerful in the world than a made-up mind."</TE>
<TE>   What the civil rights establishment needs to do is make up its own
mind and free itself of any conventions that reduce its effectiveness
at identifying and addressing the problems of its constituency. This
is particularly hard at this time, because courage is quite
important, something that has too often waned since the death of
Martin Luther King Jr. Leadership must lead, must take chances, must
be willing to take hits for "airing dirty laundry," for "attacking
black people," for "alienating our youth," for "helping white people
believe we're inferior." None of those things should be feared,
because taking stands against the anti-intellectual posture that
Spike Lee now describes as "suicidal," or standing up for young
people and for all others who are terrorized by the criminals among
them, or calling to the carpet popular culture that serves only to
inspire decadence and irresponsibility, would do much not only for
one ethnic group but also for the country as a whole. To maintain the
conventions might not convince anyone that black people are doing
just fine except for all this white racism out here, but it could
surely maintain the proof that the civil rights establishment is not
up to providing the kind of heroic leadership our nation needs from
it right now.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. audiences seemed receptive to President Bush's State of the
Union address last Tuesday. But in much of the rest of the world, his
words were viewed as highly provocative. Below are excerpts from
commentary that appeared in the foreign press. (Compiled by Gale
Holland)</LD>
<LD>   ENGLAND</LD>
<LD>   In George Bush's America, there's evidently little room for a
sense of noblesse oblige ....Though the campaign against Al Qaeda has
been brilliantly destructive of appalling evil forces, it has far to
go. Bush's own account of the nightmares he's trying to pre-empt
makes that very clear. How can he hope to do it solely through the
might of American power and intelligence?</LD>
<TE>   --By Hugo Young in The Guardian</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's State of the Union address, the most powerful
speech he has delivered to America, should rightly be seen as an
essay in fundamentalism. It laid out the principles which he hopes
will eventually transform American culture and protect its
society.... But in Bush's mistaken choice of Iran as a target, his
silence about Israel and his missionary call to propagate American
values, he risks leaving the United States standing very much alone
on the world stage ....</TE>
<TE>   For a start, the idea of an "axis of evil" between three countries
which are barely speaking is nonsense.... While Bush made a vague
reference in his speech to working closely "with our coalition," he
is entirely wrong if he thinks there is a coalition for attacking
Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Nor, probably, is there for action against North Korea, or even
Iraq. His speech was striking for its lack of mention of the United
Nations, or of [British Prime Minister] Tony Blair. That supports
other signs of a marked cooling off in the transatlantic relationship
since November. America's allies will also be perturbed by the lack
of any mention of Israel. The message is that America will go it
alone if it must.</TE>
<TE>   --By Bronwen Maddor for the Times of London</TE>
<TE>   IRAN</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that although the U.S. forces have been trying for the
past few months to capture Saudi-born dissident Osama bin Laden, who
is considered by Washington to be the mastermind behind the Sept. 11
incidents, they have so far failed to achieve this objective. Thus,
to hide this failure, Bush needs to raise a commotion over what he
claims are threats from independent countries like Iran or North
Korea in order to divert U.S. public attention from the Bin Laden
issue ....The new Republican administration has not taken any
effective steps toward solving certain domestic problems facing the
American people, like the deepening economic recession. Rather, it
has been allocating a great portion of public funds for military
purposes. Now, to counter rising public objections and justify its
militaristic policies, the U.S. president has to draw the attention
of the American public to some imaginary foreign threats ....Bush is
unlikely to succeed in covering up his failures on both the domestic
and international fronts by resorting to such cheap and demagogic
tactics.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial in The Tehran Times</TE>
<TE>   CANADA</TE>
<TE>   The most worrisome thing about a U.S. foreign policy steered by
the perception that the world is divided between allies who support
the war on terrorism (Russia, Pakistan and Israel, for instance) and
those who don't is where it leads. Through the Bush lens, the bad
guys have to be told to shape up or look out. But what if there are
more bad guys than realized, and what if they don't shape up? Should
they all be bombed into submission, as part of some global campaign
that lasts indefinitely? Or will a diplomatic approach somehow have
to be revived?</TE>
<TE>   It will not be Bush but his successors who will likely have to
answer that.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial in The Globe and Mail</TE>
<TE>   TURKEY</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is pursuing a policy completely at odds with Turkey's
strategic interests regarding intervention in Iran and Northern Iraq
....In fact, the U.S. and Britain would like to divide Iraq and form
a puppet government in Northern Iraq. The puppet government is ready
with all its institutions, save a proclamation.... Turkey, Syria and
Iran are opposed to the division of Iraq, as are Russia and China.
Turkey's interests are not in line with those of the West but with
those of its regional neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   --By Erol Manisali in Cumhuriyet</TE>
<TE>   JORDAN</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons Bush's hawks are determined to strike soon is
that Iraq is rapidly emerging from the political isolation imposed on
the country by the U.S. since the 1991 Gulf War. The visits of Deputy
Premier Tarik Aziz to Moscow and Beijing at the end of January
consecrated Iraq's reinstatement as a member of the community of
nations and should make it all the more difficult for the Bush
administration to resume assaults on Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   --By Michael Jansen in the Jordan Times</TE>
<TE>   ISRAEL</TE>
<TE>   Some of those who for years dismissed the possibility of America
taking effective action against rogue regimes will oppose the
extended Bush Doctrine as dangerous, imperialist, impossible, or all
of the above. But it is not Bush who is being over-ambitious.... On
the contrary; it is our pre-Sept. 11 world that was characterized by
reckless complacency as the threats to the West grew and grew. Bush
is being bold, bolder than the world ... expected, but not bolder
than necessary.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial in the Jerusalem Post</TE>
<TE>   SAUDI ARABIA</TE>
<TE>   What Bush [said] on Tuesday night was that he was going to make
America safe from further attacks.... regardless of the cost. And he
was still going to cut [Americans'] taxes. So much good news must
have made Americans sleep better in their beds Tuesday night. But
what about the rest of the world?</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians who listened to the address must be still
wondering what the president meant when he said, "America will lead
by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and
unchanging for all people everywhere; no nation owns these
aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them."</TE>
<TE>   They will have enough time to work out the relevance of these
words to them while facing Israeli tanks, bulldozers, closures and
American harangues about "Arafat not doing enough."</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial in Arab News</TE>
<TE>   PAKISTAN</TE>
<TE>   A greater anomaly in Bush's speech is his unwillingness to
differentiate between terrorists and freedom fighters.... While
terrorists are evil men whose targets are innocent people, freedom
fighters resist those robbing them of freedom. Theirs is a noble
struggle which is invariably crowned with success. In the case of
Palestine and Kashmir, the boot is on the other foot, for it is
Israel and India which have been guilty of state terrorism.
Regrettably, the Bush speech contains no censure of these two
violators of human rights. Instead, it targets Iran, Iraq and North
Korea, none of which is in possession of someone else's territory.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial in Dawn</TE>
<TE>   IRELAND</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. attack on [Iran, Iraq or North Korea] would gravely affect
the international coalition to fight terrorism. Without clear
evidence, an express mandate from the United Nations and the
concurrence of its allies, any attack would be a foolhardy and
dangerous exercise in unilateralism. Bush should not assume the
successful military operation in Afghanistan legitimizes such an
escalation.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial in Irish Times</TE>
<TE>   AUSTRALIA</TE>
<TE>   The conservative political commentator Robert Novak, writing in
the Washington Post, observed that [Bush's] dramatic turn
"effectively removed the Enron scandal from the headlines." It also
sent Mr. Bush's administration scrambling. It has emerged that it had
no broader policy in place to support the new rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   --By Peter Hartcher in the Australian Financial Review</TE>
<TE>   NORTH KOREA</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-resident Korean journalist Kim Min Ung charged that
Washington's hostile policy toward North Korea stems from its
ambition to gain global supremacy by force. Commenting on the Bush
administration's declaration of this year as a year of war, he stated
that U.S. strategy is essentially geared to supporting its superpower
hegemony by military strength. Referring to the U.S. policy toward
North Korea as hostile and aimed at stifling the latter, he said:
"The U.S. pressurizes North Korea to give in to its policy of
hegemony, and this is the way it wants the latter to change. That
kind of change is not in the least bit desirable in the eyes of our
nation as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned story in Pyongyang Times</TE>
<TE>   INDONESIA</TE>
<TE>   Overall, it was indeed a strong speech, but in our judgment it was
also an incomplete one. The rest of the world, especially the
developing non-Western countries, have a great interest in seeing
that America should be successful in achieving a respectable level of
economic growth towards the end of this year. Only a strong America
can help the poorer parts of the world achieve a decent level of
living.... We do expect a strong and structured commitment from
Washington in overcoming the five major problems of the developing
countries. Namely, availability of potable water; production and
distribution of electricity affordable to all; construction of
affordable housing; the eradication of major public diseases such as
tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS; and widespread public education with
an emphasis on mastering the basics of digital technology. To a large
degree, the improvement of the social-economic level of poor people
throughout the world is also an effective way of eliminating
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial in the Jakarta Post</TE>
<TE>   INDIA</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's State of the Union message is a declaration of
war on terrorism and he has backed it up with the largest increase in
defense spending in two decades. Against whom is this war? The speech
indicates explicitly who the enemy is and then obfuscates it with a
lot of strategic deception rhetoric.... Bush speaks of a non-existent
axis of Iraq, Iran and North Korea when he is referring to another
state which has armed itself with North Korean missiles and has
programs of weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   When President Bush talks of thousands of terrorists now outside
Afghanistan, he can only mean Pakistan.... There is only one war
against terrorism. The Bush speech makes it clear that Pakistan
cannot pretend to be with the international alliance against
terrorism and permit thousands of Al Qaeda and Taliban cadres to slip
into Pakistan ....Unfortunately, Pakistan has deluded itself that it
can succeed with its duplicity, as it has over the past 50 years. Now
Gen. [Pervez] Musharraf and his corps commanders face a stark choice.</TE>

<HD>The Root of Secession's Stall: Identity</HD>

<LD>The San Fernando Valley secession movement is stalled. What once
seemed all but inevitable now appears increasingly unlikely. There
are many reasons, most of them unrelated to the virtue of the cause.
For example, the state's energy crisis during the past year
highlighted the importance of the Valley's link to the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power. Sept. 11 and its aftermath made the
very idea of breaking away seem "unpatriotic."</LD>
<LD>   But the biggest obstacle to the success of the secession movement
is the Valley's own political and social culture. Simply put, the
Valley has a serious identity problem. On the one hand, as author
Kevin Roderick has put it, the Valley looms as a kind of national
archetype--"America's suburb," the ultimate expression of the
greatest demographic shift in the late-20th century. At the same
time, he notes, the Valley also appears to many as L.A.'s "oversized
appendage," a shapeless glob of places. Virtually all the Valley,
with the exception of Burbank, Glendale, Calabasas, San Fernando and
some smaller pockets, has been part of Los Angeles since 1915, when
the area had less than 4,000 residents. Valleywide civic roots have
not had an opportunity to grow.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, although the L.A. portion of the Valley is now large
enough to be America's sixth-largest city, its cultural and political
life remains almost completely subordinate to powerful forces over
the hill, ranging from Westside sophistos to downtown political
operatives. Lacking a coherent notion of what the Valley is or is
becoming, secessionists have largely stated their case in negative
terms: breaking away would end the indifference and abuse, real and
imagined, coming from "over the hill."</TE>
<TE>   "The way you are going to get [secession] going is to come up with
a vision," says Studio City attorney David Fleming, who heads the San
Fernando Valley Economic Alliance. "We need a vision, and if we don't
get it in the next few months, we are in real trouble."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the determined and increasingly aggressive opponents
of secession draw on L.A.'s powerful political, economic and cultural
traditions. This identity transcends normal political boundaries: The
business establishment and left-labor groups are united in their
opposition to Valley secession. The most important sector of this
opposition is what may be called the "high church,"-- institutions
and people who purport to speak for the people of Los Angeles.
Worshippers in this church include business advocates of "civic
grandeur," men like entrepreneur Eli Broad and former Mayor Richard
Riordan, whose notion of a Greater L.A. requires that the Valley
remain subordinate.</TE>
<TE>   The high-church vision of L.A. embraces such ideas as Staples
Center, Walt Disney Hall and the L.A. County Museum of Art. To rival
regions, notably New York City, high-church leaders, along with
studio executives, constitute what's left of L.A.'s big-business
establishment, in what has become a decidedly small-business town.
The high church even has its own spiritual leader, Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony, whose new home, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, is
rising downtown. Mahony has said that Valley secession would be
tantamount to abandonment of L.A.'s poor, a view that Riordan also
supports. Similar sentiments emanate from the universities and most
media, which have traditionally been at odds with the cardinal or
Riordan on other issues. Typical is the assertion in one recent
foundation-backed paper, co-authored by a member of UCLA's School of
Architecture and Urban Planning, that caricatured secession as a
"class-based, strongly racialized movement of social separation."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more important, secession would threaten the political
class that benefits most directly from L.A.'s dysfunctional
governmental structure. Although largely elected by Valley voters,
Mayor James K. Hahn now appears likely to lead a powerful coalition
of labor, liberals and bureaucrats in the campaign against secession,
which will likely run on two tracks. The Hahn-led city bureaucracy
has already stated that it will challenge the new city's taxing
authority, as well as its ownership of city services from electricity
to parks. Meanwhile, the municipal establishment, media, unions and
academic elites will mimic Mahony and play the racist card in the
hope of driving a wedge between the largely Anglo-led secessionists
and the growing minority voting blocs in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Arrayed against these forces, the "low church" secessionists are
hopelessly outgunned. Although some medium-sized Valley businesses
support separation, few major corporations based in the Valley are
likely to rally to the secessionist cause. Furthermore, the
"appendage" legacy has left the Valley without a civic institution to
carry its flag, since virtually all dominant regional institutions
are L.A.-centric. The Valley simply lacks the religious, social and
community infrastructure enjoyed by small cities, a disadvantage
embarrassingly evident on the political level.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past decade, the Valley has not produced one single
citywide leader of note. Former Los Angeles City Councilman Joel
Wachs once appeared to have that potential, but his poor showing in
last year's mayoral primary underscored the limits of his appeal.
Furthermore, much of the Valley, as a result of redistricting games,
is represented by politicians from outside the Valley. A proposed new
Valley Latino seat wouldn't likely produce a secessionist, since that
would impede the quest of Latino elites to take over citywide power.
Finally, the secessionists themselves, with the exception of Fleming
and car dealer Bert Boeckmann, are a largely undistinguished crowd.
Secession's chief spokesman, Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain,
unmasked recently as a Glendale resident, is regarded by heftier,
less visible secessionists as woefully undersized for the
high-profile job of rallying a powerful civic movement.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, over the long term, the "over the hill" gang's days as Valley
dominator will end. For one thing, the Valley, in real terms, is
structurally stronger than the rest of the city. It is gaining
population, both in its heavily Latino northeast and predominately
Anglo west, even as the rest of the city is stagnating. During the
1990s, the Valley's population grew by 10.7%, more than 40% faster
than the rest of the county. Politically, Valley voters now
constitute almost half the city total.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's views notwithstanding, the Valley has a thriving, if
highly dispersed, ethnic economy, as befits a region whose population
is now roughly half Latino and Asian. An economy of smaller
enterprises, it generally outperformed the city on the other side of
the hill in the 1990s, making the transition to the digital age in
better shape than the rest of L.A., whose dependency on larger
enterprises has retarded growth. Finally, although its Valleywide
institutions--save for those focused on economic development--are
comparatively weak, the region's neighborhoods remain remarkably
strong. Valley dwellers, particularly homeowners, are fiercely loyal
to their residential pockets. Although lacking in grandiosity, their
politics are less about ethnic and political symbolism than improving
governmental services.</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of Alex Padilla, the City Council president, and of
home-grown politicians like California Assembly Speaker Robert M.
Hertzberg and Andrei Cherny, who's running for Hertzberg's district
seat, augurs a new leadership class capable of articulating a new
Valley vision. The notion of a decentralized, neighborhood-dominated
city government, focused on the concerns of the middle class, could
prove the Valley's enduring political contribution to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Once such a vision develops, the Valley might be able to transcend
its legacy as an exploited province and become the city's beating
heart.</TE>

<HD>Greenest Games Ever? Not!</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It will cost nearly $2 billion to stage the Salt Lake City
Olympics--almost $800,000 per athlete--with U.S. taxpayers picking up
about a quarter of the tab. Partly due to increased security, the
Utah Games, which start on Feb. 8 and continue for 17 days, will be
the most expensive Winter Olympics ever. "These are not wasted
funds," says International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques
Rogge. Such an investment, he says, leaves a "great legacy" to
Olympic cities.</LD>
<LD>   But in Salt Lake City, the Games will leave another legacy as
well: profound ecological consequences. Following the 1994 Winter
Games in Lillehammer, Norway, the IOC adopted an ambitious set of
guidelines emphasizing environmental protection, sustainable
development, and a "proactive" and "dynamic approach" to achieve
green goals. The environment was touted as one of three pillars of
the Olympics, along with sports and culture, and cities bidding for
the Games had to trot out their green credentials.</LD>
<LD>   But such considerations have since been largely abandoned in Salt
Lake City, and in the end, the region will likely be left with
significant environmental damage from the Games. "The only thing
green about these Games," says Alexis Kelner, co-founder of the Utah
environmental group Save Our Canyons, "is the color of the currency
being thrown around."</LD>
<TE>   That money is going everywhere except to environmental protection.
In the beginning, some $6 million was budgeted by the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee (SLOC) to address environmental concerns. In
February 1999, that sum was reduced to $1.5 million, or just
one-tenth of 1% of the 2002 Olympic budget.</TE>
<TE>   With meager resources at her disposal, Diane Conrad Gleason,
director of environmental programs for the SLOC, has focused on
educational projects, including a children's video with television's
"Bill Nye, the Science Guy." Seminars on green themes have encouraged
Salt Lake hotel and restaurant managers to implement water and energy
conservation techniques. Gleason also has promoted an international
tree-planting campaign. And she's continued to mouth the requisite
incantations about hosting "the greenest Games ever."</TE>
<TE>   But educational initiatives and public relations cannot mitigate
the negative impact of major construction projects like the ski jumps
at Utah Winter Sports Park, which have left a large, ugly gash on the
mountainside. Even Mitt Romney, president and CEO of the SLOC,
concedes that was a mistake. "It happened before I came on board," he
said. Nor could it prevent billionaire oilman Earl Holding, at the
time a member of the SLOC, from pulling off what many activists see
as the biggest environmental scandal of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Using his considerable political connections, Holding arranged a
land swap with the U.S. Forest Service to acquire 1,377 acres at the
base of his Snowbasin ski resort, with carte blanche approval from
Congress to develop the land. Congress also pitched in a $15-million
subsidy for an access road to Holding's resort.</TE>
<TE>   Pristine mountain wilderness soon morphed into condos, restaurants
and ski runs. Parking lots encroached on riverbed areas, degrading
trout habitat and discharging waste runoff into the watershed. As
approved by Congress, these developments were exempt from the usual
public review required by the National Environmental Policy Act. The
waiver was justified, according to Republican Utah Sen. Orrin G.
Hatch, to facilitate the staging of the Winter Olympics. But critics
contend that the public was hoodwinked. "No land swap or other
similar venture was necessary to stage the Games," says Howard
Peterson, a member of the U.S. Olympic Organizing Committee's
site-selection team that evaluated Snowbasin as a venue for ski-race
competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to make the best of a bad situation, the Environmental
Advisory Committee (EAC), a volunteer group established by the SLOC,
worked with environmental groups and government officials to choose a
road pathway to Snowbasin that would have the least impact on
wetlands, streams, and hawk and owl habitats. The EAC also lobbied to
protect vulnerable canyons in the Wasatch Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   But the EAC wielded no real authority, and several members,
including Ivan Weber, head of Utah's Sierra Club chapter, quit the
group after concluding that ecological concerns were a low priority
for the Olympics committee. "When environmentalists would bring up an
issue," Weber explained, "SLOC would say, 'It's too early to do
anything,' and then at some point later would say, 'It would have
been nice, but it's too late now."</TE>
<TE>   The Snowbasin parking lots strike another environmental nerve as
well. When Salt Lake was vying to host the Winter Games, bid
officials promised that attendees at the 2002 Olympics would be able
to ride public transportation to events. But the SLOC later reneged
on this pledge and adopted a transportation plan that relies heavily
on private automobiles. Thirty-five million dollars were allocated to
build new parking lots and expand old ones in order to accommodate a
huge influx of traffic. The SLOC acquired a borrowed fleet of 4,000
gas-guzzling SUVs, which are exempt from U.S. clean air standards,
and vans to ferry athletes and others between event venues and the
Olympic Village, a 60-square-mile area. Chemical salts that pollute
the watershed will be used to clear the snow and keep the roads open
24 hours a day. And air quality will suffer because of all the
vehicular exhaust, which creates a sickly, yellow haze during winter
temperature inversions in Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   But the SLOC's chief environmental officer sees a silver lining in
the smog: emissions credits. Various companies in Utah and other
states pollute less than they are allowed, Gleason says, and some
have donated their unused pollution credits to the Olympics. These
donations, she says, will offset any emissions increases related to
the 2002 Games, resulting in "the first Olympics with net-zero
emissions."</TE>
<TE>   Many critics scoff at the notion of trading emissions, as nothing
can change the fact that more emissions will be discharged into the
air because of the Olympics than otherwise would have been. "It's a
lot of smoke and mirrors and bad arithmetic," says a Utah state
environmental official.</TE>
<TE>   Recycling is also cited by Olympic officials as an environmental
triumph for the Games. Strong objections from the GrassRoots
Recycling Network and other national green organizations prompted
Olympic organizers to improve plans to achieve "zero waste" through
recycling and composting. Coca-Cola Co., a leading Olympic sponsor,
contributed extra funds for an advanced, two-bin recycling system
that could conceivably eliminate 90% of the waste generated by the
Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   But critics consider this insufficient. "The Olympics should not
only avoid being environmentally destructive, it should also be a
showcase for sustainable development," says Peter Berg, director of
the San Francisco-based Planet Drum Foundation and co-founder of
Guard Fox Watch, an international project that monitors ecological
issues related to the Olympic Games. Two years ago, Berg and Japanese
ecologist Kimiharo To met with Salt Lake Olympic officials and urged
them to feature an array of green alternatives, including
state-of-the-art solar panels, compost toilets and dual-use plumbing
systems for recycling "gray water" in athlete's quarters. "It would
have set a precedent," Berg noted. "It would have been a model for
future Olympics and other outdoor sports spectacles."</TE>
<TE>   But no money was available to demonstrate these new technologies.
"What a shame," says Ivan Weber of the Sierra Club. "A crucial
opportunity to raise awareness was squandered." Part of the problem,
according to Weber, stems from the itinerant ethos of Olympic
professionals "who travel like a circus crew, staging event after
event with little or no concern for community or local environment."</TE>
<TE>   When the 2002 Games are over, Olympic officials will leave behind
a skeletal staff, while others move on to the next show. And the true
cost of hosting the Salt Lake Olympics won't be clear until much
later.</TE>

<LD>Irv Rubin, 56, the national director of the Jewish Defense League,
today sits in solitary confinement at the federal Metropolitan
Detention Center in Los Angeles. He is being held without bail on
charges of plotting last fall to bomb a mosque in Culver City, the
Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles and the Orange County
field office of U.S. Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), whose origins
are Lebanese.</LD>
<LD>   Rubin casts himself as the protector of American Jews, but to date
not a Jewish leader, political activist, rabbi or organization has
stepped forward to offer him support. Even such far-right Jewish
groups as Americans for a Safe Israel have remained silent--and they
are not ordinarily reluctant to speak out. In 1994, AFSI's West Coast
head proclaimed Dr. Baruch Goldstein a hero and a Jewish martyr for
having gunned down 29 Arabs at prayer in a West Bank mosque before
being killed himself by an angry crowd.</LD>
<LD>   The silence comes as no surprise. Ever since Rabbi Meir Kahane
founded the group in New York in 1968, the JDL has operated on the
fringe of Jewish life. With its rallying cry of "no more victimhood
for Jews," the group initially attracted a small number of followers,
largely among young working-class Jews, some of whom were students at
the city colleges in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Borrowing heavily from the black militants of the 1960s, the JDL
proclaimed it would protect Jews from attack. But there was a
problem: While anti-Semitism still existed in America, by 1968
physical safety was generally not at issue for mainstream Jews,
particularly in New York City. To the extent that he was able to
attract mainstream followers, Kahane relied on his secondary issue:
the freeing of Soviet Jews, a legitimate agenda that many Jewish
organizations in the United States had written off because it seemed
like a lost cause. Kahane and his followers were not shy about
demonstrating, heckling, shouting abuse and throwing eggs at Soviet
officials. Given the Cold-War political climate, there were few
complaints from either Jews or non-Jews.</TE>
<TE>   But history has a tendency to outflank political movements. Soon,
the JDL students were at law school or taking graduate degrees in
sociology; or they had married and become entrepreneurs, moving into
middle-class suburban enclaves that had formerly been closed to Jews.
By the time Soviet Jews were free to travel, Rubin had become the
head of the JDL, and victimhood for Jewish Americans seemed a thing
of the past. There was a small remnant of supporters left, mainly
among the older generation, and most of them preferred to stay in the
background. They were Jews who held fast to vivid memories of boyhood
rejection and photographs of Jewish dead in German concentration
camps, guarding themselves vigilantly against a Gentile world they
would always distrust.</TE>
<TE>   It was at this time--perhaps 15 years ago--that I first met Rubin.
I was the editor of a new weekly, The Jewish Journal of Los Angeles,
and Rubin was upset that we were not accepting JDL ads. He asked for
a meeting; I agreed.</TE>
<TE>   We met, to my surprise, in a conference room belonging to an
upscale law firm in Century City. It smacked of money and social
status. There was nothing working class here. There were about eight
JDL members in the room, all men. No one introduced himself as the
firm's law partner or associate, but the whole setup attested to the
fact that the group still had its silent supporters.</TE>
<TE>   I explained that my newspaper would not publish anything we deemed
racist or that incited the public to violence. The ads seemed to me
to step over the line; as I recall, they demonized Arabs. That was
against our policy. If the JDL changed its language, we would
consider publishing their ads. There was some back and forth, some of
it angry--charges of censorship, a cry for a free press--but I kept
my tone friendly, and we parted on relatively amicable terms.
Eventually, they modified some of their ads, and we consented to
accept their money and print them.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, shortly after the first intifada began in Israel,
and Yitzhak Rabin, then Israel's defense minister, had issued his
famous order that soldiers would break the bones of the Palestinian
teenage rock throwers, I heard that the JDL had called a meeting in
Malibu. It was partly a fund-raiser, partly a cry for Jews to acquire
weapons and learn the rudiments of self-defense. The host, I was
told, was a wealthy Jewish activist who insisted upon anonymity.
Everything about it was hush-hush. Invitation only. No names or dates
supplied. No press allowed. I was informed later that a large crowd
had showed up, many of them well-to-do Los Angeles Jews, but no one
would acknowledge having attended. No one wanted it known that he had
made a donation to the JDL.</TE>
<TE>   It never has been clear where the JDL acquires its funds.
According to a story by Nita Lelyveld in a recent issue of The Times,
Rubin "does his fighting on a shoestring." People donate cars, which
are then sold; checks from his wife's mother help pay the grocery
bills. There are neither JDL nor family funds to cover his legal
fees. The fringe organization has become even more marginal and has
achieved an outsider status.</TE>
<TE>   The JDL might have fared better in the 1920s and 1930s. Jews were
true outsiders in America then, rejected, unhappy, longing to be
embraced--or at least accepted--by white, Gentile America. The JDL's
more combative approach might have appealed to those most angry at
the American establishment.</TE>
<TE>   But the JDL, an organization of self-identified outsiders, issued
its call to arms at precisely the moment Jews were becoming insiders.
Despite their numbers (under 3% nationally) Jews are today at the
center of American life and have a significant hand in shaping its
culture.</TE>
<TE>   Given this reality, the JDL, in style and message, ("For every Jew
a .22"), sounds as though it belongs in a different America.
Relatively few American Jews today have been denied education, jobs
or housing--much less physically attacked--because of their Jewish
identity. Though many still fear anti-Semitism and are sensitive to
its presence and its outrages, there is recognition among Jews that
the JDL today represents a step back in time--and in social status.
And few Jews desire that for themselves or for their children.</TE>

<HD>Mexico's Labyrinth of Bizarre New Tax Laws</HD>
<DH>The Mexican tax system has always been complex. Now it's
absurd.</DH>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>A few days ago, I tried to do something that used to be quite
simple--I requested a restaurant receipt so I could deduct a business
lunch on my Mexican income-tax return. A bureaucratic nightmare then
began.</LD>
<LD>   I was asked by the restaurant to provide a copy of my Mexican
Federal Income Registration. I offered the one I always carry in my
wallet but was told I would need a photocopy, as the restaurant would
need to keep a copy. I was also asked to provide a signed letter
swearing that I would indeed deduct the business lunch from my
taxes--or be subject to an unspecified penalty.</LD>
<LD>   If I met these requirements, the restaurant manager assured me, I
would not only get my receipt; I would also be exempt from a new
"luxury" tax that the federal government is assessing on meals in
restaurants.</LD>
<TE>   It's not that the old ways were much better. The Mexican tax
system has always been complex and unfair. It allowed millionaires to
pay little or no tax while the middle class paid excessively. Despite
the high taxes, the government provides completely inadequate public
services.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, it has been clear that Mexico needed to overhaul its
tax system if it wanted to become a more competitive and fairer
country. Proposals for fiscal reform have been floating around for
years, always to be derailed by powerful special interests.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, President Vicente Fox, a few months after becoming
the first Mexican president ever to take power peacefully coming from
an opposition party, submitted a proposal to Congress which would
have applied a 15% value-added tax (IVA) on all products, including
foods and medicines, which are presently exempt. Congress, which
still has a PRI majority, rejected this proposal and, instead,
enacted a wide array of special and "luxury" taxes that, rather than
improving the system, have set it back.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules for deducting business lunches are a consequence of
a new 5% luxury tax, on top of a 15% IVA, on restaurant meals--unless
the meal is a business expense, in which case the luxury tax does not
apply. Other new taxes are equally strange and unwieldy. A luxury tax
is applied to cellular phone service, top-of-the-line computers,
boots and an assortment of other products. A special 10% tax is also
being levied on soda sweetened with products other than sugar. New
prohibitively high taxes have been applied to alcoholic beverages--a
bottle of tequila, as a consequence, now costs more in Mexico than in
the U.S. A new 3% wage tax is being levied on low salaries paid by
employers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the new taxes are ostensibly unfair. The so-called luxury
taxes are collected from average customers, but not from business
ones. The tax on cellular phones not only punishes one of the few
industries that has been growing and creating jobs during the present
recession, but disregards the fact that, in Mexico, cellular
telephones are not a luxury--there are 19 million wireless users in
Mexico, as opposed to 13 million fixed-line customers, because many
Mexican communities are simply not wired for telephones. The tax on
computers is expected to deepen the digital divide between Mexico and
the developed world, thus making Mexico less competitive. The tax on
low wages discourages private firms from hiring people most in need
of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The new taxes are also protectionist. The tax on soda has not been
designed to raise revenue but rather to compel producers to switch
from U.S.-made maize-based fructose sweetener to more expensive
Mexican cane sugar. The tax, moreover, is pushing prices up for a
product that millions of Mexicans drink because there is no safe
drinking water available in many areas of the country.</TE>
<TE>   The new taxes further complicate a system already known for its
complexity. Red tape for businesses and the government will increase
substantially. Restaurants, for example, will have to keep and relay
to the government millions of federal income-tax registration copies
and letters from patrons wanting to deduct their business lunches,
and the government will have to process them. The new taxes are so
unworkable that already, in the few weeks since they were enacted,
the rules of application have twice had to be changed.</TE>
<TE>   Special treatment for certain groups is maintained. Farmers and
truck owners continue to get special privileges. Bureaucrats and high
public officials are exempt from paying taxes on certain parts of
their income.</TE>
<TE>   The new taxes are also likely to prove ineffective for the purpose
of collecting more government income. In the case of alcoholic
beverages, for example, they will raise more revenue per unit sold,
but sales have already dropped off, suggesting that in the end,
distributors will pay less income tax rather than more. The
inevitable layoffs of workers will also mean a reduction in tax
revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Although President Fox is not really responsible for the mess--the
fiscal reforms he proposed in March of 2001 were much simpler and
fairer--his administration is paying part of the political bill. Last
month, Fox's personal approval rating dropped below 50% for the first
time since he became president in December 2000. Mexicans, unused to
a divided government, can't believe that Congress would act on an
issue as important as taxes without the prodding of the president.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has not ruled out the possibility of trying again to enact a
true fiscal reform. He can't do it now, because his party, the
National Action Party (PAN), is in a minority position in Congress.
But Fox's political strategists believe that the PAN could become the
majority party in the 2003 legislative elections.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's economy will not collapse because of the new tax rules.
The country still looks like a good bet for investors, especially
when compared with such Latin American countries as Argentina or
Venezuela. But Mexico has the potential to grow at a fast pace--maybe
5% or 6% a year for a decade of two. To do that, to follow the path
of Chile instead of that of Argentina, the country must get rid of
the many structural obstacles that have limited investment for
generations. Overhauling the tax system to get a simpler and more
investment-friendly fiscal environment is a crucial step.</TE>
<TE>   So, what did Mexico's legislators do instead? They made the
country's tax system even more complex and unfair--and in the process
blew a momentous opportunity for positive change.</TE>

<HD>Help Your Refrigerator Coils Keep Their Cool</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY ABRAMS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When dust, dirt and pet hair accumulate on the cooling coils of a
refrigerator, the appliance is forced to work overtime to maintain
the proper temperature inside. This results in higher operating costs
and increases the risk of a compressor failure (more than $1,000 to
repair on some models).</LD>
<LD>   Keeping the coils clean is one of the easier do-it-yourself items
in your home. Most experts recommend checking the coils and cleaning
them as needed twice yearly (double that if you have pets).</LD>
<LD>   On free-standing refrigerators the coils are usually located under
the doors, at the bottom, behind a removable metal or plastic grill.
Most "built-in" refrigerators, such as Sub Zero and G.E. Monogram
series, have coils positioned behind a grill above the doors. These
grills are typically removed by pulling them forward and unhooking a
retaining spring.</LD>
<TE>   Regardless of where the grill is located, make a mental note about
how it attaches to make it easier to replace it later.</TE>
<TE>   Use a flashlight to inspect the compartment behind the grill. The
coils look like a series of metallic fins spaced closely together. If
they have not been cleaned for a while, a thick layer of dust and
debris will probably be coating every surface behind the grill.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to clean the cooling coils is with a vacuum cleaner.
Use an open-ended hose or a crevice attachment. Simply push the hose
over all the dirty areas behind the grill and toward the rear
components. Check with a flashlight for any missed areas. If clean,
reattach the grill.</TE>
<TE>   If you see no grill at the top or bottom of the unit, you probably
have a vertically mounted coil system at the back of the
refrigerator. If so, you will have to pull it away from the wall to
get access to it. Again, use a vacuum cleaner to remove dust.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever you clean the coils, take a minute to examine the door
gaskets for cracks or gaps. The door gasket creates a tight seal
between the door and the front of the door frame to keep in the cold.
Any gaps will allow warm air into the box and cause condensation to
form inside. Naturally, the unit will have to work harder to
compensate. Contact a qualified appliance repair technician to
replace the gaskets if they appear worn.</TE>
<TE>   Window air conditioners are also prone to inefficient operation
and compressor failure from dirt and dust.</TE>
<TE>   Some window units have a front grill that snaps into place, and
some require a screwdriver for removal. Look carefully at how yours
is attached. If unsure, contact the manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   Once the grill is off, the coils are readily accessible right in
front and can be easily cleaned with a vacuum cleaner hose
attachment.</TE>
<TE>   Some units have a foam-type filter behind the front plastic grill
that can be cleaned with soap and water. Let it dry before carefully
reinstalling it. Replace the grill as it came out.</TE>

<HD>Enforcement Delayed on Shut-Off Valve Measure</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enforcement of an ordinance passed by the Los Angeles City Council at
the end of last year requiring the installation of gas shut-off
valves before the close of escrow has been put on hold, said a
spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. An
amendment, aimed at clarifying language in the measure, is pending
before the City Council. The council is expected to act on it
shortly.</LD>
<LD>   While the ordinance is under review, home buyers still have one
year after the purchase of their houses to install the seismic
shut-off valves.</LD>
<LD>   Under a directive from the California Public Utilities Commission,
the valves no longer will be installed by the Gas Co. but by private
contractors, whose work will be inspected by the Department of
Building and Safety. Homeowners can obtain a list of qualified
contractors from that agency. A permit, which costs $43.40, is
required to install the device.</LD>

<LD>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has adopted a new safety
standard intended to help prevent children from becoming entrapped
and injured in automatic security gates.</LD>
<LD>   The stricter safety standard requires that automatic gate systems
have at least two mechanisms to prevent entrapment, a standard
similar to those for automatic garage doors.</LD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I am 83 and having trouble understanding what is going on
where I live and how I ended up in this situation.</LD>
<LD>   When I bought my townhouse 25 years ago in Culver City, my monthly
dues were affordable at $60 a month. There are 35 units here, and $60
from everyone took care of everything.</LD>
<LD>   I thought once I paid my mortgage off 18 years ago that I would be
fine to live here until I die, as I have no kin.</LD>
<TE>   I never dreamed of the kinds of problems that plague me today
while I struggle to keep my house and survive. I live off Social
Security and interest from my savings of $65,000. Today my dues are
$200 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Most people my age have moved away, and a younger generation has
moved in. Right away they raised the dues. Then they hired management
companies. They kept losing lots of money but didn't seem to mind or
explain how the management companies lost our money or why they keep
raising the dues. These young owners seem not to have a care in the
world, and money seems to be no object.</TE>
<TE>   Yesterday I got a paper in my mailbox that said in big letters,
"Notice, your TV was too loud. Pay $50." Last week I got a notice
that said, "Your trash can was out past noon after garbage pickup
day. This is unsightly and decreases the property value for all the
other homeowners. Pay $75."</TE>
<TE>   I never heard of fines until this young generation took over the
whole complex. This last notice I got said the board is assessing
everybody $3,000 for "improvements." What does this mean, and what
will happen to me? I can't afford to pay this kind of money. What can
I do?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Buyers in common interest developments are rarely told
that regular assessments charged to homeowners when they first move
in will be raised each year thereafter and almost never remain at the
same level as when the unit was purchased.</TE>
<TE>   Two types of assessments are specified in the California Civil
Code, "regular" and "special." Regular assessments involve day-to-day
operations. Special assessments, according to the law, are necessary
to "repair, replace or restore any major component or to provide
adequate reserves therefor."</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, regular monthly assessments can be raised up to 20%
per year by the board without approval by owners. This means regular
homeowners association assessments can more than double in five years
without a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the special assessment is for an emergency, a majority vote
of the owners is necessary before the assessment is approved.</TE>
<TE>   However, if the total of special assessments in any fiscal year is
less than 5% of the gross budgeted expenses for that year, no
homeowner vote is required before they can be assessed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the promise of participation in homeowner association
affairs as the result of "membership," assessments can be raised
without homeowner approval and must be paid. This predictable raise
in regular assessments must be factored into any decision to purchase
in a common interest development.</TE>
<TE>   Owners who fail to pay either type of assessment risk having their
property foreclosed on by the homeowners association to pay those
assessments.</TE>
<TE>   Fines levied by a board for any reason are not assessments, and
they cannot be the basis for foreclosure by the board. These
penalties can become liens against the individual owner's property
but may not form the basis for a sale of the owner's property to
satisfy those liens.</TE>
<TE>   Requirements set forth in Civil Code Section 1363 regarding
creation and assessment of monetary penalties must be followed.</TE>
<TE>   Before any fines can be assessed, board members must give you
notice of their intent, inform you of the meeting date to consider
the fine and, if you request, hold a hearing. Other notice provisions
are required after the meeting. Each requirement must be followed, or
the "fine" is invalid and you may pursue damages.</TE>
<TE>   As there are numerous charges and fees that can be imposed against
an owner in addition to assessments, homeowners are urged to consult
with an attorney who specializes in this type of law before their
purchase, or at any time such fees become an issue. Ignoring such
items could cost the homeowner his or her property.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's top housing official has pledged to make 2002 a year of
pro-consumer federal reforms to tackle one of residential real
estate's most vexing problems: widespread abuse and consumer
confusion about the fees charged at mortgage closings.</LD>
<LD>   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Mel Martinez is expected
to unveil new national loan-fee disclosure forms shortly that would
change the rules for most home-loan transactions in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   But in advance of those reforms, some mortgage banking and
brokerage firms are initiating new, voluntary consumer disclosures on
their own. They are beginning to spell out in detail the loan fees an
applicant can expect to pay, and how much other settlement costs
should total. A handful of firms are even promising applicants that
if closing fees exceed initial "good faith" estimates by a threshold
amount-- 10%, for example--the company will issue a new disclosure in
advance of settlement that would permit the borrower to get out of
the deal.</LD>
<TE>   What's particularly important about these new, voluntary
disclosures is that cost-conscious mortgage applicants across the
country can demand similar information from brokers and lenders who
are not yet offering extra disclosures.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, you don't have to wait for the new federal rules.
Once you know the key questions, you can demand answers upfront--at
or right after application--before you commit to a specific deal. Use
the lending industry's own best disclosure questions to your own
benefit, now rather than later.</TE>
<TE>   For example, one of the most helpful new disclosure formats comes
from Fidelity Home Mortgage Corp., a mortgage banker based in
Timonium, Md. The company requires all brokers to use the disclosure
form with every applicant. Key elements you can put to practical use:</TE>
<TE>   * Full disclosure of all fees to be paid by the lender to the
broker, and the reasons for the payments.</TE>
<TE>   If, for example, a lender is going to pay a broker an extra $2,200
as a "yield spread premium" for your loan, you need to know why. Is
it because you're paying a higher interest rate than the lender's
regular or "par" quote? Are you paying an extra one-quarter of a
percentage point because the broker is chipping in for some of the
regular settlement costs? What are they? Are they priced reasonably?
Whatever the rationale, you need to get an explanation--form or no
form.</TE>
<TE>   * Full disclosure of all services to be performed by the broker.</TE>
<TE>   These typically involve obtaining basic qualifying information
from the applicant, checking credit, providing advice regarding the
range of alternative loan products available, submission of the
borrower's application documents and coordination of title and other
settlement services. For this a broker normally receives an
"origination" fee.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for extra fees beyond that, according to the new
Fidelity disclosure, brokers have to spell out precisely what
additional services they intend to perform. They must also document
and retain details of these services in each customer's loan file for
possible later audit.</TE>
<TE>   * Full disclosure of the rate-and-fee alternatives available to
each borrower.</TE>
<TE>   If a borrower requires a below-market interest rate, additional
upfront payments will be necessary to "buy down" the rate. If the
borrower wants a limited-cost or no-closing-cost loan, the interest
rate will have to be higher by some amount. If the customer simply
wants a plain-vanilla, market-rate mortgage--the standard rate and
standard fees--that should also be described.</TE>
<TE>   The point is: To understand your options, you need them spelled
out in a formal way, with all expected fees in plain sight before you
commit to a binding application. Only then can you make an informed
choice.</TE>
<TE>   * Full disclosure of the contractual relationship existing between
you and the broker, and between the broker and the lender actually
funding your loan.</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage brokers originate an estimated 60% to 70% of all new home
mortgages. They are not lenders--they have no independent stashes of
cash. But many of their customers erroneously think of them as
lenders. (Brokers' corporate names sometimes feed that
misunderstanding; after all, a "mortgage company" sure sounds like a
company that lends money for mortgages.)</TE>
<TE>   Here's what Fidelity's model disclosure for its brokers says about
that in bold, capital letters: "We (the broker) are acting as an
independent service provider and not as your agent, with no duty or
loyalty or fiduciary duty to you or any lender.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not represent all lenders in the marketplace, and the
lender with which your mortgage loan is placed may not offer the
absolute lowest price, absolute best terms or the highest amount of
loan dollars available."</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough--as long as you know it in advance. So don't be shy
about questioning fees, services or contractual duties up front--with
or without a formal disclosure form.</TE>

<LD>The Storer House in Hollywood, an important Frank Lloyd
Wright-designed home, has come on the market. An example of his
pre-Columbian or early Modernist architecture, it is one of four
houses in L.A. built by the late architect using patterned concrete
blocks.</LD>
<LD>   Designed in 1922 for homeopathic physician John Storer and built
in 1923, it is owned by Joel Silver, producer of the "Lethal Weapon"
films and such other movies as "The Matrix" (1999) and "13 Ghosts"
(2001).</LD>
<LD>   Silver, who has owned the house since 1984, completed a
painstaking restoration with the help of Wright's grandson, architect
Eric Wright. Silver not only worked on the house, but also reinstated
the original landscaping and built a pool that had been planned but
never completed. He has had the house on and off the market since
1998.</LD>
<TE>   Period furnishings, described as museum-quality pieces designed by
Frank Lloyd Wright, are available at extra cost.</TE>
<TE>   About this house: The floor plan forms a T and has large public
spaces, each with a fireplace. The dining room and kitchen are on the
main floor with an adjacent maid's quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The voluminous living room is upstairs. It has connecting outdoor
terraces with city views to the east and the west. The house is on an
elevated view site near the restaurants and boutiques of Sunset
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Even at a glance, the house is distinctive as it is clad inside
and out in patterned blocks that identify it as a Frank Lloyd Wright
design. Perched above the street, the house is behind gates.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $3.5 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: Three bedrooms, a den and three bathrooms in 2,967 square
feet; 11,160-square-foot lot.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The den could be a fourth bedroom; the home also has a
spa.</TE>
<TE>   Where: Hollywood</TE>

<LD>Sarah Michelle Gellar, star of the TV series "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer," and actor Freddie Prinze Jr. have put their San Fernando
Valley houses on the market and moved into a home on the Westside.</LD>
<LD>   The couple, who will co-star in the upcoming live-action movie
adaptation of the Saturday morning cartoon classic "Scooby-Doo," were
engaged in April but have not yet announced wedding plans.
"Scooby-Doo" is due out in June.</LD>
<LD>   The house that Prinze listed, at $3.3 million, is in Toluca Lake.
It is on nearly an acre of landscaped grounds and has a tennis court,
pool and grassy yard. The gated, 4,000-square-foot hacienda,
originally built in 1947, has two master suites with his-and-her
bathrooms and closets plus a two-bedroom guest house.</LD>
<TE>   The house that Gellar listed, at just under $2.2 million, is in
Sherman Oaks and has valley views. Built in 1942, the one-story
traditional-style house, behind gates, has a pool, spa, guest
house/cabana, sports court, motor court and outdoor barbeque/kitchen.
The house has four bedrooms and seven bathrooms in slightly more than
3,600 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Gellar, 24, has starred on the TV series "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" since March 1997. She appeared in the 1997 movies "I Know
What You Did Last Summer" and "Scream 2" before starring in the 1999
movies "Simply Irresistible" and "Cruel Intentions." She also
appeared in the 1999 movie "She's All That," starring Prinze.</TE>
<TE>   Prinze, 25, met Gellar on the set of "I Know What You Did Last
Summer," in which he also appeared. He co-starred in the movies "Wing
Commander" (1999), "Boys and Girls" (2000), "Head Over Heels" (2001)
and "Summer Catch" (2001). Prinze is the son of the late
actor-comedian Freddie Prinze, who co-starred in the '70s series
"Chico and the Man."</TE>
<TE>   Both San Fernando Valley houses are listed with Monty Iceman of
Prudential California Realty, John Aaroe Division, in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   Iceman also has the listing on the Studio City home of actress
Michelle Trachtenberg, 16, and her family. She's on Gellar's series,
playing Buffy's little sister.</TE>
<TE>   That house has three bedrooms and two bathrooms plus a den with a
fireplace. Built in 1948 and recently remodeled, the
1,630-square-foot house with a large pool and a gated drive is on the
market at $539,000.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Namath, the former Alabama All-American and New York Jets
quarterback who has been said to have "elevated the Super Bowl into
the nation's consciousness in 1969" when the 17-point underdog Jets
beat the Baltimore Colts, has purchased a Brentwood condo for
$610,000.</TE>
<TE>   Namath bought a two-bedroom, 1,800-square-foot unit in a
contemporary, four-story building.</TE>
<TE>   The condo has plantation shutters, a stone fireplace, a rooftop
pool and views of the ocean, city and mountains. There is also a
well-equipped fitness room in the building, constructed in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Namath, who also has a home in Florida, bought in the L.A. area
because his children attend private school here. He is helping to
raise his daughters from a marriage that ended in divorce. His former
wife moved to Southern California in 1999 when she filed for divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Known in his youth as "Broadway Joe" for his flamboyance, Namath,
58, is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A few years ago, he
became a spokesman for a struggling pre-Internet dial-up sports
platform with stats, scores and news. The company, SportsLine.com
Inc., in which he is a board member, became a multimillion-dollar
entity and a popular sports Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Namath also works with Boehringer Ingelheim and Abbott
Laboratories, marketers of medicines for osteoarthritis, from which
he has suffered since he was 23.</TE>
<TE>   Christiana Capetillo of Coldwell Banker, Marina del Rey, had the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   David Murdock, chief executive of Castle &amp; Cook, has sold the
four-acre, Bel-Air site of the former estate of the late Henry
Salvatori for $15 million, according to real estate sources not
involved in the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock took ownership of the land slightly more than a year ago
as part of a complex exchange initiated by Gary Winnick, founder of
Global Crossing, to acquire Murdock's Bel-Air home. The real estate
and other assets traded by Winnick for Murdock's house have been
estimated to be worth from $60 million to $95 million.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, whose Global Crossing filed last week for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, had planned to build on the land but changed
plans after razing the 12,000-square-foot house, designed by
architect Paul Williams for Salvatori, who was a confidant of Ronald
Reagan's.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock, who purchased another house in the area after trading his
home to Winnick, sold the Salvatori land to a local businessman who
plans to build on the site.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Hilton and Jeff Hyland of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills,
represented Murdock in selling the land, and Hyland also represented
the buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Bill Sheinberg has purchased a Beverly Hills-area home
owned for more than 25 years by the late actress Elizabeth Montgomery
for $6.5 million, according to real estate sources not participating
in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Sheinberg, in his early 40s, formed the Bubble Factory production
company in 1995 with his brother, Jon, and father, Sid Sheinberg,
former MCA chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   The house had an interim owner who totally restored it after
buying it from actor Robert Foxworth, the late actress' husband.
Foxworth listed the house at just under $3.9 million in 1999.
Montgomery, who starred as Samantha on the sitcom "Bewitched"
(1964-'72), died at 57 in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The house was built in 1932 for Howard Hawks, who directed such
movies as "Scarface" (1932) and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1953).
The house was designed to look like a country house in England in
which Hawks had lived.</TE>
<TE>   On nearly two acres with a tennis court and a pool, the
7,000-square-foot-plus home has a library with a wet bar, a
banquet-sized dining room, a breakfast room, a butler's kitchen, a
cook's kitchen and a guest house.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Babajian and Kyle Grasso of Prudential Estate Properties,
Beverly Hills, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Concepcion, one of the founders of the Crips who went on
to start his own label--Grand Jury Records--and became a gang
mediator, has listed his Ladera Heights home at about $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Concepcion, who is in his early 40s, wants to move to a larger
home. He has owned the Ladera Heights house since it was built in
1997. The house has six bedrooms in about 4,500 square feet. It has a
marble entry, family room with media center, master suite with
sitting area, a spa tub, 20-foot-high, vaulted ceilings and a
park-like yard.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Concepcion organized an all-star contingent of West Coast
rappers called All in the Same Gang, which led to a truce between
gangs. Last year, at the Russell Simmons-organized Hip-Hop Summit in
New York in June, Concepcion led the conflict-resolution meeting with
Louis Farrakhan.</TE>
<TE>   Kerri Jones of Re/Max, Beverly Hills, has the listing.</TE>

<HD>It's Still Her Dream House</HD>
<DH>In the 37 years Phyllis Diller has lived in her Brentwood
home, she has filled it with what matters most: art, humor and
memories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phyllis Diller likes to stay put when it comes to where she lives.</LD>
<LD>   Other celebrities may move as frequently as they change wardrobes.
Not Diller. She's in her 37th year in her 10,000-square-foot
Brentwood home.</LD>
<LD>   "It was the house I always dreamed of," she said of the 1914
residence, "and here it was, already built."</LD>
<TE>   Diller bought the Country English-style house in the fall of 1965,
and she's still having sweet dreams in it.</TE>
<TE>   An energetic 84, she is still acting and already appeared this
year in the recurring role of Titus' grandmother on the Fox sitcom
"Titus."</TE>
<TE>   She's doing stand-up comedy and just finished a week-plus run on
stage at the Mohegan Sun Casino near New London, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   She's playing the piano. Classically trained in the '30s at the
Sherwood Music Conservatory in Chicago, Diller played with 100
symphony orchestras in the U.S. when she was in her 70s.</TE>
<TE>   And she's painting. That's a love she has had since 1963, when she
did an oil painting of a nightclub stage with a spotlight and titled
it "And Now ... ." The still-life hangs in the 18-foot-long hallway
entry of her home with dozens of her other acrylics, watercolors and
oils.</TE>
<TE>   "And now a comic comes and stands in front of the spotlight," she
said, jumping in front of the picture to demonstrate how it works.</TE>
<TE>   So prolific is Diller as an artist that the upstairs gallery and
many of the other walls in her house are also filled with her work,
much of it created in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Many of her earlier paintings were sold to collectors. When one
canvas sold at auction in the '80s for $5,000, she turned one of her
upstairs rooms into an art studio.</TE>
<TE>   That's where her works-in-progress can be found, including one
that she has been working on for 15 years. "I like the face on the
woman now," she said. "At one point, she had too many wrinkles."</TE>
<TE>   Diller doesn't think of the painting as a self-portrait despite
her well-publicized penchant for cosmetic surgery. "I was called the
Queen of Plastic Surgery," she has been reported as saying. "I did
bring it out of the closet." She even wrote about it in her 1981
book, "The Joys of Aging and How to Avoid Them."</TE>
<TE>   Diller never had formal art instruction. "I just do what I do,
sometimes without even testing the water," she said. "I don't let
fear or criticism stop me."</TE>
<TE>   It's a philosophy she started practicing after reading the book
"The Magic of Believing" by Claude Bristol. It prompted her to become
a comic when she was nearly 40 and a mother of five.</TE>
<TE>   Since her stand-up debut at the Purple Onion in San Francisco, she
appeared in the movie "Splendor in the Grass" (1961), the sitcom "The
Pruitts of Southampton" (1966-67) and the variety show "The Beautiful
Phyllis Diller Show" (1968).</TE>
<TE>   In 1970 she starred in "Hello, Dolly!" on Broadway after Carol
Channing, Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye and Betty Grable. Diller was
then in more than a dozen movies--often with Bob Hope--and she was in
countless TV specials, including every Bob Hope Christmas Special
from 1965 through 1994.</TE>
<TE>   She calls Hope her mentor and named her living room the Bob Hope
Salon, where she keeps a large oil painting of the comedian on an
artist's easel. "Sitting at the knees of the master," she said,
taking a seat beside the portrait.</TE>
<TE>   Diller has names for many of the 22 rooms in her house.</TE>
<TE>   There is the Edith Head, a powder room named after the famous
costume designer; and the John Wilkes Booth, a telephone room named
for the actor who shot Abe Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   There was the Lincoln bedroom, complete with furniture from
Lincoln's time, but the bedroom became an office after Diller's
children grew up and left home.</TE>
<TE>   The Sarah Siddons Room, named for a wildly popular 18th century
English actress whose portrayals of victims epitomized suffering, is
the dining room. Diller is known as a fine cook, but she laughingly
calls one of her own recipes "Garbage Soup."</TE>
<TE>   The Canary Suite is a yellow guest room.</TE>
<TE>   The Giuseppe Verdi Suite, named for the  Italian composer, is
another guest room, decorated in green. (The Italian word for green
is verde.)</TE>
<TE>   The Pump Room has a pump organ in it.</TE>
<TE>   The Bach Room, named for the German composer, is her office,
which, despite her large, somewhat cluttered desk at one end, could
be a salon for recitals. On a stage at the opposite end of the room
sits a Kawai grand piano, which Diller doesn't need much persuasion
to play. Her concert grand, a Chickering, is in the Hope Salon off
the Gothic Alcove, where she keeps a hand-painted 17th century
Italian chest.</TE>
<TE>   Her wig and costume room is upstairs. In it are wigs of every
color. How many? She responds with her signature laugh. "I never
counted."</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs is the loggia, which Diller calls "the heart of the
house, because everyone stops here, between the front door and the
bar." Beyond the loggia are Diller's gardens, filled with roses,
stocks and pansies. The stucco house, on an acre, is built around a
courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   Diller likes to sit by a window in the loggia and read scripts,
the newspaper, art books and the mail. "I love the friendly feeling
of this room," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby is the Scarlet Scullery, her name for the kitchen, where
she often makes salads and pastas or sauerkraut, mashed potatoes and
pork. She is also known to make her own recipe for Glory Glory
Cacciatore, and she once marketed something she labeled Philly Dilly

<TE>   True to its name, the Scarlet Scullery is painted red. It wasn't
red when she moved in. She first painted it that way 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Red is her favorite color. "I think that's because in my
childhood, everything was very dull," she said. "Red represents my
newfound happiness."</TE>
<TE>   Much of that happiness came with buying her house in sunny
Southern California, far from the cold temperatures of Ohio, where
she was born and studied music before heading to Chicago. But total
happiness came, she said, "quite late in life."</TE>
<TE>   Last year she was the first woman to be honored on the Friars Club
Wall of Fame, a reflection of her having made it as a female comic in
what was then a male profession. The Friars Club of California,
started by comic-actor George Burns and his friends in 1946, has more
than 400 members, mostly in the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   While gratified by the Friars Club honor, Diller said she is
proudest of her kids. Not surprisingly, her fondest memories of the
house have had to do with her children. "The fun times were the
outdoor times because I have these huge lawns where we flew kites and
played baseball and croquet."</TE>
<TE>   But she didn't move even after her children left home because, she
said, "this house is perfect for me. I never want to leave. In fact,
when I moved in, I said, 'I hope I go out of here feet first.'"</TE>

<HD>Moisture May Be to Blame for Odor, Bugs</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: After moving into our house, we began to notice some
troubling signs. There was mold on the bathroom floor, persistent
carpet odors in the bedrooms and the frequent appearance of sow bugs
along the walls. The odors are worst during wet weather, and treating
them with carpet cleaners has not helped.</LD>
<LD>   Should we be worried about water under the floor, and can we
figure out what's going on without ripping up the floors?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The one vital fact that's missing from your letter is
whether your home is built on a raised foundation or a concrete slab.
Either way, you apparently have a ground moisture problem requiring
evaluation by a drainage specialist.</LD>
<TE>   If your home is built on a raised foundation, it is likely that
ventilation of the subarea is inadequate. Excessive ground moisture
and a lack of sufficient venting promote unpleasant odors and draw
bugs.</TE>
<TE>   Of greater concern, however, is the potential for fungus and
dry-rot damage to the subfloor and framing structure. This should be
evaluated by a licensed pest control operator (commonly known as a
termite inspector).</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if your home is built on a slab, ground
moisture could be seeping through the concrete. Elimination of
interior moisture in a slab home could be more difficult, as
waterproofing an existing slab is usually not very effective. In that
case, reducing the amount of ground water under the building would be
the main goal.</TE>
<TE>   For a general overview of the moisture problem and consequential
defects, a qualified home inspector should be employed. For a
detailed evaluation of drainage conditions and advice on eliminating
ground moisture, a contractor who specializes in drainage mitigation
should be consulted.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, some forms of mold are known to cause health problems.
Therefore, professional sampling and testing of the mold in your home
would be advisable.</TE>
<TE>   Plastic Drain Lines Can Amplify Water Sounds</TE>
<TE>   Q: We just purchased a new home and have noticed an unusual
problem. When the upstairs toilets are flushed, we can hear the water
flowing loudly inside the wall. Sometimes it is very annoying.</TE>
<TE>   We had the house inspected before closing escrow, but the
inspector did not mention this in the report.</TE>
<TE>   Is there something that can be done or is this normal?</TE>
<TE>   A: The noise you hear is toilet effluent running down the
drainpipe inside the wall. Residential drain lines are typically
composed of plastic. This material, being light and moderately
flexible, tends to amplify the sound of rushing water, especially in
vertical piping where the flow is rapid.</TE>
<TE>   In older homes, drainpipes usually consist of cast iron and steel.
This significantly reduces the noise of water flow because the mass
and rigidity of the material makes it less prone to vibration.</TE>
<TE>   Substantial noise reduction would entail wall surgery. This, of
course, would be costly as well as intrusive. Many people in your
situation would simply put up with the noise.</TE>
<TE>   A Good Inspection Can't Be Done in One Hour</TE>
<TE>   Q: When we bought our home six months ago, our inspector spent
about one hour on the site, and his only recommendation was that the
builder paint the top edges of all the doors.</TE>
<TE>   We learned later that our neighbors' home inspectors typically
spent three to four hours on those inspections and produced long
lists of items for the builder to correct.</TE>
<TE>   Since moving in, we haven't found any major problems, but we've
definitely noticed some things that our inspector should have
reported.</TE>
<TE>   We're planning to raise some issues with the inspector but would
first like your opinion.</TE>
<TE>   A: No home inspector, regardless of his or her qualifications or
experience, can perform a worthwhile inspection in one hour. It
simply cannot be done. There are no exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, any inspector who performs one-hour inspections is
taking financial advantage of home buyers, while missing innumerable
property defects.</TE>
<TE>   The undisclosed problems you've discovered so far are only the
beginning.</TE>
<TE>   You need to obtain a second home inspection to gain the full
picture of what you've bought.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever inspected your neighbors' homes would probably be a good
bet. Once you've acquired a more detailed report, you'll know how to
approach the one-hour inspector.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I rent a room in a private home and need to move in two
weeks because of a job change. The landlady says I can't move until
she has received my 30-day notice. I've paid rent for this month and
don't want any of the rent returned. Is it true--can she keep me from
moving?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: No, you can move any time you wish but there may be
financial consequences if your property owner wants, but doesn't get,
an advance notice from you. An advance notice (from either party) to
end a tenancy is required unless the receiving party agrees to waive
this requirement.</LD>
<LD>   For month-to-month tenants, California Civil Code 1946 states that
the time required for advance notice is governed by the amount of
time between rent payments. For example, if you pay rent weekly, you
must give (or get) at least seven days' advance notice to move; if
you pay rent monthly, you must give (or get) at least 30 days'
advance notice. However, this code prohibits notice of less than
seven days regardless of the length of time between rent payments.</LD>
<TE>   Since your property owner wants advance notice, she could charge
you for rent beyond your early move-out date. To minimize additional
rent charges beyond your move-out date, you should immediately give
your property owner a move-out notice. Once this happens and you
move, you are not responsible for rent beyond the 30-day notice or if
the unit is re-rented before the end of your 30-day notice.</TE>
<TE>   Your local mediation program should be able to help you and the
property owner resolve this matter if both of you are willing.</TE>
<TE>   Notices to Tenants Are Valid if Properly Served</TE>
<TE>   Q: I own a rental duplex and have decided to require tenants to
sign notices I give them so the notices are valid. One of the tenants
has a boat parked in an area that blocks part of the driveway for the
other tenants. When I asked him to sign a three-day notice to move
the boat, he refused. Can't I require my tenants to sign my notices?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is no California civil code that requires a tenant to
sign notices from the landlord, agent or property owner. The same is
true for notices a tenant gives to  his or her landlord, agent or
property owner.</TE>
<TE>   Notices are valid if they are completed and served properly. The
notice you are referring to is a 3-Day Notice to Perform Covenant or
Quit. This requires a tenant to correct a condition or violation,
such as "relocate the boat or vacate the premises." The best type of
service for this notice is to hand it personally to the tenant. Once
this occurs, service is complete and the tenant should correct the
situation. Other types of service require two steps, such as posting
the notice on the door or handing it to a third party, and then also
mailing a copy by first-class mail to the tenant.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid a potential disagreement regarding the time period needed
to comply, if you do either of the two-step service types, it is wise
to add five days to the time period for the tenant to comply. Keep a
copy of all tenant notices.</TE>
<TE>   Modify Rent Agreement to Encompass Late Fees</TE>
<TE>   Q: Some tenants pay their rent late each month. Eventually they do
pay, but I think their payment history should be on their credit
report. Can I add this to their credit report or add a late fee?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is no procedure to add a tenant's rent payment history to
a credit report unless you have a contractual relationship with a
credit bureau or have obtained a money judgment through the court
system. You are allowed to charge a late fee that closely relates to
a financial loss you experience when the rent is paid late, but the
amount must be part of the rental agreement. You can modify the
rental agreement and add the late fee requirement with a 30-Day
Change of Terms Notice.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with late fees is that they are difficult to collect.
If you send a bill for the late fees, the tenant may decide not to
pay.</TE>
<TE>   There is disagreement as to whether late fees can be deducted from
a security deposit when a tenant moves. Civil Code 1950 does not
include late fees as a deductible item. It may be necessary to pursue
the collection of unpaid late fees through the small claims court
process.</TE>

<DL>FREDERICK SOUND, Alaska</DL>
<LD>I was transfixed. A colossal vertical wall surrounded the entire
tree-covered island in the distance, making it look like an
otherworldly fortress. As I strained to get a better look, Lee
Burrows, our shipboard naturalist, explained: "It's a fata morgana."</LD>
<LD>   Named for Morgan le Fay, King Arthur's legendary fairy half-sister
and sorceress, this type of marine optical illusion conjures up
strange visions and distortions, like a mirage created by heat waves
in a desert. As our ship moved I began to see through the illusion,
which had transformed the watery reflection of the island's trees
into an apparition of a huge stockade.</LD>
<LD>   But I had already fallen under the spell of Alaska's Inside
Passage, and halfway through our eight-day cruise nothing surprised
me anymore. The fata morgana was just another of the daily marvels on
this magical filigree of land and sea stretching from Vancouver,
Canada, to Skagway, Alaska. The inland waterway meanders past
mountains, dazzling glaciers, fiords and islands, some inhabited only
by bears, bald eagles and other denizens of the far north.</LD>
<TE>   Our cruise aboard the Safari Quest, a 120-foot, 21-passenger
yacht, began in Juneau and ended in Sitka, about 100 miles southwest
as the raven flies. Bill Gates and Chuck Norris have chartered these
comfortable, well-appointed vessels, which are operated by the
Washington state-based American Safari Cruises. Though we're not in
same tax bracket, my husband, Aubrey, and I decided on a splurge trip
last May to celebrate a promotion and a second honeymoon.</TE>
<TE>   Our trip was expensive (about $3,500 each), though it was a good
value for the money and combined all the things we wanted: physical
activity, adventure, luxury, nature interpretation and wildlife
viewing but without crowds, cruise ships or mass tourism. The price
also included all shore excursions, meals and snacks and a 24-hour
open bar. I have taken less expensive cruises on which many of those
things cost extra and greatly inflated the base price. And now, with
so many ships relocating to Alaska after Sept. 11, the yacht would be
a good way to avoid waters crowded with cruise ships.</TE>
<TE>   Our small craft could go into quiet coves and inlets that no big
cruise ship could negotiate, and could stop or change course at will
to observe wildlife. We could paddle every day in the yacht's fleet
of sea kayaks or explore in its motorized Zodiac. Best of all, we
would have the wilderness to ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Given the cost of the trip, I worried that we might be cruising
with a bunch of snooty upper-crusters, but our shipmates turned out
to be working people with not a snob or movie star in the bunch.
Among them were four couples from Jackson, Miss., who had been
friends since college. They were continuous sources of entertainment,
especially Beau Whittington, with his stand-up comedic Cajun
monologues. Also part of the "Mississippi eight" was an attorney,
appropriately named Crymes Pittman, who always seemed to have an
insightful comment or amusing observation. The Lokeys, a Florida
couple, had brought their college-age son and daughter, whose vegan
diet seemed to present no challenge to our chef.</TE>
<TE>   Although the atmosphere was intimate and the yacht small, we
didn't feel crowded, since the ship had four decks. On top was a
large observation deck with chairs and a hot tub; below were smaller
covered outdoor decks and a library. A roomy main salon with the bar
served as the social center and was lined with large windows and
comfortable upholstered seats. The salon, where Lee gave daily nature
lectures, had a built-in video screen and a sizable video library.</TE>
<TE>   The staterooms, which varied in size and price, were not spacious
but were still comfortable. The smallest and least expensive were on
the lower deck, where we stayed, and had tiny windows that required a
person to stand on the bed to look out. The largest, the "admiral's
staterooms," were on the upper deck and had sliding glass doors,
small balconies and twin or queen-size beds.</TE>
<TE>   The ship's crew members were bright, well traveled and
sophisticated. They knew our names within minutes of meeting us, and
after a few days we learned theirs too.</TE>
<TE>   After a night's stay in Juneau we met our 19 fellow passengers and
together motored in an antique touring car to the inspiring
700-foot-high Mendenhall Glacier. Late that afternoon, Safari Quest
cruised out of Juneau's busy harbor, our trim vessel dwarfed by huge
cruise ships. We were headed for a night's anchorage at Taku Harbor.
Unlike other cruise liners, the yacht cruised only during the day so
passengers could view the scenery and wildlife along the way. We
weren't covering great distances, but rather weaving in and out of
coves and inlets.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, after about an hour's journey, we entered Tracy
Arm, one of Alaska's most beautiful fiords, 30 miles long and only a
half-mile wide at its upper end. We were the only vessel in this
sheltered finger of calm water favored by kayakers and too narrow for
large cruise ships. (In fact, other than in Juneau, we never saw a
cruise ship during our voyage, although one day we passed the Alaska
State Ferry.)</TE>
<TE>   I felt as though I was in a trance as Safari Quest glided silently
up the channel. Near-vertical granite walls rose 2,000 feet out of
the green water. Silvery cascades of snowmelt tumbled down immense
rock faces. Blue icebergs, sculpted into graceful shapes, drifted
past. Arctic loons fluttered above the water's surface, and murrelets
bobbed like ducks. Clouds shrouded the rocky, domelike peaks, and
rust, tan and green tinted the rocks at the water's edge.</TE>
<TE>   Aubrey and I were a little dismayed when our first two days dawned
gray, cloudy and occasionally drizzly, typical Alaskan weather.
Luckily, we were blessed with blue skies and sunshine for the rest of
our voyage.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Arm dead-ends at Sawyer Glaciers, and when we arrived there
late in the morning, harbor seals were basking on the ice floes.
"Seals are safe from killer whales here because of glacial till in
the water," Lee told us. "It's like driving in fog, so the whales
rarely venture near the glaciers."</TE>
<TE>   But we did. In the motorized, inflatable Zodiac, we slalomed
around icebergs up to blue walls of ice hundreds of feet high--but
not too close, because chunks could calve at a moment's notice,
creating large waves.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who had abandoned a graduate degree in biology, had a special
interest in birds, and her breadth of knowledge was fascinating.
Aubrey and I are casual but semi-serious, longtime birders, and
thanks to Lee we learned to distinguish arctic birds that we had
never seen and barely heard of. But birds weren't the only wildlife
we became more familiar with.</TE>
<TE>   A hushed alert quickly spread from stem to stern: a bear! Capt.
Travis Stephens edged the boat 30 feet from shore, where a coal-black
bear ambled across the rocks. Just out of hibernation, he was hungry
and clawing up clumps of barnacles and seaweed, undisturbed by the
clicking of a dozen cameras. As the day progressed we spotted more
bears, some on ledges, others on beaches.</TE>
<TE>   That evening at our anchorage in Snug Cove, Aubrey and I
luxuriated by ourselves in the hot tub, sipping wine and watching
grizzlies, which seemed to be having a good time of their own
onshore.</TE>
<TE>   Life aboard ship was relaxed. Every afternoon we munched on
freshly baked cookies in the salon. We had a large selection of fine
wines and spirits along with Alaskan and other microbrews at the bar.
Daily cocktail hour was always popular since it included a variety of
savory appetizers--giant shrimp, miniature quiches or a platter of
olives, fresh veggies, hummus, baba ghannouj and pitas. With so much
to do and see each day, people rarely frequented the bar, except
perhaps to have a beer after a hike or kayaking. Our trip was
thankfully free of any heavy drinkers or barflies.</TE>
<TE>   Salads of field greens, vegetables and herbs grown in the ship's
galley preceded every dinner. We had a choice of entrees, usually
seafood, chicken or red meat, but vegetarian dinners were also
available. One night at a stop, the chef bought enough salmon for the
next night's dinner. And dessert--chocolate mousse, cheesecake or
fresh fruit with sorbets made on board--never disappointed. Our days
began with freshly baked croissants and other pastries at the bar,
followed by full breakfasts in the dining room.</TE>
<TE>   (We were surprised to learn recently of a Centers for Disease
Control score of 68--below 85 is considered not satisfactory--in an
inspection of the Safari Quest last May. The low rating was due to
several factors--including on-board water facilities and food
storage--but from our observations, the ship and everything on it
appeared immaculate. American Safari president Don Blanchard says the
company had already made alterations on board to comply with CDC
requirements and more would be made before its next sailing season in
May.)</TE>
<TE>   In Frederick Sound the next day, in the middle of lunch, a cry of
"orcas!" rang out. We left the table in mid-bite, racing for our
cameras, coats and binoculars. From the ship's deck we spotted our
first two orcas, also known as killer whales, then four, then eight,
their smart tuxedo markings bright against the steely waters as they
leaped, dove and spouted. A mother and baby swam past, followed by a
big male, his dorsal fin like a tall black sail. On the lowest deck,
just above water level, we could practically reach out and touch
them.</TE>
<TE>   One day Crymes said he spotted some Sitka deer. "There are seven
or eight of them on the beach," he said. "I can see the white of
their [tails]." We looked through our binoculars and, to everyone's
amusement, realized that Crymes' deer derrieres were the heads of
bald eagles. By the end of the cruise we had seen so many of the
regal birds that we lost count.</TE>
<TE>   Kayaking, one of my favorite daily treats, brought us closer to
wildlife. One day in a cove, Aubrey and I paddled our double kayak
near the shore and watched a foraging grizzly and a capering mink
within a stone's throw of each other--and us. Though the bears are
shy and often retreated into the brush when they saw us, we kept our
distance.</TE>
<TE>   "The strongest muscle in the animal kingdom is in the tail of a
humpback whale," Lee said, and for days we had been scanning the
water for them. Finally we saw some of the huge but graceful flukes
as a pod of humpbacks, each adult the size of a bus, dove to feed.
They seemed to move in slow motion, but I still had difficulty trying
to capture them on film.</TE>
<TE>   Our next stop was Petersburg, a village of about 3,300 people
settled by Norwegians in the 1890s on Mitkof Island, which is
accessible only by boat or plane. The small port was packed with
bright fishing boats, and veils of cloud trailed below the snowy
peaks surrounding it. Our excursion included a visit to a shrimp
cannery; fishing is Petersburg's chief industry. "My father opened
the cannery in 1906," owner Patti Norheim told us. She said she has
lived in Petersburg for 71 years. "But that's no indication of my
age. I had a hip replacement and it took 20 years off my life, so now
I'm 51," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Late that afternoon some of us headed aloft in a De Havilland
Beaver float plane--the workhorse of Alaska--over Le Conte Glacier.
The iceberg-choked Le Conte Bay ends at this behemoth tongue of
tormented ancient ice and snow. "You felt like you were suspended in
time," Crymes remarked afterward. "It was surreal."</TE>
<TE>   As our cruise continued we saw thundering waterfalls, hiked to hot
springs and took in a stop at Murder Cove. Site of an abandoned
whaling station, the cove's ominous name gave us pause as we climbed
out of the Zodiac onto the gravel beach. A lone figure carrying a
shotgun walked toward us.</TE>
<TE>   The gun-toter was Leeann Keeler, a former hospice nurse and home
health care worker from Oregon. "Now I'm packin' weapons," she said.
Not for us, she explained, but for bears. "There are five 500-pound
grizzly sows wandering around here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Keeler and her husband, Dale, "a Wyoming cowboy," are the sole
human inhabitants of this remote Alaskan cove, where they are
building a small guest lodge.</TE>
<TE>   All too soon we pulled into Sitka. That night was our shipboard
"last supper," the only slightly dressy occasion we had, complete
with a moving reading from retired professor Sol Kimerling's personal
journal. Then crew and passengers headed to a local bar filled with
smoke, music and lively Alaskans.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, after heartfelt farewells, we disembarked. Aubrey
and I set off to explore Sitka for several days on our own, during
which we fantasized about buying a boat there and spending our lives
exploring the Inside Passage.</TE>

<HD>Deal of the Week: Grand Canyon Train</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Visiting Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park on a rail-hotel package
is cheaper in winter and has other advantages, such as smaller
crowds, snowy scenery and often better views of the canyon than in
the smoggy summer. The two-night, three-day "Canyon Railway Express
Package," good through March 15, gives you one night at the Fray
Marcos Hotel in Williams, Ariz., and one night at the park's Maswik
Lodge; round-trip coach train fare on the Grand Canyon Railway
between Williams and the canyon, 65 miles away; a choice of two
canyon tours, from two to four hours long; and one breakfast and one
dinner. The cost is $159 per adult (plus taxes and $8 park
admission), double occupancy, versus $229 in peak season. Children
ages 2 to 16 cost $35.50 year-round. Book at least 11 days in
advance. Other discounted packages are also available. (800)

<HD>Amtrak Charter Lets Players Ride the Rails to Las Vegas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This spring, paying passengers will ride the rails between Los
Angeles and Las Vegas for the first time since Amtrak's Desert Wind
train stopped running in 1997. But so far only four trips are
scheduled.</LD>
<LD>   Key Holidays, a company based in Walnut Creek, Calif., that has
been an Amtrak tour operator for nearly two decades, is chartering
14-car trains from Amtrak to make weekend runs departing Los Angeles'
Union Station on April 12 and May 3 and weekday runs departing April
16 and May 7. The journey takes a little more than seven hours each
way, with stops in Fullerton and San Bernardino.</LD>
<LD>   For $195 to $385 per person midweek, double occupancy, and $249 to
$489 for the weekend, guests get round-trip train fare, two nights'
lodging, transfers and lunch on the return trip, said Key Holidays
president Henry Luna. Weekend trips, limited to adults 21 and older,
also include dinner and a dance car with a live band. Children ages 2
to 11 are allowed on the weekday trips for $89. Prices vary by the
hotel chosen.</LD>
<TE>   No more trips are scheduled this year because a contract with
Union Pacific limits the trips to two a month, and in summer the
trains are used elsewhere by Amtrak, Luna said. See a travel agent,
call (800) 783-0783 or visit www.keyholidays.com.</TE>
<TE>   The new tours come as long-awaited plans for a new rail siding,
which Amtrak says will help it cut up to two hours off the L.A.-Las
Vegas journey and allow it to renew regular service, remain stalled
over environmental concerns.</TE>

<HD>Cruise Ship Changes Ports on Big Island</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norwegian Cruise Line has changed the Big Island port for its weekly
Norwegian Star cruises in Hawaii from Kona to Hilo, and last week it
was considering whether to switch its Maui port from Lahaina to
Kahului.</LD>
<LD>   The problem in both cases is that the original ports require
sometimes lengthy tendering of passengers to shore, said Andrew
Stuart, NCL senior vice president of marketing and sales. The
alternative ports have docking facilities for the 2,244-passenger
ship.</LD>
<LD>   Stuart also confirmed that the Star could not put passengers
ashore on Fanning Island in Kiribati, 500 miles south of Hawaii, for
two of the ship's six sailings this season because of bad weather.</LD>
<TE>   Under U.S. law, as a foreign-flagged vessel, the Star must include
a foreign port on its itinerary.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaiian Sen. Daniel Inouye last month said he might consider
backing legislation to exempt Hawaii from the law, called the Jones
Act, if foreign-flagged ships employ U.S. citizens as crews and
follow other U.S. laws.</TE>
<TE>   Norwegian is the only cruise line with weekly sailings in Hawaii
since American Classic Voyages filed for Chapter 11 reorganization
last year.</TE>

<HD>Say Aloha to Traffic Cameras in Hawaii</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Speeding tourists on Oahu, beware: Your car is on camera.</LD>
<LD>   Hawaii has begun issuing so-called photo-enforcement tickets to
drivers who violate speed limits on 15 roadways on Oahu, including
Pali, Nimitz and Kamehameha highways. Fines are substantial, and
visitors may not learn they have been ticketed until they leave the
island.</LD>
<LD>   The tickets are issued after cameras on vans photograph the
license plates of accused speeders. (The cameras are activated when a
laser gun detects excessive speed, officials say.) Vehicle owners are
supposed to be notified of the citation by mail in three days.</LD>
<TE>   But for visitors who rent cars, the process may take longer. At
the Avis station at Honolulu International Airport, administrative
assistant Raven Waikiki said her office receives photo-enforcement
tickets about a week after the violation, then sends them to traffic
court for additional processing and forwarding to the renter. Her
station had received 25 such citations as of last week, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The fine is $27 plus $5 for every mile per hour over the speed
limit. If the ticket is unpaid after 15 days, the fine goes to $52
plus $5 for each mile over the limit.</TE>
<TE>   The photo enforcement program, which began in early January, has
created an uproar among some residents, who say it invades their
privacy, among other complaints. But Hawaii's Department of
Transportation says the program is needed to stem an epidemic of
speeding. For more information, visit the department's Internet site,
www.state.hi.us/dot/publicaffairs/ photoenforcement.</TE>

<HD>Three for the Luxury in Mexico, San Francisco</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What recession? This winter is bringing a bumper crop of high-end
hotels. Among them are two in Mexico and one in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   The ritziest, judged by the room rates, is the 56-room Esperanza
in Mexico, which opened this weekend. The hotel, perched on bluffs
overlooking two private coves on the Gulf of California about four
miles north of Cabo San Lucas, is run by the people who operate San
Ysidro Ranch near Santa Barbara, Auberge du Soleil in Napa Valley and
four other California hotels. Its restaurant is headed by French chef
Jacques Chretien, former executive chef at Maxim's de Paris in Mexico
City. Also on site is a spa (opening in summer), bar and gourmet
market. Rates begin at $550 per night. (866) 311-2226,
www.esperanzaresort.com.</LD>
<LD>   On the other side of Mexico, the Presidente Inter-Continental
Paraiso de la Bonita ("beautiful woman's paradise") opened last month
on the coast about 12 miles south of Cancun, one of several upscale
hotels developed in the last few years in the so-called Mayan
Riviera. Its 14 acres include a 90-room hotel, three restaurants, a
bar, a swimming pool and a 22,000-square-foot spa that features
thalassotherapy, which uses heated seawater and marine algae. Rates
begin at $410 per room per night through April 30, then increase to
$550. (800) 327-0200, www.interconti.com.</LD>
<TE>   In San Francisco, the former Financial Center Building at 500
California St. downtown is being converted into a 362-room luxury
hotel scheduled to open Feb. 11. The 17-story Florentine
Renaissance-style structure, which dates to the mid-1920s and has
been unoccupied for a decade, has undergone a $100-million
restoration, a hotel spokesman said. It includes a bar, gym and
steakhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The Omni San Francisco Hotel is owned by Texas-based Omni Hotels.
Introductory rates start at $189 through May 12; then published rates
start at $439. (800) 843-6664, www.omnisanfrancisco.com.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>February is the focal point of a yearlong celebration of the
centennial of John Steinbeck's birth in Monterey County, where the
author grew up. Dozens of events are also scheduled throughout the
year in California and New York.</LD>
<LD>   This weekend an exhibit focused on the friendship between
Steinbeck and marine biologist Ed Ricketts opened at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium; it runs through December. Starting Feb. 9 there will be
weekend tours for $45 per person this month that visit Steinbeck's
Monterey, his grave and other sites.</LD>
<LD>   Events Feb. 21 to 24 include free performances of a play based on
Steinbeck's "The Long Valley" in Salinas; lectures and book signings
of the centennial edition of his "America and Americans" by
co-editors Jackson Benson and Susan Shillinglaw; tours of Steinbeck's
childhood home in Salinas, where brunch will be served ($25); and the
first of three performances by the Monterey Symphony of a work by
Allen Shawn and Jamaica Kincaid commissioned for the centennial
(tickets $15 to $46).</LD>
<TE>   On Steinbeck's birthday, Feb. 27, there will be a book sale; a
free birthday ceremony at the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas
and another one, with dinner ($20 per person), in Monterey. For
information on events, call (831) 775-4721 or visit www.steinbeck.org

<HD>Pole Position Near Tahoe's Royal Gorge</HD>
<DH>Father and son get in the swing at nation's largest
cross-country resort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SODA SPRINGS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>My son and I had tried cross-country skiing once--for about an hour
on a trip more than 10 years ago. All I remembered was not getting
far but still finding solitude, the only sound coming from my
pounding heart.</LD>
<LD>   For my son, now 21, the memories of our brief outing were even
dimmer.</LD>
<LD>   I persuaded Joe that we should try again at Royal Gorge, the
largest cross-country ski resort in North America, with more than 220
miles of trails for skiers of all abilities.</LD>
<TE>   That is how we came to be among a group of acolytes on a Saturday
morning a few weeks ago. In a relatively flat, snow-covered meadow at
7,000 feet in the Sierra, we waited to receive wisdom from our
cross-country ski instructor, Michael.</TE>
<TE>   Michael gestured toward an accomplished skier gliding across the
meadow on effortless strides that seemed a good five yards long.
Before I could study him in detail, he had disappeared into a stand
of evergreens.</TE>
<TE>   "Notice how he swung his arms like a monkey?" Michael asked.</TE>
<TE>   For the next hour and a half our group of 10 tried to imitate
monkeys.</TE>
<TE>   Michael was patient as we negotiated again and again the same
small piece of terrain, learning the basic stride--knees bent and
arms swinging--then added poles to propel us along.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't difficult, and before long Joe was setting speed records
for our group. Even the most uncoordinated among us was more or less
gliding on machine-groomed tracks that were a ski-width wide and
shoulder width apart.</TE>
<TE>   Joe and I had flown into Reno the night before, rented a car and
driven about 45 miles west on Interstate 80 to the Rainbow Lodge at
Royal Gorge, near the spot where the Donner party got stuck. It was
easy to see why they were forced to halt their journey west. Snow was
piled above our heads on both sides of the road.</TE>
<TE>   The wood-and-stone Rainbow Lodge looked charming from the outside,
and its public rooms, with lacquered pine log furniture and a stone
fireplace, were appealing.</TE>
<TE>   But we were a tad disappointed in the size of our $125-per-night
room, which had a double bed. I had been assured the room would have
enough space for a second bed.</TE>
<TE>   But the flimsy rollaway the inn provided left no place to walk,
and we had to laugh when some of its wooden slats fell to the floor,
along with Joe, as soon as he lay down. Because the inn had no other
cots available, Joe slept on the mattress on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast, included in the room rate, was better. At the inn's
spacious, stone-walled Engadine Cafe, service was attentive, the
table formally set and the food plentiful: a choice of eggs,
pancakes, French toast or hot cereal, along with fresh fruit,
muffins, juice and coffee.</TE>
<TE>   The inn and the jumping-off point for day touring, Summit Station,
are connected by a winding 13 1/2-mile back-country trail rated for
experts. That left us out. We drove, along the way passing
opportunities for downhill skiing and dog sledding.</TE>
<TE>   At Summit Station we signed up for the Super Package: rented
cross-country skis, boots (which turned out to be more like
comfortable slippers than the hard plastic kind downhill skiers use)
and poles, a one-day trail pass and a group lesson for about $49 per
person.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the employees, we noticed, were Australians. They
explained that they were ski lovers who come to Royal Gorge to work
and ski when it's summer Down Under.</TE>
<TE>   Our instructor, Michael, was one of the few employees from the
States.</TE>
<TE>   After we had mastered the flats, he had us move to a little hill.</TE>
<TE>   The big difference between cross-country and downhill skiing, I
soon found out, is that cross-country is a lot more work. No ski
lifts take you up the hills (although Royal Gorge does have some tow
ropes for the really steep ones). Mostly, you self-propel.</TE>
<TE>   Michael taught us how to point the tops of our skis together and
walk on their inside edges on inclines. Then he showed us the proper
tuck position for zooming down.</TE>
<TE>   After teaching a little more about how to brake and turn, he said
we were ready to tackle trails on our own.</TE>
<TE>   A few in the group were skeptical and decided to abort, but we
were game.</TE>
<TE>   Quite a few signposted trails start at the meadow. Michael
suggested we take the one named Yuba; he said it was intermediate,
but the trail map listed it as easy.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be a sufficiently challenging five-mile round
trip over gently rolling terrain, through a glorious forest of
snow-laden firs and past spectacular mountain views.</TE>
<TE>   I imagined relaxing--being at one with the forest--as I moved, but
alas, this was not to be. I had to concentrate too much on swinging
my arms like a monkey.</TE>
<TE>   The trail, like all others at the resort, was groomed. The width
of a fire road, it had a pair of machine-carved ski tracks on each
side. The middle was reserved for something I'd never seen before:
ski skaters, who use a side-to-side motion similar to that used by
ice and in-line skaters.</TE>
<TE>   Accomplished Nordic skiers who, darn it, did not seem to be
breathing heavily also passed by. Some were even pulling kids on
sleds.</TE>
<TE>   After about 50 minutes and several spills and stops to catch my
breath, we reached Wilderness Lodge, the more expensive accommodation
at Royal Gorge, located at a trail junction in the middle of the
forest.</TE>
<TE>   Guests are taken to Wilderness Lodge by motorized sleigh and plied
with breakfast, lunch buffets and dinner by candlelight for $169
daily per person on weekends. They enjoy the luxury of skiing right
outside their door and returning to a sauna or a dip in a hot tub.</TE>
<TE>   We, however, just had sandwiches at the lodge's cafe and headed
back. It had started snowing steadily, but that proved no obstacle.
We made better time even though the way back was more uphill.</TE>
<TE>   For a diversion, Joe decided to take one of the tow-rope lifts up
a particularly steep hill. I watched as he took a few spills coming
down. But he was determined, and after a few tries he made it without
a fall.</TE>
<TE>   Not me. I was determined to make it through the weekend without
getting hurt. When we got back to Summit Station, we were tired, but
it seemed too early to call it a day.</TE>
<TE>   We spent another hour or so practicing, me on the hill Michael had
started us on (which now seemed tame), Joe on another, steeper hill,
where experts were practicing swift, sharp turns.</TE>
<TE>   Back at Rainbow Lodge we compared notes on what ached, read and
took naps before dinner at the Engadine Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   Joe had French onion soup and veal scaloppine. I had a spinach
salad with goat cheese, walnuts and thin slices of Asian pear,
followed by duck breast with lingonberry sauce, which turned out to
be overly ambitious. But a nice bottle of Merlot and the cozy setting
more than made up for it.</TE>
<TE>   There are no televisions or guest phones at the inn--no
distractions other than board games, conversation and a crackling
fire. We whiled away the evening talking, playing Scrabble and
finding out how much I don't know about popular culture, according to
the makers of Trivial Pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Then we headed to bed. The inn had provided a new rollaway, but it
didn't look any more stable than the first, so Joe hauled its
mattress to the floor again.</TE>
<TE>   Rain fell the next morning. We looked for an expert--someone with
his own skis--and asked what to expect. He said dryly that we should
expect to get wet. Other than that, he said, skiing would be fine. So
we rented skis and bought passes for a second day on the trails.</TE>
<TE>   Royal Gorge, at least on this Sunday, seemed a different
place--almost deserted. We tackled the Yuba trail again and then
others. The forest looked different too. The snow was still deep, but
the rain had knocked it off tree branches. Tracks were slicker and we
went faster.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that also was because we were better. That's the
difference a day makes.</TE>

<HD>Not on Board? Too Bad, That Will Still Cost You</HD>
<DH>Cruise lines remain strict with cancellation policies, even
after terrorist attacks. And trip insurance may not cover the fare
loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've been thinking about this question a lot lately: How can you hand
over thousands of dollars for a product, decline to accept delivery
of it and have no recourse for recovering your money? The answer:
Book a cruise, then cancel it.</LD>
<LD>   "Would you please discuss the exorbitant cancellation penalty of
cruise lines?" San Clemente residents Richard and Ena Proctor
recently wrote in an e-mail. "Their policy is to keep the entire cost
of the cruise, instead of a reasonable amount to cover their
reasonable costs.... Most airlines will give you credit for a future
flight, and hotels only charge for the first night.... We would
understand cruise lines keeping, say, one-quarter or one-third of the
total cost, but to keep thousands of dollars is unreasonable, unfair
and just plain greedy."</LD>
<LD>   Here is the Proctors' story:</LD>
<TE>   On Friday morning, Sept. 21, just before heading out for John
Wayne Airport in Orange County to fly to Boston for a New England
cruise on Royal Caribbean International, departing the next day, they
saw this headline on a TV newscast: "Atty. Gen. Ashcroft says Boston
next site of terrorist attack, possibly this weekend." They called
friends in Boston who said they were "terrified" and wouldn't go
downtown, Richard says.</TE>
<TE>   The Proctors phoned American Airlines to cancel their flight.
"They were wonderful," Richard says. The couple got a credit for a
future flight.</TE>
<TE>   Then they called the Hyatt Harborside Hotel in Boston, where they
had a room reserved. The hotel said, "Don't worry about it. We won't
charge you for the night," waiving its 24-hour cancellation penalty,
Richard says.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the Proctors say, they called Royal Caribbean. "They said
they were sorry," Richard says. "The grace period was up, and the
cancellation fee was the entire cost of the cruise." (Royal
Caribbean, like many lines, waived cancellation penalties for a few
days after the Sept. 11 attacks.) The couple was out $2,277 in cruise
fares.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attack in Boston never materialized. Nor, to date,
has the Proctors' money, despite two letters to Royal Caribbean CEO
Richard Fain, they say.</TE>
<TE>   In a Dec. 12 letter to the Proctors denying their request, Fain
cited the "hundreds of personnel required for each sailing" plus the
expense of food, entertainment and port charges as "costs that are
not refundable to us. Consequently, the cancellations [sic] penalties
outlined in our brochures have been re-instituted and do apply."</TE>
<TE>   The Proctors' story is not unique. Herbert and Marilyn Piken of
Studio City also saw news reports of Ashcroft's warning on Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   The next day they were to fly to New York and then go on to Boston
for a Holland America cruise departing Sept. 27. (The port was
switched from New York after the attacks.)</TE>
<TE>   The Pikens contacted American Airlines, which gave them a refund,
and their hotel, Le Parker Meridien New York, which also let them
cancel, Herbert says. Then they contacted Holland America. "I thought
for sure we'd get at least a credit from the cruise line," Herbert
says. He was wrong. Several calls and letters to the line later, the
Pikens say they are still out $12,738.</TE>
<TE>   In cases like the Pikens', Holland America must enforce its
cancellation penalty "to keep consistent," spokesman Erik Elvejord
says. If the line had received an official warning to avoid Boston,
there might have been leeway, but "if we were in full operation,
there typically wouldn't have been much wiggle room," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 cast a harsh light on cruise lines'
unforgiving cancellation penalties. At some point between 30 days and
seven days before departure, most major lines will insist on keeping
100% of your fare.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise lines give various explanations for their policies.
Comparing their rules with those of other industries is "like
comparing apples and oranges," says Princess Cruises spokeswoman
Denise Seomin. Unlike hotels and airlines, a cruise line risks losing
income for a week or more if a trip is canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "If we didn't have the cancellation windows that we do ... we
could find ourselves with a lot of open cabins just before sailing,"
says Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz. That's a problem
because unlike airlines or hotels, which she says may be able to
profitably operate at 70% to 75% occupancy, ships need 100%
occupancy. "The fixed costs of operating a cruise ship are enormous,"
she explains.</TE>
<TE>   So what should travelers do to protect themselves?</TE>
<TE>   Buying trip insurance may cover you for last-minute cancellations,
but only under certain circumstances. Typically these include a
medical emergency, a natural disaster, being called for jury duty, or
a hijacking, labor strike or other event that blocks or interrupts
travel, says Claudia Fullerton, chief marketing officer for CSA
Travel Protection in San Diego. Her company will also cover terrorist
incidents within 30 days of your planned arrival--but only in foreign
countries. (Some insurers expanded this provision to U.S. soil after
Sept. 11.)</TE>
<TE>   Being afraid typically isn't reason enough for insurers to pay
off, nor is losing your job or having to work when you were supposed
to be cruising, Fullerton says.</TE>
<TE>   The Pikens, veterans of 22 cruises, hadn't bought trip insurance;
the Proctors had. But it didn't matter. The Proctors' policy didn't
cover nonmedical reasons for canceling, Richard says.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately a growing number of cruise lines have begun selling
waiver programs, similar to insurance policies, that will cover you
if you cancel for any reason up to either the day of departure or a
few days before. They generally offer credit for a future cruise or
sometimes refunds for most or all of the fare. Prices range from
about $40 to several hundred dollars.</TE>
<TE>   I rankle at paying for a policy that can help cruise lines profit
from a situation they have helped cause. From a practical standpoint,
however, I agree with Ed Perkins, travel writer and former consumer
advocate for the American Society of Travel Agents, who says, "I
suspect that for many people, a cancel-for-any-reason policy is a
good idea." He says that "in 30 years of traveling, I've never had to
cancel for medical reasons, but I've had to make last-minute changes
for business reasons many times."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few months, luxury lines Silversea Cruises and Crystal
Cruises began offering cancel-for-any-reason programs. Holland
America, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess and Royal Caribbean have
similar programs. Carnival, Cunard and Seabourn do not.</TE>
<TE>   Other recourses include contacting your credit card company, which
may get a refund for you , or taking the cruise line to small-claims
court, Perkins says. He also suggests that "if you think things might
be iffy ... wait until two or three weeks before sailing" to book
through cruise discounters that sell last-minute cabins. You take a
chance of not getting aboard but may lower your chances of losing
money.</TE>

<KH>SPECIAL CRUISE ISSUE</KH>
<HD>Awash in a Sea of Deals</HD>
<DH>An abundance of ships and a soft economy mean savings--but
for how long?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GILDEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If last year was a difficult one in the travel industry as a whole,
the cruise industry experienced the equivalent of the perfect storm.</LD>
<LD>   Renaissance Cruise Lines and American Classic Voyages, already in
financial straits, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection within
weeks of the terrorist attacks. Other cruise lines, buoyed by the
economic expansion of the last decade, had ordered new ships that
have added thousands of berths and will add thousands more by the
time the shipbuilding boom is over.</LD>
<LD>   And in a story as old as the sea, the big fish are eating the
little fish as big lines buy smaller ones, battling for supremacy in
an industry in which the number of passengers has quadrupled during
the last two decades.</LD>
<TE>   The convergence of these cruise line storms, coupled with a
still-shaky economy, signals some deals dead ahead for anyone,
whether first-timer or veteran, who has been thinking about booking a
cruise. The question now is how long the bargains will last.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise prices began to fall last year soon after the terrorist
attacks. "We held up pretty well right after Sept. 11, but in the
latter part of the year business was off 10% to 15%," says Jim
Godsman, president of the Cruise Line International Assn. (CLIA), a
New York-based industry group that represents 95% of cruise line
companies. "It was then that prices really dipped."</TE>
<TE>   In a study done by the cruise industry in 2000, per diem costs
were used to compare cruises with a land vacation on which travelers
are responsible for lodging, transportation, meals and entertainment,
all of which are included in the price of a cruise. The results,
including air fare for both: $263 per person per day for a land
vacation versus $252 for a typical cruise.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise prices dropped even lower last year, and although fares
currently aren't as cheap as they were last fall, it's still a
buyer's market. Prices on some cruises have fallen below $100 per
day, excluding air fare. And it's not just on the price-sensitive low
end of the market where fares have declined either. Many of the
higher-end lines are quietly offering incentives to fill those ships.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1980, when 1.4 million North American passengers set sail,
the industry has watched the number of passengers grow by 8.4% a
year. By 2000, nearly 6.9 million passengers had hopped on board. But
that's still a fraction of the 68.8 million potential cruisers in
North America.</TE>
<TE>   This growth--and the potential for it--has fueled the greatest
capital investment in new ships in the industry's history, with
hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into construction.</TE>
<TE>   Between now and the end of 2003, 26 new ships will add 50,000
berths, even after accounting for six ships being retired.</TE>
<TE>   For the consumer, this could add up to substantial savings as the
industry struggles to balance supply and demand.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an oversupply in cruising, with some prices I haven't
seen in 15 years," says Judy Lucas, owner of Concierge Cruises and
Tours in Tucson, which specializes in cruises. For travelers who are
considering a cruise, the sooner they can make plans, the better,
Lucas says.</TE>
<TE>   "In December, during the high season, you could have gone on a 12-
to 14-day cruise on a premium ship for $900," she says. Those kinds
of deals are not available now, she says, and the same cruise is as
much as $1,100--still a good value but not the rock-bottom fares of
just weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   In trying to separate the industry hype from the real deals, I
culled the lowest advertised fares from last year at this time and
compared them to like itineraries on the same lines for this year.
What I learned supports the idea that, overall, prices have come down
from last year at this time. (See chart, L7.)</TE>
<TE>   But remember, fares remain fluid; finding them is one challenge,
and getting them is another. And no one is quite certain what the
future might hold.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers think the prices they saw in November will continue,"
says Steve Cosgrove, owner of Dynamic Travel and Cruises in
Southlake, Texas. "A Disney cruise was $399 in November; now it's
$1,299."</TE>
<TE>   And, he adds, "Mickey's going to fill up this summer."</TE>
<TE>   Sale of Sails</TE>
<TE>   "It's not 'Let's Make a Deal,'" Cosgrove says. "Yes, there are
deals, but you have to be selective and flexible."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a sampling of some bargains I found recently comparing
advertised rates, looking on the Web and talking with travel experts.
Some caveats: These fares may have changed by press time or may have
sold out, and your price will vary depending on gateway city, type of
ship and cabin, and a host of other factors. And these prices may not
include port taxes or air fare to distant gateways.</TE>

<TE>   Nailing Down Deals</TE>
<TE>   Booking a ship trip can be a complicated process that requires the
services of an experienced travel agent who specializes in cruises.
There's no sure-fire way to get the sale price of a lifetime, but
there are a couple of helpful strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Louise Slominsky's experience may be typical. After the Fort
Worth, Texas, resident lost her job in January, she decided she
needed a respite before beginning her job search, so she and her
husband, Tim, launched an online search for a cruise vacation, their
second. They wanted a stateroom with a balcony on a seven- to 10-day
Panama Canal trip.</TE>
<TE>   First she did her homework; then she consulted an expert. Armed
with information from Web searches, she sat down with a travel agent,
who had brochures and a better knowledge of the quality of the ships
and types of cabins.</TE>
<TE>   But did she find a bargain?</TE>
<TE>   "Not necessarily," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Because they were booking in late January for the middle of
February, they did not receive the more heavily discounted early
booking fare she had seen in promotional materials. Instead they got
something "between the early booking fare and the standard brochure
rate." The brochure rate was $5,800 per person, double occupancy, but
she got the cruise for $3,299. The lowest advertised early booking
fare would have been just $1,719.</TE>
<TE>   It was a combination of factors, including the sense that prices
seemed to have hit bottom, that recently prompted me to book my dream
cruise.</TE>
<TE>   I have always wanted to cross the Atlantic aboard the Queen
Elizabeth 2, then jet back aboard the Concorde. A Cunard and British
Airways package offered a 50% discounted cruise fare on the QE 2 from
New York to Southampton, England, combined with a $1,995 charge for
an upgrade return flight on the Concorde.</TE>
<TE>   While not exactly Nordstrom Rack prices, the package was hard to
beat. The five-night cruise costs about $2,500 per person, based on
double occupancy, for a 186-square-foot outside stateroom on the
first deck near the pool (a savings of $700 from the 2001 Cunard
brochure rates' early booking offer). A one-way trip on the Concorde,
London to New York, runs about $6,500.</TE>
<TE>   Like Slominsky, I also went to a travel agent to book my cruise,
and that turned out to be one of the smarter things I did. I had
checked Cunard's Web site, but my travel agent was consistently able
to quote a fare 10% lower than the Web site's for the same category
cabin.</TE>
<TE>   Travel agents are privy to special, "not for publication" deals
and last-minute changes in pricing that the average Joe Traveler
simply cannot get on his own. Don't take advertised fares as the last
word in deals either. Ask about lower fares or cabin upgrades, or
upgrades to business-class seats for those fares that include air
travel.</TE>
<TE>   Also, in speaking with a travel agent, I was quoted a fare that
was 13% lower than the fare a cruise line had advertised just the
week before.</TE>
<TE>   Changed and Changing</TE>
<TE>   Prices clearly have stolen the spotlight lately, but that's not
the only difference in an industry facing new realities--some
promising, some troublesome--that will affect passengers' future.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas, the Tucson cruise agent, thinks the cruise lines made a
"huge mistake" in building so many ships. And, she says, "Sept. 11
made it even worse."</TE>
<TE>   From contract to delivery, the shipbuilding process can take up to
four years, CLIA's Godsman says, and some companies are talking about
deferring future deliveries of new ships.</TE>
<TE>   But "there is a real bullishness in the industry because of the
huge pool of potential cruisers," he says, and the changing
demographics of the cruise passenger--which, according to Lucas,
began to shift in the late '80s--support that.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, passengers are getting younger. In 1986 the average
age was 56; in 2000 it was 50. Such statistics are partly fueling the
projection that the untapped market numbers almost 70 million.</TE>
<TE>   And, as in all segments of the travel industry, the terrorist
attacks have affected cruises, from security to destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, cruise lines have put a "Category 3" security
alert, the highest possible, into place. As they embark, passengers
must show two forms of identification, including a passport or birth
certificate plus a government-issued photo ID.</TE>
<TE>   Hand luggage is screened, and metal detectors and specially
trained canines are being employed by on-board ship security.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the added security on board, the industry has redeployed
many of its ships from such places as the eastern Mediterranean to
destinations the industry perceives as safer, such as Northern Europe
and the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   These "safer" destinations will each see an increase of more than
2% in the number of "bed days" (a measure that means, essentially,
the number of days a bed is available for sale multiplied by the
number of beds) compared with 2001, while the Mediterranean will see
a decrease of 2.5%, Godsman says.</TE>
<TE>   "Until things settle down, we want to fill our ships and make them
more accessible to U.S. and Canadian ports so people can drive," he
adds. "We feel there is a desire to stay close to home."</TE>
<TE>   This means there probably will be more ships in areas that are
closer to home and presumed to be safer for travel.</TE>
<TE>   For an industry that has reported occupancy rates of around 90% in
the past, the added berths could make it more difficult to maintain
high rates, meaning more choices for the consumer and even lower
fares than now.</TE>
<TE>   But as last year showed, no one can really see beyond the horizon.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As if to prove that good things happen to bad people, Dr. Wilhelm
Rolf stood on the deck of the ship, staring out at the sunset. He was
savoring this, his first cruise, enjoying the waters of the Caribbean
as they lapped at the side of the vessel.</LD>
<LD>   Then there were his adoring fans. He was surrounded by them. It
was a sweet feeling.</LD>
<LD>   And it was all because he was evil.</LD>
<TE>   At least his character is. In real life, Will Utay of West
Hollywood portrays Dr. Rolf, "your basic evil but misunderstood
genius" on NBC's soap "Days of Our Lives." Utay was one of six cast
members on a so-called specialty cruise in 1999 who made appearances
in exchange for passage on the Princess Lines cruise ship.</TE>
<TE>   If exotic destinations, fancy meals and nightly entertainment
aren't enough to get you on board a cruise, you can always hobnob
with your favorite soap opera stars. Or you may prefer a voyage with
your fellow philatelists (or stamp collectors, as most of us call
them). Or perhaps you'd like to solve a murder.</TE>
<TE>   There is a specialty cruise for seemingly every market niche: for
gays and lesbians; coin collectors; miniaturists who build
dollhouses; and doctors, dentists and chiropractors, who can earn
continuing education credits right on board.</TE>
<TE>   There is even a cruise for espionage buffs, with former spies,
moles and secret agents from the CIA, FBI and KGB offering daily
seminars on the presumably declassified ins and outs of the spook
business.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of such specialty cruises sail every year. Third parties,
not the cruise lines, usually organize them and, in turn, market the
trips to specialty groups.</TE>
<TE>   Some groups take over entire ships, others a small number of
berths.</TE>
<TE>   Don Fenwick, owner and president of CruiseWorks Inc. in Los
Angeles, organizes specialty cruises for six organizations a year,
who include groups as varied as soap fans to stamp collectors.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing we do is available to the rest of the ship," Fenwick
says.</TE>
<TE>   For the fans of the daily drama, such a cruise promises "autograph
sessions, 'Days' mania games, stage shows, intimate gossip sessions
and parties with the stars," according to a Web site promoting a 1998
cruise.</TE>
<TE>   Although Dr. Rolf/Utay had to sing for his supper by reenacting
scenes from the long-running TV show, he says he didn't mind and that
the fans were friendly and fun.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a terrific vacation," Utay says. "Just being on the ocean
was wonderful, with the spectacular sunrises and sunsets."</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment for the stamp group is in a different vein, Fenwick
says. It includes lectures and discussions on such topics as fakes
and forgeries; and how stamps are made. There are also mini courses
on stamp collecting and a stamp auction.</TE>
<TE>   Jim McAllister's goals in taking his first all-gay Windjammer
Barefoot cruise six years ago were social. McAllister, an Austin,
Texas-based sales manager, hoped to meet new people.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an alternative to the big cruise lines," McAllister says of
the relaxed, informal sailing ships operated by Windjammer,
"especially for a single gay man who wants to meet others in a
nonthreatening atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Since that first trip, McAllister has been aboard Windjammer's
Barefoot cruises twice. The friendships he has forged draw him back.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, he says, "It's one of the best bargains I've ever found."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a sampling of some upcoming specialty cruises. For more
information, check cruise lines' Web sites or contact a group or
organization with which you are affiliated.</TE>
<TE>   * CruiseWorks has organized a 10-day Panama Canal murder-mystery
cruise departing April 15 aboard Princess Cruise Lines' Sun Princess.

<HD>Finding the Lowest Prices on the High Seas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's how the experts recommend you find the best deals and protect
your vacation investment:</LD>
<LD>   * Sooner is usually better. Prices have already begun to rebound
slightly from the lows of last fall. For example, a three-day Baja
Mexico cruise on Carnival was advertised recently for $329 but was
touted just after Sept. 11 for $249. Furthermore, some of the recent
advertised prices are good only until Feb. 14.</LD>
<LD>   * Keep an eye on fares after you book. Ask your travel agent if
the line you're booking on has price protection guarantees in case
the fare drops. Call your agent a month before you cruise to see if
you are owed a refund.</LD>
<TE>   * Check for gateway-specific promotions. Sometimes a line will
offer a special deal from certain markets to bolster travel from that
area.</TE>
<TE>   * If you have taken a cruise before, ask about promotions for
repeat customers. Sometimes returnees are offered two-for-one fares,
a discount on regular fares and other inducements.</TE>
<TE>   * Early bookings and deposits can earn on-board credit. I earned a
$75-per-person credit for making a deposit on a trip on the QE2. It's
scheduled for May, but I booked last month. Such rewards can vary
from $50 to $200, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   * Check into premium and luxury lines that often do not emphasize
pricing in their advertising. You may be able to cruise on a ship
with better amenities for the price of one of the less upscale lines.</TE>
<TE>   * Be flexible. If you have some give on travel dates and the
destination you are interested in, you might find a better deal. You
may find that trips in "shoulder season" or on repositioning cruises
offer more bang for your sailing buck.</TE>
<TE>   * Gather information online. The more knowledge you have going in,
the better decision you will make. The major cruise lines have Web
sites, and you will find specialty sites such as www.cruises.com.</TE>
<TE>   Check the reviews section. I found a $399 fare for a seven-night
Caribbean cruise aboard Norwegian Cruise Lines' Norway, which has
been in service since 1961. The average review (out of 61 done by
passengers) was three stars (out of five).</TE>
<TE>   Is it worth it? Only you can decide, but at least you can make an
informed decision about whether the bargain outweighs other factors.</TE>
<TE>   * Use a travel agent. Commissions remain high for cruises,
motivating agents to work hard for your business. They also may know
about deals that you cannot access. And many can use their clout to
get you upgrades or other perks.</TE>

<HD>Do-It-Yourself Skippers in Burgundy</HD>
<DH>Learning the ropes on a canal boat in France, with scenic
days--and endless locks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>DECIZE, France</DL>
<LD>Folks, you have read about barge cruises on the Rhine or the Danube
or through Provence, on those hotel boats with luxurious cabins and a
chef. Or the deluxe charters serving foie gras accompanied by a noble
Chablis.</LD>
<LD>   This wasn't that.</LD>
<LD>   This was a self-skippered cruise on Burgundy's Nivernais Canal. We
paid our money (about $2,000) and got a motor-driven houseboat, some
instructions, a map and a guidebook.</LD>
<TE>   No license required. No experience necessary.</TE>
<TE>   For seven nights we lived and slept on the 32-foot Tamaris. I did
most of the driving because I was the Captain. The Wife, bless her,
did most of the actual work and mainly complained only when I threw
loose piles of wet rope at her instead of a neat coil.</TE>
<TE>   "Toss it, like you're roping a steer," she shouted from shore,
untangling herself from the mess. "I thought you were a cowboy."</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be a cowboy," I shouted back. "But I couldn't figure
out the rope."</TE>
<TE>   We had looked forward to seven days lazily floating along on a
canal, passing chateaux and quaint villages. We thought we would
visit a local market once or twice and, using regional produce,
create our own French banquet.</TE>
<TE>   Canned ravioli. One night's dinner was canned ravioli.</TE>
<TE>   Here we go.</TE>
<TE>   Day 1</TE>
<TE>   We met our boat in Tannay, a pleasant town about 125 miles
southeast of Paris on the Canal du Nivernais. She was a looker,
Tamaris. A proud vessel of Crown Blue Line. Sparkling white with blue
trim. Her styling was trophy yacht, but her heart was pure houseboat.</TE>
<TE>   If you've ever been inside a midsize recreational vehicle, add a
second tiny bedroom and a second tiny bathroom and you've been inside
the Tamaris. Gas oven and stove. Mini-fridge. Sitting/dining area.
That's about it.</TE>
<TE>   George, from Crown, took us through. He showed us the controls. He
showed us where to check the oil and where to check for
engine-clogging balls of canal grass.</TE>
<TE>   He showed the Wife how to tie a clove hitch, a knot designed to
keep the boat from floating overnight to Belgium. He showed us where
to fill the freshwater tanks.</TE>
<TE>   He took us for a short spin around the harbor and let me drive
(seemed easy enough). And then he steered us back to the dock.</TE>
<TE>   George told us a little bit about the locks. He told us not to
worry--lock keepers would be on duty. And then he gave me the keys.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very cool," said the Wife. "I'm scared to death."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's take her for a little test drive," the Captain said.</TE>
<TE>   The canal at Tannay flows under a charming stone bridge. While
trying to guide Tamaris under the bridge, I learned the boat doesn't
like to go straight.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop!" screamed the Wife.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think I'll ever forget the sound of a 32-foot houseboat
slamming against the inside wall of a charming stone bridge.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep it centered! Keep it centered! You're doing it again!"</TE>
<TE>   Blam. Nailed it good.</TE>
<TE>   We made it back. The Wife tied the boat, which was shaken but
uninjured, to the moorings. The clove hitch eluded her. "It looks
right, but it's not securing...."</TE>
<TE>   That evening, during dinner in the modest Hotel du Morvan in
Tannay, as I studied a map of the Nivernais Canal, the Wife practiced
clove hitches with a napkin.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm scared," the Wife said.</TE>
<TE>   Sleep aboard the Tamaris did not come easily.</TE>
<TE>   Day 2</TE>
<TE>   We didn't wake up in Belgium. And it was a beautiful morning.
John, a canal veteran from South Africa whose boat was parked nearby,
stopped by with advice.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't put the boat in the center and expect it to stay," he
said. "It tends to slide. It's nearly a flat bottom, so there's
nothing to hold it centered. You just try to aim the nose toward the
center."</TE>
<TE>   The Wife, meanwhile, was playing with knots, coached by a neighbor
who spoke only Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   And we were off.</TE>
<TE>   The canal, just wide enough for two boats to pass comfortably, was
lovely. Birds chirped from the trees alongside. White cattle,
Charolais, munched in pastures on either side. Century-old farmhouses
dotted the hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   The Tamaris handled like a rear-wheel-drive car with bald tires on
a sheet of ice. Top speed was 5 mph. That's Pirates of the Caribbean
speed--which was good, because it was only a few minutes before we
encountered the first lock.</TE>
<TE>   Locks enable boats to go uphill on water. And downhill. Here's
how: A boat enters an open chute. A lock keeper closes a gate behind
the boat, sealing the chute, then sends water surging into the chute
by lowering a barrier; this water fills the chute and floats the boat
to a new level. The lock keeper opens a front gate, and the boat
drives on.</TE>
<TE>   On the Nivernais, some of the mechanisms are as old as the canal,
which opened in 1844. All those gates and chutes are operated by a
man or a woman--some of whom also are seemingly as old as the canal.
These men and women are the lock keepers. Sometimes they need help.
Which will bring us back to the Wife.</TE>
<TE>   My job as the Captain was to drive the boat into the chute. The
Wife's job was to climb up a wet, slippery steel ladder to the top of
the lock, catch a wet rope tossed by me, wrap the rope around a
mooring post, then toss the loose end of the rope back to me in the
boat, which I held while taking pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The Wife then helped the lock keepers turn a manual crank, which
wasn't easy. On our 60-mile cruise, we would face 72 locks.</TE>
<TE>   It's good to be Captain.</TE>
<TE>   Around noon and after three locks, we'd found our first village:
Monceaux-le-Comte. A small grocery supplied us with local sausage and
cheese. Our first boat picnic. Just like in the brochures.</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon we arrived in a small harbor that served the town
of Corbigny, two miles above the canal. This time the Wife's clove
hitches hitched.</TE>
<TE>   We rode bikes into Corbigny, past sheep and cows and picture-book
French countryside made soft by the twilight. Dinner in Corbigny was
wonderful. And when we returned to the harbor, a dozen boats had
joined ours, their interior lights making them look like floating
lanterns.</TE>
<TE>   We slept soundly.</TE>
<TE>   Day 3</TE>
<TE>   We headed off, newly confident. Destination: Baye, which books
said had a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Then it rained.</TE>
<TE>   We reached a lock that had no keeper. We waited on the water,
engine idling, hoping someone would show. Nobody showed.</TE>
<TE>   I grounded the Tamaris against the grassy bank. The Wife, feeling
a break in the weather, hopped off to search for anyone who resembled
a lock keeper. Then the storm really hit. Thunder, lightning.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty minutes later, soaked and without a lock keeper, the Wife
stepped back aboard the Tamaris.</TE>
<TE>   A lock keeper, curiously dry, finally did arrive after we had
improvised a lunch of leftovers. The sun poked through. Again we were
on our way. Again it began to rain. Hard. One lock after another, the
Wife climbed up those slick metal ladders, did the rope thing, helped
the lock keeper crank.</TE>
<TE>   We weren't going to make Baye. Not even close. At a widening in
the canal we glided to shore, hammered stakes into the ground and
secured the Tamaris for the night. Our last lock keeper, a lovely
woman named Marie-Noel, had sensed our situation and drove up to us
in her car.</TE>
<TE>   There was a town, she said, a few miles off the canal. Even on a
Sunday evening, the tiny grocery in Sardy-les-Epiry might have
something on its shelves. I went along.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner in France, the culinary capital of the world: a can of beef
ravioli and packaged breadsticks.</TE>
<TE>   Day 4</TE>
<TE>   The air that greeted us as we tentatively emerged was fresh and
fragrant, the deep green of the surrounding forest stunning, the
water still. I looked over at this woman I like a lot.</TE>
<TE>   "Does it get any better than this?"</TE>
<TE>   "Don't go there," the Wife said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet again we eased out onto the Nivernais Canal. Ahead of us
loomed a quick succession of 16 locks. Sixteen wet ladders etc.</TE>
<TE>   But two good things happened.</TE>
<TE>   First, the sun came out.</TE>
<TE>   Second, we got the hang of this. On one stretch, we did six locks
in 78 minutes. Trust me: We were cookin'.</TE>
<TE>   The Wife had figured it out. Instead of climbing out of the boat
at every stop, she grabbed a bike and pedaled ahead to the next lock.
I'd drive into the lock, steady the boat and toss the rope up to her.
Neatly coiled. She would toss the free end, help the lock keeper,
then bike ahead to the next lock.</TE>
<TE>   We were beautiful. Well, the Wife was beautiful. I just drove the
boat.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from a tunnel at La Collancelle, we reached Baye at
lunchtime. Other self-skippered boats were parked with us. There is a
sense of community among people who do canals. It is like the feeling
at RV campgrounds, where strangers aren't strangers for long.</TE>
<TE>   Soon we were in Chatillon-en-Bazois. Ducks in the canal scurried
for tossed bits of bread. A magnificent garden framed a grand chateau
mirrored in the Nivernais. Behind us, steps from where the Tamaris
rested in the harbor, was the town itself, looking as if centuries
had made little change.</TE>
<TE>   "This," the Wife said, "is what I was expecting."</TE>
<TE>   Day 5</TE>
<TE>   Absolutely sparkling. Gorgeous. Everything was: the chateau and
its garden, the village, the canal, the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The locks can handle as many as three boats at once, and after
Baye we often shared the chute with two others. The skipper of one
was a Frenchman named Paul, who spent most of his time in San
Francisco. "This is as rural as France gets," said Paul, enjoying a
homecoming. "That's why I picked it."</TE>
<TE>   Then came the flies.</TE>
<TE>   Pastures are beautiful things, especially with handsome livestock.
Charolais, those white cows, are handsome livestock. The problem is
that Charolais, like other large creatures, generate large amounts of
byproduct. And byproduct generates flies.</TE>
<TE>   We chose a spot to stop for the night--a bank of the canal near a
quiet farm town called Isenay--and rode our bikes to take a look.
From the village's one churchyard, we could see much of the valley,
and the low sun had turned the hills to velvet and the canal to a
deep green ribbon.</TE>
<TE>   That night offered a chance at last for the Captain to create a
great meal: spaghetti topped with canned sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Day 6</TE>
<TE>   The canal steamed in the light of first dawn. We would reach our
next destination, the town of Cercy-la-Tour, before lunch. Just in
time for the funeral. My primitive French had determined that the
entire village had gathered in a church in the center of the town.
Flowers were everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a boy, 16," a woman told me later. "He was on his scooter
and was hit by a car."</TE>
<TE>   It occurred to me that the impact of one boy's death on a town
like this was incalculable.</TE>
<TE>   Day 7</TE>
<TE>   The Nivernais was losing its rural charm. The slow pace was more
annoying now that industry had encroached on the scenery.</TE>
<TE>   The final lock, No. 72, was ahead. Following that: the Loire.</TE>
<TE>   The Loire has a current, and crisscross wakes made the Tamaris bob
and the kitchenware rattle. Our job was to maneuver to Decize without
being rammed by working barges carrying enough coal to light
Normandy.</TE>
<TE>   At 2:30 on the afternoon of the seventh day, I eased the boat to
the dock at Decize. The Wife leaped onto the concrete bank and, using
perfectly executed clove hitches, tied onto the mooring posts.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we did it," I said. "And we're still married."</TE>
<TE>   The Wife, retying the forward line to keep the bow from drifting
into the river, looked up briefly, then pulled the bow toward her.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," I said, "when we get back to Paris, let's take one of
those sightseeing rides on the Seine."</TE>
<TE>   The Wife stood, the loose end of the line in both hands, the bow
fighting her like the great fish of Hemingway's Old Man, and looked
straight at me.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't really want to get on another boat."</TE>
<TE>   (I did. She went. That's why she's the Wife.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

for travel through March 20 (must be ticketed by Feb. 28). Other
airlines start at $646.</TE>
<TE>   Where to go: France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium,
Scotland and Ireland are popular for nice scenery, good facilities
(docking areas, freshwater spigots) and waterways that beginners can
navigate.</TE>
<TE>   Locks and bridges: Some lock keepers do all the work; others
appreciate help. At some spots you're on your own. It doesn't take
superior intellect to figure out the locks, but it helps if one
passenger has a little dexterity and upper-body strength.</TE>
<TE>   The boats: Our boat, the Tamaris, had two cabins and two
bathrooms. It was listed as sleeping "4+2"--two people in each of the
two snug cabins, plus two people in the boat's sitting area. Four
adults and two kids would have been OK; six adults would have been
too cramped. Weekly rates range from $1,565 (early spring or late
fall) to $2,240 (midsummer).</TE>
<TE>   Bigger boats may provide more space but don't improve the quality
of the ride. Smaller boats have more docking options. A good travel
agent can set up an itinerary for you; I used Abercrombie &amp; Kent,
(800) 323-7308. Or you can contact charter companies directly.</TE>
<TE>   We used Crown Blue Line,</TE>

355-9491 or (201) 569-9588, fax (201) 569-6038,

<TE>   Expenses: Fuel, drop-off charges for one-way itineraries and other
fees may cost extra. Expect for transportation to and from the boat,
groceries and other supplies not to be included. We paid $45.95 to
rent two bikes for the week. Village docks may charge for overnight
mooring. It's customary to give modest tips to lock keepers.</TE>

<HD>Bargains Still Afloat in Cruise World</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The weeklong cruise selling for $299 is gone. It appeared soon after
Sept. 11 and lasted a few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   But that doesn't mean you can't find bargains and incentives. Here
are some examples:</LD>
<LD>   * Panama for pennies: One of Cunard Lines' most elegant ships is
marked down on its Panama Canal sailings this spring. "And don't be
fooled by the price," says Rick White, owner of White Travel Service
in West Hartford, Conn., (800) 547-4790. "This is an ultra-deluxe
ship." He's referring to the Caronia (formerly the Vistafjord), a
700-passenger beauty for which White Travel has slashed rates to $66
per day. In all, a 12-night Panama Canal cruise, departing March 24
or April 18 from Acapulco, will cost $799 per person (double
occupancy) for the best available inside room, plus about $189 in
port charges and taxes. The Caronia is known for its fine cuisine,
comfortably sized staterooms and Jeeves-quality service (for which
there's a 2-to-1 passenger-to-crew ratio).</LD>
<TE>   The Caronia will be sailing from Acapulco to Puerto Quetzal,
Guatemala, and Puntarenas, Costa Rica, before making a full transit
of the Panama Canal. It will then visit the San Blas Islands, San
Andres Island, Montego Bay and Great Bahama Bank before ending in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. On March 11 and April 5, the reverse itinerary
(requiring an extra night) is available for $100 more, and the ship
will also visit Zihuatanejo or Ixtapa in Mexico. White Travel is
again the source for these prices.</TE>
<TE>   * Pleasures on Princess: Princess Cruise Lines will introduce the
2,500-berth Star Princess to the Los Angeles area later this spring.
To make room for it, the smaller Sea Princess has been bumped from
its seven-night schedule to a 10-night sailing rotation. GalaxSea
Cruises and Tours, (800) 662-5450 or www.cruisestar.com, is there to
fill the gap. It is offering the new 11-night Mexico itineraries
(which go round trip from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas, Acapulco,
Zihuatanejo, Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan) for $709, plus port
charges and taxes of $120.</TE>
<TE>   * Intelligent Alaska: For passengers who want to learn all they
can about Alaska, World Explorer Cruises is a superb choice. Several
noted experts--college professors, biologists, authors and the
like--are aboard each of its sailings to give shipboard lectures and
lead shore excursions. These programs are combined with hands-on
workshops led by Alaskan artisans, evenings of cabaret and classical
music and daily meals that focus on Alaskan ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   World Explorer will also please vacationers with its prices this
year. For early- and late-season cruising (May 5 and 14 and Aug. 6),
it will offer half off companion fares. Thus, the first passenger
will pay between $1,525 and $1,995 for a nine- or 14-night cruise,
the second person half that. That results in rates between $106 and
$127 per person, per day, including those annoying port charges and
taxes (as well as free parking in Vancouver for those who decide to
drive to the dock).</TE>
<TE>   In another offer not often found in the cruise world, World
Explorer Cruises will waive single-room supplements for a limited
number of category D, E, F and G cabins for all of its sailings.
These are all double-berthed cabins, which essentially will be going
for the price of one bed. This means that singles will pay less on
World Explorer, even at the height of the season, than they will on
other cruise lines (where the single supplement can often increase
the cost of cruising by nearly half). To learn more, call World
Explorer at (800) 854-3835 or www.wecruise.com.</TE>
<TE>   * The brave at sea: The men and women who risk their lives
fighting fires, aiding the sick and keeping the peace have been
showered with praise and a number of freebies ever since that
dreadful day in September. The latest "thank you" comes from White
Travel Service and MSC Italian Cruises in the form of free cruises to
police officers, firefighters and EMTs, both current and retired, for
sailings through mid-March. Officers must be accompanied by one
paying adult and show a copy of a badge or an ID card.</TE>
<TE>   The company's flagship, the Melody, will sail to the Caribbean and
the Panama Canal on several 11-night itineraries. There are still
cabins available for the Feb. 26, March 9 and March 20 cruises. Rates
for the paying passenger start at $699 for the full 11-night vacation
(plus port charges of $179; these are waived for the "hero"). To
learn more, call White Travel Service at (800) 547-4790.</TE>
<TE>   * An evergreen: How could one conduct a cruise roundup without
mentioning the Norway, that perennial price slasher? This older ship
elicits praise from readers for its likable crew, nice itineraries
and absence of rock-climbing walls, giant atriums and Las Vegas-style
revues. The price will start at $449 per person ($599 in an outside
cabin) for seven nights, for those who book through My Travel Co.,
(800) 732-7283, www.mytravelco.com, among other discounters. That's
the rate for the April 14 sailing, and it includes port charges
(although not taxes). The itinerary? From Miami to St. Maarten, St.
John and St. Thomas, stopping for one day and night at a private
island called Great Stirrup Cay. Passengers debark in Miami.</TE>

<HD>Seafaring Experience Unfurls at a Good Clip on Largest
Sailing Ship</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blinking sleep from his eyes, a tall, dark-haired man in his mid-30s
stumbled over the high threshold that led to the open decks, then
glanced at the majestic display of unfurled white sails swelling
above him, five masts of 42 sails measuring 5,980 square yards. He
gasped, and his face lighted up like a child looking at a Christmas
tree.</LD>
<LD>   He was aboard the world's largest sailing ship, the 228-passenger
Royal Clipper from Star Clippers, and he seemed enthralled by its
sails. He spent most of every day on deck watching the crew set the
sails, or he clambered into the mesh webbing on the bowsprit to watch
the sails fill with wind. And he was always in the front row when
Capt. Jurgen Muller-Cyran, who has also served aboard the historic
four-masted sailing ship Sea Cloud, gave lectures on navigation and
seamanship.</LD>
<TE>   The Royal Clipper can be a terrific vacation for the right
people--sailing fans, romantics, families with kids older than 6,
stressed-out working couples who want to spend a week wearing shorts
and deck shoes and then go ashore in exotic tropical ports for a
seafood lunch or dinner. Fussy cruise veterans looking for an
ultra-luxury cruise with fine dining, chilled champagne, elegant
evenings and flawless service should search elsewhere. Although Star
Clippers offers a much more polished sailing experience than the
stalwart tall ships of Windjammer Barefoot Cruises or the Maine
Windjammer Assn. ships, it is not a cruise vacation but rather a
sailing trip aboard a glamorous, almost glitzy new vessel.</TE>
<TE>   The ship's three-deck atrium begins in a sunken area in the center
of the dining room, where buffet tables are spread. The second level
overlooks the buffet from a circular gallery framed with wrought-iron
railings, while on the third level more wrought-iron railings, a
piano bar and richly upholstered sofas and chairs are set around the
atrium. Overhead is a glass-bottomed swimming pool that allows
dappled light to play on the surfaces below. Swimmers in the pool are
also on view, at least the parts of them that are underwater.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the social activity takes place at the Tropical Bar on the
open deck, which is also inhabited by a parrot.</TE>
<TE>   A cozy library furnished with leather sofas, a fireplace (with an
electric simulated fire) and a sparse collection of reading material
was the preferred hangout for cell-phone users during our trip in
August. At the opposite end of the deck is an observation lounge,
which doubles as a lecture room.</TE>
<TE>   Dress on board is casual, but many passengers donned resort-style
silks and linens in the evening. Smoking is not permitted in the
cabins, so the open deck, the piano bar and the smoking side of the
dining room can get polluted. On our cruise a table of French
passengers smoked so much one night during dinner that they set off
the smoke alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Cabins are small; the word "shipshape" comes to mind. Besides a
bed, there is a kneehole desk with a stool, a small nightstand with
three drawers, a dresser with three drawers, one chair and an
attractive bathroom with black and white marble tile floors and a
shower. When booking, specify whether you want a double bed or twins,
because many of the beds cannot be converted from one to the other.
The wardrobe area is sparse, with no full-length hanging space; our
closet had only nine hangers for two of us.</TE>
<TE>   Because there is no elevator on board and because the gangway is
long and steep, doorsills are extra high and some ports of call are
accessible only by tender (a small boat boarded from the gangway
while the ship is at anchor), so we would not recommend the Royal
Clipper to anyone with impaired mobility.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment was simple: a pleasant pair of retired Irish
schoolteachers who sang and played on deck at cocktail time and after
dinner in the piano bar. Occasionally our cruise director, nicknamed
Attila the Hungarian (Attila Denes from Budapest), led a dance
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Although the ship is dazzling, the food preparation and service
seem to get less than full attention, despite lavish buffet spreads
and menus that read enticingly. This could be partly because basic
supplies often seemed less than prime quality. Tomatoes were rock
hard and often white or green inside, although we were cruising off
France and Italy in August, when street markets were full of juicy,
ripe fruits and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Supplementing the seafood buffets were innumerable dishes of small
stewed chickens. At breakfast, the fresh fruit consisted of large
chunks of unripe pears, peaches and nectarines heaped on plates, and
at lunchtime, vast displays of desserts based on gelatin, cakes and
cream puddings were set out with nary a bowl of berries or
fresh-baked cookies in sight. On the plus side, the lunch buffets
always offered a salad bar and a platter of cheese. Except for the
first night out, dinner was served course by course at the table.</TE>
<TE>   In summer the Royal Clipper sails the western Mediterranean and in
winter the Caribbean, departing from Barbados on Saturdays until
April 20. Itineraries alternate, with Windward Island ports
(Martinique, Iles des Saintes, Antigua, St. Kitts, Dominica and St.
Lucia) one week and Grenadine Island ports (Martinique, St. Lucia,
Bequia, St. Vincent, Tobago Cays and Grenada, plus the captain's
choice of one of the Grenadine Islands) the following week.
Passengers who would like to sail for two contiguous weeks get a $300
discount on the second cruise.</TE>
<TE>   Brochure fares start at $1,445 per person, double occupancy, plus
$155 port charges, for a small inside cabin. A slightly larger
outside cabin in a mid-category starts at $1,915, a smallish suite at
$3,465 per person, double occupancy. A child sharing a cabin with two
adults sails for $445 for the week; 27 of the cabins offer a third
berth.</TE>
<TE>   To get a free brochure for Star Clippers, ask a travel agent, call
(800) 442-0551 or log on to the company's Web site at
www.starclippers.com.</TE>

<LD>When a woman's place is on the road, these new products ease the
going. Many may be available in area stores. Prices do not include
shipping.</LD>
<LD>   Vested interest: Mountain Hardware makes classy, well-tailored
outdoor wear. Polartec makes lightweight, wind-resistant fleece
fabric. Pair the two and you get stylish garments that keep you warm
without weighing you down. One of the most attractive new
collaborations is the women's Ozone Vest. The zippered sleeveless
jacket has a contoured fit, a high collar, two zippered pockets and a
draw cord at the hem and back collar for extra insulation. Makes a
nice layer under ski jackets, or wear it over a T-shirt for nippy
nights in warmer climes.</LD>
<LD>   Mountain Hardware Women's Ozone Vest in black, periwinkle or slate
is $95. Information: (800) 953-8375, www.mountainhardware.com.</LD>
<TE>   Image maker: Wouldn't it be nice to travel with makeup and jewelry
in one easily accessible place, with a mirror handy for putting it on
wherever you happen to be? That's the idea behind Travelon's Portable
Mirrored Vanity. Unfold the 11- by 9- by 3-inch-thick nylon case, and
you'll find a flip-up 6-inch-square unbreakable mirror, elasticized
loops to hold lipsticks, makeup pencils and brushes and, on each
side, spacious zippered compartments for perfume, jewelry or even a
small paperback book.</TE>
<TE>   Each side compartment has plastic-lined zippered pockets to keep
things organized. When closed, the case is secured with Velcro
strips. It has an outside zippered pocket and sewn-in carry handle.</TE>
<TE>   Travelon's Portable Mirrored Vanity in red or black is $34.95 at
luggage stores. Information: (800) 537-5544, www.travelonbags.com.</TE>
<TE>   A shoe-in: Tumi's travel bags show an attention to detail more
commonly found in designer clothes. With their trademark leather
trim, black-striped linings and plethora of pockets, these bags
aren't cheap, but they are as useful as they are attractive. This
season the manufacturer has gotten playful with its line of women's
bags, making many of them in wild-cherry hues. A particular winner is
a small duffel with a separate zippered shoe compartment at the
bottom.</TE>
<TE>   The main section, made of rugged ballistic nylon, has four
interior pockets. The rigid-frame leather shoe compartment has one
interior pocket. Both compartments have double zippers that can be
locked. (Two small combination locks are included with the bag.) The
17-by-141/2-by-91/2-inch bag has a zippered exterior pocket, leather
handles and a detachable shoulder strap.</TE>
<TE>   Tumi Small Duffel with Shoe Compartment (Style 43066) is $450.
Information: (800) 322-8864, www.tumi.com.</TE>
<TE>   Bitty slicker: No need to debate whether to use precious luggage
space for a bulky (but possibly necessary) raincoat. This waterproof
microfiber coat provides plenty of protection but packs into its own
11-inch-square pouch. The buttoned coat has a hood zippered into the
back collar and a draw cord at the waist for a more tapered look. The
pouch has its own zippered pocket and a sewn-in shoulder strap,
making it a useful little tote on its own. A lightweight zip-on
nylon/polyester liner (sold separately) adds extra warmth.</TE>
<TE>   Packable Microfiber Classic Raincoat in olive, black, red or sand
(Item 5744) is $189; liner (5268) is $59.50, from TravelSmith; (800)
950-1600, www.travelsmith.com.</TE>
<TE>   Fragrant dreams: Aromatherapy may not heal what ails you, but the
botanical blends used in the body treatments certainly can be
pleasant to the senses. Essence of Vali, a manufacturer of herbal
massage and bath oils, has introduced a nighttime potion called
Sleep, meant to reduce stress and calm the user into peaceful
slumber.</TE>
<TE>   Just sprinkle the oil-based mix of lavender, cedar, marjoram and
ylang-ylang onto the pillowcase and think tranquil thoughts. Sleep
comes in a tiny cobalt blue bottle with a velveteen pouch. Unless
you're allergic to the ingredients, consider the pleasant-smelling
balm like chicken soup--it couldn't hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Essence of Vali Sleep Botanical Blend is $18 for a 5-ml. bottle.

<HD>Summit of Mt. Diablo Tempts With Devilishly Panoramic Views</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bay Area's Mt. Diablo is one of California's most prominent
peaks. No other significant mountains block the view, so summit
panoramas are among the continent's best, stretching from the Golden
Gate Bridge to the High Sierra. Rangers at Mt. Diablo State Park say
hikers can see more of Earth's surface from here than from any other
peak in North America.</LD>
<LD>   The mighty 3,849-foot mountain has subtler appeal too, a quiet
beauty that brings hikers back again and again to explore the park's
100 miles of trails.</LD>
<LD>   In spring, meadows blossom with buttercups and blue-eyed grass.
Other common blooms include Indian paintbrush, clarkia, larkspur and
California fuchsia. A keen-eyed wildflower lover might even spot the
rare Mt. Diablo globe lily, a squat yellow flower with a
lantern-shaped blossom; it grows only on and around the mountain.</LD>
<TE>   The loop hike along Back Creek and Mitchell Canyon trails is a
favorite of mine because it's a fine tour of the mountain's diverse
ecology. The two trails are in canyons that are quite different and
allow hikers to explore distinct landscapes: grasslands, chaparral
slopes, riparian communities and more. Alder and big-leaf maple grow
along Mitchell Creek, beautiful drifts of blue oak and live oak
thrive on savannas and gray pine clings to upper slopes.</TE>
<TE>   You can begin a hike from the bottom of either canyon; each trail
head has its advantages. Mitchell Canyon might seem the obvious
choice because it has restrooms, a visitor center, picnic tables and
a large parking lot. The drawback: It doesn't open until 8 a.m., a
disadvantage for bird-watchers who might want to start the day as
Mitchell Canyon's many feathered residents rise.</TE>
<TE>   The hike I'm describing starts at the Back Creek trail head, at
the edge of suburbia. It has no facilities but is always open.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: For the Mitchell Canyon trail head
and visitor center, take Interstate 680 to Walnut Creek and exit onto
Ygnacio Valley Road. Drive east 71/2 miles. Turn right (south) onto
Clayton Road and drive one mile. At Mitchell Canyon Road, turn right
and continue until the road ends at the state park day-use parking
area.</TE>
<TE>   For this week's hike, start at the Back Creek trail head. Take
Interstate 680 to Walnut Creek and exit onto Ygnacio Valley Road.
Drive east 71/2 miles. Turn right (south) on Clayton Road and drive
three miles. Turn right on Regency Drive and go half a mile to its
end.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: From the end of Regency Drive, descend an embankment and
follow a dirt road to a signed connector trail. This path leads west
to Back Creek Trail. At a signed junction, go left (south) onto a
fire road heading into the canyon past oak and gray pine.</TE>
<TE>   The trail steepens, the canyon walls narrow and the trail leads up
a corridor of sage, toyon and yarrow. Hikers climb past thickets of
manzanita and yerba santa. About three miles into the trek, the path
bends east, then north. It meets a fire road at Marchio Gap.</TE>
<TE>   Summit-bound climbers will go left onto a fire road. You, however,
want to make a loop, descending three-quarters of a mile to Deer
Flat--not flat at all but a great place to watch wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   At a signed junction, join Mitchell Canyon Trail for a mile-long,
moderately steep descent. The fire road, which parallels Mitchell
Creek, flattens as you pass through a mixed woodland. Hikers
frequently spot coyotes in the lower reaches of the canyon.</TE>
<TE>   At trail's end near the Mitchell Canyon Interpretive Center and
ranger station, you'll join a connector trail that briefly parallels
Mitchell Canyon Road and leads to a junction with an unsigned path
running east-west. Skip the paths leading north toward a residential
neighborhood; you want to walk east across the grasslands to a signed
junction with Back Creek Trail, which you can follow back north to
Regency Drive.</TE>

<KH>Taking the Kids</KH>
<HD>See What Those City Lights Can Do to Brighten Up a Family
Weekend</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Enough nesting! Get off the couch! Turn off the TV and the computer.
Grab the kids and head for the city lights.</LD>
<LD>   Wherever you live, there's nothing like a winter weekend to
explore museums, historic sites, zoos, aquariums, shops and theaters.</LD>
<LD>   Here's your chance to do something different with the kids and get
a new perspective on a city you may already know well. Maybe they can
hone their table manners by having tea in a fancy hotel or expand
their taste buds at inexpensive ethnic eateries.</LD>
<TE>   To make sure the kids buy into the idea, let them have some input
in the itinerary, even if you're just planning one day in the city.
Borrow a guidebook from the library to get some ideas, or join the
kids at the computer to browse your favorite city's official Web
site. Family travel sites such as the Family Travel Forum
(www.familytravelforum.com), Travel With Kids
(travelwithkids.about.com) or the family area at Expedia.com also can
be great resources on where to go and where to find deals.</TE>
<TE>   Science lovers should turn to www.tryscience.org, a Web site from
the Assn. of Science-Technology Centers and cooperating
organizations, to find out what's going on at science museums around
the country.</TE>
<TE>   If you have some budding actors, check out www.broadway.org, the
Web site for the League of American Theatres and Producers, where you
can find ticket deals for Broadway productions and touring companies.
If you are heading to New York, the Web site lets you access coupons
good for discounts on many Broadway productions, from "Beauty and the
Beast" to "Cabaret," with some tickets less than $50. Ask about
special family theater promotions. You can also call (800) I-LOVENY
(456-8369).</TE>
<TE>   New York isn't the only city that hopes to tempt your family to
visit this winter. Snare a cheap fare to London and let your Harry
Potter fan seek out wizards, witches and ghosts on the new Harry
Potter tour of Britain. Of course, the tour includes locations in the
film--from historic Gloucester Cathedral (students at the school were
extras) to the Bodleian Library at Oxford (used to re-create some of
the interior scenes at Hogwarts). For a free copy of the tour map,
call (866) 4-HEDWIG (443-3944) or visit www.travelbritain.org.</TE>
<TE>   Follow the chocolate smells to Chicago's Field Museum, where an
exhibit opening on Valentine's Day will teach the kids everything
they ever wanted to know about chocolate, from how it's made to its
history. (How does fried, chocolate-dipped liver grab you? The 18th
century Italians liked it.) There are free samples, of course. Call
(312) 922-9410 or visit www.fieldmuseum.org.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrate "Chicago Winter Delights" with weekly Saturday-evening
fireworks, downtown hotel rooms starting at $69 a night and
restaurants touting meals for $20.02. Call (877) CHICAGO (244-2246)
or visit www.877chicago.com.</TE>
<TE>   History buffs (and those who could use a little help with their
history lessons) can follow the Freedom Trail in Boston, where a new
"Boston USA Specials" card affords myriad discounts on hotels, meals,
shopping, sightseeing tours and more. Here's your chance to teach
your 12-year-old how to crack a lobster. The card is available free
online at www.bostonUSA.com or by calling (888) 733-2678.</TE>
<TE>   Stoke the family's patriotism by heading to Washington, D.C.
Guided tours of the Capitol Building have resumed, and many hotels
are offering rooms well below $100 a night. Perhaps the best thing
about a winter visit is that you won't have to fight the summer
crowds at the Smithsonian or the Washington Monument. Visit
www.washington.org.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't want to venture too far from home, you can drive to a
nearby city--or introduce the kids to the joys of train travel.
Ridership is at an all-time high, according to Amtrak, with 23.5
million riders in the last year. From now until Feb. 21 (for travel
through Feb. 28), buy one ticket and get one free on most routes,
including the Acela regional service between Washington, D.C., and
Boston; the Coast Starlight from Los Angeles to Seattle; and the
California Zephyr from San Francisco to Chicago. Remember that on
Amtrak, kids ages 2 to 15 ride for half-price, and seniors (read:
grandparents) get 15% off. Call (800) USA-RAIL (872-7245) and mention
promotion code H207, or visit www.amtrak.com.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever you go this winter, you shouldn't have to pay full price.
Make it a family project to see how many discounts you can collect
and use on one trip--restaurants, museums, attractions and, of
course, hotels. Can kids get in free? Is breakfast included? Any
extra discounts on purchases? You'll be surprised how much you can
save just by not being shy about asking.</TE>

<HD>More Than Just Carsick Near Cairns</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Wonders Down Under," by Jerry V. Haines (Jan. 20): Haines
is lucky that he only got carsick on his outing to the Great Barrier
Reef.</LD>
<LD>   On our trip last year aboard a catamaran operated by Quicksilver
Connections, we wound up on choppy seas two hours from the mainland
with inadequate warning. The ship and the pontoon platform bounced
their passengers for several hours before the two-hour return to Port
Douglas. Under those conditions, the Great Barrier Reef was clouded
and uncomfortable.</LD>
<LD>   My suggestion for reef experiences is to go to an island to enjoy
snorkeling and diving from a terra-firma base. Or check with the tour
group that runs the boats to learn about conditions before you leave,
or the day will be wasted.</LD>
<TE>   We found Cairns lackluster and were grateful we were booked in
Palm Cove, halfway between Cairns and Port Douglas. Near our hotel
was Wild World, an animal park where you can see most of the native
Australian animals and birds, hand-feed kangaroos and lorikeets and
have your photo taken holding a koala. It was more fun than that hot
trip on the Kuranda Railroad with no promise of wildlife sightings.
The Daintree forest is also nearby, with fascinating tours of rain
forests and all sorts of critters.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I can think of a dozen better places to drop $400 than Tecate
("Opening a Door to the Other Tecate," Weekend Escape, Jan. 20).</LD>
<LD>   My husband and I had heard Tecate was a quaint, traditional
Mexican town, so we took a trip there just after Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   The town really has very little, if anything, to offer. We spent
about two hours hitting the tourist office and the Centro Artisanal,
which is one store in an otherwise vacant strip center.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe the Rancho Tecate Resort is worth the money, but would
writer Valerie Alvord really recommend the weekend getaway to a
friend?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The problem Jane Engle wrote about ("On the Web, Buyers Face a
Fee-Finding Mission," Travel Insider, Jan. 20) is epidemic throughout
much of the business world, and the reason is simple: In too many
cases the agencies and commissions responsible for regulating
industries don't care about consumers.</LD>
<LD>   There is no reason that airlines, travel agents or online travel
services should be allowed to quote a price without it being the true
price, with all fees and charges included.</LD>
<LD>   At the moment, rental cars seem to be the worst offenders in the
travel business, although airlines and high-end hotels run a close
second.</LD>
<TE>   When I buy a can of peaches at the grocery, the store is required
to charge me the price posted on the shelf. There's no reason the
travel industry should be any different.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Gayle Luque of San Diego was in the middle of a
two-week stay in Cuba when she happened upon these charming kids in
Las Terrazas, a town about 40 miles southwest of Havana.  "They put
their arms around each other, smiled and posed for me," said Luque,
who thinks the children may have caught the fish in a nearby river.
The mountainous Las Terrazas area, devastated by foreign coffee
growers for centuries, has since been terraced with tiers of living
quarters for workers who continue to reforest the landscape. In 1995
the area was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO, the United
Nations arm dedicated to cultural preservation and scientific
education.</CP>

<HD>Open Mike</HD>
<DH>As Sunday's big game nears, it's time for a replay of the
season's bloopers and fumbles ... in the broadcast booth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now, for some really un-enhanced TV: Before Fox presents Super Bowl
XXXVI (that's short for 30-something), let's review some of the more
colorful broadcast fumbles and strange calls of the 2001 football
season. (Don't worry--TV Times' play-review system is much faster
than the NFL's.)</LD>
<LD>   Worst bungling of a cliche: CBS analyst Randy Cross warned that if
the NFL scheduled more night games, it would be "over-milking the
Golden Goose."</LD>
<LD>   Most glaring lack of class: The XFL was created by NBC and
wrestling promoter Vince McMahon, who promised that viewers would get
to know the cheerleaders "on a first-name basis." If a cheerleader
was dating a poorly playing quarterback, McMahon said, sideline
reporters would confront her, "demanding to know whether the two of
them did the wild thing last night."</LD>
<TE>   Best self-revelation: McMahon, in a heated exchange on HBO with
Bob Costas, said: "What, I have no class?"</TE>
<TE>   Most misplaced compassion: CBS sideline reporter Jill Arrington
concluded a halftime interview with Florida coach Steve Spurrier by
saying, "Good luck in the second half, Coach." Spurrier's team led
Mississippi State 35-0 at the time, en route to a 52-0 win.</TE>
<TE>   Cloudiest crystal ball: ABC expert Terry Bowden predicted that
Rutgers could "make it close" against Miami, which won 61-0. He
forecast a defensive struggle between Kansas State and Oklahoma (the
latter won 38-37). And he said he didn't "see a win" the rest of the
way for 0-3 Penn State, which then won five of its next eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Early-exit award: The Times' Larry Stewart caught CBS' Mike Ditka,
a guest commentator on a "Monday Night Football" radio broadcast,
announcing that he was leaving in the middle of the third quarter.
Reason: To beat the traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Gee, it was dry in the booth: CBS' Dick Enberg declared that the
rain was a half-mile away during one Steelers game, only to have the
camera pan to a sideline reporter shivering under a giant umbrella.
Said the reporter, Bonnie Bernstein: "Dick, the rain is a little less
than a half-mile away. It's here."</TE>
<TE>   He could tell you if it was raining, though: Near the end of a
close game, ABC sideline reporter Eric Dickerson said dramatically:
"Now the pressure's on [Jacksonville] quarterback Mark Brunell ...
and the [Packers] are coming after him." Trouble was, as USA Today's
Rudy Martzke pointed out, the Packers had the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Worst career move: Matt Millen quit as a Fox broadcaster to become
general manager of the Detroit Lions, who lost 14 of 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody quits Fox and gets away with it!: Fox cameras gleefully
focused on Millen's face time and again during Lions defeats. Fox
broadcaster Dick Stockton, his former partner, finally groused:
"Matt's getting more air time than he did when he was with me."</TE>
<TE>   Shot down by ads: The Rose Bowl broadcast was so inundated with
commercial plugs, noted Michael Hiestand of USA Today, that "ABC all
but said the air that bowl players breathed was 'brought to you by a
sponsor.'" Especially bizarre was the mention of individual movies as
sponsors, as when broadcaster Tim Brant announced the "'Black Hawk
Down' Game Solution" summary. It "was a mouthful," the Daily News'
Tom Hoffarth wrote, that "no one could possibly solve."</TE>
<TE>   At a loss for words: During Miami's boring 37-14 win over Nebraska
in the Rose Bowl, radio broadcaster Ron Franklin asked sideline
reporter Adrian Karsten: "Do you have a trivial point?" Franklin
corrected himself to say he meant a bit of trivia.</TE>
<TE>   Now that's funny!: ABC, which fired commentator Boomer Esiason in
favor of comic Dennis Miller on "Monday Night Football" two years
ago, saw the show's audience decline for the second straight year.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: During HBO's "Inside the NFL" investigation into
the plight of players who have to relieve themselves during games,
Fox commentator Troy Aikman said: "I've never understood why they
don't have bathrooms on the sidelines."</TE>
<TE>   Flush!: That was the sound of NBC disposing of the XFL after one
season.</TE>
<TE>   Super Bowl programming begins at 10 a.m. today on KTTV, with Fox's
official pre-game show beginning at noon. The game telecast starts at
3 p.m., although the kickoff itself won't take place until about
3:20.</TE>

<HD>Wade: Right Choice for D.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1998, the contest for the open seat in the Orange County district
attorney's office pitted Wally Wade, an assistant district attorney,
against Tony Rackauckas, a Superior Court judge and former deputy in
the office.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas won the endorsement of the union representing the
district attorney deputies and another representing investigators. He
also won The Times' endorsement, and ultimately the election.</LD>
<LD>   What a difference four years has made.</LD>
<TE>   The politically well-connected Rackauckas is now up for
reelection. And Wade, still with the district attorney's office,
although in a lesser capacity as a senior deputy, is again the sole
opponent standing against Rackauckas. The rematch puts the office,
and qualifications for it, back in the public spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, things are far different.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas still has strong political backing, which should help
him raise more campaign funds than Wade. And Rackauckas has
"incumbent" after his name on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But he now also has a track record--his first three years as
district attorney. Based on that performance he no longer has the
support of the deputies in his office. For the first time in its
history, the Assn. of Orange County Deputy District Attorneys is not
supporting its incumbent boss. This switch highlights a growing lack
of confidence in the way Rackauckas is running the office.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Attorneys Assn., composed not only of district
attorney deputies but attorneys from the public defender and county
counsel offices as well, also has voted to support Wade against the
incumbent. The Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, which includes
investigators from the district attorney's office, also abandoned
Rackauckas. It decided to take no side for now.</TE>
<TE>   We agree with the professionals' evaluation of Rackauckas' poor
handling of his office. So we too now urge voters to support Wade.</TE>
<TE>   When Rackauckas took office, we and many others looked for him to
provide the fresh vision he promised. The incumbent has done some
things well, but his office has been sidetracked by persistent
questions about whether his many political associations make it
difficult for him to do his job objectively. His vision has been
clouded by controversy that has split the office into factions, made
a shambles of morale, led to accusations of political favoritism and
misconduct and resulted in no less than six investigations last year
into office controversies.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the more publicized cases include an investigation
involving a friend of the district attorney's and Rackauckas'
intervention in a matter involving one of his key campaign
contributors, multimillionaire George Argyros, now U.S. ambassador to
Spain. This has resulted in several instances in which the state
attorney general had to be enlisted to sort things out.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Rackauckas agreed to dissolve a nonprofit charity he
created after an investigation by the state attorney general
concluded that it was being mismanaged. The Orange County Grand Jury
is also now conducting an in-depth look at the district attorney's
office. Rackauckas supporters describe the jury committee's probe as
a "routine audit," but in a departure from routine that government
observers see as rare, the jury is issuing subpoenas requiring past
and present prosecutors to answer questions about the office's
operation.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney is one of the most powerful and important
posts in county government and the criminal justice system. As such,
it must be run efficiently and without the taint of political
patronage of any kind. Rackauckas is a legally competent top
prosecutor, but his involvement in the cases in contention, and in
outside political activities, compromise the office's historically
apolitical operation.</TE>
<TE>   His questionable decisions and divisive management style make it
clear that the office needs a change in leadership. Wade, a 21-year
veteran prosecutor, is well-qualified and respected in legal circles.</TE>
<TE>   Wade is also a stronger candidate this time, articulating a clear
sense of what needs to be done to remove questions of conflict in the
conduct of the office's business. That makes him the right candidate
for this moment. He has experience, ability and an evenhanded
temperament and management style. And he has the endorsement of the
deputy district attorneys, whose support is vital in restoring
harmony and independence to the office.</TE>
<TE>   Voters should join them and elect Wally Wade as district attorney
on March 5.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>According to the latest housing figures, 2001 wasn't too bad a year
for Orange County residents. And 2002 might even be better.</LD>
<LD>   The year 2001 was the best year on record for home sales across
the nation as interest rates dropped to their lowest level in about
30 years. It was an economic windfall for Orange County homeowners,
who, in record numbers, took advantage of the lower rates to decrease
their existing monthly mortgage payment. Nearly 140,000 residents
refinanced their mortgages, well more than double the number the
previous year.</LD>
<LD>   The lower interest rates also enabled some middle-income renters
to become home owners because of the more affordable monthly
payments. But because new home sales in the county dipped last year,
and the housing inventory remained so low, the median home price
continued to climb. It hit $332,000 in December--the first time that
any Southern California county ended a year above the $300,000 mark.</LD>
<TE>   The good news for some renters is that rent increases haven't been
as sharp and there are more vacancies on the market. Unfortunately,
that's not a countywide condition. The homeless saw a slight
improvement with the opening last year of five new shelters that
added 117 beds, but it's still a woefully inadequate inventory.</TE>
<TE>   What does 2002 hold in store? Predictions are that while housing
prices still will go up, the increases won't be as steep as in years
past and more affordable housing should be available. The county's
Housing and Community Development Department has a goal of adding at
least 1,000 new, affordable rental units to the housing stock in
2002, which is good.</TE>
<TE>   But what's still so sorely needed is more home construction for
low-income buyers to help keep housing costs within the reach of both
renters and buyers.</TE>

<HD>Stirring Up the Water</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concern about water quality off Huntington Beach has dominated the
public debate in Surf City in recent years. Beach closings in past
summers have cast a shadow over an entire recreation industry. Also,
the Orange County Sanitation District's waiver from the Clean Water
Act, permitting the discharge of sewage offshore that is only
partially treated, has stirred a storm of controversy.</LD>
<LD>   One would think that clean, clear water would be getting all the
attention it could. But now we learn that last fall, the district
took a monitoring device that measures the cloudiness of water out of
a Huntington Beach treatment plant shortly after a meeting with a
state water-quality inspector. The inspector questioned whether the
device, which is voluntary, was improperly calibrated and was giving
false readings.</LD>
<LD>   The inspector thus wondered whether the sewage that was going into
the ocean actually exceeded legal limits for turbidity.</LD>
<TE>   Though not required, such monitors can provide an extra layer of
feedback, something this district in particular should want to have,
given the scrutiny it is under. The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality
Control Board apparently agrees. As the chief enforcement arm for
federal and state discharge permits, it is looking at requiring the
district to reinstall the device.</TE>
<TE>   When faced with the possibility of being required to reinstall the
monitor, the district signaled its opposition. It argued that its
current daily lab samples are enough to be sure that partially
treated sewage passes muster under clean-water guidelines, and, in
general, seems to regard having the additional layer of monitoring as
something in the realm of an experiment.</TE>
<TE>   This type of monitoring no doubt measures only one of many
variables in water quality. But these are important times for the
district when sending the right signal on its resolve to thoroughly
test water is important. There is a lot of pressure for the district
to treat the wastewater to the same standard as other agencies across
the nation, and the case for not renewing the waiver is strong.</TE>
<TE>   Given that the waiver renewal is on the table, the district ought
to be taking any extra steps to be sure there is public confidence in
the current level of treatment. The district, after all, is the
largest public agency in the country with a Clean Water Act waiver
and discharges 243 million gallons a day of partially treated waste
water 41/2 miles offshore.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, with all this on its plate, the district is asking the
state to allow it to take on urban runoff. It's a nice sentiment, but
changing the district's charter to broaden its work seems like too
much to take on at this particular time. What it really needs to do
is get its house in order, and prepare for the likelihood of having
to meet a tougher clean-water standard.</TE>

<LD>   Off-road vehicles are the people. These groups are family-oriented
and consist of policemen, firemen, business owners and most other
professions. They are also taxpayers.</LD>
<TE>   Part of this forest plan should include designated and maintained

<HD>For Sanitation District's Critics, the Issue Is Clear</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Sewage Issue Gets Murky," Jan. 27:</LD>
<LD>   I'm not surprised at all that the Orange County Sanitation
District removed a turbidity meter--a pollution monitoring
device--when the readings showed the treated sewage to be cloudier
than allowed.</LD>
<LD>   It should be expected that when the sewage is only treated halfway
that the sewage would be cloudy. This should be a wake-up call to the
public. Demand the sanitation district treat the sewage to full
secondary standards before releasing it into the ocean. Demand the
sanitation district give up its waiver, which allows halfway
treatment.</LD>
<TE>   I know what makes that sewage cloudy. It's toilet water. I want a
clean ocean, one that is not polluted by sewage.</TE>
<TE>   Karin Moran</TE>
<TE>   Surfrider Foundation</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Evidence continues to mount that the Orange County Sanitation
District is putting its own interests above the public's health and
welfare. Once again, data is suppressed that points toward potential
health effects from the district's sewage discharges into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   This time, a turbidity monitor has been rigged such that it cannot
give high readings, even if the water being tested is fully
contaminated. This is akin to rigging a thermometer to go no higher
than 98.6 degrees, regardless of the health of the patient.</TE>
<TE>   Turbidity is an indirect test for fecal matter in water. The more
fecal particles, the murkier the water and the higher the turbidity
levels. It is a testing requirement under both California and federal
law, despite the district's protestations that their testing is
voluntary and not pertinent to the water quality of their discharge.</TE>
<TE>   Based on their history of cover-ups and obfuscation, their
assurances that there are no ill health effects at our swimming
beaches are not worth the paper their press releases are written on.</TE>
<TE>   This type of action is a reflection of the attitude of top
management and is unacceptable. It is time for change at the
district. Top management should be thrown out along with their 301(h)
waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County deserves full sewage treatment and disinfection
prior to discharge into our ocean.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a medical laboratory, the instruments that run tests are
calibrated daily with an industry standard.</TE>
<TE>   Then commercial samples with known concentrations are run through
as test samples. If the reading on these samples is not within the
given range, a new batch of standard material is used to recalibrate
and a new batch of samples is run. If the samples don't fall within
the given range again, then you can deduce that the instrument is not
working and send someone to fix it.</TE>
<TE>   Of course this is all recorded and documented because the
laboratory has many inspections during the year for quality
assurance.</TE>
<TE>   In their inspection, it was noted that Orange County Sanitation
District did not properly calibrate its instrument. If the district
was using that instrument to monitor turbidity as one of the 120
indices required under the Clean Water Act for having the 301(h)
waiver permit to discharge partially treated sewage into the ocean,
then they were in violation of that requirement. They should not be
allowed to renew the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Kris Hardeman</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Sanitation District doesn't like what their
turbidity gauge indicates, so it gets rid of the gauge.</TE>
<TE>   They don't like what their own 1996 20-meter study found, so they
don't publish the report. They don't like the public outcry opposing
the waiver allowing the ocean dumping of partially treated sewage, so
they ignore the public.</TE>
<TE>   The issue may be murky, but the pattern is clear.</TE>

<TE>   Corona del Mar</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News that the Orange County Sanitation District dismissed data
from, and ultimately removed, a turbidity meter that was showing
readings indicating excessive turbidity of treated sewage is not
totally out of character.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, scientists at the district did a 20-meter study, which
showed elevated fecal bacteria in the water column that would have
jeopardized their ocean discharge permit, had it been known. However,
this study was not released to the public until 2000, well after the
permit renewal period, and well after the sanitation district got the
rules changed in 1997 to accommodate the data.</TE>
<TE>   Even to this day, a formal report on this study has never been
released, despite promises by the district over seven months ago to
do so. It is this lack of candor and openness that casts doubt on the
sanitation district's ability to monitor itself. The simple and
elegant solution to this dilemma is to require the sanitation
district to give up its waiver from full secondary treatment
requirements of the Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   At an estimated $50 a year for the average family in Orange
County, this is an affordable safeguard that when people go to the
beach, they can be confident that sewage particles from the
sanitation district's ocean outfall won't come back to haunt them.</TE>

<LD>Re "Santa Ana's Schoolyard Brawl," Jan. 23:</LD>
<LD>   It is always interesting to read about my neighborhood. Your
article describing it as elitist needs a bit of reality check. I have
found it to have more economic and social diversity than many areas
in Orange County. Overall, it is diverse in political persuasions as
well. The objection to the school is location, location, location.</LD>
<LD>   Labeling this area of Santa Ana as racist and exclusive because
there are objections to a modern, state-of-the-art school being built
in the middle of an older, historic neighborhood is a negative
comment on our community.</LD>
<TE>   When you look at the location, it is about two miles from the
entire county and city government center off Flower Street. Flower
Street is greatly impacted by traffic going to and from the Civic
Center adjacent to the county jail.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Freeway and the "Orange Crush" bless many of our
homes with constant noise and air pollution. The neighborhood is
dedicated to maintaining a beautiful preserve in the middle of a
chaotic, congested city hub.</TE>
<TE>   It is odd for a business such as the vacated Farmers Insurance
headquarters to be located in the middle of a residential area in the
first place. One can only wonder how this happened. Perhaps it is an
example of the past failures of Santa Ana city planning.</TE>
<TE>   Should the citizens not object to a proposal that will have great
impact on their homes and quality of life?</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My husband and I have lived in Floral Park for 15 years. It's a
nice neighborhood, and I understand why people are protective of it.
Residents have taken strong stands on issues that affect the
character of the community. Yet I am disheartened by the alarmist
tone of information recently distributed against the proposed new
school site.</TE>
<TE>   Good schools are vital to the life of a city. Witness the distress
of Irvine residents over recent budget cuts and the closing of one of
their elementary schools. The downside to living in an older city is
a shortage of open space available for new school sites. A large and
environmentally safe piece of property is a rare commodity. It's a
real opportunity to be taken advantage of.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana desperately needs more schools. New and modern schools
offer more choices for parents, a better education for our children
and increased prosperity for the community. While we are concerned
about traffic and safety, let's have a civil discussion and keep the
needs of our children foremost in our minds.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cheerleading Squad Picks Decided," Jan. 9:</LD>
<LD>   As captain of the current cheerleading squad at Newport Harbor, I
believe I am justified in voicing a prevalent concern among the
students and cheerleaders.</LD>
<LD>   The cheerleading controversy that has spread throughout the media
has generally given Newport Harbor students, their parents and their
community a stigma of being overindulged and detached from reality.</LD>
<TE>   In truth, there were very few people, if any, who wanted this
issue to be a big deal, besides the media who found it an intriguing
story. Most of the people involved just wished for the issue to be
resolved justly.</TE>
<TE>   The television, radio and newspaper reporters who caught the story
probably did not intend to feed the stereotype of people in Newport
Beach, but I hope that they will learn that a few angry people should
not be able to speak for a squad, school or community.</TE>

<TE>   After reading the article about the mayhem surrounding the
cheerleading tryouts at Newport Harbor High School, I blame the
parents, not the school or the girls, for the circus surrounding
cheerleading tryouts.</TE>
<TE>   Many girls dream of being a cheerleader, supporting their team,
competing themselves, and getting personal recognition. Being popular
in high school is fun. However, in real life there are winners and
losers. Not winning all the time is part of life, and we all need to
go through it.</TE>
<TE>   High school girls need the support of their parents through
comforting them, listening to them, and encouraging them. Sure it
hurts for a while, but time eases pains and disappointments. With
parents stepping in to rescue their daughters, they have sent a
message to their children that they will get what they want because
their parents will bully and protect them.</TE>
<TE>   The girls don't need to be rescued. They need the opportunity to
take risks, solve problems and find their way.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Read the Fine Print, Then Vote 'No,'" (Orange County Commentary,
Jan. 27):</LD>
<LD>   Shirley Conger writes that as a result of Measure W, the
4,700-acre park won't really be a park at all, but rather be razed
and developed. Conger disingenuously quotes a section of Measure W
that simply reiterates existing county law and is not part of changes
proposed by the measure to imply that Measure W would also apply to
all geographic areas of unincorporated portions of the county.</LD>
<LD>   In letters on the same page, William Kearns echoes Conger's
viewpoint that if Measure W passes, El Toro will become "wall-to-wall
housing." Yet, Bonnie O'Neill rebukes Measure W by claiming it would
be unfair that "another whopping 4,700 acres" of park space would be
added to South County. The inconsistencies and misrepresentations
from the Newport-Mesa contingent are getting old. The only common
element is that all three writers simply wish John Wayne Airport
closed and its traffic moved to El Toro.</LD>
<TE>   Robert L. Stein</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shame on you, Shirley. As a resident of Orange County, I demand
that El Toro be cleaned up to the level it was before the Marines
came in. That is the law and she is well aware of it. She and the
rest of the pro-airport contingent would gladly take the land in a
poisoned state to ram an airport through, leaving Orange County
taxpayers holding the bag for the costly cleanup. What effect do you
suppose an airport would have on the environment?</TE>
<TE>   Measure W will not raise taxes. It simply rezones El Toro land for
a park and nature preserve, making an aviation use there an
impossibility. No new taxes may be levied to build the park unless
two-thirds of Orange County voters say OK. It's the law (Propositions
13 and 218).</TE>
<TE>   I've read the fine print and I vote a resounding Yes for Measure
W. I love Orange County and I want to see it become an even more
desirable place to live.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Tarhan</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Apparently leaders of the anti-El Toro airport effort believe they
cannot win an election without deception. They crafted Measure F,
which ignored rules in order to create an initiative that had a good
chance to win. It did win, but airport proponents claim that was due
to the legal flaws within it. That opinion was confirmed by two
courts who, in harsh language, criticized the initiative. The first
court nullified Measure F, and the appeals court confirmed that
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Not deterred, airport antagonists create Measure W. Unfortunately,
it too is deceptive and does not give voters the whole truth. Shirley
Conger points out some of the hidden information contained within it.
Also, it is what the measure does not say that is of concern to me.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Measure W claims the park plan will not cost
taxpayers. That is misleading because Measure W simply changes the
zoning of that land. The initiative does not include costs to build
the park. Credible studies indicate the park will indeed cost
billions to build, and while some donations may come forth, the bulk
of expenses likely will be paid by taxpayers. I refuse to be deceived
this time. I'm voting no on Measure W and hope you will join me.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Fry</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Conger's commentary begs for a rebuttal. She worries about
the use of taxpayer dollars to fund the park. Well, last time I
checked, the $40-plus million that Orange County supervisors have
spent, and any FAA grants to be obtained, are funds from taxes. Not
to mention the bailout that taxpayers will have to eventually pay to
cover the El Toro airport bonds when it fails to generate enough
revenue to pay the investors; the state road funds to cover added
freeway lanes; the county tax moneys to pay for aviation rights over
Laguna Woods, and for soundproofing of thousands of homes and
hundreds of schools.</TE>
<TE>   Conger claims Measure W is "an environmentalist's nightmare."
Let's review the airport plan. There are the car trips per day, the
tanker trunks round the clock to deliver fuel, the 400 to 800
airplane trips per day. I think we easily can see which use is the
environmentalist's nightmare. And what about the contamination
already at the base? A park can be built in the several thousand
"clean" acres at El Toro, avoiding the "dirty" acres while these are
cleaned up, but an airport would require reconstruction of all
runways, tarmacs and hangars, emitting tons of contaminated dust
directly into the lungs of everyone in the county.</TE>

<TE>   It is so nice to find out that even the pro-airport people think
that the Great Park sounds like a dream come true. And I hope it
will.</TE>
<TE>   Three supervisors went to Washington to seek funding for the
airport from the FAA. It is much more important that our tax dollars
be spent to help pay for the expensive new security systems at
established airports and the higher salaried, qualified security
people than help funding a new airport.</TE>

<TE>   Will the South County proponents of Measure W please explain where
the money is going to come from for their grand park? They are either
really naive or laying a giant smokescreen if they think they can
pull it off without using taxes. Do they really expect us to believe
some white knight will present them with a bucket of gold?</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe the grand wizard will wave a wand and transform all this
property into their utopian garden. They have been reading too many
Harry Potter books. And, after this magical land transformation takes
place; where will the revenues needed to maintain this grand folly
come from?</TE>
<TE>   The NIMBYs keep referring to Central Park, Balboa Park and
Griffith Park; and I wonder just how much revenue, after expenses,
these parks put back into the local economies.</TE>

<TE>   Anaheim Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I continue to shake my head in amazement at the absurd arguments
the pro-El Toro airport people would have us believe. Not building a
massive international airport will be "an environmentalist's
nightmare?" Sorry, Shirley Conger. That's right up there with the
fantasy that the airport will reduce air pollution and traffic.
Ultimately, the voters will decide for themselves what constitutes
quality of life, be it park or airport. No amount of logic mangling
from the Newport spin artists will change that.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Parallel Park: Let's Be Like San Diego," (Orange County
Commentary, Jan. 27):</TE>
<TE>   No on Measure W will allow you to sponsor the same plan as did the
ladies of San Diego because South County will be given a park larger
than Central Park in N.Y. and Balboa Park in San Diego combined.
Additionally the Airport Park will bring South County open space up
to 121,870 acres as opposed to 8,000 acres for North County.</TE>
<TE>   True, the authors of Measure W did not say, "We want your tax
dollars for our use." However, we taxpayers are spending millions
just to maintain an empty airport. How much more of our taxes will
you need to rip up runways, and bring 50-year-old homes up to code?
And how much rent will you be able to ask homeless people to pay?</TE>

<LD>Re "Deep Budget Cuts Finally Hit Irvine Schools Hard," Jan. 27.</LD>
<LD>   I just wish to set the record straight about class sizes in Irvine
Unified School District. Your paper has been saying that Irvine will
have to do away with class-size reduction in grades kindergarten,
second, and third. Kindergarten has never had 20 on the roll.</LD>
<LD>   This is my 30th year teaching kindergarten in this district and I
have never had only 20 in my class. I now have 33 boys and girls that
I am teaching to read, to write in sentences, to learn the addition
and subtraction facts, as well as those developmental skills 4- and
5-year-olds are supposed to be working on.</LD>
<TE>   I have 33 report cards to complete, 33 parent conferences, and 33
little people that I am responsible for each day. It is time that our
neighborhoods get the correct information about our class sizes.</TE>

<LD>Re "City Gets Earful From Impatient Wal-Mart Patrons," Jan. 24:</LD>
<LD>   I support the decision of Huntington Beach Mayor Debbie Cook to
not issue the permit until Wal-Mart has fulfilled the city's
requirements on park improvements, and I am in shock that Wal-Mart
would do such a thing to our community. The actions show that it is
only interested in making profit, and not interested in the community
it is about to be part of.</LD>
<LD>   I feel that if given the chance, Wal-Mart would not complete the
improvements it agreed to. I now worry more than before how Wal-Mart
will maintain its store and surrounding area; will Wal-Mart continue
to place profits above the community? Thank you Huntington Beach for
doing the right thing!</LD>

<LD>Re "O.C. Judge Accused of Child Molesting," Jan. 11.</LD>
<LD>   To understand that an individual can be charged with such a
heinous crime and still be compensated by the taxpayers is such a
contradiction in terms it cannot be understood. The $134,224 annual
salary that Judge Ronald C. Kline will continue to receive pending
disposition of the criminal matter should be deferred, and if not
deferred it should be recovered in full if and when he is found
guilty. By no possible interpretation imaginable is it right that the
hard-working, law-abiding taxpayers should have to foot the bill for
this "person's" bail, or legal defense costs.</LD>

<HD>Runway or Walkway? Measure W to Decide</HD>
<DH>To keep our quality of life high and our economy strong,
the county must handle its fair share of air traffic. We need an
airport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STAN OFTELIE and REED ROYALTY</AU>
<BD>Stan Oftelie is president of the Orange County
Business Council. Reed Royalty is president of the Orange County
Taxpayers Assn.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the planning of El Toro airport complete, opponents have
qualified yet another anti-airport initiative--their third in five
years--for the March ballot. The only thing Measure W will do is
eliminate the option for El Toro airport. Measure W will not build a
"Great Park." According to County Auditor David E. Sundstrom, "the
specific developments identified in the city of Irvine 'Great Park'
proposal are not part of the initiative and would not necessarily
occur as a result of its passage."</LD>
<LD>   In the last decade, California failed to build a single power
plant. As a result of this failure our electric bills have doubled.
The utility crisis underscores the importance of developing important
infrastructure such as airports that are needed to support a growing
population and economy. With the shortest commercial jet runway in
the United States on just 500 acres, John Wayne Airport is inadequate
to move the goods and services of the 32nd largest economy in the
world.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County's explosive growth during the last two decades has
driven the need for El Toro airport. Once a series of cattle ranches
and sleepy surf towns, South County now has 663,000 high-income
residents and almost 60 million square feet of office, manufacturing,
retail and research buildings. And South County is still growing.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County must become a responsible citizen in our regional
economy. We can't continue to clog the freeways with our passengers
and cargo and expect Los Angeles or Ontario to solve our problem.
Riverside's residents have told Orange County, by City Council
resolution, that they don't want our air passengers. Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn has told the region that every county needs to do
its fair share because LAX can't grow much more.</TE>
<TE>   The plan for El Toro airport is responsive to "quality of life"
concerns. To minimize impacts on surrounding residents, the Board of
Supervisors has capped El Toro's growth at slightly more than twice
the passenger level of John Wayne. Surrounded by a noise buffer zone
the size of Fullerton, El Toro will be one of the airports most
sensitive to residents in America. Only the new Denver airport has
more open space around it than El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Aircraft will follow specific FAA-approved flight paths where the
closest residence is miles from the airfield. El Toro airport means
no more two-hour drives to LAX. The idea that Orange County residents
will use Palmdale Regional Airport (103 miles from Orange County) or
George Air Force Base in Victorville (88 miles from Santa Ana) is
folly. While all the outlying airports are important, they are not
the solution for Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   California has not built a new airport since World War II. As
airport demand rises, Orange County is poised to solve its air
transportation problems with the development of El Toro. In area, El
Toro is almost 10 times the size of John Wayne Airport and can handle
our airport needs safely for the next hundred years.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's taxpayers will get El Toro virtually at no cost
from the federal government if we redevelop it as an airport. The
Orange County Taxpayers Assn. has found that taxpayers will not pay
for the airport. Passengers will.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro's development will be financed like every other airport in
the United States--by the users of the facility that generate funds
for FAA grants and debt service on revenue bonds. If you don't use
the airport, you don't pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, how will a Great Park be financed? Like every major
park in California--by your property taxes. The Irvine City Council
in 2000 rejected the Great Park's financing plan; one member called
it "overly optimistic" and another, "misleading junk."</TE>
<TE>   South County already has 103,000 acres of parks and open
space--one acre for every six residents. Conversely, North County has
only 8,000 acres of parks--one acre for every 246 residents. El Toro
airport is a balance between quality of life for residents and the
need for economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Most important is El Toro's role in our national security. We
learned from Sept. 11 that the world is an unstable place. Preserving
El Toro's runways for use by the military will be vital to our
nation's defense. Tearing them up for a park would be wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, quality of life begins with a job. El Toro airport will
be a job generator. As former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said in his
farewell address to New Yorkers, "New York must rebuild and continue
to grow--cities that don't grow will die." El Toro airport allows
Orange County to continue growing and thriving by generating an
estimated 65,000 new jobs, according to the Orange County Business
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Let's stop the bickering and join to ensure that our quality of
life is preserved and our economy is strong. El Toro airport is for
our future.</TE>

<HD>Runway or Walkway? Measure W to Decide</HD>
<DH>The politically driven plan to put an unwanted, unneeded
and unsafe airport at El Toro is not what the county should be
spending its energy on. Let Riverside County have it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLAN SONGSTAD</AU>
<BD>Alan Songstad is chairman of the El Toro Reuse
Planning Authority and a Laguna Hills City Council member.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Measure W finally will end the fight over a commercial airport at El
Toro. After eight years and more than $50 million, the county has
come up with a politically driven airport plan that has no merit from
an aviation standpoint. It is, quite simply, unwanted, unneeded and
unsafe.</LD>
<LD>   To accommodate the community, the Marines operated El Toro at
nearly banker's hours, with nighttime and weekend curfews except in
times of national emergency. Due to the proximity to homes along the
flight paths, El Toro was closed because the Marines could no longer
operate a fighter jet training base.</LD>
<LD>   The Marines generally flew relatively light, high performance
jets, and didn't need passenger terminals, baggage handling, or U.S.
Customs. More important, they didn't have to follow FAA airport
design and operating standards.</LD>
<TE>   Now the county wants to build an airport that would operate only
large commercial aircraft, 365 days per year, 24 hours a day, seven
days per week.</TE>
<TE>   A second commercial airport is not needed to meet Orange County's
current or future air travel demand. Today, about 2.8 million people
reside in the county, and our population is projected to grow by
about 18% or 500,000 people in 20 years. The refurbished John Wayne
Airport serves about 7.7 million annual passengers and has a
court-imposed cap of 8.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   However, the existing airport can accommodate more passengers
without expansion or significant negative impacts. In fact, the city
of Newport Beach has proposed an increase to 9.8 million to support
the extension of the current flight restrictions. This is more than
enough to meet our current and future needs.</TE>
<TE>   Airports should be put where they are wanted and needed. In 20
years, the Inland Empire will grow by more than 2 million people.
Ontario Airport now serves about 6.7 million annual passengers but
can grow to serve many more. The city of Ontario and many others in
Riverside County support that growth. Ontario's service area includes
about 80% of Orange County. Furthermore, the communities surrounding
the former Air Force bases at March, Norton and George all want and
need their airports to expand. This is why the proponents of March in
Riverside and George in Victorville have joined ETRPA and the anti-El
Toro movement.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro is unsafe. The county's airport plan does not operate the
way the Marines did for heavy aircraft, including Air Force One. By
touting the recent FAA Airspace Determination as a safety
endorsement, the county grossly misstates the intent and conclusion
of the report.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA does not say El Toro is safe. In fact, the report says
that at only 4 million passengers, El Toro will cause severe delays
at nearby airports. Bill Withycomb, head of the FAA Western Region,
said El Toro is like "driving the wrong way on the freeway"--it's
theoretically possible, but it's not very smart. With more
passengers, the picture gets bleaker.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) asked the FAA to run more
numbers on El Toro at 18 million passengers. The result--El Toro
shuts down the airspace of Southern California and backs up air
traffic across North America. The county's cavalier response is to
simply redesign the airspace. This means changing the approach
patterns, noise and other environmental impacts at every airport in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   It simply won't work.</TE>
<TE>   For six years, there has been a constant drumbeat of aviation
experts, including two pilots associations representing more than
60,000 commercial pilots, the Air Transport Association, Air Traffic
Controllers and individual airlines, warning that the county's plan
is unworkable and unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   As the county was set to approve the EIR for El Toro, the Airline
Pilots Association issued a press release headlined: "Pilots Say El
Toro Airport Plan is Not Viable as Proposed." Concurrently, the
Allied Pilots Association, representing American Airline's pilots,
issued a statement to "... restate our objections to the conversion
of MCAS El Toro to a civilian commercial service airport." Yet,
despite these and many other warnings, the Board of Supervisors, on a
3-2 vote, approved El Toro as a commercial airport.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W will stop the debate that is tearing this county apart.
It will reverse Measure A, the so-called airport mandate, which
passed in 1994 by less than 1%.</TE>
<TE>   It will change the zoning at El Toro from an airport to public use
to be built over time, with amenities such as a park, schools and
universities, sports and recreation areas, museums, theaters,
agricultural and nature preserves.</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup to restore El Toro to residential standards is already
underway by the Navy. The park use is much gentler on the land than
an airport, and will ensure that the property is thoroughly cleaned.</TE>
<TE>   Once the voters pass Measure W, we can all breathe easier, get on
with planning for the future of our county, and put this long battle
behind us.</TE>

<HD>Muslim Chaplain Embraces New Job Ministering to War
Detainees</HD>
<DH>Religion: The Camp Pendleton-based cleric tries 'to look
into their souls' and respect their dignity, yet be cautious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMP PENDLETON</DL>
<LD>When he was an enlisted sailor working at the Pentagon, he was part
of a small, devout group of Muslims who persuaded the skeptical brass
to let them hold Friday prayer sessions.</LD>
<LD>   Later, after becoming a U.S. citizen, an officer and a chaplain,
he was selected as the first Muslim cleric assigned to the Marine
Corps and 17 months ago was sent to this sprawling base north of San
Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Navy Lt. Abuhena Saif-ul-Islam has another assignment with no
historic precedent: to provide spiritual guidance and comfort to the
captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters being held at the U.S. naval
base in Guantanamo, Cuba.</LD>
<TE>   At first stunned at being chosen for the high-profile assignment,
he caught the first military flight to Guantanamo late last month and
now tends daily to 158 detainees branded by officials as some of the
most dangerous and duplicitous enemies ever encountered by the U.S.
military.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to make any judgments about them," Saif-ul-Islam said
in a telephone interview. "I approach them as human beings and try to
look into their souls. I see a lot of fear. I see people praying hard
for God to help them."</TE>
<TE>   At Camp Pendleton, where Saif-ul-Islam provides counseling to
Marines of all religions, including 40 to 50 fellow Muslims, his
fellow chaplains are not surprised that he has taken to his temporary
duty in a quietly efficient manner.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard he had been asked, I knew he was exactly the right
person for the job," said Navy Capt. Gary Dallmann, head chaplain at
Camp Pendleton.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 14 Muslim chaplains in the U.S. military--three of whom are
in the Navy--most are converts, according to the Pentagon. The
39-year-old Saif-ul-Islam, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1989 from
Bangladesh, was raised in the faith.</TE>
<TE>   Saif-ul-Islam speaks fluent Urdu, the language of Pakistan, and
some Arabic, considered the mother tongue of Islam. Translators are
helping him communicate with some of the prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous human-rights groups have decried the treatment of the
detainees, who are being held in open-air wire enclosures. But
Saif-ul-Islam said the detainees have not complained of their
treatment. He meets them daily to listen to their individual
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent is to treat them in a dignified way," he said. "Of
course, there is security. But they have been given the very best
medical treatment. Some detainees told me they're praying for the
guards who are taking care of them and working hard to bring them
water and take them to the bathroom."</TE>
<TE>   Saif-ul-Islam said he expected hostility from the detainees and
has been pleasantly surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I came to Guantanamo, I had some fear, some reservation,"
he said. "As an American in uniform, would they accept me? Now, I
have no fear. I do not approach them in fear. They know they have no
reason to fear me, but still I know it is good to be cautious. The
guards are always there."</TE>
<TE>   Although the detainees have been described as boiling with anger
at America and Americans, Saif-ul-Islam finds them mostly confused
and anxious about the future.</TE>
<TE>   "They're pretty consistent in seeking God's help," he said. "The
Koran says God helps those who are patient. They're very patient.
Five times a day they are praying to God to forgive them and to help
them. They say, 'If I am guilty, let me know my punishment. If I am
not guilty, why are you keeping me?'"</TE>
<TE>   Raised in a middle-class family, Saif-ul-Islam came to the U.S.
looking for greater opportunities than his impoverished homeland
offered. He was attracted to the military because of the job security
and opportunity for advancement.</TE>
<TE>   With a business degree from a college in Bangladesh, he enlisted
in the Navy and spent five years as a financial analyst, including
two at the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Like many immigrants who become Americans by choice, his
patriotism and sense of obligation to his adopted country are
full-strength.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an honor and a privilege to serve the country," he said of
his new assignment. "I hope I make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Saif-ul-Islam became a citizen in 1998 and thus eligible to become
an officer. Even as he adjusted to a new country, his interest in the
religion of his upbringing increased. He attended an Islamic
institute in Virginia and then chaplaincy school in Newport, R.I.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 4,000 Muslims serve in the military. The Army
commissioned its first Muslim chaplain in 1993, followed soon by the
Navy. The Navy provides chaplains to the Marine Corps.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Saif-ul-Islam and other Muslim chaplains and
chaplain assistants were given a new assignment: explain Islam to
troops who know little about the ancient faith, and rebut Osama bin
Laden's assertion that Islam condones violence and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Saif-ul-Islam was sent to Egypt in early October along with
Marines from Camp Pendleton to take part in Operation Bright Star, a
previously scheduled multination exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those Marines are now in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Saif-ul-Islam is unequivocal in his belief that Bin Laden's brand
of violent fundamentalism is counter to the teaching of the Koran and
that the U.S. war on terrorism is both necessary and morally
justified. "Our cause is very noble: defend our country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Camp Pendleton, Dallmann said Saif-ul-Islam's concern for the
detainees is an expression of his patriotism, however paradoxical
that might seem.</TE>
<TE>   "Offering humanitarian assistance to our enemies is never an
attack on ourselves," Dallmann said. "Just the contrary; when we do
so, we express what is most valuable and precious about our culture
and society."</TE>
<TE>   Saif-ul-Islam does not know when he will return to San Diego and
his wife, who is a doctor, and their 2-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   On behalf of the detainees, he has asked the officers in charge of
the so-called Camp X-Ray for more Korans, skullcaps, prayer rugs and
for permission to allow the detainees to grow back their beards.</TE>
<TE>   "How we treat the detainees, how we do things here, is a
reflection on us," he said.</TE>

<HD>Test Results Private at Private Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: Many parents don't seem to mind, relying on
personal visits to evaluate campuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though recent landmark legislation has put more pressure on the
nation's public schools to score well on standardized tests, private
schools are largely exempt from this accountability movement.</LD>
<LD>   About 640,000 kindergarten-through-12th-grade students in
California--or 10% of the school population--attend private
institutions. But most of these 4,200 schools don't publish their
test scores, and they doggedly resist calls from interested parents
to do so.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not that we want to hide them. It's because they're grossly
misinterpreted by the people," said Rina Ngo, director of elementary
curriculum for the schools operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Some parents say not being able to see scores for all schools
makes comparison shopping difficult. But far more parents--even as
they demand scores from public schools--seem content to go without
such information in the case of private ones. They hold these schools
accountable in different ways--by visiting them, for example, and
talking to other parents.</TE>
<TE>   "People are buying a pig in a poke," said Sara Lieber McKinney, a
retired Los Angeles public school teacher who would like private
campuses to disclose test scores. "Anybody who's selling something to
the public ... should be very open."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all private schools do test their students, but differences
in the tests and their reporting make it difficult to compare scores.
Some private schools use versions of the Stanford 9 tests that are
given at California public campuses; others administer an exam that
is considered more difficult: the Educational Records Bureau's
Comprehensive Testing Program.</TE>
<TE>   And in cases where comparisons can be made--for example on the SAT
for college admission--private-school students consistently outscore
those in public systems.</TE>
<TE>   But for Claire Joseph, who is looking at public and private
kindergartens for her twins, test scores "don't measure the things
that are most important to me."</TE>
<TE>   "All you have to do is spend two hours with your child, see him do
some math, see him do some English and you'll see exactly where he's
strongest," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Weaver, headmaster of Crossroads School in Santa Monica,
agreed that campus visits are a good gauge of quality.</TE>
<TE>   "Breathe the air, see what the school culture is about and see
what life for a student feels like," he said. "Look at what the
school says it stands for and whether that squares up with what you
want for your kid."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mindy Danna, who is looking at public and private schools
for her 5-year-old daughter, says she would appreciate information
that would allow her to make direct comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be apples and apples instead of apples and oranges," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Danna decided to move because she was disappointed in the test
scores of the public campus in her Park La Brea neighborhood--a snap
judgment, she admits. But like many other parents dismayed by public
school scores, she may choose to send her daughter to a private
school without benefit of the same information.</TE>
<TE>   Private-school educators have generally been able to fend off
calls for making scores public by pointing out that they receive no
funding from taxpayers. Parents' tuition checks keep them
accountable, they contend.</TE>
<TE>   Policymakers have tended to accept that argument.</TE>
<TE>   "They're private for a reason, and I'm comfortable with that,"
said state Sen. Dede Alpert (D-Coronado), author of the legislation
that requires standardized testing in California's public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, when President Bush signed federal legislation
requiring annual reading and math tests for children in third through
eighth grades, private schools were not included.</TE>
<TE>   Those in private education often argue that to publish private
schools' test scores and compare them with those of public campuses
would feed the misperception that raw numbers, rankings and
percentiles can predict where a particular child will flourish.</TE>
<TE>   If Crossroads' Weaver had his druthers, he would scrap all
standardized tests. As it is, his school must administer certain
exams to belong to the California Assn. of Independent Schools and to
get its students into college.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole testing thing is based on a fantasy that what is
easiest to measure is what's most important to measure," Weaver said.
"It's exactly backward. The most important things to measure are also
the hardest."</TE>
<TE>   No multiple-choice test can measure creativity, artistic talent,
self-confidence and morals, he said, echoing some of the criticisms
that opponents have leveled against public-school testing.</TE>
<TE>   Some educators say these tests have value: The results can confirm
what teachers suspect about students' abilities and reveal areas in
which a student, class or grade level might need work.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't put me in the classroom," said Hope Boyd, head of
Wildwood School in Los Angeles. "It just gives me a window in, so I
can ask further questions."</TE>
<TE>   Boyd and other private educators often encounter parents who
demand to see test scores before they enroll their children.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you can show your scores, it is a deal breaker" for such
people, said Eve Fein, director of Morasha School in Rancho Santa
Margarita. Because the Jewish elementary school does not give out its
students' scores, "this is probably not the school" for those
parents, she added.</TE>
<TE>   Other private campuses do provide schoolwide scores for
comparison, particularly high schools. West Valley Christian School
lists its students' SAT results alongside those of public schools in
the western San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps to just kind of say, 'Here's where we're at, and here's
how they're doing,'" said Robert Lozano, the school's administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of where the debate comes to rest, Weaver said, private
schools will not diverge from their lessons "to prepare kids to fill
in [answer] bubbles" on testing forms.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a fight we're going to fight till we drop," he said.
"We're never going to go down that road."</TE>

<LD>Facing stiff competition for reelection, Rep. Gary A. Condit
(D-Ceres) dipped into his campaign funds to pay lawyers and a
publicist he hired last year to deal with fallout from his
relationship with a missing California woman.</LD>
<LD>   Condit's fund-raising also dropped sharply following the
disappearance of 24-year-old Chandra Levy and Condit's acknowledgment
of a close relationship with her, according to his latest campaign
finance disclosure.</LD>
<LD>   He raised less than $37,000 in the second half of 2001--a fifth of
what he took in during the previous six months. Condit's once-healthy
campaign account balance, which was $316,000 in July, fell to less
than $73,000 at year's end.</LD>

<LD>The California Highway Patrol grounded half of its fleet of 14
airplanes Friday after receiving a warning from the manufacturer
about potential problems with the planes' engines.</LD>
<LD>   The planes, which the agency has been using to patrol dams and
other key facilities in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
may be out of service for two weeks, said CHP Commissioner Dwight
"Spike" Helmick.</LD>
<LD>   Helmick ordered the seven Cessna planes grounded after receiving a
bulletin from Textron Lycoming, the engine manufacturer, warning of
potential problems with the crankshafts and instructing that the
engines be sent to Pennsylvania for repairs.</LD>
<TE>   The 14 airplanes were purchased about a year ago at a cost of
about $7 million, Helmick said.</TE>

<LD>Rep. Barbara Lee's opposition to military retaliation for the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks earned her death threats and hate mail. It also
has garnered Lee thousands of dollars from those who applaud her
stance, including entertainers Bonnie Raitt and Bill Cosby.</LD>
<LD>   According to campaign records, the Oakland Democrat has pulled in
$177,280 since June, more than twice what she typically raises. Of
that, $124,909 poured in after Lee voted against the rest of Congress
in September. Her 9th District seat, including the historically
dovish cities of Oakland and Berkeley, is up for reelection this

<LD>The federal government paid California farmers $780 million in
subsidies last year, with primarily large cotton and rice-producing
farms receiving 51% of the money.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Farm Service Agency, which wrote the checks, called
them a reflection of the state's poor agricultural economy.</LD>

<HD>Screener Blames Himself</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Suspicious passenger was detected at the San
Francisco airport but slipped away from a distracted rookie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Romeo Abelida admits he made mistakes. And now the 57-year-old rookie
airport security screener says he's waiting at home to hear if he'll
lose his job with Argenbright Security.</LD>
<LD>   Abelida allowed an unidentified man whose shoes triggered an
explosives-testing machine to slip away into the crowd last week at
San Francisco International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The security breach forced the evacuation of United Airlines' main
terminal, delayed thousands of passengers and has prompted
investigations into why an hour passed before the Federal Aviation
Administration was told of the incident.</LD>
<TE>   The Filipino immigrant, a college graduate, told the San Jose
Mercury News that he didn't turn his back on the traveler but that he
was overly focused on results of the cotton swab he'd run over the
man's carry-on luggage and shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Abelida said he should have told the man to stay put, or held onto
the shoes. "That was my error. Our job is to have full control," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   When he realized the man was gone, Abelida followed protocol and
found his supervisor, rather than calling the National Guard or other
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said it's unfair to blame Abelida alone, with three months
on the job, including a week of training. Only two National Guard
soldiers were allotted to keep watch over Abelida and up to 40 other
screeners as hundreds of passengers streamed through five security
lines, according to airport and National Guard officials.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not enough personnel on the checkpoint to stand at each
one of those places or to watch it all the time," said National Guard
Sgt. 1st Class Tom Jacobs.</TE>
<TE>   FAA spokesman Jerry Snyder said the airline is responsible for
security at the checkpoint and could have evacuated immediately,
rather than letting an hour go by while trying to find the man.
United Airlines, which contracts with Argenbright, denies it is at
fault for the breach.</TE>
<TE>   Screening bags is Abelida's first job since he moved with his wife
in July from the Philippines, where he worked in the insurance
industry. He said the new $13-an-hour airport job paid the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement and airport officials initially thought Abelida's
English skills played a part in the security breach.</TE>
<TE>   Daz Lamparas, a representative of the union for security screeners
at the airport, said the problem was not language but inexperience
and a lack of supervision.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't leave an inexperienced person without a supervisor," he
said. "There should have been a backup person right there."</TE>
<TE>   Argenbright said it is investigating and will decide whether
training procedures need changing.</TE>

<HD>Hendrick Follows Passion to Success</HD>
<DH>Motor sports: Owner's teams have won eight NASCAR titles,
among them five in Winston Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE SPENCER</AU>
<BD>THE SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Hendrick is not your typical used-car salesman.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, he probably could sell air conditioners in Iceland, but it
takes more than marketing skills to become a giant among auto dealers
and the owner of a motor sports empire that has won eight NASCAR
titles--five Winston Cup, three truck--in the last seven seasons.</LD>
<LD>   It takes a passion for what you're doing and an unwavering
determination to carry out the vision.</LD>
<TE>   Hendrick has both--along with a gift for making people feel
comfortable. He inspires those around him to accomplish goals and to
reach beyond them. And he makes it seem easy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, after winning three drag boat championships, Hendrick
shifted his racing interest to stock cars. His dream began to take
shape in a ramshackle garage in Harrisburg, N.C., less than a mile
from Lowe's Motor Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   There, Hendrick learned the nuances of Winston Cup racing from the
late Harry Hyde, one of the sport's wiliest crew chiefs.  It's no
accident the site of Hendrick's original shop is home to an 86,000
square-foot workshop recently completed for the Winston Cup teams of
champion Jeff Gordon and rookie Jimmie Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The structure overlooks the rest of the sprawling Hendrick Motor
sports complex, which is also home for two-time points champion Terry
Labonte and Jerry Nadeau in Winston Cup and the newly formed Busch
Series teams of three-time truck champion Jack Sprague and Hendrick's
21-year-old son, Ricky.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrick Motor sports occupies 70 acres and 13 buildings.
Hendrick's infectious work ethic motivates 250 employees spread among
his six teams, engine shop, chassis shop, research and development
department and the administrative and marketing arms.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrick reached 103 victories last season when Gordon increased
his career total to 58. Only Petty Enterprises has more wins, with
271. And Hendrick has become an innovator along the way, setting up
the model for other multicar operations. He has learned to follow his
instincts--and he gets positive vibes from the new Gordon/Johnson
combination.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told that I would never win a championship running multiple
teams, but you have to take advantage of the opportunities when the
guys are available," Hendrick said. "The success of the truck teams
with two units with a rookie and a veteran together--one team, two
cars--was a pilot for us.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew [Johnson] was going to go somewhere, he wasn't going to
wait, and it was an opportunity for us. We figured a veteran like
Jeff would make a great role model for Jimmie. I believe Jimmie has
the whole package. He has what it takes to be a champion."</TE>
<TE>   Hendrick has that same feeling for all of his drivers. He takes it
as a personal attack when critics accuse him of playing favorites
with Gordon's team. He says all his teams receive identical
equipment, and he shares his crews' disappointment when they
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is to identify weaknesses," Hendrick said. "The successful
things just happen by themselves. We want to identify problems and
work on fixing them. I'm kind of the Roto-Rooter man in that I clean
up the mess.</TE>
<TE>   "It tears my heart out that the fans don't feel like I give [equal
consideration] to the other teams. I thought about opening my books
to the media to do an audit and see how much we spend on engines and
how much we spend on cars. I think if I wasn't giving them good stuff
or as good of stuff, you would hear rumblings from those guys that we
weren't."</TE>
<TE>   That's not the case. Three of his crew chiefs--Tony Furr with
Nadeau, Jim Long with Labonte and Chad Knaus with Johnson--are former
Hendrick employees, and they knew they could come home again.</TE>
<TE>   It's because Hendrick doesn't just invest money in his teams. He
invests himself. His success is proof of the return.</TE>

<HD>Print It: Iginla Becomes a Star</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jarome Iginla checks the newspaper. Every morning. This is not
because he is vain but rather because he is skeptical. Yet there it
is, every morning, his name first on the list of the NHL's goal
scorers.</LD>
<LD>   Iginla is aware that even this distinction does not make him
famous, except maybe in Canada. He is aware that his brown skin and
baby face lead many who first meet him to wonder if he is a hockey
player at all. Even to him, there are times it all sounds ridiculous,
that a 24-year-old with a previous season-high mark of 31 goals could
have already surpassed that number, besting the likes of Keith
Tkachuk, Jeremy Roenick, Eric Lindros.</LD>
<LD>   Yet there is his name in the newspaper, and here he is  an
All-Star who's headed to Salt Lake City for the Olympics. "Sometimes,
you just kind of shake your head,'' said Iginla.</LD>
<TE>   "The Olympic thing was especially amazing, and even now, when I'm
interviewed and asked how Canada is going to do, I still feel like a
fan," he said.  "I say, 'Well, I think they have a great shot,' and
then I'm like, 'Whoa. It's we. I think we have a great shot.'"</TE>
<TE>   Iginla's is not the only new face popping up in  the Olympics.
Players like Joe Thornton, Mark Parrish and Eric Daze have been
bumping the likes of Lemieux, Lindros and Joe Sakic down the stat
sheets, and many of the league's former top scorers are missing from
the page.</TE>
<TE>   Iginla may be the most striking. Markus Naslund, who is tied with
Iginla in scoring with 58 points, is 28 and has been turning heads
since last year, when he racked up 41 goals. Thornton, who has 56
points, has been claiming attention since the day he went No. 1 in
the 1997 draft.</TE>
<TE>   For parts of this season, Iginla has been the NHL's top player, at
least by the numbers. He has led the league in goals and in scoring
for much of the last few months. He also leads the Flames in nearly
every category, and remains among the team's most physical players.</TE>
<TE>   "He might be the best forward in the NHL," said Wayne Gretzky,
general manager of the Canadian Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   Iginla took up hockey at age 7. He  had an  unusual childhood
until then--living in Edmonton, he had an American mother, a Nigerian
father and maternal grandparents who helped raise him after his
parents divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Iginla excelled first at baseball and then in hockey. He finally
decided the ice had his heart, although he remembers being troubled
when friends occasionally questioned his ability.</TE>
<TE>   "The other kids were like, there aren't black players in the NHL,
you're never going to make it," Iginla said. Occasionally, he would
also hear racial taunting on the ice, ''but nothing too major at
all," he said. "The real thing was the idea that there weren't that
many black players in the league, and it was something I wanted so
badly. Fortunately, Grant Fuhr was right in Edmonton, and I could
point to him."</TE>
<TE>   With a role model in Fuhr and the encouragement of his family,
Iginla was able to speed up the junior ranks, and in 1995 he was
drafted 11th overall by the Dallas Stars. He was traded to Calgary,
and while he played well in his rookie year with the Flames, his
improvement after that was slower. Even as recently as this summer,
he was hardly a national name. "Let's just say you could go a lot of
places, especially in the States, and have no one know you," Iginla
said. Now,  in the most high-profile month of his career, Iginla says
he is ready--and eager to prove he belongs among the league's best.
Just like it says in the newspaper.</TE>

<DH>Bobsledding: Hungarian who survived two bouts with cancer
earns last berth in the Winter Olympics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMY SHIPLEY</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Ildiko Strehli marches in the Opening Ceremonies of the 2002
Winter Games in Salt Lake City on Feb. 8, she plans to carry in her
pocket a list of friends and family members who have supported her.</LD>
<LD>   When the Hungarian makes her first bobsled run 11 days later,
she'll push a used sled she calls the "sled full of hope" with a pink
ribbon--the symbol of breast cancer survivors--painted on the side.</LD>
<LD>   A ski instructor, marathon runner, elite sky diver, former
collegiate swimmer and brown belt in judo, Strehli, 36, is a
relentlessly positive thinker who earned the last Olympic qualifying
slot in women's bobsled just five years after taking up the sport,
and two years after having a double mastectomy in her second bout
with breast cancer.</LD>
<TE>   She received word of her qualification three weeks ago while
dining at a restaurant in Park City, Utah, via a cell phone call from
her husband, Bob Shell. At first disbelieving, Strehli finally
exchanged joyous high-fives and hugs with her dinner companions,
brake woman Eva Kurti and sprint coach Donald Chu.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why I would like to keep the pink ribbon on the sled,"
said Strehli, who moved to the United States after marrying Shell in
1994. "To demonstrate to people not to give up their dreams. I feel
lucky, fortunate, blessed to have come this far."</TE>
<TE>   Two years, six months ago, Strehli noticed a lump on her breast
while on a hike not far from her home in Park City. Days later, in
what provided a devastating flashback to a doctor's visit in 1995,
Strehli learned the lump was malignant. The shock spread slowly. How
could this be happening again? Strehli, who had undergone radiation,
chemotherapy and a lumpectomy after the first appearance of cancer,
this time had both breasts removed.</TE>
<TE>   When women's bobsled was accepted on the Winter Games program in
fall 1999, Strehli was recovering from the surgery. She could not
lift her arms and still had stitches on her chest. Even so, if
women's bobsled had made the Games, Strehli recalled thinking, she,
too, had to make the Games. A month later, still unable to lift her
arms above her head, Strehli re-entered competition on the World Cup
circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "She's stubborn in a very good way," said Shell, who met Strehli
during her four-month trip to the United States in 1993. "She doesn't
know what no means. Ildiko wasn't going to quit. As soon as they said
it was in the Olympics, it was: 'We're going.' She wanted it badly,
and I wanted to help her get it."</TE>
<TE>   Strehli was born in Dorog, a mining town near Budapest, to a
coal-miner father and a hairdresser mother. As a young girl, she
skied on planks of hickory her father cut for her, with attached
rubber straps for her shoes. By age 14, she had been identified as a
prospective talent in athletics by Hungary's then-communist
government. She moved away from her parents' home to attend a special
physical education school in Budapest.</TE>
<TE>   In college, she learned judo and competed in relay events for the
swim team. Introduced to members of Hungary's national sky-diving
team, she was invited to join the squad. She also went to a ski
instructors' camp and earned certification.</TE>
<TE>   A motorcycle accident in 1989 left her with a serious knee injury
and ruined her hopes of making the '92 Olympic team in judo. Strehli
gave up competitive sports and became a high school teacher. In 1993,
eager to improve her English-speaking skills, she traveled to the
U.S., choosing the Washington area because a Hungarian friend had
work there as a baby sitter.</TE>
<TE>   That's when she met Shell, a carpenter and ski instructor, at a
volleyball game. They fell in love. She continued to visit Shell in
Manassas, Va., and eventually moved to join him. Soon after their
marriage in fall 1994, they attended a job fair in Seven Springs,
Pa., and landed positions at a ski resort there.</TE>
<TE>   About six months later, Strehli noticed a pea-sized lump in her
right breast. She ignored it. But by fall 1995, the lump had not
disappeared. Strehli finally saw a doctor, who relayed the bad news:
The lump was malignant. Strehli knew of no history of cancer in her
family. Confused and distressed, she couldn't bear to tell her
parents. Meantime, she continued working full time as a ski
instructor.</TE>
<TE>   As time went on, she lost weight and grew pallid. Her hair fell
out. Certainly, people knew.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to keep my attitude as positive as possible," Strehli
said. "I was looking for jokes, reading success stories, stories of
survival. [But] even if you tried to joke about it, you have to look
in the mirror every day."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the treatment seemed to work. In 1997, she and her husband
moved to Park City, eager to teach skiing on bigger mountains. That
year, she ran a marathon.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, if I can do this, I have nothing to worry about,"
Strehli said. "My body is back to normal."</TE>
<TE>   She and Shell settled happily into life in Park City. One day,
Shell noticed an advertisement in the local paper that sought
foreign-born women to learn the sport of bobsled. Shell urged his
wife to attend the driving school at the new Olympic track nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Strehli went and fell in love with the sport. Those who
successfully completed the program were urged to enter a World Cup
event that was coming to Park City about a month later.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'We've got to do this,'" Shell said. "She had no sled,
no runners, no equipment, not much chance of practicing, and, most of
all, no Hungarian brake woman. But that didn't matter. She was going
to enter the race."</TE>
<TE>   Strehli contacted a Hungarian ski instructor she had known for
years, and who lived in the state of Washington, to be her brake
woman for the race. The ski instructor, Judit Haverty, had never seen
a bobsled and never participated in a sliding sport of any sort.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared for me," Haverty said. "But I said, 'I will do it
for Hungary and for you.' But I told her I am not the athletic type."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Strehli and Shell found an old, ramshackle bobsled "in
somebody's backyard," Shell said. They stayed up until 3 a.m. before
the race, trying to make it safe for the journey down the icy track.</TE>
<TE>   The team finished 13th out of 15 sleds. Haverty hated it; Strehli
was hooked.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to slide as much as possible," Strehli said, "but at the
same time, I already saw the hardship of this sport."</TE>
<TE>   New sleds cost around $40,000 and sponsorships are rare, Strehli
realized she would have to compete without the benefit of the
highest-caliber equipment. During her first year of competition,
sympathetic members of the U.S. team loaned her sleds and runners.
Even so, Strehli and Shell, who continued to work full time as ski
instructors, found themselves deep in debt.</TE>
<TE>   "She's gotten by on borrowed everything," said Chu, the sprint
coach. "I'm surprised she even has her own helmet."</TE>
<TE>   The next summer, Strehli spent $5,000 on a used sled, and $2,500
on old runners. Things were getting serious. But in August 1999, she
found the second lump. This time, she wasted no time in getting to a
doctor. The surgery proved a quicker remedy than chemotherapy and
radiation, but it had other costs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was shorter, but emotionally, it was harder," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Haverty worried about her friend, but she sensed another comeback
underway when the International Olympic Committee announced that
women's bobsled would be in the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   "You could tell how scared she was, and upset," Haverty said.
"Bobsled was really good for her. She could put all her energy into
that, and keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the surgery, Strehli returned to the World Cup circuit,
where she continued to hover at the bottom of the standings. A year
later, she secured sponsorship from Anaheim businessman Patrick
Powers, who already was funding U.S. athletes Todd Hays and Bonny
Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Strehli had shoulder and back surgery but geared up
for the fall season. She knew she had to finish in the top 15 in the
World Cup standings to win a qualifying spot in the Olympic Games.
She and Shell quit their jobs to devote themselves fully to their
Olympic quest.</TE>
<TE>   After an intense season that included crashing during a race in
Germany, Strehli wound up 18th overall in the World Cup standings.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't good enough. Or was it?</TE>
<TE>   Three U.S. teams finished in the top 15, but the United States had
only two Olympic slots. That pushed Strehli to 17th. Germany also had
three top-15 placements, but it could send only two teams. Strehli
was now up to the 16th position. Then, Canada decided to hold good on
its promise not to send a team to Salt Lake City that had failed to
achieve a top-six finish in any World Cup event. That eliminated
Canada's eighth-place team.</TE>
<TE>   Strehli was in the Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   Strehli's goal for the Feb. 19 competition is to put forth the
best race of her life in a sled that is both a vehicle and symbol.</TE>
<TE>   She realizes she is lucky to have made it so far. She was, though,
absolutely determined to be this lucky.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody kind of looks at me as an adopted child," Strehli said.
"They say: 'She's still around. She's been too stubborn to give up.'"</TE>

<HD>It's Been a Good Knight</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Former Indiana coach not taking all the
credit for the Texas Tech turnaround</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON MARKUS</AU>
<BD>THE BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When he heard last spring that Bob Knight was coming out of a
one-season exile to coach at Texas Tech, Andre Emmett was more than a
little skeptical about his own future in Lubbock.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't think I could play for him," Emmett recalled earlier
this week. "I thought my kind of game didn't fit how he coached. But
it's turned out pretty good."</LD>
<LD>   Emmett, who averaged 7.7 points as a freshman last season on a
9-19 team, considered joining an exodus of players--either by choice
or Knight's nudging--after the controversial Hall of Fame coach
arrived in town.</LD>
<TE>   The Red Raiders are one of college basketball's biggest surprises
this season, and Emmett is a main reason. The 6-foot-5, 200-pound
guard is leading Texas Tech (15-4) in scoring with an 18.3-point
average, fourth best in the Big 12 Conference.</TE>
<TE>   But Emmett is clearly not the only reason for Tech's sudden
turnaround from a team that was picked to finish near the bottom of
the conference for a fourth consecutive season to one ranked No. 20
in the nation, the men's basketball team's first Top 25 ranking in
five years.</TE>
<TE>   You could point to senior center Andy Ellis, the league's
fifth-leading scorer at 18.0. Or you could point to junior forward
Kasib Powell and the other three junior college transfers Knight
picked to fill out his depleted roster.</TE>
<TE>   ''Obviously, he's had huge numbers,'' Nebraska Coach Barry Collier
said of Emmett before the Cornhuskers upset Texas Tech, 80-69, in
Lincoln on Wednesday night. ''He's really been consistent for them.
But he's benefited from the excellent play of Andy Ellis and Powell.
There's no question Emmett has had a great year, but you can't stop
there.''</TE>
<TE>   There's also the influence of Knight. He left Indiana under a
cloud 16 months ago for violating a "'zero tolerance" policy on
verbal or physical abuse instituted by university president Miles
Brand, but Knight's resume includes three national titles in
Bloomington and 779 career victories.</TE>
<TE>   While Knight briefly found himself in the eye of another storm
after nearly coming to blows with the manager of the Compaq Center in
Houston after a game there earlier this season, Knight has used his
Good Bob side to charm the fans who keep pouring into the school's
United Spirit Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance has jumped more than 4,000 from last season, to an
average of 13,473. The team's recent win over then-No. 6 Oklahoma
State was its third consecutive sellout at 15,098. The Red Raiders
followed that victory by beating sixth-ranked Oklahoma on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think the 15,000 fans had a little bit to do with
it"said Sooners Coach Kelvin Sampson. "It's not just the team and the
coach; the environment and atmosphere raises the level of play.
That's as tough an environment as we've ever played in."</TE>
<TE>   Former Texas Coach Tom Penders, now an analyst for ESPN, said
recently: "It's gone from a funeral parlor to Mardi Gras."</TE>
<TE>   Knight and his assistants are not taking the credit.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a little surprised at how quickly our guys have picked up
our type of philosophy and teachings," Tech assistant Bob Beyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "They deserve the credit because they worked extremely hard and
they're trying to get a better feel of what we want to get done on
court. To get so many new guys on the same page so quickly, it's
really a compliment to our kids."</TE>
<TE>   Said Emmett: "Playing for Coach Knight has helped me reach my
potential."</TE>
<TE>   Emmett had 26 points and 10 rebounds against Oklahoma after
scoring a career-high 32 in the win over Oklahoma State. Not bad for
a player who was barely recruited out of high school in Dallas.</TE>

<HD>Once-Plodding Stanford Completes Its Makeover</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Quickness at guard and forward could
give Cardinal an edge come tournament time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DECOURCY</AU>
<BD>THE SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a few minutes after Stanford again has claimed Pauley Pavilion
as its own, this time defeating UCLA with feet rather than forearms,
and someone asks Mike Montgomery how it feels to at last coach a team
blessed with speed. This is the sort of question he never heard while
turning the Cardinal into a national power, and yet he is ready with
a smidgen of sweet sarcasm.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess you haven't seen us run wind-sprints," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Montgomery can laugh because his team's perimeter quickness no
longer is laughable. Guard Julius Barnes and forward Josh Childress
have liberated All-American shooting guard Casey Jacobsen and are
delivering the Stanford offense into the era of the dribble drive.</LD>
<TE>   "In the past, they've been a team that liked to slow down the
tempo," says UCLA forward Jason Kapono. "Now, they're starting to
break out of that. They've been known for their big guys, like the
Collins brothers and Mark Madsen. Now, they're breaking down their
plays and going more one-on-one, driving."</TE>
<TE>   For all its astounding success in the previous four years--a Final
Four, three consecutive Pacific 10 Conference titles, two No. 1 NCAA
seedings--Stanford was a team trapped in a bygone era. In the
mid-1990s, the introduction of the 35-second clock caused elite teams
to shift their emphasis from low-post play to breaking down defenses
with the dribble.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford's refusal to bend academic standards made it difficult
for the basketball program to adapt. The coaching staff was able to
sign big-time big men who met the requirements. On the perimeter,
though, the Cardinal had to find ways to win with tall shooters Pete
Sauer and Ryan Mendez rather than with the dynamic athletes that
Duke, Arizona and Michigan State had.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen was only a partial solution to that problem in his first
two years. He instantly became one of the best players in the
school's history, but his jump shot remained his primary weapon. As a
sophomore in 2000-01, he produced 42% of his scoring on
three-pointers. By comparison, Michigan State's Jason Richardson got
just 29.7% of his points on threes.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of this year's Stanford team has changed Jacobsen.
Barnes is a high-flying 6-2 junior who is a bit volatile to be a
full-time point guard, but he can be devastating when playing under
control. New Mexico Coach Fran Fraschilla calls Barnes "probably
their toughest player to guard." Childress is a smooth, 6-8 freshman
who glides to the goal and is dangerous behind the three-point line.</TE>
<TE>   They make it more difficult to double-team Jacobsen. To try is to
risk opening driving lanes. When opponents play straight up, the
Cardinal can spread the floor and give all three players room to
attack the goal. Jacobsen, though still often shooting from long
range, now gets slightly more than a third of his points from behind
the arc.</TE>
<TE>   Even with that improvement, and even with star-quality players in
Jacobsen and 7-foot center Curtis Borchardt, this is not a perfect
team. The point guard situation is too fluid, with Montgomery
alternating Barnes, senior Tony Giovacchini and freshman Chris
Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   In previous years, Stanford almost always had to run plays to
generate scoring opportunities. Few teams executed as proficiently,
but there were no answers when shot-clock pressure developed.</TE>
<TE>   In their victory over UCLA this season, the Cardinal enjoyed a
luxury they never had in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin assistant Jim Saia dedicated his team's defensive game plan
to undermining Stanford's sets, and it worked well enough to generate
a double-digit first-half lead. Montgomery's response was to spread
the court and allow Barnes and Childress to drive the ball at the
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Julius made some really nice athletic plays that some other guys
can't make," Montgomery says. "Josh is a different sort of athlete.
He's pretty quick off his feet, pretty quick in a 10-foot run, but
not very fast as far as changing ends. But he gives us
point-of-attack stuff that we've not had.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's clearly an advantage. Speed and quickness and athleticism
in basketball--it's huge.''</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal's lack of quickness on the perimeter was an issue in
the past three NCAA tournaments, when the team fell short of
justifying its seed each time. As a No. 2 in 1999, Stanford was run
out of the tournament by Gonzaga. A year later, promoted to a No. 1,
the Cardinal was ousted by North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford was a top-seeded team again last year and struggled
against St. Joseph's (Marvin O'Connor drove the Cardinal nuts with 37
points) and Cincinnati (Kenny Satterfield slashed for 24 points and
forced Stanford into a zone). Although Maryland was not a true speed
team, there was no one to keep up with elusive Juan Dixon, who scored
17 points on seven-of-10 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   This season, the Cardinal's athletic renaissance has not yet had
its full effect on the defense.</TE>
<TE>   Childress is not strong enough or experienced enough to become a
force at that end, although his ability to get off his feet and his
long arms occasionally make him an overwhelming rebounder.</TE>
<TE>   "Julius is quick enough to move his feet at the point of attack to
keep his guy from beating him. If you do that, you don't need help,
and it really makes your defense a whole lot better," Montgomery
says. "We have to do a better job with fundamentals.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never been quicker than everybody, historically, and we
probably never will be.''</TE>
<TE>   At the least, Stanford is quicker than before. That's a fair head
start on a more fulfilling tournament run.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: In an era of increasing strikeout rates, teams
use contrasting strategies to try to improve offense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ROSENTHAL</AU>
<BD>THE SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The trade of Jeromy Burnitz intensified an increasingly relevant
baseball debate: How damaging are strikeouts to a team's offensive
performance?</LD>
<LD>   Not that damaging, according to the New York Mets' Steve Phillips,
the general manager who acquired Burnitz.</LD>
<LD>   Very damaging, according to Milwaukee's Dean Taylor, the general
manager who traded the slugger.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't look at strikeouts in a vacuum," Phillips said before
landing Burnitz in a three-team, 11-player deal. "I tend to look at
on-base percentage and slugging percentage rather than strikeouts."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Taylor: "I don't disagree with Steve if you're looking
at one player in an isolated observation. But when you look at the
totality of strikeouts on our club, that's why the Brewers' offense
was dysfunctional last season."</TE>
<TE>   And why the 2002 Mets, with two strikeout-prone sluggers--Burnitz
and Mo Vaughn--and Mike Piazza coming off his highest strikeout total
since 1996, are entering dangerous territory.</TE>
<TE>   Their offense should be balanced enough to succeed with Roger
Cedeno and Roberto Alomar hitting at the top of the lineup and
Edgardo Alfonzo possibly settling between Vaughn and Burnitz. But
high-strikeout teams struggle to manufacture runs. They also are
susceptible to better pitching, particularly in the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers exemplified the perils of an all-or-nothing offense
last season, setting a major-league record with 1,399 strikeouts and
finishing a major-league worst 13-25 in one-run games.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals, a postseason team, didn't click offensively until
they traded Ray Lankford, who struck out 34 times in 65 at-bats with
runners in scoring position before getting sent to the Padres on Aug.
2.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get someone in scoring position and strike out, it does
you no good," Cardinal General Manager Walt Jocketty said. A guy hits
a fly ball or a ground ball, it may give you a chance to move the
runner over or the other team a chance to make a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Sabermetricians, citing research by baseball historian Bill James,
contend the effect of the strikeout is minimal. James found that a
team with a high strikeout rate scores only one fewer run for every
100 extra strikeouts compared with an otherwise similar offensive
team with a low strikeout rate.</TE>
<TE>   Such analysis is critical, for players are striking out like never
before. The NL rate last season--one strikeout every 4.92
at-bats--was the highest in major league history. The AL rate--one
every 5.39 at-bats--was the league's second-highest, after 1997's.</TE>
<TE>   Before 1963, no player had struck out more than 150 times in a
season. Between '63 and '86, there were 34 such seasons. Since '86,
there have been 70, with five of the 12 highest single-season figures
occurring in the past two campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Strikeouts often are part of the package with top sluggers. Jim
Thome, Manny Ramirez and Sammy Sosa each finished in their league's
top 10 last season in both strikeouts and combined on-base/slugging
percentage (OPS).</TE>
<TE>   "It's ultimately about production," A's General Manager Billy
Beane says. "How [players] get to that production is
inconsequential."</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers were unproductive, ranking third in the NL in home
runs but 11th in runs. Taylor likens himself to an offensive
coordinator, implementing a new scheme. His theory is right, his
execution dubious. Of his three additions on offense, neither Eric
Young nor Alex Ochoa is an on-base machine, and the Ochoa-Matt Stairs
platoon in right probably won't make anyone forget Burnitz.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips took the opposite tack, seeking to add power to an
outfield that last season produced a major league-low 40 home runs.
His overhaul of the league's worst offense is impressive. Still,
there are concerns. Burnitz's on-base percentage has dropped the past
two seasons. Vaughn is changing leagues after missing an entire
season due to a ruptured biceps tendon. And Cedeno strikes out too
much for a leadoff man--once every 5.4 at-bats the past three
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Will the Mets' entire season amount to a swing-and-miss? Probably
not. But don't be surprised if this supposed juggernaut sputters.</TE>

<HD>NFL Ready to Turn On the Lights for Playoffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB OATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can, as they say, take this to the bank: The NFL has put on its
last daytime playoff game. From wild-card weekend through the Super
Bowl, they'll all be night games beginning next winter.</LD>
<LD>   The owners of the 32 teams haven't voted on that. It will be
several months before they do. But they're talking it up.</LD>
<LD>   They were "surprised, impressed, and pleased," sources say, by the
artistic success of the blizzard game that started at 8 p.m. on a
freezing Saturday night in a couple of weeks ago when the Patriots
and Oakland Raiders gained a combined 595 yards in a continuous
snowstorm, completing 49 passes for 450 yards.</LD>
<TE>   As the snow kept tumbling down and piling up, the Patriots,
rallying to win, 16-13, completed nine passes in a row in the fourth
quarter and eight of eight in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   A prime-time TV ratings hit, the game attracted many more millions
of viewers than would have watched at noon.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the NFL's owners, with television's strong support, are
thinking about kickoff times of 3:30 or 4 p.m.--instead of 12:30--and
then 7:30 or 8 p.m. for all future playoff games, some perhaps on
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   The two conference title games, always in the past played as a
Sunday TV doubleheader, would be played on Saturday night and Sunday
night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Complete Team</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Rams have taken over this month as a complete
football team, which is more than you can say for the Patriots, which
surely means that in the Super Bowl, they'll take the Patriots down.</TE>
<TE>   As Marshall Faulk ran brilliantly for 159 yards, the Rams, to
eliminate the Philadelphia Eagles last Sunday, 29-24, meshed the
NFL's best rushing game with the NFL's best passing offense and
another helping of clutch defense.</TE>
<TE>   After New England led at the half, 17-13, the Rams ran from behind
to win on Faulk's 31 carries. Meantime, Kurt Warner completed 22 of
33 passes for 212 yards. And Aeneas Williams and Grant Wistrom made
the game-saving defensive plays.</TE>
<TE>   All things considered, of the great NFL teams over the many years,
the Rams seemed the most complete.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Patriots, who could neither run nor pass
consistently, eliminated the Pittsburgh Steelers, 24-17, with one
platoon--their special teams--scoring two of their three touchdowns
on kicking plays.</TE>
<TE>   More exactly, the Patriots did it with one special-team player,
Troy Brown, who doubles as their best wide receiver. First, Brown
carried a punt 55 yards for the first touchdown. Then he picked up a
blocked field goal and built it into a swing of 10 points for New
England in the third quarter by smartly lateraling to fast cornerback
Antwan Harris for the last 49 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Let it be noted, however, that in their two playoff games so far,
the Patriots scored only one touchdown against Oakland and only one
offensive touchdown on the Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody beats the Rams that way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No-Offense Team</TE>
<TE>   The one surprise of this Super Bowl season is simply that the
opportunistic Patriots are in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Against Pittsburgh last week, they might never have scored but for
another run of freak happenings. This time it wasn't a fumble
reversed into an interception after an instant-replay review--the
move that helped them upset Oakland. It was a series of unplanned
events on special-team plays.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, for instance, on a 64-yard punt that
appeared to restrict the Patriots to their 20-yard line, a Pittsburgh
player named Troy Edwards ran out of bounds and returned illegally.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty forced Pittsburgh into a re-kick that was both short
and low as New England's Troy Brown made a spectacular, full-speed
catch and ran to a 55-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, Brown made the heads-up lateral that made
possible the 60-yard touchdown that had begun as a Steeler field-goal
attempt. How often does a good NFL team suffer a blocked field goal?</TE>
<TE>   How often does the ball roll into position where an opposing
player--even one as alert as Troy Brown--can pick it up on a
favorable bounce? How often does the guy lateral it to anyone for the
game's key touchdown?</TE>
<TE>   To be fair to Troy Brown, he doubtless is, as he seemed to be, an
exceptional athlete--a player to keep track of in today's game.
Individually, he not only led every wide receiver in both games last
Sunday--with eight catches for 121 yards--he made the big catch on
New England's only touchdown drive.</TE>
<TE>   On third and eight, two minutes before the half, Brown kept that
drive alive when he came open 28 yards down the field, where
quarterback Tom Brady saw him and threw for a first down at the
Pittsburgh 40.</TE>
<TE>   That was a fate-filled play, the one that ended Brady's game when,
with a late hit, Pittsburgh safety Lee Flowers illegally attacked him
below the knees.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second big dirty play of the playoff season.</TE>
<TE>   Following a cleanly played regular season--in which the NFL's most
aggressive defensive players were held in line by the heavy fines
ordered by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue--a Philadelphia defensive end
named Hugh Douglas set a precedent for Flowers in the second playoff
round at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Illegally attacking Bear quarterback Jim Miller, Douglas knocked
him out of the game, insuring a Philadelphia victory and drawing a
$35,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers' attack on Brady had one unforeseen consequence, bringing
Patriot quarterback Drew Bledsoe back from the dead.</TE>
<TE>   On his first four plays, Bledsoe threw four passes, completing
three to wide receiver David Patten, the last for 11 yards and the
touchdown that elevated the upstart Patriots into a hard-to-believe
14-3 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, however, Patriot fans saw why Coach Bill
Belichick (who was 5-11 last seasonas the successor to USC's Pete
Carroll) benched Bledsoe this season in favor of the younger,
less-experienced Brady.</TE>
<TE>   As the wily Pittsburgh defense controlled Bledsoe most of the
time, he led the New England offense to only three points in the last
30 minutes and threw only one good pass, an ideal third-and-10 lob
to, you guessed it, Troy Brown.</TE>
<TE>   New England's was, in truth, a one-man triumph for Brown, without
whom the Patriots would be vacationing now while Pittsburgh Coach
Bill Cowher put the finishing touches on his sideline scowl for the
Super Bowl.</TE>

<DH>Now-retired volunteer 'Grandma' Hamilton made an indelible
mark at the Foundation for the Junior Blind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gladys Hamilton is called "Grandma" by people who aren't even family.
In fact, she has no grandchildren, not even children. But she says
her best years were spent working as a nanny and a volunteer with her
"babies."</LD>
<LD>   At 91, though, it's getting hard for her to keep up with kids.
After 14 years of taking two buses each way to volunteer on weekdays
at the Foundation for the Junior Blind in Windsor Hills, last year
Hamilton had to stop. Her eyes were clouded over with cataracts and
glaucoma, and she had to use a walker to get around. So she stayed
home and watched game shows on TV.</LD>
<LD>   But one recent Friday a foundation employee offered her a ride and
a rare chance to visit the children with whom she spent so much time.
She had to stay home from a National Philanthropy Day ceremony in
November, when she was named outstanding volunteer, but she wasn't
going to miss this.</LD>
<TE>   "I miss y'all," said Hamilton, a New Orleans native with a raspy
voice, during her visit. She hugged Mark Vrbka, director of the
foundation's Special Education School, where Hamilton volunteered as
a foster grandparent.</TE>
<TE>   "We miss you too, Grandma," Vrbka said.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation offers education, recreation and rehabilitation
programs to visually impaired children from California and
neighboring states. Hamilton had not been there since she was honored
with the school's Volunteer of the Year Award in May. She said
arthritis made her knee weak, causing her to use the walker, which
was not allowed at the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for my leg," she said, "I'd be here."</TE>
<TE>   Vrbka knows it. "Rain, sleet, whatever it was, Grandma was here,"
he said. "Even when we advised her not to come, she was here during
the El Nino and when the streets were flooded."</TE>
<TE>   And she had a 45-minute bus trip from her home near the Coliseum
to get there. Hamilton took the No. 81 down Figueroa Street and the
No. 108 across Slauson Avenue, then walked half a mile up Angeles
Vista Boulevard to the foundation. Friends say Hamilton often turned
down rides home, opting to find her own way.</TE>
<TE>   The Special Education School instructs 3- to 21-year-olds who are
visually impaired and developmentally disabled. None of them can
speak. Hamilton supervised their arts and activity time.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, the work was not hard," she said. "It was just a
joy."</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton worked with one child in particular--20-year-old Anna
Lisa.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Lisa has Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a congenital condition
that delays development and whose symptoms include small stature,
eyebrows that meet in the middle of the forehead, bowel abnormalities
and missing limbs or portions of limbs like fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Vrbka said Anna Lisa was a "classic case." Still, that didn't stop
Hamilton from giving her all the love she had.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandma just always had a way of looking past the kids'
disability," Vrbka said.</TE>
<TE>   As Hamilton rolled her walker from the foundation's main building
toward the activity room where the children were playing, her hair
shone in the sunlight like sterling silver and her smile matched the
maroon dress she wore. Even her gray eyes seemed bright until Vrbka
told her some bad news.</TE>
<TE>   She wouldn't be able to see Anna Lisa, because she was in the
hospital having stomach surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton stopped walking; her eyes focused on the ground. "That
smile. She would've known me," she said, clearly disappointed. "I
miss my baby's smile." Hamilton kept on anyway. At least she'd be
able to see some of the children.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton became a foster grandmother after a lifetime of working
as a live-in housekeeper. She had started young, working at 18 for a
couple with a young son in New Orleans. She was the one who brought
the couple's second son home from the hospital when he was born and
practically raised him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had an urge to work with children," Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   She and her ex-husband tried to have kids, she said, but weren't
successful. They divorced after eight years.</TE>
<TE>   When she moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s, she did more
housekeeping for families and eventually retired. But, Hamilton said,
"I was bored."</TE>
<TE>   So in her 70s she started looking for good ways to spend her time.
She heard about the national Foster Grandparent Program and quickly
signed up.</TE>
<TE>   Foster grandmother Darlene Murray, 85, said it was easy to see how
much Hamilton loved the children by her patience with them and how
she spoiled them with home-cooked sweets.</TE>
<TE>   "She was always so pleasant and sweet to all the children," Murray
said. "I try to be like that too. Like another Gladys."</TE>
<TE>   Murray said there is a definite void without Hamilton around,
which she continually tries to fill. "I think about her all the time
when I sit in that rocking chair," she said. Murray remembers walking
by Hamilton's classroom, watching the way Grandma Gladys used to rock
a child on her lap in the wooden chair.</TE>
<TE>   And staff members remember her every time they pass the
poster-size black-and-white photograph that hangs on the school's
wall of Hamilton and Jimmy, a boy she used to work with, playing the
piano. Many of the children love to play on the piano, Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   As she sat in the activity room on her visiting day, she kept
glancing over her shoulder at the girl who pressed the piano's keys.</TE>
<TE>   "That sounds like Anna," Hamilton said turning her head. "I
thought that was Anna," she said, realizing it was not.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton's other love is working with young children at her
church, Greater New Bethel Baptist in Inglewood. She's been running
the nursery on Sundays for 26 years, and the chairman of the board of
trustees, Dan Smith, said, "She does an excellent job."</TE>
<TE>   She used to bake 300 to 400 chocolate chip and coconut cookies for
the church to take to the homeless downtown every month but hasn't
been able to lately. And she hasn't been at the nursery the past few
weeks, either.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids love her," Smith said. "They just crowd around her and
they don't run wild on her."</TE>
<TE>   When Hamilton knew she wasn't returning to the foundation, Murray
said she called her with a request.</TE>
<TE>   "Take care of my babies," she said.</TE>

<HD>Ocean Monitors Call for New Safety Tools</HD>
<DH>Health: Scientists who  watch for beach contamination need
faster, more reliable tests. Experts are gathering in Irvine to swap
ideas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a tough job, trying to keep the public safe from ocean water
contaminated with human waste. Even though Southern California
counties test the water regularly and put out daily alerts about
which beaches are unsafe, the tests themselves are imperfect and
outdated by the time word gets out.</LD>
<LD>   But scientists locally and nationwide are developing better,
faster and cheaper monitoring methods. In fact, the question of how
best to test the water is such a hot topic that 200 experts from
around the nation will gather this week in Irvine to discuss it.
Massachusetts researchers are experimenting with caffeine as a
universal sewage warning indicator in a coffee- and cola-happy
culture. A University of Michigan professor is trying to develop a
test with a half-hour turnaround time. UC Irvine scientists are
experimenting with a variety of viruses and other indicators.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting could hardly take place in a more appropriate
location. The water-quality testing that occurs in coastal Southern
California equals all of the monitoring in the rest of the nation
combined.</LD>
<TE>   "California has one of the most forward-looking programs in water
quality of any of the states," said Al Dufour, a senior research
microbiologist at the EPA's National Exposure Research Laboratory in
Cincinnati. Dufour has studied this issue since the 1970s. "They try
to get news to the public about water quality as rapidly as possible
and they're continuing to find better ways to research health
effects."</TE>
<TE>   Coastal counties started testing in earnest nearly three years
ago, when new state regulations went into effect. The rules require
county health officials to warn the public when bacteria levels
exceed thresholds. The impetus for the 1997 bill came in 1996, when a
Santa Monica Bay study found for the first time that polluted runoff
from storm drains was making swimmers and surfers sick.</TE>
<TE>   But health officials don't actually look for viruses and other
disease-causing organisms, because that would require tests that are
both costly and cumbersome. Instead they test for bacteria that
indicate the presence of sewage. These so-called indicator bacteria
are found in human intestines, but also in other warm-blooded mammals
and birds, meaning that their presence does not always mean human
waste is present.</TE>
<TE>   At times, those bacteria cannot be detected even when the water is
contaminated. At such times, tests would falsely indicate that the
water is safe. But the biggest shortcoming of current tests is the
24-hour lag time between testing and results, not to mention the time
to get the samples to labs and to post warnings.</TE>
<TE>   Swimmers could unknowingly enter tainted waters, or beaches could
be needlessly posted with warning signs, hurting coastal communities'
economies.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be almost two full beach days before any health warning
signs are posted. That to me is the biggest concern," said Mark Gold,
executive director of the environmental group Heal the Bay, based in
Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Kiff, assistant city manager of Newport Beach, agreed.
"People swim in the water when it's dirty and don't swim when it's
clean. That's my biggest frustration with indicator bacteria. All
that said, it's the best [test] we have so far."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the state awarded the Southern California
Coastal Water Research Project, a group funded by the EPA and the
region's sanitation agencies, a $1.5-million contract to develop a
rapid indicator test. Stephen B. Weisberg, executive director of the
Westminster-based agency, hopes researchers can use methods developed
for other industries to create such a test for coastal waters.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to build onto what has been developed for other
types of bacteria in other fields--the hospital industry, the
drinking water industry, food service. They all work on rapid
indicators," Weisberg said. "We're hoping to glom on to those."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers agree it would be unwieldy and prohibitively expensive
to test for every human bacterium and virus in the water. "It's
better to use a broad-brush approach and look for indicators rather
than specific pathogens," said Charles McGee, a microbiologist with
the Orange County Sanitation District, which monitors the beach at 20
spots near its plant.</TE>
<TE>   The perfect indicator would be one present wherever there are
disease-causing organisms. It would be unable to grow in the water,
so scientists could get an accurate count. It would not die out
easily. Laboratory workers would find it easy to measure. It would be
found only in sewage.</TE>
<TE>   The list of requirements goes on. And no one indicator does it
all.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the state picked three bacteria--total coliform, fecal
coliform and enterococcus--as the indicators.</TE>
<TE>   But scientists acknowledge that these three are imperfect.
Bacteria die off quickly, making the water seem safe, while many
types of viruses survive for weeks in cool ocean water.</TE>
<TE>   Recent research by UC Irvine professor Sunny Jiang showed that
ocean water that tests negative for bacteria still sometimes harbors
viruses. Jiang is evaluating other indicators, including human
viruses.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang is among the speakers scheduled to appear at the Tuesday
meeting, which is sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, the State Water Resources Control Board, the National Water
Research Foundation and the Southern California Coastal Water
Research Project.</TE>
<TE>   "Coastal water is a big thing to me," she said. "A lot of people
in California really care about coastal water. It's a hot topic,
research wise. There are a lot of interesting questions to be
answered and interesting research to do as well."</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers are looking to solve another common problem:
It's impossible to know whether the indicator bacteria come from
human or animal waste. Although the link between human sewage and
illness is clear, there has been little study of whether animal waste
makes people sick. Animal waste often reaches the ocean via urban
runoff--the fertilizer, pet droppings and other contaminants that
wash off streets and lawns and into storm drains that flow into the
ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The inability to differentiate between human and animal sources,
coupled with the 24-hour lag time for results, makes tracking the
source of pollution more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Weisberg said, "We want to be able to warn the people when a
[sewage] spill event occurs, and we want to track it upstream--we
want to know where it came from. Twenty-four hours later, the source
is gone."</TE>
<TE>   Had such technology existed during the Huntington Beach shoreline
closures in the summer of 1999, researchers would likely have had
more success in finding its origin.</TE>
<TE>   Genetic research involving DNA and RNA may one day allow for easy
and fast identification of the source of bacteria, whether it is
human sewage, a dog park, birds in a marsh or dairy cows in Chino.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a little bit of frustration on my part that we
could indeed be closing the beach because of bird
droppings--something that is in the environment anyway," said Kiff,
the Newport Beach administrator. "I would love to be able to address
a beach closure, and know the source of contamination and be able to
go right back and stop the contamination right now."</TE>

<PH>SUPER BOWL XXXVI / NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS VS. ST. LOUIS RAMS</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Ram Battle Is Historic</HD>
<DH>Game: A victory over Patriots would intensify debate over
how the heavily favored Rams stack up against the best teams of all
time in the NFL.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>This isn't a Super Bowl, it's a coronation.</LD>
<LD>   The real intrigue last week wasn't whether Tom Brady or Drew
Bledsoe would start at quarterback for the New England Patriots today
in Super Bowl XXXVI. It was whether the St. Louis Rams, the belle of
the bowl, was the most complete team in NFL history.</LD>
<LD>   Kurt Warner and Co., favored by two touchdowns, have only
themselves to blame for their two losses this season. They had eight
turnovers in a loss to New Orleans, and six in a loss to Tampa Bay.</LD>
<TE>   "It's tough to say whether you can be a dynasty in this day and
age with free agency," said quarterback Warner, on the verge of his
second Super Bowl title in three seasons. "But I think we're in great
position."</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the way are the Patriots, who overcame a 1-3 start to
win 12 of their last 14 games--including their last eight. The
starting quarterback job goes to Brady, who sprained his left ankle
in the first half of the AFC championship game last Sunday at
Pittsburgh. Bledsoe, the $107-million backup, will be waiting in the
wings.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, the Patriots feel right at home. The whole town is
bathed in red, white and blue, including the Superdome, illuminated
in those colors all week. The game was postponed a week in the wake
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the Super Bowl logo was
changed to an American-flag-striped outline of the United States.
Security is at all-time high, and the pregame and halftime shows will
reflect the mood of the country. Four of the five living former U.S.
presidents--Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George Bush and Bill
Clinton--will be in attendance. President George W. Bush considered
coming, but his office informed league officials Tuesday that he
would be unable to make it.</TE>
<TE>   The matchup between St. Louis and New England, NFL Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue said, is a game between "middle America, which
epitomizes America's values, versus the birthplace of America's
values."</TE>
<TE>   Warner directs an offense that has led the league in yards the
last three seasons. And although he was chosen the NFL's most
valuable player, he wasn't the league's offensive player of the year.
That honor went to teammate Marshall Faulk, the first player in NFL
history to gain 2,000 yards from scrimmage in four consecutive
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes, then there are the supersonic Ram receivers, fast enough
to leave vapor trails.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got a lot of thoroughbreds," Patriot safety Lawyer Milloy
said upon arrival in New Orleans. "It's going to be a week where
we'll probably eat a lot of salads instead of steaks to try to stay
light."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots took a buffet-line approach to building their team.
Since Coach Bill Belichick and General Manager Scott Pioli took over
in January 2000, they have brought in 20 veteran free agents who are
still with the team. They rummaged through the bargain bin for such
players as guard Joe Andruzzi, receiver David Patten, defensive end
Anthony Pleasant, running backs Antowain Smith and Marc Edwards, and
linebackers Bryan Cox and Roman Phifer, all key additions.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Belichick knows the game and has been around for a while,"
said Phifer, a former UCLA standout. "I'm sure that he knows talent
when he sees it."</TE>
<TE>   And Belichick, who has been a defensive assistant coach on three
Super Bowl teams, sees a Ram offense teeming with talent. The only
team with comparable speed, in his eyes, was the 1980 San Diego
Chargers, with players such as Charlie Joiner and Kellen Winslow.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about the Rams is they bring guys off the bench who are
just as fast, or faster, than the guys out there," Belichick said.</TE>
<TE>   Most dangerous is Faulk, who can line up just about anywhere and
is among the league's most difficult players to bring down. He was
the NFL's most valuable player in 2000 and the league's offensive
player of the year the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, he broke his string of ho-hum playoff performances with
a 159-yard rushing effort against Philadelphia. All that, and he's
playing the Super Bowl in his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk thinks the Rams are not only playing the Patriots, they're
playing for their place in the annals of NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's what excellence is, that's what we're trying to
achieve," he said. "That's what we do. We hold a standard of high
achievement. We try to be perfect in everything we do."</TE>
<TE>   History awaits, and so do the Patriots, who vow to make a game of
it. And maybe more.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way we're going to gain respect is to win the whole
thing," Milloy said. "That's the bottom line."</TE>

<HD>Temple Theft Reveals a Gambler's Sad Saga</HD>
<DH>Crime: Ex-bookkeeper, accused of embezzling $100,000, tells
of financial desperation. Some say synagogue audit was needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For two days, Doina Stanescu exchanged haunting phone messages with a
Redondo Beach police detective.</LD>
<LD>   She set the rules in her first message to Det. Rick Kochheim: They
would communicate only by voice mail. She would not reveal where she
was hiding.</LD>
<LD>   The calls were grim. Kochheim said Stanescu, a bookkeeper,
suggested that she might surrender but "only if she failed to take
her own life."</LD>
<TE>   But she did turn herself in Jan. 22 and now sits in jail, facing
charges of embezzling nearly $100,000 from Temple Menorah in Redondo
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Public records and interviews with police and Stanescu's former
co-workers paint a picture of a woman who optimistically arrived in
the United States with her husband, Marin, from Romania more than
three decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Stanescu could not be reached for comment, and her attorney,
Deputy Public Defender John Gorelli, declined to speak about the
case.</TE>
<TE>   But Stanescu's life entered a more desperate period after a 1989
divorce, a time that was marked by continuing financial troubles.</TE>
<TE>   During the divorce process, she failed to reply to court requests
for financial information that would have been used to assess
potential alimony.</TE>
<TE>   Because she didn't respond, documents show, no alimony was
ordered.</TE>
<TE>   It was during this time, Stanescu would tell temple co-workers
years later, that she began making steady trips to gamble in Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   By 1991, she had filed for bankruptcy. Court records listed assets
of $2,600 and liabilities totaling $25,407. By 1995, however, she was
still in trouble, unable to pay $645 of her state taxes.</TE>
<TE>   When Stanescu became the temple's bookkeeper about a year and a
half ago, nobody there knew of her financial troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Co-workers said Stanescu, 51, appeared extremely able and
authoritative at her work. On a personal level, she was friendly, if
a little bit moody, and a heavy smoker.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after she started working at the synagogue, prosecutors
said, Stanescu went to the temple's computer and printed checks made
in her own name, forging the signatures of her supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, some temple members had been questioning how the
synagogue managed its finances in recent years. Ron Maroko, a former
temple board member, said he had complained for years that the books
had not been audited. He said he resigned from the board last summer
to protest the lack of an audit, which he said hadn't been conducted
since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "This all could have been avoided if the temple had audited its
books," Kochheim said.</TE>
<TE>   Request to See the Books Rebuffed</TE>
<TE>   Maroko said he asked to see the books in October but was told by
Stanescu that some records still had to be compiled. He later made an
appointment to see the books but said Stanescu called in sick that
day so the meeting was postponed.</TE>
<TE>   Maroko made another appointment, this time for Jan. 18, the day
Stanescu didn't show up for work and left phone messages for staffers
saying she wasn't coming back.</TE>
<TE>   A letter arrived at the synagogue the next day, police and temple
staffers said, in which Stanescu admitted embezzling nearly $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Stanescu talked about her addiction to gambling and her father's
ailing health and rising medical expenses in Romania. She said she
was "so overcome with guilt that she couldn't live anymore,"
according to Kochheim.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no way of verifying her story about the father," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the suicide threat, police went to Stanescu's Long
Beach apartment. She wasn't there.</TE>
<TE>   Police said she later called the temple to set a time to turn
herself in. When she failed to show up, Kochheim called her cell
phone and left messages urging her to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Stanescu called back, he said, and set out the rules for the
exchanges that would follow. He called three times; she called back
twice, finally agreeing to turn herself in.</TE>
<TE>   It ended Jan. 22 when friends dropped her off at the Redondo Beach
police station and she began to tearfully face four counts of
forgery--since police say she signed at least four checks to
herself--and a count each of embezzlement and grand theft, all
felonies.</TE>
<TE>   She has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is being held at the
Twin Towers Correctional Facility north of downtown Los Angeles in
lieu of $125,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the time she discussed suicide or surrender through
phone messages with the detective, she continued to gamble all the
money she had left, losing everything, Kochheim said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the synagogue is facing a $50,000 budget shortfall,
according to a letter to the congregation from President Margy
Feldman.</TE>
<TE>   Some temple members, like Maroko, also wonder whether regular
audits might have prevented any problems.</TE>
<TE>   Anger at Leadership of Temple Reported</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to a lot of congregation members since the
embezzlement, and many are upset and angry at the leadership of
Temple Menorah," said Eliot Krieger, a member of the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, the focus of the conversations I've had has not been
about [Stanescu], but has been about the atmosphere created by the
leadership that allowed her to embezzle the money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman acknowledges the controversy but would not discuss the
issue further during an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very protective of my congregation and professional staff,"
she said. "It's all of us who are responsible for this. That's the
stand I'm taking."</TE>
<TE>   Feldman said that a healing service is being planned to help
temple members come to terms with the recent events but that no date
has been set.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel worried and sad for [Stanescu]," she said. "Yeah, I guess
I forgive Doina."</TE>

<HD>16 Chinese Discovered in Cargo Container</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixteen Chinese men and teenage boys were discovered Saturday morning
in a cargo container at the Port of Long Beach, immigration
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The men were in "relatively good condition," said Tom Graber, area
port director for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
The INS arrested all 16 stowaways, two of whom said they were minors.
They are being held at the INS processing center on Terminal Island.</LD>
<LD>   The stowaways were found before 11 a.m. in a commercial cargo
container on a boat run by China Ocean Shipping Company, or COSCO.
They had been inside the container since Jan. 19, when the ship left
mainland China, with stops in Hong Kong and Japan.</LD>
<TE>   Acting on a tip, immigration and Customs officials were at the
port when the ship arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "We suspected there might be some Chinese being smuggled in a
container," Graber said. "So we were there in full force."</TE>
<TE>   This is the second incident in a week in which Chinese men were
found at the port. On Jan. 27, immigration officials arrested four
men who were seen wandering around the dock area.</TE>
<TE>   The men had also hidden in a container on a COSCO ship during a
trip from China, authorities said. An investigation showed that 11
others had escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Graber said there was no evidence of cooperation in the smuggling
by the shipping company.</TE>
<TE>   INS authorities say there has been a wave of illegal Chinese
migrants making their way to the West Coast in the past few years.</TE>
<TE>   In one highly publicized incident in January 2000, three Chinese
stowaways were found dead inside a 40-foot cargo container aboard a
ship at the Port of Seattle. Fifteen others emerged from the
container malnourished and dehydrated.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into Saturday's incident is continuing. The
Chinese nationals will probably be taken to Mira Loma Detention
Center in Lancaster to await hearings. Some may be eligible for
political asylum.</TE>

<HD>Proposal Calls for Giving a 5th Council District to Valley</HD>
<DH>Redistricting: The plan would eliminate a Westside seat and
give Latino voters a plurality in five areas. Four hearings are
scheduled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Setting up a conflict between two veteran City Council members, a
committee on Saturday approved a preliminary plan to redraw council
boundaries, combining parts of two Westside districts and creating
another one in the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The plan for realigning the 15 council districts would increase
the number of seats where Latinos constitute a plurality of voters
from four to five, with the new one in the East Valley. Latinos would
average 47% of the registered voters in the five districts.</LD>
<LD>   The map would increase from four to five the number of council
districts wholly in the Valley and maintain a plurality of African
American voters in three districts.</LD>
<TE>   City Council boundaries are redrawn after the census every 10
years to reflect population changes. The Los Angeles Redistricting
Commission, whose 21 members are appointed by the city's elected
officials, is responsible for recommending a map drawn up by experts
it hires.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman John Emerson said the commission will hold four public
hearings this month before recommending a final map to the City
Council by March 1. The council then has until July 1 to adopt new
districts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a draft map. It's going out for the purpose of throwing
tomatoes at it," Emerson said after it sparked immediate controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest dispute: The map merges parts of Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski's 11th District with Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's 6th
District into a coastal district that extends south from Pacific
Palisades to Los Angeles International Airport. Population in the two
districts did not grow as quickly as in parts of the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The panel, however, delayed a decision on which of the two
officials would get the new coastal district and which would have to
represent a new East Valley district for the remainder of her term.
Galanter cannot run for reelection in 2003 because of term limits and
Miscikowski must leave office in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski, whose current district extends from the Westside into
the West Valley, said the council might have to revise the map so
that no council member loses his or her district.</TE>
<TE>   "What does it say to the voters when you have someone representing
an area where they were never elected?" asked Miscikowski, a
Brentwood resident.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter, a Venice resident, wants to represent the coastal
district because a majority of it lies in her old district, said Leah
Wyman, an aide.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be unfair to people in the coastal district to have a
representative who doesn't understand that area," Wyman said.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Steve Afriat, appointed by Galanter, proposed that
the coastal district become the 6th District represented by Galanter
and that the new Valley district be assigned to Miscikowski.</TE>
<TE>   But the commission voted 19 to 1 to put off assigning numbers, and
therefore incumbents, to the coastal and valley districts until after
public hearings are held.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson, appointed by Miscikowski, said he wants to leave the
decision to the City Council, which has final say in adopting new
districts.</TE>
<TE>   Afriat called it "the decision so tough that no one wants to make
it," and chided his fellow commissioners for punting.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding the number of council districts contained wholly in the
Valley from four to five was a major goal of the commission, in
recognition of the large growth in population in the Valley.
Currently, four districts are wholly in the Valley and three others
extend from the Valley to areas south of Mulholland Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Because the East Valley's 2nd District seat has been vacant since
Councilman Joel Wachs resigned, the commission used it to create the
fifth Valley district, splitting the 2nd in two.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson said he wants to wait and let the council decide which of
the two districts is designated "Council District 2" until after a
March 5 election to fill the seat.</TE>
<TE>   "If you number them now, you would be meddling in that election,"
Emerson said, adding that residents left outside the new district
boundaries might not feel the need to vote in the election,
potentially changing the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   After five all-Valley districts are created, about 120,000
residents of Sherman Oaks and Studio City are left over.</TE>
<TE>   The commission decided to put about 71,000 of them into a redrawn
5th District, most of which is south of Mulholland on the Westside.
The rest of the Valley voters were put into the 4th District, which
extends south of Mulholland to Hollywood and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley
VOTE, tried to put all the 120,000 remaining Valley residents into
the 5th District, so that district would have a good chance of
electing a Valley resident. Close's plan was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Another battlefront was opened over downtown, one that pitted
Latino and African American leaders against each other.</TE>
<TE>   The commission left much of downtown, including City Hall, the
skyscrapers of Bunker Hill, and the fashion and jewelry districts, in
the 9th District, represented by Councilwoman Jan Perry.</TE>
<TE>   That despite the fact that Councilman Nick Pacheco lobbied hard
for the area east of Grand Avenue, which includes City Hall, Little
Tokyo and the economically thriving Fashion District, to be
transferred to his 14th District, which includes Boyle Heights and
areas to the east. He also wants the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels in his district.</TE>
<TE>   Perry called Pacheco's move a "power grab" and said she supports
the map for keeping the boundaries of her district relatively intact.</TE>

<PH>SUPER BOWL XXXVI / NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS VS. ST. LOUIS RAMS</PH>
<KH>The Inside Track to Super Bowl XXXVI</KH>
<HD>Harrah Was Never Paid the $500 for His Feat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty-two years ago, with the Los Angeles Rams set to face the
favored Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XIV at the Rose Bowl, Ram
guard Dennis Harrah thought he saw a golden opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   Although he had a shoe contract with Converse, Harrah accepted a
bag of Nike gear and agreed to wear the company's swoosh symbol
during the game for $500.</LD>
<LD>   Later, Harrah struck a similar deal with Pony shoes.</LD>
<TE>   Because he always had trainers tape over his cleats, the shoes
weren't visible anyway. So Harrah thought he had an ingenious plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the trainer paint the Nike symbol on one side of the shoe,
and the Pony symbol on the other side, with the Converse symbol on
the shoe flap," Harrah said.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a problem until there was a photo of me in Sports
Illustrated showing all three. Then I was caught in the middle of a
lawsuit between Nike and Pony. And I never got a check from either of
them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is that good or bad? In one of the more unusual statistics, New
England is 8-1 since 1998 when the opposing quarterback throws for
300 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the loss was to the Rams this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Nice Guy: Kim Herring was part of the Ravens' dominating
defense a year ago. He's part of the Rams' resuscitated defense this
year.</TE>
<TE>   That's where any similarities-- style, substance or volume--end.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the national media portrayed the brash-talking Ravens
as bad guys. This year, the same folks are portraying the Rams as
good guys.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a little different," Herring told the Baltimore Sun.
"Last year we were considered everybody's worst enemy, for whatever
reason. But this year, we're considered goody-two-shoes, so to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were the bad guys, I don't consider myself a bad guy. My
mom still loves me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Special genes: Jeff Jacobs of the Hartford Courant on Patriot
kicker Adam Vinatieri: "In the age-old debate whether great special
teams players are made or just born that way, the Patriot kicker is
Exhibit A for nature over nurture.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in his blood. It's in his genes. It's in his DNA. Adam
Vinatieri's great-great grandfather was the ultimate special teams
player.</TE>
<TE>   "Felix Villiet Vinatieri was the bandmaster for Gen. George
Armstrong Custer's Seventh Regiment of Cavalry. And if that position
doesn't define special teams play, what in the world does?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Memories: Fox's Cris Collinsworth, a member of the Cincinnati
Bengal team that lost Super Bowl XVI to the San Francisco 49ers: "We
got stuck in traffic in Pontiac [Mich.]. We got to the game an hour
and a half before kickoff and we had a fistfight in the locker room
over who was going to get taped. We came out and played just about
the way we arrived. We were down, 20-0, and it was pretty much over."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Ram tight end Ernie Conwell on Coach Mike Martz, who
took over a Super Bowl winner from Dick Vermeil: "It's like if you
got promoted up through a system, and people knew you as the janitor,
and then as the facility manager, and then as an assistant, and then,
all of a sudden, you're the president.</TE>
<TE>   "There might not be as much respect there. People might not
appreciate you as much, because they've known you a long time, and
known you through those phases."</TE>

<DH>The Game May Be in New Orleans, but for Many the Real
Action Is in Vegas, Where Point Spread Is Set and Fortunes Are Won or
Lost</DH>

<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>The hotel rooms are sold out, the slot machines are singing, the high
rollers are rolling and the buzz is in the air. Nothing invigorates
the Strip like a big event, and the Super Bowl is the biggest of them
all.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that the game is being played 1,500 miles away in New
Orleans. For the millions who will bet up to an estimated $1 billion
worldwide, this is where the action is, this is where it starts with
the point spread. With the exception of the St. Louis Rams and the
New England Patriots themselves, this is where the big players
congregate.</LD>
<LD>   And ultimately, this is where fortunes can be won or lost.</LD>
<TE>   A look at the countdown to kickoff:</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, Jan. 27</TE>
<TE>   It sits far removed from the glittering edifices of the Las Vegas
skyline, on the other side of McCarran International Airport, a dull,
gray, three-story building looking no different than thousands of
others in industrial parks all across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as the NFC title game between the Rams and the Philadelphia
Eagles dwindles to its final few minutes, all eyes in those gambling
palaces down the road are on this drab structure.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, in the second-floor offices of Las Vegas Sports
Consultants, four men--Cesar Robaina, Mike Seba, Tom Vanderhoof and
Eugene Buonantony--gather around a table to hammer out a final figure
that will reverberate through the sports and gambling world over the
next seven days.</TE>
<TE>   It's called the line, the spread, the odds, the perfect number, a
prediction not only of which team will win the game, but by how much.</TE>
<TE>   Robaina is the odds manager at Las Vegas Sports Consultants. The
company employs 14 oddsmakers, who zero in on the sports they know
best. A crew of six from that group is put together for baseball, six
for the NBA, five for college basketball. Seba, Vanderhoof and
Buonantony are his pro football specialists.</TE>
<TE>   The oddsmakers are licensed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.
Each must undergo an extensive security check to ensure they have no
criminal past or ties to illegal gambling.</TE>
<TE>   To come up with a line, each oddsmaker uses his own resources,
which can range from detailed statistical breakdowns to impressions
of team chemistry to personal contacts to gut instincts.</TE>
<TE>   In Robaina's mind, the most important factors for a team are its
running game, its defense and the frequency with which it turns the
ball over. But, he estimates, 35% of his final figure is based on
intuition after analyzing the data.</TE>
<TE>   There is urgency on this Sunday to get the line out to Sports
Consultants' 75 paying clients, who range from 85% of the Las Vegas
sports books to the offshore betting casinos in the Caribbean to
gambling outlets in nine other countries. Increasingly, there is
competition.</TE>
<TE>   The race to be first is not just a matter of honor--it's a matter
of money. A smart bettor will shop around.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want people to migrate to another number before they see
our opinion," says Pete Korner, operations manager.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always had the reputation of being the line originator,"
says Tony Sinisi, a Sports Consultants oddsmaker. "What has happened
is that the offshore casinos put out their own numbers now. God bless
them, but we have a history doing this and we want our opinion out
early so that people will know it is our true number."</TE>
<TE>   On this Sunday, the four oddsmakers meet in a room anchored by a
bank of televisions tuned to sports channels, several computer
screens ready to crunch numbers and reams of statistical analysis on
the teams headed to the Super Bowl. The only clue as to the true
nature of the business is a pair of framed movie posters: one is "The
Basketball Fix," the other, "The Day the Bookies Wept."</TE>
<TE>   The four agree without question that the Rams must be favored.</TE>
<TE>   But by how much?</TE>
<TE>   Seba says 13 points, Vanderhoof 14, Robaina 141/2, Buonantony 16
to 17.</TE>
<TE>   Robaina, who has the final say, decides on 16.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we knew [New England quarterback Tom] Brady was injured and
we know more people will bet on the favorite," says Sports
Consultants oddsmaker Dan O'Brien, "if we have erred, it is on the
high side."</TE>
<TE>   The line has been set and, within minutes, it spreads around the
world through the conveniences of electronic technology.</TE>
<TE>   This is the yardstick from which bets will be figured. It is not
the final word, merely the starting point.</TE>
<TE>   As the week progresses, the line may vary based on a multitude of
factors, from the amount of money wagered on both teams to any
injuries that might occur in practice to the whispered rumors: This
team appears distracted, that team has been spending too many late
nights on Bourbon Street.</TE>
<TE>   But bettors know the difference between the Rams and Patriots, as
decided by the gurus of oddsmaking, is now 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Monday</TE>
<TE>   Betting lines have been around for more than half a century. It
was, in the words of one long-since-forgotten gambler, "the greatest
invention since the zipper."</TE>
<TE>   Without the line, why would anyone but the most die-hard Patriot
fans bet on a team that, certainly on paper, looks inferior to the
high-flying Rams? With the betting line, the great equalizer,
everybody can back up their rooting interests with hard cash.</TE>
<TE>   Over at the MGM Grand, the line is received from Sports
Consultants on Sunday afternoon at 16. Robert Walker, director of the
race and sports book at MGM, immediately moves it to 141/2.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday morning, it settles in at 14.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a couple of small bets [at 141/2] just to see what was
out there," says Walker, "and then we quickly went to 14. As far as
I'm concerned, 15, 151/2 and 16 are dead numbers."</TE>
<TE>   The army of bettors who will flood into Las Vegas this week are
divided into three categories by Walker and his counterparts, who
take their money and hope they get to keep it.</TE>
<TE>   * There are the squares--essentially the tourists and the casual
bettors, those who come to town for the weekend and cautiously put
down $20, or, if they feel really lucky, $50.</TE>
<TE>   * There are the high rollers, the biggest casino customers. They
arrive earlier in the week and engage in everything from sports
betting to blackjack to high-stakes poker.</TE>
<TE>   * And then there are the "wise guys," but they have nothing to do
with organized crime. Rather, they are the professional sports
gamblers who come and go on the Strip just long enough to win or lose
big.</TE>
<TE>   Of these three groups, it is the wise guys who are most respected
by the bookmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "They are professionals who make their living doing this," Walker
says. "They will tell us if we have the right number."</TE>
<TE>   How do they know who is who?</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell by the amount they bet and their betting pattern,"
says Nick Bogdanovich, who runs the race and sports book at Mandalay
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the amount of money wagered, it might take 1,000
squares betting the same way to move a line half a point. It might
take only one wise guy.</TE>
<TE>   Many sports books limit the amount of money a wise guy can wager.
At MGM Grand, the wise guy can't go over $50,000 for the Super Bowl,
while high rollers are allowed up to $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Why the difference?</TE>
<TE>   "If the casino player beats us," Walker says, "he goes out and
plays with the money on the premises. The wise guy takes our money
out the door. He is of absolutely no value to us except to help us
get the right number."</TE>
<TE>   So the primary job is to get the high rollers in the hotel. Super
Bowl week, that is no problem.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday</TE>
<TE>   The propositions have come out.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as some people like to refer to them, the sucker bets.</TE>
<TE>   During Super Bowl week, the betting action is about three times
that of an average weekend during the NFL regular season, according
to Ken Epstein, executive with the Coast and Plaza hotels.</TE>
<TE>   And that increase can be traced to the general public, many of
whom are not well-versed in the intricacies of the point spread.</TE>
<TE>   Often, they flock to a series of unusual bets, which seem to grow
in number and quirkiness every year.</TE>
<TE>   The most unusual this year is a proposition by which bettors can
wager which will be higher, Laker center Shaquille O'Neal's
free-throw percentage against the Dallas Mavericks today or the total
points scored in the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry Shaq, but the Super Bowl total is favored.</TE>
<TE>   Bettors also can take either side of such wagers as:</TE>
<TE>   Which will be greater, Michael Jordan's points and rebounds for
the Washington Wizards today against the Indiana Pacers or St. Louis
quarterback Kurt Warner's pass attempts?</TE>
<TE>   Who will score more points, Jordan or the Rams? Jordan or the
Patriots? The same bet goes for O'Neal and for Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Yes or no, will any points be scored in the first 5 minutes 30
seconds of the game?</TE>
<TE>   How will the last points of the Super Bowl be scored? A St. Louis
field goal is the favorite at 7-2, a New England safety the longest
shot at 40-1.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time, these wacky bets make money for the bookmaker.
But, as any bookmaker will tell you, there are no sure things.</TE>
<TE>   Art Manteris, now at Station Casinos, was at Caesars in 1986 when
Super Bowl XX matched New England against the Chicago Bears. Manteris
propositioned whether rotund Chicago lineman William "Refrigerator"
Perry, who had occasionally gotten a goal-line appearance at
fullback, would score a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   It certainly seemed like a safe bet. Perry hadn't carried the ball
in seven weeks and his coach, Mike Ditka, insisted Perry would never
carry it again.</TE>
<TE>   Manteris set the odds at 20-1. A huge volume of Perry money bet it
down to 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   And sure enough, Perry got the ball on Super Sunday and got across
the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   "Caesars exploded when he scored," Manteris says. "We got killed
on the bet. I was ready to kill myself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday</TE>
<TE>   The line doesn't budge.</TE>
<TE>   All day long, bookmakers walk about, cell phones pressed to their
ears, or sit in front of a computer, scanning the activity of other
sports books around town, and reviewing updated team reports.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone is awaiting a decision from Patriot Coach Bill Belichick,
who finally announces late Wednesday that Brady will be today's
starting quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   In a year where the differences are so pronounced between the two
teams, the edge is so clear and the uncertainties so minuscule, the
choice between Brady, a largely unknown, 24-year-old, second-year
reserve when the season began, and Bledsoe, the proven veteran,
provides the only momentary drama of an otherwise mundane Super Bowl
week.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, though, "it really didn't matter," said
Mandalay Bay's Bogdanovich. "Everyone anticipated this would happen."</TE>
<TE>   But if the lineup question had centered on Warner, the league's
most valuable player, that would have been different. Very different.</TE>
<TE>   "If for some reason Warner couldn't play," Bogdanovich says, "I
would move the line seven points. The Rams would only be favored by
seven, or maybe less."</TE>
<TE>   And if an injury suddenly sidelined last season's league MVP, St.
Louis running back Marshall Faulk?</TE>
<TE>   "I would move the line a point," Bogdanovich says.</TE>
<TE>   Bookmakers do not move the line haphazardly.</TE>
<TE>   Let's say a sports book, in an attempt to lure additional bettors,
drops the line from 14 to 131/2. Those who are confident the Rams
will win by at least 14 may rush to the counter. To compensate, the
bookmaker may move the line to 141/2. Now, those who figure it's too
high would line up to bet on New England. If the line settles at 14
and the Rams win, 24-10, the bookmaker has to pay those who took the
Rams at 131/2 and those who took the Patriots at 141/2, while also
giving those who bet at 14 their money back.</TE>
<TE>   "That," says Korner of Sports Consultants, "is the nightmare
scenario."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thursday</TE>
<TE>   Billy Baxter is a wise guy.</TE>
<TE>   Starting as a pool hustler at age 14 in his native Georgia, Baxter
has been a professional gambler ever since.</TE>
<TE>   He does not fit the stereotype of a gambler sporting a garish
pinkie ring and a cigar. Instead, Baxter looks so mild-mannered he
could easily pass for an accountant or banker.</TE>
<TE>   A three-time winner of the World Series of Poker, Baxter wagers
about half a million dollars every Saturday on college football and
another half a million on Sunday on pro football.</TE>
<TE>   He won't reveal how much he has won, but says he's "having a good
year."</TE>
<TE>   Having a good life as well, apparently. Baxter's stately home is
richly appointed with a spiral staircase, antiques and artwork. It is
located in an exclusive area of the city, just down the street from
houses owned by Mike Tyson and Wayne Newton.</TE>
<TE>   His office, however, looks just like the offices of bookmakers and
oddsmakers all over the city, crowded with sports books and stacks of
material analyzing various sports.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter's Super Bowl wagering is long since over by this point in
the week. When the spread opened at 15 at one sports book Sunday
evening, Baxter grabbed it, taking the points and the Patriots for
$80,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that line was a little high," he says, "but come
Sunday's game, I'll sure be holding my breath."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't hold his breath before making the bet. Or look for
advice.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care what anybody else thinks about pro football," he
says. "I do my own line with pen and paper. It's not that hard to
figure."</TE>
<TE>   Even when it is hard to figure, Baxter doesn't hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   When his wife, Julie, was in the early weeks of pregnancy with the
couple's second child, he bet legendary Las Vegas bookmaker Bob
Martin $20,000 that the baby would be a girl.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter got his girl, and his $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, Baxter won $2,000 in man-to-man betting by
wagering that the Nevada State Athletic Commission would deny Mike
Tyson a boxing license.</TE>
<TE>   Used to betting at the drop of a proposition, Baxter doesn't think
much of the limits put on wise guys.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll give you a $10,000 limit," Baxter said, "but if people
then bet $50,000 the other way, they'll let you bet $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's afraid of losing their jobs these days at the sports
books. These corporations that run them don't want to hear bad news."</TE>
<TE>   How has Baxter, 61, lasted so long in such a risky business?</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason I'm still here is that I don't go on long losing
streaks," he said. "My best attribute is money management. When times
do get bad, I cut back, rein it in and ask myself, 'What am I doing
wrong?' So few survive the down times. I've had to ride out many a
storm."</TE>
<TE>   And if he loses his $80,000 today?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll figure I put in a hard day's work," he says, "and let the
chips fall where they may."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friday</TE>
<TE>   The rays of the setting sun add a natural sparkle to Glitter
Gulch, the old, original section of Las Vegas. Here stand the Golden
Nugget, the Plaza and the Horseshoe, among the earliest buildings
that transformed this area from a desert into a gambler's oasis.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel and casino owner Jackie Gaughan remembers when it was still
largely desert. Now 81 and an owner of several downtown properties,
he surveys his kingdom from a glass window as he eats dinner at his
Plaza Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   In his mind's eye, Gaughan can recall a Las Vegas where the
Flamingo Hotel, now in the heart of the Strip, "was like going out of
town to play."</TE>
<TE>   Gaughan, who began as a bookmaker in Omaha, came to Las Vegas for
military training at the start of World War II and never left. He
knew Bugsy Siegel and other pioneers who built Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Gaughan smiles at talk of an $80-million handle for Super Bowl
week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all bookmaking," he says. "Nothing has changed except the
amounts and the computers. We used to do it on a pad of paper."</TE>
<TE>   As the game draws nearer, there is a bit of nostalgia in the air
as natives prepare for the last big push of Super Bowl weekend by
swapping their favorite betting stories from a more colorful past.</TE>
<TE>   Such as the one about Bob Stupak, a local hotel and casino
personality who walked into Little Caesars and bet on the Cincinnati
Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   They were 11-point underdogs to the San Francisco 49ers in Super
Bowl XVI, but the Bengals beat the spread in that 1982 game, losing,
26-21.</TE>
<TE>   Stupak walked out of the casino carrying his winnings--$1 million
in cash--in a box.</TE>
<TE>   As dusk falls on this Friday evening, Interstate 15, the long,
asphalt trail linking Las Vegas with California, is filled with
incoming traffic, the seemingly endless line of headlights providing
a glare to rival that of the Las Vegas Strip itself.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety percent of all Super Bowl bets will be made from here on.</TE>
<TE>   "And those," Bogdanovich predicts, "will be made by the squares."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saturday</TE>
<TE>   The squares are out in force at Mandalay Bay, bringing with them
their charts, their calculations, their intuitions and their beers.</TE>
<TE>   There are well-dressed couples coming out of a show, stopping by
to check out the odds. There are the serious bettors, who scan the
floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall wagering board, carefully checking
every sport, every game, every Super Bowl proposition, before
targeting their money. There are the casual young bettors, who come
in groups, drinks in their hands, baseball caps on backward. They
reach in their pockets for leftover chips from the blackjack table or
petty cash. They'd like to win, but even if they lose, they will have
fun doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Rothstein lives in Atlantic City, N.J., but he comes across
the country for Super Bowl weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Atlantic City can't hold a candle to Las Vegas," he says. "We
don't even have sports books there."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Hoenle, a retired Las Vegas schoolteacher, is putting his
money on the Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe $150," he says. "Maybe an additional hundred. I remember
back in 1969, everybody said the [New York] Jets couldn't win [Super
Bowl III]. I think these odds are ridiculous. Of course, I'm an old
AFL guy. I still bleed for the AFL."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest misconception in oddsmaking is that the line is the
bookmaker's prediction of the final outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a myth," Walker says. "When we say the Rams will win by 14,
what we are trying to do is to come up with a number that will get
the most people to bet. Ideally, it would be an equal amount on
either side."</TE>
<TE>   The 14-point line is pulling a lot of the squares' money over to
New England today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an excessive line. It's psychological, not factual," Jack
Holland of San Francisco says before placing his wager at Mandalay
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Clay Bullock from Orange County also plans to bet. How much?
"Depends how I do at blackjack," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Woody Rill from Chicago is ready to put down his money.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a system," he says. "I pray and then bet it all, baby."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday</TE>
<TE>   It will be over today. Sometime before 8 p.m., the sports book
counters will be crowded with joyous winners showing off their
tickets, while the floors will be littered with the torn and crumpled
tickets of the losers.</TE>
<TE>   The wise guys will cash in, but not all of them.</TE>
<TE>   "How many professional gamblers have chauffeurs?" Epstein asks.
"Not too many. Playing this is like playing the stock market."</TE>
<TE>   Over at Las Vegas Sports Consultants, the page has already turned.
Anybody have an idea who the favorite should be in next week's Pro
Bowl? How is that Final Four shaping up? Who looks like a sure
pennant winner?</TE>
<TE>   The lights never go out in Sin City. Not as long as the wise guys,
and the not so wise, have money in their pockets and a sure winner in
mind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BDEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Week in Las VegasTR</TE>
<TE>   SUNDAY</TE>
<TE>   * As the final seconds tick away on the Rams' NFC championship
victory, four oddsmakers are at work to set the opening line for
Super Bowl XXXVI. They make the Rams 16-point favorites, but in hours
the line at many major books is down to 141/2.</TE>
<TE>   MONDAY</TE>
<TE>   * The books wait for the so-called "wise guys" to make their bets,
which will give them an indication as to whether the line needs to be
adjusted. It does, and the spread is lowered to 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   TUESDAY</TE>
<TE>   * The proposition bets--geared more for the general public
unfamiliar with the intricacies of point spreads--come out. So, who
will score more points, Jordan or the Rams?</TE>
<TE>   WEDNESDAY</TE>
<TE>   * The line holds firm at 14 even after New England Coach Bill
Belichick names Tom Brady--injured ankle and all--as his starting
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   THURSDAY</TE>
<TE>   * The wagering is long since over for professional gambler Billy
Baxter, who bet $80,000 on the Patriots--with a 15-point spread--on
Sunday. Baxter bets as much as $1 million a week on football.</TE>
<TE>   FRIDAY</TE>
<TE>   * The roads are clogged with incoming traffic as Las Vegas gears
up for the weekend. Ninety percent of all Super Bowl bets will be
made from here on.</TE>
<TE>   SATURDAY</TE>
<TE>   * There is plenty of day-before betting, most of it done by the
"squares," whose wagering amount is often determined by how well they
do at the blackjack table.</TE>

<HD>Allen Finally Joins Into-the-Hall Gang</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Exuberant coach turned around teams in L.A.
and Washington. Kelly, Casper, Hampton and Stallworth also honored.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB OATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Former Los Angeles Ram Coach George Allen and four former NFL
players, Jim Kelly among them, were elected to the Pro Football Hall
of Fame here Saturday when former Coach Bill Parcells was dinged on
the final round of voting.</LD>
<LD>   At least 80% of the 35 members of the selection committee in
attendance, the required plurality, agreed that Allen, who died in
1990, and former Buffalo quarterback Kelly belonged but that Parcells
and former Miami Dolphin lineman Bob Kuechenberg didn't.</LD>
<LD>   Making the grade with Allen and Kelly were the best of the old
tight ends, Dave Casper of the Raiders, along with two other former
All-Pros, defensive lineman Dan Hampton of the Chicago Bears and wide
receiver John Stallworth of the Pittsburgh Steelers. And so of the
7,000 who have played NFL football since the 1920s, 216 are now in
the Hall of Fame.</LD>
<TE>   Each year, on the day before the Super Bowl, committee members,
most of them veteran newspaper football writers from the larger U.S.
cities, vote to see who will be enshrined at Canton, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   In other years, Allen, who coached the Rams from 1966-70 and also
the Washington Redskins, has reached the round of six but advanced no
further.</TE>
<TE>   "He would have been very proud of this," his son Bruce, a Raider
executive, said afterward, recalling that one of Allen's favorite
motivational tools was to call for, when earned, three cheers.</TE>
<TE>   "His first reaction here would have been to ask for three cheers,"
his son said, "But in this case, that would have been hard for him to
do. So his family will do it for him."</TE>
<TE>   Among Allen's Hall of Fame achievements, he turned around two
steady losers, the 1960s Rams and the '70s Redskins, "The
Over-the-Hill Gang," and kept them winning as long as he was in
charge--five years in Los Angeles and seven in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Among those with 10 or more years in the league, he is the only
coach who never had a losing season.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, the 1986-96 Buffalo quarterback who was chosen in his first
year of Hall of Fame eligibility, said of his election: "Wow! They
paid me to have fun, and I always did. No one ever enjoyed it more."</TE>
<TE>   As one of the few to play in four consecutive Super Bowls, Kelly
was on the losing side in every game, from 1991-94.</TE>
<TE>   But he was the leader of that team, and some NFL critics have
suggested that it's harder to get to the Super Bowl four times in a
row than to win it once. The Hall of Fame selectors agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Some voters noted that in the Bills' Super Bowl era, Kelly took
over the team and called all the plays, making it possible for him to
beat better teams with better quarterbacks--among them Denver with
John Elway and Miami with Dan Marino.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's play-calling and field leadership, they said, were
decisive in those years when he was the last player to match wits
with coaches on NFL fields.</TE>
<TE>   Although Raider quarterback Jim Plunkett was the last player
empowered by his team to call the plays, in 1984, Kelly sought that
distinction for some time before his coaches agreed to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's effective play-calling defeated some of the era's most
famous coaches, among them Don Shula of Miami and Dan Reeves of
Denver, now of Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   When Kelly was questioned on this point Saturday, he gave the
credit to his coach, Hall of Famer Marv Levy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm grateful that Marv Levy and [offensive coordinator] Ted
Marchibroda had enough confidence in me to give me total control of
the offense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A former run-and-shoot quarterback in the U.S. Football League,
Kelly is the first USFL player to make the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "But there will soon be two more, Reggie White and Steve Young,"
he said, adding: "I learned the passing game in the USFL--from Mouse
Davis and Jack Pardee."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly is also the first member of the legendary quarterback class
of 1983 to gain the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan Marino was the first to get to the Super Bowl, and John Elway
was the first to win a Super Bowl," Kelly said. "But, yes, I got here
first."</TE>
<TE>   Of the others elected to the Hall of Fame Class of 2002:</TE>
<TE>   * Casper, the 1974-80 Raider tight end who played for the team in
both Oakland and Los Angeles, said: "This happened on a great day--my
50th birthday."</TE>
<TE>   * Hampton, who played defensive end and defensive tackle for the
1980s Bears, said: "I'm honored, humbled and grateful."</TE>
<TE>   * Stallworth, the 1974-87 wide receiver who played opposite Lynn
Swann at Pittsburgh on the Steelers' finest teams, said: "My wife
just ran through the house screaming."</TE>
<TE>   With Stallworth's selection, Pittsburgh's 1-2-3 draft choices of
1974 are now in the Hall of Fame. In order, the Steeler draft that
year, often called the greatest draft in history, started with Swann
on the first round and continued with linebacker Jack Lambert and
Stallworth on the second and third rounds.</TE>
<TE>   The election process that climaxed with choice of Stallworth and
four others is the only one of its kind in sports.</TE>
<TE>   It began when, by mail, the selectors cut the nominees to a
comfortably sized group of 25. Of these, 14 were voted finalists,
also by mail.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on the first round of voting Saturday, the 14 were reduced
to 11. The three receiving the fewest votes on that round were
Baltimore owner Art Modell, Raider punter Ray Guy and Pittsburgh
safety Donnie Shell.</TE>
<TE>   When the round of 11 was reduced to six nominees, the five players
eliminated were New York Giant linebacker Harry Carson, Pittsburgh
defensive end L.C. Greenwood, Raider cornerback Lester Hayes, wide
receiver Art Monk and wide receiver James Lofton.</TE>
<TE>   Those elected will be enshrined in July at Canton.</TE>

<PH>SUPER BOWL XXXVI / NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS VS. ST. LOUIS RAMS</PH>
<KH>Bill Plaschke</KH>
<HD>Beat Goes On: Once More, With Healing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The game is a mismatch, the town is a rascal, and the cops are
everywhere.</LD>
<LD>Everyone's talking about patriotism, but the team wearing red,
white and blue will probably have the dawn's early light beaten out
of it.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone's talking about security, but the probable winners were
stolen from another city.</LD>
<TE>   Thus, the Super Bowl will stagger into our homes this afternoon,
as it has done for 35 years, wearing a gaudy tie of excess knotted
above a wrinkled shirt of expectation.</TE>
<TE>   But also with a pulse.</TE>
<TE>   A wonderful, familiar pulse.</TE>
<TE>   We will recognize it not because it belongs to a player or a team,
but because it is ours, the pulse of a nation that has been checking
such things often since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to the quickened beat. Hoping for the slowing thump.
Waiting for normal.</TE>
<TE>   With the start of today's Super Bowl XXXVI at the Superdome, that
wait could be over.</TE>
<TE>   For the four hours it takes for the St. Louis Rams to play the New
England Patriots, something will occur that was unthinkable for most
of the last five months.</TE>
<TE>   The nation will halt for a football game.</TE>
<TE>   Not for a speech. Not for a news flash. For a football game.</TE>
<TE>   It will be sweaty, bruising, even bloody, and that's just in your
family room.</TE>
<TE>   But it will be normal. We will be normal.</TE>
<TE>   The specter of armed guards and terrorist warnings will remind us
it is a new normal, perhaps. But it is normality nonetheless, of a
kind that couldn't be discerned previously, at least not on this sort
of giant stage.</TE>
<TE>   The Super Bowl is Thanksgiving without the stress, Christmas
without the religious wars, New Year's Eve without Dick Clark. It is
the World Series doubled. It is the Final Four squared.</TE>
<TE>   It won't matter if it's a terrible game. It's almost always a
terrible game.</TE>
<TE>   It won't matter if the TV announcers are lousy. We love the
commercials.</TE>
<TE>   It won't matter that we eat too much, and spill on the carpet, and
fall asleep on the couch. We do that every year.</TE>
<TE>   The important thing about today is that, no matter what happened
nearly five months ago, we are doing it again.</TE>
<TE>   In this Super Bowl, the most important play will not be the
longest pass or most dazzling run or winning touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The most important play today will be the kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Kummerer family of Chandler, Ariz., will be sitting
in my Los Angeles house with members of my family to watch that
kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   Circumstances have made it a pain--they will fly in on the morning
of the game, they will fly home early the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   But they will be there because, for the last 22 Super Bowls, that
is what our families have done. We watch the game together.</TE>
<TE>   No matter where we live, no matter how busy we may be, no matter
that we rarely talk the rest of the year.</TE>
<TE>   On Super Bowl Sunday, minus a certain sportswriter, we are
together.</TE>
<TE>   For us, it is more than a game, it is a connection.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 have altered all of our lives in many ways.
But it wasn't going to change my family's Super Bowl tradition. Not a
chance.</TE>
<TE>   For many of the 130 million viewers in the United States, today
will undoubtedly be an affirmation of that same conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Remember one of the first sports questions anybody dared ask after
the terrorist attacks?</TE>
<TE>   What about the Super Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   We asked it not because we cared about our football, but because
we cared about our culture.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there are many values in our game that are important to
society at large today," NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Friday.</TE>
<TE>Corny, maybe. But this is what we've come to expect not just from our
biggest game, but from ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   What about the Super Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   Well, what about it? It's here, and who do you like?</TE>
<TE>   Do you like Goliaths? If you do, you will cheer for the Rams, who,
with a high-scoring blowout, can proclaim their offense the best in
NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to enjoy Kurt Warner, the pleasant former supermarket
worker who is becoming one of the greatest quarterbacks in history.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to admire Marshall Faulk, the running back who has raced
out of the New Orleans housing projects and into fame.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, the Rams were virtually stolen from Los Angeles seven years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   But this is an entirely different team, and if they win, you can
always mute Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, though, you like Davids? If so, then you should know that
the Patriots are full of them.</TE>
<TE>   Their quarterback, Tom Brady, was the 199th player taken in the
draft, threw all of three passes in his rookie season in 2000, and is
playing now only because starter Drew Bledsoe suffered an injury that
nearly killed him.</TE>
<TE>   Blocking for Brady will be Joe Andruzzi, a guard whose brother is
a New York firefighter who barely escaped the collapsing World Trade
Center towers on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching Brady should have been the beloved Dick Rehbein, a
quarterback coach who died suddenly before this year's training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Inspiration everywhere, and maybe it will help one team win, not
that it matters.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely, in fact, has a Super Bowl's outcome mattered so little.</TE>
<TE>   Today's game is about the national anthem, the national audience,
the national psyche. It's about four safe quarters of football, a
safe afternoon of hot dogs and nachos, then a giant sigh as we leave
our parties and step outside into the doubts of the still new year.</TE>
<TE>   If the Super Bowl has survived, then so have we.</TE>

<LD>My Super Bowl Diary: Days 5 and 6</LD>
<LD>   NEW ORLEANS--When I heard the mayor of Los Angeles was going to
make the selfless sacrifice to fly here for Super Bowl 36 to meet
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and make a pitch for the return of
football, I wanted to help.</LD>
<LD>   I called the mayor's office, the lady on the phone wanted to know
who was calling, and when I told her, she immediately put me
through--to Hilda Delgado.</LD>
<TE>   I made a promise to myself to start reading the front page of The
Times instead of only the Sports section because I was embarrassed to
say I had no idea Hilda had already replaced Jim Hahn as mayor of
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Hilda explained to me she worked in the press office, she doesn't
read the Sports section unless it's baseball season and she's an
Oakland A's fan. I'm not surprised City Hall ran out of Dodger fans
to hire.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later I received a telephone call in my hotel room and
this friendly voice saying, "Hi, this is Mike Garrett.''</TE>
<TE>   The friendly voice, of course, was a dead giveaway, but it was a
nice try by Mayor Hahn. Had he identified himself as Steven Sample, I
might have bought it, because I've never heard his voice.</TE>
<TE>   As a rule I like to see what people are made of, so right away I
chastised the mayor for going on the radio recently and making the
mistake of saying there are 31 teams in the NFL and L.A. has a good
shot now of becoming No. 32.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor blamed the faux pas on his staff, and for a moment there
I thought I was talking to Sports Editor Bill Dwyre, but then the
mayor laughed to let me know it was his fault, and I knew it wasn't
Dwyre.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm coming to meet Mr. Tagliabue," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Be prepared to fall asleep," I said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW WHAT happened next might be the most impressive thing I've
heard since covering this NFL-L.A. saga after the departure of the
Rams and Raiders in 1995: "This is something I have to do," the mayor
said, "I've got to be the point person in this thing if L.A. is going
to have a football team."</TE>
<TE>   Nashville, Cleveland, Baltimore, St. Louis and Houston were each
successful in securing a team because each city had a strong
identifiable leader--something L.A. lacked when the opportunity was
there to get an expansion team.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time everyone fought too much among themselves and the
mayor didn't take an active role," Hahn said. "The people of this
city are not going to provide a lavish public expenditure for a new
stadium--that's real clear, but there is still a lot local government
can do to make this happen."</TE>
<TE>   I WAS expecting the mayor to fly here on a corporate jet, or at
the very least first class the way Dwyre does, but the mayor insisted
on going coach. He also told me he insisted on an aisle seat, so
there's a limit to his common-man routine.</TE>
<TE>   But I was impressed at the incredible sacrifice he was
making--leaving the city of Los Angeles for the Super Bowl and
missing the NHL All-Star game Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   That's why I was unable to provide Day 5 of "My Super Bowl Diary,"
in Saturday's newspaper, because as soon as I heard what the mayor
was doing, I spent morning, noon and Friday night walking up and down
Bourbon Street.</TE>
<TE>   When I tell you the mayor left his wife behind in L.A. and here I
am walking up and down Bourbon Street on his behalf--before you get
any wrong ideas, do you know how difficult it is to find a TV around
here that will show the NHL All-Star game?</TE>
<TE>   But right across the street from the Ragin' Rooster, next to the
Boogie Woogie, I found Utopia, and don't let the jiggling girl waving
the "Live Dancing" sign fool you--inside they had the NHL Celebrity
Game on two TVs, and although the place was packed, it still felt as
if I was the only one watching the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TWO WEEKS ago former Dodger owner Peter O'Malley and Casey
Wasserman, L.A.'s favorite grandson, went to New York for a sit-down
session with Tagliabue. It was the first indication--since O'Malley
abandoned plans to build a football stadium at Dodger Stadium after
losing Mayor Richard Riordan's support--he is interested in football
again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm helping as a friend--I'm energized by it because I think it
has to happen soon for L.A.," O'Malley said. "I'm thrilled to hear
the mayor wants to be point man."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, O'Malley and Wasserman all say the same thing: The benefit
to L.A. is Super Bowls, and to get Super Bowls L.A. must get a team.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe having the Super Bowl in L.A. justifies whatever
taxpayer dollars are spent--and they may be very minimal--in getting
L.A. the finest football stadium," O'Malley said. "The project can be
an absolute success for taxpayers, and when elected officials see
that, I believe they will stand up and proudly speak on behalf of
such a project wherever the stadium may be located."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   RIGHT NOW, of course, I'm just thrilled the mayor of L.A. knows
there are 32 teams in the NFL. That's progress.</TE>
<TE>   "Who do you think is going to win the Super Bowl?" Hahn asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to let you off that hook that easy," I told the
mayor. "Tell me who is playing in the game."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor didn't hesitate: "Notre Dame against ..."</TE>
<TE>   I'm telling you, a mayor with a sense of humor is the best thing
we have going for us when it comes to dealing with the jokers who run
NFL.</TE>

<DH>Summerall's Partnership With Madden Ends Today; He Didn't
Want It to, but He Didn't Have a Choice</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>When a 71-year-old man wants to keep working at his job, working the
way he always has, working because his passion for the work is
strong, his desire for the work still immense and his confidence in
himself still high, there is not a graceful way for the boss to tell
the 71-year-old that a change is going to happen.</LD>
<LD>   So here sits Pat Summerall, wearing a blue track suit and very sad
eyes, using an economy of words that are hiding overflowing emotion.
"The game," Summerall says, "is the thing."</LD>
<LD>   Close your eyes. If you are an NFL fan, if you have watched NFL
games on Sundays for the last 21 years, you can certainly make
yourself hear Summerall say those words. "The game is the thing." The
voice is deep but not in a fake, "I'm a TV announcer" way. The voice
is so smooth. Each word flows into the next.</LD>
<TE>   It sounds simple and easy. It is safe and familiar, a voice that
makes the world sound OK, the game sound homey.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting next to Summerall is John Madden, 65. Madden has been
Summerall's TV broadcast partner for 21 years. The game Summerall
speaks of as being "the thing" is Super Bowl XXXVI, between the St.
Louis Rams and the New England Patriots. It will be the last game
Summerall and Madden broadcast together.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall made the announcement two weeks ago that today's Super
Bowl broadcast would be his last on Fox with Madden.</TE>
<TE>   It was not his choice, Summerall said then and says now. When
someone asked Summerall this week if making the announcement, a badly
kept secret for almost a year, was a relief, Summerall looked up and
his voice changed tone. It was not a smooth and comforting voice. It
was a louder voice, an angry voice.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not necessarily a relief," Summerall said, "not to have a
job."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles we aren't used to our announcers being put out to
pasture. Chick Hearn, estimated age 85, will be welcomed back to the
Laker broadcast booth as soon as he has recovered from heart surgery.
Keith Jackson is still the TV voice of Pacific 10 football. Vin
Scully wouldn't dare leave the Dodgers. The Dodgers wouldn't dare
suggest he should. Both Jackson and Scully are in their 70s.</TE>
<TE>   In his interviews lately, Summerall has affirmed that he is
healthy, that he still is madly in love with the game, with the
grinding preparations and the weekly travel involved in doing
television.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to work somewhere," Summerall says. "I plan to find other
employment."</TE>
<TE>   Summerall has indicated he'd enjoy a return to tennis
broadcasting. When he worked for CBS, Summerall had been the voice of
the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Morning News reported this week that Summerall might
become the TV voice of the Dallas Cowboys for Fox, doing only his
hometown Cowboy broadcasts every week. Summerall told the newspaper
he would be very happy in that role.</TE>
<TE>   Today will be the last time Madden starts from way over here to
make a point and finally gets to the point way over there, and gets
to the point only because Summerall, with that voice acting as a
calming, steadying hand, leads Madden to it.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I take a while to get where I'm going," Madden says.
"Sometimes I don't even know where I'm going. I'm talking and talking
and time is running out and Pat breaks in and he gets me to the
point. Just in time."</TE>
<TE>   Madden looks at Summerall. Summerall turns his head sideways.</TE>
<TE>   This is an uncomfortable time for these two big men.</TE>
<TE>   Madden doesn't want to say goodbye either. Madden doesn't want to
break in a new partner. Madden is not going to change his way. He is
not suddenly going to speak in simple sentences and express simple
thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Whomever Fox gives to Madden as his partner next year--Joe Buck, a
talented 32-year-old, the son of broadcasting legend Jack Buck, a
vibrant, verbal, on-the-fast-track go-getter who will be able to
promote the Barenaked Ladies or "Ally McBeal" and not sound 71 and
uptight about it, is the reported Summerall replacement--Madden
doesn't care.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to work and I am what I am," Madden says. And he makes it
clear he is not enthusiastic about Summerall's forced departure.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope," Madden says, "that Pat is happy whatever he does. I am a
passionate traditionalist. You run into some people in life who are
national treasures and Pat Summerall is a national treasure for the
NFL. We shouldn't fight it when we have a national treasure. "I
wonder why we're fighting it."</TE>
<TE>   It was at a New York Giant-Tampa Bay Buccaneer game in 1980 that
Madden and Summerall were pushed together.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall had been partnered on CBS with Tom Brookshier. Summerall
remembers that Brookshier needed the weekend off.</TE>
<TE>   "His daughter," Summerall says, "was making her debut in
Philadelphia that weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Madden had retired from coaching the Raiders after the 1978
season. He had done six games for CBS in 1979, sort of a tryout, and
was working full-time in 1980. Madden was the rotating announcer, the
rookie moving from partner to partner.</TE>
<TE>   When he saw Madden on that hot, Florida afternoon, Summerall
remembers: "John was sweating so profusely, I thought he must have
been nervous about being on the air and that maybe he should find
another business.</TE>
<TE>   "But it turned out that the booth was up high and John was afraid
of heights. That's why he was sweating. I didn't know about his fear
of flying then either.</TE>
<TE>   "And once we started the broadcast, I saw what a great concept of
the game John had. Unlike so many analysts who only know their own
positions, John saw the offensive and defensive concepts and could
articulate them in a limited period of time."</TE>
<TE>   Since that first day in Tampa, Madden and Summerall have broadcast
an estimated 450 games together. They have gone to practices
together, gone to dinner hundreds of times, celebrated happy times,
helped each other in hard times.</TE>
<TE>   Madden says Summerall was the perfect complement.</TE>
<TE>   "Pat made it easy for me," Madden says. "He was very smooth and
knowledgeable. Pat was a lot of things I was not and that made us
pretty good. I could go on and on. I could use 300 words and Pat
could make sense of my 300 words in one word."</TE>
<TE>   Madden struggles to find 300 words, or three, to describe how he
will feel today.</TE>
<TE>   "To say there's a word or a lot of words would be an injustice. To
say I'm going to miss him sounds stupid. It sounds trite.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 21 years. At some point it hits me that this is final. It's
an emotional week. Everything will be the last."</TE>
<TE>   Summerall doesn't allow himself to think that way. If he starts
thinking about the end, then, he says, "I'm not sure how I'd get
through the week. I imagine I will have some emotion [today]. I don't
know if I will say anything. I imagine I might. But I don't know
what."</TE>
<TE>   Smoothly, then, Summerall turned the conversation away from
goodbye. He had a funny story about him and Madden and their first
Super Bowl together. It was in 1982, San Francisco against
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "I was asking John questions before kickoff," Summerall says. "The
camera moved in tight on John. That was when I would walk over and
put my headset on so I could listen to the coin toss on the field.
Except I couldn't find the headset.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an unwritten rule that if you can't find what you're
looking for, follow the cable. So I did. I kept pulling and pulling,
following the cable until it came up against John's rear end."</TE>
<TE>   Madden was sitting on the head set. When Summerall pulled the
headset out, the earpiece was on top of Summerall's head, the
microphone bent out of shape.</TE>
<TE>   That headset was all disheveled, going in every direction. Kind of
like Madden. But Summerall got things straightened out in time to get
on the air. As usual.</TE>
<TE>   As this broadcast team evolved, Madden got less frantic, less
sweaty, less prone to wandering aimlessly with his stories. Summerall
became more and more spare with his words so he could allow Madden
the space to tell his stories, to wander a little but not too much.</TE>
<TE>   When Fox took the NFL from CBS in 1994, the bosses made Madden and
Summerall their big hire even though there were rumors that Madden
and Summerall were a bad fit for the young network, which aimed for
an audience more in tune with "The Simpsons" and "The X-Files" and
less in tune with national treasures.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Buck is Fox's future. Fox hopes Buck becomes the voice of the
big event, like Dick Enberg or Bob Costas or Jim Nantz.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall will walk into the Super Bowl booth today determined to
keep his feelings out of it.</TE>
<TE>   "The game," he says, "is the story of the utmost importance.
That's what we're here to do."</TE>

<HD>Patterns of Freedom Still Sending Special Messages</HD>
<DH>History: Art show includes African American quilts
containing symbols used to warn slaves on the Underground Railroad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he put together an exhibit of ceramic sculptures, quilts and
paintings for Black History Month, art student Sean Beard of Cal
State Northridge drew on his roots.</LD>
<LD>   "Mother Weep No More" at the campus Performing Arts Center Gallery
features a dozen quilts made by members of the African American Quilt
Guild of Los Angeles, including his aunts, skilled quilters who love
the traditional and practical art form.</LD>
<LD>   Beard, 28, said he was inspired by the work of his mother, painter
Jeanette Brewer, whose scenes of African American quilting and
plantation life are on display. The show also includes a freedom
quilt made by a great-aunt, Elizabeth Ramsey, that incorporates
symbols used to send secret messages to slaves traveling the
Underground Railroad.</LD>
<TE>   Ramsey, who will be 86 on Feb. 18, said she learned to quilt as a
little girl on the farm her father sharecropped in Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   "We used quilts then to cover up and keep warm in the winter," she
recalled. "It wasn't anything fancy like they make today." Her
childhood quilts were typically made up of nine patches, "mostly
strips and blocks," she said, and they were designed using her
imagination, without benefit of pattern books or designs downloaded
from the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey quilts every day, sometimes using her treadle sewing
machine and sometimes doing handwork. "I can see to thread the
tiniest needle," she said. "I had cataract surgery last year in June,
and that helped a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Her freedom quilt is done in what she describes as African
colors--green, orange, black, yellow and red--a departure from her
usual, more subdued palette.</TE>
<TE>   The quilt incorporates motifs that are believed to have been used
to help slaves make their way to safety in Northern states and
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The quilt code, Beard said, is described in a 1999 book by
Jacqueline L. Tobin and Raymond G. Dobard titled "Hidden in Plain
View: A Secret Story of Quilts and the Underground Railroad."</TE>
<TE>   The authors write that certain symbols were incorporated into
quilts to tell escaping slaves when to get ready and what routes to
take, and to relay other information vital to evading those who would
have kept them in bondage.</TE>
<TE>   Much as Harriet Tubman sang certain spirituals in a particular way
to send messages to those she was leading to freedom, messages were
sent "by hanging a quilt on the rails of a fence," Beard said.</TE>
<TE>   Tobin and Dobard write that they learned the code from an African
American quilter in South Carolina, the late Ozella McDaniel
Williams, who said the meanings of the symbols had been handed down
in her family from one generation to the next.</TE>
<TE>   The authors acknowledge that they cannot prove Ozella Williams'
story. But they describe how a quilt with a monkey wrench motif
casually tossed over a windowsill or a fence told the enslaved to
gather up their tools and other belongings; they would soon be on
their way to freedom. A quilt that featured a motif called the
drunkard's path reminded potential escapees that a zigzag route was
safer than a straight one in eluding potential captors.</TE>
<TE>   "I get chills just talking about it," said Dottie Brown of
Bellflower, who made a black-and-white freedom quilt for the show.
Its center square provides a key to the dozen or so symbols of the
Underground Railroad code.</TE>
<TE>   Louise McGee of Inglewood made a three-dimensional quilt featuring
a figure of abolitionist and former slave Sojourner Truth.</TE>
<TE>   A quilt by Doris Parker of Los Angeles includes African symbols
that appear on traditional Adinkra cloth from Ghana. "Africans
communicated with textiles," Beard explained.</TE>
<TE>   Beard said his aunt, Sondra Brewer, is the family's premier
quilter. Several of her creations are on display.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we have a family reunion, a quilt is auctioned off,"
Beard said. "It's to benefit the kids; it's like a scholarship.
Everybody fights over hers. And she just laughs."</TE>
<TE>   Beard has created art since childhood, he said, encouraged by his
mother and inspired by Ernie Barnes, the African American artist
whose paintings were featured on the 1970s television series "Good
Times."</TE>
<TE>   Beard, who lives in Burbank, enrolled at CSUN to study business
and play football. But his NFL dreams ended with knee injuries. Now
he finds his bliss in the art studio and readying his work for
firing.</TE>
<TE>   When he looks at his sculptures of people who have known slavery,
he said, "I see pain and sadness, but I also see spirituality and
growth."</TE>
<TE>   Although the show, which continues through June 1, may be
especially appropriate for Black History Month, Beard said he hopes
it speaks to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't just look at color," he said. "I look at a group being
oppressed and coming to victory. I know about the potato famine. I
know about the Holocaust. . . . If you understand each other, it's
gonna be all right."</TE>

<LD>RAM PASS OFFENSE VS. PATRIOT PASS DEFENSE</LD>
<LD>   Leave it to Bill Belichick to devise a scheme to at least slow
down the Rams' "Greatest Show on Earth." In a 24-17 Ram victory at
New England on Nov. 18, Belichick had as many as seven players drop
into zone coverage. That format was less than successful: Kurt Warner
torched the Patriots for 401 yards and three touchdowns. Blitzing
Warner won't work either; his Arena League experience taught him to
check off multiple receivers and hit open seams with accuracy in a
matter of seconds. If the Patriots don't find a way to disguise
coverages, disrupt timing and get to Warner with their linemen, Ram
receivers Torry Holt, Isaac Bruce, Az-Zahir Hakim and Ricky Proehl
will turn this game into a track meet.</LD>

game last week, allowing only 58 yards. However, that won't be
effective against the multidimensional Rams because Marshall Faulk
isn't a hammer inside. Faulk gains most of his yards off tackle and
on play action. New England could fill gaps by using linebackers as
ends in a 5-2 alignment, but that would leave only four men in
coverage, which is asking for big trouble.</TE>

<TE>   PATRIOT PASS OFFENSE VS. RAM PASS DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Don't be surprised to see Drew Bledsoe warming up on the sideline
should starter Tom Brady falter early. If the Patriots fall behind,
only the strong-armed Bledsoe has the timing and command to sting the
Rams' soft coverage with deeper passes. Under Brady, New England's
passing game is conservative and accurate, often allowing opposing
defenses to dictate the low-risk short-to-intermediate routes to
receivers Troy Brown and David Patten. Running backs J.R. Redmond and
Kevin Faulk provide reliable short-range options.</TE>
<TE>   EDGE: Rams</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PATRIOT RUN OFFENSE VS. RAM RUN DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   If New England has one advantage over St. Louis it is in its
inside running game. Offensive linemen Joe Andruzzi and Mike Compton
are bulldozers, outweighing their Ram counterparts, defensive tackle
Jeff Zgonina and Brian Young. Antowain Smith has the ability to grind
out valuable yards and keep the Ram offense off the field as long as
the score is close. Should the Rams take a big lead, Smith will be
shelved in favor of the passing game.</TE>
<TE>   EDGE: Patriots</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SPECIAL TEAMS</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots make the most of their outstanding special teams,
which were responsible for the margin of victory in playoff wins over
the Raiders and Steelers. New England excels at keeping the game
close and then winning on a big turnover or special teams play. The
Rams have had their trouble in kickoff and punt coverage, and Brown
is tough to stop on returns.</TE>
<TE>   EDGE: Patriots</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COACHING</TE>
<TE>   Mike Martz and Belichick are two of the most creative coaches in
the game. Both are adept at exploiting weaknesses by disguising their
intentions until the very last moment. The difference here will be
the level of talent. Martz is pitting his thoroughbreds against
Belichick's gutsy quarter horses.</TE>
<TE>   EDGE: Rams</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INTANGIBLES</TE>
<TE>   Lack of speed will hurt the Patriot secondary. St. Louis will
create mismatches by flooding zones with more than one receiver.
There isn't a linebacker in the NFL who can cover Faulk one-on-one.
The Rams' familiarity with the Superdome and its artificial surface
puts the game's outcome heavily in their favor.</TE>

<PH>SUPER BOWL XXXVI / NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS VS. ST. LOUIS RAMS</PH>
<KH>NOTES</KH>
<HD>Jones Sends Message to Foster and Family</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>When the story first broke and UCLA began investigating DeShaun
Foster's use of a sport utility vehicle, the name of agent Sean
Jones, the former Raider defensive end, surfaced and was quickly
dismissed by those who checked further.</LD>
<LD>   The rumors, however, have been slow to die.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, here for the Super Bowl, is angry now, and he asked that a
message be delivered--complete with obscenities--to demonstrate just
how mad he is.</LD>
<TE>   "I met that kid twice, and his mother is telling everyone that I
turned him into the NCAA," said Jones, who has been edited for public
consumption. "How dumb is the kid anyway--walking into a Ford
dealership and thinking no one is going to notice him getting an
expensive vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "I spoke to the kid twice in my life, once to say 'good game,' and
the second time to tell him if he wanted to talk at the end of the
season--at the end of the season--we would. I swear on my kids' lives
that's all that ever happened.</TE>
<TE>   "But I've got his mother telling people I hurt her son and the kid
not speaking up and setting everything straight. If I hear that
again, I'm gonna sue them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New England quarterback Tom Brady has started only 16 NFL games,
and he's on the verge of playing in front of an estimated worldwide
viewing audience of 800 million people, but he seems cool as a Boston
breeze.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't surprise Marcellus Wiley, a Pro Bowl defensive end
for San Diego who faced him in Week Four.</TE>
<TE>   The way Wiley sees it, the real pressure begins for Brady when the
season ends.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll have the whole off-season to harden those expectations,"
Wiley said. "He'll start thinking how good he is or how bad he can
be. Not now. He's got the momentum. You can't slow this train down
right now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before he signed with St. Louis this season, defensive end Chidi
Ahanotu played for Tampa Bay. He was on the Buccaneer team last
season that beat the Rams, 38-35, in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   So, Chidi, how do you beat the Rams?</TE>
<TE>   "You don't come to play a team like the Rams hoping you can shut
them down," he said. "You just don't do that. You just hope that you
can get some turnovers. You hope you can get some big plays, and
these are things you can't design with Xs and O's.</TE>
<TE>   "You hope somebody comes and gets a big hit, knocks somebody out,
those kinds of things. The losses we had this year, you had two good
defenses that had the kind of athletes that have speed to match up
with our speed. Unfortunately, a lot of guys can't count on that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Jay Mohr doesn't give New England much of a chance today.</TE>
<TE>   "If, during the national anthem when they release the bald eagle,
the eagle loops back around and pecks out one of Kurt Warner's eyes,
then I think the Patriots have a chance," he said Friday in his
stand-up act at New Orleans' historic Sanger theater.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knows that the NFL is a game of specialists, but ...</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Martz, Ram coach and offensive guru, startled even veteran
observers this week when answering questions about his defense and
special teams.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if they were preparing differently for Patriot
quarterbacks Brady or Drew Bledsoe, he said, "I don't know. You'll
have to ask Lovie [Smith, defensive coordinator] about that one.''</TE>
<TE>   Then, when asked whether he was concerned that the Patriots use
their starters on special teams, he said he had no idea who plays
special teams for the Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NFL owners unanimously approved the sale of the Atlanta Falcons to
Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank, who said Dan Reeves would remain
as coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers T.J. Simers, Sam Farmer, Bill Plaschke and the
Associated Press contributed to this report.</TE>

<PH>SUPER BOWL XXXVI / NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS VS. ST. LOUIS RAMS</PH>
<KH>COMMENTARY</KH>
<HD>With Warner, Rams Will Roll</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Barring an injury to their quarterback, it will be the upset of the
century if anybody but the Rams wins this game.</LD>
<LD>   It's true, sure, that the quarterback is the big man on any NFL
team, but the Rams are more than normally dependent on theirs.</LD>
<LD>   On their way to a 14-2 mark this season, it was Kurt Warner who
got them going each week as the field leader of Coach Mike Martz's
unique offense and as the magic-armed passer who made possible their
503-point roll, becoming the only football team that ever scored 500
three years in a row.</LD>
<TE>   They'll need him in Super Bowl XXXVI even if they decide to run
the ball with their other superstar, the inimitable Marshall Faulk,
and even if they run it well.</TE>
<TE>   For the underlying explanation is always the same when Faulk
gains, say, 159 yards, as he did last week to eliminate the
Philadelphia Eagles: No defensive team can ever focus fully on Faulk,
on any down, when it's always likely that play-caller Martz, who
loves pass offense more than he loves the Rams, will call on Warner
to throw it.</TE>
<TE>   "The three things a quarterback has got to have are intelligence,
toughness, and passing accuracy," Martz said the other day. "And
that's Warner."</TE>
<TE>   Fluke Team</TE>
<TE>   Here's another way to look at XXXVI: It's a fluke that the
Patriots are even here. They're a nice little team, but they don't
belong in this game.</TE>
<TE>   For wildly different reasons, the AFC's four best teams,
Pittsburgh, Oakland, Denver and Indianapolis, imploded--most recently
the Steelers, who gave the game to New England last week on a blocked
field-goal attempt.</TE>
<TE>   The thing to keep in mind about blocking field-goal attempts is
that it is extremely difficult. The timing is such that it's
impossible for a sprinter to get through an NFL line fast
enough--provided the kicking team is properly coached--unless the
snap is fumbled, which this one wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots not only blocked the kick, they ran it all the way
back. The swing was 10 points in a game that Pittsburgh lost by 7.</TE>
<TE>   A week earlier, the Patriots not only got the ball back from a
courageous referee--who had first seen an interception incorrectly as
a fumble--they also lucked into a passing team from Oakland that
unaccountably quit passing, fearing the snowstorm. Talk about flukes.
The New England passer, Tom Brady, greeted the driving snow as if it
were so many sunbeams.</TE>
<TE>   As the snow piled up, Brady, throwing on virtually every down,
completed 18 of his last 19 passes on the three scoring drives that
took the Patriots to Pittsburgh, where Steeler Coach Bill Cowher was
waiting to give them that blocked field-goal attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Brady is the Patriots' best quarterback. He's as bright as Warner
and as unflappable, but he's hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The other quarterback, Drew Bledsoe, is immobile. The fluke run is
over.</TE>
<TE>   Making Mischief</TE>
<TE>   Football's best teams this season are in the NFC--San Francisco,
Green Bay, Philadelphia and Chicago--and the Rams beat all but the
Bears, whom they didn't play.</TE>
<TE>   They have, in fact, overrun so many opponents in Martz's three
years as the Ram offense designer and play-caller that they are now a
viable candidate for the dominating team that football fans have
pined for since the days when the Green Bay Packers won five NFL
titles in 10 years and the Pittsburgh Steelers won four in six.</TE>
<TE>   Like Martz's Rams, those teams weren't successful every Sunday, or
every season, either.</TE>
<TE>   But they did succeed over a long period of years, which is one
definition of dominance. For the Rams, this is only Year 3. Even so,
Martz has already made some diverse mischief far beyond the scope of
the old Packers or old Steelers:</TE>
<TE>   * This season as the Rams rolled on the arm of Warner, their
spectacular passing was the talk of the league.</TE>
<TE>   * Then in playoffs, they did it another way, with defense,
overwhelming one of the great quarterbacks of the era, Brett Favre of
Green Bay, 45-17.</TE>
<TE>   * Last week, Martz did it another way, with a ball-control running
attack starring Faulk, who kept Philadelphia's great scramble passer
Donovan McNabb off the field long enough in a 29-24 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery is which way the Ram coach will go next. All those
entranced by Martz's pass offense want Warner one more time.</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Different How?</HD>
<DH>Same Host City, Same Result; Patriots' Two Previous Super
Sundays in New Orleans Have Been Frustratingly Similar</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>There is a small corner of the city jampacked with people who think
the New England Patriots are going to win a Super Bowl at the
Superdome.</LD>
<LD>   At the corner of Decatur and St. Peter's, right in the heart of
the French Quarter, is The Corner Oyster Bar &amp; Grill. In the window
the sign says, "Danger Patriot Fans Partying." And they are.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Darr, a native of Memphis, Tenn., is the 32-year-old owner of
The Corner and a passionate Patriot fan. More than 1,000 Patriot fans
already have come to The Corner. Darr was expecting an additional
3,000 for a New England pep rally Saturday evening.</LD>
<TE>   At the pep rally, there was to be no mention of Super Bowl XX
played at the Dome.</TE>
<TE>   That game, on Jan. 26, 1986, featured William "The Refrigerator"
Perry, defensive tackle of an indeterminate weight, throwing a
rollout pass from a goal-line offense; blocking on quarterback Jim
McMahon's touchdown run and blowing linebacker Larry McGrew out of
the hole; scoring his own touchdown on a one-yard belly flop of a
dive.</TE>
<TE>   That touchdown made the score 44-3 Chicago, and if that seemed as
if the Bears were mocking the Patriots, as McMahon said after the
Bears' 46-10 victory, "Tough..."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots didn't get into a positive yardage situation until
their last possession of the third quarter. Perry had gained more
yards (one) than Patriot fullback Craig James. Perry became a folk
hero. Bear Coach Mike Ditka bragged for two weeks about how no team
could beat the Bears. McMahon filled up the French Quarter with rowdy
and very public high jinks.</TE>
<TE>   And it didn't matter. The Patriots were patsies.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't belong on the same field with the Bears in '86," said
New England fan Bobby Ferzoco of Norwell, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   A Patriot season-ticket holder since 1984, Ferzoco attended the
1986 debacle. Wearing the No. 11 jersey of quarterback Drew Bledsoe,
Ferzoco insists today's game will be different.</TE>
<TE>   "This team is a lot different," Ferzoco said. "We have a great
coach, we're unappreciated, well-disciplined and we have two all-pro
quarterbacks."</TE>
<TE>   And the Patriots are 14-point underdogs to the Rams, same as the
1986 Patriots were 14-point underdogs to the Bears.</TE>
<TE>   In that game, New England gained seven yards rushing. The
quarterbacks, Steve Grogan and Tony Eason, combined to complete 17
passes in 36 attempts. Eason had six of the attempts and none of the
completions. Before the game, Eason was called "the dullest headliner
ever to play in the Super Bowl" in one story. This was not an
inaccurate characterization.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the game, Ditka said, "There's no question who the
better football team was. You can analyze it any way you want to."</TE>
<TE>   Yep. Or, as Bear safety Gary Fencik had said: "New England took it
as an insult that we didn't take them as an equal. We proved they
aren't."</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, the Patriots were losing, 23-3, had one first down
and 19 yards of offense. Super Bowl XX most valuable player Richard
Dent had it figured out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they knew it was finished at the half," he said after the
game. "The Fat Lady was beginning to sing."</TE>
<TE>   The singing was earsplitting after the Bears scored 21
third-quarter points.</TE>
<TE>   And wouldn't you know, the Patriots' second trip to the Super Bowl
brought them back to the Superdome and into another matchup with an
NFC powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The Green Bay Packers hadn't been to the Super Bowl for 28 years
until Jan. 26, 1997. The Superdome was filled with "Cheeseheads,"
those Packer fans who wear giant foam cheese slices as headgear.
"There were three to four Cheeseheads for every Patriot fan here,"
Darr said of the Green Bay invasion.</TE>
<TE>   At least the Packers didn't score three to four times as many
points as the Patriots. The Packers beat the Patriots, 35-21.</TE>
<TE>   New England led, 14-10, after the first quarter. Keith Byars
caught a one-yard pass from Bledsoe. Tight end Ben Coates caught a
four-yard pass. Adam Vinatieri was the kicker on that team. "It was a
great first quarter," Vinatieri said. "Both offenses were so
efficient. There was a great atmosphere. It was very electric."</TE>
<TE>   It had been an electric week. Patriot Coach Bill Parcells was
involved in a very public feud with New England ownership. Parcells
was angry about many things, mostly having to do with not getting his
way on every little thing, and also with Parcells wanting very much
to escape his New England contract so he could coach the New York
Jets.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the controversy around our coach had anything to do
with the game," said Bledsoe, who completed 25 of 48 passes for 253
yards and two touchdowns. "But it did make for a very interesting
week, that's for sure. Actually, it kept a lot of the questions away
from the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   The hero of the game, the MVP, was Packer special teams player
Desmond Howard. Howard had 244 return yards. He had a 99-yard kickoff
return for a touchdown, the game's final score. It came after New
England had closed the score to 27-21 and seemed to have some
momentum.</TE>
<TE>   After he scored, Howard did one of those Heisman Trophy end-zone
poses, continuing, it seemed, the Patriot tradition of having their
Super Bowl opponents embarrass them while pounding them. Earlier in
the game, after he had caught a 54-yard Brett Favre pass for a
touchdown, Andre Rison had done the duckwalk across the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   And that somehow all seemed just. The petulant Parcells was denied
the honor of becoming the first coach to win Super Bowls with two
different teams. It was, Vinatieri said, "kind of a blow, especially
after the way the franchise had played in its first Super Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   So the Patriots are back. In the Superdome. In the Super Bowl. As
heavy, heavy underdogs.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what people were saying after we beat Pittsburgh last
week," Vinatieri said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what people are expecting from us. There's no point in
talking much about what we're going to do until we do something."</TE>

<DH>Next year: San Diego delegation says the city is ready to
play host to football's biggest event for a third time.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the revelers drawn to New Orleans for Super Bowl XXXVI, the San
Diegans are the ones with the clipboards and checklists.</LD>
<LD>   Next year the Super Bowl returns to San Diego, and a delegation
from the city is in New Orleans to see what works and what does not.</LD>
<LD>   "We're here to observe and absorb," said Sal Giametta, vice
president of the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau.</LD>
<TE>   With hundreds of millions of dollars and the city's image on the
line, San Diego has sent a blue-chip lineup of San Diego city
officials and business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   It's not entirely voluntary: The NFL requires the host city for
the next year to attend the weeklong buildup and pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a pretty good playbook going in but there is always
room for improvement," Deputy City Manager Bruce Herring said.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego played host to the Super Bowl in 1988 and 1998, the
Republican National Convention in 1996, and the national
biotechnology convention last year, all to kudos from visitors and
the traveling press. In a tourist-dependent city such as San Diego,
image is nothing to trifle with.</TE>
<TE>   Like all metropolises, San Diego has its civic quirks and
shortcomings. Political quarrels between the big city and surrounding
smaller communities are common. Estrangement between business leaders
and elected officials is endemic.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego prides itself on doing the big event as well as any city
in the land. The city is determined Super Bowl XXXVII will follow the
pattern.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing that San Diego is very good at: coordinating big
efforts," said Gayle Falkenthal, an official with the San Diego
Convention Center. "It's a real rise-to-the-occasion kind of
performance."</TE>
<TE>   A year in advance, the city has a spruce-up list for 35-year-old
Qualcomm Stadium. By kickoff time Jan. 26, 2003, the city has
pledged, among other items, to install a new sound system, renovate
the locker rooms, and make sure every seat is bright blue.</TE>
<TE>   Also, at the urging of the NFL, the city has promised 70,000
seats, not the 68,913 for the 1998 game.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the big-ticket items are considered under control in San
Diego: hotel rooms (plenty, unlike Houston and Jacksonville, which
want luxury liners to park nearby), transportation (lots of new buses
and a trolley line that goes directly to Qualcomm) and experience in
throwing parties (76% of Super Bowl visitors in 1998 visited the
Gaslamp District nightspots).</TE>
<TE>   And then there is that natural asset: the January weather.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sitting here in humid weather and we had storms the last
couple of nights," Giametta said from the city's booth in the
exhibition center at New Orleans. "San Diego is a paradise," by
comparison.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest change, of course, since 1998 involves police
protection. In the post-Sept. 11 environment, the U.S. Secret Service
and Homeland Security forces have asserted control of law enforcement
inside the Louisiana Superdome.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that will be the case next year at Qualcomm is unknown,
Herring said. San Diego police officials are in New Orleans to watch
the coordination of the 40 federal, state and local agencies
involved.</TE>
<TE>   For the GOP convention and the biotechnology convention, both
occasions when thousands of protesters came to San Diego, the city
ordered a virtual full mobilization of its police force. There were
few arrests and no disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   If security is different from the last time the Super Bowl came to
San Diego, one thing is just the same. Local organizers have been
unabashed in confronting the issue, a perennial in Super Bowl cities.</TE>
<TE>   At an early meeting with volunteers pledged to help Super Bowl
XXXVII go smoothly, beer distributing executive Ron Fowler, chairman
of the city's Super Bowl host committee, made one thing clear:</TE>
<TE>   "There are no extra tickets. Don't ask."</TE>

<HD>Fox Picks Patriotism For Big Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's fitting that one of the teams playing in today's Super Bowl is
named the Patriots. Super Bowl XXXVI's theme is "Heroes, Hope and
Homeland," and patriotism will be everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   It will dominate Fox television's pregame coverage, which will
include appearances by former presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford,
George Bush and Bill Clinton, plus Nancy Reagan.</LD>
<LD>   It's also fitting that the Patriots are often called the Pats,
because at the end of an emotionally charged day, just before Fox
goes off the air, there will be a special tribute to Pat Summerall.</LD>
<TE>   After 50 years of being involved with the NFL as a player and
broadcaster, Summerall, 71, is stepping down as Fox's lead
play-by-play announcer.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall has said he doesn't want any fuss made over him, but
there's going to be one, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Fox hasn't said much about what it plans to do, but it has been
learned it's not simply going to be, "See ya later, Pat."</TE>
<TE>   Fox asked two of its top producers, Gary Lang and Fran Morison, to
put together a piece. In it will be film of Summerall kicking a
dramatic 49-yard field goal in the snow, giving the New York Giants a
13-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns in the last game of the
regular season in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   That win threw the Giants and Browns into a playoff for the
Eastern Conference title. The Giants won the playoff game, 10-0, then
went on to their meeting with the Baltimore Colts in the monumental
1958 championship game, sometimes called "the greatest game ever
played."</TE>
<TE>   Summerall will be given a plaque commemorating that key field
goal, incorporating part of the goal post.</TE>
<TE>   After the Summerall tribute, there will be additional postgame
coverage on Fox Sports Net with the Fox pregame crew.</TE>
<TE>   As for the three-hour pregame show on Fox, which starts at noon,
the overlying theme will be patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   And because of Sept. 11, the show featuring James Brown, Terry
Bradshaw, Howie Long and Cris Collinsworth will be more subdued than
usual.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally, we'll be sensitive to the entire theme of the show,"
Bradshaw said.</TE>
<TE>   The patriotic emotions should reach a peak during the final
half-hour, mainly because of the piece featuring the former
presidents and Nancy Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has kept it under wraps, but David Hill, Fox Sports chairman,
offered a sneak preview to a reporter at Fox studios in Los Angeles
last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The moving piece was three months in the making.</TE>
<TE>   The presidents and Mrs. Reagan read the words from Aaron Copland's
"Lincoln Portrait," a stirring blend of words and music put together
not long after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Pops, performing live on the field, provide the music
for the segment.</TE>
<TE>   The piece also includes shots from such American landmarks as the
Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam Memorial and Arlington Cemetery. The
segment ends with recent and dramatic footage from Ground Zero and
portraits of two New York City firefighters who were killed in the
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   This segment was produced by Ronit Larone, Gary Lang's wife.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the segment sprang from a meeting Hill had with NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. Joe Browne, NFL senior vice president of
communications, served as a liaison to set up the filming of the four
presidents and Mrs. Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Larone remembers getting an e-mail from Hill in October saying,
"Have I got a project for you."</TE>
<TE>   The first step was getting everybody to agree to do it, then
scheduling filming sessions with each. Carter was first, in Atlanta.
Then Ford at the Marriott resort in Palm Desert. Bush was taped in
Florida when he was in Boca Raton for a Rotary Club speech.</TE>
<TE>   Larone said Clinton was the hardest to schedule but was finally
filmed in Los Angeles, at the Sheraton Universal hotel on Jan. 14,
before giving a speech there that night.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Reagan was taped two days later at the Bel-Air Hotel, and
she agreed to do it only after asking that the script be reworked.</TE>
<TE>   "Her role was to fill in for her husband and she didn't think her
part fit that role," Larone said. "She was right, and we had to do
some rewriting."</TE>
<TE>   Larone, 34, is from Manhattan. She used to live a mile north of
the World Trade Center, and she lost friends in the tragedy. "My
first idea after getting this assignment was to end the piece with
footage of Ground Zero filmed from a helicopter," Larone said. "It
took a lot of work to get clearance because of the two-mile no-fly
zone, and it was the last thing we shot."</TE>
<TE>   It was worth the trouble. It provides a dramatic ending to an
emotion-packed piece that will be a big part of what should be an
emotional day.</TE>
<TE>   The pregame show's finale will have Paul McCartney's "Freedom."</TE>
<TE>   "Super Bowl Sunday has become an American holiday, much like
Thanksgiving," said Hill, the 55-year-old Australian who has adapted
well to the United States since coming here eight years ago to start
Fox Sports and is now as Americanized as they come.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only fitting, in the light of the events that took place on
Sept. 11, that patriotism be a major part of our coverage," he said.</TE>

<LD>I am a mother and schoolteacher. My entire life revolves around the
protection and growth of our children. I care deeply about the
community in which my children and my students will be raised. We
must provide for our children the safest and best community we can. I
have known Ron Bamieh for years. I have seen him put away wife
beaters, rapists and skinhead murderers.</LD>
<LD>   With every victory, my respect for Ron has grown. I believe that
he is truly a man who protects our community.</LD>
<LD>   I cannot help but feel that if every prosecutor worked as hard as
Ron Bamieh, our community would be rid of criminals.</LD>
<TE>   Now that we have the chance to elect him as our district attorney,
we should not hesitate to vote for him and ensure the safety of our
children for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Valerie Zeko</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Bamieh is outdistancing his opponent by nearly 2 to 1 in
raising campaign funds. But follow the money trail. His money is
coming from his father in San Mateo, a Texas oil tycoon, a former
presidential candidate, a former national security advisor and a
couple of former ambassadors, among other out-of-state people. I
don't think for a moment they are interested or really care about
D.A. services to the people of Ventura County. It sure appears Mr.
Bamieh is just using this as an attempt to buy an office, drop
Ventura County in a term or so, and push off into bigger and better
personal political adventures in Sacramento or even Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Totten's campaign contributors are very much Ventura County
citizens. Citizens who want our D.A. to continue to uphold the high
standards set by Mike Bradbury. Greg will perform his duties in a
first-class manner and will listen to our needs, not those from out
of state.</TE>
<TE>   I want a person who is interested in Ventura County, who will be
here for us. Not a candidate with a flashy strategist from New York
who has worked on campaigns for out-of-state governors and senators,
and even an Israeli prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   We are talking about a D.A. for Ventura County, not someone
running for office out of state.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Totten is absolutely the clear choice for D.A. for Ventura
County.</TE>

<LD>Somewhere in our neighborhood a dedicated patriot is calling us all
to attention. In the several blocks bounded roughly by Aurora Drive,
Elmhurst, Bucknell and Wake Forest, we all have the opportunity to
listen to a patriotic medley played intermittently from before dawn
to after midnight or 1 a.m. with unpredictable pauses. What sounds
like an electronic organ plays "The Star-Spangled Banner," "God Bless
America" and "America The Beautiful" over and over.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine the dedication of our patriot to maintain this medley
every day and night since sometime in October last year! Imagine the
stamina required for nearly 24-hour-a-day duty! Consider the
sacrifice in increased electrical bills!</LD>
<LD>   Shouldn't this person come forward to accept our recognition?
Despite the apparent modesty, shouldn't his neighbors be able to
offer the public notice his perseverance merits?</LD>
<TE>   It would be a shame if such a patriot is only recognized by the
gendarmes enforcing the Noise Abatement Ordinance after 10 p.m.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Afghans Test-Drive Democracy and Hit Bumps</HD>
<DH>Politics: Emigres at a meeting in Laguna Hills find it's no
easy task electing an advisory council but vow to prove factions can
coexist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone wondering why it's been so difficult launching a new
government in Afghanistan need look no further than the Pacific Hills
Banquet Hall in southern Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The 1,000 Afghan refugees from Southern California who showed up
for a meeting last week shared a desire to take part in the
rebuilding of their homeland. But that was all they shared.</LD>
<LD>   Within minutes, the meeting was over, with no vote cast for
representatives to an advisory council. There were reports of
shouting, a little bit of shoving, accusations that one speaker was a
Taliban supporter (he denied it), even hair pulling among a few
women. In the end, nobody was arrested and nobody was hurt, but
sheriff's deputies had to help disperse the crowd.</LD>
<TE>   Filled with noble intentions to elect local representatives,
Afghans in the United States are instead receiving a history lesson
in the often messy business called democracy. The process has made
them confront the tribal and political divisions that survive even
here, thousands of miles from the strife in their ancestral country.</TE>
<TE>   "The country has been in war for 23 years and it's been
difficult," said Hasan Nouri of Laguna Hills, an organizer of last
week's failed election in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of it filters here. There are sympathizers of the Taliban.
Sympathizers of the Communist Party. We have Northern Alliance. We
have Pashtun. That unfortunate characteristic of Afghanistan is also
evident here ....The word 'retreat' is nonexistent in the Afghan
vocabulary. And retreat is necessary in democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Similar scenes have occurred in other Afghan immigrant
communities.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, tempers flared and voices were raised at an
election. A vote in Fremont, Calif., dragged on for eight hours and
was criticized afterward by people who felt not everyone was fairly
represented. Organizers in Washington, D.C., are wondering what will
happen today, when more than 1,000 people are expected at an
election.</TE>
<TE>   ''What we're trying to do is take the initial steps of democracy,"
said Hamed Etebar of Virginia, one of the organizers. "This process
is painful and the road is long. But we are very hopeful that all
Afghans, after seeing their country desolate and destroyed for 23
years, will come together and become one Afghanistan.''</TE>
<TE>   When the votes are complete in four areas across the United
States, Afghans hope to have a 40-member national council, one that
will act as the community's unified voice in the U.S. to lobby for
aid and offer advice about setting up a new Afghan government.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Afghans said they plan to try again, learning
from last Sunday's mistakes, when the meeting fell into disarray even
before it was officially convened with a reading from the Koran.
Hundreds squeezed into a room too small to accommodate the crowd.
Hundreds more congregated outside, unable to hear. Speakers grabbed
for the microphone. Private security guards removed at least two men
from the Laguna Hills banquet hall, setting off a fresh round of
complaints. Some, like Afghanistan Mirror expatriate magazine
publisher Sayed Hashemeyan of Montclair, complained of
"profiling"--alleging that dissenters were purposely kept out.</TE>
<TE>   Many do not understand the reason for the election. Some thought
they were selecting delegates to meet President Bush and interim
Afghan leader Hamid Karzai. Others thought if they were elected to
this council, they could be considered for a spot in the Afghanistan
loya jirga process. A loya jirga, or grand council, is to be convened
in Afghanistan to draft a constitution and rules for electing a
permanent government.</TE>
<TE>   Hashemeyan brought a list of questions, numbered and written in
Farsi, to the Southern California election. Item number seven, he
said, read, "What is the necessity of this election? Why are we doing
it? What is the purpose? What is the rush?"</TE>
<TE>   There is no rush, organizers said, except that for the first time
in 23 years, they see hope for their old country. Democracy is
something they want for Afghanistan. It is something they want to
practice here to show the world that it is possible to bring a
divided community to unity, even if the process is painful and
painstaking.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the Taliban crumbles and the popular exiled Afghanistan
king takes a back seat to Karzai, old alliances die hard.</TE>
<TE>   As Zohra Daoud of Malibu put it, "Some people are holding onto
their grudges."</TE>
<TE>   Some said the process of coming together is difficult not so much
because of grudges but because there is a lack of information. Hasan
Aliyar, president of the Aryana Cultural Center in San Diego,
boycotted the meeting in Orange County and fired off a critical
letter to an Afghan newspaper and to government officials, saying
that he has no idea who organized the election or why.</TE>
<TE>   Another San Diego resident, Sakhi Ashrafzai, criticized the group
for being self-appointed and said residents in Northern California,
New York and Virginia are also complaining about "such clandestine
events."</TE>
<TE>   But Nouri and Noor Delawari of La Canada Flintridge said the
meetings have been well-advertised. They accused critics of being
pro-Taliban and bent on derailing the process.</TE>
<TE>   Hashemeyan, once a Taliban sympathizer, said he has revoked his
Taliban support and just wants to ensure an open election.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan immigrants in New York and Northern California--the two
regions that have successfully elected their 10 representatives--also
complained that not enough people knew about the voting.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers said they did their best to publicize elections. They
advertised on Afghan radio and in some Afghan publications, sent mass
e-mailings and distributed fliers at Afghan restaurants and markets.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, with religious differences, family rivalries, ethnic
divisions between the Pashtun and Tajik tribes, and conflicts between
the old and young, it's no wonder there has been dissension.</TE>
<TE>   Maliha Zulfacar, a sociologist at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, said
the Southern California Afghans are particularly "clannish," with
members of three prominent and large families taking part in the
election.</TE>
<TE>   There is an established generation that has been active in the
U.S. for 20 or 30 years, she said, as well as newcomer immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people will say that this has no legality," said Dr. Bashir
Zikria, a New Jersey surgeon who organized the election in New York.
"But it is our right to elect our representatives for any reason we
want to, even if there is no precedent about it. Nobody has to give
us the right. We are free citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Sayed Massood Majrooh, 51, of Fremont was elected last month in
Northern California. Despite the criticism, he said, "We are striving
for unification." The complaints, he added, are not among "the
orderly people."</TE>
<TE>   Like many other Afghans who have watched the destruction of their
country, Nouri, the organizer of the event in Laguna Hills, has an
image burned on his mind. It was 1984 after the Soviet Union bombed a
village in Afghanistan, where Nouri was operating a medical clinic. A
doctor brought back a firsthand account. He found only three
survivors--an old man, a 3-year-old child and a baby. The 3-year-old
was feeding the baby through the breasts of his dead mother, Nouri
said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the rest of my life, I'm not going to stop until justice is
done and peace is brought," Nouri said. "I cannot let it go."</TE>

<HD>The Powerful Weapon Shawn Boyd's Foes Have: Shawn Boyd</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA PARSONS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember how indignant Shawn Boyd sounded last September?</LD>
<LD>   In so many words and in no particular order, this is what he said:</LD>
<LD>   Political opponents were out to get him.</LD>
<TE>   He'd love to say more so he could clear his name, but his lawyer
advised against it.</TE>
<TE>   This was all much ado about nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Now here we are in early February, a month before Boyd is up for
reelection to the Seal Beach City Council, and he's got the district
attorney's office on his tail.</TE>
<TE>   From what prosecutors have said so far, it's Seal Beach voters who
ought to be indignant.</TE>
<TE>   The issue last year was why Boyd, 33, a first-term councilman,
hadn't revealed his business connections with a trailer-park owner
with whom the council was negotiating. By way of city-backed bonds
and a state grant, Seal Beach essentially was financing the sale of
the trailer park to a nonprofit corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd cast several votes in favor of the deal and abstained on some
others, but never disclosed he had other business dealings pending
with park owner Richard Hall. Boyd's weak rationale at the time was
that those dealings involved projects outside Seal Beach that hadn't
materialized, and, consequently, he hadn't been paid by Hall for any
of them.</TE>
<TE>   That stretched credulity, but many of us are charitable and
contemplated the possibility it</TE>
<TE>   was just a goof by a rookie councilman.</TE>
<TE>   I offered the helpful notion back then that Mr. Boyd had a blind
spot.</TE>
<TE>   The kicker, however, came last week when the district attorney's
office said it has documents indicating Boyd had received more than
$100,000 in previously undisclosed payments from Hall during the
period in which he voted on the trailer-park issues.</TE>
<TE>   If true, that's a much different story than the one Boyd was
telling last fall.</TE>
<TE>   State law prohibits elected officials who have received $250 or
more in income within the previous year from voting or influencing
decisions for the next 12 months on matters that could financially
benefit the giver.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the put-upon councilman looks like a fairly calculating
political operative.</TE>
<TE>   The normally loquacious Boyd wasn't talking publicly last week,
and maybe he's spending his time thinking up an answer to a fairly
simple question: Why didn't he</TE>
<TE>   tell anyone he'd been paid by</TE>
<TE>   Hall during the period when the trailer park issue was before the
council?</TE>
<TE>   Couldn't find the words? How about: "I'm abstaining on any and all
trailer-park matters because I've got a couple potentially lucrative
outside business ventures with Mr. Hall, and I want to eliminate any
potential conflict of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Boyd said he thought revealing his connection to Hall
might be used against him in this spring's election.</TE>
<TE>   Little did he know. His connection to Hall will be used against
him, all right, but not the way he imagined.</TE>
<TE>   That is, no one is alleging that Hall bought Boyd's vote on the
trailer-park issue. Nor is there anything wrong with Boyd brokering
real estate deals with Hall outside Seal Beach.</TE>
<TE>   What everybody wants to know now is what Boyd's refusal to come
clean says about how he conducts his public life. Is he that
deceitful or that dumb? Boyd's vote didn't make the difference on the
trailer-park issue, so why the hidden-ball trick?</TE>
<TE>   Boyd is verging dangerously into territory already claimed by Dave
Garofalo in neighboring Huntington Beach. Garofalo long protested his
innocence before resigning last month. He then pleaded guilty to one
felony and 15 misdemeanor charges involving conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   It's perfectly possible that Boyd's votes on the Hall-related
business before the Seal Beach council were squeaky clean. The ins
and outs of his involvement in that transaction will be part of the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But now that we learn that Boyd was cashing checks from Hall--even
as the trailer-park issue was on the docket--a whole new round of
questions emerge.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, the victim strategy won't work.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, Boyd appears keenly prescient about only one thing
he said last fall: That his political opponents were out to get him.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, they are. And the best weapon they have at their
disposal seems to be Boyd himself.</TE>

<HD>Robert D. West, 82; Rescued From Ship at Pearl Harbor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert D. West, who was among 32 men rescued from the bottom of the
capsized battleship Oklahoma after the attack on Pearl Harbor and was
aboard the battleship Massachusetts when it pounded Japan at the end
of World War II, has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   West, who for many years owned West Interiors, a carpet and
drapery business in West Covina, died Jan. 14 at his home in San Juan
Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   He suffered from emphysema, and the likely cause of death was lung
cancer, his family said.</LD>
<TE>   When West's seven daughters were growing up after the war, their
soft-spoken, dry-witted father never talked to them about the nearly
30 hours he spent entombed in the Oklahoma after it was struck by
Japanese torpedoes and capsized.</TE>
<TE>   But when he discussed his experience in a 1966 interview with Life
magazine for an issue marking the 25th anniversary of the attack on
Pearl Harbor, they finally understood why their father always slept
with a small light on.</TE>
<TE>   "They had been trapped in pitch darkness, and I think that
[memory] never totally left him," said West's daughter, Diane, of
Corona del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago in 1920, West was 2 when his father died. He and
his mother went on relief and moved in with West's grandmother, who
later taught him to play the piano.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Depression hit, West's mother had remarried.
West's stepfather was a sign painter and occasional saxophonist who
taught the boy to play the instrument.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937--at 17--West dropped out of high school and enlisted in
the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, West, a musician second class, was aboard the
cruiser Raleigh, which operated in and out of Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   West, however, cared neither for the high cost of beer in Honolulu
nor the way the locals treated sailors.</TE>
<TE>   So during the summer of 1941, amid rumors that battleships would
be returning to the West Coast, he received permission to trade jobs
with a sailor on the Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   But with growing tension between the United States and Japan, the
battleships remained in Pearl Harbor. On that infamous Sunday morning
in December 1941, West and 21 other band members were assembled on
the Oklahoma's main deck preparing to play "The Star-Spangled Banner"
during the raising of the colors at 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   They never played.</TE>
<TE>   About 7:55, as West recalled in a reminiscence he wrote for the
USS Arizona Memorial, he noticed a swarm of planes coming in high off
the port side of battleship row.</TE>
<TE>   Thinking that the planes were conducting maneuvers, West commented
to a colleague that he didn't realize they had so many aircraft in
the area. When one of the planes dropped a bomb on Ford Island, West
said to his shipmate, "That sure looks like the real McCoy."</TE>
<TE>   Then a fast, low-flying plane dropped a bomb on the minelayer
Oglala on the other side of the channel. At the same moment that the
Oglala seemed "to fold like an accordion from bow to stern," a voice
came over the Oklahoma's loudspeaker ordering all hands to their
battle stations.</TE>
<TE>   As the men scattered in different directions, West took off for
his battle station--a damage control unit in the carpenter shop on
the third deck below.</TE>
<TE>   West, according to the Life magazine account, had only recently
been transferred to that station--as punishment after being caught
playing a card game called acey-deucy during a practice General
Quarters drill.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer saved his life: Everyone manning his former battle
station was killed during the first minutes of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The first torpedo ripped into the Oklahoma just as West finished
tightening the latches on the watertight door leading to the
carpenter shop compartment.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion caused the ship to immediately list to port. Seconds
later, another torpedo hit, making the vessel list so much that a
fellow sailor had to toss West a line so he could pull himself up to
get to the high side of the compartment.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the ship had been hit by two more torpedoes, West and
about a dozen men were in a passageway leading out of the carpenter
shop. A fifth, then a sixth, torpedo hit, and the ship was now
listing at least 90 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "One more hit," West said to the young sailor in front of him,
"and we're going over."</TE>
<TE>   When a seventh torpedo hit, the ship rolled over and, West
recalled, "the water rushed in like a flood. To the knees, the waist,
the neck, to having to tread water and suddenly [the water went] no
higher. The Okie had capsized and settled in the mud of the harbor
and left us with about a foot of air space."</TE>
<TE>   About half of the group had already left the passageway through a
hatch that had not been closed.</TE>
<TE>   But West and the other four remaining sailors could no longer see
the now-submerged door, so each man dove under and swam up to the
other side.</TE>
<TE>   In the semi-darkness, eerily lighted by the glow of
phosphorescence stirred up by the onrushing water, they could make
out a long ladder, whose steps led to what had once been the bottom
of the ship and that was now the top.</TE>
<TE>   They climbed onto the ladder and waited.</TE>
<TE>   With ocean water continuing to pour in, the five men decided to
see what was at the top of the ladder. They found a sealed,
watertight door.</TE>
<TE>   After breaking a heavy padlock, they entered a dark, seemingly
spacious area.</TE>
<TE>   West and another sailor, Bert Crenshaw, walked and crawled until
they reached the bulkhead on the opposite side of the compartment.</TE>
<TE>   The three others in the group were about 15 feet away, but they
had no way of knowing for sure: They were enveloped in complete
darkness, and there they remained.</TE>
<TE>   Every so often, they would holler and count off.</TE>
<TE>   And as long as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 was heard, West recalled, "We knew
that everything was OK and it was dry."</TE>
<TE>   West remembered that it was easy to doze off, probably because of
low oxygen. But they had no way of telling whether they were asleep
for 10 minutes or two hours. And, thirsty after having swallowed oily
sea water, West thought of the glasses of water he had turned down at
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   When he was awake, West would pound on the bulkhead with his
wrench.</TE>
<TE>   After hours of repeated pounding, he finally heard an answer.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers, who had begun cutting through the ship's double
bottom the morning of the attack, were systematically working their
way through the bowels of the capsized vessel searching for
survivors.</TE>
<TE>   As water began lapping at the entombed sailors' feet, the rescuers
started cutting a hole just above where West and another sailor sat.</TE>
<TE>   The five weakened, oil-soaked sailors were lifted out and guided
through an escape route. At 2 p.m., the day after the attack, they
finally saw daylight.</TE>
<TE>   But the joy of being rescued quickly dimmed once they saw the
devastation of battleship row, West recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The Oklahoma was one of 21 American ships destroyed or damaged in
the attack, which killed 2,388 people and wounded about 2,000.</TE>
<TE>   West and the four other sailors were seated in a motor launch,
given an apple and coffee with brandy, and taken to a hospital ship.</TE>
<TE>   Although 32 men trapped inside the Oklahoma were rescued Dec. 8
and 9, tapping from those unable to be saved continued to be heard
through the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 20 of the Oklahoma's officers and 395 enlisted men were
reported either killed or missing.</TE>
<TE>   West and the other four sailors he was trapped with all survived
the war.</TE>
<TE>   And West, who had been there for the beginning of America's
involvement, also was there for its end--as a crew member on the
Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   West had spent most of the war on shore duty--he helped establish
a Navy training station in Maryland. But he was assigned to the
Massachusetts in March 1945.</TE>
<TE>   The battleship was among the first to bombard the Japanese home
shores--revenge of sorts for what West and his fellow shipmates had
experienced more than three years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "[Adm.] Halsey kept saying, 'Remember Pearl Harbor,'" West told
Life, "but I was trying to forget it."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, West moved to Philadelphia, where he had met his
first wife, Betty, a few years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   He worked as a salesman, first selling encyclopedias and then pots
and pans door to door.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, he and his family moved to Los Angeles, where he
continued to work as a salesman before starting his home interior
business in West Covina.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Diane, West is survived by his second wife, Mary;
six other daughters, Elizabeth Peoples of Agoura Hills, Cathy Barnes
of Santa Ana, Patricia Olivieri of Laguna Hills, Joanne Benschop of
San Juan Capistrano, Marianne Middlekauff of San Clemente and Barbara
Higginbotham of Mission Viejo; a stepdaughter, Cheryl Holguin of
Irvine; 13 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.</TE>

<HD>Agency Takes a Bite Out of Housing Police</HD>
<DH>Crime: Night patrols are ending at 15 projects in L.A. and
the force may be disbanded as funds are shifted to overdue repairs.
Residents are worried.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY  and HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a jump in serious crime at city-run housing for the poor, the
Los Angeles Housing Authority has halved its police budget and is
ending overnight patrols, citing a shortage of funds.</LD>
<LD>   The authority's police force may be disbanded altogether at the
end of the year unless new money can be found to replace expiring
grants, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The cutbacks trouble many of the thousands of residents who say
they already feel vulnerable at the city's 15 housing projects. And
representatives of the Los Angeles Police Department concede that it
won't be easy for them to pick up the slack inside the crowded
complexes, where they have clashed with tenants in the past.</LD>
<TE>   Donald J. Smith, the Housing Authority's executive director, said
he is struggling to maintain the agency's police presence. "It's a
funding issue," he said. "I simply don't have the funding."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has moved to
cut the public housing drug-elimination program nationwide, which has
provided housing authorities with $309 million annually that could be
used for policing, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, the cuts have affected several agencies, including the
housing authorities of Ventura County, which serves 600 low-income
residents, and of Los Angeles County, which serves about 3,600
families.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, HUD has mandated that the Los Angeles Housing
Authority redirect money to maintenance that had been diverted for
many years to policing, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   HUD spokeswoman Nancy Segerdahl said policing reductions should
not be blamed on the federal agency. Although it cut the
drug-elimination program, an equal amount of money was added to
operating funds for housing authorities, which can be used for
everything from repairing housing to policing, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, HUD does not mandate how the money is spent, she
said, leaving it up to the housing authorities, although they must
maintain housing as habitable.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the requirement to address deferred maintenance is what
caused him to switch funds from policing to repairs.</TE>
<TE>   The federal money was meant to augment, not be a substitute for,
local funding of police departments serving housing developments, HUD
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   That is the message Los Angeles housing officials received from
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD is responsible for enforcing the law in public housing,"
said Smith, who oversees an agency operating 15 major housing
developments that are home to 22,500 low-income people.</TE>
<TE>   Agency's Officers Built Rapport With Residents</TE>
<TE>   Residents denounced the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "We have enough problems as it is," said Sandra Obando, president
of the San Fernando Gardens residents council. "We don't need them
taking our Housing Authority police away. We don't feel safe."</TE>
<TE>   Southeast area housing projects, particularly Jordan Downs, were
the site of several attacks against LAPD officers by crowds last
summer. Most of those occurred as officers tried to make arrests.</TE>
<TE>   One benefit of the Housing Authority police program, some said, is
that those officers built a rapport with residents.</TE>
<TE>   George Holt, president of the union representing the agency's
supervisory officers, called it a "terrible idea" to reduce patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the LAPD would like to provide some help, they can't
do it. They don't have the officers," he said. "The residents are
going to pay the price."</TE>
<TE>   Holt said most crime is committed overnight, when authority
officers will not be on patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the LAPD is prepared to assume a greater role in the
housing developments. But some officials in the department are
concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "Without their helping at night, it's going to get worse," said
Julian Almaraz, the LAPD senior lead officer assigned to San Fernando
Gardens. "At least they [authority officers] keep tabs on the people
there."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Gannon, a captain formerly in charge of the LAPD's
Southeast Division, acknowledged that Housing Authority officers
played an important role in reducing tension.</TE>
<TE>   "Did we come to rely on them? Yes, we did," said Gannon, who now
works in the LAPD's Internal Affairs Group. He said the department
has counted on Housing Authority officers for "things maybe we should
have been doing."</TE>
<TE>   "They constantly were on top of that; they worked that
relationship [with residents]," Gannon said. "You need the ability to
know who to talk to, rather than get into a large melee."</TE>
<TE>   The Southeast Division has taken some steps to improve
relationships with residents in five of the most troubled housing
projects. It has called numerous community meetings and established a
Neighborhood Police Academy, which offers workshops designed to help
officers and tenants better understand each other.</TE>
<TE>   Major Crime at Projects Soared 16.7% Last Year</TE>
<TE>   Authorities and residents alike say the need for a police presence
is clear.</TE>
<TE>   Major crime at the city's public housing projects jumped 16.7%
last year. Arson and vandalism doubled in the same period. In
contrast, the increase in serious crime for the city overall was 7%.</TE>
<TE>   "Mothers are afraid to let their children play outside," said
Paula Rangel, a Pacoima community activist.</TE>
<TE>   She, Obando and others protested the Housing Commission's decision
last week to cut the budget for the agency's Public Safety Department
from $10 million last year to $4.9 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Staffing was cut from 63 sworn officers last year to 41 this year,
including the elimination of 21 positions that were vacant because of
recruitment difficulties. The authority had 78 officers six years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The new budget eliminated the position of the public safety
director, forcing Raymond Palacios to retire last week, and did away
with two lieutenants and three sergeants.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new plan, each of the 15 projects will be assigned two
sworn Housing Authority officers. They will work shifts, usually
beginning at 10 a.m., as community policing liaisons, collecting
information from residents about crime problems that will primarily
be addressed by the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   At Jordan Downs in Watts, residents said they have noticed the
reduction of Housing Authority police in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on a bench near the recreation center as her two small
children cavorted on playground equipment, Esther Munoz, 29, said the
last thing the project needs is fewer officers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not enough police officers," she said, adding that her
home has been burglarized three times--most recently as she hid in
the bathroom. Gang activity at night has kept her family indoors.</TE>
<TE>   At last week's meeting, residents of San Fernando Gardens
complained that the cuts come as many question the use of contracted
security guards. They cited the Jan. 8 arrest of a former guard who
police allege was a member of the Pacoima Project Boys, a gang that
has terrorized the 2,000-resident housing development he was paid to
protect.</TE>
<TE>   Authority officers are armed, sworn police officers who are
employees of the housing agency. The security guards are unarmed and
work under contract with the authority.</TE>
<TE>   The arrested guard, who was fired Nov. 11 after more than a year
on the job, was served Oct. 4 with a gang injunction for alleged
membership in the Pacoima Project Boys. He was arrested  last month
on suspicion of violating the injunction, which prohibited gang
members from associating in public. But the city attorney decided not
to file charges, saying there was not enough evidence to prove the
association with another gang member.</TE>
<TE>   Another security guard, at Estrada Courts in Boyle Heights, was
arrested  last month on suspicion of cocaine possession, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Housing Authority manager Lucille Loyce said the responsibility
for hiring the alleged gang member rests with the residents council,
which includes Obando and other tenants.</TE>

<HD>Telling a Thousand Tales of California</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER H. KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>   What is your California story, the man asked, and for a moment I
was stumped. I knew the sort of story Jim Quay was after: the kind of
tales found in the journals of '49ers and subsequently told by wave
after wave of migrants into California, by railroad laborers and
raisin moguls, by fruit tramps and World War II factory hands,
stories of passage--sometimes triumphant, sometimes bitterly
difficult--into the promised land.</LD>
<LD>   Quay is executive director of the California Council for the
Humanities. This nonprofit organization, in its quarter-century
campaign to explain California to Californians, has underwritten and
staged an array of cultural and historical projects throughout the
state.</LD>
<TE>   At present the council is gearing up for an ambitious effort
titled: "My Story Is California's Story." The idea, Quay was saying
over lunch, is to elicit, through a variety of programs, personal
stories from Californians that, once collected and woven together,
will tell the larger story of California itself.</TE>
<TE>   "We have found," Quay said, "that when people tell their stories,
and other people listen to their stories, it creates a trust that
strengthens communities. We also have found that occasions for this
kind of storytelling have to be created deliberately; they don't
happen naturally."</TE>
<TE>   It was at about this point in the conversation that Quay created
the occasion for me to tell my California story. Unfortunately, no
great narratives run through my family history--no treks by wagon
through snow-covered Sierra passes, no journey in overloaded jalopies
out Route 66, no mad dashes across the border to the promise of the
north.</TE>
<TE>   I considered telling Quay the story about my dad's father, a
Fresno detective who holed up inside an Oakland bank vault for
something like 60 days, watching through a peephole for a robber
named "The Owl" to show up and deposit his loot. When at last his
prey entered the bank, my grandfather walked up behind the culprit
and stuck a gun in his ribs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all over, Owl," he said.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure, however, what that story says about California. I
also flashed for a moment on the story of my Uncle Dumpy and his
Saroyanesque misadventure with a toy arrow. To liven up a family
party one night, this young uncle had licked the suction cup at the
arrow's business end and stuck it on his forehead.</TE>
<TE>   It was funny, until he started trying to pull off the arrow.</TE>
<TE>   The cup would not release. Other relatives began to tug at the
arrow with no success. My uncle's forehead, meanwhile, began to turn
red, and then purple.</TE>
<TE>   For a while there, it looked like Uncle Dumpy's whole brain might
somehow be sucked into that rubber arrowhead.</TE>
<TE>   "Man Devoured by Deadly Suction Cup," the headline would read in
the Fresno Bee the next day.</TE>
<TE>   I was quite young at the time, and I don't recall how the arrow
finally was removed. But Uncle Dumpy, whose real name is Dale, did
survive--which robbed the drama of its climax, perhaps, but kept
alive my only uncle.</TE>
<TE>   Another Dumpy story: Not too long after the arrow incident, he
moved to Los Angeles, where he drove a truck.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, he brought his family back to Fresno, where he
more than once described how, stuck in his truck one weekday morning
on one of L.A.'s freeways, hemmed in and not going anywhere, he
decided on the spot that he simply couldn't handle the big city
anymore. He quit his job that afternoon and retreated back over the
hill to Fresno--another kind of California story, perhaps, but again
not exactly Steinbeck material.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, I mumbled something to Quay about my grandmother from
Bluejacket, Okla., and left it at that. Fortunately for the council's
storytelling projects, a significant number of Californians come
better stocked with material.</TE>
<TE>   In a survey conducted for the council last spring, nearly 44% of
those Californians polled stated that they or a family member have a
personal story that is "part of California's story" and worth sharing
with the rest of the state. Of those, three out of four responded
that their family stories involved coming into California from
another nation or state.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the survey respondents couldn't contain themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of simply saying they had a story about their
grandmother," Quay said, "they started telling the story right there
on the phone."</TE>
<TE>   They told stories, he said, of ancestors who came to California to
find gold or escape civil war, who came to take part in great
construction projects, who wound up in internment camps.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather came in the Depression," said one respondent,
"because he was starving in Oklahoma."</TE>
<TE>   Some passed along family stories of relatives who traveled to
California from Europe by ocean liner and transcontinental rail,
while others spoke of kin who made their passage in a more humble
fashion: crawling under barbed wire at the border.</TE>
<TE>   "The variety and the compelling nature of just these fragments,"
Quay said, "told us that we have got treasures out there. There are
great stories out there, and they deserve to be gathered, and they
deserve to be told."</TE>
<TE>   Just how these stories are to be collected, and in what forums
they might be presented, will be determined later this year, after
the council solicits and weighs proposals from community groups
throughout California. In time, though, the question Quay asked me is
to be put to every interested Californian: What is your California
story?</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, it does not involve antic uncles with rubber arrows
stuck to their foreheads.</TE>
<TE>   That one's been taken.</TE>

<HD>The Mean Streets of Santa Cruz</HD>
<DH>Seaside city sees itself as a compassionate place. But
homeless advocates say its anti-camping, loitering laws are too
harsh.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ</DL>
<LD>People here are proud to be different. The mayor wears bluejeans, the
police prefer sushi to doughnuts and the university chose the lowly
banana slug as its mascot.</LD>
<LD>   Call them iconoclastic. Call them wacky. Just don't call them
hardhearted. Since a national coalition of homeless groups did just
that last month, this seaside city of 55,000 has been engaged in a
round of self-examination unseen since people here learned the Dalai
Lama eats meat.</LD>
<LD>   "I think this is an incredibly compassionate city," said Mayor
Christopher Krohn. The $2.23 million the city spends on social
services, he said, is a larger portion of the city budget than in
Berkeley, with its international reputation for tolerance.</LD>
<TE>   If you go down to Pacific Street, however, and talk to Free Bird
or Zoe--"just Zoe"--you get a different opinion. Zoe, 22, said she
was ticketed for sitting on the grass. Free Bird, 21, has been on the
road four years and he's never seen a place like this.</TE>
<TE>   The Wisconsin native said he's been to San Francisco, Flagstaff,
Ariz., Florida, and too many other places to count. "Santa Cruz seems
like the worst," he said. "It looks like they push the homeless
around to satisfy the people with money."</TE>
<TE>   So who's right? Maybe both sides are. If you go by the homeless
office--yes the homeless have an office here, donated by the city--or
talk to the homeless' police officer--they have a cop devoted just to
outreach to the homeless, a man who was once homeless--you can't help
but be impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "In L.A., do you have a homeless services officer?" the mayor
demanded. "And this is in the 'meanest city in the nation,'" said
Emily Reilly, the vice mayor.</TE>
<TE>   But there are also stringent anti-camping, loitering and
panhandling laws that even some civic boosters admit are harsh. One
law bans sitting within 10 feet of a business entrance. It used to be
50 feet. Those are the kinds of things that led the National
Coalition for the Homeless and the National Law Center on
Homelessness and Poverty to rank Santa Cruz the seventh-most punitive
city in the country in dealing with homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a mean town. There are some mean laws," said
Paul Brindel of the Community Action Board of Santa Cruz County, a
social service advocacy group. "It's kind of a schizophrenic
relationship we have with people in or near poverty."</TE>
<TE>   That's because even though the city government has long been known
for its progressive policies, the people the officials represent are
increasingly concerned about property values. Partly because of its
closeness to the high-tech corridor in San Jose, and partly because
the city is 97% built out, Santa Cruz has become the least affordable
housing market in the nation. The median price of a home is $420,000,
while the median income is $65,000. Only about 6% of the populace can
afford a house.</TE>
<TE>   Even employed people can have difficulty staying housed. According
to Brindel, 35% of the homeless are working, 10% full time. "You
can't even get a broom closet for less than $500 a month," said Mad
Mike, who has a tent down by the San Lorenzo River. "Plus, they won't
rent to you unless you're single, gay, politically correct and
vegetarian. I got kicked out of one place for cooking sausages."</TE>
<TE>   His roommates ran out of the house at the odor of cooking meat,
then held a house meeting and voted him out.</TE>
<TE>   The politics of homelessness in Santa Cruz date to the '60s, when
the hippies arrived, attracted by the beauty and the easy lifestyle
of what was then a blue-collar retirement town.</TE>
<TE>   Other waves of itinerants came in the '80s and '90s. The city
estimates there are now 3,500 homeless in Santa Cruz County, of which
maybe half are in the city. Only half of them can be accommodated in
shelters and transitional housing.</TE>
<TE>   After decades of dealing with them, long-timers can identify the
various homeless subcultures by name, from travelers like Free Bird
(young people bumming around the country on dad's credit card) to the
vehicularly housed (those sleeping in cars) to houseless (which is
sort of like homeless) to the slightly pejorative term for the rest
of us (the housed).</TE>
<TE>   Homeless Had a Tent City</TE>
<TE>   The relationship over the years between the housed and the
un-housed has been characterized by spasmodic periods of
openheartedness, followed by conflict. In 1992, homeless protesters
blocked intersections to demand better treatment. In 1995, a tent
city was established while the City Council benignly looked the other
way.</TE>
<TE>   But after reports of rampant drug dealing and overflowing sewage,
it was shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the homeless are more or less institutionalized as a
permanent part of the daytime landscape. To see how
institutionalized, all you have to do is visit their office on River
Street.</TE>
<TE>   There, Larry Templeton, the charismatic, self-appointed captain of
one band of homeless people, sits at a desk in front of butcher-paper
sheets on the wall outlining the volunteer work they're doing as part
of an effort to show the community that the homeless are not wasted
strands of DNA. The list of chores includes cleaning up the Costco
parking lot. "Adopt a Highway" is listed, but Templeton, whose
nickname Jumping Jack was earned as a Toughman brawler in the '80s,
isn't sure they'll get a sign on the freeway. "The competition we
have is the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Templeton, who looks a little like Buffalo Bill in cowboy dress
and flowing mustache, is best known around town for operating the
latest homeless encampment along the river, Camp Paradise. It was so
well run that they had electricity, operated a bike repair business
and built a koi pond.</TE>
<TE>   No issue demonstrates the ambivalence this city has about its
homeless population better than the saga of Camp Paradise. It was
illegal from the start a year ago, but the city didn't find out about
it until it had been in existence three months. After that, the city
ordered the campers to leave. They didn't. The city threatened to
tear down the camp. It didn't.</TE>
<TE>   That's how things stayed until the winter rains accomplished what
the city could not bring itself to do. It washed the camp away. That
night, Mayor Krohn went to the swelling river and helped evacuate
campers.</TE>
<TE>   "What is it about us not being compassionate?" Krohn asked.</TE>
<TE>   The homeless got their office as part of a deal to keep them from
rebuilding Camp Paradise. But one day last week, Templeton, who broke
a man's jaw in seven places during a bar fight before he gave up
drinking, was thinking of going back on his word because local
officials failed to show for a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to lay down for them again," he thundered. He
declared himself ready to gather up his friend Dirt Clod, whose
Indian-style vest and headband made him look like an even
harder-living Willie Nelson, and head back to the river.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Cole, the city liaison to the homeless, was surprised to learn
Templeton was angry. "I've always returned Larry's phone calls," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A city official diligently returning phone calls from a homeless
man, even one as impressive as Templeton, may seem strange, but
that's Santa Cruz. On the other hand, the city can't bring itself to
roll out the red carpet, which troubles Brindel.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it wrong to have a sleeping ban if there are not enough
shelters?" he asked. "The community action network believes it is."</TE>
<TE>   He understands the council's hesitancy to take such a
controversial step as allowing camping in the city. "We get beaten up
by the housed people who are afraid hordes of homeless will come in,"
said Brindel.</TE>
<TE>   Krohn would like to put the issue on the ballot to let the voters
decide.. "We're tired of having to deal with this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Developers say there are solutions. Over a period of decades the
city laboriously bought up land on its outskirts to create a
permanent greenbelt. Now hemmed in and built out, some say the city
should allow building in the greenbelt.</TE>
<TE>   But few want that. "People worked so hard, nobody wants to spoil
it," said Brindel. "We've created the most beautiful place in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Many cities would take the label of being among the meanest to
homeless as a badge of honor. "I'm sure there are cities saying,
'Rats, we wanted to be No. 1,'" said Reilly, who can quote obscure
municipal codes and Pee-wee Herman with equal felicity.</TE>
<TE>   Hearts and Minds in Conflict</TE>
<TE>   Not here. Here, they remain ambivalent, lodged between compassion
for the unfortunate and distaste for the repugnant.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a citizen called the mayor to complain about an
ordinance being considered by the council that would make changes to
the sleeping ban. It would allow up to two weeks of camping in
designated parks while the campers worked on the parks.</TE>
<TE>   "She said she doesn't want any ordinance allowing sleeping," Krohn
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Then she said, 'And what is it about us not being
compassionate?'"</TE>

<HD>State Pulls Back Funds for 300 Local Projects</HD>
<DH>Finances: Millions allocated but unspent on legislators'
pet causes, or 'pork,' will instead help offset budget shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Los Angeles and other California communities are set to lose millions
of dollars set aside but unspent for parks and community
improvements, a casualty of the state's $12.5-billion budget
shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Lawmakers agreed with Gov. Gray Davis' plan to take back the
money, allocated by the state over the last three years, as part of
more than $2 billion in budget cuts and adjustments that Davis signed
into law Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of the park money has left some critics wondering why
city and county officials did not spend it. In one example, Los
Angeles will lose nearly $1 million that was to have been spent
improving Ernest E. Debs Regional Park in Montecito Heights.</LD>
<TE>   "City officials have just sort of dropped the ball on this one,"
said Louis Quirarte, chairman of the Friends of Debs Park, a
community group.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and the Legislature are returning to the general fund $42.2
million earmarked for local parks during the 1999 and 2000 budget
years and $30 million more that the state approved last year for
museums, community centers and dozens of other projects.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles stands to take some of the biggest hits. The county
will lose nearly $5 million set aside to beautify Tujunga Wash. The
city will lose more than $3 million for a variety of park projects.</TE>
<TE>   Local governments and community groups typically have as long as
three years to apply for funding after it has been budgeted by the
state. Many agencies apply quickly for the money, however, knowing
that an economic downturn might materialize at any time and the state
might take the funds back.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, would-be recipients either failed to apply for the
funds now being rescinded or their completed applications were
frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Kolb, director of development and marketing for the Los
Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, said the city was slowed
by lengthy environmental reviews and has limited staff to handle such
matters. That was the case, she said, for the $985,000 the city will
lose for planning and restoration of Ken Malloy Harbor Regional Park.
Money allocated in the state's 1999-2000 budget for the regional park
and two other projects is now set to be returned to the general fund.</TE>
<TE>   ''We had three years, and frankly we didn't feel the sense of
emergency,'' Kolb said. ''The economy was booming, we had a lot of
projects in place, and we planned to add these.''</TE>
<TE>   The state is also set to take back $985,000 earmarked for Debs
Park, triggering criticism from advocates who want to turn the land
into a nature preserve.</TE>
<TE>   "They probably put this on the back burner and just let it go
hang,'' Quirarte said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County, meanwhile, will probably scale back plans--at
least temporarily--to beautify the Tujunga Wash area in the San
Fernando Valley without the $5 million in state funding, said Rod
Kubomoto of the county Department of Public Works.</TE>
<TE>   The county is trying to spruce up the area by adding landscaping,
a footpath and a bikeway, and by creating a stream.</TE>
<TE>   ''The beauty of this project is that you are taking an urban
concrete jungle scenario and trying to beautify it,'' Kubomoto said.
''But to draw money from the state, you have to have all your permits
and approvals. You need a resolution approved by the county Board of
Supervisors and environmental reviews.''</TE>
<TE>   In all, funding for more than 300 projects around the state is at
stake, including a skateboard park in San Bernardino, a multicultural
health center in Long Beach, a library in La Canada Flintridge and
playground safety projects in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Such local projects championed by individual legislators to
benefit their home districts or a pet cause are known around the
Capitol as pork. Lawmakers covet these budgetary morsels for evidence
of their effectiveness in the Legislature, particularly during
election years like this one. Consequently, some are quietly fuming
that funding for projects in their districts is being dashed.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, lawmakers approved Davis' reduction plan last week in
a bipartisan vote, which the governor described Saturday as both
"remarkable and historic."</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the difficult policy choices we must make in
addressing budget shortfalls," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The $103-billion spending plan Davis signed in July included $65.5
million for requests by individual legislators, finance officials
said. About half the amount has not been spent, and Davis wants it
returned to the general fund to help balance the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Such projects constitute a small portion of the budget but can
make a big difference on the local level.</TE>
<TE>   In Sherman Oaks, for example, homeowners characterize $50,000 to
plant trees along Ventura Boulevard as crucial to their community.</TE>
<TE>   ''Fifty thousand dollars out of a $103-billion budget is nothing,
but to Sherman Oaks, it's important,'' said Richard Close, president
of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. ''To our community, this a major
project.''</TE>
<TE>   City officials in El Cajon, near San Diego, say they were caught
off guard by news that $147,000 the state had allocated for a skate
park in their community during the 1999-2000 fiscal year is in
jeopardy. The city has paid a landscape architect $30,000 and awarded
a contract for the project, which is also receiving money from the
city and county.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's hugely disappointing to have received a correspondence from
the state that you have received the money" and then have Sacramento
''pull that all away once you've committed the dollars,'' said Lori
Beliveau, director of recreation for El Cajon.</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody is finding fault with the state for targeting pork
projects, however.</TE>
<TE>   Tax watchdogs frown on the practice of using state funds to pay
for lawmakers' pet causes as opposed to issues of statewide concern,
such as building highways and funding schools.</TE>
<TE>   ''These pork projects are really sort of outside the rational
budget process,'' said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn. ''It's like a king throwing out pennies to the
peasants.... It's more of a luck of the draw, or who's quicker or
more powerful, as opposed to where the money is needed.''</TE>

<HD>Film Director Had Cocaine in His System, Coroner Says</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Ted Demme had cocaine in his system when he had a heart
attack and died last month after playing a celebrity basketball game
in Santa Monica, coroner's officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The "small amount" of the drug may have contributed to the heart
attack, said Los Angeles County Coroner's Lt. David Smith. The
original autopsy proved inconclusive, but further tests showed the
presence of cocaine. Demme, 37, also suffered from buildup in his
arteries, Smith said.</LD>
<LD>   Demme collapsed during the basketball game Jan. 13 and was taken
to Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center in full cardiac arrest. He was
pronounced dead 20 minutes later.</LD>
<TE>   Nephew of director Jonathan Demme, he directed the movies "Blow"
and "Beautiful Girls," among other productions.</TE>
<TE>   "Blow," which starred Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz, told the
story of George Jung, who became Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's
right-hand man in the United States during the 1970s.</TE>

<HD>Stampede to Get Into Summer Camp Gets Underway With
Pasadena Fair</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No sooner have parents recovered from the Christmas holidays than
it's time to lunge into the next winter rush: summer camp sign-ups.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, it's the middle of winter. But a full-blown frenzy to book up
June, July and August with education, adventure and athletics
unfolded Saturday at Westridge School in Pasadena as nearly 5,000
parents and children attended a convention-like summer camp fair.</LD>
<LD>   "If you are not here and on top of things with your boxing gloves
on, you can't get into the camps you want," said Sharon Vassar, 45,
of Pasadena as she charted her 11- and 14-year-old daughters' summer.</LD>
<TE>   Working parents scoured the booths for summer camps with
after-hours care. Determined parents want a summer of academic
enrichment--more algebra, more science, more essays. Competitive
parents want their children to be well prepared to take the ERBs, the
ISEEs, the SATS, all acronyms for standardized tests for private
school and college admissions.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like if you don't start planning early, you will be left
behind," said Andrew Wong, 45, of San Marino, who thinks his son may
be interested in a science camp this year. "You know that come
January, it's time to start thinking about summer."</TE>
<TE>   Then Wong stopped and chuckled, realizing he sounded a bit
ridiculous. "It's sad, but we parents are all preconditioned."</TE>
<TE>   Most kids just want to have fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I go to drama camp?" one girl asked her mother.</TE>
<TE>   The Westridge Summer Opportunities Fair, in its 10th year, has
grown from a community service attended by hundreds to a regional
attraction drawing thousands, mainly from the San Gabriel Valley
area, but also from as far away as Santa Clarita and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 summer camp vendors attended from throughout the
country, promoting programs from the exotic (sail the Caribbean, make
a motion picture in New York) to the strictly academic (study
calculus at Stanford University or chemistry at Polytechnic School)
to the traditional.</TE>
<TE>   "We actually sit around a campfire and roast marshmallows," the
representative from Gold Arrow Camp in the Sierra National Forest
told one mother.</TE>
<TE>   The fair is viewed as the kickoff event of the season, with other
smaller fairs taking place throughout California until mid-March.
Most are sponsored by the American Camping Assn., which accredits
U.S. summer camps.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in attendance over the years and the fierce competition
to get into many camps reflect several family trends, camp directors
and child care experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, 9 million to 10 million children nationally attend some
kind of summer program. In the 1970s--when there were fewer women
working--the numbers were 6 million to 7 million.</TE>
<TE>   For some working parents the summer months present a vexing child
care problem. As early as January, they have to start piecing
together a string of summer school courses, outdoor camps and
vacations to fill the 12 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   While many camps begin accepting applications in January, most
deadlines come in February and March.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so hard to know everything months in advance," Vassar said,
explaining that she was recently laid off and does not know what
turns her life will take between now and June.</TE>
<TE>   For other parents, the summer presents another opportunity to
build resumes. Especially popular are university summer school
programs for high school students.</TE>
<TE>   A Stanford University Summer College representative said the
program gets more than 700 applicants for its 350 slots and has
turned to an admissions process based on essays and test scores.</TE>
<TE>   But even younger children find themselves enveloped in summer
academics.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Marks, director of Get Smart Tutoring Center, fills her
classes with dozens of second and third graders "whose parents want
their children to be on top of it."</TE>
<TE>   "They want to make sure their kid is climbing the ladder the
fastest," Marks said, adding that mathematics is among the most
popular summer courses.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mean to sound cynical about it, but that's what I see ...
structured time around concrete goals."</TE>
<TE>   Psychiatrist Sees Too Much Pressure</TE>
<TE>   These are the kinds of things that worry Heather Krell, a child
psychiatrist and director of outpatient clinics at UCLA Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "All the pressure, getting into the right summer camp, the right
school, the right classes--parents out here in L.A. are far too
concerned about status," she said. "How much pressure are we going to
put on a 6-year-old?"</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Krell said, summer should be a time to take a break
from the school and achievement. The exception, she said, is the
older youth who wants an academic experience.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the proliferation of camps are baby boomer parents with
the cash to pay for the programs, which can run into the hundreds if
not thousands of dollars for the highest-end travel camps.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Lindgren of San Marino said she is going to encourage her
high-school-age son to attend the three-week Costa Rica Summer Travel
Program, in addition to soccer camp and scouting camp.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be good for him to travel out of the country, meet
people of a different culture, learn some Spanish--a broadening
experience," Lindgren said.</TE>
<TE>   And sure, she said, he can "be a little bit of a couch potato on
weekends, in between games."</TE>
<TE>   Day camps that offer after-hours care tend to be the most in
demand and the hardest to get into.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Sawyer Camps, based in Arroyo Seco, uses a tiered application
process, adheres to strict deadlines and time-stamps incoming mail,
practices that are not uncommon.</TE>
<TE>   Returning campers get first priority. Newcomers had better drop
everything and fill out the application the second it arrives.</TE>
<TE>   That's just what Terry Hodgson said she did one January morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I got it in the mail right in the middle of my daughter's
birthday party," she said. "I left the party and ran over there to
drop it off."</TE>
<TE>   That was six years ago, but a family anecdote well remembered.
Even now, she said, as a returning parent she still makes sure her
application arrives in early January.</TE>
<TE>   One popular outdoors camp, Summerkids in Altadena, doesn't even
have a listed phone number and fills to overflowing simply on
word-of-mouth referrals.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't want to be answering the phone saying, 'No, I'm
sorry. No, I'm sorry,'" said Maria DiMassa, who owns and runs the
camp with her husband, Joe.</TE>
<TE>   DiMassa tells parents to relax. They don't need to rush to her
home to drop off applications. "We will do our best to work together
to get you in," she tells them.</TE>
<TE>   And the same words of calm come from the American Camping Assn.
The frenzy, they say, is mainly among affluent parents worried that
they will be shut out of their first-choice camp.</TE>
<TE>   Camps are run by many agencies, such as the YMCA, scouting
organizations and parks and recreation departments.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a wide range of camps available for every income," said
March Driscoll of the camping association.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing can match the influence of word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a call from a friend this morning who told us we needed to
get down here and find something this month," said Paul Wennberg, 39,
the father of a 6-year-old girl who is new to the summer camp
phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife stopped lounging around their Pasadena house,
drove to Westridge and started planning summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess there are just too many kids and not enough spaces," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Some Turn Up Noses at New Luxury Hotel</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neighbors of Burbank's first upscale extended-stay hotel have a
vision: an onslaught of out-of-town, cocktail-swilling studio egos
invading their shady patch of town.</LD>
<LD>   Despite its marble baths, 300-thread-count sheets and down duvets,
some residents believe the hotel will mean plunging property values,
clogged traffic and drunken guests staggering through the streets of
mid-century duplexes, pastel apartment complexes and shotgun houses
in the heart of Burbank's media district.</LD>
<LD>   And it doesn't help, they say, that Burbank officials ignored
their concerns and even lied about plans for The Graciela Burbank,
expected to open next month with room prices ranging from $170 to
$500 a night.</LD>
<TE>   "The studio people would probably be happier on the Westside" than
in a hotel boasting views of a tired strip mall with a 24-hour Vons
grocery store and sounds of honking horns and skidding tires from the
nearby Ventura Freeway, said Don Elsmore, a 40-year Burbank resident.
"There's no need for the frills."</TE>
<TE>   But city boosters say they're confident that residents will change
their minds once the 101-room hotel opens.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not Beverly Hills," said Susan Bowers, executive director
of the Burbank Chamber of Commerce, "but doesn't Burbank deserve to
have nice hotels?"</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the 33,000-square-foot site at 322 N. Pass Ave. was
slated for a Homestead Studio Suites Hotel, a nationwide chain
offering moderate short-term housing. Neighbors were fine with the
project after city officials assured them that the hotel would have
no bar or restaurant serving alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Pass Avenue Associates, an investor group, acquired the
property for more than $2 million, with plans to build a luxury hotel
that would serve alcohol and cater to Warner Bros., Disney,
Universal, NBC, ABC, DreamWorks SKG, Nickelodeon and other studios
clustered in the San Fernando Valley. Beverly Hills-based Belvedere
Hotels and Resorts is to manage the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors feel betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   They question why the city allowed The Graciela Burbank to forge
ahead without holding hearings so the public could respond to the new
project.</TE>
<TE>   Although city officials said no laws were broken in the process,
they admitted making mistakes, and mostly blamed staff who have since
retired.</TE>
<TE>   City Manager Bud Ovrom issued a two-page apology to the City
Council and sent an e-mail to his staff acknowledging that "we looked
like a bunch of idiots [at best--liars at worst]."</TE>
<TE>   Few neighbors disagreed with that assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "The city sold us out to please the studios, as if we're a bunch
of bumpkins," said Lori McCaffrey, a 13-year resident who said the
hotel will bring traffic and debauchery and reduce property values.</TE>
<TE>   McCaffrey scoffed at the idea of top entertainment executives
reveling in the hotel's luxury features, such as a garden rooftop
(overlooking the red lights of cars crawling on the freeway) and
afternoon high tea. "What studio executive is going to have high
tea?" she said. "Well, maybe if it's Long Island tea....</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the Beverly Wilshire," she said. "This isn't Beverly
Hills; this is Burbank. This isn't Rodeo Drive; it's Pass Avenue. Who
is going to want to stay here?"</TE>
<TE>   Studio executives, who city officials say supported the project,
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Graciela Burbank promised to be good neighbors. "We sort of
understand why they're upset," said Margit Haut, the hotel's director

in Burbank."</TE>
<TE>   Many neighbors care only that it will serve alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way to predict activity at the bar," said Suzanne
Benoit, a congregant at Burbank Church of Religious Science, across
the street from the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The church hosts Alcoholics Anonymous meetings five days a week
and has had problems with a bar in the strip mall, where drunks have
wobbled into the parking lot and urinated in flower beds.</TE>

<HD>Justice Prevails for State's First Female Attorney</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles' female lawyers are likely to feel a special satisfaction
Friday when U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first
woman on the nation's highest court, officially renames the downtown
Criminal Courts Building after California's first female attorney.</LD>
<LD>   The christening of Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center
is a testament to the tenacity of the woman who is credited with
multiple firsts in the profession and who paved the way for the
thousands of women who followed her.</LD>
<LD>   Foltz was the first woman admitted to the state's first law
school, the first woman to practice law in California, the first
female notary public in the state, the first woman to serve as deputy
district attorney in Los Angeles County, the founder of the public
defender system in the United States and a determined suffragist.</LD>
<TE>   Clara Shortridge was 15 when she eloped with Iowa farmer Jeremiah
Foltz in 1865. Seven years later, she had given birth to three of her
five children when her husband, desperate for work, pulled up stakes
and set out for Portland, Ore., where he found a clerk's job at
starvation wages.</TE>
<TE>   She had to start a dressmaking business to make ends meet. But
when the local sheriff took her sewing machine to pay her husband's
debts, and no attorney would argue her case, her desperation turned
into the anger that would lead her first to the women's suffrage
movement and later into law.</TE>
<TE>   She was pregnant with her fifth child when she and her family
moved in 1875 to San Jose, where her husband sold real estate. But he
soon abandoned her and the children, taking with him what little
money they had to spend on train fare to Oregon to see another woman.
She divorced him.</TE>
<TE>   As the sole breadwinner, she began earning speaking fees,
lecturing on suffrage.</TE>
<TE>   "Did God fail in his last crowning work when he made woman, that
she is not the equal of man? Genius, talent, hard labor know no sex,"
she said in her standard speech.</TE>
<TE>   Her orator's gifts and passion for the limelight only whetted her
appetite for learning.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to earn a better living, one that would also help her
in her struggle for women's rights, she began reading lawbooks. She
found that the only prerequisites to joining the state bar were that
an applicant be a 21-year-old white male citizen of good moral
character and possess the necessary "learning and ability."</TE>
<TE>   Because her ability was as great as her ambition, she took action.
She and suffragist Laura deForce Gordon, the publisher of a small
newspaper in Northern California, drafted the "Woman Lawyer's Bill,"
substituting "person" for "white male" in the state code provision.
Though women were not allowed to vote, the two found an influential
politician to get their measure before the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   When her bill came to a vote in 1878, Foltz made the trip to
Sacramento in the caboose of a cattle train, her pockets empty except
for hard biscuits and boiled eggs she had brought with her.</TE>
<TE>   "The bill met with a storm of opposition such as had never been
witnessed upon the floor of a California Senate," she wrote in her
autobiography. "Narrow-gauge statesmen grew as red as turkey gobblers
mouthing their ignorance against the bill, and staid old grangers who
had never seen the inside of a courthouse seemed to have been given
the gift of tongues and then delivered themselves of maiden speeches
eloquent with nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents said they feared that a female lawyer's "seductive and
persuasive arts" would sway juries. When they were lawyers, women
would next demand to become jurors and even judges. Others painted a
picture of a female lawyer blushing and stammering when she had to
cross-examine a witness on a sexual matter.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1878, with the help of Assemblyman Grove L. Johnson, the
father of future progressive Gov. Hiram Johnson, the bill passed by
two votes. But if Gov. William Irwin did not sign it before midnight
the next day, it was doomed to die.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be deterred, Foltz slipped past two guards, entered Irwin's
office and persuaded him to sign.</TE>
<TE>   Then she hit the lawbooks again and, in a flurry of publicity,
passed a three-hour oral bar exam and became California's first
female lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   After winning several cases involving divorce and larceny, she
realized that she needed formal legal schooling. She and Gordon
enrolled at the University of California's Hastings Law School, to
the jeers and mockery of the young male students.</TE>
<TE>   In class, when Foltz coughed or turned a page or moved her chair,
her classmates did the same. On the third day, the women were told to
leave. They sued.</TE>
<TE>   In court, the school's attorney complimented her on her grace and
beauty but said female lawyers were dangerous to justice because "an
impartial jury would be impossible when a lovely lady pleaded the
case of the criminal."</TE>
<TE>   Broader education, he argued, "would make a woman less womanly"
and thus "destroy our homes." He contended that a feminine presence
might be distracting to "serious male students."</TE>
<TE>   Foltz, arguing her own case, demanded that the school stick to
arguing the law and not "woman's sphere." She noted the absurdity of
allowing women to practice law but not to study it.</TE>
<TE>   "The knowledge of the law of our land will make women better
mothers, better wives and better citizens," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge agreed, and the school appealed. As Foltz prepared her
appellate argument, she kept practicing law and lecturing. In
December 1879, the high court ruled in her favor.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time the law school doors finally opened, Gordon had
gone to law school elsewhere, and Foltz was too busy with her
practice. (Curiously, for several decades, Hastings Law School has
celebrated Clara Shortridge Foltz Day, but it wasn't until 1991 that
the school posthumously awarded her a law degree.)</TE>
<TE>   California's 1879 constitutional convention cemented her victories
by enacting unprecedented clauses ensuring women equal access to
employment and education.</TE>
<TE>   In one of her first cases, Foltz represented a penniless young
Englishwoman whose husband had deserted her on a visit to San Jose.
When the woman became ill, her doctor seized her baggage to pay his
bill. Foltz won the case and recovered the belongings. Then, in open
court, she scolded the doctor and the lawman who had confiscated the
luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Another time she won a suit against a restaurant that had refused
to seat unescorted women. And when an opposing attorney suggested in
court that she should be home raising her children, she quipped, "A
woman had better be in almost any business than raising such men as
you."</TE>
<TE>   For two years, in the 1880s, she put out a short-lived daily
newspaper, the San Diego Bee, then opened law offices in New York and
later in Denver, where she specialized in mining law.</TE>
<TE>   In 1906, she moved to Los Angeles, where she practiced law in the
face of sneering insults from male colleagues. Her wit served her
well: When an opposing attorney contemptuously referred to her
throughout a trial as "a lady lawyer," Foltz answered that she could
not return the compliment, for she "never heard anybody call him any
kind of lawyer at all." Her client, an immigrant accused of arson,
was acquitted. The jury didn't even leave the box to deliberate.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as sometimes happens to this day, reporters paid more
attention to what Foltz wore and how she dressed her hair than how
she presented her case.</TE>
<TE>   In a new enthusiasm, she demanded penal reform and spearheaded the
segregation of juvenile and adult prisoners. She helped to improve
the state parole system. In 1911, when she was 61, she was appointed
Los Angeles' first deputy district attorney, a job she held for more
than two years. She also led a movement that authorized appointments
of paid public defenders in 30 states.</TE>
<TE>   She once described the practice of law as "hard, unpoetic,
relentless." But she never gave up.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents and siblings joined her in California, and in 1921 her
brother, Samuel, was elected a U.S. senator. Nine years later, at 81,
without even telling him, she entered the Republican primary for
governor on a women's rights ticket. She got 8,000 votes and lost.</TE>
<TE>   Before her death in 1934, she wrote of her career and children: "I
have lost more for myself than I have gained for all women. All the
pleasure of my young motherhood I sacrificed for woman's cause."</TE>
<TE>   Foltz wanted her fame to endure and hoped that "an inquisitive
biographer" would use her scrapbooks and papers to put her name "over
the top." But the only one of her children to survive her had other
ideas: She sold her mother's furniture and destroyed her papers.</TE>

concluded it was a homicide after further investigation and arrested
the boy later on Friday, said Sgt. Michael Garrahan. He declined to
elaborate or suggest a motive.</LD>
<LD>   Nicholas Calamusa, 15, died at the home of the 14-year-old after
the rifle the two boys were playing with went off. The rifle belonged
to the suspect's parents, police said.</LD>

<LD>Is it really necessary to have an All-Star game in All-Star week?</LD>
<LD>   The activities at the NHL FANtasy exposed more kids to hockey, the
SuperSkills competition on Friday showcased the talents of the
league's best players.</LD>
<LD>   Then came the game itself.</LD>
<TE>   If this were an audition, the NHL wouldn't get a callback.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL wanted to increase interest in the sport in the Southland
and figured an injection of star power could help. But the All-Star
game at Staples Center on Saturday didn't accomplish all its
objectives.</TE>
<TE>   Forget about a showcase for the world's fastest game. At times it
looked as if the players were going through the motions--as in
slow-motion replays.</TE>
<TE>   And there's an unwritten rule that you don't hit anybody in
All-Star games. Taking the checking out of hockey is like taking the
teeth from a tiger. Aside from one good blow delivered by Jeremy
Roenick, Saturday's game, an 8-5 victory for the World team against
the North Americans, had all the edge of a crossing guard leading
students across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran All-Star attendees said Los Angeles never generated the
buzz they've seen take over other cities when the NHL comes to town.
I've seen more local media turn out for a Laker-Clipper game.</TE>
<TE>   From the sound of things, the crowd at Staples Center consisted of
the same loyal group that usually shows up at King games. They
cheered for King representatives Ziggy Palffy and Jaroslav Modry.
They booed self-exiled King Rob Blake of the Colorado Avalanche. They
roared when the video screen showed Bob Miller, the voice of the
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   As for the rest of L.A.--somehow I don't get the feeling the
masses turned down a lovely winter day to sit in front of the
television for this one.</TE>
<TE>   So think of it as a reward to the dedicated hockey fans. For
instance, this was the first time Mario Lemieux played in Los Angeles
since he retired after the 1997-98 season. He even scored a goal.
That's the equivalent of the Mona Lisa coming to the local art
museum.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing about this game was it featured a healthy dose of
Teemu Selanne. He's everything I like about hockey. Exciting player,
good guy. And if you pay attention to him, you'll find out what's
wrong with hockey, too.</TE>
<TE>   First, the good. Selanne scored two goals in the first period. He
also had two breakaways and one other clean shot in the game.
Whenever he has the puck and a scoring chance, your heart starts
pounding a little harder.</TE>
<TE>   When he played for the Mighty Ducks he provided hope for hockey in
the Southland because he fit in so well. If a guy from Finland could
come here and be so comfortable, maybe the sport could blend in also.</TE>
<TE>   "I like warm weather and I like the situation that you can go
pretty much anywhere and people didn't recognize you," Selanne said.
"I'm a big fan of California."</TE>
<TE>   He's still in California, only now he plays up north after the
Mighty Ducks traded him to the San Jose Sharks last season. Now Paul
Kariya is the only star left in Anaheim, and all the team has to show
for the Selanne trade are Steve Shields and Jeff Friesen--a backup
goalie and (at the moment) third-line winger. And the franchise is
floundering at the turnstiles.</TE>
<TE>   Bad stuff for a franchise that used to represent the league's
growth potential. Then there was the overall tone of these comments
from Selanne on Saturday:</TE>
<TE>   "All in all in the NHL, I don't think the hockey is as much fun as
it used to be," Selanne said. "But [the] All-Star game is always fun.
Everybody has [a] good attitude here. They are so happy here."</TE>
<TE>   Anywhere around Selanne is usually the Happiest Place on Earth.
When he starts saying the league is losing its fun quotient, that's
worth noting.</TE>
<TE>   "The game has changed," Selanne said. "They used to have more fun,
more fun in the practice. The game is tougher, the traveling ... and
when you have done it a long time, it's hard to really get excited
sometimes. That's why I respect those guys who have been in the
league such a long time and night after night they find a way to get
excited and get the job done."</TE>
<TE>   For a goal-scorer like Selanne, the problems include:</TE>
<TE>   "More defense. More physical," he said. "We were just talking
about it, the guys. We were still trying to enjoy the game, but it's
not the same [as] it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   You get the feeling there would be faster progress if Commissioner
Gary Bettman would publicly acknowledge the league has its problems.</TE>
<TE>   The television ratings are still infomercial-low, but all he cares
about is that they're up 36%.</TE>
<TE>   Bettman hears only what he wants to hear, which is the positive.
It's like a movie studio that plucks the one line of praise from a
bad review and quotes it in an advertisement.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Lemieux said: "I think we should try to create a little
bit more offense, excitement. But I think we've come a long way in
the last couple years.</TE>
<TE>   "Having said that, I think we still have a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   When those comments were relayed to Bettman, he highlighted that
Lemieux said: "We've come a long way."</TE>
<TE>   The NHL gets another chance for positive exposure during the
upcoming Olympics. Instead of simply trying to avoid injury, the
players will be actively pursuing a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   "That game out there [the All-Star game] is not really a game,"
Selanne said. "It's nothing compared with what the Olympics will be."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday in Los Angeles wasn't a hockey feast. It felt more like
an appetizer for Salt Lake City.</TE>

<HD>Russian Novelty</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Bowman livens dull game by playing five countrymen
with Zhitnik of the Ukraine. They spark 8-5 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leave it to Scotty Bowman to put some excitement into one of the
dullest NHL All-Star games in years.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly 55 minutes, Bowman watched his World All-Stars play a
passionless game against Pat Quinn's North American team Saturday
afternoon before he decided to make a change.</LD>
<LD>   Bowman got into the Olympic spirit and played his five Russian
players together with Alexei Zhitnik of the Ukraine. They sparked the
World team to a come-from-behind 8-5 victory before a sellout Staples
Center crowd of 18,118.</LD>
<TE>   Sergei Fedorov, who plays for Bowman's Detroit Red Wings, tied the
score, 5-5, with a goal 16:59 into the third period and Alexei
Zhamnov, who plays for Chicago, added an insurance goal with 48
seconds remaining for the World All-Stars, who won for the second
time in five years since the NHL switched to its current format in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I told [World team assistant and Chicago Coach] Brian [Sutter],
that if it gets down to five minutes to go and if the game is playing
the same, let's do it," Bowman said. "I knew Sergei could play the
wing and Brian said he could put Alex [Zhamnov] on the other wing
with [New York Islander] Alexei [Yashin] at center. We had the two
defensemen [Washington's Sergei Gonchar and Zhitnik] together the
whole game, and [with Tampa Bay's Nikolai Khabibulin] at goalie, we
had somewhat of a Russian six."</TE>
<TE>   The key to the World team's comeback was the play of Khabibulin,
who could have been selected the game's most valuable player after
becoming the fourth goaltender in All-Star history to record a
scoreless period with 20 saves in the third. Instead, North America's
Eric Daze of Chicago, who had two goals and one assist, won MVP
honors.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to last season's 14-12 game, scoring was almost
nonexistent. There were 89 shots on goal, but the puck found the net
only 13 times, twice with empty nets.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good that it wasn't that much of a high-scoring game,"
said Mighty Duck winger Paul Kariya, who played for the North
American team. "At least there was some defense played."</TE>
<TE>   North America Coach Pat Quinn, also coach of Team Canada, tested a
possible Olympic line combination by teaming Kariya, Pittsburgh's
Mario Lemieux and Colorado's Joe Sakic.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya was pleased with the result, which included a textbook
two-man break that led to Lemieux's only goal of the game in the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some pretty good chemistry ... but our timing was a little
off on the finish end of it," Kariya said. "We joked around a little
during the game, but we'll see how it turns out."</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux moved into a tie with Wayne Gretzky for most All-Star
goals with 13.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's game got off to a sluggish start. With 11 players
making their All-Star debuts, play was even more subdued than in most
All-Star games. Even after San Jose's Vincent Damphousse scored the
game's opening goal for North America 35 seconds into the first
period, there wasn't too much skating done from either team.</TE>
<TE>   That was until Philadelphia's Jeremy Roenick, who played for the
North American team, blasted Zhitnik with a shoulder check against
the corner wall. Roenick's hit put some life into the game and the
North American team responded with its second goal moments later.</TE>
<TE>   Damphousse was again in the middle of the action, making a clever
cross-ice pass to a streaking Ed Jovanovski, who beat Detroit
goaltender Dominik Hasek to give North America a 2-0 lead 10:06 into
the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's Patrick Roy appeared headed for a first-period shutout
for North America following a couple of nice stops on Yashin, but San
Jose's Teemu Selanne ended the World team's scoreless drought 13:10
into the period when he picked up a loose puck and slid it between
Roy's legs to cut North America's lead to 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   After Daze scored on a sweet backhand to give North America a 3-1
edge, Selanne scored his second goal of the game, thanks to a
creative assist from Carolina's Sami Kapanen, to send the World team
into the first intermission down, 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   North America regained its two-goal lead early in the second
period when Lemieux and Kariya teamed for their goal against
Edmonton's Tommy Salo. Vancouver's Markus Naslund ripped a shot past
Montreal's Jose Theodore to cut North America's lead to 4-3 at 5:26.</TE>
<TE>   With a 5-3 lead after two periods, the North American team fell
apart once the World All-Stars turned up the pressure. Former Duck
Espen Knutsen brought the World team within a goal with a score 7:52
into the period before the Russian unit took over.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun to play with my Russian buddies," Fedorov said. "It
was an interesting experience because we play the same style of play,
which is with the puck and cycling. It feels good to play a way we
haven't played in a long time. I know that I gain lots of confidence
when I play that way."</TE>

<LD>Freelance writer Norman Chad, commenting on some Super Bowl
personalties: "You've got Tom Brady, who's a cross between Kurt
Warner and Forrest Gump. You've got Drew Bledsoe, who's a cross
between Earl Morrall and Lazarus. And you've got Bill Belichick,
who's a cross between Bill Parcells and a footstool.</LD>
<LD>   "Boy, oh boy, how did the Patriots go 5-11 in 2000, begin 0-2 in
2001 and make it to Super Sunday under Belichick? Could I have been
more wrong about this guy? I never thought Belichick could take a
team to a Super Bowl; heck, I never even thought Belichick could take
the trash to a receptacle."</LD>

Belichick is like listening to telephone wires hum."</TE>

Giant quarterback, remembered Dick "Night Train" Lane mostly for his
daring. "He was so dangerous to throw at," Tittle was quoted in the
San Francisco Chronicle on the Hall of Fame cornerback, who died
Tuesday at 73.</TE>
<TE>   "He could be beaten because he gambled so much, but then he'd pick
off a flat pass and go all the way.... He was a great football
player, a very rough, tough guy."</TE>

<TE>   Tracking Tiger: Jim Armstrong in the Denver Post: "Fox Sports
president and executive producer Ed Goren, when asked what kind of

Broadway can make a hit play about Eva Peron, it can do the same with
Jesse Ventura. The Minnesota governor and ex-wrestler is helping to

<DH>Pro basketball: After big wins at Dallas and San Antonio,
L.A. takes step backward in 101-94 loss to Atlanta and falls to 2-2
on trip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Well, this one sealed the deal. The Clippers are unquestionably
performing a halting version of the NBA playoff shuffle, taking one
step backward, two steps forward and one step backward during the
first four games of their season-high seven-game trip.</LD>
<LD>   Cha-cha-cha-cha.</LD>
<LD>   That adds up to two victories and two losses after the Clippers
dropped a 101-94 decision Saturday into the laps of the more
aggressive and efficient Atlanta Hawks in front of a crowd of 14,994
at Philips Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Next stop, Boston, where the Clippers face the Celtics today, less
than 24 hours after squandering a 13-point third-quarter lead against
the Hawks and a chance for their first three-game winning streak on
the road in almost a year.</TE>
<TE>   How the Clippers will play against the suddenly reeling Celtics is
anyone's guess.</TE>
<TE>   So far on this trip, the Clippers have beaten up on the Dallas
Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs, two of the league's elite teams, but
have fallen to the Hawks and the Memphis Grizzlies, two of its weaker
clubs.</TE>
<TE>   All things considered, a 2-2 record isn't surprising. Coach Alvin
Gentry wasn't impressed with a split of the team's first four games,
however. He knows the Clippers let games they could have won slip
away. He knows that with greater energy and execution, they could be
an unthinkable 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   "They just outplayed us," Gentry said of the Hawks, who ended a
six-game losing streak, "and that was the difference in the game.
It's typical of our team. We take two steps forward and one back.
Until we play with consistency we're going to go through games like
this for the rest of the season."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers could have moved two games above the .500 mark with a
victory against the Hawks. Instead, they returned to it with a 24-24
record.</TE>
<TE>   And to think, they appeared to be in control after taking a 63-50
lead on Elton Brand's layup midway through the third quarter. The
Hawks, playing one night after losing to Michael Jordan and the
Wizards at Washington, had accomplished little.</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, the game turned in Atlanta's favor and the Clippers
could not respond. The Hawks closed the quarter by outscoring the
Clippers, 23-6, turning a 13-point deficit into a 73-69 lead to start
the fourth. Three-point baskets from DerMarr Johnson and Jason Terry
to start the final period extended the Hawks' run to 29-6, and the
Clippers were all but finished.</TE>
<TE>   Terry led the Hawks with 30 points, making four of six three-point
attempts, and Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 27.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski scored 22 points for the Clippers, but had only
seven after halftime. Brand had 19 points and 11 rebounds and Michael
Olowokandi had 18 points and 14 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to find a way to stop doing this," Piatkowski
said. "We're beating the tough teams. It's the games we should be
winning that we're losing. Once we get up on a team, we've got to
crush them."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had few problems with the Hawks at the start. They
executed their half-court plays flawlessly, scoring from inside and
outside. They ran when fastbreaks were available. They played
suffocating defense.</TE>
<TE>   And by halftime, the Clippers led, 51-42.</TE>
<TE>   They simply couldn't sustain their momentum beyond the midway
point of the third quarter. The Hawks roared to life, making five of
six three-point tries in the third, and took the game from the
Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't win if we don't play with a lot of passion and at a high
level," Gentry said, echoing comments of earlier this season. "The
Hawks played with more passion and more energy. They made shots.
Obviously, that helps. We didn't react well after they made their
run. Teams are going to make runs when they are at home."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas on Tuesday and San Antonio on Thursday made strong
fourth-quarter runs at the Clippers. The difference was that the
Clippers had the lead against the Mavericks and Spurs and never
surrendered it.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Hawks, the Clippers played from behind in the fourth
quarter. Several times, they seemed poised to rally, but they never
drew closer than five points--at 96-91 with 1:56 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked [after the game] about how losing this game takes away
from what we did in Texas," Gentry said. "This could have been the
start of a great road trip, but we didn't get it done tonight."</TE>

<LD>Elton Brand limped through the Clippers' loss Saturday against the
Atlanta Hawks, but still reached his averages by scoring 19 points
and taking 11 rebounds in 42 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Later, Brand said a bruised left hip could keep him from playing
today at Boston. He suffered the injury earlier in the season and
aggravated it diving for a loose ball in Thursday's victory over the
San Antonio Spurs.</LD>

<LD>Rick Smith was forced to resign as Georgia Tech's defensive
coordinator after a committee concluded he misrepresented himself in
his media guide profile.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, hired last month by new Coach Chan Gailey, admitted Monday
he never played on the football and baseball teams at Florida State,
as his profile said.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't want to bring anyone in ... where they don't have a
wide base of support from the faculty, the students and the alumni,"
said Bill Wepfer, associate chairman of the School of Mechanical
Engineering, on Saturday. "There's a sense that we are in a new era
where everything has to be perfect.</LD>
<TE>   "So there was a lot of concern from people in the Georgia Tech
community that felt we needed to rise to this new level."</TE>
<TE>   Smith had served as assistant head coach, recruiting coordinator
and defensive backs coach at Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm unemployed," he said. "I don't have a job at Kentucky. I
don't have a job at Georgia Tech. I'm basically ruined."</TE>

<HD>Steady Does It for Malone, Jazz</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karl Malone was as steady as ever. And Rasheed Wallace was an
emotional disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Malone had 24 points and 13 rebounds and reserve Scott Padgett
added 11 points as the Utah Jazz defeated the Portland Trail Blazers,
97-96, Saturday afternoon at Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   John Stockton had 17 points and nine assists, and scored on a
layup with 36.5 seconds to play to help end Portland's five-game
winning streak.</LD>
<TE>   The Jazz won the season series with Portland, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year when the season's over, we look back on two or three
games separating us from a particular playoff spot," Malone said.
"We've got the tiebreaker [against Portland]."</TE>
<TE>   It was Utah's final home game until Feb. 28. The Jazz goes on a
franchise-record nine-game trip while the Delta Center stages figure
skating and short-track speedskating during the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Bryon Russell made two free throws with 9.3 seconds to play,
giving the Jazz a 97-93 lead. Those two shots proved key moments
later when Scottie Pippen made his fourth three-point basket of the
fourth quarter. He finished with 17 points. Bonzi Wells led Portland
with 24 points.</TE>
<TE>   The game included a meltdown by Wallace, Portland's temperamental
forward, who was ejected in the third quarter after yelling in the
face of referee Hue Hollins, arguing that he had been fouled. Wallace
led the league with 41 technical fouls last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 86, Milwaukee 81--Allen Iverson scored 25 points and
the 76ers rallied at Milwaukee in a rematch of last season's Eastern
Conference finals won by Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, listed as probable before the game because of flulike
symptoms, played 47 minutes, but made only nine of 30 shots. Ray
Allen led the Bucks with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Coach George Karl blasted his team--especially Allen,
Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll keep showing them film, we'll keep showing them
opportunities," Karl said. "But if they were to continue to refuse to
change, there's probably going to have to be a change. That means
trading one of them or firing me. I think it's come to that, to be
honest with you.</TE>
<TE>   "Every night it's a little bit of stubbornness, a little bit of
too much dribbling, a little bit of not committing to the team, a
little bit of not having pride in how to play the game the right
way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 97, Seattle 91--A.J. Guyton scored 13 of his 15 points in
the fourth quarter and the Bulls overcame a 13-point deficit to post
a rare road victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls ended a 26-game road losing streak against Western
Conference teams, dating to a victory over the Clippers on Feb. 6,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls won for only the second time in 23 road games. The
SuperSonics, who got 23 points from Vin Baker and 21 from Gary
Payton, lost their third in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 98, Toronto 91--Jason Kidd had 31 points, 10 assists
and 10 rebounds for New Jersey at East Rutherford, N.J., his second
consecutive triple-double.</TE>
<TE>   No team has defeated New Jersey twice in a row this season. The
Nets won for the seventh time in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Carter had 26 points for Toronto, which had a three-game
winning streak ended.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 115, Cleveland 107--Jerry Stackhouse scored 23 points--18
in the second half--and the Pistons made a season-best 42 free throws
for their fourth consecutive road victory.</TE>
<TE>   Utah had the previous high for successful free throws with 39 on
Nov. 23.</TE>
<TE>   New York center Marcus Camby will be out three to six weeks
because of a torn muscle and bruised right hip suffered in a
collision with Jermaine O'Neal in the first quarter of New York's
92-87 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Friday.</TE>

<LD>A student who collapsed and died while trying out for the Northern
Illinois football team had an enlarged heart, the coroner of DeKalb
County, Ill., said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Results of the autopsy on Jawan Jackson, 19, were inconclusive,
but he "had a very enlarged heart for his size" and it appears he
died of natural causes, coroner Dennis Miller said.</LD>
<LD>   Miller said microscopic studies of Jackson's heart muscle will be
conducted, and could take up to two weeks.</LD>
<TE>   He said there was no obvious cause of death.</TE>

collapsing during conditioning drills.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic trainers tried to resuscitate him before calling
paramedics, the school said.</TE>

<HD>She Kept Her Dream Alive</HD>
<DH>After Overcoming Injury, 17-Year-Old Cohen Is Now
Considered a Solid Medal Contender</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even at her lowest point, when the pain of a fractured vertebra drove
her to withdraw from last year's U.S. figure skating championships,
Sasha Cohen refused to consider that she might join the long list of
skaters forced out of the sport by stress-induced injuries.</LD>
<LD>   "I never thought I couldn't come back," she said. "I knew it would
be hard, but I always persevered, even when I was frustrated, and I
worked really hard."</LD>
<LD>   Said her mother, Galina: "She's a strong-willed person. She knows
what she wants, and those are good things. At the end of the day,
she's happy with her decisions. And she also knows if there are
consequences of her decisions, and that's a good thing to learn, that
our actions have consequences."</LD>
<TE>   The story of this 17-year-old from Laguna Niguel, though, is as
much a triumph of the won't as a triumph of the will.</TE>
<TE>   She won't be intimidated, no matter that she looks as delicate as
a porcelain figurine. And she won't blindly follow convention, having
become something of a rebel.</TE>
<TE>   After returning from her injury and reestablishing herself on the
international scene, Cohen blew the doors off the U.S. championships
last month at Staples Center with two electrifying performances that
placed her second to six-time U.S. champion Michelle Kwan. Thus, she
will go to the Salt Lake City Winter Games knowing a medal is within
her reach.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of me kind of expected and hoped to go, to get one of the
spots on the team," she said. "But when I stop and think that I'm
actually going to the Olympics, it's really amazing.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember watching Kristi Yamaguchi win the gold [in 1992] and I
watched that tape over and over. I remember Oksana [Baiul] winning
[in 1994] and more recently, I remember Tara [Lipinski, in 1998]. As
I get older, each lady was more and more inspiring. With Tara, just
the way that she won--and nobody expected her to--is a real
inspiration for me in Salt Lake. I thought she had an amazing
performance, and I hope I have one like that at Salt Lake."</TE>
<TE>   At Nagano, Lipinski defeated Kwan because of her girlish
exuberance and technically demanding triple-triple combination jumps.
Cohen's style is more balletic, featuring lithe layback spins and
steady spirals. Her musicality infuses sweetness into the
choreography she and her coach, John Nicks, devised for her
"Sentimental Waltz" short program and breathes life into the old
standby "Carmen" in her long program.</TE>
<TE>   Nicks is fond of saying her innate grace won't allow her to assume
an ugly position on the ice. But she also has a fiery determination
about where she wants to go and doing what it takes to get there.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very ambitious and fearless and breathtakingly beautiful,"
said Peggy Fleming, the 1968 Olympic gold medalist and a skating
icon. "The way she can move is amazing."</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt, though, that she moves to her own beat.</TE>
<TE>   Although women have largely given up on performing triple axels,
Cohen has tried a quadruple salchow, defying skeptics who predicted
she'd re-injure her back in an effort to become the first woman to
land a four-rotation jump in competition. After three misses during
the season, she omitted the jump at the U.S. nationals but announced
she will try it at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I've got my orders," Nicks said, sighing in mock
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Galina Cohen, who was born in Ukraine and emigrated to San Diego
with her family at 16, supported her daughter's initiative. But they
also took precautions when she began practicing the quad, buying a
special harness that spared her harm.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not foolhardy. People don't realize that. She's a pretty
smart girl," said Galina. "People have to realize all these girls are
determined. Michelle is, Sarah Hughes is, Angela Nikodinov is, Jenny
Kirk is. That's what makes them who they are. If you're not
determined, you will go only so far, especially in this sport.... You
have to have an inner strength and core to stay up there."</TE>
<TE>   That strength was tested after the U.S. nationals, when some
observers accused Cohen of skating too close to competitors while
warming up for the long program and not yielding when they landed
jumps, as skating etiquette demands. Cohen and Kwan brushed arms, but
Kwan also narrowly missed Hughes. Yet, it was Cohen who was portrayed
as a Roller Derby rogue. "In the whole six minutes, we were close
once," Cohen said, denying she shadowed Kwan or tried to intimidate
anyone. "A whole bunch of other skaters had close calls as well.... I
know that I was fine and just going to get my stuff in. It's just
something people chose to talk about, and hopefully it will die down.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm focused on is my on-the-ice stuff. The stuff in the
media doesn't bother me that much."</TE>
<TE>   However, it disturbed her mother. Message boards on skating Web
sites crackled with expletives about Cohen and demands that she be
thrown off the Olympic team, an extreme reaction to an incident Kwan
downplayed. In fact, Galina Cohen said her daughter was cut by a
careless competitor in a practice collision four years ago at
now-closed Ice Chalet in Costa Mesa, but she wouldn't identify the
girl.</TE>
<TE>   "The other competitor landed a jump and cut her right calf in
half, for 21 stitches, 11 inside and 10 outside," Galina Cohen said.
"The other skater never admitted her fault. Fine. We never insisted
on it. We would never think of blaming anybody. But at the time, you
never know if you're going to skate away. It was her landing leg....</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Nicks has told me if you haven't done much, you won't be in
the news and nobody is going to care about what you do. Attention
means you've done well. You'd like to have positive attention, but
what can you say?"</TE>
<TE>   Nicks stood by his student, saying she practiced her jumps as
she's trained to do.</TE>
<TE>   Although the spirited teen and the 72-year-old Englishman
sometimes resemble a comedy team, with running gags about her
willfulness and his inability to rein her in, much of that is for
show. Their collaboration, he mused, is unlike any he has had in a
career that has taken him to the Olympics twice as a pairs skater--he
finished eighth with his sister Jennifer in 1948 and fourth in
1952--and soon 10 times as a coach.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is conflict and the psychology of training," he said.
"When you train a young person, you want them to become as
independent as possible. It's the independent person who's the strong
competitor, the kind of competitor that needs nobody. Then you turn
around and say, 'Please do as I say.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fine line. It's not easy. Knowing that, I'm perhaps more
tolerant than I might have been 20 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's talents also extend his tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a unique, special persona that she has," he said. "It's not
just her technical skating. It's a lot of other things."</TE>
<TE>   He's not alone in that belief.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Sasha Cohen is just as capable of going in [to the
Olympics] and winning as anyone, depending on other people's
performances," said Sandra Bezic, a choreographer who has worked with
Yamaguchi, Lipinski and 1988 men's gold medalist Brian Boitano.</TE>
<TE>   "She's fantastic, and I thought her choreography in both her
programs [at the U.S. nationals] was perfect for her at her stage of
development. It was all just excellent, excellent work. When she's on
and she does that, she's everything you want a skater to be. She's
captivating, she's beautiful and she has that 'it' quality. She's
gorgeous, talented and spirited."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's performances at the U.S. nationals put her in contention
for an Olympic medal. Kwan must be considered the favorite over a
recently shaky Irina Slutskaya of Russia, and U.S. third-place
finisher Sarah Hughes, who won medals at all three of her Grand Prix
events this season, to only one for Cohen in two Grand Prix events.</TE>
<TE>   "I, as a coach, expect all those ladies to be coming to Salt Lake
well-prepared and skating well," Nicks said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cohen: "I go in with a dream of winning Olympic gold, and I'm
thinking more of something I can do for myself, and that's to skate
two clean programs. Doing well at nationals is a really big step for
me, and we'll see what happens now at Salt Lake."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Appreciates the Power of Gold</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Americans brush aside Costa Rica, 2-0, and win
their first Gold Cup championship in 11 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An 11-year drought ended Saturday afternoon for the United States
national soccer team when it defeated Costa Rica, 2-0, at the Rose
Bowl to win the sixth Gold Cup.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a long time in between [titles]," said backup goalkeeper
Tony Meola, the only starter from the victorious 1991 team still on
the squad.</LD>
<LD>   "This team has the same heart that we had in '91. We deserved to
win. We got progressively better every single game."</LD>
<TE>   A fine goal by Josh Wolff after an excellent run during which he
held off the challenge of defender Luis Marin put the U.S. ahead in
the 37th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the second half, defender Jeff Agoos secured it
with a superbly taken free kick that flew over the Costa Rican
defensive wall and beyond the reach of goalkeeper Erick Lonnis.</TE>
<TE>   The two-goal margin underlined the superiority of the American
team on an afternoon when many--but certainly not all--fans in the
crowd of 14,432 favored Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team took control from the opening whistle and did not
allow its opponent time to settle. It was faster to the ball, more
enthusiastic in the tackle and far more creative--and therefore
dangerous--on offense.</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Kasey Keller earned his fourth shutout in five Gold Cup
matches, all of which were won by the U.S. The only time he was even
remotely troubled was in the 70th minute when Wilmer Lopez fired a
shot that Keller dived to his right to punch away for a corner kick.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end, Lonnis was kept much busier. The U.S. went ahead
when defender Frankie Hejduk found Wolff with a pass and the forward
gathered speed with each stride as he headed for the goal, finally
cutting the ball back beyond the reach of the advancing Lonnis and
into the far corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, it got to my left foot and I was able to slot it
with the left foot," said Wolff, whose goal was his first since
scoring against Costa Rica in a World Cup qualifying game in Kansas
City, Mo., last April.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming back from an injury, you've always got to keep your head
up and try to stay positive. So I was pretty happy to be able to
contribute."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. almost doubled its advantage in the final minute of the
first half when only an alert foot save by Lonnis denied Landon
Donovan a goal.</TE>
<TE>   The shot came after an excellent buildup that involved Brian
McBride--the tournament's most valuable player and top goal
scorer--and Wolff.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica raised the level of its play slightly in the second
half, but the game moved out of reach when Donovan was fouled by
defender Reynaldo Parks and Agoos stepped up to take the resulting
free kick from about 24 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "As I was lining up [to take the kick], I saw the goalkeeper move
toward the middle of the goal and the far post was open," Agoos said.
"It was just a nice shot from there and it went well for me."</TE>
<TE>   It had been more than six years since Agoos' previous goal, which
came against Guatemala on Jan. 21, 1996, at the Coliseum in the
third-place game of the 1996 Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   In a World Cup year, winning the championship of the North and
Central American and Caribbean [CONCACAF] region is especially
meaningful.</TE>
<TE>   "Championships are very rare," said Wolff, "so we're all going to
be very happy with this. Every player in the tournament made a case
for himself to be on the [World Cup] team, and we're excited just to
get a championship."</TE>
<TE>   Cobi Jones, who wore the captain's armband while appearing in his
U.S.-record 150th game for the national team, said the victory was
deserved.</TE>
<TE>   "We went all out and we pretty much dominated and did what we
needed to do, we scored the goals," he said. "It's a great feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Cup victory might indeed be an omen of sorts for the U.S.
When the Americans won the tournament under then-coach Bora
Milutinovic 11 years ago, they went on to reach the second round of
the 1994 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   This team has shown that such a feat is not beyond its ability
this summer in Japan and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In the third-place game, Canada defeated South Korea, 2-1.</TE>

<HD>Bruin Minds Set on Easy Victory</HD>
<DH>College basketball: UCLA bounces back and efficiently takes
care of Oregon State, 70-48.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORVALLIS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>UCLA guard Billy Knight called Gill Coliseum "a barn house," saying
this rural town is so boring that getting up for Oregon State would
be a chore. Coach Steve Lavin didn't exude a sense of urgency either,
sitting in the media room until five minutes before tip-off watching
Arizona and Stanford play on TV.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins might have thought they were at the end of the earth,
and certainly more interesting Pacific 10 Conference developments
were occurring elsewhere. But a second loss on this trip would have
been as ominous a warning as Punxsatawney Phil seeing his shadow.</LD>
<LD>   So once the game began, the Bruins put spring in their step,
breezing to a 70-48 victory in front of 9,039 to stay two games
behind Oregon, the surprising conference leader that routed UCLA by
29 points two nights earlier and held off USC on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "Our veterans understood this was a must win," Lavin said. "Older
players know that it's one thing to lose, that all teams lose, but
the important thing is not to lose the lesson."</TE>
<TE>   Judging from this effort, lessons included playing better defense
close to the basket and working diligently for high-percentage shots.
The Bruins (15-6, 7-4 in the Pac 10) held Oregon State (10-11, 3-8)
to 35.3% shooting while making 61.5% of their own shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We turned down shots to get better ones and we made them take
poor shots from outside," said forward Matt Barnes, who shook off a
sore neck to make four of six shots and take two charges.</TE>
<TE>   The barn house became Barnes' house early in the second half when
he made nifty moves inside for two baskets that increased a
nine-point halftime lead to 38-26, then made a three-point shot from
the top of the key to make it 49-36.</TE>
<TE>   After experiencing neck spasms reaching for the telephone from his
hotel bed Friday morning, Barnes spent two days getting treatment
from Bruin trainer Mark Schoen and a local physical therapist.</TE>
<TE>   "When it first happened I couldn't move, I was really scared," he
said. "But it loosened up with all the therapy."</TE>
<TE>   Center Dan Gadzuric was another key, exploiting a significant
height advantage to score 18 points while staying out of foul
trouble. He also dominated on defense, stepping out near the top of
the key and helping force the Beavers to launch a school-record 32
three-point shots. They made only seven.</TE>
<TE>   Every UCLA starter played well. Jason Kapono made all seven of his
two-point shots and scored 19 points. Knight scored 11, and freshman
point guard Cedric Bozeman turned in his best performance with a
career-high eight assists and one turnover.</TE>
<TE>   They were even better on defense, with Knight making three steals,
Kapono getting two and the Beavers settling for long and contested
looks at the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "They packed it in on defense, took away [power forward] Philip
Ricci and dared us to beat them from outside," Beaver Coach Ritchie
McKay said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins usually didn't shoot until the shot clock was under 10
seconds and they made 14 of 25 while trying only four three-pointers.
They were even better in the second half, making 18 of 27 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids played with great poise," Lavin said. "But it doesn't
get any easier. There is more parity in the conference this year than
I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to tell whether the Bruins will make like
groundhogs and return to their den for more napping or use this
victory to launch a winning streak--as they did a year ago by
rattling off eight in a row after losing to California by 29.</TE>
<TE>   But for one night they quieted the doubters. The next challenge
will be to beat the top teams in the conference--UCLA is 0-4 against
USC, Arizona, Stanford and Oregon, with another game against each
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   First up will be the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see next week if we can keep up the same mind-set," Barnes
said.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Run Into Dead End</HD>
<DH>College basketball: USC lets lead in game and conference
get away at the finish against Oregon, 73-69.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>There's a cemetery across the street from Oregon's vaunted McArthur
Court, which is fitting, because USC was buried beneath a late
avalanche of Duck runs and big plays Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The 23rd-ranked Trojans twice held six-point leads and seemed as
if they might put the game away. But Oregon, behind some streaky
three-point shooting, closed out the Trojans with a 73-69 victory to
take a one-game lead in the Pacific 10 Conference race in front of a
rowdy sellout crowd of 9,087.</LD>
<LD>   USC (16-5 overall, 8-3 in the Pac-10) had a 63-57 lead after two
Sam Clancy free throws with 5:54 to play. Oregon, though, ended the
game by outscoring the Trojans, 16-6, a run that included three
three-pointers and a back-breaking three-point play to give the Ducks
a 71-69 lead with 38.8 seconds to play.</LD>
<TE>   Oregon (17-5, 9-2 and 13-0 at home) came into the game averaging a
league-best 88.9 points in conference games and making a league-best
42.6% of their three-point attempts. The Ducks made only nine of 28
three-pointers and four of 17 in the second half, but they came at
the right time.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what they do," USC Coach Henry Bibby said. "They go on
runs and speed the game up. They're first in the Pac-10 in shooting
the three-pointer and they made them when they had to."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, who finished with a game-high 25 points and 11 rebounds
for his seventh consecutive double-double and 13th of the year, had
converted two free throws with 55.5 seconds to play to give USC a
69-68 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But on Oregon's next trip down the court, Duck forward Luke
Jackson beat Clancy off the dribble in the lane. USC guard Desmon
Farmer tried to spin around to help out but twisted his left ankle on
the play and fell to the side as Clancy was called for a foul on
Jackson just before his runner went in.</TE>
<TE>   "I got beat on the play and I'll take full responsibility for it,"
Clancy said. "He leaned into me and got the foul."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson made the free throw to complete the three-point play with
38.8 seconds remaining, giving the Ducks a 71-69 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than go down low to Clancy, USC drew up a game-winning
three-point attempt for Brandon Granville on the left wing.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks closed in on Granville, though, and the USC senior point
guard, who had already made three three-pointers in the game and had
scored 17 points, passed to David Bluthenthal at the top of the key.
Bluthenthal, who had an open look, unleashed a 25-footer that bounced
off the rim and into the waiting arms of Oregon guard Frederick
Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal, who shot two for 11 from the field on the day,
including 0 for 3 from beyond the three-point strip, left the arena
without commenting.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby said Bluthenthal was the Trojans' second option on the play.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going for the win," Bibby said. "What have you got to
lose, besides the game? It went exactly the way we planned it. You
win if you score. It was a game-winning shot, but it didn't go in."</TE>
<TE>   USC shot 39.3% from the field and made four of nine
three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' other six-point advantage came on a Granville score
with 5:03 remaining in the first half, giving the Trojans a 34-28
lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks then embarked on an 11-1 run over the next three minutes
to gain a 39-35 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Our inner spirit is tested in games like these," Oregon Coach
Ernie Kent said of his team, which was led by sophomore guard Luke
Ridnour's 15 points. "We needed to keep calm and we did. The ability
to keep their composure will help them not only at Oregon but also
wherever they go after the game is over and in their everyday lives.</TE>
<TE>   "These games teach us and help us grow as a team."</TE>
<TE>   Granville was less philosophical.</TE>
<TE>   "They just made some shots," he said. "They made some shots when
they had to and that's the difference. It wasn't an Xs and O's thing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough one, but we've got to live with it. We're only
one game down."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because we lost at Oregon doesn't mean our season's over,"
he said. "We still have them at home."</TE>

<HD>Black Pride Parade Is Sunny for 2,500</HD>
<DH>Events: Marking February as history month, it's Santa Ana's
rainbow-hued event.</DH>

<LD>Thousands of onlookers lined the sun-swept streets of downtown Santa
Ana on Saturday for the city's Black History Month parade, a
celebration of diversity that's become one of Orange County's most
popular festivals.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great day. We have a mix of cultures here in Santa Ana. We
can celebrate not just for Martin Luther King, but for everybody,"
said Kenny Murray, 40, a postal employee from Anaheim. "Look at the
crowd. We have Asians, blacks, whites, Hispanics. We've come
together."</LD>
<LD>   There were black gospel singers, several marching bands--and
Orange County's top Latino elected official, Rep. Loretta Sanchez,
prancing along Civic Center Drive and slapping hands.</LD>
<TE>   The parade, which drew an estimated 2,500 people, was a family
affair. Children sat on fathers' shoulders and delighted at the
sights and sounds of an event dating back more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   James Gaither, who moved to Orange County in 1958 and later joined
the county's Human Relations Commission, said the climate for blacks
has changed in the county, where they are just 2% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "Things like this help," he said. "See all these different
nationalities? It's beautiful. After Sept. 11, we need all of this
you can get."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone in the crowd was thrilled. As a motorcade of the
county's predominantly white elected officials went by, Myisha
Saulsberry Singletary complained, "It's Black History Month, where's
the black people? If you're in L.A. County, the parades are
different."</TE>
<TE>   She and her father still appeared to be having a good time,
inching out onto Civic Center Drive for a look at the approaching
floats and marching bands.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beautiful, but it's different than it was a few years ago,"
Wendal Singletary said. "It's more all-American."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward was a cultural fair, with black history exhibits and
food from several cultures.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice. The sun's out. People are in a good mood," said Rick
Russell of Santa Ana. "There's not much more you can ask for."</TE>

<HD>Knutsen Says He's a Lucky Ex-Duck</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster;Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Columbus Blue Jacket center Espen Knutsen had just scored a goal and
assisted on another for the World team in the NHL All-Star game
Saturday at Staples Center. And the one thing he wasn't going to do
was go to Disneyland.</LD>
<LD>   Been there. Done with that.</LD>
<LD>   Knutsen, who played 19 games for the Mighty Ducks in 1996-97, was
a late addition to the World team, replacing injured Jere Lehtinen of
Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   Knutsen became the first Norwegian to play in the All-Star game.
He got a point when he fed Markus Naslund for a second-period goal
and scored when he swatted a rebound between the legs of goalie Sean
Burke in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in the history books now," Knutsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it becomes part of the curriculum in Oslo schools is to be
seen. But this was certainly a mountaintop moment for Knutsen.</TE>
<TE>   History was what his NHL career seemed to be after the 1996-97
season. He returned home and signed with Djugardens of the Swedish
League, the team with which he gained notoriety. It was the end of a
bad experience.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had acquired his rights from the then-Hartford Whalers
in 1996 and he stood out during training camp the following season.
Then he scored three goals in 19 games, fell out of favor with Coach
Pierre Page and was shipped to minor-league Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a really tough year," Knutsen said. "When the coach
gives you confidence and plays you a lot, you play better. It's tough
to do anything when you just play seven or eight minutes a game.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I would get back to the NHL. I was done. I was
going to be a good Norwegian player in the Swedish League."</TE>
<TE>   That changed when the Ducks traded his rights to the expansion
Blue Jackets after the 1999-2000 season. Knutsen had 11 goals and 53
points for Columbus last season. He has eight goals and 31 points
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good see Espen back in the NHL," said San Jose's Teemu
Selanne, another former Duck. "I don't think the Ducks gave him an
even chance to play and show what kind of player he can be. That's
why I'm very happy that he's back and in a game like this. This is a
great experience for him too."</TE>
<TE>   The All-Star game is a notorious nonhitting affair.</TE>
<TE>   But the play that brought one of the loudest cheers was in the
first period, when Philadelphia's Jeremy Roenick slammed Buffalo's
Alexei Zhitnik into the boards.</TE>
<TE>   All-Star games have been free skates. In fact, there has been only
one penalty in the last four games, and that was when Sandis Ozolinsh
was called for hooking in the 2000 game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little bit surprised," Zhitnik said. "Sometimes you have
to do something crazy, something unusual. After the game, when we
were shaking hands, he said, 'Sorry.'</TE>
<TE>   "This game is fun to play. But hockey is a physical sport. When
the physical portion of the game is taken away, it's a whole
different game. Nobody wants to get hurt, with the Olympic Games
coming up and everybody trying to make the playoffs. But the physical
part of the game is what makes it hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Selanne, however, was happy that Detroit defenseman Chris Chelios
didn't share those feelings. Chelios had Selanne lined up along the
boards in the first period, but merely nudged him. Selanne went up
ice and scored the first of his two goals.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the softest he has ever hit me," Selanne said. "There
are so many great players here and you don't have to worry about that
if you keep your head down someone is going to knock you out."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Members of the 1980 Olympic hockey team, in town for their first
reunion since their triumph at Lake Placid, received a standing
ovation when they took a lap around Staples Center before Saturday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   Even Mark Pavelich, who didn't skate in the "game" against a
collection of NHL alumni Friday, joined his teammates to wave at the
crowd and clap for the All-Stars as they skated onto the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Ramsey said he took advantage of the reunion to collect some
Olympic memorabilia. He said he had no souvenirs from his Lake Placid
experience, having given away the single stick he brought home from
the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we're all taking sticks or jerseys and getting them
autographed now," he said.</TE>

<LD>Washington (12-8, 7-4) at UCLA (6-14, 3-9), 11, Fox Sports Net, KACD
(850), KEWS (1350)--The Bruins ended their latest skid (five games)
by beating Washington State on Friday. Freshman guard Brianna Winn
gave another glimpse of her intriguing potential with a career-high
13 points, and UCLA also got a career-best 13 points from freshman
center Sissy Pickett. While the Bruins are striving for some
end-of-the-year respectability, the Huskies have another agenda.
Washington is among the seven Pac-10 teams fighting for the 2-6
seedings in the conference tournament. It is also a homecoming
weekend for former Orange County high school star Giuliana Mendiola,
who equaled her career high (22 points) in Friday's victory over USC.</LD>

<TE>   Washington State (2-19, 0-11) at USC (11-10, 7-5), 2 p.m.--Both
teams are coming off defeats, 16 in a row for Washington State after
a 79-55 loss to UCLA on Thursday. The Cougars got 14 points from
Francine McCurtain in that game, but usually are led by Brittney
Hawks, who is ninth in the Pac-10 in scoring (13.8) and second in
rebounding (9.8). The Trojans led Washington at halftime Thursday but
fell, 69-63. Aisha Hollans averages 17.8 points, third-best in the
conference.</TE>

<HD>Kansas State Clawing Its Way Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once among the elite of college basketball, Kansas State has
retreated to virtual obscurity since Lon Kruger's departure as coach
in 1990.</LD>
<LD>   The Wildcats have not been nationally ranked or had a winning
conference record since. They have also made the NCAA tournament only
twice after reaching the Big Dance in each of Kruger's four
seasons--and 16 times (with 15 appearances in the round of 16) under
such legendary coaches as Jack Gardner, Tex Winter and Jack Hartman.</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, Kansas State--at 9-10 overall and 3-5 in the Big
12 this season--wouldn't seem to be emerging from its doldrums of the
1990s and 2000s.</LD>
<TE>   But Saturday's 70-61 victory over No. 9 Oklahoma State at
Manhattan, Kan., may have signaled a change.</TE>
<TE>   The victory followed a 71-70 upset of Texas Wednesday and was the
first over a top-10 team since a 68-64 stunner over No. 1 Kansas at
Lawrence on Jan. 17, 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Kansas, the No. 2 Jayhawks are next for the Wildcats,
who have lost 18 in a row to their state rival at Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody thought it would be a tough stretch for us," said
Kansas State forward Matt Siebrandt, who had 15 points against
Oklahoma State (17-5, 4-5). "We've come out and played. We've got one
more, and it's the toughest one yet. Hopefully, we'll have the same
fire and energy for Kansas."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State never trailed in defeating Oklahoma State for the
first time since the inception of the Big 12 in 1996-97. The Wildcats
were ahead, 36-21, at halftime and had their lead go below double
figures only twice in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we had to keep the lead in double digits," Siebrandt
said. "If they got it under that, they'd be within striking distance.
We couldn't let that happen."</TE>
<TE>   Most responsible for keeping Oklahoma State out of striking
distance was Larry Reid, a senior point guard known mostly for his
scoring ability until recently. Reid had seven assists and three
steals to go with 18 points and eight-for-13 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "We've needed Larry to do more things," said Coach Jim Wooldridge,
whose arrival at Kansas State last season coincided with that of
Reid, a transfer from Northern Oklahoma Junior College. "We've needed
him to get other guys more shots, play better defense and get our
guys organized defensively, and be more of a leader out on the floor.
All these things he's doing better right now."</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Duke 98, Clemson 88--Jason Williams scored 28 points and the
Blue Devils (20-1, 8-1 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) had 11
three-point baskets at Clemson, S.C., in their 13th consecutive
victory over the Tigers (11-11, 2-7).</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Kansas 100, Colorado 73--Drew Gooden had 20 points and 11
rebounds--his 17th double-double of the season--at Lawrence, Kan., as
the Jayhawks (19-2, 8-0 in the Big 12) defeated the Buffaloes (12-7,
3-5) for the 26th consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Marquette 74, No. 4 Cincinnati 60--Dwyane Wade scored 25 points
and Cordell Henry had 20 as the Golden Eagles (19-3, 8-1 in
Conference USA) increased their overall winning streak to eight and
home record to 12-0. Cincinnati (20-2 , 8-1) came in with a 20-game
winning streak, longest in the nation. Marquette held Cincinnati to
35.7% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Florida 76, Mississippi State 48--Matt Bonner had 25 points
and eight rebounds at Gainesville, Fla., as the Gators (16-4, 5-3 in
the Southeastern Conference) ended a losing streak at three.
Mississippi State (17-5, 4-4) scored a season-low 20 points in the
first half.</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Oklahoma 85, Texas 84-- Hollis Price scored 25 points,
including the go-ahead basket in the final seconds of overtime at
Austin, Texas, as the Sooners (17-3, 6-2 in Big 12) defeated the
Longhorns (14-7, 5-3) for the sixth consecutive time. Texas' Brandon
Mouton had 26 points, including a last-second three-point basket that
sent the game into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Alabama 57, Louisiana State--Erwin Dudley had 12 points and
16 rebounds and the Crimson Tide (19-3, 7-1 in the SEC) overcame 36%
shooting to defeat the Tigers (12-9, 2-6) at Baton Rouge, La.</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Kentucky 91, South Carolina 74--The Wildcats (15-5, 5-3 in
the SEC) made 11 of 22 three-point shots at Lexington, Ky., in
defeating the Gamecocks (13-8, 3-5) for the 12th consecutive time.
Kentucky came with the lowest three-point shooting percentage (28%)
in the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Gonzaga 94, Portland 80--Dan Dickau started the game at
Portland, Ore., with back-to-back three-point baskets and finished
with 39 points for the Bulldogs (20-3, 7-1 in the West Coast
Conference). Portland is 5-17 and 1-7.</TE>
<TE>   Rutgers 82, No. 14 Syracuse 74--Jerome Coleman scored 22 of his 27
points in the second half at Piscataway, N.J., as the Scarlet Knights
(14-7, 5-4 in the Big East) posted consecutive wins over ranked teams
for the first time in school history. Rutgers beat No. 17
Connecticut, 61-53, Wednesday night. Syracuse (17-6, 6-3) has lost
four of five games.</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Miami 68, No. 17 Connecticut 66--Elton Tyler made a
tie-breaking layup with 13 seconds left and 6-foot-1 Michael Simmons
blocked a three-point shot with five seconds remaining at Miami for
the Hurricanes (19-3, 6-3 Big East). Connecticut is 14-5 and 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Georgia 79, Mississippi 72--Steve Thomas scored 16 points
and seven rebounds in his return to the starting lineup for the
Bulldogs (17-5, 6-3) at Athens, Ga. Mississippi (17-5, 6-3) lost for
the first time in five games. Thomas had only 10 points and two
rebounds in two games as a reserve since his reinstatement from a
three-game suspension while the school investigated a rape
allegation.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Texas Tech 69, Iowa State 43--The Red Raiders (16-4, 5-3 in
the Big 12) made 11 of their first 12 shots and led by as many as 28
points at Lubbock, Texas. Kasib Powell had 22 points and eight
rebounds for Texas Tech. Iowa State (9-14, 1-8) shot 24.2%.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Pittsburgh 71, Villanova 59--Julius Page had 18 points for
the Panthers (19-4, 7-3 in the Big East) at Pittsburgh. Villanova is
12-7 and 4-5.</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 Wake Forest 89, Florida State 80--Senior Broderick Hicks
scored a career-high 23 points, including eight in the final 1:17,
for the Demon Deacons (16-6, 6-3 in the ACC) at Tallahassee, Fla.
Wake Forest made 18 of 19 free throws in the second half. Monte
Cummings had 23 points for Florida State (10-10, 3-6).</TE>
<TE>   No. 25 Ohio State 58, Northwestern 57--Zach Williams made the
second of two free throws with 16 seconds left to give the Buckeyes
(17-3, 8-1 in the Big Ten) their first lead since midway through the
first half and account for the decisive point at Columbus, Ohio.
Junior Brent Darby scored a career-high 26 points for Ohio State,
including 11 in a row before Williams' key free throw. Winston Blake
had 25 points for Northwestern (12-8, 3-5) but missed the game's last
two shots. The Wildcats have lost 23 in a row at Columbus.</TE>

<HD>Jones, Hopkins Clear Path</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roy Jones Jr. and Bernard Hopkins moved closer Saturday night to a
possible world title showdown.</LD>
<LD>   Jones knocked out Glen Kelly in the seventh round in front of
8,000 at Miami to retain his World Boxing Council, World Boxing Assn.
and International Boxing Federation titles in the 175-pound division.</LD>
<LD>   Hopkins stopped Carl Daniels in the 10th round in front of a
sellout crowd of 8,243 at Reading, Pa., to retain the undisputed
middleweight championship.</LD>
<TE>   "I want Roy Jones," Hopkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "He better box me or he's going to be a hypocrite."</TE>
<TE>   Jones and Hopkins might face each other yet.They would have to
meet somewhere between 160 pounds and 175 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has demanded more money than Hopkins and Hopkins wants the
money split evenly.</TE>
<TE>   Jones beat Hopkins in 1993 for the then-vacant IBF middleweight
title.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, both fighters easily took care of their business at
hand.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, backed against the ropes in the seventh round, put both
hands behind his back, faked with both his shoulders and unleashed a
lightning-quick right that sent Kelly to the canvas for good.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to explain stuff like that," said Jones, chuckling.
"When you're a born fighter, you're just a born fighter. There's all
kind of stuff I got here that never comes out because I don't ever
hardly need it."</TE>
<TE>   Jones (46-1 with 37 knockouts) stunned Kelly (28-1-1) several
times in the second round. He got to the challenger with a quick
right-left combination to the head, and seconds later buckled Kelly's
knees with a roundhouse right and two quick lefts to the head.</TE>
<TE>   Jones floored Kelly with 2:17 elapsed in the third round with a
left uppercut that snapped back the challenger's head.</TE>
<TE>   He dropped Kelly again in the sixth round with a vicious left to
the body that left Kelly gasping for air. Jones landed two other
crushing body shots in the round.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who seemed to be retreating throughout the fight, said
before the bout that his only chance was to pound Jones and get
inside to neutralize his speed.</TE>
<TE>   But Jones kept his distance and was able to use his speed to
measure his shots.</TE>
<TE>   He connected on 53% of his power shots and Kelly landed 20%.</TE>
<TE>   "He's tricky," Kelly said. "I've got no excuse. He's just too
good."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly was another in a line of average opponents for Jones, who
has rarely been challenged since turning pro after the 1988 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who is half-Australian Aborigine and works full-time as a
garbage collector in Sydney, was fighting for the third time in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   For Hopkins (41-2-1, 30 KOs), it was his 15th consecutive defense
of at least a piece of the middleweight title, breaking the
middleweight record of 14 set by Carlos Monzon.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins was the IBF and WBC champion when he defeated previously
unbeaten Felix Trinidad four months ago to become the undisputed
middleweight champion. He has held at least one title since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins spun Daniels around with a body shot early in the ninth
round that sent him staggering into his corner.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins then landed a flurry of punches, including one behind
Daniels' right ear, to take control of the fight.</TE>
<TE>   He put Daniels away with two rights late in the 10th, and Daniels
told his corner to stop the match before the 11th.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just too strong," Daniels said.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit me behind the ear and it dazed me. I couldn't get it back
together. At the end of the 10th, I was still dazed, I was done."</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins would have won every round on each of the judge's
scorecards, but one judge scored the 10th round a tie.</TE>

<LD>This was one mulligan Jay Overton couldn't resist.</LD>
<LD>   Given a reprieve by a rainout a day earlier, Overton shot a
seven-under-par 65 on Saturday to take the first-round lead in the
Senior PGA Tour's Royal Caribbean Classic at Key Biscayne, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Overton was three over on the 18th hole Friday when rain shortened
the tournament to 36 holes. His score didn't count, and he
capitalized with seven birdies Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "We caught a break," said Overton, who said he and playing partner
Dick Mast were "high-fiving" each other when they learned that
Friday's scores would be scrubbed. "This turned out to be a real fun
round."</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen players are within three shots of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Overton, a club pro at Tampa, Fla., qualified for the tournament
Monday. He led by one shot over Mast, Dana Quigley, two-time champion
Bruce Fleischer, Bob Gilder and John Bland.</TE>
<TE>   Overton played in seven tournaments last year as a rookie and
finished 72nd on the money list.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els shot a three-under 69 in the third round of the Heineken
Classic for a 14-under 202 and a four-shot lead at Melbourne,
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's Peter O'Malley, who shot a 70, is in second place.</TE>
<TE>   Els had two bogeys and a few good saves for par in the first eight
holes at Royal Melbourne.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't start out great, but I made the turn quite well," Els
said. "I putted well and played a pretty solid back nine when the
wind started blowing."</TE>

<HD>Mizzen Mast Now Has Strub Series Bookends</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Gray colt wins by four lengths to become the
third horse to complete the Malibu-Strub double.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Historically it's tougher to win only the first and third legs of
Santa Anita's Strub series than it is to sweep the races or only win
the last two. That's because the Malibu, which kicks off the series,
is a seven-furlong sprint and the San Fernando and the Strub Stakes
are around two turns.</LD>
<LD>   Before Saturday, five horses--the last Precisionist in 1985--had
swept the series and 11 had won the San Fernando and the Strub, but
only two had pulled off a Malibu-Strub double. Now there are three,
Mizzen Mast having added to his Malibu victory with a cracking
four-length victory in the Strub in a time of 1:471/5, the fastest
clocking since the race was shortened to 11/8 miles in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Before the Malibu, Mizzen Mast was known as a French import that
only ran on grass. But Frankel, capping a signature year in which he
won 49 stakes, switched him to dirt, and it's on the main track where
the 4-year-old gray colt will stay until further notice. Next up is
the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap on March 2.</LD>
<TE>   For Frankel, there were no prophetic incantations that led him to
trying Mizzen Mast on dirt.</TE>
<TE>   "I just got lucky, that's all," the Hall of Fame trainer said
after saddling his first Strub winner. "I've got a lot of grass
horses in the barn and I took a shot with this horse in the Malibu.
Once in a while it works out. You never know until you try."</TE>
<TE>   Other than the five Strub sweepers, the only other horses to
combine the Malibu with the Strub were Diazo, who won both races in
1993-94, and Determine, the 1954 Kentucky Derby winner, who won the
pair in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel, who also won Saturday's $142,000 Turf Paradise Handicap
with Auction House, another Juddmonte Farms runner, partly hung
Mizzen Mast's Strub victory on the fact that the horse had skipped
the San Fernando.</TE>
<TE>   "That race was run only three weeks ago and it was hard on those
horses," Frankel said. "They ran the first three-quarters of a mile
in something like 1:08 and it took a lot out of them. Where were the
horses that ran 1-2 that day?"</TE>
<TE>   They were Western Pride and Orientate, who were pace factors in
the Strub before fading to seventh and sixth, respectively. Momentum,
another horse that came out of the San Fernando, was pulled up well
before the wire and had to be vanned off the track. The best finish
for a San Fernando horse belonged to Fancy As, who was third in both
races. His trainer, Bob Baffert, said that Fancy As will test Mizzen
Mast again in the Big 'Cap.</TE>
<TE>   Giant Gentleman, sent off at 10-1 after running second in the
Malibu, was second again Saturday, 41/2 lengths ahead of Fancy As.
Favored Mizzen Mast paid $5.60.</TE>
<TE>   The 55th edition of the Strub, worth $400,000, added $240,000 to
Juddmonte's coffers and gave jockey Kent Desormeaux his second
victory in the stake and the first since he clicked with Best Pal 10
years ago. Desormeaux placed Mizzen Mast within striking distance,
never more than five lengths from the lead, and they swept past the
leaders at the top of the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we turned for home, it was just a matter of letting him go,"
Desormeaux said.</TE>
<TE>   Came Home, running for the first time since a seventh-place finish
in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile more than three months ago, made a late
run to win the $150,000 San Vicente Stakes for his fourth victory in
five tries. Jack's Silver was second, beaten by four lengths.  Came
Home paid $3.40 after running seven furlongs in 1:214/5 and is
expected to face Jack's Silver in the San Rafael on March 2.</TE>
<TE>   Ta Ta Be True, winner of the Pro Or Con Handicap, was vanned off
the track after the race.</TE>
<TE>   "[Jockey Pat Valenzuela] said he didn't know whether she was tired
or not," trainer Jack Van Berg said. "He just didn't want to take a
chance."</TE>
<TE>   At Gulfstream Park, in a prep for the Florida Derby, Showmeitall,
a gelding, won the $150,000 Hutcheson by a nose over Monthir, with
favored Maybry's Boy fourth. The time over a track listed as good was
1:26 for seven furlongs.</TE>

<HD>Modry Enjoys All-Star Moment</HD>
<DH>Hockey: King defenseman, a surprise selection, is touched
by his brush with stardom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jaroslav Modry was supposed to be in the desert this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The King defenseman had planned to spend the All-Star break in
Palm Springs with his wife, Jodi, recharging for the final 21/2
months of the season while his father baby-sat the couple's young
children, Jacob, 3, and Alexa, 13 months.</LD>
<LD>   The thought that he might actually be playing in Saturday's
All-Star game at Staples Center never even entered his mind.</LD>
<TE>   Three seasons ago, he played for the Long Beach Ice Dogs. Two
seasons ago, injury free, he was scratched a staggering 55 times.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after four seasons of toiling mostly in the minors, Modry
earned a regular spot in the Kings' lineup last season. But the idea
that he might be involved in the NHL's midseason showcase was so
farfetched that the two-year contract he signed last summer didn't
even include a bonus for being selected.</TE>
<TE>   "It never occurred to us," his wife said Friday, cradling her
daughter in her lap as she watched her husband skate through a
leisurely practice at Staples Center. "Everyone is like, 'Everyone
just has [a bonus clause]. It's standard.' But it just never crossed
our mind, never, ever, that we'd ever be here."</TE>
<TE>   But there Modry was this weekend, a living, breathing monument to
stick-to-itiveness wearing No. 4 for the World All-Stars in an 8-5
victory Saturday over their North American counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   A smile rarely left his face.</TE>
<TE>   "It made it special that it was in L.A. in front of the home
crowd," Modry said of his first All-Star game, even if he couldn't
wear his customary No. 44 in deference to two-time All-Star Alexei
Zhitnik of the Buffalo Sabres. "I don't think it could get any
better."</TE>
<TE>   Modry's magic moment was hard earned, his eye-opening first half
of the season having completed his unexpected rise from unknown to
All-Star.</TE>
<TE>   Having never before garnered more than 21 points in a season,
Modry, 30, has accumulated 31 in 53 games this season, among them a
team-high 28 assists. He is ninth in scoring among the league's
defensemen, tied for second in assists.</TE>
<TE>   "He made it happen on the ice," said teammate Ziggy Palffy, who
also played for the World team Saturday. "That's why he deserves to
be here."</TE>
<TE>   Still, when King General Manager Dave Taylor phoned last month to
deliver the news that Modry had been selected, his wife feared the
worst.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart just sank," she said. "I thought, 'We're traded.' Dave
Taylor's reasons for calling are, 'You've been sent down,' or,
'You're traded.'"</TE>
<TE>   Not this time.</TE>
<TE>   The only place Modry was going was to the All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   For perennial All-Stars such as Mario Lemieux, Patrick Roy or Joe
Sakic, all of them making their 10th All-Star appearance Saturday,
that might not have been such a big deal. But for a plugger such as
Modry it was a validation, an acknowledgement that his perseverance
and hard work had not gone unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't about to take the opportunity for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "All those years I spent in the minors, it was like putting money
in the bank," Modry said. "Now it's time to make a withdrawal."</TE>
<TE>   That's why he was in the Team L.A. store at Staples Center on
Friday, eagerly signing autographs for an hour as fans lined up to
meet him.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Ceske-Budejovice, Czech Republic, where his parents
and younger brother still live, the 6-foot-2, 216-pound Modry basked
in the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Off to one side of the store, his father looked on, beaming.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, he had watched as a swarm of reporters
surrounded his son and namesake, hanging on his every word. He had
watched him pose for a team photo with international stars (and
teammates for a day) such as Teemu Selanne of Finland, Sergei Fedorov
of Russia and fellow Czechs Jaromir Jagr and Dominik Hasek. He had
wandered into the World dressing room and seen his son's nameplate
above a locker, confirming his standing among the stars.</TE>
<TE>   And now a line of fans waited to congratulate his son and ask him
to sign their keepsakes. A few, Modry's most dedicated fans, wore Ice
Dog jackets. Others wore All-Star jerseys bearing his name, about 100
of which were sold that day.</TE>
<TE>   Overcome with emotion, Modry's father swelled with pride.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just thrilled," he said, his eyes growing red and misty as he
clutched his son and buried his head in his chest. "It's incredible.
I'm very happy for him."</TE>
<TE>   Said Modry, squeezing his father: "He's walking on the clouds."</TE>
<TE>   So was the younger Modry, his long stretches in the minors a
fading memory and his frustration with former King coach Larry
Robinson, who had wanted to turn the gentlemanly Modry into a
fighter, all but forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely touched me," he said of his All-Star experiences.
"It's incredible to be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   In the dressing room afterward, he was the last to undress, making
his way around the room to get a glove autographed by his fellow
All-Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Starting this afternoon, it will be business as usual, practice
with the Kings in preparation for Monday night's game against the
Philadelphia Flyers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to regroup," he said, "and try to calm down and go from
there. Get ready for Monday and go back to my day job."</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Might Rest After Today</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Back in the town where the coach hacks and the owner goads the
commissioner, fetches milkshakes and referees Globetrotter games,
where Shaquille O'Neal is as loathed as he is feared, the Lakers
arrived to find something to play for.</LD>
<LD>   It is not always so clear to the Lakers, who find themselves
amused by most NBA teams, curious of a handful, and wary of only a
few, a blind spot that has generated some humiliating moments. The
Dallas Mavericks, at 33-13, straddle the last two groups, despite the
Lakers' dominance in the series.</LD>
<LD>   They'll play today on national television, somewhere between the
breakdown of Tom Brady's ankle MRI and the interview with Kurt
Warner's former supermarket manager.</LD>
<TE>   After a brief practice Saturday afternoon at the new American
Airlines Center, two things became noteworthy: The Lakers are
considering holding O'Neal out of Wednesday's game against the
Chicago Bulls and O'Neal, ever the tweaker of authority, touted
Maverick owner Mark Cuban as the next commissioner of the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   The club continued to mull methods that would keep O'Neal off his
arthritic big toe, one of them being to take the better part of nine
days off--from today's game to the Feb. 12 game against the
Washington Wizards. Laker Coach Phil Jackson said that O'Neal could
play a few minutes in next Sunday's All-Star Game without undermining
that plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil still hasn't told me that, so I couldn't comment on that,"
O'Neal said. "I'm just taking orders. I'll just have to see. If I
can't go, I won't go."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal in street clothes would kill any intrigue in a Laker-Bull
rematch, the first time the teams will have played each other since
O'Neal took a shot at Brad Miller and paid three games and more than
$700,000 for it.</TE>
<TE>   "Recent history of what?" O'Neal said slyly. "I don't have any
history with the Bulls. What are you talking about, the thing that
went on? That's nothing. No, I have nothing to prove against bums and
has-beens."</TE>
<TE>   Presumably, Miller would be the bum and Charles Oakley would be
the has-been, though O'Neal would not confirm that.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has said he would pay any fine that came with a decision to
rest his toe. That said, Jackson is pleased to have had O'Neal make
it this far. Today's game will be O'Neal's eighth in a row since the
suspension, the last few--all on the road--fairly concentrated.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a high frequency of games and I would expect him to be
more symptomatic than he's been, really," Jackson said. "I know he's
not moving, not as active as I'd like him to be, but he hasn't
complained."</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks and their fans aren't likely to feel sorry for
O'Neal. The Lakers have won 10 of the last 11 games in the series,
and the last 22 in Los Angeles. The odd relationship between O'Neal
and Cuban has enlivened the series. O'Neal likes Cuban's irreverence
and intelligence, and Cuban appreciates O'Neal's irreverence and
game.</TE>
<TE>   So, who else should be commissioner?</TE>
<TE>   "He understands," O'Neal said. "He's not analog. He's digital."</TE>
<TE>   Cuban declined the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq is a genius," Cuban said. "I wouldn't want the job, but I
think if he doesn't get a job with the FBI, he might be the best
commissioner. The Big Commissioner. I would love it. Instead of
fining someone, he would just kick your [rear] and make you shut up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Coach Doc Rivers was angry that the Lakers chided Horace
Grant for missing Wednesday's game because of what the club called an
intestinal virus.</TE>
<TE>   "They embarrassed him," Rivers said, "and I didn't like that."</TE>
<TE>   The words "Where's Horace?" were written on a board in the Laker
locker room, along with "Shaq-arrhea," intended as a humorous
reference to Grant's ailment.</TE>
<TE>   Grant, who would have guarded O'Neal, also missed Friday's game in
Detroit.</TE>

<TE>   Records--Lakers 32-12, Mavericks 33-13.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Mavericks--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Lakers expect more defensive gadgetry from Coach Don
Nelson, so bent on beating the Lakers that he practiced Friday and
Saturday. ... Dirk Nowitzki fronted O'Neal during much of the Lakers'
98-94 victory in Los Angeles on Dec. 5, and O'Neal made 18 of 23
shots and scored 46 points. O'Neal also missed 12 of 22 free throws,
making the score close and causing O'Neal to remark, "I should have
had 60." ... The Mavericks have won eight of nine.</TE>

<LD>Here we are, on the road to find the next NBA star, in ... Slovenia?</LD>
<LD>   Yes, Slovenia. It's between Italy and Croatia and home to a
probable No. 1 pick in the 2002 draft, with more coming behind him,
so a general manager is now as likely to find himself in Ljubljana as
Durham, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   Something has changed. Europeans started arriving in the '80s and
'90s, but it took years to get them up to speed, as in the case of
Vlade Divac, if they ever did, as in the case of Toni Kukoc, now
coming off the bench with his third team.</LD>
<TE>   Now, Europeans adjust as fast, or faster than Americans,
suggesting something even more surprising:</TE>
<TE>   The European leagues are now as fast, or faster than the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   "Europeans are big, they've got great skills and they're more
athletic than we'd like to believe," says Indiana Pacer President
Donnie Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   "But the biggest reason [they adjust so quickly] is, they've been
playing pro ball. Peja Stojakovic was playing pro since he was 14. I
worked out Stojakovic and he was a great player when he was 18.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand, these kids are playing at the level
that's next to the NBA. It's a lot better than college. I don't mean
just a little, it's a lot better than college."</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA has been picked so clean, the lottery is now packed with
children. Last spring's top 13 picks included four high school
players, two college freshmen, two sophomores, one junior, one junior
college player, two Europeans and one lonely college senior, Shane
Battier.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA tournament may still reign as the game's marquee event
but the NCAA game is something else.</TE>
<TE>   Said CBS' discerning, NBA-loathing Billy Packer, asked by the
Kansas City Star to assess Kansas junior Drew Gooden, a likely
lottery pick:</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we elevate guys to a status that's unrealistic, so
they leave. There are 55 guys in the NBA that could still be in
college.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think Drew Gooden would be up for the Wooden Award if Dirk
Nowitzki were in school? Is Drew Gooden a finished college player?
No. But is he better than any of the guys that are left? Sure he is."</TE>
<TE>   Europeans start in feeder systems, under coaches trained by the
nation's top coaches. Top players turn pro as teens and play against
players 10-15 years older, including Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., top players spend summers in the jungles of Amateur
Athletic Union ball, which has been infiltrated by street agents and
hangers-on, all the way down to Myron Piggie, a Kansas City coach and
convicted felon who gave "improper gifts" to an impressive roster
(Corey Maggette, Mike Miller, Kareem and JaRon Rush). The system is
heavy on pandering, weak on instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Now more than 10% of the 430 players on NBA rosters are Europeans
and some recent arrivals have made stunning strides:</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic, Sacramento: Drafted at 18, arrived at 20, All-Star at
24.</TE>
<TE>   Nowitzki, Dallas: Lottery pick at 19, All-Star at 23. He's
compared to (gasp) Larry Bird and Rick Barry, which is dumb because
they were great playmakers and he isn't. Try a 7-foot, 230-pound
Reggie Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Pau Gasol, Memphis: A 7-foot small forward who's the
rookie-of-the-year front-runner. At 21, just averaged 21 points in
January and shot 55%. Ranks in the top 20 in rebounds and blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Parker, San Antonio: Starting at 19 for a contender ahead of
veterans Antonio Daniels and Terry Porter.</TE>
<TE>   Andrei Kirilenko, Utah: At 20, he's starting for Coach Jerry
Sloan, who has little time for rookies. Does little things American
stars disdain, like moving off the ball. Averages 10 points and 5.2
rebounds in 25 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Hedo Turkoglu, Sacramento: In rotation since arriving last season
at 21. At 6-8, can play three positions. Averages 11 points and five
rebounds in 25 minutes, makes 39% of his three-point shots and has
star potential.</TE>
<TE>   There are more who aren't as far along but are impressive:
Houston's Hector Torres, a Venezuelan free agent who scored 20 points
in four of his eight starts; Dallas' 7-0 Wang Zhizhi; Indiana's 6-11
Primo Brezec; Seattle's 6-11 Vladimir Radmanovic, and the Lakers'
6-11 Slava Medvedenko.</TE>
<TE>   And they're still coming.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, China's 7-5 Yao Ming will be a lottery pick if he's
allowed to come and two European guards, Spain's Juan Navarro and
Slovenia's Sani Becirovic, are projected to go on the first round.</TE>
<TE>   OK, how do you say "Marriott" in Serbo-Croatian?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   All-Star blues: Elton Brand was cheated again when West coaches
inexplicably took Wally Szczerbiak instead. Szczerbiak's having a
nice season as Kevin Garnett's helper. Brand is a No. 1 option....
Huh? The Nets, deciding they deserved two All-Stars, were actually
disappointed Kenyon Martin didn't make it. He's averaging 15.7
points, which doesn't put him in the top 40, and 5.1 rebounds, which
puts him behind a lot of guards. Said Martin: "I don't have a
reputation." Actually he does, but it's for flagrant fouls on Karl
Malone and Tracy McGrady that got him suspended twice.</TE>
<TE>   Scary story: Last summer Minnesota, desperate to end its streak of
first-round eliminations and pining for a low-post player, offered
Szczerbiak, then on the outs with Garnett, for Marcus Fizer. While
the Bulls looked for a better deal, Minnesota Coach Flip Saunders put
Fizer on his Goodwill Games team--and lost interest after watching
him play.... San Antonio's Steve Smith, insisting that, despite
appearances, former teammate Rasheed Wallace is human: "He's one of
the best guys you can be around.... People still give him a bad rap,
which I think is undeserved. He's a good guy."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Coach Nate McMillan on former teammate Shawn Kemp: "I've
always said that once Shawn lost his jumping, his legs, he would have
a tough time, simply because everything was about power. I didn't
think he would lose his legs due to weight, but once that was
gone.... Now he's out on the perimeter trying to do up-and-under
stuff but it's sad because he's still young. That's the part that's
disappointing, to see him like this." ... Flunks intelligence test:
Kansas' Gooden on the NBA: "I saw about two guys sweating. It seems
like the NBA is just pickup ball until the playoffs start. They're
getting paid so they're fat and happy."</TE>
<TE>   Heartwarming: Allen Iverson told Playboy he loves Larry Brown: "I
can't believe we used to bump heads like we did but if it got us to
where we're at right now, I'm glad we went through it." To which
Brown replied: "That's as nice a thing as you could say about a
coach." The problem is, Iverson said it in November, before this
season's troubles began.... With the 76ers righting themselves,
Brown, who had been noncommittal for weeks, announced, "If I'm back
anywhere next season, it will be with the 76ers." You'll notice he
left himself wiggle room.... 76er guard Aaron McKie, before the
Eagles were eliminated from the NFL playoffs: "All I would say to
them is to enjoy the ride because you never know when you are going
to be able to go on it again."</TE>
<TE>   The NBA Experience (cont.): Commissioner David Stern, unhappy at
trading Charlotte, the No. 27 TV market, for No. 43 New Orleans,
tried to get a late deal in Carolina but just took a shot at the
mayor, calling him "not overly constructive," suggesting it's a lost
cause.... Boston assistant Dick Harter, the Hornets' first coach:
"It's sickening, it really is. That's a great basketball area. Those
people poured out their hearts to us. They poured out their
pocketbooks to us. I guess this must be [owner] George Shinn's way of
paying them back."</TE>
<TE>   Oink if you love this game, or carpetbaggers before swine: In
Norfolk, Va., which pursued the Hornets, Smithfield Foods, the
nation's largest pork producer, considered buying naming rights to
the proposed arena. Possible names, suggested the Newport News Daily
Press, included Hog Heaven, Pork Palace and Pig Pen.... Nick Van
Exel, trying to flee Denver, reminded of his troubles with the Lakers
and then-Coach Del Harris: "I had problems there, too. But now they
got a better coach than they did when I was there so maybe I wouldn't
have those problems there." I'm guessing the Lakers won't pick him up
to find out.</TE>

<HD>This IOC Session Will Be Amid Blanket Security</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Rogge expresses confidence that Salt Lake Games,
which begin Friday, will be successful--and safe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>With soldiers toting M-16s guarding the doors to the Abravanel
Concert Hall, International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge
tonight will welcome more than 100 IOC members back to Salt Lake
City, site of the worst corruption scandal in Olympic history, and to
the United States, which the IOC has--as an institution--formally
avoided for the last six years.</LD>
<LD>   All signs are that the session, as the IOC's general assembly is
called, will be low-key, with no issues on the agenda demanding
immediate resolution. The mission here is to steer the Winter Games
through a new era of security controls.</LD>
<LD>   "I expect very good Games," Rogge said in an interview a few days
ago in his newly established Salt Lake office. He added that security
levels are "unprecedented," and that the IOC is confident in the
security plan; 10,000 policemen and soldiers are on hand, and their
presence is evident at every Olympic venue. He also said he believes
the American public "wants these Games to [succeed]."</LD>
<TE>   In his opening remarks tonight, Rogge said he plans to make
mention of the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches killed by Palestinian
terrorists at the 1972 Munich Summer Games. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of the kidnappings and murders. He said he is not
planning to refer to the Israeli dead at the opening ceremony of the
Games, on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC will also conduct routine business at the session,
including elections; business begins Monday after tonight's
ceremonial opening. Jim Easton of Van Nuys, a member since 1994, is a
candidate for an IOC vice presidency. Sandra Baldwin of Phoenix, the
president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, is the only American among
10 candidates up for IOC membership. The IOC currently has 121
members.</TE>
<TE>   In large measure because of the Salt Lake bid scandal, the IOC has
not held a general assembly in the United States, nor has its ruling
Executive Board convened here, since the close of the 1996 Summer
Games in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Various IOC members have been here, often to inspect preparations
for the Winter Games. Rogge has been to the U.S. on several occasions
since he was elected in July to an eight-year term as IOC president,
succeeding Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain, who had served atop the
IOC since 1980.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal erupted in late 1998 amid revelations that officials
in Salt Lake had given more than $1 million in cash and gifts to IOC
members or their relatives in their winning bid for the 2002 Games.
The scandal sparked the expulsion or resignations of 10 IOC members,
and the enactment of a 50-point reform plan, including a ban on
visits by IOC members to cities bidding for the Games.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of member visits to bid cities remains controversial
within the IOC, however. It is due to be considered at an IOC
assembly scheduled for later this year in Mexico, at which the
membership is due to take a fresh look at the 50-point reform plan.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge, like Samaranch, said he is strongly opposed to such visits.
But he said he is well aware that "a number of my colleagues" believe
that without visits "they cannot judge fairly" which cities are best
qualified to play host to the Games.</TE>
<TE>   If the membership votes to bring back the visits, so be it, he
said. But if the visits return, he said, it would be imperative that
the members visit in groups, not individually; that the IOC pay for
the trips, and that there be no "dining and wining." He said the
crucial thing is to ensure the visits do "not open the [door] to
corruption."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the reform process, meanwhile, the IOC has vowed to be
more open--what it calls "transparent"--in its financial affairs.</TE>
<TE>   A provisional 2002 budget, which Rogge provided to The Times upon
request, projects IOC revenues for the year of approximately $105
million and expenditures of $59.2 million, meaning a surplus of $45.8
million. The budget also calls for a $20 million grant to the Olympic
Foundation, an IOC investment fund, cutting the surplus to $25.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   The assembly is due to approve the budget this week. It does not,
however, tell the complete story of Olympic finances because the
movement is now a $1.1-billion annual enterprise, with the IOC acting
as a pass-through for vast sums of cash that go to sports
federations, national Olympic committees and others.</TE>
<TE>   The budget does show at least one symbolic sign that Rogge is
serious about his oft-stated goal of downsizing some of the trappings
that have come to mark the movement. Spending on "Olympic souvenirs
and promotional items" is due to be cut significantly. Last year, the
IOC spent $1.2million on such items; this year's budget line lists
$500,000.</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   IOC Wages</TE>
<TE>The International Olympic Committee has vowed to be more open in its
financial affairs, and in response to inquiries from The Times, the IOC
supplied a salary table for the 238 people it employs at headquarters in
Lausanne, Switzerland, and at the nearby Olympic Museum.
   The numbers show that 205 of the 238 make less than $73,500 annually.
Two IOC employees make more than $206,000 a year.  IOC President Jacques
Rogge, who receives no salary, declined to match names to salaries--saying
that's still private.
   The IOC salaries, with annual wage range, number of IOC staff members
in that range and the percentage of the staff represented:</TE>
<TE>$29,500 of less         33      13.9
$29,500-$45,000         86      36.1

<LD>The gold medal-winning goaltender from the 1994 Olympics, Tommy Salo
of Sweden, played the first period for the World All-Stars on
Saturday against their North American rivals in the NHL's annual
All-Star exercise.</LD>
<LD>   The gold medal-winning goalie from the 1998 Olympics, Dominik
Hasek of the Czech Republic, played the second period for the World
team.</LD>
<LD>   Does that mean Nikolai Khabibulin of Russia, who stopped all 20
shots in the third period of the World team's 8-5 victory at Staples
Center, is the next golden goalie in waiting?</LD>
<TE>   It's not at all far-fetched.</TE>
<TE>   The lure of playing for the legendary Viacheslav Fetisov at the
Salt Lake City Winter Games has brought many reluctant Russians back
to the fold, creating the country's strongest roster since the Soviet
dynasty ended with a last-gasp gold medal as the Unified Team at the
1992 Albertville Games. Khabibulin, Russia's third goalie at
Albertville, declined to play at Nagano four years ago to protest the
Russian federation's iron-fisted control of the Olympic team. He
changed his mind only after Fetisov, who ended a splendid playing
career with the Devils and Red Wings, was put in charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I was watching the Olympics in Nagano and I saw how excited the
players were," Khabibulin said. "It was really awesome to watch.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I saw Slava Fetisov would be the general manager and maybe
the coach, and he has a tremendous amount of respect among the
players and the fans. I was very excited to hear about that, and it
made easier my decision."</TE>
<TE>   For Russia, as for every team, goaltending will be the key in the
short Olympic tournament. But if Khabibulin remains as sharp as he
has been all season for the Tampa Bay Lightning and was again
Saturday in becoming only the fourth All-Star goalie to record a
scoreless period, he and his teammates could be painting the town red
at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Khabibulin downplayed the suggestion his performance Saturday
provided an indication of what to expect at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like summer hockey, you know, when everybody just
goes out and has fun," Khabibulin said.</TE>
<TE>   World and Russian forward Sergei Fedorov was also quick to
discourage that notion, but for different reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what you guys are getting at," he told reporters, smiling.
"I don't want to put too much pressure on him. I don't want you to
write about how great he is before the Olympics. It's better to write
about how great he is after the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   There might be occasion for that.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet hockey machine produced a score of great forwards and
defensemen but has developed merely one great goalie, Vladislav
Tretiak. Khabibulin, 29, is the best goalie his country has produced
since Tretiak led the then-Soviet Union to 10 world championships and
Olympic gold in 1972, 1976 and 1984 and silver in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some great goalies before," World and Russian Olympic
teammate Alexei Yashin said, "and I think Nicky just represents his
generation. He is probably the best goaltender from Russia and he
will be a big part of the Olympic team, especially because in a
tournament where one game can decide a lot of things, goaltending is
very important.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he is capable and talented enough. I hope he can do it."</TE>
<TE>   Yashin knows Khabibulin's capabilities as well as anyone. The two
grew up in Sverdlovsk, in what was then the Soviet Union, and played
hockey together as kids. They sometimes played floor hockey in
Yashin's home, destroying more chairs and tables than even the U.S.
hockey team did in its dorm at Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   "We broke a lot of furniture in his apartment when we were young,"
Khabibulin said. "We broke a lot of glass there too."</TE>
<TE>   Said Yashin: "We played a long time. Too bad it was my apartment."</TE>
<TE>   Their careers have followed strong parallels. Both were drafted in
1992, Yashin second overall by Ottawa and Khabibulin 204th by
Winnipeg. Both later were involved in long and celebrated contract
disputes: Yashin missed the 2000-01 season before Ottawa traded him
to the New York Islanders, and Khabibulin sat out nearly two seasons
before the Phoenix Coyotes--who had moved south from Winnipeg--traded
him to the Lightning last March.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very good for many years," Yashin said. "It's great to see
him doing well, great to see him back in hockey.... I don't think
it's really a surprise. If you have the talent, it's not a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Khabibulin also brings strong motivation to Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   As Russia's third goalie in 1992, he was entitled to a gold
medal--but then-coach Viktor Tikhonov appropriated the medal meant
for him. If Russia wins at Salt Lake City, no one will be able to
take Khabibulin's medal away.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have the same chance as five or six other teams do,"
he said. "There's so many good teams there with all those great
players. It's very hard to predict anything."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fedorov: "Hopefully, we will do well. We will come with an
open mind."</TE>
<TE>   And better than that, with a hot goalie.</TE>

<HD>Stanford Gets Burned by Arizona's Frye</HD>

<LD>Freshman center Channing Frye took his game outside and became a
factor inside.</LD>
<LD>   Frye scored a career-high 22 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as No.
19 Arizona defeated No. 18 Stanford, 88-82, in overtime Saturday
night at Palo Alto.</LD>
<LD>   Luke Walton and Jason Gardner each scored 20 points as the
Wildcats (15-6, 8-3) won their third consecutive at Stanford and
improved to 7-3 against ranked opponents this season.</LD>
<TE>   Curtis Borchardt had his eighth double-double of the season with
25 points and a career-high 21 rebounds--tied for fifth best in
school history--as Stanford (13-6, 6-4) lost for the first time this
season at home. Casey Jacobsen, who had 49 points Thursday night
against Arizona State, finished with 24 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Channing was very good," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. "He made
the most of his shots. We were able to free him more often than I
thought we could and Channing took advantage."</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats rallied from a 15-point second-half deficit behind
the accurate shooting of Frye, who was 10 of 13. He is shooting 76%
from the field over his last eight games. He had his fourth
double-double of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I came into the game wanting to stay out as far as I could," Frye
said. "When I made the first shot, I thought to myself, 'I can make
these.' Borchardt's a good player and the only way to beat him is to
stay outside."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona committed only eight turnovers, three after halftime. The
Wildcats had 59 in their previous three games.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Anderson's hook shot with 4:01 left gave the Wildcats their
first lead, 77-76. He also made a shot with 43 seconds left that gave
them an 83-79 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford couldn't get a shot off on its last possession of
regulation. Jacobsen was called for an offensive foul as the shot
clock was winding down.</TE>
<TE>   "Arizona upped the tempo, and we could not catch up," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "We had our opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford was one of 12 from the floor, including several missed
layups, in the final 11 minutes of play.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all Division I scholarship players," Jacobsen said. "There
is no excuse for missing layups."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   California 67, Arizona State 59--Amit Tamir scored five of his
team-high 13 points with less than a minute and a half to go at
Berkeley as the Golden Bears ended their first two-game losing streak
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Forehan-Kelly also had 13, Joe Shipp had 12 and Solomon
Hughes scored 11 for California (15-5, 6-4) who handed the Sun Devils
(11-9, 4-7) their third loss in four games.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Smith scored a game-high 15 points for Arizona State and
Shawn Redhage had a season-high 13.</TE>

<HD>Perez's Day an Unqualified Success</HD>
<DH>Golf: Rookie maintains four-shot lead in Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am and can win his first PGA Tour title today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PEBBLE BEACH</DL>
<LD>It's a long way from the Buy.com Tour to the grueling qualifying
school to the big leagues on the PGA Tour, but Pat Perez hasn't
exactly taken any short cut.</LD>
<LD>   Perez has earned everything he has the hard way and now he can
make it all pay off in a very big way. Perez, 25, playing in his
fourth PGA Tour event in his rookie year, has a chance to win the
AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.</LD>
<LD>   After he got through Spyglass Hill with a two-under 70 Saturday,
Perez will begin the last round today with a four-shot lead over Matt
Gogel. Perez is at 15-under 201 through 54 holes.</LD>
<TE>   Gogel, who had a 67 at Spyglass, is closest to him; Andrew Magee
and Lee Janzen are five shots behind. Magee three-putted his closing
hole at Poppy Hills to finish with a 67 and Janzen managed a
one-under 71 at Poppy Hills to stay within sight of Perez, who also
led by four shots after the second round, with Janzen in second.</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds like a lot, Pebble Beach has some recent history to
suggest it's far from over. Davis Love III was seven shots back of
co-leaders Phil Mickelson and Olin Browne last year, but shot a 63
and won. And Tiger Woods was seven shots behind Gogel with seven
holes to go in 2000 and won by two shots.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, Mickelson shot a 79 Saturday, finished at 13-over 229
and missed the cut.</TE>
<TE>   Perez has no idea how he's going to handle playing with the lead
on a Sunday, but he does know what he expects to happen. "I expect to
win," he said. "Four-shot lead, yeah, I expect to win. I'm not
thinking anything otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   A greater distance from Perez is Woods, who could get no more than
a 71 out of Pebble Beach and is 13 strokes off the pace. Woods was
floating near the cut line until he birdied the 16th hole to take
himself out of danger.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been a monumental missed cut. Woods now has made 80
consecutive cuts, dating to the 1998 AT&amp;T, when his missed cut was
something of a technicality. That was the year the fourth round was
delayed six months, from February until August, because of rain.
Woods, who was not in contention, chose not to come back in August,
but the official PGA Tour statistics ruled it a missed cut.</TE>
<TE>   Perez hopes he can duplicate the 30 he had Friday on the front
side of Pebble. And as good as he feels to have a lead, he is aware
of what's happened. "Four shots is nothing, you've seen it in the
past," he said. "I'm going to go after all the pins and make all the
birdies I can."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Smith is seven shots behind Perez after his 72 at Spyglass.
Everyone else is even farther back. Fred Couples birdied two of the
first five holes at Pebble Beach to close to within three shots of
Perez, but didn't make another birdie after the fifth. His 72 left
him at seven-under 209, eight shots behind Perez and tied with six
others, including Jesper Parnevik. Charles Howell had a 68, but he's
probably too far back at six-under 210.</TE>
<TE>   Couples, playing his fourth event in a row, says he isn't giving
up just yet, despite three-putting for a bogey at the 18th. "If I
have a hot round, I have a shot at winning, I guess," he said. "But
it's going to take a very hot round."</TE>
<TE>   The weather cooperated on a bright and sunny Saturday at Pebble
Beach, where the celebrity field was playing. As usual, you got
plenty of air time if you were a CBS star, but anyone unfamiliar with
Ray Romano or Kevin James might have felt a little left out.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Perez, who missed the cut in his previous two
tournaments but says he feels less left out every time he shows up to
play.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I learn something new, talking to somebody that's been
out here," he said. "I've been hanging out with Tommy Armour III a
little bit. He has been helping me out with anything from dinner
reservations to ... the courses, any kind of help he can. And Frank
Lickliter is my big brother, he has been helping me out, too.</TE>
<TE>   "You learn things, you know. I don't know if I'm a late bloomer,
but I'm just trying to get better every day."</TE>
<TE>   Perez had never seen the back nine at Spyglass, but he got some
help from a phone conversation with Jason Gore on Friday night. Gore
shared his knowledge of the yardage and had kept a copy of the pin
placements, so he was able to shed some light on that subject.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it will help, maybe it won't, but Perez doesn't seem too
concerned with how he will hold up coming down the stretch at Pebble
Beach. Before the season, he set a goal of making $1 million as a
rookie, but as for winning a tournament, that was almost too much to
ask. He'll find out today whether he's ahead of his schedule.</TE>

<KH>NIKE EXTRAVAGANZA BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Mater Dei Has Way With Oak Hill, 84-72</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it's the rims at the Pyramid. Or maybe because their games
have started after 12:30 a.m. Eastern ime. Whatever the reason, there's
something about the Nike Extravaganza that brings out the worst in Oak
Hill Academy, from Mouth of Wilson, Va.</LD>
<LD>  The Warriors, the consensus top-ranked boys' basketball team in the
nation, suffered their second consecutive defeat at the Pyramid in Long
Beach as Mater Dei led from wire to wire Saturday night in an 84-72
victory before a near-capacity crowd.</LD>
<LD>  The upset, one of the biggest in Gary McKnight's 20 years as Mater Dei
coach, ended Oak Hill's 65-game winning streak. The Warriors' last loss
came against Compton Dominguez in the 2000 Nike Extravaganza. Oak Hill
did not play here last season.</LD>
<TE>  Mater Dei, No. 3 in The Times' Southland rankings, opened the game on
an 8-0 run and never trailed. The Monarchs (21-4) led by five points at
halftime and by nine at the end of the third quarter before extending
their lead to as many as 17 in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>  Wesley Washington finished with 25 points for Mater Dei, which received
several standing ovations during the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>  Justin Gray had 25 points and Carmelo Anthony added 24 for Oak Hill
(23-1), which closed to within 39-36 early in the second quarter on a
Sani Ibrahim basket. But Trevante Nelson hit a three-pointer and made a
putback to put the Monarchs safely ahead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Vashon 70, Long Beach Poly 60--The Jackrabbits had the
home-court edge and the lead against nationally ranked Vashon--for two
minutes. But after Jackrabbit forward Bobby Jones drove in for a dunk off
the opening tip, just about everything went the Wolverines' way.</TE>
<TE>  Vashon (21-1), ranked as high as No. 7, used a 12-0 run in the second
quarter to take control against the turnover-prone and largely listless
Jackrabbits (22-3), No. 4 in The Times' Southland rankings.</TE>
<TE>  Jones, who finished with a game-high 22 points, was the only Jackrabbit
displaying much aggressiveness for a team that committed 18 turnovers.
Poly shot only 37.5% from the field in the first half and fell behind,
36-21, at the half.</TE>
<TE>  Vashon's lead ballooned to as many as 20 points on two occasions in the
third quarter after a three-pointer and baseline drive by Dwayne Polk (18
points). Nicholas Kern added 17 points and Donnie Jackson had 14 for the
Wolverines. Vashon's leading scorer, Missouri-bound guard Jimmy McKinney,
was held to 10 points on four-of-13 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>  Villa Park 66, Crenshaw 65--Forward Brice Prather, who finished with 22
points, made two free throws with four seconds left to lift the Spartans
(23-3) past the No. 17 Cougars (17-7). Crenshaw's Derrick Clark missed a
15-foot leaning jumper at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>  Crenshaw led, 65-64, after Clark was fouled on a short pull-up jumper
and made one of two free throws with 27 seconds left. Guard Marcus
Williams led the Cougars with 14 points and forward Onyekachi Ibekwe had
12. Guard Kyle Hogan hit four of eight three-pointers and had 20 points
for Villa Park, which outrebounded Crenshaw, 36-27.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Henderson (Nev.) Green Valley 53, Santa Margarita 50--Lenny Collins'
three-pointer with 10 seconds to play rattled in and out as the Gators
(22-4) held off the No. 8 Eagles (19-4).</TE>
<TE>  Green Valley, the third-ranked team in Nevada, won without having a
scorer in double figures. Mitch Platt and Ron Dunlap scored nine points
apiece and Jonathan Osborne added eight for the Gators.</TE>
<TE>  Collins, who led Santa Margarita with 20 points, could have tied the
score at 51 with his late three-pointer, but the ball bounced out of the
rim and was rebounded by Platt, who put the game out of reach by hitting
two free throws with five seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   La Habra Sonora 57, Corona Centennial 40-- Less than 24 hours after
losing to sub-.500 Fullerton Troy, Sonora (17-8) rebounded to upset the
No. 7 Huskies behind strong efforts from Jacob Trejo, La Rence Knight and
Travis Rogers. Trejo finished with 16 points, Knight added 11 and Rogers
had 10.</TE>
<TE>  J.R. Reese led Centennial (20-3) with 19 points.</TE>

<HD>Santa Margarita Girls Win Water Polo Title</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Margarita girls' water polo team routed Corona del Mar in
the championship game of the Southern California Invitational on
Saturday, but the Eagles had proven five hours earlier who had the
best team in the region.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Margarita's 10-4 victory over Corona del Mar gave tournament
organizers extra time to engrave the plaques. The third-ranked Eagles
showed they were No. 1 with a thrilling victory over Santa Ana
Foothill, The Times' top-ranked team, in the semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   "I was wondering how we would come back after playing Foothill,"
said Eagle Coach Scott Taylor. "They came back and played very hard."</LD>
<TE>   Santa Margarita's Kristina Kunkel, the tournament's most valuable
player, scored four goals in the 7-6 victory over Foothill. Erika
Figge scored the go-ahead goal for Santa Margarita (21-3) with 2
minutes 8 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Aimee Stachowski and Kacy Kunkel held U.S. junior national player
Gabbie Domanic of Foothill (24-2) scoreless and goalkeeper Kelly
Yoder turned away 11 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Stachowski then held Corona del Mar's top scorer, Christina Hewko,
without a goal in the championship game, scored two and assisted on
two.</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar (20-6) reached the final with an 8-7 victory over
Lake Forest El Toro, rallying from a 6-3 deficit. Hewko scored five
goals.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine Woodbridge had lost just three times in its last 50 girls'
basketball games, but host Brea Olinda proved up to the challenge
Saturday, defeating the Warriors, 51-42, in a nonleague game in front
of 1,000.</LD>
<LD>   Sophomore Lauren Pedersen's three-pointer 20 seconds into the game
initiated the proceedings and Brea Olinda, ranked No. 8 by The Times,
went on a 20-6 run to build a 25-14 halftime lead.</LD>
<LD>   Ninth-ranked Woodbridge (22-3) trailed by as many as 12, but used
a full-court press that limited Brea Olinda to nine third-quarter
points and at one juncture cut the deficit to three. The Ladycats
(17-6) never allowed Woodbridge closer than four points thereafter.</LD>
<TE>   Carrie Noyes finished with a team-high 12 points on five-of-seven
shooting, and had six rebounds and two blocks. Pedersen finished with
11 points, seven rebounds, five assists and two steals.</TE>
<TE>   Junior guard Jennifer Katsuyama played her second consecutive game
after missing most of the season because of a knee injury. She
contributed four fourth-quarter points and two assists.</TE>
<TE>   Alia Stewart scored 13 points, Michelle Sanford had eight and
Kathryn Geneau and Lauren Riley each had seven points for Woodbridge.</TE>

<TE>   Troy 58, Bishop Montgomery 53--Amanda Livingston scored 18 of her
22 points in the second half and also had eight rebounds to help No.
7 Fullerton Troy (22-2) defeat No. 6 Bishop Montgomery (19-5) in a
nonleague game at Bishop Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   Troy trailed, 23-21, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Livingston scored 10 consecutive points in a 2 1/2-minute span
down the stretch, including two free throws to put Troy up, 56-53,
with 19 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   In boys' basketball:</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax 77, Modesto Christian 60--Evan Burns scored 11 of his 18
points in the fourth quarter and Fairfax (24-3) closed the game with
a 36-19 run for a victory over Modesto Christian, last season's state
Division I runner-up, in the Sylmar Extravaganza at College of the
Canyons.</TE>
<TE>   Four other players hit double figures for Fairfax, ranked fifth in
the region by The Times. Kevin Bell had 16, Thomas Woods 11 and Alex
Bausley and Fernando Sampson each had 10. James Noel led Modesto
Christian (17-9) with 19 points.</TE>

<LD>Among those watching the Gold Cup tournament at the Rose Bowl the
last couple of weeks have been two coaches with familiar names.</LD>
<LD>   One is Bora Milutinovic, who in 1991 coached the United States to
its first Gold Cup title and three years later became only the second
coach in history to lead the U.S. beyond the first round of the World
Cup.</LD>
<LD>   The other is Steve Sampson, who along with Sigi Schmid was one of
Milutinovic's assistants in 1994 and who went on to coach the
American team in the France '98 World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   Both men will have looked upon the U.S. squad with some interest.
Milutinovic is sure to have recognized Cobi Jones, a World Cup
starter in the 1994, and Jeff Agoos, who was one of his final cuts
from that team.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson will have noted that, besides Jones and Agoos, Coach Bruce
Arena's Gold Cup roster includes Kasey Keller, Eddie Pope, Frankie
Hejduk, Brian Maisonneuve and Brian McBride--all members of the
much-lambasted 1998 World Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   Neither will it have escaped Sampson's attention that absent from
the Gold Cup, but quite likely to be part of Arena's roster for this
summer's World Cup in Japan and South Korea, are Brad Friedel, David
Regis, Claudio Reyna, Earnie Stewart and Joe-Max Moore, five more
players from his '98 team.</TE>
<TE>   The point here is, by the time the May 21 deadline arrives for
Arena to announce his 23-man World Cup roster, it is conceivable that
half the squad will be holdovers from the France '98 team that was
swept by Germany, Iran and Yugoslavia in its three first-round games.</TE>
<TE>   Arena is not about to tip his hand, however. There are too many
things that can go wrong between now and June 5, when the U.S. opens
its World Cup account against Portugal in Suwon, South Korea, with
South Korea and Poland waiting in the wings.</TE>
<TE>   Asked before the Gold Cup began how many roster spots were still
in serious contention, Arena deflected the question.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how I can really answer that," he said. "A lot of
things can happen during a year. If we experience the same number of
injuries we experienced last year [when McBride, Pope, Reyna, Clint
Mathis, Josh Wolff and Ante Razov were among a slew of players
injured], there could be 15 spots open on this roster.</TE>
<TE>   "So it's hard for me to say in January 2002 how many spots are
open. We're hopeful that Mathis comes back at full strength, Pope
comes back at full strength, McBride, etc., etc.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many questions about players at this point, and
things are going to happen during the year, like they happen every
year. I think I'd be foolish right now to lock myself in to saying
we're set at a bunch of positions. I think we still need to keep an
open mind and watch how players move along during the year."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Arena was willing to indicate that at least some names
already are written in ink, barring injury.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, you'd have to think that if Friedel and Keller are
healthy, they're part of it [the World Cup 2002 roster]," he said.
"You'd have to think that Reyna is part of it. Stewart is part of it.
Those type of players.</TE>
<TE>   "There are probably 10 of those guys that I can think of off the
top of my head who we would clearly pencil in as being part of our
roster, but there are still a lot of questions that need to be
answered before we make some final decisions."</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Cup has helped answer some of them.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming that Arena's 10 sure bets are Keller, Friedel, Tony
Meola, Agoos, Jones, Reyna, Stewart, Moore, McBride and Chris Armas,
13 spots are open.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by their Gold Cup performances, teenagers Landon Donovan
and DaMarcus Beasley will be in the mix when Arena has to make his
call.</TE>
<TE>   If Wolff and Mathis continue to progress and eventually regain
their form of a year ago, before injuries sidelined them for long
spells, they also are certain of a trip to Korea/Japan '02. The same
goes for Pope.</TE>
<TE>   The French-based Regis is still in the picture as the starting
left back, although Carlos Bocanegra has turned in a solid
performance in the Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Vanney remains a longshot.</TE>
<TE>   At right back, Arena still is uncertain about European-based Steve
Cherundolo, Tony Sanneh and Hejduk, whose Gold Cup play has put him
back in a favorable light. Pope could play out there too.</TE>
<TE>   With Agoos sure to occupy one centerback position, the other could
go to Pope, or to Carlos Llamosa. Gregg Berhalter is a possibility,
and Pablo Mastroeni is making a strong late run. Danny Califf will
have to wait until 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Armas, Reyna and Stewart are virtually assured three of the
starting midfield slots, and the Netherlands-based John O'Brien could
find himself in a battle with Donovan and others for the fourth.
Jones probably will be used as an off-the-bench weapon, as will
Beasley. Sanneh could fill in here, as could Maisonneuve, if Arena
wants to be defensive. Eddie Lewis has not yet shown enough to earn a
place.</TE>
<TE>   Up front, Razov will have to do a lot more to make the 2002 squad,
and Jovan Kirovski's national team days surely are over.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, much depends on how Arena intends to divide his team
among defenders, midfielders and forwards. He will take three
goalkeepers, for sure, but the balance among the other 20 players
will depend on whether he wants to try to win at the World Cup, or
simply avoid losing.</TE>
<TE>   A long spring of difficult games and even more difficult decisions
lies ahead, but these are the 23 players who, at the moment, would
appear to have the edge:</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeepers: Keller, Friedel, Meola.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders: Agoos, Pope, Llamosa, Regis, Bocanegra, Cherundolo,
Mastroeni, Hejduk.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielders: Armas, Reyna, O'Brien, Stewart, Jones, Sanneh,
Donovan, Beasley.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards: McBride, Moore, Mathis, Wolff.</TE>

<LD>Thanks to the Internet, college football fans can spend day and night
clicking their mouses trying to check out the latest rumor detailing
where the nation's top high school players are headed.</LD>
<LD>   It's a 365-day obsession, culminating in letter-of-intent day on
Wednesday. By Thursday, the process starts again, with the class of
2003 suddenly the focus.</LD>
<LD>   Feel sympathy for coaches Bob Toledo of UCLA and Pete Carroll of
USC. Their jobs are on the line based on the decisions of 17- and
18-year-olds. And their reputations are enhanced or tarnished
depending on the analysis of recruiting experts, many of whom have
never seen the recruits play.</LD>
<TE>   In truth, rating recruiting classes is hardly a science.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an opinion," said Brentt Eads of West Coast-based Student
Sports magazine. "The more I know in this business, the less I know."</TE>
<TE>   At least Student Sports holds a series of combines that allows its
experts to evaluate players based on speed, size and strength.</TE>
<TE>   Going into the final week of recruiting, Student Sports had UCLA's
recruiting class ranked No. 3 and USC's No. 11. But there are
differing opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills-based PrepStar ranked UCLA No. 6 and USC No. 9.
Louisiana-based Max Emfinger had USC No. 6 and UCLA No. 16. Orange
County-based SuperPrep had UCLA No. 3 and USC No. 9. Doesn't this
remind you of the BCS rankings?</TE>
<TE>   If you're confused, don't worry. The true rating of a recruiting
class comes in the years ahead, when players no longer can rely on
all-City or all-Southern Section recognition to hype themselves. They
must prove they can play in college games.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the experts are right. Most thought Matt Ware from Los
Angeles Loyola High was one of the nation's best. He started last
season at cornerback for UCLA as a freshman. Most thought Shaun Cody
from Hacienda Heights Los Altos could become a dominant defensive
lineman. He had five sacks as a freshman at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's future could be strengthened or diminished depending on
the performance of his two quarterback recruits: Matt Moore from
Newhall Hart and Drew Olson from Piedmont. They are the most
important recruits in UCLA's 26-player class.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have struggled since the departure of Cade McNown after
the 1998 season. The quarterback position is so shaky that Toledo
informed Moore and Olson they'll have a chance to compete for the
starting position this fall. Moore won't play baseball at Hart so he
can watch spring practice at UCLA and start learning the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Will Moore or Olson become the savior UCLA needs to fix its
erratic offense?</TE>
<TE>   Former California coach Roger Theder, Olson's private coach, said:
"He's the best fundamentals kid I've seen in 20 years. He reminds me
of a young John Elway. I don't think UCLA realizes what they got. If
I were starting a team tomorrow, I'd be living with him. That's how
good he'll be."</TE>
<TE>   Hart Coach Mike Herrington said of Moore: "Matt has unlimited
potential because he's played only one year [at quarterback] and is
going to get bigger and stronger and already has great tools."</TE>
<TE>   The best player in UCLA's class is tight end Marcedes Lewis of
Long Beach Poly. He's 6-7, 240 pounds, runs a 4.6 40-yard dash and
has the physical skills of an NFL player.</TE>
<TE>   The most intriguing player is defensive back Mike Nixon from
Tucson Sunnyside High. He finished as Arizona's all-time passing
leader, had eight interceptions this season, kicked a 52-yard field
goal and averaged 44.4 yards per punt.</TE>
<TE>   USC might want to start its own Long Beach Poly alumni association
with all the former Jackrabbits on its team.</TE>
<TE>   Four Poly players committed earlier to the Trojans, but only one,
defensive tackle Manuel Wright, is certain.</TE>
<TE>   If Darnell Bing, Winston Justice and Hershel Dennis join him,
Carroll should start dancing.</TE>
<TE>   USC fans probably won't learn until Wednesday whether they have
won the recruiting competition for running back Lorenzo Booker of
Ventura St. Bonaventure, the No. 1 prospect in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a scenario next fall with USC having as its running backs
Booker, Justin Fargas and an injury-free Sultan McCullough.</TE>
<TE>   Those are three of the most prolific tailbacks in Southern
California high school history. If the Trojans can't run the ball
effectively with them, then everyone will know the offensive line is
the problem.</TE>
<TE>   And it's the offensive line where Carroll needed to make progress.
Kyle Williams, 6-6, 275 pounds, from Dallas Highland Park, should
help.</TE>
<TE>   But the best blocker in the Trojan recruiting class is fullback
Brandon Hancock from Fresno Clovis West. He's 6-1, 240 pounds,
already enrolled and has the strength of a college senior.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans beat out Stanford for Hancock, who could become
Booker's best buddy on sweep plays.</TE>
<TE>   So enjoy the arguments over whose recruiting class is best, but
understand one thing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a crapshoot, but somebody has to do it," Eads said.</TE>

<LD>Jerry Green didn't need any last-minute heroics for his latest
achievement. All he needed was one basket.</LD>
<LD>   Green became UC Irvine's all-time leading scorer in the opening
minutes and finished with 19 points Saturday in the Anteaters' 72-46
Big West Conference victory over Cal State Fullerton before 1,102 at
Titan Gym.</LD>
<LD>   Green, a senior guard and All-America candidate, has 1,797 points
in his career. On his first attempt Saturday, he went to his favorite
move, a fallaway jumper to his left that he sank with 16:40 to play
in the first half.</LD>
<TE>   "It took a lot of the pressure off me," he said. "I'm glad it's
out of the way and now we can move on."</TE>
<TE>   With the basket, Green passed Tod Murphy. Murphy, now a UC
Riverside assistant, had 1,778 and watched the guard tie the mark
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great honor," Green said. "It's a big accomplishment.
Hopefully nobody will break it."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine (16-6, 9-2) led, 26-21, at halftime but eventually put away
the outmanned Titans with a 46-point second half. The Anteaters
remained one game ahead of Utah State, which defeated Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo. Seven-foot sophomore center Adam Parada made all five of
his shots in the first half and finished with 19 points on
eight-for-10 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton (4-16, 1-10) lost its fourth in a row and 11th in 12
games. Without Josh Fischer, a 6-foot-9 reserve forward who has sat
out the last six games with a recurring irregular heartbeat, the
Titans have no depth inside other than starters Pape Sow and Babacar
Camara.</TE>
<TE>   Sow led Fullerton for the fifth consecutive game with 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach St. 69, UC Riverside 66--Travis Reed scored a
career-high 31 points on 12 of 18 shooting and the 49ers held off a
late rally for a Big West victory at Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State (8-14, 4-7 Big West) led most of the first half
and never trailed in the second, but the Highlanders closed to within
65-63 with 17 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Johnson sank two free throws for the 49ers, but Riverside's
Kevin Butler hit a running three-pointer with four seconds left to
make it 67-66. The 49ers' Michael Darrett hit two free throws with
2.7 seconds left, and Riverside's Vili Morton fumbled the inbounds
pass as the clock ran out on the Highlanders (6-13, 3-8).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Idaho 40, UC Santa Barbara 37--David Howell made nine consecutive
free throws to help the Vandals win the low-scoring Big West affair
at Moscow, Idaho. The Vandals (7-13, 4-7) avenged its Jan. 3 loss to
Santa Barbara (12-8, 6-5).</TE>

<HD>Pepperdine Staves Off Upset Bid</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three days after cruising to a 25-point victory, Pepperdine nearly
got taken for a ride Saturday night in a rematch with emotionally
charged Loyola Marymount.</LD>
<LD>   But the Waves managed to stay on course in their pursuit of the
West Coast Conference title, rallying from a six-point deficit in the
last 12 minutes for an 89-79 victory before 2,504 at Gersten
Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   Freshman guard Terrance Johnson scored 14 of his game-high 21
points in the second half, and forward Jimmy Miggins scored 10 points
in the last five minutes to help Pepperdine (15-6, 8-0 in the WCC)
extend its winning streak to 10 games and maintain a one-game lead
over Gonzaga for first place.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than blaming a letdown by his team, Pepperdine Coach Paul
Westphal credited Loyola for making the right adjustments after
getting blown out by the Waves, 84-59, Wednesday in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   "The main [difference] is that Loyola played so much better,"
Westphal said. "I didn't think we necessarily had a big drop-off."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Loyola (9-13, 2-6) was unable to avoid its fifth consecutive
loss--and eighth in a row to the rival Waves--after leading for most
of the second half. The Lions had success attacking the basket
against the taller Waves and appeared headed for a possible upset
after 6-foot-2 Robert Davis, who led Loyola with 18 points, dunked
over 6-11 Cedric Suitt for a 64-60 Loyola lead with 8:51 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine, though, maintained its poise and defensive pressure to
break the Lions. Miggins made consecutive turnaround shots in the
lane, and reserve guard Craig Lewis followed with a three-point
basket to give the Waves a 79-73 lead with 2:53 to play. Miggins
provided the clincher with a dunk after a steal by Devin Montgomery
for an 83-75 lead with 1:59 left.</TE>
<TE>   Miggins had 16 points and a game-high 12 rebounds despite playing
with a painful injury that Westphal said was either a strained
stomach muscle or bruised rib.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a real impressive effort by him," Westphal said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis had 17 points, including five three-point baskets.</TE>

Bearcats' nation-leading 20-game winning streak, and Memphis' 98-72
victory over Texas Christian might turn out to be turning points for
each.</LD>
<TE>   Marquette improved to 19-3 overall and 8-1 in Conference USA's
American Division. Memphis is 19-4 and 9-0 in the National Division.
The teams are not scheduled to play each other, but could meet in the
postseason conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati's loss leaves Utah with the nation's longest winning
streak at 13 after the Utes' 67-62 victory over Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   In knocking off Cincinnati, Marquette used the Bearcats' formula
for success--a tenacious defense and a guard-heavy offense to wear
down the opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The game was played in front of a record crowd of 18,698 at the
Bradley Center in Milwaukee, the largest to watch a college
basketball game in Wisconsin. After the Golden Eagles dribbled out
the clock, the student section emptied onto the floor and carried off
several players.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where we keep preaching day in and day out, which
[Cincinnati] is so good at, possession by possession basketball,"
Crean said. "I think that's why they won 20 in a row, because [Coach
Bob Huggins'] teams, they don't mess around with the game. They come
out there and they play hard every possession."</TE>
<TE>   The Bearcats seemed to get more flustered as they saw their
winning streak slipping away.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play with intensity on defense nor did we attack on the
offensive end," guard Steve Logan said. "I thought we were always
supposed to play defense. Out there today, we didn't play Bearcat
basketball."</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Eagles sure did.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Law-abiding: Clifford Reed was a winner in his coaching debut as
Bethune Cookman defeated Maryland Eastern Shore, 76-70, at Daytona
Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Reed took over Friday for Horace Broadnax, who resigned to pursue
a law career.</TE>
<TE>   Broadnax was a member of Georgetown's 1984 national championship
team after a decorated high school career in Plant City, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Broadnax never could have imagined fitting in at
Georgetown, let alone someday earning a law degree, which he did from
Florida State in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to remember, I was a guy from the country, somebody
who would walk around barefoot," he once told the Tampa Tribune. "I'm
in a class sitting next to a kid whose dad was attorney general in
Illinois. On the other side is a kid whose dad was senior vice
president of IBM.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the cream of the crop academically. If they got a C,
they were ready to jump off a building. They're saying, 'I'm going to
be a lawyer, I'm going to be a federal court judge.' I'm thinking,
'Man, you're thinking that far ahead? What's wrong? I'm worried about
getting through the next day.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Midnight Cowboys: Ivan McFarlin of No. 9 Oklahoma State had some
choice words regarding the social habits of some of his teammates
after a 70-61 loss to Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been going out to parties, staying up late or hanging
out with a girl all hours of the night," said McFarlin, who scored 14
points before fouling out. "That affects your play. That's going to
have to change."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thousand times yes: Three players reached 1,000 points for their
careers Saturday, two in victory and one in defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Bailey had 20 points in Bucknell's 74-68 loss to Lafayette
as he reached the milestone.</TE>
<TE>   Austin Ganly's game-high 21 points led New Hampshire over
Binghamton, 79-69, and Ganly into the 1,000-point club. Correy
Watkins also reached the 1,000 mark with a 22-point performance in
Radford's 70-52 victory over Charleston Southern.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three dog night: Speaking of Radford, the Highlanders saw the end
of a streak that had lasted more than 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Radford's run of consecutive games with a three-point basket was
snapped at 348 after the Highlanders missed all 10 of their attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the team failed to make a three-pointer was the
1990-91 season opener against St. John's (Minn.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the day: Dimeco Childress scored 35 points and had
six assists for East Tennessee in its 100-65 victory over Georgia
Southern. Childress made 14 of 22 from the field, including five of
seven on three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the weak: Harvard pulled the ultimate no-no by
blowing an 18-point second-half lead on its home court in a 66-57
loss to archrival Yale.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>How fitting it would have been for Jeremy McGrath to win the 25th
supercross event at Edison Field on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   But the series' winningest rider at Anaheim provided little more
than a big tease, as Ricky Carmichael won for the second week in a
row, taking Round 5 of the AMA/EA Sports Supercross Series in front
of 45,050.</LD>
<LD>   McGrath, the owner/rider aboard a Yamaha who won seven series
championships, thrilled the crowd early and led the first nine laps.</LD>
<TE>   McGrath has won eight events at Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath said before the race that he expected to begin riding more
competitively after battling "arm pump syndrome," a condition some
motorcycle racers experience that causes muscles in the forearms to
enlarge and harden, preventing riders from properly gripping the
handlebars.</TE>
<TE>   The first inkling that McGrath might be back on track came in his
elimination heat, when he finished second to Carmichael and ahead of
Team Yamaha's David Vuillemin.</TE>
<TE>   The heat was six seconds faster than the other heat won by
Australian Michael Byrne.</TE>
<TE>   Vuillemin, who won the first two races of the season, finished
third and kept the season championship series lead.</TE>
<TE>   Stephane Roncada finished second for Team Chevy Trucks Kawasaki.</TE>
<TE>   Mike LaRocco retained second place in the series by finishing
fourth, and Carmichael moved into third place.</TE>
<TE>   Brock Sellards of Sherrodsville, Ohio, rider for Red Bull/KTM, got
the second 125cc win of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing second was Chris Gosselaar of Juniper Hills, riding for
Doc Martens Honda.</TE>

<HD>Bibby Calls Fans' Jeers a 'Disgrace'</HD>

<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Oregon's intimate McArthur Court has a reputation of being one of the
rowdiest and most intimidating arenas in the Pacific 10 Conference.</LD>
<LD>   USC Coach Henry Bibby said that the 75-year-old court's supporters
leave much to be desired after the Trojans' 73-69 loss here Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "These fans are the rudest I've ever seen in the world," Bibby
said. "The things they chant are a total disgrace to the conference.
The things they say are a total disgrace to the University of
Oregon."</LD>
<TE>   Bibby was referring to the Duck fans' derisive chants of "Deadbeat
Daddy" and "Your son hates you" in reference to Bibby's
well-publicized strained relationship with his son, Sacramento King
guard Mike Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   The Duck fans also chanted "Oompa-Loompa" at 5-foot-9 Trojan guard
Brandon Granville whenever he went to the free-throw line, alluding
to the little people in the movie "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate
Factory."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojan coach has heard the same refrains at arenas throughout
the Pac-10 during his six-year tenure at USC, but he admitted that he
is growing weary of them.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you guys don't think I'm sensitive, but I'm just like
you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A mini-skirmish also broke out between an Oregon fan and the USC
coaching staff after the game when Duck fans stormed the court and
engaged the Trojan coaches in a heated shouting match in a tunnel,
allegedly bumping a staff member.</TE>
<TE>   No punches were thrown and no pushes exchanged, though USC
assistant Damon Archibald criticized McArthur Court security
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "He was screaming profanities and stuff," Archibald said. "It was
[lax] security, man. You have to go through a game like that and then
deal with this [stuff]."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon Coach Ernie Kent, who did not witness the incident,
downplayed it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a great college basketball environment," he said.
"I'm sure when we go there I'm going to have to face the same
things."</TE>

<LD>Singer-songwriter Marshall Chapman danced on the sideline with the
Vanderbilt cheerleaders. The Commodores hugged near midcourt after
the final buzzer, and their fans didn't want to leave. Then again,
victories over instate rival Tennessee are few and far between.</LD>
<LD>   Chantelle Anderson scored all of her 22 points in the second half
as No. 8 Vanderbilt rallied from an 11-point deficit to upset
second-ranked Tennessee, 76-59, Saturday night at Nashville.</LD>
<LD>   The victory ended a nine-game home losing streak for the
Commodores (20-5, 6-3 Southeastern) against the Volunteers and ended
Tennessee's seven-game winning streak. Vanderbilt hadn't beaten
Tennessee (18-2, 7-1) in Memorial Gym since Dec. 6, 1990.</LD>
<TE>   "Definitely a long time coming," Anderson said. "I'd rank it up

confidence booster for our team."</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Stanford 79, California 51--Nicole Powell had 16 points and

<TE>   Reserve Sebnem Kimyacioglu had 14 points, making four of five
three-point attempts for the Cardinal (22-1, 12-0). Kiki Williams had

without leading scorer and rebounder Ami Forney (flu) and reserve
center Olga Volkova (sprained ankle).</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Oklahoma 79, Kansas 57--Caton Hill, coming off an 0-for-10
shooting performance, scored 21 points on eight-of-13 shooting to

(5-18, 0-10) at Norman, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Duke 66, Maryland 55--Alana Beard scored 19 points to help

College Park, Md.</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Louisiana Tech 78, Boise State 39--Ayana Walker had 16

<LD>"The Actress, the Producer and Their Porn Revolution" (by Ralph
Frammolino and P.J. Huffstutter, Jan. 6) tells a tale that is more
revolting than revolutionary--and not because of sex and nudity. Ginger
Lynn Allen may or may not be the mother of Steve Hirsch's child, but she
certainly was his friend and lover, plus an instrumental partner in
helping him create a financial empire that will keep him in luxury for
the rest of his life. Yet this magnanimous character apparently doesn't
think for a second to come to her aid as she approaches 40, seriously
ill, stripping for salivating yahoos to support herself and her young
son. How does this louse sleep at night?</LD>

<TE>   I wonder how many times the article could have been written by just
changing a few names. How many women have been stripped of any semblance
of true life by flesh slave traders like Hirsch? Allen nobly accepts
responsibility for her demise, as well she should. But shame on our
country for allowing pornography to be legal. Free speech? More like
freedom to enslave, brutalize and leave women as ravished carcasses. We
have now gone so far in our society as to admire the marketing and
business genius of purveyors of obscenity such as Hirsch, Larry Flynt and
Hugh Hefner. Allen says that our country is sex saturated. I fear to
think what these sex moguls will push for next to satisfy the insatiable
lust. God help us.</TE>

<TE>   This is just another sad story to add to the legacy of the porn
industry. Unfortunately, men like Hirsch make all the money and female
porn actresses like Allen end up with nothing. A lot of the actors and
actresses come from abusive homes and have incredibly low self-esteem.
They end up killing themselves with alcohol, drugs or their weapon of
choice. They contract STDs or more life-threatening diseases such as
cancer or AIDS. Hirsch ended up on top by being a cunning, ruthless
businessman in a multibillion-dollar industry. Allen ended up being a
casualty of that industry.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Kasperson</TE>
<TE>   Tujunga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Actors and actresses often ask what their motivation is for a scene.
For most in the porn industry, the motivation is abuse. The next time any
of us enjoys the performance of one of these stars, let's ask ourselves,
"Is her motivation the result of her father raping her when she was 6
years old? Is her motivation the result of witnessing a loved one's
torture and abuse at the hands of a relative?" Certainly not every actor
in this industry has such a horrible background, but far too many do. How
does Hirsch feel knowing that his success is largely determined by the
ongoing sexual and mental abuse of his actors?</TE>

<TE>   Below the cover photos appears the line "The Fortune He Made and the
Price She Paid." It is disappointing that it leans on the overworked
theme of "woman as victim" to entice the reader because the article
itself indicates otherwise. As the title of Allen's autobiography
asserts: "I Did It. I Liked It. So What?"</TE>

<LD>The article "A Boy and His Tesla Coil" (by Andrew Vontz,
Metropolis, Jan. 6) missed the most important contribution that Nikola
Tesla made to the world. More than 100 years ago there was fierce
competition over how electric power should be distributed to take greater
advantage of the newfangled electrical inventions being devised,
including the incandescent lightbulb. Thomas Edison (the inventor of that
bulb) was pushing for direct current (DC) while Tesla was promoting
alternating current (AC). Fortunately, Tesla won the battle, for if
Edison had we would have a small power plant every half mile or so in
every community across the country.</LD>

<HD>Debunking the South Family Myth</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1980 my family took a ranger-led hike up Ghost Mountain ("A
Feral Family Album," by Ann Japenga, Jan. 6). Our leader had read Marshal
South's articles in Desert Magazine. At each of the stops along the way
he regaled us with the stories, describing how the family actually grew
radishes. At the top he excused himself to talk to a group of mostly
local men, and soon returned quite excited. Rider South was there--his
first time on Ghost Mountain since he had left 40 years before. And he
agreed to talk with us.</LD>
<LD>   In the first few sentences he debunked almost everything the ranger
had said. Life on the mountain was hell. I asked about growing radishes,
and Rider, pointing to the ground, responded, "How can anything grow
here?" The story of the South family seems a sad, almost tragic tale of a
man who victimized his family to live his dream.</LD>

<HD>Another Victory in the Quest to Transform Downtown</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The reinvention of downtown Los Angeles as a lively and interesting
place to live is no longer a matter of hopeful conjecture, but a
likelihood, if not an inevitability.  I'd been keeping a sympathetic,
though unconvinced, eye on the phenomenon for a couple of years, watching
the progress of prophetic redeveloper Tom Gilmore as he transformed three
abandoned buildings in the Old Bank District into 230 clever loft
apartments now fully occupied. What finally tipped the scales of belief
for me, however, was spending time recently with a chap named Mark
Weinstein.</LD>
<LD>   Weinstein is a 43-year-old son of Canoga Park. He has a floppy mop of
gray hair and enormous trouble sitting still. Trapped in a chair, he
continuously jiggles his hips, bangs his knees together and toggles his
feet from edge to edge. The man is a giant exposed nerve ending.</LD>
<LD>   Weinstein's company, MJW Investments, has begun work on a project that
likely clinches ultimate victory for the forces of downtown
transfiguration. Between now and the end of 2004, it will redo 10 mostly
contiguous old manufacturing and office buildings it owns along Los
Angeles Street in the Fashion District, producing 604 loft apartments and
something like 1,500 new residents for the city center. Eight of the
buildings compose an entire block between 7th and 8th streets. It's by
far the largest such effort ever undertaken downtown.</LD>
<TE>   Called Santee Court, it will cost $120 million. The zoning, layouts
and other so-called "entitlements" have been approved by the city. Final
financing, Weinstein says, is in his pocket. He vows that the first
phase, involving three buildings and 171 units, will be renting by the
end of next year. "We are a very proactive company," he says. "We never
let anyone hold us up."</TE>
<TE>   Standing atop one of his buildings, at 746 Los Angeles, Weinstein
looks down on the alley that connects the structures (he owns it, too).
Where I see loading docks, small parking lots and windblown litter, he
sees a cobblestone way lined with hip cafes, bars and shops that open all
the way through to Los Angeles Street. He sees a courtyard area with
landscaping and a fountain. "Like the Third Street Promenade in Santa
Monica," he says. "Like Old Town Pasadena." Santee Court will succeed
because it provides its own critical mass, while adding to the slowly
accreting mass destined to explode in a blaze of resident-friendly
redevelopment throughout downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein, who has developed 3 million square feet worth of
residential and commercial property (including in Old Town Pasadena),
describes himself as an "accountant-type developer" who doesn't take
undue chances. He puts substantial amounts of his own money into his
projects. Unlike Gilmore, he doesn't buy shuttered structures, but rather
"living buildings" with tenants who provide an income stream during
renovation. After purchasing the Santee Court buildings in September 1998
for $18 million, he waited to see if Gilmore's project would take wing
before committing to turning nine of his 10 structures into housing. All
604 of his proposed units, moreover, are designed to condominium
specifications, in case selling them makes sense in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Santee Court, Weinstein says, is meant to be "work force affordable,"
with rents starting at $700 (and a median rent of $1,200). He's
especially targeting city cops, firefighters, teachers and other public
employees. He has also earmarked 20% of the units for low-income people,
which allows him to sell special federal tax credits to investors.</TE>
<TE>   But Weinstein, bouncing fervently in his chair, says his commitment in
the latter regard is a matter of soul, not just sense. "I grew up in a
lower-middle-class family in Canoga Park. I used to look at the fancy
buildings in Beverly Hills and wonder why everybody couldn't live
together, so lower-income people could live with higher-income people and
they'd all get to know each other. I mean, when it comes down to it,
we're all the same, aren't we?"</TE>
<TE>   We sure are, but the suburban-sprawl mentality that's dominated Los
Angeles has pretty uniformly segregated like with like. L.A., however,
has about reached its physical limits, and a shortage of housing still
exists. The central city, with its sturdy, enchanting old structures, can
no longer be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, a young and vibrant segment of the populace has turned
away from the oxymoronic concept of a suburban city. Hungry for a diverse
and edgy urban life, they're devouring unconventional downtown living
space as fast as it hits the market. According to Central City Assn.
estimates, renovation projects and new construction will have added, by
the end of next year, something like 3,500 residents to the 18,000
already living downtown. Moreover, the new arrivals will be of the sort
who are bound to generate more nearby places to shop and socialize.</TE>
<TE>   What Weinstein and his eccentric ilk are riding isn't just another
wispy L.A. trend. It's the maturation, at long last, of an enormous city
that's been a flighty adolescent for much too long.</TE>

<LD>There was no badge for collecting during Phil Parlett's Boy Scout
days in the '60s, but that didn't stop him from acquiring a museum's
worth of Scout artifacts. Then again, Parlett never really left Scouting.
At 52, the West L.A. financial services specialist has logged 45 years
with the Boy Scouts of America, working his way from Cub Scout to Eagle
Scout and later Scout leader, Scoutmaster, explorer, advisor and
commissioner. Today he serves on the executive board of the Western Los
Angeles County Council.</LD>
<LD>   As a teenage Boy Scout in Venice, Parlett began digging into the
movement's history by quizzing old hands such as his late mentor,
Scoutmaster Bill van Slyke. The older men often handed over outdated
manuals and other historic knickknacks. "It was like tracing my roots,"
Parlett says.</LD>
<LD>   Volumes have been devoted to the uniformed boys' organizations that
appeared in Britain during the late 1800s. The British Boy Scout Assn.,
founded by Boer War hero Lord Baden-Powell in 1907, became the West's
preeminent group, reaching America in about 1910. (In totalitarian
states, imitation versions such as Nazi Germany's Hitler Youth and the
Soviet Union's Young Pioneers doubled as propaganda machines.)</LD>
<TE>   Parlett's memorabilia centers on the Boy Scouts of America, its family
tree and Baden-Powell ephemera. It includes about 100 American and
British uniforms dating from 1907, more than 50,000 international Scout
pins, patches and badges, a trove of troop flags and camping gear, and
about 4,000 books. Many items originated with the competing boy scout
groups that sprouted in America before Congress chartered Boy Scouts of
America for sole use of the name in 1916. A working rifle used for drills
by William Randolph Hearst's paramilitary-oriented U.S. Boy Scouts hangs
behind Parlett's desk, while scouting's more leftward ancestry is
represented by his manuscripts and rare volumes by pioneering
environmentalist and pacifist Ernest Thompson Seton, who collaborated
with Baden-Powell on the original Boy Scouts of America handbooks.</TE>
<TE>   From 1986 to 1998, Parlett showcased the memorabilia at his privately
run Western Museum of Scouting, next door to his West L.A. office. But
the collection outgrew the space and Parlett now exhibits the artifacts
only at Scouting events. He's currently seeking a larger location for the
museum.</TE>
<TE>   Parlett freely admits that Scouting has been a sort of family for him.
"My parents died when I was very young and I went to live with some
relatives back East." The predicament, he remembers, was bad, with
resentful step-siblings and abusive stepparents. "My grandmother lived in
Venice, so I wrote her all these letters begging to move [back to
California]. I was 12, and she was 80 and living on Social Security, but
she took me in." Scouting gave him the independence he needed to make
that situation work. "Without the Scouts," he says, "I'd have probably
ended up in reform school."</TE>

<LD>When Col. Griffith Jenkins Griffith gazed through a giant telescope
at the turn of the 20th century, he reportedly said, "If all mankind
could look through that telescope, it would change the world!"
Thirty-some years later, the Griffith Observatory opened to the public in
the park that bears his name. Before the observatory closed last month
for an expected three-year renovation, celestial navigators took a trip
up the slopes of Mt. Hollywood to the only place in town where a star is
still just a star.</LD>

<HD>Marcel Marceau Meets 'Radar Love'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Something about mimes really ticks people off. Maybe it's that
precious handing-out-flowers-in-the-Latin-Quarter thing. Or perhaps it's
the vague air of menace associated with whiteface. Either way, if the
anti-mime jokes, Web sites, "Why We Hate Mimes" lists and
mimes-versus-clowns feuds are any indication, the art of pantomime
doesn't look like much of a growth industry.</LD>
<LD>   But Derek Martin isn't just another arty gesturist. Martin, 28, of
Echo Park, is making noise with his renegade Mime Control troupe, a
rotating cast of postmodern marauders who perform "nouveau mime" and
interpretive dance routines to commercial jingles and rock 'n' roll at
private parties, galleries, restaurants and book signings.</LD>
<LD>   Martin, an accessories designer and former art student who cites
post-structural theorist Jean Baudrillard's book "Simulacra and
Simulation" as a major inspiration, sees the troupe as the perfect empty
mock-up of pop culture avatars such as boy bands and teen sleaze queens,
whom he views as mere lip-syncing pretty faces. "We're replacing the star
with the anonymity of the mime."</LD>
<TE>   A typical performance finds the 8-month-old crew clad in cut-and-paste
combinations of black and white, though players sometimes don colors when
representing past decades. Traditional whiteface often gets a rock star
tweak a la Kiss or Alice Cooper, and routines combine classic
climbing-the-ladder moves with lip-syncing and dancing to rock hits such
as "Radar Love." The group's 13 members, who include ad execs, writers,
accountants, actors, photographers and Martin's other art prankster pals,
strive to incite audience involvement through written or pantomimed
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the ironic trimmings, Mime Control garners its share of
derision, Martin concedes, but it was society's antipathy to mimes that
inspired him to start the troupe. "Mimes have an almost shamanistic
quality because they work with the stuff that people discard, like
silence and darkness, and it's mysterious working with the unknown."</TE>

<LD>Every rock 'n' roll film, it seems, has this scene: The scrappy
young musician walks wide-eyed into a record label  office lined with
glistening rows of  identical platinum records--the  star-making
machinery in action!</LD>
<LD>   The folks at Jewel Box Platinum have plans for that scene. Kids may
never stop dreaming of rock-star fame, but those generic awards are
changing. Jewel Box Platinum turns the standard-issue gold or platinum
record award on its head,  creating adventurous custom plaques from novel
materials such as guitar parts, rhinestones and speaker fabric. At the
Marina del Rey company, the standard metallic disc has morphed into ant
farms, shadowboxes, silk screens, 3-D art and fantastic wall hangings.</LD>
<LD>   Award certification plaques mark milestones in top-selling artists'
careers (gold awards signify sales of 500,000, platinum a million), and
recipients often treasure them for a lifetime. It's no surprise, then,
that well-known artists such as P.O.D. and the Deftones visit the Jewel
Box office to help the staff draft that perfect design. The company is
one of a mere eight certified by the Recording Industry Assn. of America
to produce commemorative plaques.</LD>
<TE>   The RIAA certified 327 gold, 227 platinum and 243 multi-platinum
albums in 2001. Each has an RIAA certification number and hologram seal
of authenticity, and production is tightly monitored. "Even if Madonna
calls me up and asks for a gold record," says company owner Deborah Lotz,
"I still have to ask the record company." The number of copies made of an
award varies greatly; in addition to the artists, industry professionals
instrumental to the record's success and performers' friends or family
often get copies, too.</TE>
<TE>   For Beck's platinum "Odelay," Lotz and her team worked into the wee
hours hand-assembling about 350 miniature hurdles along with trees
purchased from a hobby store on Astro Turf backgrounds for dioramas based
on the album cover art of a dog sailing over a hurdle. For the eight-time
platinum "Forrest Gump" soundtrack, a special Bubba Gump shrimp box was
constructed for each award, which included a single white feather
individually approved by the label's art director. In such a tiny
industry, attention to the details-- whether a perfectly fitted wooden
frame or meticulously placed pingpong balls--is necessary to stay
competitive. "It's not an open playing field," Lotz points out. "There's
only so many gold records a year."</TE>

<HD>Never Mind the High Praise. How About a Little Ink?</HD>
<DH>His Work Is Priced as High as $150,000. He's Been Commissioned to
Paint by the U.N. But There's No Place in the World of Fine Art for Yuroz
and Others Like Him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the night he unveiled his first life-size bronze, Yuri Gevorgian
seemed more than merely one of the city's great rags-to-riches stories:
He seemed a bona fide giant in the world of art. The once-homeless
painter and sculptor--who signs his work "Yuroz"--was a grinning,
engaging focal point of attention among 100 wealthy collectors and
dealers who gathered at his series of lofts in Los Angeles' downtown
Artist District.</LD>
<LD>   Guests sampled wine, ceviche and spring rolls, and were effusive about
Yuroz's boldly colored, often-erotic oils--paintings with lush contours,
sweetly upturned faces and harlequin patterns reminiscent of early
Picasso.</LD>
<LD>   A woman named Michelle Neild talked of a personal art collection
consisting of Picasso, Mir-, Chagall, Matisse and her No. 1 favorite,
Yuroz: "Nothing comes close to Yuroz in my opinion." Another admirer,
Steve Berglas, waved a hand at more than three dozen vibrant pieces
hanging in the main showroom. He labeled the psychological themes
unsurpassed: "Where do you find an artist who has that breadth?"</LD>
<TE>   Down the hall, in Yuroz's paint-splattered studio, hung a newly
finished work that the artist considered his masterpiece: a 16-foot oil
canvas of immigrants on packing trunks, the New York City skyline in the
distance, all conveyed on a background of burnt-orange and black. The
haunting mural was commissioned in 2000 for a series of postage stamps
and was destined for the United Nations headquarters in Geneva.</TE>
<TE>   Few who lingered to examine it, or who applauded after Yuroz stepped
to a microphone and related his own ordeal as an immigrant, would have
guessed that the prolific 45-year-old painter is still, deep down, a
frustrated man. Yes, he commands hefty sums--up to $150,000 for some
major works--a source of wealth that has enabled him to live as he
chooses. Two years ago, fearing an urban meltdown at the new millennium,
he moved his manager-partner, Deborah Murry, and their three children
into a six-bedroom ranch home in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Yuroz's disaffection concerns his legacy. Like any artist, he wants to
be remembered. But will he? Is it enough that he can paint for the U.N.
if he cannot land his work in any of the nation's major museums? Is it
enough to produce a substantial body of highly valuable work if he cannot
get so much as one important critic to review him? Never mind high
praise--just a little ink?</TE>
<TE>   Can a man reach the summit on the shoulders of a narrow group of
impassioned followers if the art world as a whole writes him off? Or
doesn't notice him at all?</TE>
<TE>   "where am i standing?" yuroz asks rhetorically on a day when we meet
for lunch in the Artist District. "I don't know that I'm standing
anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   He grows acerbic talking about the gatekeepers who govern the museums
of fine art. "If they are in a good mood, they say, 'This is a good
artist, let's have a museum show,' " Yuroz says in a thick Armenian
accent. "If they are in a [bad] mood, then you're dead meat. They reject
you, then you're on the rejected list. Is there frustration? Of course
there is frustration. There is a tremendous amount of frustration because
of the bureaucratic system in art."</TE>
<TE>   Art is a squishy subject, offering no objective standards of quality.
There is no way to establish for certain that one particular creation--or
one particular artist--is better than another. Yet there exists an
underlying framework, a sort of invisible scaffolding, that enables these
judgments to be made, for they must be made. Museum space is, after all,
limited. If art were wholly subjective, even the lowliest sketch artist
in Venice would command as many admirers as David Hockney or Joan Miro.</TE>
<TE>   Howard N. Fox, a curator of modern and contemporary art at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, notes that the art world is vast,
multifaceted and free-flowing. It is less a world than a universe
characterized "by every sort of creativity you can find. There are, in
effect, many art worlds, many audiences--and, far more than that, there
are many artists."</TE>
<TE>   And no god to rule this realm. "If you look at the range of activity,"
Fox says, "if you go to all the galleries around town, which is only a
small percentage of all the art activity in Los Angeles, you'll realize
it's almost a free-for-all. There is not a monolithic controlling body of
interest or canon of thought."</TE>
<TE>   Instead there are networks of curators and museum directors, each
looking for pieces that somehow fit an overall mission. For example, some
museums covet Western art: Remingtons and the like. Others, such as
LACMA, eschew it completely. A curator sees new art in the context of
what is already there. Fox cannot calculate how many paintings he might
see in a year. He attends hundreds of exhibitions. There are 50 or 60
galleries he visits regularly, and he might hit a dozen on any given
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, artists send letters, e-mails, slides, photographs.
They also call, inviting him to showings. And they offer Web sites. The
blinding diversity of all the work makes it extremely difficult for an
unknown artist to stand out. What it takes, besides talent, is often
time, a slow water drip that eventually makes an impression.</TE>
<TE>   Fox recalls his discovery of an artist named Lari Pittman, whose
reckless, baffling amalgams of abstract and realistic images first drew
Fox's attention--but not his enthusiasm--in the mid-1980s. "At first I
didn't get it," Fox says, "and it nagged me." The second and third times
he ran across Pittman's work, the name began to stick in Fox's mind. But
it took a full decade before Fox staged a museum exhibit of the art.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not this sudden epiphany," he says. "It's not like walking into
Schwab's and there's . . . suddenly another superstar."</TE>
<TE>   In art, a track record matters. Behind a painting on the wall hangs
all of the other paintings an artist has done. Though idle browsers may
never see it or think about it, the prior work provides context, shows
the line of the artist's growth and establishes his or her place in the
evolving art universe.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, no track record exists free of other influences. The
gatekeepers who interpret those track records also are subject to the
tidal pull of marketing, politics and certain biases that are ingrained
in the art establishment. These often involve a deep schism between
artists exalted as true creative visionaries and those dismissed as
commercial hacks.</TE>
<TE>   One of the raps against Yuroz, I learn, is that he ventured down the
path of commercialism early on, selling limited editions and serigraphs,
showing his work at expos where the fine artists rarely go. That is
enough to be all but blackballed by prestigious galleries and museums
that see themselves as the guardians of culture.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what it is? It's snobbery," says Liz Derringer, a New York
publicist and art agent who worked with Yuroz when he was commissioned
for the U.N. mural. "You look at a lot of these [fine] artists and
they're great. Warhol, Lichtenstein . . . they're fantastic. But are they
better than Peter Max? Are they better than Yuroz? Lichtenstein was doing
comic books. Warhol was doing soup cans. They got involved with the right
people. They got involved with galleries known for esoteric, eccentric
art. They had these dealers who made them stars."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein are examples of rare, transcendent
individuals who managed to bridge the worlds of commercial art and fine
art. But that was not by accident or solely because of the marketing
forces behind them, says Christopher Knight, the art critic for the Los
Angeles Times. What separates an elite artist such as Warhol from an
artist of lesser importance such as Max is the willingness to engage in
the creative issues of the time, to take part in what Knight describes as
an ongoing dialogue with other artists, curators and critics. Warhol's
famous design of the Campbell's soup can was more than facile
illustration. It was a subtle commentary on the prevailing theme of the
1950s and 1960s--that Abstract Expressionism had become the most
sophisticated form of American art. Warhol's design incorporates
"rectangular zones of color hovering in space," similar to those employed
by famed Expressionist Mark Rothko, Knight says. The medium--a soup
can--was a nod to the revolutionary vision of Jackson Pollock.</TE>
<TE>   "The slang term for sloshing paint on canvas . . . was 'soup,' "
Knight explains. "So Andy painted soup."</TE>
<TE>   At any moment fine artists are addressing an array of creative issues.
"They're all conscious of what that discourse is. It's complicated, but
it's real, it exists," Knight says. "Then there are artists who pay no
attention. They're the ones who are not taken seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Hilton Brown, an artist and art professor at the University of
Delaware who also serves as a consultant to the National Gallery of Art
in Washington, D.C., agrees but criticizes such thinking. "There is a
real problem," he says, because it ostracizes artists for choosing to go
their own ways. An artist, however talented, who remains outside the
prevailing dialogue virtually ensures that his work will be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "It has nothing to do, ultimately, with talent," Brown says. "The
dialogue . . . [determines] whether you're seen as an artist."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, some who followed the path laid out by the art establishment did
achieve lasting greatness. But there are others, Brown adds, including
Expressionists Clyfford Still and Mark Tobey, who appear in retrospect to
have been overrated, more fashion than substance. Although the works of
Still and Tobey still command impressive prices, they are perhaps no
better than some artists who followed their own visions into obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   Yuroz sees no sense in trying to become part of an "artificially
created" interaction. "Art is not a trend that comes and goes," he says.
"It's a timeless thing. The unfortunate part is, they take something so
unsubstantial and make the statement, 'If you're not part of that, you're
not fine art. If you're not in tune with them, it's not fine art.' That's
the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard."</TE>
<TE>   He recalls trying to show his work at a fine arts exhibition in
Chicago. "We sent them slides. They turned us down, saying we are a
commercial art." It was such a slap that he attended anyway, as a
spectator, just to see what met the lofty criteria for display. Yuroz
says he did observe some beautiful sculptures. But then: "I see
skateboards, painted. Skateboards hanging on the wall--five
skateboards--and each one they're selling for $25,000."</TE>
<TE>   There are two well-known art exhibitions every winter in New York
City. One, at the Armory, draws the so-called fine artists, Derringer
explains. The other, at the Jacob Javits Center, attracts the commercial
stripe. "It's a different crowd, a different audience," she says. "It's
like music--a different crowd is going to go see Sting versus Bon Jovi."</TE>
<TE>   Yuroz shows at the Javits. His presence there the past 14 years all
but disqualifies him from being invited to the Armory, says Murry, who
also is his agent. "We're not invited to [the Armory]," she says. "We
can't get in." It might have been wise to stop attending the Javits show
eight or 10 years ago if Yuroz wanted to enter the more elite Armory
circle, but the cost in sales would have been enormous, Murry says.</TE>
<TE>   "Yuri has such a huge following [at the Javits]," she says. "We
recognize the fact we probably don't belong there anymore. But it's
still, financially, probably the No. 1 show in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Yuroz has appeared more than once on the New York morning television
talk shows. He comes across well, with mirthful black eyes and a
crescent-moon smile that seems too large for his face. He is a natural
showman who loves people. At expos, he dips into a bag of marking pens to
scrawl drawings and signatures on the T-shirts, neckties and blouses of
his fans.</TE>
<TE>   "He gives so freely," says collector Chris Schran, who has seen more
than a dozen autograph seekers in line. "He works from the heart, not the
pocketbook."</TE>
<TE>   But Yuroz has defied the unwritten laws of the fine arts world by
being a tireless self-promoter and making his art, through serigraphs,
drawings and limited editions, available to all income ranges. He has
made headlines--and, presumably, sold more work--by drawing elaborate
human figures on the walls of hotel suites. It galls him to hear that he
should reduce his prolific output--hundreds of works a year--and make
himself more reclusive, more mysterious so as to win entree into art's
upper echelons.</TE>
<TE>   "Artists have the right to make a living," he says. "Lots of dealers,
lots of curators don't like that. There are some kinds of borders they
create and they judge people. There are so many politics, so many games
to play. It's a waste of time to kiss somebody's behind, to play these
games when I can sit down and paint."</TE>
<TE>   I first met Yuroz in 1992 while writing about the disparate lives of
truckers, prostitutes and the homeless in the swath of downtown east of
the high-rises and west of the L.A. River--a bleak expanse of warehouses
and razor wire.</TE>
<TE>   An art colony took root here many years ago and continues to survive,
like a patch of lichen on the permafrost. I wandered one day into the
gated sanctuary of Yuroz's building. There I found one artist who created
canvases so huge he had to hang them from high riggings before splashing
them with colors. Another fashioned 4-foot polystyrene orchids, dozens of
caricature blooms. Climbing the metal stairs, I found Yuroz's loft and
encountered languid lovers on black canvas, moods and simple arcs of
striking elegance. "Wow," said the photographer who was with me as we met
the artist for the first time. "You are really good at what you do."</TE>
<TE>   He had been something of a prodigy, only 10 when he entered art school
in Soviet Armenia. Yuroz later studied at the Yerevan University of Art
and Architecture and, for a time, supported himself by designing women's
clothes--outfits that were sewn by his girlfriend, Rose. He combined
their names phonetically, forming "Yuroz," and kept the moniker after
seeking his freedom and immigrating to America in 1985. If he used his
Russian name, he says, people would look for the Russian influence in his
work. He likes that Yuroz has no race, religion or culture connected to
it.</TE>
<TE>   His arrival in Los Angeles brought him an artist's full measure of
suffering: He slept on the streets and in a Greyhound depot. He toiled as
a carpenter and pizza deliveryman while working on his English. He
painted mostly at night. It took him three years to sell his first oil. A
rumpled mattress occupied the floor of his studio. One evening, as we sat
nearby sipping wine and discussing his life, he explained how he both
slept and worked in this large, cluttered room, his mind filled with
artistic visions. An inspiration would hit and he would drive himself for
four or five days, catnapping or forgoing sleep until at last his canvas
was done. "The biggest ecstasy you can have in your life," he terms this
frenzy of creation--a rush greater than sex.</TE>
<TE>   He was already on a commercial track. He met the glib, hard-charging
Deborah Murry in 1987 while she was running a gallery in Beverly Hills.
She took on his paintings and moved in with Yuroz a year later. Murry
immediately closed her shop and set out to bring Yuroz's art to the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "We sold to everybody and anybody walking," she says. "We were in 153
galleries and frame shops all over the country, in Japan, everywhere."
Yuroz was an overnight success--commercially. Eight hundred people came
to the first show. Every piece of art was sold. Yuroz's resume grew to
include many small brushes with fame. He designed art for the Grammy
Awards--figures encircling an old gramophone, floating on a blue-black
background. He has done pieces for the Suzuki Rock 'N Roll Marathon in
San Diego. He's been written up by newspapers in Cleveland, Miami,
Seattle. But museum exhibitions have been few and, literally, far
between: in Anchorage, in the Fuller Arts Museum in Boston, and in a wing
of St. Bonaventure University's Regina A. Quick Center for the Arts in
upstate New York. That show in particular delighted him because the
curator, a Franciscan monk, chose to display the erotic works.</TE>
<TE>   But the commercial tag clearly haunts Yuroz. Murry has pulled Yuroz's
work from all but a few galleries. "We're in 18 worldwide right now," she
says, and in none in Los Angeles. Her own reputation may hamper his
acceptance by the powers that be. "I'm a blabbermouth, I don't live by
their code," she says. "I'm not part of that group. Honestly, for Yuri to
reach the next level, he needs a new agent."</TE>
<TE>   Yuroz will not have that. But there are innumerable examples of great
and not-so-great artists who crafted the right image with sagacious help
from behind the scenes. Consider the class of conceptual artists who
emerged in New York in the last half century: they made us see the
landscape differently.</TE>
<TE>   They piled candy in a corner and called it art. They dared to play
with our minds, creating patterns and objects as non-art as they could
get--and branding it art. It was art by the mere fact of its
nonconformity--it was, even before the term, thinking outside the
box--and the media age embraced it.</TE>
<TE>   The movement was so groundbreaking that today's critics continue to
use it as a reference point. Yuroz himself keeps a videotape documentary
of the New York art scene as it existed from 1940 to 1970--an
intellectual round-table that features Warhol, Lichtenstein, Rothko,
Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Jackson Pollack and Willem de Kooning.
Some who were part of that sphere cynically acknowledged the role of
influential agents and dealers in making them valuable commodities.
Johns, for example, once heard that famed dealer Leo Castelli could take
two beer cans and sell them as art--a speculation that Johns himself
tested. He mounted a pair of cans as sculpture and Castelli promptly made
the sale.</TE>
<TE>   No one would assail the important work done by Johns, but the dubious
forms of self-expression by countless other iconoclasts such as Julian
Schnabel and Franz Kline have given many of today's artists
pause--perhaps rightly so.</TE>
<TE>   "Artists are very frustrated by the way the whole system works," says
Rom Romulus Yaari, a contemporary painter who lives downtown. "You go to
a modern art museum and you see a string hanging from the middle of a
canvas, and it sells for $300,000--and you wonder why. What makes this
fine art? Who decided this was fine art?"</TE>
<TE>   Hal Nelson, director of the Long Beach Museum of Art, candidly
acknowledges that luck and "big-old marketing machines" have propelled
many artists to fame, though some later crashed like Nasdaq stocks. A
case in point is Schnabel, whose career took off in the 1980s behind the
marketing exploits of noted dealer Mary Boone. Schnabel worked with
shattered plates--fragments that he stuck onto canvases with thick paint,
creating loosely composed images that were generally recognizable in some
way.</TE>
<TE>   "He became world-renowned," Nelson says. "He was in all the major
museum collections." Boone's reputation clearly carried him. "She was
seen to be a dealer who had her pulse on the newest, freshest artists,
the person who brought these new artists to the fore."</TE>
<TE>   Schnabel's art became extremely valuable, but only for a time. "He
fell far," Nelson says. "But he's still in many collections."</TE>
<TE>   During my research, I tour MOCA at the Geffen Contemporary, the annex
of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Little Tokyo. Among the works on
display: a fried egg on a wood table. A pair of worn boots on a pedestal.
Wrapped chocolates in a corner. Christmas lights lying across a hardwood
floor. Elephant dung arranged on canvas. A big cube of lard left slowly
melting. MOCA's chief curator, Paul Schimmel, says most artists selected
for the museum have proven track records. "We've shown, on occasion,
artists who have had insignificant exhibition histories," but those
exceptions are rare. "It's very hard on a young artist [to be showcased]
in an institution as big and as visible as MOCA. It can sometimes be
crushing." A lot of artists never break through until they reach 40 or
beyond, though the threshold is becoming younger. What's most important,
he says, is having an original vision, a voice that belongs to no one
else.</TE>
<TE>   "Originality, that's what it comes down to. It absolutely tops the
list, before issues of craft or execution or intellectual rigor,"
Schimmel says. "People are always saying, 'My son could do a Jackson
Pollack.' It's true. I could do a Jackson Pollack. It doesn't mean
anything. The question is, 'Could you have done a Jackson Pollack in
1948?' He worked at it. There was nothing for him to copy. He understood
the implications of what he was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Which makes me wonder: Is Yuroz original enough?</TE>
<TE>   He does more than paint. For several years, beginning in 1994, he
worked with ceramics. He does pencil drawings. He does bronze sculptures;
he completed one table-size work a year for four years before creating
his life-size rendition of two serene lovers, "A Delicate Balance."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all of the works--paintings and sculptures--are sensual, and
many share recurring symbols: roses and pomegranates. The 17-inch version
of "A Delicate Balance" is listed for $18,000; the larger piece, produced
in limited castings, is priced three times higher. At its unveiling
party, I run into an art collector who sees a failure of creativity on
Yuroz's part. To her, the oval faces, ponderous limbs and harlequin
patterns rightly belong to someone else.</TE>
<TE>   "That's early Picasso," says Barbara Sternig, a collector of abstracts
for 20 years, as she studies a bronze called "Together in Time" (a man
and woman draped around a guitar) in Yuroz's showroom. "He's extremely
derivative of Picasso."</TE>
<TE>   Yuroz concedes Picasso's influence--and also Matisse's--but says there
is nothing wrong with emulating a style you love. "Something gets under
your skin. It's in your work," he says--but it evolves, you make it
distinct. "If you have something to say, eventually you end up saying
your own."</TE>
<TE>   Crossing from the commercial realm to the sphere of fine art is
difficult enough, but it is all the harder without work that is fresh.
Whether Yuroz's work is sufficiently distinctive is a subjective
question. The United Nations has been tapping well-known artists for many
years to create a continuing line of special commemorative stamps.
Officials there reviewed hundreds of names and portfolios before
selecting Yuroz to illustrate 2000's chosen theme, immigration. "His work
is stunning," says Tony Fouracre, chief of the U.N. Postal
Administration. "The canvas is absolutely fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   But none of this translates into critical acclaim. Yuroz covers the
hurt by saying his spirit, his angel inspires him only to paint and
sculpt--and if it is appreciated, fine. Then he talks about building his
own museum to showcase the work he so strongly believes in. "It was only
120 years ago," he says, "that Van Gogh was trying to sell his paintings,
his masterpieces . . . and he never could sell anything. Suddenly he's in
the fine art museums. They pay $72 million. Does that mean that people,
over 100 years later, became so smart?"</TE>
<TE>   We walk together through MOCA's main hall where part of the permanent
collection showcases those masters who transformed modern art in the
1950s and 1960s: Rauschenberg, Pollack, Rothko, Robert Moskowitz. Yuroz
pauses, thinking before the vast paint-splash of a Pollack--"People go
madly, incredibly in love with this"--and admires the aesthetic harmonies
evident in works by Anthony Tapies and Arshile Gorky.</TE>
<TE>   Wall signs quote various artists. Franz Kline is one: "Sometimes you
do have a definite idea about what you're doing, and at other times it
all just seems to disappear." The room is filled with Kline's stark
canvases, various patterns of black bands crisscrossing backgrounds of
white. Yuroz examines them in turn. He scowls. I ask how long it might
take him to create one of these.</TE>
<TE>   "A half hour, maybe. Maximum. But it's not even the time--" He seems
agitated, then depressed. "To me, the whole room is very cold and empty.
I feel such an emptiness walking through here."</TE>
<TE>   We walk the empty gallery in silence, then he laughs, his eyes growing
mirthful again. He has been thinking about Kline's quote on the wall.</TE>
<TE>   "His ideas disappeared, and that's why he [was] doing this."</TE>

<HD>An Aristocrat's Mission of Mercy</HD>
<DH>Suraya Sadeed Has Been Smuggling Food Into Afghanistan Since 1993.
Now Everyone Wants to Get in on the Act--and There's Not Always Safety in
Numbers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL ALAN LERNER</AU>
<BD>Michael Alan Lerner, who was a foreign correspondent for Newsweek,
is a screenwriter and freelance journalist living in New York City</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's 10 a.m. on a crisp November day, and Suraya Sadeed bounces
around in a highly combustible natural gas-powered van over potholes the
size of swimming pools. We are traveling through Tajikistan's dusty,
desolate no man's land of minefields and barbed-wire fences toward the
Afghan border. Russian troops lie in the hills above with orders to shoot
on sight anyone attempting to cross over. Sadeed, incongruously, looks
like she's going to a ladies' lunch. Her makeup is immaculate. Her rich
black hair is carefully brushed. Her dark slacks and cashmere shawl look
coordinated. What's more, she's smiling.</LD>
<LD>   There really isn't much to smile about. What should have been a
six-hour car ride from Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, is going on 17.
The van's broken down a dozen times, the driver got lost, forcing us to
spend a cold night on a hard floor in a roadside dump. We've cleared
umpteen Tajik and Russian army checkpoints and now the van's beginning to
reek of fuel, making every bump we survive seem like a stay of execution.
Still, Sadeed is smiling. "There it is," she says, explaining that broad
smile. "There's my country." She points at the landscape, scarred by tank
treads during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan two decades ago. Just
beyond the drabness shimmers the green, fertile valley of the Amu Dar'ya
river, which defines the border of her homeland.</LD>
<TE>   Sadeed, 49, the daughter of a former governor of Kabul and naturalized
American citizen, is on her 18th humanitarian mission here since 1993.
She is single-handedly bringing in more than 200 tons of food to feed the
hungry. Her target: an estimated 150,000 displaced civilians living in
squalid camps on the barren, drought-stricken plains of northern
Afghanistan's Takhar province. They are mostly women and children, many
living "open air"--that is, without so much as a tent--and many are on
the brink of starvation. Compounding matters, Afghanistan's notoriously
harsh winter is almost upon them.</TE>
<TE>   Though she has been down this road before, this mission differs in two
crucial respects: This is her first trip back to her birth country since
her adopted country began bombing the Taliban out of it. It is also the
first time she is going in under the constant eye of a reporter as well
as a camera crew shooting a documentary about her for the Oprah Winfrey
co-founded Oxygen Media. For in a twist, the irony of which is not lost
on Sadeed, the events of Sept. 11 that thrust Afghanistan back onto the
world's center stage have also made her a minor celebrity on that stage.</TE>
<TE>   Sadeed's van clears the final checkpoint before the border crossing.
We unload and proceed on foot to the muddy banks of the Amu Dar'ya, where
two dozen members of the world's press--haggard-looking men and women in
their 30s and 40s--are already waiting to cross. The vehicle for that
crossing is a single battered pontoon raft guided by thick steel cables
attached to either side of the river. The reporters, all clad in
standard-issue Banana Republic photo vests and safari jackets, look
quizzically at Sadeed as she approaches--who is this woman being filmed
so relentlessly?</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly on a bluff a short distance away, two gray-black plumes of
smoke mushroom up. And then comes the sound--two eardrum-popping KAPOWS.
A pair of American B-52s, their four-engine contrails clearly visible
against the azure Afghan sky, have just dropped two 1,000-pound bombs on
Taliban positions less than three miles away. As the bombers arc around
for another strike, the excitement among the reporters is palpable. This
is what they came to see. For Sadeed, the bombings elicit a very
different emotion. Though she supports America's war on terrorism, this
is her country, and it is being pummeled. As she stands there looking on
as the planes drop a dozen more bombs on the nearby landscape, tears run
down her cheeks. It's an exquisite video moment and Sadeed seems to know
it, holding perfectly still as the camera catches it all.</TE>
<TE>   In 1927, German physicist Werner Heisenberg theorized that the
physical act of looking at particles in motion affects their behavior,
rendering their measurement, well, uncertain. Sadeed's most recent
trip--indeed Afghanistan itself--offers proof of the uncertainty
principle's peculiar adaptability. The founder and life force of the
Washington, D.C.-based aid organization Help The Afghan Children, Sadeed
and her bravery went pretty much unnoticed until the onset of "Operation
Enduring Freedom." For years she ventured alone through Taliban lines,
under the threat of death, over mountains on donkey-back in freezing
conditions, bringing in millions of dollars worth of food, cash and
medical supplies to those in Afghanistan who need it most--doing it all
in relative obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 changed all that. "All of a sudden, people in the press are
calling," she says. Flooded by media requests, she appeared on both the
"Today Show" and CNN as well as before Congress to testify on her
homeland's state of affairs. Diane Sawyer and Anne Curry both pleaded to
tag along on her mission, requests nixed by Sadeed and the Oxygen crew.
The effects of all the attention on Sadeed--and on Afghanistan
itself--will subtly yet profoundly change the variables involved in her
work. Call it the uncertainty principle as applied to war zones; the
upshot will be to make this mission the strangest she will yet undertake.</TE>
<TE>    First there's the entourage. (Normally she'd go in alone). Joining
her at Dulles airport is Dr. James King, dean of a medical college in the
Seychelles and experienced disaster relief worker. After seeing Sadeed on
the "Today Show," King looked up her organization on the Web and
initiated contact, offering his services. He gave as a reference Rep.
Karen Thurman of Florida, providing Sadeed with the congresswoman's
office number on Capital Hill. King, 47, tall, with the air of a 1950s
G-man, is bringing a trunk full of medical supplies and plans to perform
an evaluation at the refugee camps of what's needed for his next trip. He
chain smokes Marlboro reds and has the ashen demeanor of someone who does
so regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the group is Oxygen documentarian Randall Scerbo, a vivacious
36-year-old with long auburn hair. Scerbo has been working on this
project for the past three years. In June she accompanied Sadeed to
Kabul. The two have grown close. "Mother-daughter" is how Scerbo
describes their relationship. "Sisters" is Sadeed's gentle reprimand. She
has told Scerbo that she does not want the documentary to over-emphasize
that she is a grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing up the rear is Doug Hostetter, 57, a member of the Mennonite
Central Committee, the relief agency of the church, whose organization
has contributed more than $45,000 to her mission, and Scerbo's cameraman,
Bill Gentile, 50, a veteran war photographer and journalism professor at
Kent State University.</TE>
<TE>   We change planes in Munich to board Air Tajikistan's flight into
Dushanbe. The plane, packed with reporters, is an ancient Russian Tupolov
154 with frayed carpets and the pungent stench of high-altitude
flatulence. The toilets don't work and the air hostess looks like an
aging, bedraggled prostitute. As soon we are airborne, a group of young
photog vests stands and pores over a large map of Afghanistan. Sadeed, a
few rows back, looks at them: "Last March I was in Herat when more than
570 kids froze to death. I remember looking around for someone to take
their picture, to alert the world to what was happening. There was not
one journalist to be found." Sadeed stops in mid-conversation and looks
around in a panic. She locates a small black canvas tote bag, which she
places firmly between her feet. I ask her what's in the bag. She smiles
mischievously and opens it. Inside is a tan canvas sack marked "U.S.
Federal Reserve." It is full of cash.</TE>
<TE>   "There's $130,000 in here," she says. "That can buy a lot of food and
blankets in a place like Tajikistan." I urge her to put the money away
before anyone sees it. Sadeed laughs. "During the earthquake in '98, I
brought over $182,000. I had to strap the money to my stomach. The
Taliban [at the border] said, 'Why does a pregnant woman have to come
here?' I really looked like I was delivering. I then had to change the
money into Afghani--I had 14 bags--huge. The first helicopter pilot said
he couldn't take it all, so I had to find another one who would. The
helicopter had all these bullet holes in it. But we made it [150 miles to
Badakshan, the site of the earthquake]."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly the smell of jet fuel overwhelms the cabin. "Oh that's
normal," she says. "I take this flight all the time. If it didn't smell
like jet fuel, then I'd really be worried."</TE>
<TE>   Sadeed acquired her sense of style the old fashioned way--she was born
into it. Her father, Mir Abdul Aziz, served for 10 years as governor of
Kabul under the reign of Afghanistan's once and possibly future king,
Zahir Shah, after which he ran the monarchy's secret service. "He was the
king's right-hand man for 15 years," she explains, "right up until the
coup in 1973." Part of Afghanistan's small, privileged elite, she and her
10 siblings grew up in a big house in Kabul and enjoyed a lifestyle few
others in her country could. "We had gardeners, cooks, drivers. I didn't
know it at the time, but I was very, very spoiled."</TE>
<TE>   She was also very rebellious. "Not only did I not wear a veil--I was
wearing miniskirts and driving around on a motorcycle," she says. She
attended Kabul University, which is where she met Ghulam Sadeed, who
would become her husband. They moved to Beirut in 1977, both pursuing
master's degrees in educational psychology at the American University of
Beirut. Sadeed learned Arabic, one of the six languages she now speaks
fluently, and raised a baby, Mariam, now 27. In 1979 the Russians invaded
Afghanistan. Overnight Sadeed and Ghulam became refugees. "We couldn't go
back to Afghanistan because the Communists had taken over; we'd gotten
our scholarship from USAID and we would have been labeled CIA," she
explains.</TE>
<TE>   After two years in Germany, they settled in the United States, in
Arlington, Va. Sadeed's husband was hired as a supervisor for social
services for Arlington County. Sadeed worked for Georgetown University in
administration, then at the World Bank. At the same time she was raising
Mariam. In 1988, the Sadeeds became American citizens. She got a real
estate license and started her own company. "I hired about 10 agents. We
did well. I myself bought six houses, bought some land. One year--the
year before I quit--I cleared $179,000 after taxes," she says proudly.</TE>
<TE>   Then tragedy struck. In 1993, Ghulam had a massive heart attack and
died. He was only 47. "In seven minutes my life changed completely. I
gave up everything. The pain of losing him was just so overwhelming . . .
I just didn't care much about material things anymore."</TE>
<TE>   She decided, after a 15-year absence, to return to Afghanistan. Her
father, who had stayed there, was now dead. Her mother was living with
her in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to see how life was for the millions of people who also lost
their loved ones, who lost their fathers, mothers, husbands, daughters,
sons--how did they cope with this pain? When I got there, it wasn't the
same country anymore. My family home had been destroyed. There was
destruction beyond belief, and hundreds of thousands of people in the
middle of nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   She describes the incident that changed her life. It took place during
her first trip back, in the border town of Peshawar, Pakistan. Some 2
million Afghan refugees had recently arrived. "All these people were
swarming all around me when a woman called my name. She was wearing a
burqa and I couldn't see who she was. She said she had been in my
psychology class in college. She started laughing. She said, 'Remember
that motorcycle?' And I said, 'Who are you?' She said, 'I won't tell you,
but could you please give me 50 rupees because my child has no milk to
drink.' Can you imagine? I gave her the money and she ran off. I tried to
run after her but she disappeared into the crowd. This woman was like me,
educated, privileged. You can't imagine the psychological impact. She was
too proud to tell me who she was. And I thought, I could be one of these
people. It made me angry and that anger changed me."</TE>
<TE>   Sadeed returned to the U.S. and founded Help The Afghan Children. The
organization is small, with only three full-time staff and seven
volunteers, but deliberately so to avoid administrative expenses.
Virtually every penny Sadeed raises through periodic fund-raisers goes to
the people she's trying to help. She takes a salary of $2,500 a month,
she says. "We've raised millions, not just in money but also in medical
supplies, blankets--whatever we can get."</TE>
<TE>   Since then she's founded five medical clinics, one near the Afghan
refugee camps in Pakistan and four inside the country. Three of her
clinics were in Taliban-controlled territory. She closed them after Sept.
11 out of concern for the workers. She's had problems in the past. In
1998, the Taliban overran her clinic in Bamiyan. "We had a staff of 18,
mostly female doctors, and some 45 patients, mostly women and children.
They [the Taliban] entered that clinic and burnt it down--nobody got out
alive," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this, she says, the Taliban don't intimidate her. "I told
them, I was here before you and I will be here after you. Now get out of
my way." She founded 17 clandestine home schools in Taliban-controlled
areas. Until the recent U.S. bombings, she was directly involved in
funding the education of more than 400 girls.</TE>
<TE>   It's 4:30 a.m. and still dark when we touch down in Tajikistan.
Dushanbe is actually a pleasant city with wide, tree-lined streets
encircled by tall, snow-capped mountains. We pull up to our destination,
Hotel Tajikistan, which, alas, is not so pleasant. It is a gigantic
concrete bunker, a prime example of the kind of say-it-with-cement Soviet
architecture that mars much of the erstwhile Communist bloc. Inside the
hotel, it becomes apparent why Dushanbe, once called Stalinabad, merits
its former name. Like some sort of Monty Python parody, six people sit
behind the front desk, each meticulously filling out small pieces of
paper, everybody far too busy to help you check in. We wait another two
hours before we are finally each given small pieces of paper that we must
present to the floor lady, who will, at last, give us our room keys.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning Sadeed arrives for breakfast wearing particularly
thick makeup. Dressed in her uniform of pantsuit and silk scarf around
her shoulders, she's also blow-dried her hair. I ask her why. "For a
woman, makeup and looking good give you self-confidence. I learned that
in the real estate business. Today I need confidence because today I have
to negotiate," she explains. Sadeed is meeting a group of suppliers--all
male--to purchase the food she plans to bring in.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting takes place in the apartment of Qadir Bakhshi, a supplier.
It is up two flights of stairs of a shabby cement building. Sadeed, King
and the camera crew take off their shoes before entering a small
four-room flat. Tea, raisins, pistachios and dried chickpeas have already
been laid out. The chairs are red velvet with gold trim, the wallpaper
shiny silver with a floral design. On a TV in a corner, the American soap
"One Life To Live" plays in Farsi.</TE>
<TE>   Bakhshi and his associate, who bears an uncanny resemblance to
Sylvester Stallone circa "Rambo III," rise to greet us. They look like
heavies in a Bollywood movie. They speak in Dari, but the body language
of negotiation is clear enough. Sadeed uses her femininity to its maximum
advantage. She smiles, flirts, laughs at Bakhshi's jokes. She lowers her
head and looks at him coquettishly. He smiles back.</TE>
<TE>   In a quiet voice, she makes her pitch. She pleads for help with the
refugees. Her eyes well with tears. I look at Bakhshi, who is
Afghan-born, and can see that it's working: the man is moved. He sighs,
says a few words to Rambo. They leave the room to discuss the deal. As
soon as they're out of earshot, Sadeed leans over: 'His bottom line for
wheat is $400 a ton; I'm going to get it for $330. He wants $750 a ton
for sugar, I'll bring him down to $650. And I've already got him to ship
it and package it," she says, crossing her fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Bakhshi returns. They have a deal. Sadeed jumps up, ecstatic. She
agrees to purchase 239 tons of food--175 tons of wheat, 36 tons of sugar
and 28 tons of cooking oil. All for $116,000. Bakhshi agrees not only to
truck the food to the border, but also to prepackage it in 3,600
individual family packets. "We'll be able to feed over 25,000 people for
more than a month," Sadeed exults. Also included are 1,000 blankets. They
will sign the contracts tomorrow, when Sadeed will hand over half the
money, the rest payable in Afghanistan upon receipt of the goods.</TE>
<TE>   We make plans to leave for Afghanistan the following day, when Sadeed
hopes to intercept her convoy of 25 trucks at the border. But a problem
arises, precipitated by the sudden appearance in the hotel lobby of
Bakhshi and his three young children, each of whom suffers from a minor
illness. Bakhshi wants Dr. King to examine them. He has even brought
along a stethoscope, since King had said his disappeared from the side
pocket of his suitcase.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the rub. I have just made some calls on my satellite phone to a
private investigator in New York to check King's medical credentials as
there are things about him that don't seem to add up. King has recounted
doing emergency medicine in Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico and heading
medical relief operations in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane
Andrew. He has said he headed the main medical unit away from ground zero
in New York after the World Trade Center bombings. And he talked of being
the official flight surgeon for TWA and of actually having saved two
passengers' lives in flight on two different airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day at lunch he recalled an incident in which a Delta
employee refused to hold open the gate while he finished his cigarette,
causing him to miss his flight. To take revenge, he got hold of a pilot's
cap and, already wearing a blue suit, started walking back and forth in
front of the Delta check-in counter with a cane, pretending he was a
blind pilot. "Haven't you ever heard of flying blind?" he claims to have
told a little old lady, scaring her witless. He then got on the next
flight, still dressed as a pilot, and began playing with rosary beads and
praying. He thinks his tale is hilarious.</TE>
<TE>   I think his tale is disturbing; Scerbo thinks he may be a wacko.
Suddenly this humanitarian mission is turning into an episode of "The
Real World."</TE>
<TE>   It's just after this lunch that Bakhshi and his sick children arrive.
Sadeed panics: She feels she cannot share with Bakhshi her concerns about
King's medical credentials because it would cause her to lose face, an
event with consequences in these parts. But she is prepared to let King
proceed with the examination. I feel that allowing King to examine the
children would be criminal. We are about to have a spat when Scerbo
happens to spot Dr. John Peters, a member of a different relief mission.
Peters, 67, a hefty former Special Ops officer who broke his back twice
in Central America while jumping from planes with parachutes too small
for his size, agrees to oversee the examination of Bakhshi's children.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon I receive an e-mail back from New York that neither the
Florida nor New York boards of health--the two states where King claims
to be licensed as a doctor--has any record of a James Henry King in the
last 40 years. The State University of New York, from which King claims
to have graduated medical school in New Rochelle, does not have a medical
school in New Rochelle. He is not registered with the AMA, and according
to the AMA database of licensed physicians in the United States, there is
no James King with our Dr. King's birth date.</TE>
<TE>   I decide to confront King directly in the hotel's coffee shop. King
goes very still. He is unable to explain why I cannot find any record of
his being a doctor. I ask him if there is anyone in the United States who
could vouch for him and clear this up. He becomes indignant, vexed that
he was not confronted sooner, when the group's suspicions first arose. He
gets up and leaves</TE>
<TE>   . "I feel so stupid," says Sadeed later. She chooses not to confront
King. "If he gave an interview to someone, he could damage me, who
knows," she explains. She concocts a story that the Afghan authorities
are demanding valid accreditation from everyone: without a copy of his
medical license, she tells him, he will not be granted a visa to
Afghanistan. She suggests he go home. He agrees to do so without
argument. "The Real World" has become "Survivor." Exit James King.</TE>
<TE>   The 17-hour ride to the Afghan border in the aforementioned highly
combustible natural gas-powered van provides plenty of time to admire
Tajikistan's endless fields of cotton. It also brings out the growing
tension between Sadeed and Scerbo. The immediate source of the friction
appears to be that Sadeed has yet to sign a release granting Scerbo the
rights to her story. During the trip, Sadeed often teased Scerbo about
this, clearly enjoying the power it gave her. When Scerbo countered that
she probably didn't need the release anymore since her multiple
interviews with Sadeed were proof enough of Sadeed's cooperation in the
project, Sadeed goes completely still. She seems petrified of not being
in control. Now the two women, who have been so close for the past 18
months, are barely speaking. Sadeed starts to turn away from Scerbo's
cameraman and refuses to wear the mike.</TE>
<TE>     We pass through the final Tajik army checkpoint into Russian army
territory. There are still more than 20,000 Russian troops in Tajikistan
and they control the country's borders. At the penultimate Russian
checkpoint, there's a long line of trucks waiting their turn to cross the
Amu Dar'ya river on the raft, one at a time, into Afghanistan. Sadeed
checks to see if any of the trucks are hers. Alas, her convoy has yet to
arrive. I can't help wondering if Bakhshi and Rambo aren't right now in
some Odessa nightclub with a bunch of plug-necked friends, living it up
on Sadeed's money. Sadeed says she is sure the trucks will arrive
tomorrow. But she looks worried.</TE>
<TE>   We board the pontoon raft to make the crossing as Sadeed pulls her
shawl over her head to cover her hair. She will not be seen without it
again. She does this, she says, "out of respect for the culture." Just
then another pair of B-52s drops its ordnance on Taliban positions
nearby. Kaboom kaboom-- welcome to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   We arrive on the Afghan side of the river, haul our luggage and 120
bottles of water off the raft and wait. The half-dozen battered Russian
jeeps there have already been spoken for. Suddenly a shiny new Toyato
Landcruiser materializes for us, provided by an elegant Afghan who says
he recognizes Sadeed's voice from her frequent radio broadcasts. We pile
in and take off across the brown, desiccated plateau of northern Takhar.
"I remember when, not too long ago, all this was green and beautiful,"
Sadeed says, looking out the window. "Look what the drought has left us
with."</TE>
<TE>   We eventually pull into Khoja Bahaudin, a dusty, one-story frontier
town that could be straight out of a Sergio Leone spaghetti Western, were
it not for all the turbans and camels. Khoja Bahaudin serves as the
Northern Alliance's regional headquarters. It also serves as the Western
media's headquarters, with all the major television networks
commandeering houses from which to coordinate their Afghan coverage.
According to Mohammed Gull, the Northern Alliance's visa and NGO
(nongovernmental organization) coordinator in Dushanbe, some 1,300
journalists have been accredited with Afghanistan press credentials. It
becomes quickly evident that the influx of all the Western media--and
media money--has had startling effects on this subsistence economy.</TE>
<TE>   Take the price of translators and drivers. One Voice of America
reporter says: "During the first week I got here, the going rate for a
translator was $30 a day. It went to $40, then $50, then $60--then we
finally all got together and set a ceiling at $100 a day." The fight for
translators can get nasty, according to Hannah Beech of Time magazine. "I
was with my translator, who I'd been working with for a while, when
Dexter Filkins of the New York Times--that's F-I-L-K-I-N-S--comes up and
offers my guy $150 dollars, $50 more, to come work for him. Right in
front of me!" she says. "Of course, I had to match him."</TE>
<TE>   The scramble for translators also has seriously affected the various
aid organizations working in the area. "The NGOs lost all their English
speaking staff--every one of them," says Frederic Roussel, the co-founder
and program coordinator for ACTED, the aid agency that has spearheaded
relief efforts in the area. "The reporters were paying per day what my
guys were making in over a month."</TE>
<TE>   The largest recipient of all the media's munificence, though, has been
the Northern Alliance itself. Aside from the 20% the Alliance skims off
the top from translators' fees and 10% from drivers' fees, the Alliance
charges $200 for reporters' entry visa fees, exit visa fees and various
fees for day passes to go anywhere. And since the Northern Alliance at
the time operated the only helicopters in the region, they were able to
set the prices on air transportation as well. "Chopper ride from here to
the Panjir Valley? [a 45-minute journey]. Try $3,000," says Martin
Seemungal of ABC News. "It's an extortion racquet. It's incredible," adds
Refet Kaplan of Fox News.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmoud, a young Northern Alliance driver who holds a degree in
international law from Kabul University, says: "The Northern Alliance is
completely corrupt. They know they're not going to be in power for long,
so they're trying to make as much money off the journalists as they can.
That way they can leave with something when a real government comes in."</TE>
<TE>   We settle in the compound of ACTED, which has offered to help Sadeed
locate those in the camps most in need. We are six on the floor in the
small, bare room. The courtyard is filled with journalists sleeping under
tents. That night, I notice several of them eating their dinner from the
yellow plastic U.S. food drop packets. "Most locals won't eat it because
they don't know what it is, so they sell them in the markets, mostly to
the journalists," says Mahir Yaqobi, ACTED's deputy coordinator. "Each
packet goes for around 50 cents."</TE>
<TE>   And then, out of the blue, the deteriorating relationship between
Sadeed and Scerbo crumbles completely. Sadeed announces that she will no
longer participate in Scerbo's documentary, which Scerbo has spent three
years preparing. Sadeed tells her she is hiring another cameraman--she
will find one from the ranks milling around--the next day to document the
rest of her mission. Her reason: that Scerbo failed to properly
incorporate her company (a charge later shown to be groundless). "How can
I sign an agreement with a company that doesn't exist," screams Sadeed,
who bemoans having turned down Diane Sawyer. They are standing in the
makeshift press room. Other reporters, amused, start to take notes.
Sadeed is on a rant; she does not care. Scerbo is mortified. This fight
is not rational. It's personal. We are back in an episode of "The Real
World--Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gentile, Scerbo's cameraman, my photographer Chris Anderson and I
attempt to mediate, all singing in unison the Rodney King single, "Why
can't we all just get along?" Finally, two hours later, a deal is
brokered whereby Sadeed will allow Scerbo to complete her work if Scerbo
agrees to provide Sadeed with 45 minutes of her documentary (likely to be
90 minutes in total) to use as Sadeed sees fit.</TE>
<TE>   Onlookers are not impressed. "We're in the field, we're in a war
zone--and we're in a cat fight," notes Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, recriminations between Sadeed and Scerbo evaporate with
a visit to Qum Qishlat, a tent city of close to 8,000 people staggered on
the banks of the Amu Dar'ya. Many of the tents are no more than blankets
flung over a piece of string. Some are actually quilts sewn from the
yellow plastic pouches of the U.S. food packets. Dysentery and malaria
are rampant here.  Sadeed steps from the car and starts walking toward
the camp. She's immediately surrounded by women and children. The people
here are bone thin and many of the children have a clear blind eye, the
result of vitamin A deficiency. Sadeed talks to them and, most
importantly, listens to their stories.</TE>
<TE>   Jemagul, a beautiful 10-year-old girl, comes up to her and, at first
hesitantly, begins to speak. She also starts to cry. Both her parents
were killed by the Taliban, she says. She has six siblings, who are now
orphans. By the end, she is unable to see for tears. Sadeed takes her in
her arms and is also crying.</TE>
<TE>   She takes Jemagul's hand and they walk on. A man beckons Sadeed to sit
in his tent for a moment. Inside, his wife, Khair Nsa, 24, an Uzbek from
Takhar, is sick. The woman tells Sadeed she gave birth seven days ago and
now her child is dead. She doesn't know where her parents are, if they're
even still alive--during the Taliban's onslaught, they were separated.
She's been living in the camp for almost a year. Sadeed takes off her
black winter coat and gives it to the woman. "She was terribly sick,
sitting on the dirt, pale and shivering," says Sadeed. "She needed
warmth."</TE>
<TE>   On and on, Sadeed walks through the camp and listens to tales of loss
and grief. All complain of the bitter cold at night and their lack of
food. One man tells Sadeed that eight people have frozen to death in the
last two weeks. Women hand Sadeed their babies for her to hold, bring her
gifts of dried fruit, necklaces made from pistachios--whatever they have.
"Why do I do this? This is why I do this," says Sadeed. "It's so
important to listen to their stories. It's a release for them. They need
to tell their stories to another woman."</TE>
<TE>   It's 8:45 a.m. outside the mud village of Lalaguzar, and ACTED staff
have begun cordoning off three sides of a large, rectangular space on the
flat dusty plain before it. A desk and two chairs are placed in the
center of the rectangle and plastic sheeting is laid on the ground. As
the first of Sadeed's trucks arrives, backing into the rectangle, people
from the village and nearby camp begin to gather. Inside the rectangle,
local workers unload the cargo from the trucks, dumping out the refined
sugar in a huge pile on the plastic sheeting. Boxes of cooking oil are
stacked next to the sugar and 50 kilo bags of wheat stacked next to the
cooking oil.  By 11 a.m., a huge crowd has formed all around the cordoned
space. Women in burqas of gold, emerald, blue, white, green and yellow
sit huddled together on the ground like cooing tropical birds. Children
wait excitedly with school bags made from the plastic pouches of the U.S.
food packets. And the men of the village, old and young, stand patiently.
Distribution is ready to begin. Names are read off a long list compiled
by ACTED in monthly surveys of need. In the most orderly manner
imaginable, old men, young men, women and children step up to the table.
One by one, they get their names checked off and proceed to collect their
5 kilos of cooking oil, 8 kilos of sugar and 50 kilos of wheat, the bare
minimum that one family of six can survive on for a month.</TE>
<TE>   Sadeed watches from the side and smiles as the procession continues.
For five days in five different locations, she bears witness to the
distribution of her food. With ACTED's supplements to the wheat she
brought in, she will have fed more than 45,000 people for a month. That,
indeed, is something Sadeed can smile about. And Scerbo will have filmed
it all. But the women's relationship has cooled to the purely
professional.</TE>
<TE>   With the subsequent fall of the Taliban, aid organizations have begun
to pour back into Afghanistan, with the U.S. military vowing to play a
part in relief operations. It is less a case of a sudden
conscientiousness than part of the American strategy to win the hearts
and minds of Afghanistan and the rest of the world's wavering Muslim
population.</TE>
<TE>   For Sadeed, it is the light at the end of the long tunnel she has been
praying for. With ACTED, she makes plans to open a women's primary care
clinic in northern Takhar. She hopes to reopen her clinic in Bamiyan
province, which the Taliban sacked. And if the right situation arose, she
says she would not be averse to playing a role in the country's political
reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   "What I would most like to do is rebuild the Red Crescent of
Afghanistan. My ultimate goal is to see one hospital, one school, one
self-sufficient warehouse for humanitarian emergencies in every village
of my country," she says. As one of the few multiethnic Afghan women
equally at ease among all of her country's various tribes and ethnic
groups--and a woman with a certain newfound notoriety--she seems well
poised for the job.</TE>

<HD>The Man Who Remembered Nothing</HD>
<DH>An Illness Sapped His Memory. A Friendship Helped Him Recover.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GORDON STEEL as told to Dana Harris</AU>
<BD>Gordon Steel is founder and president of The Steel Co. Dana Harris
is a film reporter for Variety and Daily Variety</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a movie called "Memento" that tells the fractured story of
a man who can't recognize his own life; every 15 minutes, his memory is
erased and he must reestablish his world all over again. Critics praised
the film for its unique narrative, but they're wrong. Fourteen years ago,
it could have been my autobiography.</LD>
<LD>   My doctors never figured out exactly how I contracted the disease, but
as best as anyone can tell, I was bitten by a mosquito in 1988 and nearly
died. The diagnosis was viral meningoencephalitis, a severe and often
deadly brain infection. I was in a coma for four days and had a seizure
after the first 48 hours.</LD>
<LD>   When I left the hospital after two weeks, my memory was in the same
state as a credit card after a run-in with a refrigerator magnet. I had
lost the ability to recall anything outside of my own name and that of my
wife and young son. But I was in no position to sit in bed and pore over
flashcards. My wife was six months pregnant. We had no insurance, no
savings. We also would have nowhere to live in a few weeks since we had
just sold our home to buy an expensive new one.</LD>
<TE>   I was a former actor and agent who ran my own business, consulting
international film distributors who valued my knowledge of top producers,
bankers and studio chiefs. With my matchmaking talents reduced to
occasionally remembering where I kept my coffee mug, I was singularly
unsuited for the job.</TE>
<TE>   In case I had any doubt, I made the mistake of allowing one business
associate to see me in the hospital--an Australian distributor whom I
considered a family friend. When he canceled our contract shortly
thereafter, it was easy to extrapolate that letting the industry know I
was ill would have generated outpourings of sympathy and brought an end
to my career.</TE>
<TE>   That would have been fine with my doctors, who told me that work was
out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, I asked my wife if I could try. She agreed, and we signed
for the new house.</TE>
<TE>   I was convinced that the best chance of supporting my family would
come through an old job skill: I would act the role of a successful
Hollywood businessman. The only problem was that I couldn't remember my
lines. I could recall nothing from one minute to the next and was forced
to constantly write down names, places and other details on scraps of
paper, in notebooks, even in the palm of my hand so that the words would
make sense the next time I looked at them. They rarely did.</TE>
<TE>   A day at the office was a nightmarish ride of panic attacks
alternating with utter blankness. Each time the phone rang, my assistant
would have to vamp for time as I desperately rifled through my notes,
hoping to identify the caller. Finally I would pick up, praying that
whoever it was wasn't returning a call--because I didn't remember making
it.</TE>
<TE>   I felt like a detective who was trying to piece his life together even
as it unfolded. Two friends kept me on the trail: my wife and my lawyer.
They allowed me to ignore my doctors' advice while keeping my secret and
preventing anyone else from learning it. My attorney also oversaw my work
to ensure that I served my clients well between memory lapses. I couldn't
remember his name either.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after I got out of the hospital, my business required me to
close a deal with a Japanese company. They told me I could only sign the
contract at the Milan film market. Over the next month, my lawyer tried
to draw the line, telling me that it was madness to even consider the
trip. I had lost 25 pounds and still spent 12 hours a day in bed. It
didn't matter. If I didn't go, there would be no deal. I was going.</TE>
<TE>   Finally he said, "So when and where is this market?"</TE>
<TE>   "Italy, soon," I said, pleased that I could tell him something.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is this company?"</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't remember.</TE>
<TE>   "Fine," he said. "I'm coming with you."</TE>
<TE>   With the excuse that he wanted to go to Italy to buy an Armani jacket
wholesale, he left his firm for a week to fly with me to Milan. Once
there, my attorney posed as my secretary, constantly prompting me on the
names of friends and clients, taking notes and reading contracts, none of
which I was capable of doing myself. As I stood by, glassy-eyed, he said
I was fine, really, just had a touch of the flu. We closed the deal with
the Japanese company. In the end, he didn't even get to buy his jacket;
we were forced to make a hasty exit from the designer's showroom when I
suddenly had to run outside to throw up.</TE>
<TE>   You can never repay someone for helping you regain your world, but I
managed to make a small down payment in 1990. One morning he collapsed in
the lobby of our gym with a massive heart attack, and I drove like hell
to get him to Cedars-Sinai. A week later, he became the recipient of an
emergency heart transplant. If anything, having a heart donor has only
let him experience the same gratitude I have for him.</TE>
<TE>   It has been more than a decade since I was ill. I have rebuilt my
memory and my consulting business thrives. I am thinner than I once was;
so be it. I have my happy ending: My name is Gordon Steel. I have two
sons, James and Andrew. Their godfather is Jerry Edelstein, my best
friend and lawyer. We go to the gym every Saturday.</TE>

<DH>The Notorious Sleepy Lagoon Trial Inspired Alice Greenfield McGrath
to Crusade  for Social Justice. Sixty Years Later, She Shows No Signs of
Stopping.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Frank O. Sotomayor is a Times staff writer and editor</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alice Greenfield McGrath took on her first cause soon after
graduating from Washington High School, raising money for Chinese victims
of Japan's aggression in the late 1930s. She was Alice Greenfield then
and just discovering her passion for social justice. She made plans to
become a union organizer. Then, in the fall of 1942, while she was
recovering from a bout of pleurisy at her Silver Lake home, a friend,
labor attorney George Shibley, dropped by with a sheaf of court
transcripts. That visit--and its aftermath--would last a lifetime. The
attorney had his hands full, defending several Mexican American youths
accused of murder. The body of Jose Diaz had been found Aug. 2, near a
swimming hole in Southeast L.A. County, and some of the accused men had
been in the vicinity the night before. The prosecution's case was
circumstantial at best, but the proceedings were unfolding during the
xenophobic days of World War II: Japanese Americans had already been
ordered to internment camps, and prejudice against Mexican Americans was
widespread. Twenty-two defendants, ages 17 to 21, from a Mexican American
barrio, were tried en masse.</LD>
<LD>   George Shibley needed help--would McGrath be willing to write a
summary of each day's trial proceedings?</LD>
<TE>   She agreed and soon found herself immersed in a trial that gained
notoriety as one of the most racist in local history. The proceedings
propelled McGrath into a lifetime of activism and inspired the play and
film "Zoot Suit."</TE>
<TE>   At 84, she is still working to balance the scales of justice for the
poor. In the last two decades, she helped develop a pro bono legal aid
program in Ventura County for those unable to afford an attorney;
championed a pilot project to reduce the cost of family-law cases for
low-income clients; and made 85 trips to Nicaragua to provide
humanitarian aid.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think that by this time, she'd be weary," says author Studs
Terkel, who has known McGrath for 40 years. "But her passion is
undiminished. She has that hope. She is tireless."</TE>
<TE>   Alice Greenfield knew about bias and being "different." her parents
had fled discrimination against Jews in czarist Russia and had moved to
Canada before settling in southern Los Angeles in 1922. The family stood
out in the WASPy neighborhood: "I was different than everybody else. We
had different food. My mother usually spoke in a different
language--Yiddish--and her English was accented." Being Jewish and the
daughter of immigrants "may explain why it was very easy for me to be
empathetic to people who were also 'the other.' "</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after Shibley's visit, McGrath was well enough to attend
the trial that had become known as the Sleepy Lagoon case. What she saw
appalled her. "It was so much worse when you saw the expression of Judge
[Charles W.] Fricke. He despised the defendants. He insulted Shibley. If
the prosecutor made an incorrect motion, Fricke would rephrase the motion
and grant it."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the trial, a sheriff's official had told a grand jury that
Mexicans had an inbred desire "to kill, or at least, let blood." The
sensationalistic local press advocated a get-tough approach against
Mexican American gang members, known as pachucos. The accused men had
hung out together and were identified loosely as the "38th Street Gang,"
but they were hardly hard-core gang members. Yet newspaper accounts of
the trial labeled them "zoot suit gangsters" in derisive reference to the
attire popular with some of them.</TE>
<TE>   During the three-month trial, Shibley registered his objections that
the defendants were kept at one side of the courtroom and were barred
from consulting with their lawyers. Fricke ignored his complaints. In
January 1943, an all-white jury convicted 17 of the 22 defendants, five
of them for assault. Twelve of the 17 were found guilty of first- or
second-degree murder and were sent to San Quentin penitentiary.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal activists and Hollywood celebrities formed a defense committee
to finance an appeal. Carey McWilliams, who would later become editor of
The Nation magazine, became its national chairman. At first, McGrath ran
mimeograph machines and stuffed envelopes as a volunteer. When McWilliams
offered her the position of committee executive secretary, she hesitated,
worried that she had only a high school diploma and couldn't even type.
"I've never done anything like that before," she told McWilliams.</TE>
<TE>   "And now you will," he shot back.</TE>
<TE>   Pecking away at an Underwood typewriter, McGrath started putting
together "The Appeal News," which was mailed to hundreds of supporters,
including Rita Hayworth and Orson Welles. She was a quick study and
became an expert fund-raiser and speaker, at one time addressing 1,000
longshoremen in a San Francisco union hall. Alice Greenfield had found
her calling.</TE>
<TE>   After the 12 men had served almost two years in jail and prison, the
state Circuit Court of Appeal reversed the convictions. The court cited a
lack of evidence and attacked Fricke's actions. Denying defendants full
access to lawyers was akin to moving forward "with the haste of a mob."
The case became a milestone in protecting defendants' due-process rights
and was a seminal victory for Mexican Americans, politically powerless at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-two years after their release from prison, three of the 12
defendants helped McGrath celebrate her 80th birthday. There, the men
recalled the happy day, Oct. 4, 1944, when they received her telegram:</TE>
<TE>   "Decision reversed. Victory. Will wire details when we have them. Oh
what a beautiful morning. Much love. Alice."</TE>
<TE>   Social activism is frequently a short-lived career, which makes
McGrath's years of work all the more remarkable. Searching for clues to
her longevity, I tour her Ventura hillside home. The range of her causes
is instantly apparent; plaques, commendations and photos hang from walls
everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   When McGrath begins to recount struggles from the past, her dark eyes
sparkle and her hands and long silver earrings move in rhythm with her
words. Years ago, when working to secure legal counsel for poor women in
domestic cases, "I would take home people's stories, really heartbreaking
stories, and would worry about them and feel bad. And then I thought,
'No, You can't do that--you are going to burn yourself out.' "</TE>
<TE>   So during the day, she works hard. And she worries. "After that, I
have to just leave it there."</TE>
<TE>   She sets modest goals. "I work with the hope--but not the
expectation--</TE>
<TE>   of success."</TE>
<TE>   And she is good to herself. At the start of the day, McGrath settles
in bed with her coffee and English muffin to devour Faulkner or another
author. Then she's ready to drive to one of her many volunteer projects.
The end of the day is frequently marked with a nightcap: vodka, straight.</TE>
<TE>   There are other interests. McGrath learned to swim at 65, and goes to
the pool three times weekly for conditioning. She communicates by phone
and e-mail with her daughter, Laura, an attorney in Los Angeles and son,
Daniel, a paralegal in North Dakota. They were born during her first
marriage to businessman Max Schechter.</TE>
<TE>   She met her second husband, poet Thomas McGrath at a political
fund-raiser. During the McCarthy era, Thomas McGrath was not retained as
an instructor at Cal State Los Angeles because he had refused to testify
before a House Un-American Activities panel. With her husband unemployed,
McGrath went to work full time. Independent filmmakers hired her to
arrange shooting locations for "The Savage Eye." Later, she joined the
nearly all-male ranks of sales representatives at Grove Press, a
publishing house.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath learned early how to maintain her focus. One such lesson came
from W. E. B. DuBois, the distinguished African American author. When
McGrath organized a 1954 dinner in DuBois' honor, she also showed the
civil rights leader around town and related a racist-tinged incident that
had occurred in the city. That incident, she exclaimed, had made her
"very angry."</TE>
<TE>   DuBois counseled her: "Your anger is appropriate, Alice. But save your
energy for the work."</TE>
<TE>   And so she did.</TE>
<TE>   When Daniel began self-defense training at age 9, McGrath met his
instructor, Bruce Tegner, whose regimen emphasized self-assurance rather
than aggressiveness. McGrath began taking classes from Tegner and she
soon was helping to run his judo business. Later, they wrote some of the
first paperback books in English on martial arts and established their
Thor Publishing company.</TE>
<TE>   After she and Tom McGrath divorced, Alice lived with Tegner. In 1977
they invited friends to their Ventura home for Alice's 60th birthday and
surprised them with an informal wedding.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath, who has a brown belt for proficiency in judo movements,
despised the image of women as "helpless." So she helped introduce the
teaching of self-defense to women and girls at Ventura College, using the
martial arts discipline to develop self-esteem and assertiveness. After
Tegner died in 1985, she continued operating their publishing business.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath's charisma, conviction and persuasiveness have attracted
hundreds to her causes. Oxnard teacher Amada Irma Perez summarizes their
sentiments: She "has a magic about her."</TE>
<TE>   Mcgrath first traveled to Nicaragua in 1984, eager to experience the
country after Sandinista forces had toppled the long-reigning Somoza
dictatorship. She met some of the Marxist-oriented Sandinista leaders and
soon was taking "political tourists" there.</TE>
<TE>   During one visit, she encountered a Scottish investment banker who had
volunteered to work construction in Nicaragua during his vacation. It
became another calling; she, too, would do what she could to help the
impoverished country. Since then, she has made an average of five visits
a year. Several physicians, including Dr. Greg Stidham of Memphis, were
among her invited guests during a 1993 trip. Their destination was
Children's Hospital of Managua, where scores of Nicaraguan children were
suffering from congenital heart disease and no specialist was available
to perform the delicate surgeries they needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Her contagious affection for Nicaragua and its people were nothing
short of an inspiration for me," Stidham says. Indeed, he has returned to
Managua seven times, accompanied each time by 12 surgeons, nurses and
technicians. They have performed 120 surgeries on children with
congenital heart disease. They also have provided medical equipment and
training.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath's most recent missions to Nicaragua were first contemplated in
the hot tub of the Pierpoint Racket Club in Ventura. One evening, as she
was talking about Nicaragua with others  in the hot tub, Jan Lindsay,
then president of Ventura East Rotary Club, overheard her. "Why don't you
tell our Rotary members about your work?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Thus began an unusual--and successful--collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   Funds from the Ventura East Rotary Club, supplemented by Rotary
International grants, will build housing for Nicaraguans uprooted in 1998
by Hurricane Mitch's devastation. With McGrath's aid, the Rotarians also
have approved $38,000 to aid small coffee farmers and help preserve part
of the Nicaraguan rain forest.</TE>
<TE>   The legal community of Ventura knows of her commitment as well.
McGrath took over day-to-day management of a pro bono program sponsored
by the Ventura County Bar Assn. in 1996, recruiting many attorneys to
offer their services for free. More recently, working with the Mexican
American Bar Assn. of Ventura, McGrath promoted a concept known as
"unbundling." Under this pilot project, a low-income client unable to
hire a lawyer for an entire divorce case can retain an attorney for just
one vital phase--the custody portion, for example.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to work with Alice," says Lindsay. "She gets it done."</TE>
<TE>   more than 30 years after the Sleepy Lagoon case, McGrath's life came
full circle. The trial and its aftermath became art.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Valdez knew that he wanted to write and produce the play that
would become "Zoot Suit," but he needed a "heart line" to make the drama
work. In 1977, McGrath met with the Chicano playwright and provided key
material and insight. "Alice became my link to the events," Valdez says.</TE>
<TE>   "Zoot Suit," loosely based on Sleepy Lagoon and the 1943 Zoot Suit
Riots--a weeklong period during which Mexican American youths were beaten
up by servicemen--became a hit at the Mark Taper Forum in 1978. Rich with
pachuco slang, swinging dance numbers and the acting of Edward James
Olmos, the production moved to the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood, where
it broke attendance records.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath became a celebrity within the Chicano community. I first met
her at one of her appearances as she shuttled from one Mexican American
gathering to another. At her talks, she was always gracious, reminding
listeners that credit for the Sleepy Lagoon victory should focus not on
her, but on the entire defense committee and on Shibley, attorney Ben
Margolis and the other lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   When the play was most recently revived, in Chicago's Goodman Theatre
in the summer of 2000, McGrath was there on opening night. She never
ceases to be moved by the play and the events it portrays. It evokes the
same sense of compassion she first felt at Washington High School.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking about the beneficiaries of her activism, she repeats a
sentiment spoken by the character Alice onstage: "If they lose, I lose.
We all lose. I am not Lady Charity trying to help the Mexicans--I am
doing this for us."</TE>

<HD>In Search of Shampoo</HD>
<DH>Not All Hair Is Created Equal, and Neither Are the Products that
Keep It Healthy</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILLARY JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>Hillary Johnson last wrote for the magazine about glittery makeup</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I wore my hair in an inch-long blond frizz with a few spiky bangs
hanging over my forehead. I showered with nothing but a bottle of Ivory
dish soap in hand, and I usually finished with a handful of goo from some
vat of off-brand, industrial-strength stiffening gel. I didn't worry
about product build-up because I was in the habit of scalping myself
every couple of weeks. Bad hair-care products actually served me well, as
the more damage I did to my '80s college hair, the stiffer on end it
stood.</LD>
<LD>   About the time Boy George went into rehab, I started using real
shampoo. I had a job and could afford it, my hair had gained a length of
three or four inches, and the dish detergent method left it with the
texture of fiberglass insulation. Still, I used whatever shampoo was
lying around--once my uncle, a traveling furniture salesman, gave me a
garbage bag full of miniature hotel shampoos he'd collected on the road,
and I used those for at least a year. When those ran out, I began using
my boyfriend's Head &amp; Shoulders and a very large bottle of Infusium
23--the castor oil of conditioners--from Costco daily. Why? Because they
were there.</LD>
<TE>   Then came the epiphany. One day I procured a free sample of Bumble and
Bumble's Alojoba Shampoo. The difference between Head &amp; Shoulders and
Bumble and Bumble is roughly the difference between digging in a rotten
log for grubs and dining on truffle-laced foie gras at L'Orangerie. I
breathlessly called up Bumble and Bumble to ask them just what kind of
butterfly sweat and elf earwax went into this amazing stuff. "The Alojoba
was developed for virgin damaged hair, so you're my target," product
manager Frederic Pignault said. I had lucked upon the correct formula for
my long, sun-damaged natural blondness--a good thing, since Pignault said
half the battle is in getting the right shampoo for your hair.</TE>
<TE>   If I'd had color-treated hair, he explained, I would have needed the
Gentle Shampoo. Fine, limp hair, and I would have needed the Thickening
Shampoo. (I know he's right, because I tried the Thickening Shampoo just
to test him, and it gave my hair a slightly funny texture.)</TE>
<TE>   The Alojoba, which sells for $16 a bottle, contains common shampoo
ingredients: aloe and jojoba. "A lot of people claim these ingredients,
and they can because they're in there, but not enough to see the effects.
The problem has always been that if you put too much of them in, they
sink to the bottom of the bottle. We created a base that could hold these
ingredients at a higher level," Pignault explained.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the good news: having found your perfect shampoo, you never
have to change. "Hair getting 'tired' of a shampoo, that is a myth,"
Pignault said. I asked him about the effectiveness of my Costco
conditioner. "I call those conditioners the tricky quick fix," he said.
"The consumer gets an instant result. When you touch your hair, you're
going to get a soft feel, but that's just a coating. It's like painting a
wall that has rot on the inside. It looks good at first, but the rot will
eventually show through." That would be bad, should I ever want to have
my hair appraised. I probably won't, but I'd still better lose the Costco
vat.</TE>
<TE>   However, if I were to go for the quality of hair that cries out to be
insured by Lloyd's of London, I'd probably have to see Laurent D., who
takes care of Uma Thurman's golden locks at his Prive salon on Beverly
Boulevard. There he has introduced his own line of Prive "formule aux
herbes" products. Laurent is a jolly elf of a Frenchman. "I just came
back from doing the runway shows, and you're going to see lots of sexy
hair!" he exclaims. "We're going back to lots of curls. Even straight
hair has body, movement. For this it must be in very good condition. But
not too much heavy conditioner--it's like making a souffle."</TE>
<TE>   Laurent is an unabashed sensualist. For him, scent and texture are the
most important elements of a good shampoo. "It's like clothes," he says.
"You pay a lot for the best fabric." Laurent's formulas start with an
aqueous blend of rosemary, sage, white ginger, nettle and clove. The
orchid and aloe perfume of Prive's Reparative shampoo is so overpowering
that you risk getting lightheaded on the fumes. (Best to lather up lying
down in the bathtub to let your hair steep for a good long time.) And the
Prive products are surprisingly generous in portion: A 500-milliliter
apothecary bottle costs $24 and will last several months.</TE>
<TE>   By this time I was determined to try every exotic shampoo I could get
my hands on. The Japanese have Sayuri, a shampoo and conditioner
containing Camellia Oil, the ingredient historically favored by the
geishas of Japan. For the heroine of Arthur Golden's "Memoirs of a
Geisha," whose name is also Sayuri, a young geisha's first shampoo was
not the luxurious scalp massage we like to imagine, but a brutal,
scalp-reddening ordeal endured as a rite of passage. The Sayuri shampoo,
however, is not at all painful to use, and for straight, heavy Asian
hair, this is reputedly the stuff. Camellias, one of the main
ingredients, are an odorless flower, and the hair products are almost
without scent--a welcome characteristic when you don't want your hair
competing with your Chanel No. 5. The French company Phytologie has an
extensive botanical product line with a cult-like following. Phytologie
uses plant extracts as the source of their ingredients instead of the
cheaper, more plentiful synthetic compounds most other companies use.
Their Phytocypres Exfoliating Shampoo comes in a glass bottle to better
preserve its contents, which include weeping willow, a rich natural
source of salicylic acid and an ingredient in many dandruff shampoos.
This stuff soothes the scalp and leaves behind a cypress scent that is
both reassuringly medicinal and exotic.</TE>
<TE>   Phytologie also has a line called Phyto Plage--or beachwear for the
hair. The Sun Shampoo lathers up even in saltwater. This is essential
beach gear for California sun-bunnies who wish to remain succulent
throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   Swimmers can benefit from Paul Labrecque Clearly Silk After Swim
Shampoo, with ingredients that break down the residues left behind by
chlorine (you can also wash your bikini in it!). And curly haired folk
even have their own product line, Ouidad, which has its own curly
hair-care Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Leonor Greyl, or what I like to think of as the Holy
Greyl of shampoos. Greyl's American ambassador, Madeline Johnson, says
that even in France, where hair care is a "lifestyle," Leonor Greyl is
the balm to end all others--a magical ointment so potent that, in large
enough quantities, it could probably revive the dead. Not that any mortal
could afford large quantities of this stuff. Twenty-five dollars for a
modest tube of shampoo? And $38 for a mere 200 milliliters of
conditioner?</TE>
<TE>   Here's the bad news: It's worth it. Their Creme Moelle de Bambou
shampoo is more of a velvety cream custard filling than a shampoo. This
unctuous semi-liquid didn't even foam up when I massaged it into my head.
"It contains no sodium lauryl sulfate, which is the surfactant in
drugstore shampoo," Johnson says. "So you don't get what I call the
'Suave lather effect' that just roughs up the cuticle. But you have to
get used to it." Instead, the stuff just bathed my head like warm butter,
then rinsed out clean and slick. Afterward, even blown dry, my hair was
so moist and fluid that touching it was like dipping your fingers into a
stream of falling water.</TE>
<TE>   At my insistence, my boyfriend has given up his Head &amp; Shoulders, to
which his hair had likely become "addicted." According to Bumble and
Bumble's Pignault, it can take two or three weeks for hair to detox and
your scalp to rebound from bad shampoo, and the recovery process is a lot
like eliminating sugar from one's diet. While "bad" shampoo is not always
synonymous with cheap, most low-end shampoos contain harsher detergents,
such as sodium lauryl sulfate, which can strip the hair of its natural
oils. (If your budget lacks body, look for one that uses the milder
sodium laureth sulfate instead.) I now have my boyfriend on a steady
ration of Bumble and Bumble's particularly expensive, scalp-friendly
Tonic Shampoo, which has tea tree oil as its main active ingredient--and
a lot of tea tree oil, which is a pricey ingredient. It's costing me, but
after all, I'm the one who has to run my fingers through his hair.</TE>
<TE>   Every once in a while I have to stop and ask myself what could be more
ridiculous than a $25 bottle of shampoo? (Maybe a $10 pack of chewing
gum, though as far as I know, there is no such thing.) But let me put it
this way. I drive a pickup truck and wear a Casio wristwatch, but my hair
is as soft as mist and as shiny as molten gold, and it smells like a
million bucks.</TE>

<DH>Miles and Miles Later, a Caffeine Addict Finds the Ultimate
Afternoon Snack</DH>

<BD>Northern California-based James McNair is the author of 40
cookbooks, the latest of which is "Afternoon Delights" (Chronicle Books,
2001)</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every afternoon, caffeine connoisseurs across America trek to their
favorite coffeehouses or bakery-cafes for a steamy or frosty concoction
to revive their senses and carry them through the rest of the day. My
partner, Andrew Moore, and I frequently join this throng to get our fix.
And like many of our fellow patrons, we are often interested in a
tantalizing treat to go along with a frothy caffe latte or spicy chai.</LD>
<LD>   During our travels from coast to coast, we have made it our habit to
seek out great emporiums of coffee and tea to sample their fare. One
afternoon, while enjoying crisp biscotti dipped into cups of steaming
espresso, it occurred to us that here was the perfect material for a
cookbook. So, while sipping and nibbling in both the ubiquitous national
chains and unique local establishments, we started to keep notes of
popular baked offerings.</LD>
<LD>   Tasting our way through the country may sound like a dream job, and at
times it was. Sighs of delight accompanied our bites into the occasional
perfect buttery shortbreads and gooey pecan bars. More often than not,
however, we would encounter yet another bone-dry scone, soggy lemon bar,
stale brownie, underbaked cookie or bland coffee cake. Of course, we knew
that some of the problems came from their being sold beyond their optimum
shelf life. But given the typically high prices, they should all have
been of premium quality and served as fresh as possible.</LD>
<TE>   Armed with a list of our 25 favorite coffeehouse treats, we decided to
make our own coffeehouse treats, and at a fraction of the cost of
commercial versions. Mountains of flour, sugar and butter later, we
affirmed our belief that few commercial products come close to the
quality of baked goods fresh from the home oven.</TE>
<TE>   Our collection of recipes for cookies, brownies, bars, scones, quick
breads and coffee cakes makes large-size treats designed for adult
appetites, but bakers who prefer smaller versions can follow
size-reduction tips. While we urge eating most treats the day they are
baked, quick breads, biscotti and shortbreads store well, making them
ideal candidates for gifting or keeping on hand for impromptu coffee
chats.</TE>
<TE>   Although we prefer our own home-baked treats, a great coffeehouse or
bakery-cafe is a neighborhood treasure, and we still love to while away
an afternoon at one whenever we can. We also appreciate them as perfect
casual gathering places to meet friends and colleagues. And we thank them
for their sweet inspirations.</TE>
<TE>Coconut Macaroons</TE>
<TE>   (Adapted from "Afternoon Delights," by James McNair and Andrew Moore)</TE>
<TE>   Makes 1 dozen large cookies</TE>
<TE>   14 ounces sweetened shredded coconut, about 4 cups</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 cup egg whites (from about 8 large eggs)</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup all-purpose flour</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Line a baking sheet with kitchen parchment and set aside. In a heavy
saucepan, combine all of the ingredients and mix thoroughly. Place over
medium heat and cook, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the
pan to prevent scorching, until the mixture is fairly dry and stiff,
about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</TE>
<TE>   Using a #20 (1/4-cup) ice-cream scoop with a release mechanism, scoop
up level portions of the mixture and place them about 1 inch apart on the
lined baking sheet. Transfer baking sheet to a 350-degree oven and bake
until the macaroons are golden brown, about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes,
then peel the macaroons from the parchment and place directly on the rack
to cool completely. (Macaroons may be stored in an airtight container at
room temperature for  up to 3 days.)</TE>

<HD>A New Game Plan</HD>
<DH>Saddle Peak's Updated Menu (Venison, Buffalo, Elk) Has Never Tasted
Better</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At Saddle Peak Lodge in Calabasas, I cut into a medallion of elk:
It's butter-tender, yet lean, with an elusive, delicate flavor that
matches the Burgundy I'm drinking nuance for nuance. With no heavy sauce
to mask its flavor, it's set off by a raft of roasted salsify wrapped in
apple-smoked bacon. Lost in the conversation, the food and the wine, I
look up and catch the eye of a regal elk surveying the scene from high on
the wall. It's disconcerting, this gallery of stuffed beasts--moose, elk,
caribou, deer, even a shaggy bison. I'm not unaware of the irony.</LD>
<LD>   Saddle Peak Lodge began life as a one-room cabin high in the Santa
Monica Mountains. It was later a general store, then in the '20s became a
roadhouse frequented by movie cowboys filming on nearby studio ranches.
It eventually evolved into a rustic stone and timber hunting lodge
specializing in game. Just five miles from Pepperdine University in
Malibu, the historic lodge may not be as remote as it once was, but a
drive up the winding canyon road still feels like a trek. Suddenly, at
the end of a lonely, dark road is a turn, and there, lights blazing, is
the parking lot jammed with vehicles. Stretch limos hum, waiting for
their passengers to emerge from a leisurely dinner, and the air carries
the scent of wood smoke and pine.</LD>
<TE>   Chefs have come and gone at Saddle Peak through the years without
making much impact on the rather staid, old-fashioned game menu. Most,
including Josie LeBalch, who did two stints as chef here before opening
Josie's, were allowed their nightly specials, but not much else. Now
management has finally seen the light. Owner Ann Ehringer and managing
partner Gerhard Tratter brought in Warren Schwartz as chef. The former
Patina sous chef has been allowed to write his own menu. The result is
that the food has never tasted or looked better. And under Tratter,
Patina's former director of operations, the service is now crisp and
professional for the first time, making dining at Saddle Peak a pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   The game theme once seemed almost a gimmick, like the decor, but I've
come to love the atmosphere. Is there a more welcoming bar than Saddle
Peak's, with its fireplace always blazing, even in summer, and a bowl of
red apples set out for munching? Fishing poles lean against the wall, and
well-thumbed books are disposed haphazardly on shelves above the windows.
And the trophies of bygone hunting expeditions, the magnificent moose,
elk and deer that at first seemed startling, are now like friendly
mascots.</TE>
<TE>   Some menu descriptions make dishes sound more belabored than they are.
Buffalo tartare with whole-grain mustard and "unusual" condiments, for
example, seems dubious. But it's unusually interesting. A small cake of
hand-chopped buffalo meat, leaner and somehow lighter than beef, is
flanked by mustardy aioli and discrete piles of capers, chopped egg, red
onion and so on for mixing with a raw quail's egg. Oddly, though, it
comes without toast. A subtle butternut squash soup is embellished,
Austrian-style, with a lashing of iridescent pumpkin seed oil and toasted
pumpkin seeds. Sauteed wild mushrooms in a beautifully dusky sauce anchor
a fluffy triangle of puff pastry, providing a wonderful first course for
a Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz's sauces are light and on the mark, tailored to each dish.
One night we nab the last order of the special--wild partridge in a
marvelously subtle sauce emulsified with foie gras, which plays
beautifully against the wild partridge meat. Like all game, it's lean and
has a tendency to be dry, but I liked its slight funkiness.</TE>
<TE>   With elk or a gorgeous piece of venison, Schwartz has the confidence
to let the game speak for itself, with the sauce on the side. A creamy
wild mushroom sauce enhances the elk. And the rack of venison, presented
as two long-boned chops, cooked blood rare, gets a silky red wine
reduction.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz is into unusual vegetables, too. Venison comes with brussels
sprouts and mashed parsnips, with a few slices of Fuyu persimmon for
contrast, and the elk with Jerusalem artichokes.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, some diners aren't as enamored of game as others. The chef
has solved that nicely with a respectable Liberty duck breast or, even
more mainstream, a grilled Black Angus steak. The filet is paired with
caramelized Maui onions and a terrific potato galette. However, the night
I tried it, the steak is so tender, or tenderized, that it was somewhat
mushy. Saddle Peak always offers a couple of fish dishes, too.</TE>
<TE>   Less successful are the homemade ravioli stuffed with butternut squash
in brown sage butter: The plate of pasta is simply too rich and greasy.
And a farm-raised pheasant breast is dry and so muted that it registers
at the bottom of the flavor scale.</TE>
<TE>   Each season Schwartz designs a tasting menu. Winter's begins with two
plump sea scallops, seared just on one side. The rabbit is too dry, but
buffalo "on the range" cooked rare is a compelling argument for the
frontier meat. Beautifully lean, with a clean flavor, it could be the
coming thing now that media magnate Ted Turner, who has the largest herd
of bison in America, is opening a restaurant chain featuring 25 versions
of the bison burger.</TE>
<TE>   Saddle Peak has updated the pastry selection as well. That tasting
menu ended with a lovely individual Meyer lemon tart topped with a cloud
of softly whipped, unsweetened cream strewn with lemon peel. There's a
creamy and cold lavender creme brulee, and sometimes a warm strawberry
tart with black pepper and a balsamic reduction. Not so strange at all,
Italians like to eat strawberries with a few drops of aged aceto
balsamico.</TE>
<TE>   It's heartening to see a classic L.A. restaurant renewed. This is one
well worth the detour. Just remember the way home.</TE>

<HD>Alarm Is a Key to Survival</HD>
<DH>Safety: Homes with nonfunctioning smoke detectors, like the
one in Placentia where four died last week, account for most deaths
from residential fires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As investigators searched the ruins of the Placentia home where a
fire killed four members of the Ybarra family last week, one finding
came as no surprise: a disconnected smoke detector.</LD>
<LD>   Like tens of thousands of other Americans, the Ybarras had taken
down their broken alarm and had never gotten around to replacing it.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze killed Donald Ybarra and his three young sons--Brandon,
Connor and Jacob. Neighbors said that by the time they were alerted,
the house was engulfed. Only Ybarra's wife, who dashed outside as her
husband ran upstairs in a futile effort to save his sons, survived.</LD>
<TE>   A working smoke detector, officials and neighbors agreed, might
have made a difference.</TE>
<TE>   Federal statistics show that one in five homes have nonfunctioning
smoke detectors. These homes, along with the small number where
detectors have never been installed, account for nearly 80% of deaths
from residential fires.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Stephen J. Miller, spokesman for the Orange County Fire
Authority, said working fire alarms were missing in every house fire
he has seen where people died.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters and safety experts have heard all the reasons people
dislike--and disconnect--smoke detectors: burning toast, the dryer, a
steamy shower all set off the irritating squeal. The batteries run
down--more irritating beeps--and are a hassle to replace. The
detectors are a pain to install.</TE>
<TE>   After decades of declining fire deaths because of smoke alarms,
the number of lives saved is starting to level off. Researchers say
that to save more lives, they need to find ways to get people to stop
disconnecting their smoke detectors. Stricter laws, public service
announcements and even door-to-door educational efforts can only do
so much.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are looking toward technology.</TE>
<TE>   At a federal laboratory in Maryland, researchers are studying how
to create the ideal smoke detector: an alarm that would sound when
there is a fire, not when toast is overcooked.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is all the 'nuisance' alarms," said William
Grosshandler, chief of fire research at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology. "If we could cut down on those, people
would stop interfering with the smoke detectors."</TE>
<TE>   There are no industry standards aimed at minimizing false alarms.
Product testers do not give higher marks to detectors that go off
only when there are fires.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, products are tested only to make sure they sound when
there is a fire, not that they keep quiet when there isn't one.</TE>
<TE>   Grosshandler and others say the technology to cut down on the
nuisance factor exists--it just needs to be perfected. And if it can
be fine-tuned to the point where there is only one nuisance alarm,
instead of several, for every actual fire, fire departments might
consider having home alarms send a signal to firehouses directly.</TE>
<TE>   "Fire departments aren't interested in doing that with the current
technology because they don't have the resources to respond to all
the false alarms," Grosshandler said. "But if we can develop an alarm
certified against nuisance sources, then it becomes possible. The
firetrucks could roll as soon as an alarm goes off."</TE>
<TE>   And people won't keep taking down their detectors because they're
annoyed by all the unnecessary alarms.</TE>
<TE>   The airline industry is a driving force behind the research, which
is being funded by industry and government grants. Commercial planes
are plagued by nuisance alarms in their cargo areas. Federal aviation
rules require that they land at the nearest airport as soon as an
alarm goes off.</TE>
<TE>   "It creates a safety problem if they have to make 100 emergency
landings for every real fire," Grosshandler said.</TE>
<TE>   Some safety officials say existing technology could reduce
nuisance alarms in the home--it's just a matter of getting consumers
to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Battery-powered alarms that sell in the $60 range offer
temperature gauges and carbon monoxide detectors and combine laser
and radiation technology. They can be adjusted to be less sensitive
to smoke when installed in the kitchen and more sensitive in
bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Lithium batteries in the higher-priced alarms last 10 years, which
eliminates the complaint that batteries run down too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, safety experts say, is that the high-tech models are
often passed over for less sophisticated devices that cost about $10.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say
one easy solution is to require all new homes to be built with
"hard-wired" alarms with battery backups that can't be dismantled.
All Orange County cities have such a law in place. Placentia, where
the Ybarras lived, also mandates that all new homes have sprinklers.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is you can't enforce those standards on older homes,"
said Kim Blindauer, a CDC epidemiologist. The Ybarra house was built
30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A 1997 survey conducted by the National Fire Protection Assn., a
Massachusetts-based nonprofit group, offers insight into why so many
homeowners leave their battery-operated fire alarms disconnected for
so long: Most people think they're at minimal risk of a house fire.
And nearly half of those surveyed believe that they would have more
than 10 minutes to safely get out of the house should a fire start in
the living room.</TE>
<TE>   The reality, according to the association, is that a fire can kill
everyone in a house within two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "When the smoke alarms don't work in a house, the risk of someone
in it dying increases by up to 50%," Blindauer said. "People need to
keep their alarms up and working."</TE>

<DH>Crime: Shooting of two brothers inside a car outside a
Santa Ana restaurant puzzles investigators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Javier and Salvador Parra were brothers who lived together and worked
together, sending what money they could home to their families in
Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday night, the brothers died together, the victims of a
puzzling shooting outside a Santa Ana restaurant where they'd worked
for more than three years.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the killings outside a Hometown Buffet were not
related to gangs or drugs, a common motive for many of Santa Ana's
street shootings. Co-workers said robbery does not appear to be a
motive either since neither man's wallet was taken.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a mystery at this point," said Santa Ana Police Sgt. Richard
Bouchard.</TE>
<TE>   Javier, 36, a dishwasher, and Salvador, 32, a cook, had just left
work when they were shot while seated in a car in the restaurant
parking lot at 17th Street and East Lincoln Avenue just before 11
p.m., employees said. Their Ford Mustang, still in drive, coasted
through the parking lot and crashed into a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police they heard several gunshots and then saw a
gunman running from the parking lot. No arrests have been made and
police have not determined a motive, Bouchard said.</TE>
<TE>   Hometown Buffet corporate officials sent counselors to meet with
employees, who described their co-workers as quiet and hard-working.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the best neighborhoods in Santa Ana. Never in my
wildest dreams did I think anything like this could happen here,"
said Garrick Arostique, who had worked with the Parra brothers for
more than two years. "It really turns your stomach. I had just talked
to them before I left last night."</TE>
<TE>   Mario Lee, regional vice president of Buffets Inc., parent to 400
Hometown Buffets in the United States, said the crime was hard to
fathom.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew it wasn't a robbery right off the bat. So it is puzzling,
especially because of the behavior of these two guys. They were model
citizens, very hard-working," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee said police told restaurant officials that nothing was stolen
from the brothers. Police, though, could not confirm that Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers were married and had children. Their wives were in
Tijuana on Saturday and were planning to drive to Orange County today
to make funeral arrangements, said Ray Tavakoli, a district manager
for the restaurant company.</TE>
<TE>   The Parra brothers had worked at the restaurant since it opened
more than three years ago, Tavakoli said.</TE>
<TE>   "We treat our employees like a family," Tavakoli said. "This was a
family tragedy for us."</TE>

<HD>A City-in-Waiting for High School</HD>
<DH>Education: San Juan Capistrano has been hungry for that
unified feeling since its last campus closed in 1963.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Juan Capistrano prides itself on its small-town feel, its
equestrian lifestyle and its 200-year old mission. But for nearly
four decades, it's lacked a key piece of Americana: a hometown high
school.</LD>
<LD>   Capistrano Union High closed in 1963, antiquated and undersized.
The old campus is now a continuation school, and the school's playing
fields--once the site of Friday night football games with rivals such
as Laguna Beach and Tustin--have fallen into disrepair.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the things that really makes a community is a high school,
somebody to cheer for and a homecoming parade," said Phil Schwartze,
a longtime resident and a former mayor of San Juan Capistrano. "It's
a missing link here."</LD>
<TE>   Because of shifting school boundaries and open enrollment,
Schwartze's four sons attended three high schools in all--Dana Hills,
Capistrano Valley and San Clemente, each in a different city.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many stories like mine," Schwartze said. "People are
stuck with wearing all sorts of different colors when it comes to
football season."</TE>
<TE>   But such confusion over school loyalty should draw to a close when
San Juan Hills High opens, a state-of-the-art campus that will unify
the town's public high school students. The school, expected to open
in fall 2005, will be near Ortega Highway, next to the planned
development of Whispering Hills and near the Oaks Blenheim Rancho
Mission Viejo Riding Park.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of San Juan Hills High, being financed in part by a
$65-million school bond approved in 1999, will help the school
district solve a more pressing problem than school pride: crowding.</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Unified School District officials say their five high
schools--Dana Hills, Aliso Niguel, San Clemente, Tesoro and
Capistrano Valley--are bursting at the seams. Each has an enrollment
of roughly 2,500 to 3,000, more than they were designed to handle. If
San Juan Hills opens on schedule, and with coming attendance boundary
changes, enrollment at each of the other schools would drop to a more
manageable 2,200.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,600 San Juan Capistrano students would attend San Juan
Hills. Most of the other students would come from new communities
outside the city, such as Ladera Ranch and Talega.</TE>
<TE>   "Our children are much better served with smaller schools,"
Superintendent Jim Fleming said. "We think 3,000 is too much. The
kids get lost."</TE>
<TE>   Six elementary and middle schools will be built in Capistrano
Unified by the time San Juan Hills opens. By then, boundaries will be
redrawn for many schools in the district, which, at 200 square miles,
is one of the state's largest in area.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano lies smack in the middle of the district, but
the town is carved up like a pie--some students attend high school in
Dana Point, some in San Clemente and others in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Lobo remembers when most San Juan Capistrano students could
walk to the town's high school, which was just around the corner from
the historic mission. Lobo, who still lives near the old high school,
graduated in 1962, the year before the school closed.</TE>
<TE>   When the school closed, students had to drive or take the bus to
campuses in neighboring towns. Lobo's son attended Capistrano Valley
in Mission Viejo, a 10-mile round-trip from San Juan Capistrano.
Others sent their children to one of three private high schools
within city limits: St. Margaret's, Capistrano Valley Christian and
Saddleback Valley Christian.</TE>
<TE>   District officials began looking for a new high school site more
than a decade ago, but the pickings were limited. In 1999, about the
time the school bond passed, officials found a suitable piece of
property about a mile from the equestrian center on La Pata Road.</TE>
<TE>   To the south and west is open land that eventually will be carved
into Whispering Hills, a 193-home housing tract. Future residents of
Whispering Hills, and those who live in nearby Talega and Ladera
Ranch, will be assessed to help pay for the new school.</TE>
<TE>   District officials expect construction to begin in 2003.
Preliminary plans show a design similar to that of a small college
campus. Each building would open onto a central courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to create the idea of a school within a school," said
Austin Buffum, the district's deputy superintendent. "We're hoping to
create clusters of 200 to 300 students per building so we can create
closer relationships with students, teachers and administrators."</TE>
<TE>   The school's specialty will be its performing arts complex, with a
650-seat amphitheater, an orchestra pit, catwalks, and dance, drama
and video editing studios.</TE>
<TE>   Those plans were borrowed from the proposed Orange County High
School for the Arts in Los Alamitos, which was never built.</TE>
<TE>   But athletics will not be left behind. The campus will have two
gymnasiums, an aquatic center, tennis courts, a track, and fields for
soccer, softball and football.</TE>
<TE>   Lobo, who remembers her old school cheer--"Blue and white! Go
team, fight!"--is among those looking forward to the new school.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to give the kids something to be proud of," she said.
"When they win, they don't just win for themselves, but for the moms
and dads and for the city."</TE>

<HD>Home Prices Still Climbing</HD>
<DH>Real estate: In Oak Park, typical house gains $51,000 in
value. Other bedroom communities also post gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cradled in a valley of privilege, the tiny Oak Park community gained
most from Ventura County's sharp run-up in home prices last year.
Down the Conejo Grade, central Camarillo benefited least.</LD>
<LD>   An analysis of home sales in 2001 shows that 15,000-resident Oak
Park continued to lure Los Angeles' disenchanted to such a degree
that the value of a typical home jumped $51,000 in a single year.</LD>
<LD>   Fifteen miles away, the older suburban tract houses that are the
heart of old Camarillo showed a less enduring allure. There, the
price of houses and condos remained flat for the last 12 months.</LD>
<TE>   From the farm worker flats of Piru to the white palaces of funky
Box Canyon, the homeowners who make up two-thirds of Ventura County
households prospered through equity gains averaging $19,000 in 2001,
while the overall economy struggled with a national recession.</TE>
<TE>   A study of 16,426 house and condominium sales broken down by ZIP
Codes shows that Oak Park's stunning one-year gain was followed by
price spikes of at least $31,000 in Newbury Park, Ojai, Moorpark and
eastern Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Oak Park lawyer Diana Fields, 42, was a beneficiary: After
arriving from West Hollywood four years ago, she sold the new
hillside house she had bought in 1998 for a tidy $200,000 profit and
purchased a bigger house in Oak Park's last subdivision for about
$700,000 in August.</TE>
<TE>   "My Lamaze teacher told us there was this great little community
in Ventura County that nobody knows about with great schools and
clean air," said Fields, as a nanny escorted Fields' two young
children around the block in a pink electric Barbie car.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to get out of the city," Fields added. "And it was the
best thing we ever did. The people around here are very open. There
are about 40 kids on every street. And the parents are so involved in
the schools."</TE>
<TE>   The new figures reemphasize the powerful draw of Oak Park's
nationally honored schools and its proximity to Los Angeles for
professionals who want to work in the city but live in a small town
that is safe, clean and friendly.</TE>
<TE>   Just a short hike from a national recreation area, Oak Park abuts
Agoura Hills in Los Angeles County. It has been built mostly in the
last 15 years, first on the valley floor, then in the surrounding
hills.</TE>
<TE>   Relocation specialists--armed with maps showing commuting times,
earthquake faults and air pollution levels--often recommend Oak Park
and nearby Thousand Oaks to white-collar newcomers who work in Los
Angeles. Not that the message hasn't gotten out by word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Auto industry consultant Dean Benjamin, 43, of Marina del Rey was
shopping the community last week, stopping at the model homes in the
luxury development, Chambord, where houses sell from mid-$600,000 to
$885,000. When the subdivision opened two years ago, home prices were
about $200,000 less.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife and I are like a lot of people we know," Benjamin said.
"We want to get a little bit out of the city, but still be close to
everything. Plus the beaches are still close by and I can get to
Santa Monica without taking the freeways."</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agent Bruce Kurnik, 42, and wife Elizabeth left the
San Fernando Valley to buy in Oak Park's Regency Hills estates 2 1/2
years ago because of the schools and the community's family
orientation.</TE>
<TE>   In Encino, the three Kurnik children had to make appointments with
friends for play days, since they all went to private schools and
were shuttled around town after classes let out.</TE>
<TE>   "When we moved out here, [daughter] Maddi said, 'Do kids really do
this?,'" Elizabeth Kurnik said. The 5-year-old was struck by the
number of kids riding scooters down sidewalks and playing in the
street. "On the cul de sac up the hill, there are over 50 kids."</TE>
<TE>   As a real estate professional, Kurnik measures his family's move
in financial terms, as well. "The equity appreciation has been much
better out here," he said. "And the community is better hands down."</TE>
<TE>   The Kurniks bought their 3,600-square-foot house for $619,000 in
1999, and the one next door is for sale for $819,000.</TE>
<TE>   The stream of buyers Kurnik sees in his office are mostly families
from the San Fernando Valley, he said. "I grew up in Tarzana,"
Elizabeth Kurnik said. "I would never go back."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Ventura County home sales were the highest since 1988,
and the county's 7.2% sales increase from 2000 was the second largest
in Southern California. The $19,000 bump in median sales price was
also high.</TE>
<TE>   But the county's hot real estate market was hottest in the
white-collar commuter cities of the east county.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the county's second greatest gain in prices occurred in
Newbury Park, where the upscale Dos Vientos project fueled a $38,000
increase and an 11% hike in sales.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks led the county with 3,264 dwelling sales, while a
second east county city, more affordable Simi Valley, had 3,153
sales. That compares with 2,730 in Oxnard, the county's largest city,
and 1,934 in growth-constricted Ventura, which had far fewer new
houses to sell.</TE>
<TE>   The west county market was generally strong, too. In Oxnard,
workers from pricey Santa Barbara began buying more homes in Oxnard
and Ventura in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   And the Santa Clara Valley farm towns of Fillmore and Santa Paula
finally experienced a sales boom, as a housing shortage sent workers
from the coastal plain inland seeking a house they could afford.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore's sales jump of 45% led the county, and the price of a
typical home jumped more than $22,000. Santa Paula had 24% more
sales, and home prices were up $19,000. A house could still be bought
in either city for about $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Left out of this relative good fortune was Camarillo's aging core.</TE>
<TE>   There, three-bedroom, two-bath houses in neighborhoods built in
the 1960s and 1970s still typically sold for $290,000. But they
gained nothing in value last year, if the median price of the 770
houses that sold in 2001 is an accurate gauge.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of older inventory in that area, and people want
new," said Elaine Pettersen, owner of Hacienda Realty in Camarillo.
"Neighborhoods go through these cycles: They're new and fabulous,
then they begin a period of decline. But when we run out of new
homes, there will be a renaissance period, and they will come back."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem for central Camarillo is that new homes of
every type are available in the popular Mission Oaks and Santa Rosa
Valley area on the city's east end.</TE>
<TE>   "The schools are good, and young families are attracted to homes
there," Pettersen said.</TE>
<TE>   Before Diana Clark moved from Torrance to central Camarillo last
summer, she twice tried to buy in Mission Oaks, too, but lost both
bids. She finally settled for a $370,000, four-bedroom house built in
1978.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get the house we wanted, but we put money into it, and
it all worked out for the best," said Clark, snuggling her 4-year-old
daughter, MaKenna, as they played on a blanket at Charter Oaks Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I fell in love with Camarillo," she said. "I pushed it. The
schools are good. And it looks like a place I could stay forever."</TE>
<TE>   Nor has real estate in central Camarillo been a bad investment
when considered over the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Cara Voligny paid $245,500 when she bought in 1998, and sold for
$355,000 last week after dropping her price from $385,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we'd get more," she said. "But with Sept. 11 and the
holidays, it was real slow at first."</TE>
<TE>   Voligny and her husband, Douglas, a defense industry engineer,
have bought a house on half an acre up the hill in Camarillo Heights
for $580,000. And they're counting on a continuing real estate boom.</TE>
<TE>   "With the university going in, we feel this is going to be a real
growth spurt and we should get in right now before the big push."</TE>
<TE>   It's that kind of belief that has made housing the best investment
in the nation for the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts, however, say they fear housing prices have soared
too high and a fall may be around the corner. They have already seen
some softening in the market.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a seller's market out there anymore," Pettersen said.
"The sellers don't get it yet. They're still thinking it's the same
as a year ago. But the buyers understand. They're really taking their
time. And they're coming in with low-ball offers."</TE>

<HD>Sky's the Limit for Amateur Stargazers</HD>
<DH>Astronomy: Society grows in membership, clout as it reaches
its 45th anniversary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stargazer Dave Holland can be pretty hard-core about his hobby. He
thinks it's no big deal to lug 300 pounds of telescopes and equipment
to chilly mountaintops to determine which of Jupiter's shifting moons
might be rounding the giant planet on any given night.</LD>
<LD>   His personal library contains about four dozen books about
astronomy, and he subscribes to two monthly astronomy magazines.</LD>
<LD>   The 40-year-old once spent two weeks on a 2,000-mile, round-trip
pilgrimage to the tip of Baja California to watch a total solar
eclipse that lasted about 61/2 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Such fervor is common among members of the Ventura County
Astronomical Society, which is marking its 45th anniversary this
year. From a handful of hobbyists in 1957, the group has grown to 150
and it sponsors educational programs for local students in addition
to lobbying developers to reduce so-called light pollution.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the society lobbied the developer of a 20,000-home
project near Mt. Pinos to use more efficient outdoor lights that
don't obscure the night sky. The developer agreed in principle.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first real big design win," said society President
Mike Chibnik of Simi Valley, adding that it didn't hurt that the
appeal for light conservation came in the middle of a statewide
energy crisis. "Electricity is something that you don't want to throw
away."</TE>
<TE>   Holland, a stock clerk for an electronics firm, volunteers as a
teacher's aide for Moorpark College astronomy classes. He said he has
seen most everything an amateur can see in the night sky--from
planets and moons to nebulae and comets. But he continues to search
the heavens.</TE>
<TE>   "Even now, I always find something new," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Holland joined the astronomical society after his parents gave him
a telescope for his 15th birthday. When he peered into the night and
saw the rings of Saturn, he was hooked. "That was so cool to see that
for the first time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Holland dived into his new hobby. "I learned the sky by physically
reading the books, physically memorizing the star charts," he said.
"I like hunting for the object as much as actually finding it."</TE>
<TE>   Holland, who edits the society's newsletter, now owns five
telescopes and has had dozens of his celestial photographs published.</TE>
<TE>   He and other society members regularly take their equipment to
local schools to give kids--and sometimes adults--their first
close-up look at the planets.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, that's a thrill," he said. "I've been doing it for so
long that sometimes I take it for granted that everyone's looked
through a telescope."</TE>
<TE>   The astronomical society meets a few times a month to learn about
stars, photograph distant objects or view star clusters during a new
moon, when visibility is better. The society, which also has a youth
division, typically meets the third Friday of the month with a
presentation at Moorpark College.</TE>
<TE>   A guest lecturer covers topics such as solar eclipses, comets or
the International Space Station, and visitors hear about upcoming
celestial events of interest, such as the reappearance later this
month of Venus and Mars after sunset.</TE>
<TE>   Other club events include sky-watching parties at Mt. Pinos in Los
Padres National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in astronomy seems to wax and wane, depending on NASA's
success with its orbiting telescopes and planetary probes, Holland
said.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley resident Mike Lanska joined the society three years
ago after his wife bought him his first telescope. The general
contractor was so enraptured with what he saw through the
4-inch-diameter lens that just a month later he donated the $200
telescope to a local school and invested in a more powerful $3,000,
8-inch-diameter, computer-controlled model with which he can take
snapshots of distant stars.</TE>
<TE>   Equipped with a global-positioning device, Lanska's latest
telescope finds objects with the press of a few buttons, and even
follows them through the night sky as the Earth rotates.</TE>

<DH>Education: Moorpark and Oxnard campuses seek new
presidents, with challenges awaiting each leader. Nationally, pool of
qualified candidates is shrinking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One is considered the crown jewel of Ventura County's three community
colleges, a two-year school where the graduation and university
transfer rates rank among the highest in California.</LD>
<LD>   The other is often compared to a diamond in the rough, a college
long overshadowed by its older and bigger sister institutions, but
primed to fulfill its potential.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Moorpark and Oxnard colleges have something in common this
semester: Both are searching for new presidents at a time when
community colleges across the nation are competing for a shrinking
pool of qualified applicants to fill a rising number of top-level
vacancies.</LD>
<TE>   Within the next month, screening committees made up of faculty and
staff members, administrators and student representatives, will begin
combing through dozens of resumes and applications from across the
country. After narrowing the field to about a dozen candidates, the
committees will forward the names of five finalists to the college
district's board of trustees and Chancellor Phillip Westin, who will
make the final decision.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two institutions, Oxnard College may have more at stake.</TE>
<TE>   The 8,153-student campus has had five interim and permanent
presidents during the past eight years. It has been without stable
leadership since the December 2000 retirement of Steven Arvizu, who
left for health reasons after serving 2 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   An effort to name Arvizu's successor ended unsuccessfully in
October after Westin rejected two finalists for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Westin said neither had the skills nor experience to help boost
enrollment and meet the educational and job-training needs of the
college's increasingly diverse and comparatively under-prepared
student body.</TE>
<TE>   "We are definitely looking for stability," said Mary Jones,
president of Oxnard College's Academic Senate and a member of the
presidential search committee.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said the need for strong stewardship has become more vital
with the planned departure of the school's executive vice president,
Anthony Tricoli, who is leaving in May to assume the presidency of
West Hills College in Coalinga.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Moorpark College faces a different challenge as it
seeks to find a replacement for James Walker, who is retiring this
year after a decade as the college's chief executive. With 14,660
students, Moorpark is the largest of the county's community colleges
and has enjoyed a reputation for innovation and excellence during
Walker's tenure.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to setting high academic standards, the new college
presidents, who will be paid about $139,000 annually, are expected to
be technologically savvy and skilled at fund-raising, public speaking
and negotiating contracts.</TE>
<TE>   But each college has distinct challenges and the "type of person
who would be a good fit for one school wouldn't necessarily be a good
fit for the other," said Norm Nagel, president of the college
district's board of trustees.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, at Moorpark, where overcrowding is a problem, a
major issue will be finding ways to accommodate more growth while
maintaining quality, Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   At Oxnard College, where enrollment jumped 13%, the issue will
involve development of an infrastructure and a school identity that
appeals to businesses and residents, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, a lot of the students from Oxnard have gone to
Ventura College, and we need to get the programs and facilities in
Oxnard to the point where the community can identify with the school
so the students want to go there," Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, for instance, 181 Oxnard High School graduates enrolled
as first-time students at Ventura College, just eight fewer than the
number who elected to attend Oxnard College.</TE>
<TE>   Community college trustee Art Hernandez, who represents the Oxnard
area, said the new president needs to be someone who is comfortable
"talking to Chamber of Commerce leaders and parents who live off the
Gold Coast, as well as parents who work in the fields all day."</TE>
<TE>   "I want someone who sees Oxnard College as an opportunity, who
sees it as 'I can come in and make a difference,' not 'I can come in
and fix this,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Given the requirements of a president's job, it is not surprising
that community college districts throughout California "are having a
tougher time getting a deep and diverse pool" of qualified
applicants, state community colleges Chancellor Tom Nussbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is expected to get worse with the aging of the
nation's community college presidents, many of whom are expected to
retire within the next decade. As a result, Nussbaum's office is
working to revive several doctoral programs that would train
academics for leadership positions in higher education.</TE>
<TE>   Nagel said it may be easier to attract top-notch candidates if
voters approve a $356-million bond measure on the March 5 ballot that
would pay for renovation and construction work at the district's
three campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "In the eyes of a candidate, that could be a big selling point,"
he said. "It's always better to be in a place that has money to
spend."</TE>

<HD>Golf Course Plan Raises Concerns</HD>
<DH>Ojai: Supervisor Flynn wants answers on how the project
would affect the Ventura River.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerns that a proposed 200-acre public golf course in Ojai could
harm the Ventura River have one county supervisor planning on Tuesday
to ask more questions about an environmental study he supported last
week.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor John Flynn joined colleagues Judy Mikels and Frank
Schillo in voting for a study of the Farmont Golf Course plan that
would not have considered the water issue. On Friday, Flynn said he
would ask the board to hold a public hearing to discuss the project's
effect and to add the finding to the final report.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't ask the question about the surface water and ground
water and how much is being used," Flynn said. "I need to be
satisfied and I'm not at this point because I don't have the
answers."</LD>
<TE>   Supervisors Steve Bennett and Kathy Long were unsuccessful in
their bid last week to have the course's potential effect on local
water supplies included in the environmental review being conducted
by county planners.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say a second public course in Ojai would attract
golfers from throughout California. The 18-hole course, which could
open as early as summer 2003, would offer up to 130 rounds a day. The
city now has a public course at Soule Park and a private course at
the Ojai Valley Inn.</TE>
<TE>   In the environmentally sensitive Ojai Valley, plans for a third
course have critics fearing it would choke the city with traffic and
kill off the Ventura River habitat of steelhead trout.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the concern is that it will actually hurt the water
resources," said Tom Berg, director of the county's resource
management agency. "And some people philosophically don't like golf
courses."</TE>
<TE>   Although he doesn't play golf, Flynn said he will maintain an open
mind on the project "because I have two sons who play and a
son-in-law who is a golf fanatic."</TE>
<TE>   The project is a revised version of a private golf course plan
initially approved by the board in 1993 after a six-year battle.</TE>
<TE>   The original developer, the late Japanese media baron Kagehis
Toyama, had pledged a 1,500-acre easement adjoining the facility to
the Ojai Valley Land Conservancy for use as open space.</TE>
<TE>   The current developer, New York-based Intell Management &amp;
Investment Corp., has left open the future of the site and is
considering subdividing the area near the course into six parcels to
be sold and developed as mini-ranches.</TE>

<LD>Police were searching Saturday night for two hitchhikers who
carjacked a man at gunpoint in Oxnard, stole his credit card and
crashed his car a few miles away in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after 5 a.m. Saturday, Alfredo Aguayo picked up the
hitchhikers on the Ventura Freeway near Rose Avenue. Once inside the
car, the men tied up Aguayo's hands and put him in the back seat,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   The hitchhikers drove to an automated teller machine, where they
unsuccessfully tried to withdraw money from Aguayo's bank account,
police said.</LD>
<TE>   The hitchhikers then drove to Ventura, where they crashed the car
into a light pole on Seaward Avenue before fleeing on foot. Aguayo
freed himself and called police. He was treated for minor injuries
from the car crash.</TE>
<TE>   The hitchhikers were described as Latino and in their 20s. One is
about 6 feet, 180 to 190 pounds and dark skinned. The other is about
5 feet 5 and 130 to 140 pounds.</TE>

<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>After he failed in his alleged first attempt to board a
Paris-to-Miami flight and blow it out of the sky with explosives packed
into his shoes, Richard C. Reid sent an urgent e-mail to his suspected
terrorist handler, according to a Western diplomatic official familiar
with the case.</LD>
<LD>   Reid was spending the night at an airport hotel here after missing the
Dec. 21 flight because of a lengthy interrogation by police. What should
he do? The reply, which is believed to have come from his Al Qaeda boss
in Pakistan, was swift and clear, according to the official.</LD>
<LD>   "He got a quick response from his handler: Try again," the official
said.</LD>
<TE>   The next day, Reid was cleared to travel, boarded American Airlines
Flight 63 and allegedly tried to ignite the explosive devices in his
shoes but was overpowered by passengers and crew.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation has centered largely on e-mails Reid exchanged with
suspected confederates during long hours hunched over computer terminals
in cyber cafes in Brussels and Paris in December.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails and other emerging evidence have reinforced suspicions
that Reid was more than a freelance terrorist loosely affiliated with the
Al Qaeda network. In fact, investigators now believe that the alleged
"shoe bomber" jailed in the United States had ties to Al Qaeda terrorists
in Europe suspected in two other major conspiracies: an aborted plot to
bomb the U.S. Embassy in Paris and the assassination of Ahmed Shah
Masoud, a renowned anti-Taliban guerrilla leader, in Afghanistan two days
before the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   At least 19 suspects in those plots, both of which allegedly were
ordered by Osama bin Laden, have been arrested in recent months in
France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The three cases at first seemed to be separate and compartmentalized
operations in the trademark style of Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, but
investigators have found leads that could link them, according to
European law enforcement officials and others familiar with the cases.</TE>
<TE>   "There are elements that are connecting cases that at first did not
seem connected," a French law enforcement official said. "The overall
direction of the investigation shows that a French-Belgian axis was
involved in the Masoud and [embassy] cases. And we must be prudent, but
it seems Reid had contact with at least one of two [terrorist] structures
in those cases."</TE>
<TE>   The detective work has been slow and difficult because the Reid case
has strands in the United States, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Moreover, Reid's wanderings--and suspected activity scouting targets for
Al Qaeda--also took him to Israel, Egypt, the Gaza Strip, Turkey,
Pakistan, and Afghanistan, where he allegedly trained at an Al Qaeda
camp.</TE>
<TE>   The hulking, shaggy-haired 28-year-old remains an enigma in many ways:
a drifter who dressed like a bum and traveled as much as an executive.
Reid baffles police because his methods seemed alternately slick and
clumsy. Despite his allegedly stealthy preparations for the attack, a
French intelligence official told The Times, one reason Reid attracted
suspicion at his first airport check-in was that he was listening to a
tape of the Koran on a Walkman, apparently to psyche himself up.</TE>
<TE>   Reconstructing the virtual and physical trail that Reid left in the
gray immigrant neighborhoods of Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam could be
key to understanding and prosecuting the networks suspected of assisting
him, European and U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   During the crucial days and weeks before his attempted attack, Reid
apparently communicated with e-mail addresses in Belgium, France and the
Netherlands as well as in Pakistan, where he had spent recent years
immersed in Islamic extremism. Reid, the son of a Jamaican father and
British mother, made his most recent trip to Pakistan in August.</TE>
<TE>   Among the messages he sent from Europe, according to the Western
diplomatic official, police have found an e-mail that reveals a moment of
humanity: a farewell note to his mother in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   The message, sent shortly before Dec. 21, alluded to an act that would
bring Reid martyrdom and urged his mother one last time to convert to
Islam, a longtime obsession of his that had contributed to their
estrangement.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very clear that it was a goodbye letter," the official said.
"He said he was going out in a burst of glory for Allah. But it was not
specific what he was going to do or why."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not confirmed the locations of Reid's other
correspondents, including his suspected handler, officials say. The
investigators are hampered by the large quantity of data confiscated from
cyber cafes and by the fragmented, multinational configuration of
Internet communications networks, according to law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda's networks are similarly fragmented, deployed in cells among
many countries to escape detection and compartmentalize vital activities
such as supplying fraudulent documents and procuring weapons. Authorities
allege that Reid had a great advantage over many terrorists because he
used an authentic passport from Britain, a country whose citizens do not
trigger the same warning flags as those from the Middle East or North
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, authorities believe that Reid received support--money,
shelter, the explosives--from one of two interconnected networks that
were dominated by Algerians and Tunisians and spread across France,
Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The first network was dismantled in a wave of at least 13 arrests in
September of suspects who allegedly planned to bomb the U.S. Embassy in
Paris early this year.</TE>
<TE>   In December, police arrested six suspects in the second network on
charges of providing stolen Belgian passports to two Brussels-based
Tunisian suicide bombers who assassinated Masoud--a preemptive strike on
anti-Taliban forces that apparently was coordinated with the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   An investigative lead that could link Reid to the networks, according
to a European law enforcement official, is evidence that Reid had
telephone contact with Nizar Trabelsi, a Tunisian accused of planning to
act as the suicide bomber in the embassy plot.</TE>
<TE>   Trabelsi, a former professional soccer player with a record for
drug-dealing in the Netherlands and Germany, was arrested Sept. 13 in an
apartment in Brussels during a raid that turned up a list of suspected
bomb-making chemicals. The list included the formula for the same mixture
of explosives--PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate, and TATP, or
triacetone triperoxide--found in Reid's shoes, according to the Western
diplomatic official. Belgian police later found bomb-making chemicals in
the basement of an Egyptian snack bar owned by the family of a suspect
who was arrested with Trabelsi.</TE>
<TE>   The suspected phone contact between Reid and Trabelsi occurred "well
before" the arrests of both men, according to the European law
enforcement official, who declined to give further details.</TE>
<TE>   Trabelsi also connects the embassy plot to the Masoud assassination
because he associated with Tarek Maaroufi, a Tunisian-born Belgian
citizen suspected of aiding Masoud's attackers and acting as a senior Al
Qaeda leader linked to cells across Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Police are pursuing leads indicating that Reid also may have had
contact with the "known support cells" involved in the Masoud case, the
Western official says.</TE>
<TE>   Despite promising advances, the investigation has by no means
established that Reid and the others were part of a monolithic network,
the European law enforcement official cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   "It is logical in that world that there would be points of contact,"
the official said. "Trabelsi and Reid could easily have met each other in
[an Al Qaeda] training camp in Afghanistan. Maaroufi is another potential
point of contact for many because of his prominence."</TE>
<TE>   Reid's odyssey preceding his alleged attempt to blow up the plane is
suggestive because he followed a route that recurs in the other cases.
After returning from Pakistan, he stayed in Amsterdam, where he held odd
jobs; Trabelsi had spent time in the Netherlands, and two other embassy
plot suspects were arrested in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   Between Dec. 7 and Dec. 16, Reid stayed at the Dar es Salaam Hotel in
a largely immigrant neighborhood of Brussels. The hotel is an inexpensive
establishment near the snack bar where police had seized the bomb-making
chemicals linked to Trabelsi. In addition to obtaining a new British
passport at the consulate in Brussels, Reid spent a lot of time on his
own in three cyber cafes, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   After traveling by train to Paris, Reid frequented the Goutte d'Or
neighborhood north of the Gare du Nord train station. The area is
dominated by North African immigrants, but this time Reid wasn't alone.
Three men accompanied him during a visit to the Happy Call cyber cafe,
according to the Sri Lankan manager, who told journalists that Reid stood
out because he was "big and dirty."</TE>
<TE>   The sighting of the companions deepens suspicions that Reid had
accomplices who may have given him lodging in Paris. A canvass by police
has not found any signs that he stayed at a hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The Reid probe could illuminate the workings of the European terror
networks, identify new suspects and strengthen the evidence against those
in custody. But it will require a lot of basic, grueling investigative
work, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a dry well," the Western diplomatic official said. "Or it
could be a 'eureka' case."</TE>

<HD>Bush Seeks to Shift Burden on Jobless Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration will ask Congress on Monday to overhaul the
nation's system of unemployment insurance, gradually shifting financial
responsibility from the federal government to the states for the
Depression-era program that remains a bedrock protection for middle-class
workers.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal is part of President Bush's 2003 budget, which calls for
sharp cuts in the federal unemployment tax.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, which has been kept closely under wraps, states would
assume the unemployment insurance program's administrative costs. The
U.S. Labor Department, however, would continue to oversee the program.
And administration officials said there would be no reduction in
unemployment benefits.</LD>
<TE>   The plan to reduce the federal government's financial stake, even when
couched as overdue reform, is certain to cause unease among many
Democrats and organized labor.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment insurance is a jointly run program, with the federal
government paying for most administrative costs and states financing the
benefits, with each part funded by a separate payroll tax levied on
employers.</TE>
<TE>   The program has been under attack for years from all sides. State
officials contend that red tape from Washington is often excessive.
Worker advocates say the modern economy, which has created more part-time
and low-paying jobs, requires a broader set of benefits. And many
employers say that Washington holds on to too much of their payroll
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it will make unemployment insurance benefits and
employment services more responsive to the needs of employees and
business," said Assistant Labor Secretary Emily Stover DeRocco. "It
clearly will give states more flexibility."</TE>
<TE>   Some argue that the federal government, in fact, should assume an even
larger role in the program to ensure that states maintain financially
stable, adequate benefit programs.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, New York and Texas disclosed that they need more than
$1 billion combined from Washington to help bail out their unemployment
funds. Other state funds also may be in a precarious position.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government should take more of a role in leading the
federal-state unemployment system--not less," said David Socolow, who
follows the issue as a legislative representative for the AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment compensation is one of several friction points that are
emerging between labor groups and the administration.</TE>
<TE>   In Bush's budget, to be released Monday, training programs for adults,
youth and dislocated workers may face a proposed cut of $875 million, or
25%, according to nongovernmental sources close to the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Every other day, we hear about thousands of people being laid off
from large corporations, and these layoffs always have significant ripple
effects," said Neil Bomberg, a labor specialist for the National Assn. of
Counties.</TE>
<TE>   Under the administration's unemployment insurance plan, the federal
government would continue to hold states accountable for making timely
and accurate benefit payments to the unemployed. It would retain its role
as a lender to shaky state unemployment funds and would continue to
participate in the joint program that is designed to provide extended
benefits for the long-term unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   In his State of the Union address, Bush reaffirmed his support for a
deal in which the federal government would help pay many workers an
additional 13 weeks of benefits, on top of the normal 26 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Coll, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and
Budget, emphasized that nothing in the White House proposal would reduce
benefits for unemployed workers. "We're actually going to make it easier
for states to extend benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many states have lamented what they see as heavy-handed
federal management of their unemployment programs. Some employers and
state officials also argue that the federal government has been amassing
far too much unemployment tax revenue--more than $38 billion--while
sending back insufficient amounts to the states.</TE>
<TE>   The states rely on Washington to pay about $3 billion in annual costs
of administering their programs. U.S. Labor officials also have the
responsibility of ensuring that benefits are paid out correctly and on
time, a role that the Bush administration said it would retain.</TE>
<TE>   To pay for such administrative activities, the federal government
taxes employers at a rate of 0.8% on the first $7,000 of each worker's
wages. In recent years of low unemployment, those tax revenues have
skyrocketed beyond costs, leading to demands that Washington ship back
billions of dollars to the states.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush plan would cut the 0.8% tax to 0.6% in 2003 and ultimately
scale it down, perhaps to 0.2% in five years. To help offset that reduced
revenue, states would receive a quick infusion of $9.2 billion from the
overflowing federal funds. The Bush plan envisions future installments
totaling $5 billion, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very excited about this," said Eric J. Oxfeld, president of
UWC-Strategic Services on Unemployment and Workers' Compensation, a
business organization that closely monitors unemployment benefit issues.
"It's a very positive step forward dealing with a severe problem and
getting rid of an unnecessary tax on payroll. We're looking forward to
seeing the full proposal in detail."</TE>
<TE>   A potential difficulty with the proposal is that states may face
increasing pressure to raise their own payroll taxes on employers.
Supporters of the White House approach say that the tax burden on
employers could remain below today's combined state-federal levels
because of more efficient management.</TE>
<TE>   But others say the proposal raises significant questions about the
financial underpinnings of the venerable New Deal-era program.</TE>
<TE>   For example, some analysts fear that reducing the federal government's
middleman role in administering the state benefits could lead to a
situation in which states with the greatest unemployment would end up
with the weakest funds. In the current setup, the federal government is
able to function as an equalizer between states that are hard hit and
those that are booming.</TE>
<TE>   "States will find the proposal attractive in the near term," said Rich
Hobbie, unemployment insurance director at the National Assn. of State
Workforce Agencies, noting the administration's promise to streamline the
bureaucracy and White House plans to return $14 billion to the states
over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   "In the longer term," he said, "they might have to raise state
unemployment taxes to cover their costs when they take on this added
responsibility--and they might be concerned about that."</TE>

<HD>Internal Report Cites Extensive Abuse at Enron</HD>
<DH>Review: Panel puts the blame for the firm's collapse squarely on
corporate management, accounting firm, lawyers and the board itself for
inadequate oversight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>An internal report on the collapse of Enron Corp. painted a
scathing picture of corporate greed and mismanagement Saturday,
concluding that accounting abuses masked more than $1 billion in losses
in a one-year period alone.</LD>
<LD>   The report assigned widespread blame to Enron management, the Andersen
accounting firm, company lawyers and the board itself for creating and
failing to oversee a series of partnerships that sparked the company's
Dec. 2 bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   It leveled its sternest criticism at Andrew S. Fastow, the former
Enron chief financial officer who engineered a series of partnerships
that "became, over time, a means of both enriching himself personally and
facilitating manipulation of Enron's financial statements."</LD>
<TE>   "Enron employees involved in the partnerships were enriched, in the
aggregate, by tens of millions of dollars they should never have
received," said the report.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis was done by a three-member panel led by William Powers
Jr., dean of the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, who was
added to the board Oct. 31 to lead the probe.</TE>
<TE>   "Individually, and collectively, Enron's management failed to carry
out its substantive responsibility for ensuring that the transactions
were fair to Enron--which in many cases they were not," it said.</TE>
<TE>   As a detailed record of Enron's murky partnerships, the report may
serve as a road map to congressional investigators and federal regulatory
agencies examining the collapse of Enron, which went from the nation's
seventh-largest company in revenue to a Dec. 2 bankruptcy, becoming a
symbol of corporate abuse and greed.</TE>
<TE>   The 203-page report was released just ahead of ousted Enron Chief
Executive Kenneth L. Lay's appearance Monday before a Senate committee.
It noted that Lay, a major fund-raiser for President Bush, was "captain
of the ship" for most of the time that abuses were occurring and "bears
significant responsibility for . . . flawed decisions" of subordinates.</TE>
<TE>   The report provided a detailed account of the partnerships run by
Fastow, who was forced out as chief financial officer amid growing
concerns over Enron's finances.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow earned at least $30 million from the partnerships he ran, known
as LJM, the report says, the three-letter acronym representing the names
of his wife and two children. Though the board approved a highly unusual
structure that allowed Fastow to run the outside entities, Fastow hid the
outsized profits he was making, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   In a partnership known as Southampton Place, for example, Fastow's
$25,000 investment ballooned into $4.5 million in two months, said the
report, which was filed late Saturday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   "What he [Fastow] presented as an arrangement intended to benefit
Enron became, over time, a means of both enriching himself personally and
facilitating manipulation of Enron's financial statements," the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow associate Michael Kopper pocketed at least $10 million while
four others made up to $1 million each.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's disintegration was "the result of failures at many levels and
by many people," the report concludes. "Many of those consequences could
and should have been avoided."</TE>
<TE>   The report also indicates that the company's top management had
received a warning signal about the controversial partnerships and the
conflicts of interest they represented far earlier than previously known.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2000, then-Treasurer Jeffrey McMahon approached
then-President Jeffrey K. Skilling with "serious concerns about Enron's
dealings with the LJM partnerships," the report said, citing an account
from McMahon.</TE>
<TE>   The report said that if McMahon's version--disputed by Skilling--is
correct, "it appears that Skilling did not take action . . . after being
put on notice that Fastow was pressuring Enron employees who were
negotiating with LJM."</TE>
<TE>   Fastow and McMahon could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Skilling said the report in its whole "bears out
what Mr. Skilling has been saying for months. Mr. Skilling was not
involved in any improprieties."</TE>
<TE>   The report also criticizes the company's public disclosures about its
financial condition--a focal point for the scores of investors and
employees who have sued the company over their severe losses in Enron
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Enron revealed the existence of the partnerships in SEC filings, the
report points out. But the disclosures were "obtuse" and "failed to
convey the substance of what was going on between Enron and the
partnerships."</TE>
<TE>   The report rebukes almost every aspect of the partnerships, including
LJM Cayman, LJM-2 Co-Investment and Chewco Investments. They are
described as intended largely to shield from view the mountains of debt
that the company was hoping to keep off its balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investigation identified significant problems beyond those Enron
has already disclosed," the report states, including fundamental flaws in
the very structure of the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   The partnerships appear to have been "designed to accomplish favorable
financial statement results, not to achieve bona fide economic
objectives," the report says, adding that some of the accounting was
"clearly wrong."</TE>
<TE>   For example, some partnerships ostensibly had arrangements to bring in
outside partners to shield, or hedge, Enron from risk.</TE>
<TE>   But the supposed hedging was actually a charade because they were done
largely with Enron stock, the report finds. Thus, the partnerships were
vulnerable to a decline in Enron stock, and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Enron sold assets to LJM to remove them from its books. But, the
report says, the transactions appeared to be maneuvers to hide losses
from investors. In five of seven such sales, Enron repurchased the
assets, sometimes within months, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the LJM partnerships claimed profits on each deal even when the
assets appeared to have fallen in value.</TE>
<TE>   In all, such transactions "resulted in Enron reporting earnings . . .
that were almost $1 billion higher than should have been reported" for
the year ending in the third quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The report harshly criticizes Enron's outside professional advisors,
the accounting giant Andersen and law firm Vinson &amp; Elkins.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen did not fulfill its professional responsibilities in
connection with its audits of Enron's financial statements, or its
obligation to bring to the attention of Enron's board, concerns about
Enron's internal controls over related-party transactions," the committee
report states.</TE>
<TE>   An internal Andersen e-mail from last February suggests that Andersen
had concerns about disclosures of the partnerships. But according to the
report, an Andersen partner told Enron's audit committee one week after
that e-mail that "disclosure [had been] reviewed for adequacy" and that
Andersen would sign off on Enron's financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen officials dismissed the report out of hand Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "The authors of this report were handpicked by Enron's board, and it's
now clear that the report's conclusions are extremely self-serving," said
Charlie Leonard, a spokesman for Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard said the report didn't contradict congressional testimony
given by Andersen's chief executive, who said Enron withheld vital
information related to one of the off-book partnerships, Chewco. He also
said the Enron committee rebuffed attempts by Andersen to provide
information about its activities.</TE>
<TE>   The committee report said Vinson &amp; Elkins, the Houston law firm that
prepared partnership-related documents for Enron, "should have brought a
stronger, more objective and more critical voice to the disclosure
process."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Householder, a spokesman for the firm, said Saturday: "We are
confident that when all the facts are known about the role we played, it
will be seen that we met our professional obligations."</TE>
<TE>   Enron was formed in 1985 by the merger of two fairly conventional
natural gas pipeline operators. But Lay and his handpicked successor,
Skilling, transformed Enron in the 1990s into a nimble trading company
that had little interest in expensive hard assets, such as natural gas
fields and power plants.</TE>
<TE>   When times were good, up until only a few months ago, the MBAs and
PhDs that roamed Enron's Houston trading floor were taking one of every
four wholesale trades in electricity and natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's well-paid executives were dreaming up new markets to
deregulate and making them happen, cozying up to powerful politicians and
regulators to craft laws and policies to Enron's benefit, pushing
accounting rules to their limits and beyond to burnish Enron's financial
statements and keep that all-important stock price climbing.</TE>
<TE>   But Enron exploded spectacularly in a span of less than seven weeks,
the victim of a near-fatal cash crunch caused as investors, banks and
trading partners shunned the energy merchant after a series of damaging
financial disclosures.</TE>
<TE>   Troubles in some controversial off-balance-sheet partnerships slashed
more than $1 billion from shareholders' equity and forced Enron to reduce
nearly five years of earnings by almost $600 million. Critics contend
more debt and losses are hidden in dozens of other partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Since Dec. 2, Enron has held a new distinction as the largest resident
ever of U.S. Bankruptcy Court--a descent that left more than 6,000 of its
21,000 employees out of work and shattered the savings of thousands more
employees and investors who held large chunks of Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has a new interim chief executive, a restructuring specialist
named Stephen Cooper. It has given its core energy trading business to
UBS Warburg in exchange for a cut of any future profits, and it has sold
its biggest pipeline to Dynegy Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, its executives and directors are the subject of dozens of
lawsuits as well as investigations by several congressional panels,
federal agencies and regulators. Lay and Skilling are both scheduled to
testify before Congress this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron debacle has also claimed a life: Former Enron Vice Chairman
J. Clifford Baxter, a critic of the partnership deals, was found shot to
death in his car. The death was ruled a suicide by the Harris County,
Texas, medical examiner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the committee were Herbert S. Winokur Jr., chairman of
Capricorn Holdings Inc., a private investment firm based in Greenwich,
Conn., and Raymond S. Troubh, a financial consultant. Troubh joined the
Enron board in mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   The panel said it reviewed more than 430,000 pages of documents and
interviewed more than 65 people.</TE>
<TE>   It hired its own lawyer, William R. McLucas, former SEC enforcement
chief, and its own accountant, Deloitte &amp; Touche.</TE>
<TE>   The 55-year-old Powers, who received his law degree from Harvard Law
School in 1973, teaches torts and product liability law, among other
subjects. Powers is scheduled to testify Tuesday before Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The complexity of the report, and its late filing, left little time
for immediate reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen the report," said White House spokesman Jimmy Orr.
"We haven't had a chance to review the report. The report has not been
delivered to the White House. Therefore it would be inappropriate to
comment on a report we have not seen."</TE>
<TE>   But one Enron executive who had raised objections to the partnerships,
and who asked not to be named, said Saturday that there is a measure of
vindication in its findings</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice," the executive said, "for someone else to say there was
something rotten in Denmark."</TE>

<HD>There's a Sense of Deja Vu as Bush Prepares Budget</HD>
<DH>Spending: On a smaller scale, same components of 1980s White Houses
are being reassembled.</DH>

<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Big tax cuts. Big increases in defense spending. And the return of
federal budget deficits that squeeze the rest of government.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly the battle over the budget that President Bush will release
Monday is beginning to look a lot like the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Through the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the current
president's father, the interaction of tax cuts, a major defense buildup
and budget deficits dominated the domestic agenda and provoked intense
conflict between and within the parties.</LD>
<TE>   Now, on a smaller scale, the same ingredients are being reassembled as
Bush pursues a rapid wartime increase in defense spending, looks to
expand his sweeping tax cut and warns of a return to deficits for at
least the next few years--and much longer than that if Social Security
revenue is excluded from the ledger.</TE>
<TE>   "It really feels like it is a deja vu all over again," said Tom Kahn,
the Democratic staff director on the House Budget Committee. "We have
seen this movie before, and here we are back to it again. I think it is
hauntingly similar."</TE>
<TE>   Economically, the current situation differs in some important ways
from the 1980s. The overall deficits now aren't projected to grow nearly
as large as in the Reagan years.</TE>
<TE>   That's partly because the country today is in a stronger position to
handle new fiscal pressures than in the 1980s: Bush inherited a
significant surplus, while the budget was already in deficit when Reagan
took office. And the Social Security system still is generating
surpluses, which partially offset the rapidly growing deficits in the
government's general operating account.</TE>
<TE>   "We start in a very much better place," said Rudolph G. Penner, a
former director of the Congressional Budget Office.</TE>
<TE>   But politically, the dynamic still could look very similar. Just as in
the 1980s, tax cuts and the expanding defense budget could leave little
room for the other priorities many Democrats want to emphasize.</TE>
<TE>   "The implications are that the president will succeed in freezing the
Democratic Party agenda while he advances his own," said Will Marshall,
executive director of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist
Democratic think tank.</TE>
<TE>   The key political difference is that under Reagan the fight to
eliminate deficits was led largely by Republican fiscal conservatives,
such as Sens. Bob Dole of Kansas and Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire.
Today, most GOP officeholders, from Bush on down, are placing a much
higher priority on cutting taxes than avoiding the return of deficits.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that same consensus [on reducing deficits] is there in
the Republican Party," said Rudman, now the co-chairman of the Concord
Coalition, a deficit watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   That shift inside the GOP assures that any attempt to control the
emerging deficits will be a highly contentious fight--and less likely to
succeed. "I think we are maybe a couple of years away from [action on the
deficit]," Rudman said.</TE>
<TE>   Reagan's 1981 budget plan--which cut tax rates and began a rapid
defense buildup--shaped the political agenda for the rest of that decade.
The large federal deficits that immediately followed became Washington's
central domestic focus.</TE>
<TE>   Dole and his allies pursued a series of measures to reduce the deficit
that culminated in the 1990 budget summit, where then-President Bush
agreed to raise taxes, abandoning his famed campaign pledge not to do so.
Budget agreements between President Clinton and Congress in 1993 and
1997, combined with rapid economic growth, eliminated the deficit and
produced surpluses from 1998 through 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the budget battered by war, recession and the initial effect
of the 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut that became law in June, the
administration projects deficits in the unified budget--which includes
Social Security and the government's general operating funds--of $106
billion this year, $80 billion in 2003 and $14 billion in 2004. Setting
aside the funds in Social Security, the Congressional Budget Office
projects deficits at least through the rest of this decade.</TE>
<TE>   The weak economy and unavoidable demands of war explain a significant
part of the change. But Bush's policy changes approach the magnitude of
Reagan's. Peter R. Orszag of the nonpartisan Brookings Institution in
Washington has calculated that if Bush's tax cut is made permanent--as
the president has proposed--it would cost the government an amount equal
to around 2% of the gross national product. That's roughly the same cost
as the 1981 Reagan tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   It's more difficult to compare the size of Bush's defense buildup
because the administration hasn't signaled its long-term plans. But it
could approach Reagan's effort.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush wins the $48-billion increase he proposed for 2003, defense
spending could grow to as much as 3.7% of the economy, up from 2.9% when
he took office, according to Richard Kogan of the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a liberal policy analysis group. That would mean that,
as a share of the economy, defense spending under Bush would rise in just
two years about three-fifths as much as it did through the first six
years of the Reagan buildup.</TE>
<TE>   Against the backdrop of Sept. 11, that increase isn't likely to face
as much congressional resistance as Reagan's did. And if the greater
defense spending is approved, Democrats looking for money for more
domestic initiatives--or a greater effort to pay down the national
debt--ultimately may have no choice but to challenge the Bush tax cut,
many in the party believe.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly [the budget framework] puts the Democrats in the hole, which
is why they cannot accept as a fait accompli the tax strategy Bush has
laid out," Marshall said.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, some top congressional Democrats say any concerted party
attempt to reduce Bush's tax cut still could be years away. It may take
that long, one senior Democratic senator said, to make a case that
deficits are a threat to other public priorities.</TE>
<TE>   On the GOP side, some conservatives believe the impending deficits
should force spending cuts and reforms "throughout government." But for
now, Bush has displayed none of Reagan's early-term enthusiasm for
attempting major cuts in domestic programs; to the contrary, he is
courting Democrats with proposals to spend more on education,
prescription drugs and health care, though not as much as most Democrats
want.</TE>
<TE>   The threshold debate remains the same as in the 1980s: Whether the
benefits of eliminating the deficit are worth the policy and political
costs. Many conservatives note that the projected deficits are much
smaller, as a share of the economy, than deficits under Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   But the deficits are smaller today partly because the Social Security
accounts temporarily are running a huge surplus before the baby boom
generation begins retiring in large numbers this decade. Until this year,
both political parties had earmarked those surpluses mostly for paying
down the national debt.</TE>
<TE>   Now the budget picture has deteriorated so rapidly that the CBO
projects the government will have to tap those excess Social Security
funds to pay for other operations through 2011 if the tax cut is made
permanent. Because of that, the CBO says the government will pay off much
less of the national debt than Bush proposed a year ago. And the CBO
calculates the higher debt will increase federal interest costs over its
earlier estimates by a resounding $1 trillion during the next decade,
which could leave less money to meet the growing cost of Social Security
and Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, some Democrats insist the new deficits may carry a larger
economic cost because they are coming so close to the baby boom
generation's retirement surge. "The worst dynamic that's being created,"
said Gene Sperling, Clinton's White House economic advisor, "is that the
draining of long-term [surpluses is] going to make any Social Security or
Medicare reform much more painful."</TE>
<TE>   That would follow the 1980s pattern as well. The longer the budget
deficits persisted, the more politically painful it became to deal with
them. Just ask Bush's father--who lost the presidency two years after
approving his deficit reduction package--and Clinton, who lost control of
Congress the year after signing his.</TE>

<HD>Unlikely Note Is Struck on World Finance Stage</HD>
<DH>Forum: Bill Gates and Bono challenge the Treasury chief and the
U.S. to boost foreign aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>At one end of the dais was Uncle Sam's chief financial
representative, a man seen by some at this year's World Economic Forum as
Uncle Scrooge: Paul H. O'Neill, an unapologetic opponent of increased aid
from the world's wealthiest nation to the world's poorest nations.</LD>
<LD>   On the other side, taking on the Treasury secretary and his
tightfisted policies, was the new odd couple of the aid advocacy world:
the wealthiest nation's wealthiest man, Bill Gates, in his trademark
mail-order glasses and open-collar shirt, and Bono, the Irish rock star,
in his trademark wraparound shades and much more open collar.</LD>
<LD>   Looking squarely at O'Neill, his fellow panelist at a session during
the annual forum's third day here, Gates chastised the U.S. government
Saturday as "the laggard" among world aid donors.</LD>
<TE>   "If we took the world and reordered it so that you and me were close
to a random neighborhood from some other part of the world, you would see
the living conditions, the medical problems, the infant mortality, and of
course the human spirit would respond to that," Gates said.</TE>
<TE>   Bono, who has emerged at the forum as the unlikely chief spokesman for
developing nations and international aid programs, was clearly pleased to
have his new billionaire friend taking the lead Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that he once enlisted Pope John Paul II in his campaign for
debt relief for poor nations--"an unusual juxtaposition" that he said was
calculated to attract media attention--the U2 front man smiled broadly as
he and Gates reiterated pleas for aid later at a joint news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I am here with the pope of software, making another unusual
juxtaposition," Bono said.</TE>
<TE>   After announcing Saturday that he is personally giving an additional
$50 million to combat the worldwide spread of AIDS, Gates challenged
O'Neill and the Bush administration to increase U.S. government funding
for health-care programs in sub-Saharan Africa and other poor regions.
More money for vaccinations alone could save 2 million lives a year,
Gates said, "and if the U.S. doesn't do it, it is not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, however, politely but pointedly dismissed the criticism from
the software tycoon and the rock star, making clear that he remains
opposed to appeals for a major increase in aid from wealthy nations. Poor
countries have received "trillions of dollars in aid over the years with
precious little to show for it," he said, a calculation that appeared
from his later remarks to include the costs of the many internationally
backed bailouts of indebted nations from Asia to Latin America in recent
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, how do we create a situation so that people become
engines of economic progress, and not just objects of our pity?" O'Neill
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bono retorted that without outside help for basic health care, many
poor countries will find economic progress impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "Dead people don't make a great work force," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Britain, France and other European nations have been pushing plans to
boost aid from the world's wealthiest nations to poor countries and
regions, but the Bush administration has blocked the proposals. In
November, O'Neill in effect vetoed a proposed call by the finance
ministers of the wealthy Group of 7 nations that they all aim to devote
0.7% of their gross domestic product to international aid programs. Few
now are close to that goal; the furthest away, figures show, is the
United States, where an estimated 0.1% of the GDP goes to foreign aid.
The United Nations has long sought commitments from rich countries to
boost aid to 1% of GDP.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the U.S. Treasury torpedoed proposals to have wealthy
nations pledge an eventual doubling in their foreign aid commitment, an
idea backed most prominently by Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer. Proponents had hoped to have the pledge adopted at a U.N.
conference on foreign aid in Monterrey, Mexico, next month. But the
administration told conference planners that President Bush would cancel
a planned appearance there if specific aid commitments were adopted,
diplomats at the United Nations said.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico, counting on Bush's presence to give greater prominence to the
conference, urged the Europeans to back away from their insistence on
fixed aid goals, the diplomats said. Last week, the White House announced
that Bush would attend.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, asked here whether he agreed with the goals endorsed by Brown
and others, said he is "not charmed by proposals" to set specific targets
for aid increases.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it that the spread between those of us who are privileged and
those of us who are not is so incomprehensibly large?" O'Neill said. "My
answer to that question is: Up until now, we've lacked imagination."</TE>
<TE>   But Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's former president, who also appeared on
the panel with O'Neill, suggested mildly that what is lacking isn't
imagination, but cash.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we update institutions, the bottom line is, we still need
money," Zedillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), speaking from the audience, also
challenged O'Neill. Less than 1% of the U.S. federal budget is spent on
foreign aid, he said, with the bulk of that going to Israel and Egypt and
what Leahy characterized as disguised export promotion programs and funds
for "the failed war" on drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are left with a tiny, tiny portion for very poor countries," Leahy
said. "It's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   The new focus on health and on environmental problems in poor
countries by Gates and other wealthy philanthropists--Ted Turner and the
Hewlett and Packard families, among others--has been cited by some U.S.
opponents of government assistance as a more efficient and focused form
of foreign aid. But Gates argued vigorously here for greatly increased
aid from the United States and other official donors.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly private philanthropy is no substitute for governmental
action here," Gates told reporters later. "The scale of the problem, and
the need to engage it government-to-government, is just way too great for
this to be done, even with the increases you will be seeing in private
philanthropy."</TE>
<TE>   More official funding of health and development programs in poor
nations also will attract more money from private charities, Gates said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have said to governments that 'if you step up and increase, we
will be stepping up and increasing as well,' " said Gates, whose personal
foundation reports that it has given out $2.8 billion in grants and
pledged $2.1 billion more since its creation two years ago. More than
half the grants have gone to global health projects, it says.</TE>
<TE>   In their joint appeal for aid to poor nations, Gates let Bono do most
of the talking.</TE>
<TE>   Though the rock star had described himself to a forum concert audience
as "the poor man's James Joyce or the thinking man's Perry Como," he came
across Saturday as a secretly studious policy wonk in hipster's clothing.
With Gates attentively nodding, he spoke offhandedly about the Group of 8
summit in Canada later this year, his recent drug pricing discussions
with executives from major drug companies, and the debate over
"conditionality" in World Bank debt restructuring programs.</TE>
<TE>   Bono was carefully diplomatic about O'Neill, giving him credit for
honesty--"the secretary's position accurately reflects a certain distrust
in the U.S. about foreign aid," he said--and disclosing plans to
accompany O'Neill on a visit to Africa in a month and a half. The
Treasury Department later confirmed plans for the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about hanging out with Republicans is that it is very
unhip for both of us," Bono said. "There is a parity of pain there."</TE>
<TE>   Outside, unseen by Gates or Bono or any other forum participants,
about 7,000 demonstrators converged for the largest protests yet against
the five-day gathering of political and business leaders. The protesters
represented a variety of causes, from animal rights and environmentalism
to Palestinian nationalism and anti-globalization campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Holding brightly colored signs, the marchers were watched by thousands
of police officers who walked alongside, behind and in front of them as
they made their way toward the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the site of the
forum. Officials said 36 people were arrested for misdemeanor offenses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about greed, man," said college student Joel Silverman, who
had come to protest international bankers' "blatant manipulation" of poor
economies.</TE>
<TE>   As she donned a rubber Statue of Liberty crown, Michelle Arti of
France called the forum "a force for evil."</TE>
<TE>   Most New Yorkers paid little heed, but some watching the protests were
openly antagonistic.</TE>
<TE>   "Go home!" yelled a man in front of a Gap store near 59th Street, a
target of protests earlier in the week. "We've had enough craziness in
this town--we don't need any more."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Framed against the snow-draped peaks of the Wasatch Range, downtown
buildings have been draped in huge blue-tinted wraps. There's a skater on
the Mormon church's central office building. A skier on a bank building.
A biathlon racer on the concert hall.</LD>
<LD>   There are also 8-foot-high chain-link fences around the press center,
the medals plaza, the athletes' village. Night and day, soldiers in
camouflage gear stand watch, helmets on, rifles slung over their
shoulders. Up above, there is the unmistakable sound of Black Hawk
military helicopters patrolling Salt Lake City, site of the Winter
Olympic Games.</LD>
<LD>   "We are so ready," Caroline Shaw, spokeswoman for the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee, said as she surveyed pizza boxes, soda cans and
water bottles in the committee's offices--another of last week's
late-night meals.</LD>
<TE>   "We are ready to have the baby."</TE>
<TE>   The XIX Winter Olympic Games begin Friday amid terrorism fears and
tight security. President Bush is expected to attend the nighttime
opening ceremony, which will be televised around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Security efforts are unprecedented," said International Olympic
Committee President Jacques Rogge, in his newly opened office here.</TE>
<TE>   These Games, together with today's Super Bowl, mark the debut of a new
era in American security, a test of the nation's ability to protect
itself--and athletes and spectators from around the world--after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to know that our government officials are doing
absolutely everything possible," Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson
said. "That does not mean there are no risks. That doesn't mean there are
any absolute guarantees. Our success in pulling this off is going to
speak very loudly to the commitment of the government in this country to
providing for the safety and security of our citizens."</TE>
<TE>   They are the first Winter Olympics in the United States in 22
years--since the Lake Placid Games in New York in 1980--and will be the
last Olympics in this nation for at least 10 years. The Olympic Village
expects to check in about 2,500 athletes from 77 nations this week--as
well as Rogge, in his first Games as IOC president, who has said he
intends to bunk there.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect very good Games," Rogge said.</TE>
<TE>   He and other officials are pleased with the city's preparedness. "The
computers are ready. The trailers are ready. The bleachers are in. The
fields of play are superb," said Mitt Romney, president of the organizing
committee.</TE>
<TE>   Ticketing, transport, the prospect of athletes testing positive for
drugs and, as always in the Winter Olympics, the weather remain concerns.
But the overriding issue--for athletes, officials and fans--has been
security.</TE>
<TE>   For the IOC, security has been "priority No. 1," Rogge said, ever
since the kidnapping and murders of 11 Israelis at the 1972 Munich Summer
Games in Germany. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York
and the Pentagon, a thorough review of the Games' security plan was
undertaken, and the U.S. government increased funding by $55 million.</TE>
<TE>   Security costs for the Salt Lake Games now total $310 million, a
record for a U.S. Olympics, with the federal government underwriting $240
million.</TE>
<TE>   For comparison, after accounting for inflation, the U.S. government
paid $101 million to help fund security for the 1996 Summer Games in
Atlanta--which attracted about 10,000 athletes, four times the number in
Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   The Secret Service has led the security planning for Salt Lake. The
FBI is in charge should an incident unfold.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration will bar air traffic over Salt
Lake City during the opening and closing ceremonies, and shut down the
international airport for several hours. General aviation is being
restricted, with portable control towers being set up this weekend in
Salt Lake and Provo to handle the extra small-plane traffic.</TE>
<TE>Lessons Learned From Atlanta Bombing</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dispatched
bioterrorism experts and stockpiled vaccines and antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   Security planners in Salt Lake have sought to draw on lessons from the
1996 Games, which were marred by a bomb that exploded in Centennial
Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta, killing one person and wounding more
than 100.</TE>
<TE>   Centennial Olympic Park was an open space without fences. In Salt
Lake, the medals plaza downtown--where gold, silver and bronze will be
awarded nightly and big-name musical acts are due to play--is encircled
by fencing. Fans will have to pass through airport-style metal detectors
to get in.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about security risks, Romney said late last week, "I don't think
it's clear if there's a more likely place or another.</TE>
<TE>   "We will make mistakes. We will be judged by whether we respond to
those mistakes and whether we are fair in our response."</TE>
<TE>   In all, 10,000 law enforcement officers and military personnel have
been drafted to patrol the various venues--2,100 Utah police officers,
400 law enforcement volunteers from other states, 1,600 officers under
Secret Service authority, 1,400 FBI agents or staffers, 1,000 federal
officers from various agencies and 3,500 from the military.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 5,000 people will be on-site as event services officials
whose duties can include security. In addition, there are about 1,500
private security guards assigned to warehouses, hotels and other
sensitive sites.</TE>
<TE>   Even with all those numbers, there remain potential vulnerabilities.
Organizers asked last week for up to 60 more officers to patrol a
pedestrian mall in Park City, the upscale mountain resort where crowds
are expected to gather nightly to take in the Games on two big-screen
TVs.</TE>
<TE>   The narrow thoroughfare of galleries, restaurants and tourist shops on
old Main Street will be blocked to vehicles during the day, forcing
businesses to stock up between midnight and dawn. But there will be no
tight security fencing in most of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "All along, everyone has said there's always a certain price you pay
for the freedom of people's ability to move around freely," said Bill
Malone, director of the Park City Chamber of Commerce. "It's in the
middle of town. You can't just fence people's homes off."</TE>
<TE>   Business owners, who have seen an alarming slump in the windup to the
Olympics (hotel bookings are down 25% but will pick up when the Games
begin), have been largely cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be difficult for us to move [around]," acknowledged Alberto
Martinez, owner of La Casita restaurant on Main Street. "But what do we
want to do? Be comfy or successful?"</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Salt Lake City, most large businesses have adopted
flex-time hours to keep business traffic away from the festivals, medal
ceremonies and concerts that are expected to flood many downtown streets
with pedestrians by 3 p.m. each day.</TE>
<TE>   At Inkjetart.com, which supplies artists and photographers all over
the U.S. from a building half a block from the Olympic Medals Plaza,
employees will work from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. But where they will park
remains a problem: The lot owner doubled the rates for February and
leased much of the space for hospitality tents.</TE>
<TE>   Royce Bair, Inkjetart's owner, says the level of security already in
place could result in hours of delays once the Games are underway.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow things are going to have to be streamlined," he said. "Let me
give you an example. Up in the Olympic Village where they have the
dormitories for the athletes, I talked to a gentleman yesterday who works
in maintenance, and he said one of the dormitory people needed an
extension cord. The maintenance people went to take it over, and where it
would normally take that guy in a pickup truck 15 minutes to deliver it,
it took him 2 1/2 hours. Not because of the traffic but because of the
security.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, during the first few days, I don't think people are going to be
quite used to this. I think there's going to be some people who might
miss their venues," Bair said. "I mean, we have to do this. But isn't it
terrible? The terrorists wanted to change our lifestyle, disrupt our
lives, and they have. It's going to take some of the fun out of the
Games."</TE>
<TE>For Ticket-Holders, Delay Will be Constant</TE>
<TE>   Olympic officials have not minced words: Delay will be the order of
the day. Ticket-holders are advised to leave four hours early for skiing
events in Park City, normally a 35-minute drive from Salt Lake.
Interstate 80, which links the two at full capacity with 5,200 cars an
hour, will be handling 6,500.</TE>
<TE>   The Utah Department of Transportation has channeled nearly $89 million
in federal funds for road improvements and designed an elaborate network
of park-and-ride lots and shuttle buses that are intended to provide
almost exclusive access to venues. Still, department spokeswoman Amanda
Covington admits, the system doesn't work unless every car in the
park-and-ride lot arrives with three people in it and unless at least 20%
of normal traffic is lured off the roads.</TE>
<TE>   The nightmare scenario: a big snowstorm like the one that hit Monday.
It dumped 12 inches of snow in four hours on Park City and closed a main
road for several hours--the biggest storm in 25 years. National Weather
Service forecasters said they expect a strong storm to move through
northern Utah beginning Friday--opening day.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way you can plan for that," said Myles Rademan, Park
City's public affairs director. "If it happens, you have to be like Zorba
the Greek. You throw up your hands and you laugh."</TE>
<TE>   The good side was that last week's storm dumped more than a foot of
powder in the mountains--and security teams say the weather could help.
They want a sustained blast of Arctic air, the better to chill any
potential disruption.</TE>
<TE>   "The colder it is, the better it is for us," said a source on the
security team who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The coordinated security effort has drawn praise in recent weeks from
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and Homeland Security Director Thomas J. Ridge,
each of whom has toured the area.</TE>
<TE>   The reality, however, the security team source said, is that there
have been inevitable behind-the-scenes culture clashes and turf battles
among federal, state and local officials--in deciding, for instance, how
to best beef up security in Park City.</TE>
<TE>   "The tough thing about this is putting these people on the ground and
making them work together as a unified force," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Security officials also worry that protests might get out of hand and
drain resources.</TE>
<TE>   Even a peaceful protest is a "significant distraction to law
enforcement forces" the security team source said.</TE>
<TE>   Protest sites have been established, and Mayor Anderson, a former
attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, has been adamant in
insisting that free-speech rights will be ensured.</TE>
<TE>Violent Protests Won't Be Tolerated</TE>
<TE>   The city will be passing out cards to demonstrators with quotes from
Mahatma Gandhi, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez,
reminding them not only of the importance of the 1st Amendment but also
of the "nonviolent" part of civil disobedience.</TE>
<TE>   Already, activists on behalf of the homeless and animal rights
supporters opposed to the Olympic rodeo have signaled their intent to
demonstrate.</TE>
<TE>   "When people cross the line and they intend to disrupt and act out
violently, we are prepared to interrupt that immediately," Anderson said.
"I don't think we're any less civil libertarians if we provide for the
safety and security of people who are here."</TE>

<HD>A New Way of Policing the LAPD</HD>
<DH>Under Parks, the 9,000 officers face 6,000 disciplinary procedures
a year. Critics say morale has suffered; others say reforms are working.</DH>

<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An odd thing happened during Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks' overhaul of the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   Phones began ringing at the offices of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The organization typically fields complaints about LAPD officers. But
now, cold calls were coming in from LAPD officers--charging that their
own civil rights were being violated as a result of new discipline
policies.</LD>
<TE>   For good or ill, something had definitely changed in Los Angeles. The
Police Department legendary for resisting change was being rattled to its
bones by its new ramrod-straight chief.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that change has resulted in improvement is a matter of fierce
debate.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD's rank and file officers keenly feel the effects of the new
system. Their union is waging an all-out campaign to unseat Parks, who
announced Thursday that he will request a second five-year term. Some
civilian critics, meanwhile, question whether scores of personnel
investigations concerning small acts of misconduct are the most effective
means of dealing with more serious problems, such as those revealed in
the Rampart Division corruption investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters say the LAPD is doing something it never did well
before: listening to the powerless.</TE>
<TE>   To understand why discipline is playing such a central role in Parks'
future, it is necessary to understand only one aspect of his complicated
and controversial system: its magnitude.</TE>
<TE>   Put simply, many, many more LAPD officers are subject to disciplinary
proceedings these days than before. Parks himself calls it "a profound
change," one that alters "about 50 years of history."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a workplace in which many if not most employees are facing the
possibility of discipline at any given time, where nearly everyone knows
of someone who has been punished, and where bosses devote almost as much
time to discipline as to supervision. That is the LAPD under Parks.</TE>
<TE>   There are nearly 6,000 complaint investigations initiated yearly
against the LAPD's 9,000-officer force--two for every three officers. The
number of penalties being meted out each year totals on average almost
one per every three officers. In any given LAPD roll call today, there is
likely to be someone in the room who is entangled in some way with the
disciplinary system.</TE>
<TE>   Most complaints against officers involve allegations of minor
misconduct, and a majority result in penalties no more severe than
admonition. Discourtesy, for example, is the No. 1 public complaint
against LAPD officers. The system also processes scores of internal
neglect-of-duty complaints--leaving a shift early, for example, or
getting into a preventable car accident.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders complain that the psychological toll of the disciplinary
system on ordinary officers has resulted in a crushingly negative
employment atmosphere. Supervisors fret that a glum mood stifles
innovation and discourages proactive policing.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Parks' emphasis on off-duty offenses such as domestic
violence, and on lying, has further increased the sense that people are
being scrutinized in highly personal ways. Officers, laments Bob Baker,
vice president of the Police Protective League union, "are just so beat
up."</TE>
<TE>Heavy Workload</TE>
<TE>   The system requires a gigantic, multimillion-dollar bureaucratic
machine to operate. This siphons a substantial amount of supervisors'
time and diverts resources from other functions.</TE>
<TE>   Besides 255 positions budgeted to Internal Affairs, LAPD line
supervisors say they have been spending between a quarter and half of
their time exclusively on discipline investigations in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the department was unable to keep up with the workload until
very recently. Before the policy was changed last year, officers were not
allowed to transfer or be promoted with complaint cases pending. Large
numbers, many of whom had done nothing wrong, were thus caught in career
limbo.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, some LAPD commanders have questioned whether all
this time and effort wouldn't be better spent overseeing officers more
closely, thus averting misconduct that leads to complaints.</TE>
<TE>   There are also worries about the system's potential for misuse. A
persistent concern is that criminals have learned to strike back at
arresting officers by filing misconduct complaints. Internal Affairs
officers tell of allegations involving ex-spouses or lovers of officers
that seem to have more to do with heartbreak, vengeance or custody
disputes than misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Other allegations turn out to be merely frivolous--a citizen
complaining that an officer failed to remove his sunglasses, for
example--but still cost money and time to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   The blizzard of complaints may play into the hands of defense
attorneys, who have been given more leeway to review officers'
disciplinary histories. Such motions have exploded, from 449 requests
involving the LAPD in 1995 to 2,270 last year, creating a huge workload
for city bureaucracies and exposing many more officers' personnel files
to public view.</TE>
<TE>   But for all its difficulties, Parks' system has a key point in its
favor: It has realized important aspects of the vision for the LAPD
spelled out in the 1991 Christopher Commission report.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's landmark study addressed problems in the LAPD after
the beating of Rodney King; it has been viewed as a guiding light for
reform.</TE>
<TE>   A central theme was the notion that there existed in the department a
troubling, widespread culture that tolerated violence.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also chronicled a host of little misdeeds that members
thought provided fertile soil for bigger crimes. There was the coarse and
racist chatter on the patrol car e-mail systems, the winking tolerance of
neglect of duty, the dismissive attitudes toward citizen complaints.</TE>
<TE>Changing a Culture</TE>
<TE>   Such behavior, the report concluded, contributed to a cavalier culture
in which some officers felt they could violate civil rights with
impunity.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Christopher Commission did not lay out specific
mechanisms for disciplinary reform in detail, it made clear that the
department should take minor misconduct seriously and put a premium on
heeding and tracking citizen complaints.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also said it was important to keep track of complaints
against officers even if the officers were found to have done nothing
wrong. Individual citizen complaints are not often proved, but if they
accumulate in patterns, they may still signal something amiss. The union
views this as potentially unfair.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the essence of Parks' reforms is pure Christopher, reflecting
the commission's preoccupation with accountability for both major and
minor misconduct, and with responsiveness to citizen complaints. Other
elements of his system reflect subsequent reform
recommendations--cracking down on domestic violence, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   By design, the system makes Parks the final arbiter of most
disciplinary cases. Complaints against officers are examined either
within the LAPD chain of command or by Internal Affairs investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Command officers recommend penalties using a guide negotiated with the
officers' union last year. The chief makes the final decisions, and in
90% of cases agrees with the recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest penalty Parks can impose is a 22-day suspension. Beyond
this, he must refer cases to a Board of Rights, consisting of two command
officers and a civilian, who have the power to mete out stiffer
penalties, including termination. Parks can sign off on the penalty or
reduce it; he cannot increase it.</TE>
<TE>   The number of cases that end up there are a small fraction of the
total--just 226 last year out of thousands investigated. And of this
fraction, an even smaller sliver end in firings: 32 last year. Another 52
of these Board of Rights cases ended in officers' being found not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   In practical terms, Parks' vehicle for changing discipline has been
Special Order One, adopted in 1998. Deceptively simple on its face, the
idea it contained had power and reach that no one at the time--Parks
included--seems to have anticipated.</TE>
<TE>Complaints Often Ignored</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the LAPD's complaint system allowed desk sergeants and
other low-level managers to apply a high degree of discretion when
citizens complained about officers. The idea was to spend time
investigating only important matters.</TE>
<TE>   But in practice, a see-no-evil, hear-no-evil attitude prevailed.
Complaints deemed unworthy of attention were merely logged or
yellow-sheeted--in the department's lingo--only to be stuffed away in
drawers. If the department didn't want to hear about something, it was
pretty easy to make it go away.</TE>
<TE>   The Christopher Commission cited an especially striking example:
Rodney King's brother showed up at the Foothill Division the day after
the beating to make a complaint but left in frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Parks forced the LAPD to listen.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, all citizen complaints would be booked and tracked and
followed up on by investigators. Desk sergeants would no longer dismiss
farfetched stories or complaints, because in those complaints might lurk
the seeds of the worst police misconduct: the planted gun, the stolen
drugs, the bloodied form of Rodney King.</TE>
<TE>   Special Order One opened the floodgates. Complaints exploded, from
about 1,900 per year in 1997 to the current levels of nearly 6,000 per
year.</TE>
<TE>   Up and down the ranks, officers who had never had complaints against
them were suddenly accumulating disciplinary histories. Fat personnel
files proliferated. Whole offices in the Parker Center headquarters had
to be rearranged to accommodate new file cabinets. Internal Affairs
toiled late into the night.</TE>
<TE>   For some LAPD brass, it was a kind of epiphany.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stunned," said Deputy Chief Michael J. Bostic, recalling how he
was once skeptical of the department's critics. "I had to say, 'You know
what? They were right.' "</TE>
<TE>   It was, says Parks, "absolutely mind-boggling. . . . You look at it
and you say, 'What were we doing with all this stuff before?' "</TE>
<TE>   But other department higher-ups were not so easily converted. Much of
the burden of implementing the system fell to overworked area captains
and lower-level managers first in line to confront officers' anger.</TE>
<TE>   Parks recently backed off a little, agreeing to a kind of triage
approach to taking public complaints and streamlining the handling of
internal ones.</TE>
<TE>   The department says it has cleared much of its backlog, but the
glacial pace of investigations still erodes the effectiveness of the
process.</TE>
<TE>   The number of unsubstantiated complaints against officers suggests
that citizens are not always fair witnesses. By the same token, the
difficulty citizens have proving anything against LAPD officers--just 15%
of public complaints are sustained--continues to trouble civil
libertarians.</TE>
<TE>   But Parks argues that the result still serves ordinary Los Angeles
residents more than politicians or police officers.</TE>
<TE>   To those who fault the system's expense, Parks points to the cost of
two catastrophic Los Angeles riots. Civil unrest didn't flare from
nothing, he contends: Its embers were stoked for years in minority
communities by officers' countless small acts of discourtesy and
disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   "I am trying to create a message that officer integrity is absolutely
essential, that the ability to work with the community is essential, that
accountability is essential," the chief said.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint system "has impacted morale," Parks added. "But do we
[reform] only to the extent that morale is affected? At what point do you
stop--when people don't like it? . . . Think about it. An officer can
alter your life. An officer can take away the two most precious things
you have: your life and your liberty."</TE>
<TE>Results in Question</TE>
<TE>   One key question about Parks' reforms is whether the new discipline
will succeed in remolding the LAPD culture criticized by the Christopher
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence so far is mixed. Some commanders say that, tugged and pinched
by discipline at every turn, the LAPD may be taking a kinder, gentler
form. But there is also plenty of evidence that officers are misbehaving
in the same old ways.</TE>
<TE>   For example, use of force per arrest is now below the level of the
early 1990s, although much of that change preceded Parks' tenure as
chief. There have also been decreases in complaints involving domestic
violence, dishonesty and ethnic remarks. But discourtesy and
excessive-force complaints are up; whether because of police actions or
heightened public consciousness is hard to say. Meanwhile, officers seem
to miss court appointments just as much as always.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the perception that Parks' disciplinary system has permeated
the LAPD is widely shared by insiders.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know how many problems the discipline system has stopped
before they started," said Foothill Division Sgt. Bob Kirk. "But I can
tell you this: The guys think about their actions now. I know they do."</TE>
<TE>   But critics, including some LAPD commanders, fret that fear of
incurring discipline has made officers too tentative to be effective.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are not as aggressive as they used to be," said Terry
Gonzalez, a Neighborhood Watch member and lifelong resident of Boyle
Heights, which has been racked by bloody gang murders of late. She said
gang members in her neighborhood are so emboldened they deride police
with complaint threats and spray-paint patrol cars.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics on field interview cards, a measure of police contacts,
show a sharp initial drop under Parks, but are now starting to go back
up. Arrest data, though, show no clear pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Some civil liberties advocates ask whether the LAPD is missing the
forest for the trees--focusing too much on minor misdeeds and not enough
on major ones.</TE>
<TE>   After all, most pressure to reform the LAPD has come from people
concerned over serious, civil rights-related offenses, such as excessive
force.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Paul Vernon of Internal Affairs said it is the kind of question
the department can't resolve.</TE>
<TE>   "On the inside they say we are way too hard. On the outside they are
saying we are way too soft. Somewhere in between is the answer," he said.</TE>
<TE>Rampart Complications</TE>
<TE>   Numerous officers have been investigated and punished for serious
misconduct in recent years. The job of auditing such investigations falls
to LAPD Inspector General Jeffrey C. Eglash, a civilian.</TE>
<TE>   He has some concerns about uneven quality of LAPD investigations but
said: "The majority of investigations conducted by the department are
thorough and reach the correct result. . . . We generally agree with the
range of penalties."</TE>
<TE>   Far-reaching as they have been, the effects of the new complaint
system on the LAPD constitute only one aspect of change within the
department that has made officers feel hectored.</TE>
<TE>   The Rampart scandal broke shortly after the new complaint system was
introduced, unleashing a new wave of self-examination. New
risk-management policies, which aim to rein in the costs of civil
lawsuits, have brought new scrutiny of officers. A similar effort to
reassign those whose work histories might jeopardize prosecutions has
also created controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, last year, a federal consent decree was accepted by the
city under pressure from the U.S. Justice Department, which stepped in to
protect civil rights. The decree has meant further changes that affect
officers, and will at last kick-start the LAPD's long-delayed computer
system for tracking problem officers.</TE>
<TE>   (The decree, however, leaves core elements of Parks' disciplinary
system alone, to some extent vindicating his approach. On the issue of
complaints, for example, the decree mainly exhorts the department to
continue what it is doing.)</TE>
<TE>   Officers don't like the changes, nor should they be expected to, Parks
said.</TE>
<TE>   He laments that officers have taken things personally, but also calls
poor morale "a fleeting issue." Internal unhappiness over his policies is
the price paid for "the greater good: a product that serves the
community," he said, adding that the disciplinary system "was not
invented for internal personnel. It was invented for the community."</TE>
<TE>Serious Disputes Linger</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't sit well with the union, or with managers who view his
discipline as retaliatory.</TE>
<TE>   But in a further twist, it hasn't endeared Parks to some of the LAPD's
civilian critics either. This is partly because other unresolved serious
disputes over discipline in the department remain, including treatment of
whistle-blowers, criminal prosecution of officers and disclosure of
information to civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Some people have found themselves in the awkward position lately of
asserting that the pendulum has swung too far. A few even contend that
Parks is seeking to destroy reform by embracing it a little too
enthusiastically.</TE>
<TE>   "I call it malicious obedience," said Los Angeles County Public
Defender Michael Judge. He accuses Parks of carrying out his reforms "to
the fullest theoretical boundary . . . to make it so cumbersome that it
will collapse of its own weight."</TE>
<TE>   The irony of being attacked for years for not reforming, only to be
attacked now for reforming too much, is more than some LAPD higher-ups
can take.</TE>
<TE>   "We fully understand that the pendulum will swing back and forth,"
quipped Deputy Chief David Doan, "but now it is like the swinging ax in
the pit."</TE>
<TE>   Even the usually cautious Parks can sound a little exasperated: "I
mean, we did this in six months," he said. "In many instances, we would
be applauded for trying to change something so dramatically."</TE>

<CX>   Clarification--In a story in Sunday's Times about disciplinary
reform under Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, Los Angeles
County Public Defender Michael Judge was quoted as saying Parks might be
engaged in "malicious obedience," carrying out reforms in such a way as
to ensure their demise. Judge said the quote mischaracterized his views.
He was referring to Parks' subordinates, not to the chief.</CX>

<HD>Glowing Putin Book Rings Propaganda Bells</HD>
<DH>Culture: The author of a new biography on the Russian president
denies that the Kremlin ordered positive spin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>From its family tree covering seven generations to its accounts of
precocious athletic prowess, the new biography "Vladimir Putin: A Life
History" is raising eyebrows here for appearing to bring back the Soviet
tradition of writing paeans to the nation's leader.</LD>
<LD>   "I have not read anything like that about anyone since I read about
Vladimir Lenin in school," said a thirtysomething professional, adding
that in the book Russia's current president is "treated like God,
basically."</LD>
<LD>   "The Putin book and the ones about Lenin are identical," said Yuri P.
Shchekochikhin, a deputy in the lower house of parliament, "in that they
create an image of a person totally devoid of all human shortcomings, who
is never afraid and who impresses those around them--from the time they
are in the crib."</LD>
<TE>   The biography, written by Oleg Blotsky, a trained propagandist and
former military journalist, makes the case that Putin was heroic
leadership material from his youth in a cramped communal apartment in St.
Petersburg, then known as Leningrad. Putin, an only child, grew up
virtuous, disciplined and tough enough to take down opponents bigger than
himself.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the 309-page volume's fawning praise and saccharine
reminiscences, something of a more human Putin peeks through.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's future president comes across in its pages as a bit of a
loner, who rarely joined the crowd or stood out in the classroom and for
some reason was not invited to join the Communist Party's equivalent of
the Boy Scouts, the Young Pioneers. In fact, the skinny youth born in
1952 seems more like James Dean, fighting his way up from the mean
concrete "jungles."</TE>
<TE>   Chechen rebels and wayward oligarchs take note: During boyhood, Putin
often found himself in schoolyard brawls, and everyone seems to recall
that he was good with his fists.</TE>
<TE>   According to Blotsky's sources, Putin was so adept at fighting that,
though small in stature, he once decked two loudmouthed drunks minutes
after they stepped from a tram. Another time he attacked someone playing
tag because the larger kid was chasing Putin's friend. And his judo coach
compares the Russian president's moves to those of a snow leopard.</TE>
<TE>   "Vovka has never allowed any scumbag or cheeky fellow to bully and
pick on people and get away with it," childhood friend Nikolay Alekhov
recalls in the book, using Putin's nickname in those days.</TE>
<TE>   Putin acknowledged being unruly in his early years.</TE>
<TE>   "I was brought up in the yard [outside housing complexes]. Living in
the yard was like living in the jungle. Very similar!" he recalled.
"School is some kind of a structured society where clear-cut norms of
behavior exist. But when a person is brought up in the jungle, then for a
while one continues to live by the law of the jungle."</TE>
<TE>   He fought frequently, he admitted in an interview with the author, and
his schoolyard battles taught him two lessons important in later life:
"You must be ready to retaliate immediately for any offense against you"
and "to win any fight you must go to the end, and fight as if it is your
last, decisive battle."</TE>
<TE>   Blotsky's book is the first major biography of Russia's enigmatic
leader, and it reads at times like a parody of propaganda from another
era. At least that is what critics hope it is--and not a sign that the
bad old days are coming back.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were the president, I would never allow such a book to be
published," said Pavel I. Voshchanov, a onetime spokesman for former
President Boris N. Yeltsin who is now a newspaper commentator. "This is a
typical Soviet throwback--neither a novel nor a biography but some kind
of a servile panegyric done in the worst Soviet traditions."</TE>
<TE>   Blotsky, who has covered the fighting in Chechnya for the Moscow daily
Izvestia, said he gained access to Putin through presidential aide Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, the spokesman for Russia's military campaign in the
separatist republic. Blotsky is a graduate in special propaganda from the
Moscow Military Foreign Languages Institute and has worked for several
newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Blotsky says the book was his idea, driven by how little was known
about Putin when he became president two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference last month, Blotsky said that the book will be
the first of three parts and that he is planning to start work on the
second volume, which will be titled "The Road to Power." He is hoping
that Yeltsin will cooperate in describing how he made Putin his protege
and successor.</TE>
<TE>   Blotsky denies any suggestion that the Kremlin ordered him to write a
flattering biography. He also said it was only because of his passing
acquaintance with Yastrzhembsky that he was able to get the first of
"five or six" interviews with Putin--plus meetings with Putin's wife,
Ludmila. Blotsky said he once talked with the first lady for eight hours
straight.</TE>
<TE>   Voshchanov, for one, was skeptical of Blotsky's claim that the book
was not the Kremlin's idea. "I don't see how this book could appear
without the consent of the president," Voshchanov said.</TE>
<TE>   But Alexander Gavrilov, editor of the weekly Knizhnoye Obozreniye, or
Book Review, said he found merit in the work, though he did not believe
everything in it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a good biography written by an honest journalist who likes
President Putin and doesn't conceal it. Some critics may say that it is
too servile, but I won't agree," Gavrilov said. "But the problem is that
if you ask a school principal about Putin's school performance and his
conduct, how can you expect him to say that Putin got bad grades and was
a hooligan? Of course the principal will say that he was the conscience
of the school and only beat up the bad kids."</TE>
<TE>   The book is divided into 35 "stories," most of them recollections
about Putin and influential people in his life, written in simple,
credulous language.</TE>
<TE>   Putin does seem to have been highly disciplined. After having received
average grades at a high school specializing in chemistry, he earned
entry into the elite St. Petersburg University knowing that a law degree
would make him attractive to his future employer, the KGB. In the
entrance exams, Blotsky reports, Putin earned a B in literary composition
and an A in all other subjects.</TE>
<TE>   The book also sheds light on how joining the spy agency became Putin's
ambition when he was still a teenager. Blotsky suggests that Putin was
under the spell of a popular 1965 novel, "Shield and Sword," glamorizing
a fictional KGB agent, Alexander Belov. Like Belov, Putin would study
chemistry and German, and stand out as methodical, athletic and a paragon
of self-control.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he admired the book, Gavrilov said parts of it defy
credibility, such as the incident in which an anonymous student pops up
and recalls in detail what happened when Putin received a birthday
present from the teacher four decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "When you read such episodes, you just can't help feeling that they
have been made up," Gavrilov concluded.</TE>

<HD>China Scholar Gets 13 Years, Activists Say</HD>
<DH>Asia: Hong Kong-based historian is sentenced for releasing
classified papers and illegally selling books on the mainland, according
to rights group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Chinese authorities have sentenced a Hong Kong-based historian to
13 years in prison, according to a human rights group, in the harshest
sentence meted out to any of a group of academics arrested in a crackdown
on alleged spying.</LD>
<LD>   A municipal court in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, which borders
Hong Kong, sentenced Xu Zerong on Tuesday for providing classified
historical documents to unspecified overseas parties, according to the
Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy.</LD>
<LD>   Three years of the sentence were for illegally selling books on the
mainland, where many Hong Kong publications with political content are
banned. Xu, 46, plans to appeal the verdict to a provincial court, the
center said Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The documents apparently pertained to Chinese military operations
during the Korean War and to how the Communist leadership decided to
enter the conflict in 1950.</TE>
<TE>Korean War Files</TE>
<TE>   Although some U.S.-based Chinese scholars have obtained copies of
important Korean War-related materials, the subject remains highly
sensitive in China, and even official academics' access to such documents
is severely restricted. In recent years, North Korean diplomats have
protested Chinese scholarly articles that have bucked the party line by
claiming that the Communists started the war.</TE>
<TE>   Before his detention in August 2000, Xu, a permanent Hong Kong
resident, was an associate research professor at the Guangdong Provincial
Academy of Social Sciences and an affiliated professor at Zhongshan
University, where his mother is believed to have been president for a
time.</TE>
<TE>   He "had a gift of foresight, and he was bolder than most mainland
foreign students," said Byron Weng, a political scientist who was among
Xu's professors at Chinese University of Hong Kong. "He started research
into political topics very soon after China began its reform and opening
policies."</TE>
<TE>   Known in English as David Tsui, Xu earned his master's degree at
Chinese University and also studied at Harvard. He received his doctorate
in 1999 at Oxford University in England, where his dissertation was on
the Chinese army's role in the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   "His approach to the subject was wholly scholarly; and he used a range
of sources in a manner that conformed to the highest academic standards,"
Oxford scholars wrote in April to the Chinese ambassador in London,
protesting his arrest.</TE>
<TE>Magazine Launched</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Oxford to return to Hong Kong, Xu founded the
Chinese-language Chinese Social Sciences Quarterly to introduce the work
of Western scholars to China. The magazine frequently contained articles
considered too politically sensitive for mainland publication.</TE>
<TE>   Although U.S. officials have pressured Chinese leaders to release
U.S.-based academics, Xu "was not affiliated with any institution that
could back him up," Weng said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, before visits by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and
President Bush, China convicted and released four other academics who
were either U.S. citizens or permanent residents.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech last month in Hong Kong, U.S. Ambassador to China Clark T.
Randt Jr. indicated that human rights will be high on Bush's agenda
during his state visit to China this month. Randt specifically mentioned
two other detainees with ties to the U.S., both of whom have since been
freed. He did not bring up Xu's case.</TE>

<DL>SHIBAOZHAI TEMPLE, China
</DL>
<LD>For 500 years, Shibaozhai has sat on a hillside overlooking a
crowded medieval village and the terraced green fields of the narrow
Yangtze River valley.</LD>
<LD>   It has survived civil war and the relic-smashing fanatics of the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution. But now the 12-story Taoist temple faces a
new threat from the reservoir that will soon start to fill behind the
massive Three Gorges Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Chinese government engineers have a novel protection plan: a 33-foot
thick concrete dike that will turn the temple into a tiny island within
the vast man-made lake.</LD>
<TE>   The plan is part of a $125-million push to save thousands of relics
threatened by the world's largest hydroelectric project.</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for moving hundreds of old stone bridges, pagodas and
temples that sit along a river that was a major shipping route for more
than 2,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   Ancient tombs and prehistoric campsites are also to be excavated
before the flood waters arrive June 2003. These could hold clues into the
origins of one of the world's oldest civilizations--and human evolution
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing is calling it the biggest historical salvage operation ever.
But many experts still fret that it is too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese government didn't start paying for large-scale
preservation until 1999, after pressure from home and abroad.
Archeologists say that hasn't given them enough time to excavate even a
tenth of about 800 known sites--not to mention those yet undiscovered.</TE>
<TE>   "It would take 500 years to find all the archeological treasures in
the Three Gorges," said Sun Hua, a Beijing University archeologist
leading one of the digs.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing has rejected requests to delay the reservoir's start date,
partly out of concern over the controversy that surrounds the $25-billion
project.</TE>
<TE>   The government calls the dam necessary to prevent deadly floods and
generate clean power for economic development. But it will displace 1.13
million people by the time its 411-mile-long reservoir finishes filling
in 2009.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also fault it for doing irreparable damage to the environment
and wiping out priceless clues into China's past.</TE>
<TE>   For some of the objects that can't be moved, novel preservation plans
are afoot. One proposal calls for building an underwater museum reached
by an enclosed walkway to see ancient calligraphy carved into cliffs by
imperial poets.</TE>
<TE>   At Shibaozhai temple, the reservoir will reach the first story.
Planners say relocating the red-painted wooden structure is impossible
because of its unique construction directly into the hill. The
$10-million dike will keep the temple dry within a shallow concrete well,
but curators have misgivings about its new island setting.</TE>
<TE>   "It will never be the same," said Zheng Xiannong, deputy director of
the government office that now runs the temple, near the city of
Zhongxian in the central region of Chongqing.</TE>
<TE>   At greater risk are the far more ancient objects on the Yangtze's
banks. Critics say too few of the people digging there have professional
training, leading to the damage or inadvertent discarding of valuable
artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   And with China viewing the Three Gorges Dam as a symbol of national
prestige, few foreign experts have been allowed to help preservation
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Looting has also been a headache. Thieves armed with cell phones and
metal detectors found a 2,000-year-old suit of armor and a bronze
candelabra called the "Spirit Tree" that sold for $2.5 million at a New
York auction in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Still, tens of thousands of relics have been saved, including
gold-plated tables and chairs, jade swords and bronze spear points and
daggers. Many artifacts date to China's oldest dynasties.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular interest is evidence about the Ba people, vanquished by
imperial Chinese armies more than 1,600 years ago. Archeologists hope to
solve the riddle of how the Ba built the boat-shaped coffins that still
hang high in the gorges of Yangtze tributaries, and learn the truth of
ancient legends that they sacrificed humans to tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Even more intriguing are the fragments of jaws and teeth first found
in 1985 near Wushan, a city sitting in the reservoir's path.</TE>
<TE>   Some Chinese scientists contend they belonged to human ancestors who
lived along the Yangtze 2 million years ago. That has given rise to
theories--rejected by non-Chinese scholars--that homo sapiens appeared in
Asia at the same time or even before Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many things we may never know now. It's a terrible,
terrible loss," said Harvard University scholar Deirdre Chetham.</TE>

for Somalia's shaky administration from opposition warlords, escaped

<LD>The Zimbabwean government backtracked dramatically on its sweeping
media control laws, indicating that they will not be imposed immediately
and may not be enforced at all, a state-run newspaper reported.</LD>
<LD>   The Herald newspaper, quoting an unidentified government official,
said that it will take time to fund, staff and equip the media commission
and that the Department of Information will not be able to "preoccupy"
itself with such a task because President Robert Mugabe started his
campaign Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say the media bill and new security laws were aimed at
stifling dissent ahead of presidential elections next month.</LD>

<HD>Czech Nostalgia Has Some Seeing Red</HD>
<DH>Culture: An upbeat revisionist view of the country's communist past
is called inaccurate, even dangerous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ONDREJ HEJMA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic
</DL>
<LD>A bust of Lenin with a bashed-in skull adorns the newly opened
Museum of Communism, where visitors can imagine being interrogated by
police beneath a single bulb in a bare-walled chamber.</LD>
<LD>   The museum in downtown Prague reflects a new trend: Twelve years after
the Velvet Revolution brought down communism, many Czechs seem obsessed
with reexamining the darker aspects of their totalitarian past.</LD>
<LD>   More to the point, they are debating whether the old demons might
return to haunt their future.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Czech Republic belongs to NATO and is well on the road to
membership in the European Union, recent opinion polls suggest that one
in two Czechs thinks he or she had a better life under the communists.</TE>
<TE>   Such nostalgia can be downright dangerous, other Czechs warn.</TE>
<TE>   "We should avoid making the old regime prettier than it was. It was a
miserable regime," said Pavel Tigrid, a former chancellor to President
Vaclav Havel.</TE>
<TE>   It's a legacy that Czechs can't seem to escape.</TE>
<TE>   In November, a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Vlastimil Protivinsky,
faced charges of disseminating hateful ideologies for calling the Czech
Communist Party "evil" during the 1998 election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   When the news hit the media, Havel swiftly intervened to grant amnesty
to the priest, and the justice minister fired the investigator handling
the case--a former member of the STB, the communist regime's dreaded
secret police.</TE>
<TE>   Activists and politicians launched a "Stop Communism" campaign warning
that democracy was in danger.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation was stopped, but . . . the iceberg of communist
thinking remains hidden beneath the surface," the group's petition said.
"Our democracy can be shipwrecked by that."</TE>
<TE>   Ten-percent of Czechs were dues-paying members of the Communist Party.
Thousands worked for the secret police. Others were members of the
communist youth union, trade unions or militia.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of our citizens . . . in a way collaborated with the regime, or
at least tolerated it," said Havel, the playwright turned president who
led the crusade against communism and remains the country's respected
moral authority.</TE>
<TE>   When the communists were peacefully toppled in 1989, Czechs started
building a new system.</TE>
<TE>   Pragmatically, they focused on economic reform rather than past crimes
and punishment. But although the business world remained open to
everyone, high-level functionaries and police under the communists were
banned from posts in the state administration.</TE>
<TE>   Promoting communism was declared illegal, but the party itself was not
banned. Today, communists are the third-biggest bloc in the 200-seat
Parliament, where they hold 24 seats, and party membership is 120,000,
though it has been slowly declining.</TE>
<TE>   And although the Czech Republic became a member of NATO in 1999,
thousands of former comrades who left the party after the revolution
survive in the lower ranks of the army, police and judiciary.</TE>
<TE>   The government, eager to make an example of those it accuses of
communist-era crimes, brought charges last year against former Interior
Minister Jaromir Obzina, ex-Prime Minister Lubomir Strougal and former
Communist Party chief Milos Jakes. They face up to 15 years in prison if
convicted on abuse of power or treason charges.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is worried about a communist resurgence.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever something serious happens that has to do with our ugly past,
the public reaction is immediate and absolutely healthy," said Martin
Fendrych, a commentator for the weekly magazine Tyden, referring to the
case of the priest.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many Czechs are nagged by the question of whether communism
could reassert itself.</TE>
<TE>   Havel often points to a persistent "communist mentality" that he says
is reflected in xenophobia and corruption caused by decades of isolation
under the totalitarian regime.</TE>
<TE>   "The fear of communists returning will always be with my generation,
because we are still unable to spell out what happened and settle scores
with the past," said Karel Michl, 60. "It must be similar to what Germans
felt after the war."</TE>
<TE>   Optimists are confident Czechs remain wary of communism.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not fear the return of communism," said Pavel Drazan, 48, a
filmmaker. "Every form of evil has its time. Our time brings new forms of
evil such as terrorism."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Photo Show Is a Shrine to Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Arts: Visitors find a visceral connection. Chicago hosts an
offshoot of the exhibit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURIE GARRETT</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A World Trade Center photography exhibit created after the Sept. 11
attacks has been trying to shut its doors since Thanksgiving, but cannot
stop the hordes of viewers who demand it remain open.</LD>
<LD>   The SoHo exhibit, "Here Is New York: A Democracy of Photographs," has
become a shrine of sorts, drawing 3,500 New Yorkers and tourists each
day, as people search for some way to connect emotionally with the
tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   "People go to ground zero and there's nothing left to see," exhibit
publicist Amy Wentz said. "So we're finding most of the people who come
here now are tourists. This sort of allows them to bear witness."</LD>
<TE>   Michael Shulan is a co-founder of the exhibit, as well as co-owner of
the Prince Street storefront that houses it rent-free.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit was created after Shulan and three other local artists and
photographers realized that thousands of New Yorkers, some of them
professional photographers, had documented Sept. 11 and its immediate
aftermath. They decided to create a vehicle for donating and archiving
the best of those photos.</TE>
<TE>   Practically overnight their tiny storefront space was deluged with
photos and with volunteers such as Wentz, who lives near Ground Zero.
About 300 people have given their time to the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Now, 4,000 images are on display, either on their Web site,
www.hereisnewyork.org, or at the exhibit--many hanging on clips, attached
to strings that dangle across the space. All the photographers have
waived their rights to the pictures. There are no names on the pictures,
and nothing distinguishes the images by famous photojournalists from the
shots by amateurs.</TE>
<TE>   A traveling version of the exhibit opened in Chicago on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit sells prints of the images for $25 each, with all profits
donated to the Children's Aid Society. About $500,000 has been raised so
far to assist children who lost parents in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Top sellers include a photo shot from inside a destroyed building
across the street from the Twin Towers, with the broken window frame
forming a crucifix.</TE>
<TE>   On a typical afternoon in January, the New York gallery was packed,
with a long line of people waiting patiently outside in the crisp air.
Inside, people seemed compelled to talk, in English and an assortment of
other languages, about what they were seeing and to share Sept. 11
stories. Many were moved to tears.</TE>
<TE>   "If you weren't here you feel cut off from what happened," said
co-founder Charles Traub, chairman of the master of fine arts photography
program at the School of Visual Arts. "And New York is like a child of
the world."</TE>
<TE>   Traub likened seeing the photos to recovering the bodies of the lost,
saying it makes the attack seem real.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people don't want to let go of the experience," he said. "And
my dream is that because of that, the American public will be all the
more mindful of those things that happen all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   The nearly renovated Tweed Courthouse, located next to City Hall,
would like to house the archive, Traub said, but hasn't the funds to
properly store and display it. Several galleries have expressed interest
in housing the work from famous photojournalists, but that, Traub
insists, would destroy the exhibit's point.</TE>
<TE>   Target, the department store company, is sponsoring shows drawn from
the exhibit in Chicago and three other cities. This month, 300 of the
images will travel to several cities in Germany. And 40 cities worldwide
have requested the exhibit. But the organizers don't have experience in
corporate fund-raising, and day-to-day operations are so overwhelming
that nobody has figured out what ought to be done next.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the chaos and the long hours of work, Traub said, the
experience has created a family.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what the firefighters feel--the brotherhood," Traub said,
admitting it will be hard to break up the volunteer team. "They are
inspired by what took place, and by having a means of contributing. It's
a remarkable case study in collective energy."</TE>

<HD>Troubled Current Under Surface of U.S.-Saudi Ties</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Both sides have grievances that have sparked a
tit-for-tat row over the presence of 5,000 mostly American troops in the
kingdom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
</DL>
<LD>The government of Saudi Arabia is about to ask the United States to
withdraw its troops from the kingdom. Or maybe not. The United States is
looking to move its forces out of Saudi Arabia. Or maybe not.</LD>
<LD>   Confused? You're not alone.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, U.S.-Saudi relations
have been subject to greater scrutiny than perhaps at any time in nearly
seven decades of cooperation. But more than four months later, although
many people in both camps say they feel betrayed, their
leaders--President Bush and Crown Prince Abdullah--insist that relations
are just fine.</LD>
<TE>   "Our relations with America and in particular with its government
headed by President George W. Bush are excellent," Abdullah, the de facto
ruler of the world's largest oil exporter, said in comments published
recently in Saudi newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Riyadh and Washington both view the alliance as necessary to preserve
regional stability. Despite their efforts to put the best face on the
partnership, both sides have grievances that have sparked a tit-for-tat
row over the future of the Prince Sultan Air Base.</TE>
<TE>   Many in this conservative Islamic society are openly angry about U.S.
support for Israel, while some U.S. officials have questioned the Saudis'
willingness to help in the fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The bruised feelings have focused on the air base, home to about 5,000
mostly U.S. troops based there since the Iraqi invasion of neighboring
Kuwait in 1990. More than 10 years later, the base appears to be anything
but temporary, with a high-tech command center that served as the
logistical headquarters for the air campaign in Afghanistan against the
Taliban and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   At least one Western diplomat acknowledged that the base has become a
sore point in relations between the two countries. "It is a military
presence the Saudis see as inimical to their interests," said the
Riyadh-based diplomat, who spoke on the condition that he not be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict has heated up in recent days: Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.),
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, suggested that the
United States pull its troops out of Saudi Arabia. Quick on the heels of
Levin's remarks, an anonymous Saudi official told the Washington Post
that the U.S. would be asked to leave because it has "overstayed its
welcome."</TE>
<TE>   Then, even as leaders on both sides insisted that there was no
substance to the latest controversy, the U.S. military lifted a mandate
that female personnel at the base obey the Saudi law requiring women to
be cloaked in a black gown and to wear a head covering in public.</TE>
<TE>   The decision followed a lawsuit by a high-ranking female fighter pilot
who opposed adhering to the many restrictions placed on women here. But
many people in Saudi Arabia said they doubt that its timing was a
coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, Saudi Arabia's Presidency of Promotion of Virtue and
Prevention of Vice--a government-funded office--warned that the dress
code "also applies to foreign women."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of the base has caused tremendous anxiety for both
governments, in part because removing U.S. troops from Saudi soil has
been one of Bin Laden's key demands.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden, stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994 for opposing the
leadership, has been accused by the U.S. of masterminding the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. Neither the U.S. nor the Saudis want to appear to be
kowtowing to extremists and are very cautious when addressing the issue
publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S.A. troops came during the liberation of Kuwait by a decision
of the political leaders, and it was approved with the support of the
ulama [religious council]," Salah al Sheik, the Saudi minister of Islamic
affairs, said in a recent interview. "There is no harm to having them
here in the future as well, because they come according to our wishes and
it is approved by our leaders."</TE>
<TE>   There is widespread hostility to the troops at all levels of Saudi
society, although not necessarily on religious grounds. Some said in
interviews that they are angry that their government has spent so much
money on its own military, yet it still needs U.S. protection. Others
argued that the U.S. is using Saudi Arabia to promote its imperial
interests in the region, and giving Saudi Arabia nothing but grief in
return.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we get from this?" asked a prominent businessman in the port
city of Jidda who, like many people in the kingdom, spoke on the
condition that he not be identified for fear of angering authorities. "It
is all about America's interests."</TE>
<TE>   But these are not issues that the leadership chooses to focus on--not
now, anyway. In August, Abdullah--who assumed day-to-day operations after
King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1996--wrote to Bush saying that the
kingdom may have to rethink its relationship with the U.S. because of
Washington's support for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In recent remarks made while visiting Kuwait, the crown prince said,
"Our relations with the American people are excellent, contrary to what
is carried by the hired media, and we say the caravan will move forward."</TE>
<TE>   The news reports didn't elaborate on what he meant by "hired media,"
but other news reports in the kingdom have referred to the
"Zionist"-controlled media in the United States. There is an effort to
promote the theory that U.S. news reports about strained relations are
part of a conspiracy by a Jewish-controlled media to limit Saudi Arabia's
ability to help the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S.-Saudi relations are strong enough not to be affected by this
media campaign that is attacking Saudi Arabia," said Miassar Shammari,
the Riyadh-based political editor of the pan-Arab newspaper Al Hayat. "If
we want to look and see who is benefiting from this media campaign, we
realize that the party to most benefit from it is the Zionist entity, and
this is because of the role of Saudi Arabia in the Israeli-Palestinian
struggle."</TE>
<TE>   This idea of a Jewish media conspiracy appears to be widely held. "In
some circles, especially those with strong ties to Israel, they have
found this unique opportunity to attack Saudi Arabia because it is
showing great support for the Palestinians," said Abdulaziz bin Salamah,
a former Saudi ambassador to UNESCO. "I am not speaking from passion, but
from facts."</TE>

<HD>190 French Troops Arrive in Kyrgyzstan to Help With Base</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan
</DL>
<LD>A first contingent of 190 French troops arrived in Kyrgyzstan on
Saturday, joining an advance U.S. team to help set up a base that will
house thousands of coalition troops waging war in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. and French troops are stationed at Manas air base 22 miles
from Bishkek, the capital. Kyrgyzstan is one of three former Soviet
republics in Central Asia that allowed in Western troops after the Sept.
11 attacks on the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   French air force spokesman Col. Saster Kochanowski said in Bishkek
that the first 190 French troops included doctors, cooks, engineers and
other support staff. He said 200 more French troops would arrive by the
end of February with six Mirage fighter planes.</LD>
<TE>   Two hundred Americans arrived in December to begin building the base,
which will eventually house 3,000 mainly U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, which considers the former Soviet states in Central Asia as
its own backyard, has so far not objected to the deployment of the
Western troops. But many Russians wonder why the U.S.-led coalition is
building new bases in the region nearly two months after the Taliban was
routed from Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation in Afghanistan is very tense. All bastions of
resistance must be wiped out; therefore, we will have warplanes,"
Kochanowski said.</TE>

<HD>115 Students Held, Questioned About Ties to Radicals in Yemen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen
</DL>
<LD>Authorities have detained 115 foreign students for illegal
residence and questioned them about links to radical Islamic groups, an
Interior Ministry official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The students--from Britain, France, Egypt, Algeria, Indonesia,
Pakistan, Sudan, Libya and Somalia--used to study in religious schools in
various parts in Yemen, the official said on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   They were arrested during the last four months and none had been
charged so far, he said. He did not provide specific figures on the
nationalities of the detained students.</LD>
<TE>   The authorities were sharing the information obtained from the
students with the United States, said a diplomat, who also spoke on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Saturday, Indonesia described the arrest of 43 students from
the country as unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "We are deeply concerned about the treatment of our students who were
unreasonably arrested," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wahid Supriyadi said.
"The Yemeni authorities are watching hard-line Muslim learning
institutions very closely and unfortunately some of our students were
studying there."</TE>
<TE>   Muslim nations--including Yemen and Indonesia--have been under
pressure to crack down on religious extremists linked to various militant
groups since the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the United States. U.S.
officials say terrorist groups are active in at least 50 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia has formally complained to the Yemeni government over the
long delay in announcing the arrests of the students and their "improper
treatment," Supriyadi said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has been pushing Yemen for greater anti-terrorism
cooperation since the October 2000 suicide bombing of the U.S. destroyer
Cole.</TE>

<HD>E-Mail Targets 9/11 Victims' Families</HD>
<DH>Response: Reports of huge payouts to relatives of those killed in
the terrorist attacks have prompted angry messages from unknown senders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SAUL</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than five months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New
York and Washington, a backlash of venomous e-mails and begrudging
attitudes is hitting families of the victims.</LD>
<LD>   This new negativity appears to stem from reports of how much money
families may receive from a federal compensation fund, which itself has
prompted complaints that families won't be compensated equitably.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Push, treasurer of the organization Families of September 11,
said last month that his group has received about 30 vitriolic messages
via e-mail.</LD>
<TE>   "Every time I go on TV, or I'm quoted in the press as criticizing the
regulations, I get a handful of e-mails from people saying, 'Steve Push,
you greedy . . . you should rot in hell,' " he said. Push's wife,
biotechnology lobbyist Lisa Raines, was on the hijacked jet that crashed
into the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Feinberg, the compensation fund's special master, has
estimated that average payments will be $1.65 million, a figure that
often gets prominent mention in reports about the fund.</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg's average compensation figure, however, does not take into
account the deductions of so-called "collateral offsets" such as life
insurance, pension benefits and Social Security payments. According to
Push and others who have analyzed the plan, those deductions are likely
to greatly reduce the average payment for some families.</TE>
<TE>   The backlash against victims' families also emerges in some of more
than 2,000 letters and e-mails filed with the Department of Justice
during a public comment period on the compensation fund.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Feinberg, you can't give in to these greedy people," reads one
message, purportedly from an ex-wife of a victim who complained that the
victim's new wife would get too much money. "Enough is enough. Stick to
your guns. You'll disappoint me if you give in to pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Another critic wrote, "It makes me sick to think that all these great
men and women who were just doing their jobs are being remembered by
greedy family members trying to get paid for their death."</TE>
<TE>   Names aren't included on the Justice Department Web site where the
comments are posted.</TE>
<TE>   Push said complaints about the compensation plan by his group and
others, as well as Feinberg's promotion of it, seem to have prompted the
backlash.</TE>
<TE>   "When people think we're going to get $1.65 million and we're still
complaining, they think we must be greedy," he said. "What they don't
realize is that many families are going to get much less.</TE>
<TE>   "The typical victim is a widow at home with two young children who's
been out of the labor market for five years," Push said. "She's going to
be lucky if she has $40,000 a year to spend. Yeah, she could sell the
house and move into an apartment. She could put the kids in day care and
get a job. Why should she have to do that in order to subsidize the
airline industry?"</TE>
<TE>   Push said that the compensation plan, created in an act of Congress as
part of an airline-bailout package, was created largely to shield the
airline industry from lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg, who is expected to release final details of the plan this
month, said, "I think this backlash is extremely unfortunate. The
families don't deserve this."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), who has urged generous benefits for the
bereft spouses of World Trade Center workers, said he too has received
ugly messages.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are some very decent people who probably feel too much
money is being given out," King said. But he called many of the messages
and phone calls he's received "irrational begrudgery."</TE>

<HD>Bin Laden Interviewer Was Under Duress, TV Station Says</HD>
<DH>Media: Al Jazeera cites questions imposed on its reporter in the
tape it withheld. The video was broadcast on CNN.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates
</DL>
<LD>An influential Arab television station said Saturday that it never
aired an October interview with Osama bin Laden because the interview was
conducted under duress and the questions were dictated to its
correspondent.</LD>
<LD>   The statement from Al Jazeera was the latest round in a rift between
the satellite outfit and CNN over the Bin Laden interview. Al Jazeera
objected when CNN began airing the video, and a CNN official fired back,
saying the cable network had done nothing illegal and Al Jazeera should
explain why it hadn't made the tape public in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   That explanation came Saturday in a faxed statement to Associated
Press.</LD>
<TE>   Last fall, CNN and Al Jazeera submitted written questions for Bin
Laden via members of his Al Qaeda network, Al Jazeera's statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days later, Al Jazeera's correspondent Tayseer Allouni, was told
he must cover an important event. He was blindfolded and taken by armed
men to interview Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "The correspondent received a list of questions that were imposed on
him, and only a few of them were the ones CNN and Al Jazeera submitted,"
the statement said. "The interview, in which Allouni was subjected to
intense psychological pressure, made it difficult to accomplish it
professionally."</TE>
<TE>   The statement said Allouni was told to air the interview in full or he
would be harassed.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera received the interview Oct. 21 via satellite in its offices
in Kabul, Afghanistan, the statement said. Station officials decided not
to air it, "since the circumstances under which it was conducted did not
represent the minimum limit of objectivity and professionalism."</TE>
<TE>   The Arab station's statement said CNN obtained the tape in an "unknown
way and aired it without Al Jazeera's approval and without explaining the
circumstances of the interview."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, CNN said it had received the 60-minute interview through
unspecified unofficial channels. According to CNN, Al Jazeera accused the
American network of obtaining the tape illegally and said it would sever
the information-sharing relationship between the two.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame that it came to that," CNN chief news executive Eason
Jordan said Friday, "but once the tape came into our hands, it would have
been journalistically irresponsible to ignore it."</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera is a 24-hour station owned by Qatar's government but known
for a fairly independent editorial line. It reaches more than 35 million
Arabs, including 150,000 in the United States.</TE>

<HD>Unmanned Planes Face Threats From Near, Far</HD>
<DH>War: The drones' future is challenged by plans to make them so
costly that they won't be expendable and by spy satellites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In Afghanistan, unmanned aircraft have come as close to being war
heroes as machines can get. They are providing invaluable reconnaissance,
damage assessment and other intelligence information. Some have even hit
enemy targets. All at zero risk to American pilots.</LD>
<LD>   Despite their increasing acceptance by a once-skeptical military,
however, unmanned aircraft will be hard to find when the Pentagon unveils
its new budget Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the future of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, is menaced
by two of the oldest enemies of military effectiveness in the book:
bureaucratic competition from older, entrenched interests; and Pentagon
planners' tendency to gold-plate anything that moves.</LD>
<TE>   UAVs, close to revolutionary when first deployed in the Afghanistan
war, are now so much a part of U.S. military operations that when two
crashed in the last 10 days, no one paid much attention.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Secretary James G. Roche calls the increased reliance on
UAVs "a cultural breakthrough."</TE>
<TE>   But their ability to perform vital missions while safeguarding
American lives does not guarantee that UAVs will be used to their full
potential.</TE>
<TE>   First, in the twisting, turning world of competitive defense programs,
when an innovative new system wins, other more traditional systems lose.
Senior officers and others whose careers are tied to established programs
tend to defend them against upstart rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to widespread belief outside the Pentagon, it is not die-hard
fighter pilots who feel threatened by UAVs. "I've seen that silly horse
being ridden," says one senior flight officer. "There's nobody that
thinks UAVs might endanger us in terms of our jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Rather, it is the intelligence community that feels the breath of
robotic aircraft on the back of its neck, particularly the impenetrable
empire of super-secret spy satellites.</TE>
<TE>   The other danger to using UAVs to their fullest comes, ironically,
from their friends, and is linked to the drones' increasing
sophistication. Pentagon planners already are larding on new
"requirements" for future UAVs: stealth capability, heavier payload,
better engines, greater endurance, even armor.</TE>
<TE>   Military planners often seem incapable of thinking in anything but
"worst case" terms. That may sound prudent, but as one analyst says, "You
don't buy an entire military that is able to operate in your worst-case
environment."</TE>
<TE>   Building every system to handle the worst case raises the cost.
Greater cost inhibits greater use. And the very attractiveness of UAVs is
that they are expendable.</TE>
<TE>   Before the advent of global positioning systems, the effectiveness of
unmanned aircraft was limited by the fact that, most of the time, they
just didn't know precisely where they were.</TE>
<TE>   GPS has solved this problem. What's more, industry sources say,
although technical problems still cause UAVs to fail more often than
manned aircraft, the reliability gap is closing.</TE>
<TE>   Five unmanned aerial vehicles have been "killed" in action during the
Afghanistan war; two were lost over Iraq in the same period. The Defense
Department now has 90 UAVs in the field, high and low altitude, long and
short range, each an enormous improvement over yesterday's technology.</TE>
<TE>   Two high-end systems have been the mainstays in Afghanistan: the
General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. Predator and the Northrop
Grumman Corp. Global Hawk.</TE>
<TE>   Predator is hand-flown by a "pilot" on the ground, using a stick and
rudder pedals to maneuver the vehicle. Global Hawk has a pre-programmed
flight path but can receive updated directions.</TE>
<TE>   Both scan the ground to collect a variety of imagery--from streaming
video to synthetic aperture radar data, which yields three-dimensional
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Although the CIA has employed its own version of the Predator to fire
missiles, what makes UAVs so revolutionary is that they can linger over
the battlefield for more than 24 hours, providing constant coverage of a
potential target. Global Hawk has a 36-hour flight time.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, UAVs get only the most modest boost in the Pentagon's new
budget. Global Hawks will be built at double the planned rate for the
next two years, and the Navy is embracing the system. Twenty-two of the
60 existing Predators have been lost in crashes; the new budget is
expected to contain funds to purchase eight new ones a year, only one
more than last year's plan.</TE>
<TE>   But even with such shots in the arm, a number of defense industry
analysts think that the priorities for the future are wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Take Global Hawk: The Air Force plans to buy four a year, though the
production line could build 12. And the military bureaucracy is
generating costly new "requirements."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of ordering ever-more-costly versions, some analysts say, the
Pentagon should build a fleet of present-day drones and learn to use them
as relatively expendable assets.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a fleet of 100 Global Hawks in close to their current
configuration would allow virtual 24-hour coverage of multiple hot spots
anywhere on the globe. With a cost of about $25 million per drone and a
total program cost of $2.5 billion, commanders could feel comfortable
using them whenever needed.</TE>
<TE>   Senior military officers say that what really set Predator and Global
Hawk apart in Afghanistan is that Gen. Tommy Franks, the Operation
Enduring Freedom commander, "owned" them. He and his air war commander
decided where the UAVs went. And the drones got the intelligence product
directly into their command centers.</TE>
<TE>   At $3 million per Predator, the cost of losing one was low enough to
have them loiter over Kandahar or other locations, looking for Taliban
and Al Qaeda leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for the 21st century, Air Force Secretary Roche says, is
to "find moving targets" and "have persistent intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   Why not just use space satellites? They don't tend to crash, and their
technical capabilities are legendary. With imagery satellites, however,
"tasking" is a cumbersome and competitive process of claiming space on a
limited national system that must serve many customers. Also, the current
imagery satellites only pass over the same spot on Earth about every
three days.</TE>
<TE>   Because they fly about 300 miles above the Earth, says Jeffrey
Richelson of the National Security Archive in Washington, a leading
expert on spy satellites, about 30 satellites would be needed to provide
constant coverage of any one spot.</TE>
<TE>   Given the cost of an advanced KH-11 satellite--about $1.5 billion,
Richelson says, with an additional $300 million cost to boost each
satellite into orbit--such a force would cost about $54 billion. That's
more than 20 times the cost of the 100-strong Global Hawk force, with far
less flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike satellites, UAVs and their sensor packages can be modified and
given new equipment to meet changing needs.</TE>
<TE>   The cost and other advantages of UAVs are sure to be pressed hard in
the enormous debate that has begun since President Bush reopened the
Pentagon's coffers for the war on terror. According to the Defense
Department's April 2001 "Roadmap" for UAV development, "UAVs may offer
increased efficiencies in operations and support costs due to the reduced
need to actually fly pilot proficiency and continuation training
sorties."</TE>
<TE>   UAVs currently suffer accidents at 10 to 100 times the rate of manned
aircraft. But for every hour flown by a UAV, military aircraft fly 300
hours; that's because 95% of a manned aircraft's flight time is for air
crew training.</TE>
<TE>   UAV operators get most of their training in simulators, at
significantly less expense.</TE>
<TE>   Given that "force" is the Air Force's last name, it shouldn't be
surprising that, although Predator and Global Hawk have been stars
because of their surveillance duties, enthusiasm is shifting toward
another system, the Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle, or UCAV.</TE>
<TE>   If deployed at the end of the decade, UCAV would be the first true
unmanned bomber, able to go into the most lethal air defense environment
without fear of U.S. casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Roche and others are truly taken with this capability. One senior
commander in Enduring Freedom said that, with current (and future)
Stealth aircraft, such as the F-22, under development along with UAVs,
the military will be able to operate with acceptably low casualty rates
against any postulated enemy.</TE>
<TE>   But that assumes the UAV will remain cheap enough and simple enough to
use routinely.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to lose the ability to just throw it away," one
analyst says. If it gets too precious for that, he says, "then you won't
take risk to actually fly it where it's needed."</TE>

<HD>Fate of Abducted U.S. Reporter Is Still Unclear</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Fruitless search of cemeteries in Karachi rekindles hopes
that Daniel Pearl might still be alive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>A nervous uncertainty surrounded the fate of American journalist
Daniel Pearl on Saturday, with no apparent communication from his alleged
kidnappers and no trace of his whereabouts after three separate police
searches for his body in this turbulent port city.</LD>
<LD>   The searches were triggered Friday night by an e-mail--allegedly from
Pearl's abductors--claiming that the 38-year-old Wall Street Journal
reporter had been killed and his body thrown "in the grave yards of
Karachi." The chilling message, the fourth purportedly from the
kidnappers received by U.S. and Pakistani media organizations, was sent
to Fox and CNN.</LD>
<LD>   Provincial police Inspector General Syed Kamel Shah said authorities
had carried out three separate fruitless searches of Karachi's 300-odd
cemeteries since late Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "Nothing has been found," he told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of any such discovery rekindled hopes that, contrary to
the fears that dominated the mood here Friday, Pearl might still be
alive--that the message declaring his death, like reports Friday of a
ransom demand, was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on reports from Pakistan, we now believe that both of the
messages received yesterday about Danny were false," said Paul Steiger,
managing editor of the Journal. "We continue to believe that Danny is
alive. Yet, we have not heard from Danny's captors in two or three days."</TE>
<TE>   Still, through much of Saturday, it was evident that the only
certainty was the continued confusion about the journalist's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have anything," added Lonnie Kelley, a spokesman for the
U.S. Consulate in Karachi. "We're waiting, hopefully for the kidnappers
to release Danny."</TE>
<TE>More Suspects Detained in Probe</TE>
<TE>   Pearl disappeared 11 days ago on his way to an interview in Karachi.
The first e-mail apparently from his kidnappers contained four photos of
him and a variety of demands, including one for the release of Pakistani
prisoners now being held at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
That and subsequent messages labeled him variously an American or Israeli
intelligence agent.</TE>
<TE>   Shah said that additional suspects in the case were detained during a
raid Friday on a house in Karachi. The house is believed to have
contained a computer on which at least one of the four e-mails related to
the case was composed and sent.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing solid to say, but I think we are making
headway--progress toward getting some clue," Shah said. "We are
interrogating these people."</TE>
<TE>   His comments came as authorities appeared to have completed their
questioning of Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, once the prime suspect.
Gilani heads a militant group in Karachi and is the person Pearl was on
his way to meet when he disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was investigating reports of a possible link between Gilani and
alleged "shoe bomber" Richard C. Reid, who has been charged with trying
to ignite explosives embedded in his shoes aboard a Paris-to-Miami
commercial airliner Dec. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the Pearl case said that questioning Gilani had led
both the Pakistani police and the FBI to conclude that he had no role in
Pearl's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   There also were reports Saturday of new e-mails claiming to relate to
the case, but authorities appeared to be treating them as hoaxes.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances surrounding Pearl's disappearance have had an impact
on scores of American journalists based in Pakistan to report the
aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four e-mail messages included direct or veiled death
threats against U.S. journalists. The most chilling came Wednesday, in
the second missive: "We warn all Amreekan journlists waorking in pakistan
that there are many in their ranks spying on pakstan under the journlist
cover. Therefore we give all amreekan journalists 3 days to get out of
pakstan. Anyone remaining after that will be targetted."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the e-mail announcing that Pearl had been killed added that
"now we are thirsty for the blood of another American."</TE>
<TE>U.S. Journalists Not at Risk, Minister Says</TE>
<TE>   However, Pakistani Information Minister Anwar Mehmood scoffed at any
suggestion that U.S. journalists are under threat, and he said his
ministry would not change a policy he described as "absolute freedom in
Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   "I have not received any communication" threatening foreign
journalists, Mehmood said. "There has been this very unfortunate incident
involving Daniel Pearl, but other than that, there have been no threats.
We have had more than 3,000 journalists here since Sept. 11, and they
have had no problems. . . . No harm was ever done to a foreign
journalist. What does that signify? There is no generalized threat to
journalists."</TE>
<TE>   On the streets of the nation's capital, Islamabad, on Saturday, some
people expressed sympathy for Pearl while others resorted to dark humor.
Spotting a journalist holding an American passport, one man quipped:
"I'll take you to an interview. Do you want an interview with Bin Laden?"</TE>
<TE>   At the passport agency in the capital, an official who requested
anonymity said he had seen Pearl on Jan. 21, two days before his
disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   "He was standing right at this window," the man said, showing the
registry with "Daniel Pearl, correspondent for the Wall Street Journal"
typed beside his request for a 15-day extension.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very sad," he said. "I don't understand. If they write e-mails,
why can't they trace these people?"</TE>

<HD>Young Man With No Legs Compensates With Big Heart</HD>
<DH>Lifestyles: College student inspires others with a can-do attitude.
'Life is just a big mind game,' he says. 'If you think you can do it, you
can do it.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BLAKE NICHOLSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BOTTINEAU, N.D.
</DL>
<LD>Erik Blada's view of the college campus is from waist level as he
scoots from building to building on an old wooden skateboard that has
seen better days.</LD>
<LD>   For Blada, who was born with no legs and a deformed right arm, every
trip is an opportunity--a chance to prove to himself and others that he
can do whatever he sets his mind to.</LD>
<LD>   "There's always somebody telling you you can't do something. It
doesn't matter who you are," he says. "Life is just a big mind game.</LD>
<TE>   "If you think you can do it, you can do it. If someone tells me I
can't, I'm going to do my darndest to do it."</TE>
<TE>   That charge-ahead attitude has left Blada so unfazed by his disability
that he has not even bothered to find out the name for it. He and his
family simply accepted it as a birth defect and moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Seated comfortably on a couch in the student center at Minot State
University-Bottineau, his trusty skateboard parked nearby, Blada seems
wise beyond his 19 years.</TE>
<TE>   He cannot ever remember wishing he had legs, or feeling sorry for
himself.</TE>
<TE>   He hunts. He bowls. He competes regularly in snowmobile drag races
across the Upper Midwest and Canada. He even won a championship last fall
at the Western Canadian Shootout in Saskatchewan on a snowmobile equipped
with special handlebars. He drives a van equipped with hand controls.</TE>
<TE>   His take on life is simple: Live it while you can.</TE>
<TE>   "If you start feeling sorry for yourself, you let your body start
shutting down, and then where do you go?" he says. "It's so easy to go
down, but so tough to get back up."</TE>
<TE>   He seems no different from any other freshman.</TE>
<TE>   He has a full course schedule. He zips down sidewalks on a skateboard
that he says "has been to the moon and back." He opens doors and ascends
stairs with ease. The thick gloves on his hands are worn and dirty and
need replacing about once a month, but the smile on his face never seems
to wear out.</TE>
<TE>   Blada lives in Kramer, a town of about 50 people in north-central
North Dakota. He is known to everyone on this small junior college
campus.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone who has a positive outlook on life like he does can't help
but have a positive influence on everyone he comes in contact with," says
Ken Grosz, the campus dean. "Remarkable is the word."</TE>
<TE>   Blada's roommate, Matt Olson, is often amazed at his buddy's eternal
optimism and boundless energy.</TE>
<TE>   "He's crazy, he's off the wall, he doesn't let anything get to him,"
Olson says. "He does everything he wants to do. He enjoys every minute of
life."</TE>
<TE>   Blada says his life has never really been difficult because he has
never let it, even when he was a child. He drove all the machinery on his
family farm as a youngster, and first hopped on a snowmobile when he was
about 6 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really not scared of anything," he says. "I've never let anything
bother me. Pretty much in one ear and out the other. You just handle the
situation you're in. Everybody's got problems; it's just how you deal
with your problems."</TE>
<TE>   While growing up, he took teasing from other youngsters in stride
because, he says, "everybody gets their time when they get teased." By
the time he was in high school, he was beating his peers in snowmobile
races.</TE>
<TE>   "It would bother them sometimes--'A kid with no legs beating me,
that's not right'--but it was all in good fun," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Blada says growing up in a rural town with few people helped him gain
acceptance. His mother, Connie, says her son's upbeat attitude is
important.</TE>
<TE>   "One time we went to a basketball tourney--he must have been 3 or
4--and we were sitting in the stands and he says, 'Oh, Mommy, I can't
wait until my legs grow,' " she says. "We talked about 'Your legs won't
grow,' and he never had any problems with it.</TE>
<TE>   "Thinking about it almost broke my heart, but he's always been very
upbeat about it," she says. "Anything he's wanted to do, he'll try to
find some way to figure out how to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Blada came up with the skateboard idea while in high school. He got
tired of hauling around his wheelchair on trips to the mall in nearby
Minot.</TE>
<TE>   "You can put this anywhere, and away you go," he says, motioning to
his constant companion.</TE>
<TE>   After classes, he does what freshmen do: enjoy "the night life," he
says with a smile on his face and slight raise of his eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   He notices the stares he gets in public places, but he brushes them
off.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain people catch my attention too," he says. "We're all guilty of
doing it."</TE>
<TE>   His goal in life is to be a motivational speaker. He already has
talked to a Boy Scout troop, and says he'll sit down and talk with just
about anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy speaking, trying to help other people with their problems,"
he says. "My problems are minimal compared to some other people. I would
rather help somebody else than have them help me."</TE>

<HD>Terror War Expansion Troubles Allies</HD>
<DH>Germany: At security forum, U.S. officials sound drumbeat for
campaign against 'axis of evil.' But the effort goes too far for
Europeans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MUNICH, Germany
</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials put the world's defense chiefs on notice Saturday
that the war against terrorism may soon target Iraq and other states in
an "axis of evil," intensifying fears that Washington is carrying its
campaign to avenge the attacks of Sept. 11 too far for its allies.</LD>
<LD>   European lawmakers and defense chiefs at the annual Munich Security
Conference couched their reservations in polite diplomatic language, but
they made clear that they see the Pentagon's go-it-alone tendency as
alienating trusted European friends and undermining improving ties with
former enemies.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush's reference in his State of the Union message Tuesday
to the "axis of evil" spanning North Korea, Iran and Iraq was repeatedly
evoked by U.S. officials at the prestigious security forum here as they
sounded a drumbeat for extending the war against global terrorism. But
since the term "axis" once referred to the troika of Washington's World
War II enemies--Germany, Italy and Japan, now all close U.S. allies--it
has given offense to some and caused fear in others.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. delegates, led by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz,
warned that Washington is committed to stepping up its campaign to
eradicate terror whether or not its European allies are willing to do
their part.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened on Sept. 11, terrible though it was, is but a pale
shadow of what will happen if terrorists use weapons of mass
destruction," Wolfowitz said. Declaring a need to catch the enemy
unawares, he said: "We are at war."</TE>
<TE>   Hammering home a message of you're-with-us-or-you're-against-us,
Wolfowitz also told the nearly 300 security strategists from 43 countries
that their governments confront a clear choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Those that stand for peace, security and the rule of law--the great
majority of countries in the world--stand united with us in this struggle
between good and evil," he said. "Those countries that choose to tolerate
terrorism and refuse to take action--or worse, those that continue to
support it--will face consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "Make no mistake about it: If they do not act, America will,"
Wolfowitz warned.</TE>
<TE>   Quoting his boss, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz said
self-defense "requires prevention and sometimes preemption."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican and former U.S. presidential
contender, further fueled expectations that an expansion of the war might
be imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "We in America learned the hard way that we can never again wait for
our enemies to choose their moment," he said of the Sept. 11 attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. "The initiative is now ours, and
we are seizing it."</TE>
<TE>   McCain repeated Bush's "axis of evil" reference and said nowhere is
the need for action more apparent than in Saddam Hussein's Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The next front is apparent, and we should not shirk from
acknowledging it," McCain said. "A terrorist resides in Baghdad, with the
resources of an entire state at his disposal, flush with cash from
illicit oil revenues and proud of a decade-long record of defying the
international community's demands that he come clean on his programs to
develop weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Amid such talk, even some of Washington's strongest supporters here
recoiled at the implied criticism of European allies in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has largely been sidelined in
America's war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Lamers, the German lawmaker in charge of foreign policy for the
conservative Christian Democrats, expressed dismay Saturday at the U.S.
position, saying: "It cannot transpire that you decide and we simply
follow. We must be heard."</TE>
<TE>   Long an unflinching supporter of U.S. policy in Europe, Lamers said
after the opening session of the two-day conference that he was "outraged
and speechless" at Bush's resurrection of the loaded term "axis" and the
U.S. officials' attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some words you just don't use, like 'axis' and 'crusade,' "
Germany's coordinator for U.S. relations, Karsten Voigt, commented on the
sidelines of the conference. He was putting "axis" in the same category
as Bush's verbal faux pas after Sept. 11 when the president called the
war against terrorism a "crusade," recalling the bloody religious
campaigns waged across Europe and the Holy Land during the Middle Ages.
European allies have taken pains to avoid casting the drive to eradicate
terrorism as a war against Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov also expressed dismay at
menacing words directed at North Korea, Iran and Iraq--all nations with
which Moscow has long-standing trade and political ties.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen no evidence to suggest North Korea, Iran or Iraq supports
terrorism," Ivanov told reporters after a separate meeting with
Wolfowitz. Their tete-a-tete typified the corridor diplomacy that has
made the Munich conference an important event in the drafting of
international defense plans.</TE>
<TE>   While Italian delegates refrained from making an issue of the "axis"
allusions, commentators in Italy were miffed.</TE>
<TE>   "Unilateralism has become personified--the superhuman Bush versus the
axis of evil," wrote Vittorio Zucconi in Rome's La Repubblica.</TE>
<TE>   Both North Korea and South Korea also have criticized the reference,
with Seoul warning that such comparisons could torpedo its efforts to
achieve a rapprochement with the North, and Pyongyang calling Bush's
words "little short of declaring a war."</TE>
<TE>   British lawmaker Menzies Campbell weighed in here with a warning that
European allies would want to see "incontrovertible evidence" that Iraq
was plotting a terrorist strike before engaging in preemptive aggression.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz stressed to the delegates the need for U.S. allies to
upgrade military technology to shoulder more of the collective defense
burden. But he also noted that the United States will continue to look
toward "flexible coalitions" to combat terrorism around the
world--hinting that NATO has little relevance in campaigns far from its
traditional sphere of operations, like the recently deployed anti-terror
force in the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the massive police cordon around the conference, which is
being held in an elegant central Munich hotel, hundreds of antiwar
protesters ignored a ban on demonstrations but were contained by police
and in any case were too far removed for the participants to notice them.</TE>

<HD>Flame Retardant Raises Red Flag for Some Scientists</HD>
<DH>Health: The chemical PBDE is used to treat some plastics and foam
furniture padding. But it's permeating the environment, including
mothers' breast milk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT CRENSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A chemical flame retardant commonly used in foam furniture padding
is accumulating so rapidly in the breast milk of nursing mothers that
environmentalists and some scientists are calling for a ban on it.</LD>
<LD>   Little is known about the toxic nature of polybrominated diphenyl
ether, commonly known by the acronym PBDE. Early studies show it poses
some of the same dangers as PCBs and DDT. Those two chemicals were banned
in the United States decades ago for their myriad detrimental effects on
animal and human health.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists advocate a ban on PBDE as well. One form of the
chemical will be banned next year in Europe, where the law requires proof
of safety before a new agent can be used in the environment. U.S. law
requires proof of harm or risk before a chemical is banned.</LD>
<TE>Weighing the Risks and the Benefits</TE>
<TE>   But the chemical industry argues that more research is needed before
banning something that protects lives. Producers of PBDE say there is no
evidence that it will ever reach harmful levels, while its benefits as a
flame retardant are well known.</TE>
<TE>   Adding PBDE to foam furniture padding, television casings and other
plastics reduces by 45% the risk of death and injury due to fire, the
chemical manufacturers say.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about aesthetics. People use brominated flame
retardants because they save lives," said Robert Campbell, a spokesman
for Great Lakes Chemical Corp. in West Lafayette, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Like PCBs and DDT, PBDE is a persistent organic pollutant, or POP.
POPs can remain in the environment for years without breaking down. Some
of these pollutants have such an affinity for fat that they build up in
the bodies of both animals and humans from before birth until death.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems that PBDEs are an important--but generally
unrecognized--persistent organic pollutant in the United States," Robert
C. Hale, a professor at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences, and
five colleagues wrote in the journal Nature a few months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Persistent organic pollutants are so difficult to purge from the
environment that, 25 years after being banned, trace amounts of PCBs can
still be measured in our blood. Waterways such as New York's Hudson River
and Wisconsin's Fox River are being dredged at costs running into the
hundreds of millions to rid them of PCB contamination. In many waters,
anglers are warned not to eat the fish they catch, or to limit their
consumption to one or two servings a month.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an enormous need to act quickly when there is a problem with
a chemical that is not only toxic but is persistent and accumulates,
because it will continue to get worse before it gets better," said
physician Gina Solomon, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources
Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   Industry uses several forms of PBDE to decrease the flammability of
various plastics. Only one of those types--used mostly in polyurethane
foam furniture padding--has been found in the environment and breast
milk. According to Environmental Protection Agency records, Great Lakes
Chemical is the only U.S. manufacturer of that form of PBDE.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, all bets are open in terms of how it's getting into
the environment," said Hale, who stops short of calling for a ban on the
pollutant, which was developed in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   He has hypothesized that discarded furniture is a major source of PBDE
in the environment. Whenever anybody tosses out an old sofa, he
explained, nature goes to work. Water and sunlight break the foam into
crumbling pieces that eventually are ground to dust. Insects have also
been observed munching away at the material. From those humble beginnings
the chemical travels all the way up the food chain to humans.</TE>
<TE>   Hale has found PBDEs virtually everywhere he has looked: In a small
river along the North Carolina-Virginia border, he found fish with the
highest levels of PBDE ever recorded in an animal. He has also collected
sewage sludge samples from four states, all with high concentrations of
PBDE.</TE>
<TE>   Swedish scientists first documented the increase of PBDE in humans.
For 30 years, Sweden has sampled the breast milk of nursing mothers to
track exposure to dioxin, PCBs and other pollutants that accumulate in
body fat. The United States has no similar program.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Swedish scientists reported that levels of PBDE in breast
milk had increased 40-fold since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Swedish discovery, the chemical has been found in Swedish
pike, Virginia catfish and North Sea cod. Seals, moose and reindeer all
carry PBDE in their body fat and like humans, transmit it to their
nursing young. PBDE has even been found in the blubber of sperm whales in
the Arctic Ocean, far from any possible source of the chemical.</TE>
<TE>   Even more alarming to environmentalists was the revelation in December
by the journal Environmental Science &amp; Technology that North American
mothers have breast-milk PBDE levels at least 40 times the highest
concentrations found in Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   "It's humongously high," said Mehran Alaee, a Canadian government
scientist who compiled the North American data. "If you let it go like
this, it will reach a point sooner or later that it will cause some
damage to the environment."</TE>
<TE>   Where that point lies, nobody knows. Researchers simply have not
collected the information they need to determine how much PBDE is
harmful.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have seen in our developmental neurotoxicity studies . . . is
that PBDEs can be as toxic as the PCBs," said Per Eriksson, a
toxicologist at Uppsala University in Sweden.</TE>
<TE>Brain Damage Seen in Animal Studies</TE>
<TE>   Eriksson's experiments have shown that one large dose of PBDE
delivered early in a mouse's life can cause permanent brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   Similar experiments by Per Ola Darnerud of Sweden's National Food
Administration have determined that, in mice, the smallest dose of PBDE
that can cause observable health effects is about 1 million times greater
than current human exposures.</TE>
<TE>   But those experiments both involve relatively large amounts of PBDE
given to animals over a short time. Nobody really knows how lower doses
delivered over decades will affect humans.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping that within two to three years we'll have an answer," said
Kevin Crofton, a toxicologist with EPA's National Health and
Environmental Effects Research Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with similar uncertainty in May 2000, the 3M Co. chose to remove
another POP, known as PFOS, from Scotchgard and several other products.
Like PBDE, PFOS had been found to persist in the environment, but little
is known about its toxic effects.</TE>
<TE>   Users of PBDE could do the same, substituting another flame-retardant
chemical in its place. But PBDE has properties other flame retardants
don't, Campbell said. It does not discolor foam or decrease its
durability as much as other flame retardants do. And though all flame
retardants evaporate into room air in trace amounts, PBDE does so at
lower levels compared to many alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, Great Lakes Chemical has chosen to continue producing
its PBDE products for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   "If things turn out that the levels that are going to get into the
environment are problematic, we'll do the right thing," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>European Officials Take Action</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, environmental authorities have already decided that PBDE
warrants action. Beginning next year, the PBDE variety that has shown up
in breast milk is banned. The European Parliament may end up banning the
other types as well, because some research suggests that they can break
down into the more pervasive variety after being released into the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   European environmental law relies heavily on the precautionary
principle, which dictates that any time a human activity may pose a
threat to the environment, it should be banned until it can be proven
safe. In the United States, regulators must show harm or an unreasonable
risk before a ban.</TE>
<TE>   It probably will take a few years for scientists to figure out how
much of a threat PBDE poses to human health. Then the chemical industry
and government can decide if PBDE should remain in sofas and car seats.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what they decide, Americans will continue living many years
with a stubbornly durable pollutant that has an inevitable attraction to
the human body.</TE>

<HD>Sport of Kings Is Rethinking Castles</HD>
<DH>Kentucky: With racing revenue off, horse interests push for casinos
even at blueblood venues such as Churchill Downs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.
</DL>
<LD>The moment Albert Clay says the words, he takes them back. He has
just spoken of thoroughbred racing as "the sport of kings." Now he rushes
to amend.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the wrong term," says Clay, who breeds horses here in
Kentucky's fabled bluegrass pastures. "That gives the impression that
everyone in racing is rich."</LD>
<LD>   Clay means the phrase to evoke instead an image of horse racing as a
noble sport--rich in tradition, refined, classy; a sport for
connoisseurs. But that's an image the thoroughbred industry may no longer
be able to afford.</LD>
<TE>   For the sport of kings in Kentucky has fallen on hard times--and is
counting on 25-cent slot machines, neon lights and plastic token cups to
bail it out.</TE>
<TE>   As state lawmakers opened their legislative session last month, horse
industry lobbyists began pushing for a bill to let them build casinos at
racetracks--adding Las Vegas glitter to such famed blueblood venues as
Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, or the ivy-clad Keeneland
race course here in Lexington.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing Double Wild Cherry slots to a place like Keeneland (which
bans denim from several of its grandstand restaurants) may sound like
heresy, acknowledges David Banks, who runs a local stable. "But if you
increase your bottom line by huge amounts, you can swallow the heresy a
little easier."</TE>
<TE>   And boosting the bottom line is urgent business for the Kentucky horse
industry.</TE>
<TE>   A mysterious disease that struck pregnant mares last spring killed
more than 5,000 horses in the state, wiping out one-third of the foals
that would have been born this season.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the recession has hit the industry hard, dampening bidding at
auctions. At Keeneland's Breeding Stock Sale in November, perhaps the
most closely watched auction in the nation, the average price for horses
was down 20% compared with the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, slot machines in neighboring states are attracting Kentucky
gamblers in droves, soaking up cash that might otherwise be wagered at
the races. Indiana and Illinois have authorized half a dozen casinos
along the Ohio River, which borders Kentucky. Among the recent arrivals:
Caesars Glory of Rome, billed as the world's largest riverboat casino and
located just minutes from Churchill Downs. Last year, Kentuckians spent
more than $350 million gambling on the riverboats.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most devastating blow, however, has been the slipping
prestige of the Kentucky racing circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby states such as West Virginia and Delaware permit slot machines
at their tracks--and pour the proceeds into prize money for the races. In
Indiana and Illinois, tracks get a cut of riverboat casino profits to
bestow on winning horses. The fatter purses draw top horses to these
states--and away from the Kentucky circuit.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three years, the average number of horses starting each
race at Churchill Downs has dropped from nine to eight because of such
competition, according to track President Alex Waldrop. Fewer starters,
in turn, translates to fewer bets. And less wagering means lower purses,
setting the whole cycle in motion again.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill Downs has been able to make up for reduced wagering by
selling the rights to simulcasts of its races, so its purses are down
only slightly in recent years. But at Turfway Park, a less prestigious
track in northern Kentucky, the average daily payouts have sunk nearly
40%. Meanwhile, purses in West Virginia and elsewhere continue to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this litany of woes, most of Kentucky's tracks still are
turning profits. Owners, however, see only gloomy portents ahead.</TE>
<TE>   And that has prompted some radical rethinking.</TE>
<TE>   "Popular opinion has always been that we don't need to tarnish racing
by involving it with alternative forms of gambling," says trainer John
Ward, who prepared Monarchos for last year's Kentucky Derby win. "But now
we're being threatened."</TE>
<TE>   So what once was perceived as tarnish is starting to look a lot like
salvation. "We're no different than a Wendy's restaurant trying to sell a
different type of hamburger," Ward says. "We need to continue to
diversify."</TE>
<TE>   Or as veteran breeder John R. Gaines puts it: "Racing has been out of
touch with reality for too long."</TE>
<TE>   In truth, many horsemen began coming around to this view a decade ago,
when tracks here moved to simulcast races from around the country. The
simulcasts swiftly proved popular--and profitable. On a typical Saturday,
Keeneland might handle $500,000 in bets from folks watching California or
Florida races on banks of televisions above the grandstand.</TE>
<TE>   Keeneland's elegant grandstand might have been designed, as the media
guide boasts, "to cultivate an enduring appreciation and respect for the
noble sport of horse racing." But the success of simulcasting stripped
away any pretense that it was the live pageantry, the thrill of
thundering hooves, that drew most fans to the track.</TE>
<TE>   They were just as happy--happier, even--to sit in a drab room and
wager while snacking on nachos, watching the races unroll on TV, stirring
now and then to let out a cheer: "C'mon, baby! C'mon, baby! Pick it up!"
Waiting for a simulcast to start one recent afternoon, 55-year-old Wayne
Barnett, a mechanic, said he couldn't understand why anyone would fuss
about placing slot machines at the races. "Both of them are about luck."</TE>
<TE>   Famed horse breeder William T. Young, who charges a $500,000 stud fee
for his top stallion, is equally pragmatic. "We have to face up to it: No
one comes to the races except to gamble. There's no home team to root
for. One race looks pretty much like the next. If you closed the
parimutuel windows, you wouldn't have an audience."</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that truth, industry leaders make a point of saying that
they are in the entertainment business, competing with other gambling
venues, not with other sports. They insist that they can put slot
machines at the tracks without making the whole venture look tawdry. And
they believe doing so will bring new fans to racing. As proof, they point
to Woodbine, a track in Toronto that has combined racing and casino
gaming with considerable success.</TE>
<TE>   At Woodbine, "betting coaches" roam the casino area offering vouchers
worth $2 to novices willing to try wagering on the horses. Even if they
stick to the slots, however, patrons are giving the local horse industry
a boost with every quarter they play. The Canadian track used $38
million--about $22.6 million U.S.--in slot machine profits to increase
racing purses last season. Much of the prize money was designated for
horses bred in Canada; as a result, at least one Kentucky breeder now
trucks his pregnant mares across the border just before they give birth
so the foals can be eligible for Woodbine's bounty.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky's racing leaders long to copy Woodbine's model. But it will
be hard sell, and they know it.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Paul E. Patton has said he's inclined to favor slot machines at
the tracks. (Part of the profit would go to the state treasury.) Two of
the state's biggest business groups also have endorsed the idea. The
Kentucky Council of Churches, however, is lobbying hard against expanded
gaming.</TE>
<TE>   And some lawmakers are warning that, if they do open the state to
casinos, the tracks will not be able to monopolize the slots. If
mini-casinos start popping up everywhere, they note, the tracks could end
up in worse shape than they are now.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics also resent how the industry keeps citing the Mare
Reproductive Loss Syndrome as a blow that they need help in overcoming.</TE>
<TE>   The epidemic was indeed devastating; estimated losses topped $335
million. But Kentucky is a farm state, accustomed to the vagaries of
agriculture, and critics say the tracks should not use the disease as a
pretext to cry poor.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, horse racing is a tough row to hoe, but so is dairy farming,"
says the Rev. Nancy Jo Kemper, pastor of a church in the heart of horse
country. "We've been losing a dairy farmer a day [as small farms
founder]. Does that mean we should put slot machines right next to the
milk?"</TE>
<TE>   State Rep. Bob Damron, a Democrat, echoes all those arguments as he
talks through the travails of Kentucky horse racing while driving home
from the state Capitol one evening. Then he pauses and adds one last
consideration:</TE>
<TE>   "Kentucky has always been known as a place where you can see horse
racing as it's meant to be."</TE>
<TE>   Look at the elegance of Keeneland, Damron urges. Look at the
ivy-covered limestone walls, the tree-shaded drives, the white picket
fences. Keeneland exudes nobility. It sets a standard for the industry
that is the symbol of Kentucky. It whispers: This is the sport of kings.</TE>
<TE>   "I just cannot imagine that facility," Damron says, "with the glitter
of slot machines clanging in the background."</TE>

<HD>Drought Looms for Parched East Coast</HD>
<DH>Weather: An unusually dry stretch has forced officials,
particularly in New York City, to think about conserving water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>It was an irresistible Manhattan moment: On a winter's day when New
Yorkers reveled in warm weather, snow was falling in Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   But smugness here over the region's unusually dry fall and winter
slowly has given way to the realization that the Big Apple and much of
the Eastern Seaboard, from Georgia to Maine, face a major drought.</LD>
<LD>   Blame it on the summerlike temperatures that persisted through
October, the mild holiday season that brought little or no rain and an
unusual weather system that kept snowfall from collecting on the ground.
More than 100 counties now are under drought warnings, and forecasters
looking at future weather patterns say there is little or no relief in
sight.</LD>
<TE>   "The drought situation has to be taken seriously," said Solomon
Summers of the National Weather Service's eastern region. "If we don't
get four to five major storms back to back, we're going to be in a
critical stage this summer."</TE>
<TE>   The Eastern Seaboard is normally soaked in winter and spring by
nor'easters--storms with heavy rain and snow that form when frigid arctic
air from Canada blends with warm, moist air currents flowing up from the
Gulf of Mexico. Yet there have been virtually none of them this year,
Summers noted.</TE>
<TE>   Rainfall totals over the last six months are 6 to 10 inches below
normal in New England and the Middle Atlantic States, forecasters say,
and are barely 25% of normal in New York City. The unusual weather
patterns were expected to continue through this weekend, with
temperatures in some areas as high as 60 degrees, then plummeting to more
winterlike numbers by early next week.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, we're very, very low on rainfall through this entire
part of the country--lower than anything we've seen in years," Summers
said. "The point is not to frighten anyone. But drought conditions may
worsen."</TE>
<TE>   In Baltimore, reservoir levels are dropping, and city officials are
planning to tap the nearby Susquehanna River for drinking water, even
though many residents have complained about its bitter, metallic taste.
Rivers in Maine, normally full this time of year, have slowed to a
trickle. New Hampshire's frozen waterfalls, usually a tourist magnet for
ice-climbers, have been slow to form this year. And the Delaware Basin
River Commission in New Jersey has been operating under emergency
conditions for a month.</TE>
<TE>   The water shortage is particularly acute in New York City, which last
week issued a drought warning. Officials said there was less than a 33%
chance that the city's five upstate reservoirs would reach normal levels
by June 1. New York City's water system is usually at 80% capacity in
February, but now it is only 41.5% full, officials said. It is the lowest
recorded water level in the metropolitan area since 1960.</TE>
<TE>   "There are not a lot of storms on their way as far as we can tell, so
this is a problem that is probably going to get worse," New York Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference Monday. "The question now
is: What can we do about it? And conservation of water is the answer."</TE>
<TE>   As the mayor spoke, the temperature rose to 62 degrees in Central
Park. Cherry blossoms began sprouting on a day when New Yorkers ate lunch
at outside cafes in their shirt sleeves; others flocked to Long Island
beaches and boardwalks to soak up the warm January sun.</TE>
<TE>   Under the city's drought warning, New Yorkers are being urged to
conserve water at home. Cutbacks are scheduled for the parks and
sanitation departments, and New York will require the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority to reduce the washing of its vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Although average daily water consumption in the city has steadily
declined from 1.45 billion gallons in 1991 to 1.2 billion gallons today,
city and state officials are preparing a major public relations campaign
to educate residents about the threat of drought and how to avoid it.</TE>
<TE>   New York has lived through drought warnings before. In the late 1970s,
Mayor Edward I. Koch jokingly urged residents to conserve water by
"showering with a friend." Bloomberg, more circumspect, offered his own
shower tips: "Get in, turn it on, get it to the right temperature, lather
up, get rid of the soap and get out," he said. "If you can cut the length
of time of your shower in half, it really would make a big difference."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond showers, New Yorkers will be asked to restrict their use of
washing machines, refrain from excessive washing of automobiles and to
clean sidewalks in front of their homes with brooms instead of water
hoses.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg and other officials hope New York can avoid declaring a
drought emergency, in which officials impose mandatory restrictions on
water use for businesses and millions of residents.</TE>
<TE>   If the situation gets truly dire this summer, officials noted, New
York might be compelled to blend purified water from the Hudson River
with reservoir water.</TE>
<TE>   Despite growing concerns, the worsening drought does not seem to have
registered yet with many residents. As New Yorkers bundled up against a
misting rain--the prelude to a storm front that swept in over the weekend
but was not expected to improve the drought situation--the likelihood of
future water emergencies was not exactly a hot topic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not thinking about it much," confessed a banker on a lunch break
near Herald Square, opening an umbrella. "I mean, it's wet out here."</TE>
<TE>   Their attitudes may change as the drought intensifies, said Joel
Miele, the city's environmental protection commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of snow through much of the New York City area is
exacerbating the water problem, he said; winter rain usually runs off
hard, frozen snow and flows into city reservoirs, but the little rain
that fell this season was quickly absorbed by the soil.</TE>
<TE>   New York state's perilously low reservoirs were drained further last
year when, according to law, several emptied a record-setting 110 billion
gallons into the Delaware River to keep it at mandated levels, Miele
said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, officials in New York City--and in counties up and down the
Eastern Seaboard--will keep talking about conservation and hope the
weather changes.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that we'll do what's needed to cut water use," Bloomberg said.
"But basically what we have here is a failure of nature to cooperate."</TE>

<HD>Medical Study Gives New Life to Proving Near-Death Experiences</HD>
<DH>Science: Research on resuscitated patients found about 18% were
aware of what was happening while they were clinically dead. Skeptics
doubt results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHANKAR VEDANTAM</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 44-year-old man who had collapsed in a meadow was brought to a
hospital, unconscious and with no pulse or brain activity. Doctors began
artificial respiration, heart massage and defibrillation.</LD>
<LD>   A nurse trying to feed a tube down the man's throat saw that he wore
dentures and removed them. The patient was moved to the intensive care
unit.</LD>
<LD>   A week later, the nurse saw the man again. The man immediately
recognized the nurse as the person who had removed his dentures and also
remembered other details of what had happened while he was in a deep
coma. He said he had perceived the events from above the hospital bed and
watched doctors' efforts to save his life.</LD>
<TE>   This account would be standard fare in a supermarket tabloid, but it
was published recently in the Lancet, a British medical journal. It's the
latest in a long series of efforts to either document or debunk the
existence of so-called near-death experiences, which for the most part
have remained in the realm of the paranormal.</TE>
<TE>On-the-Spot Investigations</TE>
<TE>   The new study, conducted in the Netherlands, is one of what are
referred to as prospective scientific studies. Instead of interviewing
people who reported near-death experiences after the fact, researchers
followed hundreds of patients who were resuscitated after suffering
clinical death as their hearts stopped. The idea was that this approach
might provide more accurate accounts by documenting the experiences as
they happened, rather than basing them on distant recollections.</TE>
<TE>   About 18% of the patients in the study reported some recollection of
the period when they were clinically dead, and 8% to 12% reported going
through near-death experiences, such as seeing lights at the end of
tunnels or "crossing over" and speaking with dead relatives and friends.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers say the evidence supports the validity of near-death
experiences and suggests scientists should rethink theories on one of the
ultimate medical mysteries: the nature of human consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics, however, maintain the Dutch researchers provided no evidence
to buttress any extraordinary claims, certainly nothing as dramatic as
proof of an afterlife.</TE>
<TE>   Most neuroscientists believe consciousness is a byproduct of the
physical brain, that mind arises from matter. But if near-death
experiences are really what those who experience them say they are, does
that mean people can be conscious of events around them even when they're
physically unconscious, when their brains show no signs of electrical
activity?</TE>
<TE>   How can consciousness be independent of brain function?</TE>
<TE>   "Compare it with a TV [program]," said Pim van Lommel, a cardiologist
at the Hospital Rijnstate in the Netherlands and the lead investigator of
the research. "If you open the TV set, you will not find the program. The
TV set is a receiver. When you turn off your TV set, the program is still
there but you can't see it. When you put off your brain, your
consciousness is there but you can't feel it in your body."</TE>
<TE>   The study, he said in a telephone interview, suggested that
researchers investigating consciousness "should not look in the cells and
molecules alone."</TE>
<TE>Skeptics Say Memories May Be False</TE>
<TE>   Although he said the research did not address whether there was such a
thing as the soul or God or the afterlife, many remained skeptical. In an
accompanying article, Christopher French, director of the Anomalistic
Psychology Research unit at Britain's Goldsmiths College, said that
multiple questions persisted.</TE>
<TE>   "We have understandable and natural urges to believe we will survive
bodily death and we will be reunited with our departed loved ones," he
said. "So anything that would support that idea--reincarnation, mediums,
ghosts--present evidence of the survival of the soul. It's something that
we would all desperately like to believe is true."</TE>
<TE>   French pointed out that some of those in the study who reported
near-death experiences said in follow-up interviews that they hadn't had
them, while a few who had said they experienced nothing said later that
they now remembered them. He said this could suggest that false memories
were at play.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the study suggests anything beyond the dying process,"
agreed Paul Kurtz, a former philosophy professor at the State University
of New York in Buffalo and chairman for the Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.</TE>
<TE>   "The out-of-body experience and light and traveling down a tunnel and
meeting people on the other side--in my view, these are the psychological
states that people go through as they are dying," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both noted that hearing is the last sense to shut down in the dying
brain and that victims such as the 44-year-old may have heard events
around them and subconsciously reconstructed the events as visual.</TE>
<TE>   The Dutch researchers tracked 344 patients who had been resuscitated,
ranging in age from 26 to 92. Three-quarters were men. Most were
interviewed within five days of being resuscitated, and researchers
followed up with interviews two and eight years later to test the
reliability of the patients' memories.</TE>
<TE>   Patients' demographics, religious beliefs, psychological makeup and
medical treatment were also documented to see who was more likely to
report such experiences.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found the experiences did not correlate with any of
the measured psychological, physiological or medical parameters, which
Lommel said meant the experiences were unrelated to processes in the
dying brain. Most patients had excellent recall of the events, he added,
undermining the theory that the memories were false.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the people who had such experiences reported marked changes
in their personalities, compared with those who had come near death but
not had the experiences. They seemed to lose fear of death, and they
became more compassionate, altruistic and loving.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Greyson, a psychiatry professor at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville who has also done research in the area, said that science
had neither good explanations nor good rebuttals of the conclusions of
the Dutch researchers.</TE>
<TE>   In experiments underway, he said, tiny signs were placed on the
ceilings of hospital rooms, so that if people were genuinely having
out-of-body experiences and hovering over their beds, they would be able
to see the signs and provide "proof" of the phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   While it may take a long time for such experiments to uncover a case,
he and others said, because not all patients will be resuscitated in that
room and not all cardiac arrest cases result in near-death experiences,
it could provide evidence to buttress patients' reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Brain chemistry does not explain these phenomena," Greyson said. "I
don't know what the explanation is, but our current understanding of
brain chemistry falls short."</TE>

<HD>Mixed Reviews on Anti-Terror Interview Plan</HD>
<DH>Michigan: Many of the men sought--most from Arab countries--never
responded. Officials say program serves purpose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT
</DL>
<LD>He was sought out for questioning by the FBI after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, even though he had violated no laws. And, he said, he
certainly hadn't consorted with terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   But the young man--a native of the Middle East who asked to be called
Mourad--agonized for weeks about whether he should agree to the
"voluntary" interview. "I was shocked. I thought: 'I don't fit the
profile. What did they come to me for?' I don't know anything about the
people detained."</LD>
<LD>   After consulting a lawyer, he decided to go ahead with the interview,
if only to show that he had nothing to hide.</LD>
<TE>   Two months after federal authorities sent out letters seeking
interviews with 700 foreign-born men in Michigan--most from Arab
countries--as part of the government's investigation into terrorism, only
half have been questioned.</TE>
<TE>   In eastern Michigan, where most of the men reside, 250 either have
declined to be interviewed or could not be located as of Jan. 24, the
date by which law enforcement officials had hoped to finish the
questioning.</TE>
<TE>'We'll Visit Them More Than Once'</TE>
<TE>   Still, the program is serving its purpose, officials said, of gaining
intelligence about terrorism from people who are not suspects but may
possess useful information without even knowing it.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office and local police will not comment about any
information gleaned from the interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to find them. We'll visit them more than once to try to get to
them," said Robert Cares, the assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit who is
in charge of the counter-terrorism task force here.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan's operation is part of a nationwide effort by the Bush
administration to question about 5,000 people holding temporary visas
from a number of countries, mostly Arab, who have entered the United
States since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan has what is considered the largest Arab community outside the
Middle East--as many as 200,000 people, most of them living in Detroit
and its western suburb of Dearborn. Officials here chose to contact those
sought for interviews by letter, deeming that a kinder way to carry out
the program than having federal agents show up unannounced at someone's
home or workplace.</TE>
<TE>   But if the letters go unanswered, law enforcement officers will follow
up.</TE>
<TE>   "Every case is different. We'll go to someone's address and knock, and
they'll say that John Doe has moved somewhere else," which will also be
checked out, Cares said.</TE>
<TE>   The operation, Cares added, was not intended to root out immigration
scofflaws who have overstayed their visas. But Muslim and civil rights
groups are not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "That remains to be seen, because [the program] is still being wrapped
up," said Haaris Ahmad, executive director of the Michigan branch of the
Council on American-Islamic Relations.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Immigration and Naturalization Service] can play fast and loose
when they get someone on minor visa violations," Ahmad said. "Now you're
going to take these 5,000 people and get a big chunk of them on visa
questions."</TE>
<TE>   Nabih Ayad, a Dearborn attorney who represents a number of people who
received the letters, noted the wording of a letter of instruction from
the U.S. attorney's office to the interviewers: If someone has overstayed
a visa, the interviewer is told to call someone at the INS, "who will
advise you whether the individual is in violation of immigration laws and
whether he should be detained."</TE>
<TE>   Ayad has advised clients with expired visas to decline the interviews
but to seek to clear up their status. "It's kind of like sending sheep to
slaughter." Authorities "would know their new address, phone number, cell
phone number, where they work."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Oates, the chief of police in Ann Arbor, about 40 miles west of
Detroit, at first was skeptical of the proposed interviews, wondering
what could be gained and at what cost to community trust.</TE>
<TE>   He met with members of the Muslim community, who pledged cooperation
if the campaign was held to a terrorism investigation, and Oates was on
board.</TE>
<TE>   Recipients of the letters "came from countries, Arab and non-Arab,
where Al Qaeda had a presence or a recruiting presence," said Oates, who
was chief of intelligence for the New York Police Department before
taking the Ann Arbor job in January 2001. "If, among the 5,000 people,
one or two had some information that was helpful to the federal
government to fight terrorism, it was worth it."</TE>
<TE>   In the interviews, representatives of local police departments, the
FBI, the U.S. attorney's office, the Internal Revenue Service and even
the Treasury Department and Drug Enforcement Administration ask general
questions about an individual's activities in the U.S. They also want to
know whether someone has been approached about being trained in terrorist
activities or knows of anyone who has been approached.</TE>
<TE>   Fears that people would be pressed to turn over all their friends'
telephone numbers have not played out, although some have reported being
asked questions that they thought were irrelevant and too personal, such
as what they talked about in phone conversations with family members
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Mourad, who is in his 20s, said he thought the questions were too
general to be of much use. One question, he said, was: "Do you know
anyone who has committed crimes or terrorist acts, or who might in the
future commit terrorist acts, or who might have purchased guns?"</TE>
<TE>   "Do I know anyone who received military training or 'suspicious'
training?" Mourad said he was asked. "My concern was, do I really know
all the facts about the people I've met?" A simple no ended each line of
questioning.</TE>
<TE>   The Council on American-Islamic Relations has advised the letter
recipients who agree to the interviews to bring a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   That's to avoid people being tricked into saying something they don't
mean and to ease concerns of those afraid that they'll be arrested on the
spot, said Ayad, who has sat in on more than a dozen interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Muslim community say they are cooperating with the
effort but find personal pain in stereotypes that persist.</TE>
<TE>   "We had tears in our eyes on Sept. 11. We grieved with the whole
country," said Ali Dakroub, 35, who moved to Dearborn from Lebanon when
he was 3. "But you also hurt because you get stereotyped. I'd be more
than happy to die for this country, where my children were born."</TE>
<TE>   Dakroub recalled seeing one TV news reporter interviewing an Arab man
at an airport who said he didn't object to searches as long as people who
appeared to be from the Middle East weren't singled out. Said the anchor:
"Do we really want to take advice from Abdullah?"</TE>
<TE>   "This is the kind of thing that really jabs at you," Dakroub said.</TE>
<TE>   But upon hearing of a Muslim woman who was forced to remove her head
scarf at the Baltimore airport, he shook his head. "It's like asking a
nun to take off her headpiece. Diversity is getting jeopardized."</TE>
<TE>   Hasan Qazwini, imam of the Islamic Center's mosque just north of
Dearborn, said he tries to find a balance between what he finds
acceptable and what he views as right.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no problem with the government conducting and implementing
measures to secure the country and society; we understand that our
country was attacked viciously by a bunch of terrorists," Qazwini said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing is when these measures enforce racial profiling. . . .
To be guilty until proven innocent, that is so painful."</TE>
<TE>Demanding a Citizen's 'Green Card'</TE>
<TE>   Qazwini, whose father runs a mosque in Pomona and who became a U.S.
citizen after immigrating from Iraq nine years ago, was stopped at the
Detroit airport in November and repeatedly asked for his "green card"
(identification held by permanent residents), even though he is a U.S.
citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Qazwini tells his congregation during weekly prayers to condemn
terrorism, that the killing of innocent people is not condoned by Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "But there always seems to be some misplaced anger in the world," said
Dakroub, who owns a gas station in Dearborn. "I wish it could be
channeled to a productive way."</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of anger that Mourad swallowed in submitting to the
FBI's questioning.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it was justified, considering the terrible things that
happened to thousands of people. I wanted to contribute to the process."</TE>

<LD>Younger Americans don't know enough about U.S. history to fully
appreciate the freedoms its military is defending in the war against
terrorism, Lynne Cheney said.</LD>
<LD>   The wife of Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking to a Conservative
Political Action Conference group in Arlington, said that in a 1999
survey of seniors from top colleges such as Princeton and Stanford, only
one-fifth knew that the words "government of the people, by the people,
for the people" came from the Gettysburg Address.</LD>
<LD>   She recommended "teach-ins" on college campuses, in public libraries
and in private homes as a way for Americans to learn more about the
nation's history.</LD>

<LD>Former Vice President Al Gore criticized President Bush's handling
of the economy in a speech Saturday night that marked what he called a
return to "the national debate."</LD>
<LD>   "It is now clear that our nation's economic policy is simply not
working, especially for those who most depend on its success," Gore said
before about 1,600 people at a Tennessee Democratic Party fund-raiser.</LD>
<LD>   "We need a government that lives within its means, invests in the
American people and supports tax cuts that are fair and go to those who
need them," he said. "What we don't need is a government whose budget is
based on inaccurate assumptions and whose priorities provide special
favors for the few over the many."</LD>
<TE>   Gore also called for better protection of the environment and campaign
finance reform--indirectly referring to the Enron scandal when he said,
"Recent events have made it clear this reform is needed more than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Gore did not say whether he'll run for president in 2004 and
reiterated his support for Bush's handling of the war on terrorism. At
the $25-a-person fund-raiser at a downtown hotel, he said that "it is
time for the American people to look at the state of our country and
decide the course we will take."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Otto and his wife, Beth, traveled from Lincoln, Neb., to hear the
speech. The couple campaigned for Gore in Missouri in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Otto said it was challenging for Gore to make the right mix,
supporting Bush on the war on terrorism but pointing out what needs to be
done.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not un-American to talk about the surplus under Clinton-Gore and
the deficit under Bush-Cheney," Otto said. "It's not un-American to say
they are not managing the country well."</TE>
<TE>   Gore has been criticized for keeping too low a profile since conceding
the presidential election to Bush but said, "It was right for me and I
would do it again. . . . And tonight, as a new election season begins, I
intend to rejoin the national debate." The crowd responded with
thunderous applause.</TE>
<TE>   The former vice president has created a political action committee to
raise money for campaigning Democrats this year. He also is expected to
travel the nation on their behalf, which would allow him to keep in
contact with party loyalists and potential donors for a 2004 presidential
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, he probably has really not decided whether he wants to
run, but the object is to keep his options open and develop more
visibility. And this is the time to do it," said John Geer, a Vanderbilt
University political science professor.</TE>
<TE>   Gore kicked off his new effort in Tennessee because he is trying to
mend fences in his home state, which he lost in 2000. Had he won, he
would have had enough electoral votes to win the White House.</TE>

<HD>New National Park Gains Momentum</HD>
<DH>Colorado: Nature Conservancy buys key property next to Great Sand
Dunes National Monument. The deed will be turned over to the government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HEILPRIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Congress' efforts to convert the tallest sand dunes in North
America into a Colorado national park and wildlife refuge took a big step
last week with a private conservation group buying a huge ranch next it.</LD>
<LD>   The Nature Conservancy said it is spending $31.28 million to purchase
the 97,000-acre Baca Ranch and two 14,000-foot peaks in southern
Colorado, next to Great Sand Dunes National Monument and Preserve. The
ranch's plentiful aquifer keeps the 750-foot-high dunes intact and
nourishes the San Luis Valley's farmers and ranchers.</LD>
<LD>   The conservation group's purchase prevents the land from being sold to
someone else. Once the deed is turned over to the federal government, the
38,700-acre monument and preserve will be combined with most of the
ranch, including Kit Carson Peak and Challenger Point, to become Great
Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve.</LD>
<TE>A Hunter's Paradise</TE>
<TE>   Part of the ranch will become Baca National Wildlife Refuge, where
hunting will be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "This project represents conservation and partnership at a truly
heroic scale," said Steve McCormick, the group's president.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Congress created a national park was in 1999 with the
conversion of another Colorado national monument into Black Canyon of the
Gunnison National Park. Great Sand Dunes would be the nation's 56th
national park.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Secretary Gale Norton said she strongly supports its creation
in her home state, where she was Colorado's attorney general before
joining the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "This is public-private partnership at its best," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Gov. Bill Owens said the ranch purchase is the largest land
preservation effort in the state's history and would protect "the
history, culture and way of life of the entire San Luis Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Once the park is created, Colorado's Taylor Peak would be the only
remaining 14,000-footer left in private hands in North America.</TE>
<TE>   Spurred by Colorado lawmakers, Congress and the Clinton administration
in 2000 authorized creating the national park and buying the ranch. They
also created Great Sand Dunes National Preserve from 42,000 acres of the
Rio Grande National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Spread between sagebrush grasslands and the snowy Sangre de Cristo
Mountains, the wind-shaped dunes rise from a valley floor at more than
7,000 feet above sea level. The area is abundant with elk, coyotes and
bighorn sheep that pass among the aspen, spruce and pine trees.</TE>
<TE>Just Waiting on Congress</TE>
<TE>   Congress already has appropriated $10.2 million for the park. Yale
University has agreed to donate up to $4 million in profits from the sale
of its interest in the ranch. Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.) said the only
thing remaining for Congress is to appropriate at least $17 million to
repay the Nature Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   Yale and other parties with a stake in the ranch had promoted a
controversial plan to sell its water to the fast-growing cities along
Colorado's Front Range north and south of Denver. However, Colorado
voters in 1998 overwhelmingly defeated initiatives to aid that plan.</TE>
<TE>   Allard said the idea for creating the national park and wildlife
refuge blossomed from a 1998 town meeting in Alamosa, Colo., where
residents said they wanted both to protect the area's natural resources
and create a bigger draw for tourists.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an example of how land-use issues should be handled from the
local level up," he said. "Now we have an entire ecosystem that's
enclosed and protected here."</TE>

<HD>Families Cope With Life as Their Convict Patriarchs Do the Same</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle: The hidden victims of the legal system maintain hope
that something can be salvaged should the loved one be released.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>Jesse Parks' love for his father has remained strong for all of his
20 years, even though the elder Parks has spent the past 16 years in
prison and may spend the rest of his life there.</LD>
<LD>   "I was 4 years old when the police came and took my dad away for
killing a man, and I know that he may never get out of prison," Parks
said. "I've had to accept it, but it has been hard not to be able to do
things with my dad like other kids. It's like I have had to serve a
sentence too."</LD>
<LD>   Family members of those sentenced to spend most or all of their life
in prison often feel they also are being punished.</LD>
<TE>   Some lose contact. Some struggle to stay in touch and hope their loved
one will eventually return home, even given the daunting prospect of
caring for an aged ex-convict with little or no state assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone is imprisoned for decades, it is so difficult for
families to maintain contact," said Julie Stewart, founder of the
Washington-based Families Against Mandatory Minimums.</TE>
<TE>   Families struggle financially just to survive. They often can't afford
to visit prisons that may be hundreds of miles away.</TE>
<TE>   The families of murder victims are also left to grieve, often for a
lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   "We always say the victims die once, but the families die a thousand
times," said Nancy Ruhe-Munch, executive director of the Cincinnati-based
national advocacy group Parents of Murdered Children.</TE>
<TE>   Ruhe-Munch counsels parents of murdered children. Some of them suffer
stress-related illnesses, she said. Some die years before what should be
a natural life span.</TE>
<TE>   She believes that repressed rage, guilt or grief can take a toll on
those victims.</TE>
<TE>   "It's horrible," she said. "It's a hopeless feeling. They want some
justice, and they don't always get it."</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Parks was convicted in 1985 of first-degree murder for shooting
to death a park ranger, who authorities say was responding to a report of
gunshots at a campground in Duncan, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said his father was drunk and cannot remember what happened, but
prosecutors had suggested he may have shot the ranger to avoid arrest. He
was not allowed to have a gun because he previously was convicted of
selling marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   He is serving a sentence of 15 years to life at the Diamondback
Correctional Facility in Watonga, Okla. He was denied parole in 2000 and
will not be eligible again until next year.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Parks and his mother, 55-year-old Jennifer Thomas, moved to
Cincinnati 14 years ago to be near her family. He spends summers and
Christmas vacations with his paternal grandparents so he can visit his
father.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kept away from the trial because I was so young, but my mother
was up front with me," he said. "She made it clear that my dad had gotten
into trouble and we were going to have a life without him. I didn't like
it, but I didn't have any choice."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas said she had considered telling her son that his father had
died or had simply walked away from his family.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] I decided it was best for Jesse to know that his father didn't
leave him voluntarily," said Thomas, who remained married to Arthur Parks
for 10 years after he was imprisoned. "I told him that his father's
alcoholism had led him to make some bad mistakes, but I also knew that
Arthur was not a career criminal who would lead Jesse into a life of
crime."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, who has remarried, said she taught her son to lie about his
father's situation when he was a child.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid he would be hurt, but I let him make his own decision
when he got older and now he is open about it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At age 52, Arthur Parks has had a minor stroke, heart problems and he
has a crippled leg.</TE>
<TE>   "Health care in prison is not much," his son said. "I hope that he can
stay healthy and get out someday, but whatever happens, I'm in it for the
long haul. He's my dad."</TE>
<TE>   Alison Coleman, the wife of a man sentenced in 1980 to 25 years to
life, says she and her children have similar concerns as her husband ages
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, 51, of Albany, N.Y., remains married to her 52-year-old
husband, who is at the Washington Correctional Facility in Comstock, N.Y.
He was sentenced as a persistent felony offender after a robbery
conviction. His wife has formed a support group for other New York
families in the same situation.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, who doesn't want her husband's name publicized because she
feels prison inmates are safer keeping a low profile, said her goal is
for him to stay healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't be paroled for at least four more years, and it may never
happen," she said. "He is very fit for his age, but it is scary. The
bottom line for prisoners and their families is the fear that they may
die there among strangers."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman said the stress of the past 21 years has taken a toll. For the
first few years her husband was in prison, they were allowed a family
reunion, and their second child, Andre, was conceived.</TE>
<TE>   "I really loved my husband and I decided to do my best to stay with
him," she said. "But I finally couldn't handle it anymore and I separated
from him emotionally and physically for about 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   She said her children, 19-year-old Andre and 22-year-old Cecily, love
their father very much, and she made sure they were able to visit him.
About five years ago, she reconnected with her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "He is now putting his family first," she said, "and is trying to stay
healthy so that we can have some good years if he does get out."</TE>

<HD>Enron's Lay Faces Capitol Hill Hot Seat</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Former chief executive is expected to testify before a
Senate panel about what he knew of the firm's collapse and when.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When Kenneth L. Lay appears before Congress on Monday, his
interrogators are expected to pursue a familiar theme: What did he know
and when did he know it?</LD>
<LD>   Two distinct portraits of Lay have emerged in the wake of Enron's
collapse. One is of a pioneering business genius who created high-flying
Enron Corp. and turned it into the darling of Wall Street, his hands
firmly on the controls.</LD>
<LD>   The other is of a benign figurehead who was hopelessly out of the loop
as greedy minions devised complicated schemes that cloaked the company's
debts and losses.</LD>
<TE>   According to a key advisor, Lay is "ready for the fight" before the
Senate Commerce Committee and likely to portray himself as remote from
underlings who engineered Enron's complex financial deals.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken had been trying to step back for a while and do other things with
his life," said Sue Walden, a Houston political consultant who helped
prepare Lay for the hearing. "He was out of the mix in a lot of the daily
management of the company."</TE>
<TE>   But that argument was rejected by the special investigation committee
appointed by the board of directors, which issued its report Saturday on
Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "For much of the period in question," the report said, Lay was the
chief executive of Enron and, in effect, the captain of the ship. As
chief executive, he had the ultimate responsibility for taking reasonable
steps to ensure that the officers reporting to him performed their
oversight duties properly.</TE>
<TE>   "He does not appear to have directed their attention, or his own, to
the oversight of the . . . partnerships. Ultimately, a large measure of
the responsibility rests with the CEO."</TE>
<TE>   Similar points were being made in Congress even before the report's
release.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me tell you what people back home in Oregon are saying," said
Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of the interrogators on the Commerce
Committee. "They're asking me how can it be that the head of a major
corporation, with all these reports about warning signals month after
month, how can it that [the leaders] didn't know anything about it?
That's the issue that needs to be explored."</TE>
<TE>Official Warned of Danger Signs</TE>
<TE>   Wyden was referring specifically to a warning in August from Enron
Vice President Sherron K. Watkins that the company could "implode in a
wave of accounting scandals" centered on a number of off-the-book
partnerships created to hide losses. Although Watkins urged hiring an
independent law firm to investigate the partnerships, Lay turned to the
company's longtime Houston law firm, Vinson &amp; Elkins, which had earlier
approved some of the same questionable partnership agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Lay will lead off the first of several Capitol Hill hearings this week
on the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Congress is investigating
whether investors were deceived by accounting tricks and lax audits and
what new laws and regulations are needed to protect investors and
employees' pensions.</TE>
<TE>   As he huddles this weekend with his lawyers, there is still the chance
that Lay will not show up. Enron faces a federal grand jury investigation
in Houston and a criminal Justice Department probe, and Lay himself is a
defendant in several civil class-action lawsuits filed by employees and
stockholders. According to sources, Lay's lawyers have advised him
against testifying.</TE>
<TE>   Lay is expected to encounter not only a tough panel of congressional
interrogators--at a packed, nationally televised hearing--but also former
Enron workers who blame him and other company brass for obliterating
their retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Several other key players in the Enron investigation also are expected
to testify this week, including Jeffrey K. Skilling, who quit as Enron
chief executive in August, and Andrew Fastow, the former chief financial
officer who is regarded as the expert on the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>Taking of Oath Subject of Debate</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators say they expect Fastow to invoke his 5th
Amendment right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Late last week, senators and staffers were still debating whether Lay
should be forced to take an oath before his testimony. Some expressed
concern that it would be unfair to demand this of Lay, since it is not
being required of all witnesses and Lay agreed to testify voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   Lay, who is represented by Washington attorney Earl J. Silbert, the
first Watergate prosecutor, has not sought nor been offered immunity in
exchange for his testimony, a congressional staffer said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the questions facing Lay will be management's decision to set up
partnerships that allowed it to move assets off its books, concealing its
true debts and liabilities and artificially boosting its credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   He will also be questioned about the company's retirement plan, which
was based on contributions of company stock. The value of those accounts
plummeted last year as the stock took a dive.</TE>
<TE>   And, in what could carry the most long-term effects of the Enron
hearings, he will be asked about his lobbying for regulatory changes
exempting most of Enron's commodity trading from oversight and
restrictions and the role it may have played in Enron's troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the deregulation rule changes used by Enron were the result of
intensive political lobbying by the Houston company, which poured more
than $6 million into congressional campaign funds, including those of a
number of lawmakers conducting the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, however, the Enron campaign contributions are likely to
intensify the grilling of Lay as senators on both sides of the aisle
scramble to demonstrate their independence from their onetime benefactor.</TE>
<TE>   "[Lay] will get the hottest and most hostile reception of any witness
in modern memory," predicted Washington lawyer Stephen M. Ryan, a former
general counsel for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.), a Commerce Committee member,
said that one of his first questions to Lay will be: "Didn't you ever
think that something was wrong when Enron was able to take a business
that has no earnings and no revenues and get $110 million for it?"</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers are expected to home in on contacts between Lay
and his representatives with the Bush administration. Several lawmakers
promised to press Lay about Enron's lobbying against price controls when
electricity costs soared on the West Coast last year.</TE>
<TE>   Houston political consultant George Strong sees some irony in the
lawmakers' aggressiveness. Strong, who worked as a consultant and
lobbyist for Enron and its predecessor company, Houston Natural Gas, for
25 years, remembers a time not long ago when "every U.S. senator who came
to Houston wanted to meet with Ken Lay and ask him for money. He was the
political go-to guy." Lay, whose campaign largess favored Republicans but
included many Democrats, was also a major benefactor of George W. Bush's
campaigns, both for Texas governor and for president.</TE>
<TE>   Lay and his wife personally contributed $122,000 to Bush's two
gubernatorial campaigns and a total of $245,000 to the national
Republican Party, the Bush presidential campaign and the inaugural fund.
Although the Lay family was personally closer to the elder George Bush, a
longtime Houston resident, Lay was on a nickname basis with George W.
Bush, who called him "Kenny Boy."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to then-Gov. Bush's appearance with Lay at the 2000
opening day game at Enron Field, home of the Houston Astros, the two men
also met on several occasions in Austin during the 1997-98 Texas debate
over electricity deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   Since the collapse of Enron, Bush has downplayed the relationship. But
Strong, who first met the future Enron chief when Lay was a lobbyist in
Washington for Florida Gas, said the relationship was probably somewhat
closer than both men let on.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they were really buddy-buddy," said Strong. "But it is
sort of humorous that George W. now says he hardly knew Ken Lay, calling
him 'Mr. Lay.' I think they had a much better relationship than that."</TE>
<TE>   According to Walden, the political consultant, one of Lay's biggest
concerns is that the Enron collapse will be used as a political weapon
"to hurt the president."</TE>
<TE>   "He has the greatest respect for the president," Walden said.</TE>
<TE>   Largely because of his considerable charity and civic activities in
Houston, Lay is still viewed there as a much more sympathetic character
than other main players in the Enron saga, such as Skilling and Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   But that sympathy appeared to be tested last week, when his wife,
Linda, appeared on television shows to assert that the couple is on the
verge of economic ruin.</TE>
<TE>Lays Own 18 Homes and Properties</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the Lays own 18 homes and properties in Texas and
Colorado valued at more than $30 million, including a $7.1-million
apartment in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Under Texas law, a person's home is protected from bankruptcy action.
After Linda Lay's appearance, reporters at the Houston Press, the city's
alternative newspaper, mockingly suggested mounting a charity drive for
canned goods and blankets for the Lays.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the Lays," said longtime friend and local heiress Joan
Schnitzer-Levy, "but Linda's plea of poverty didn't sit well with a lot
of people here."</TE>

<HD>2 Face Runoff for Mayor of New Orleans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS
</DL>
<LD>Two men who had never run for office, a cable executive and the
police chief, led 13 opponents in Saturday's primary for mayor and
claimed the March 2 runoff.</LD>
<LD>   With 401 of 442 precincts, or 91%, reporting, Cox Cable executive Ray
Nagin had 32,722 votes, or 28%. Richard Pennington, on leave as
superintendent of police, had 27,663 votes, or 24%.</LD>
<LD>   State Sen. Paulette Irons had 21,739 votes, or 19%. Only one other
candidate, City Councilman Jim Singleton, had more than 10% of the vote.
He had 15,456 votes, or 13%.</LD>
<TE>   "This is about New Orleans growing," Nagin told his supporters. "It's
about one of the greatest cities in America finally waking up and saying,
'We're sick and tired, and sick and tired of the same old politics.' "</TE>
<TE>   Pennington, in a speech claiming the second spot, said security would
continue to be part of his campaign. "The Super Bowl is here; this is a
safe city," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A referendum passed on raising the city's minimum wage to $6.15 an
hour, $1 above the national minimum, but legal challenges are certain.</TE>
<TE>   With 91% of the precincts reporting, the vote was 64,314 yes to 36,851
no, a 64%-to-36% split.</TE>

<HD>Hunters Flock to Arkansas' Stuttgart</HD>
<DH>Recreation: The small town calls itself the duck capital of the
world, and an industry has grown up around the sport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN SKOLOFF</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>STUTTGART, Ark.
</DL>
<LD>Ducks come down like broken kites, fluttering clumsily toward the
glassy water.</LD>
<LD>   The wounded quiver, and a dog leaps from a floating platform to
retrieve them. Camouflaged hunters wade into knee-deep water for a closer
look. A burly guide plucks a stiff feather from the back of a twitching
bird and pokes the pointed quill into its neck, killing it instantly.</LD>
<LD>   The hunters return to their foliage-covered hiding place and wait.
They swap stories while all eyes scan the overcast sky--looking for more
birds.</LD>
<TE>   In Stuttgart, the self-proclaimed duck capital of the world, you can
sum up a dislike for someone by simply saying, "I wouldn't share a duck
stand with him."</TE>
<TE>   Located in the heart of Arkansas' Grand Prairie and the Mississippi
Flyway, Stuttgart attracts duck hunters from throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, the Grand Prairie was a vast landscape of native grasses
"as tall as a man," some say. Early settlers came to the area to graze
livestock and sell hay to northern states.</TE>
<TE>   "The settlers would get off of their covered wagons and step down and
you couldn't see their heads," says Pat Peacock, director of the
Stuttgart Agricultural Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Stuttgart's skyline is dominated by grain silos, giving the impression
of skyscrapers from a distance. The surrounding land is flat and flooded,
the tall grass now replaced by a checkerboard of backwaters, bayous and
fields of soybeans and rice. Two of the world's largest rice producers
are based in Stuttgart.</TE>
<TE>   The term "Duck Capital" refers both to its claim as the nation's top
duck-hunting area, and the money that hunting provides.</TE>
<TE>   The town of about 10,000 is home to the Wings Over the Prairie
Festival in November, which includes the annual World Championship
Duck-Calling Contest. The first winner, back in 1936, used only his mouth
to simulate the duck call and won a $7 hunting coat. The 2001 winner,
using a $150 acrylic duck call, took home about $40,000 worth of prizes.</TE>
<TE>   The festival also includes the annual Queen Mallard beauty pageant
that began in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   Peacock was the city's first Queen Mallard and is the only woman to
win the duck-calling contest. She took home the prize two years in a
row--in 1955 and 1956.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't too popular with the guys," Peacock said. "But I used the
money to go on to college."</TE>
<TE>   Peacock, an avid duck hunter in a sport dominated by men, was featured
in a Sports Illustrated article and subsequently went on the road as a
spokeswoman for a leading brand of hunting boots.</TE>
<TE>   Once, she recalls, "ducks fell from the sky" onto Main Street, brought
down by nature, not bullets.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1973, a group of ducks flying over Stuttgart hit a cold
spot in the upper atmosphere, froze and dropped to earth, some breaking
storefront windows, damaging roofs and denting cars.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't imagine the damage that can be done from the impact of a
frozen-solid duck," Peacock says.</TE>
<TE>   During the two duck hunting seasons--Nov. 18-Dec. 20 and Dec. 26-Jan.
21--hunting-related activities pump more than $2 million a day into the
state's economy, $1 million into Stuttgart alone. Annually, duck-hunting
related retail sales funnel $55 million into the state's economy,
including about $3 million in sales tax and $1 million in income taxes.
The sport provides about 1,700 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   George Young, known locally as Junior, can make as much as $2,500 a
day plucking, skinning, cleaning and packing the duck kills of hunters.
He sells certain feathers for fly-fishing lures and saves the necks and
feet for local hog farmers to use as feed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a welder, but I had a lung taken out from cancer, so I'm doing
this," says Young, a dead duck dangling from one hand, a bloody hatchet
in the other.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Mack's Prairie Wings sport shop epitomizes the local
duck-hunting phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   As more duck hunters began arriving in Stuttgart in the 1930s,
McCollum's Hardware Store, located on Main Street, began stocking hunting
supplies. In 1944, a separate small store was opened for only hunting
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Within 30 years, the hunting supply business expanded to include a
3,200-square-foot store. Today, Mack's is located in a 90,000-square-foot
store dedicated solely to waterfowl hunting and has a mail order
operation that sent out 1.7 million catalogs last year to customers
throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   The store's hours of operation, to accommodate hunters, are 4:30 a.m.
to 6 p.m., seven days a week.</TE>
<TE>   Bayou Meto, which snakes through central Arkansas, is the largest
state-owned public shooting ground in the country, with about 34,000
acres of flooded timber.</TE>
<TE>   Ducks fly south en masse to escape the northern winters and return to
cooler locations to raise their young in the spring. They come down along
four separate flyways, the largest being along the Mississippi River.
Arkansas has 8 million acres of the 24 million-acre Mississippi River
Alluvial Plain, better known as the Delta--more than any other state.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas drew 100,000 duck hunters last year, and historically it has
attracted the likes of William Faulkner and Clark Gable, as well as
several presidents, from Teddy Roosevelt to the first George Bush. Legend
has it that before early settlers came to Arkansas, the Quapaw Indians
would mount stuffed ducks on their heads, swim underwater to a floating
duck, then grab its legs and pull it under.</TE>
<TE>   Though Arkansas is second to Louisiana in the number of all types of
ducks killed annually--1.5 million, compared with Louisiana's 2.5
million--it is No. 1 for mallards, the prized green-headed variety.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Drummond's Pintail Peninsula hunting lodge caters to the
corporate crowd.</TE>
<TE>   At $600 a day, Pintail is a high-end hunt club--once dubbed the "Taj
Mahal of duck hunting" by the Wall Street Journal.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted some magnificence," Drummond says. His 14,000-square-foot
log cabin lodge has elk antler chandeliers that hang from a vaulted
ceiling. Plush couches and carved wooden furniture surround a huge stone
fireplace in the gathering room, its walls mostly windows looking out
onto the flooded prairie.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 miles from Pintail is Carlton Crosby's Wild Wings Hunting
Club.</TE>
<TE>   More like a home than a vacation lodge, it offers full-service hunting
trips at half the cost of places like Pintail.</TE>
<TE>   A former farmer, Crosby now devotes his 1,275 acres to hunting--ducks,
deer and dove.</TE>
<TE>   He says he used to gross about $250,000 a year growing soybeans and
rice, but had to put most of it back into the business. Now, he says he
is grossing about the same amount, with fewer expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "Duck hunting around here is a tradition," Crosby says. "And because
I've got hunting in my blood, this is something I've always wanted to
do."</TE>

<HD>Atlantis Inspires Intrepid Geologist</HD>
<DH>Legends: A scientist thinks the city sat on an island in the Strait
of Gibraltar and was inundated by rising seas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GUY GUGLIOTTA</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was Plato, around 360 B. C., who first described an ancient,
exotic island kingdom catastrophically buried beneath the sea when its
once-virtuous people angered the gods with their pronounced tilt toward
sin and corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, creative souls ranging from Jules Verne to Kirk Morris,
Maria Montez, Fay Spain, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Michael J. Fox and Walt
Disney have sought to explain and exploit the terrible fate that befell
Atlantis.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, for 2,000 years, scientists and scholars have mulled the
tale recounted by Critias in Plato's "Dialogues" in hopes of finding
clues as to whether Atlantis actually existed and, if so, where it was
and how exactly it vanished.</LD>
<TE>   This fall, French geologist and prehistorian Jacques Collina-Girard
presented research suggesting that Atlantis was a real place--a small
mid-channel island sitting in what is now the Strait of Gibraltar.</TE>
<TE>   Its doom was sealed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age
when rising seas swamped it along with six other nearby islands,
Collina-Girard said. Today, the islands are shoals crouched anywhere from
175 feet to 410 feet below the ocean's surface along the coasts of Spain
and Morocco.</TE>
<TE>   Collina-Girard said the legend of Atlantis likely grew as storytellers
embellished it on its way to Plato and Athens 9,000 years later. He
compared the story to Noah's flood, an idea that he said probably arose
after the rising Mediterranean overran the Bosporus 7,600 years ago to
cascade into what is now the Black Sea basin.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the same thing," Collina-Girard said. "Everywhere--in the
Middle East, Europe and Asia--people have stories that speak of the time
when the sea came in. Atlantis is another discrete story of the flood."</TE>
<TE>   The world has not lacked for theories about Atlantis, whose location
has been placed anywhere from the Atlantic abyss to waters off the
Americas or even the South China Sea. The most popular current view among
scholars is that Atlantis was probably the Aegean island of Thira, about
70 miles north of Crete, destroyed by volcanic eruptions in 1470 B. C.</TE>
<TE>   The flaw here, Collina-Girard said, is that the Thira story ignores
Plato. "The trouble up to now has been that geologists are not generally
interested in Atlantis, while the people who are interested in Atlantis
are not geologists."</TE>
<TE>   Reporting this fall in the Proceedings of the French Academy of
Sciences, Collina-Girard instead suggested that Atlantis can probably be
found where Plato said it was: "an island situated in front of the
straits which are by you [the Athenians] called the Pillars of Hercules
[Gibraltar]," as Critias tells Socrates.</TE>
<TE>   Oceanography shows that sea level at the height of the Ice Age about
20,000 years ago was more than 400 feet lower than it is today,
Collina-Girard said. For the next 15,000 years, the sea rose as ice
melted--as little as 2 feet per century at first and as much as 12 feet
per century later.</TE>
<TE>   When the thaw began, there were seven islands at the western end of
the strait and a bit farther west, framing a section of the Atlantic in
an "inland sea" described by Plato. Atlantis was in mid-channel, about 20
miles southwest of modern-day Tarifa, Spain, and 12 miles northwest of
Tangier, Morocco, according to Collina-Girard.</TE>
<TE>   As time passed, the rising sea consumed the islands one by one, until
only Atlantis and one other remained. And for its last 300 years,
Collina-Girard calculated that sea level at Atlantis was rising about 8
feet per century.</TE>
<TE>   "A man with a 50-year life span would notice it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his theory fits comfortably with the "Dialogues." What does
not is Critias' estimate that Atlantis was "larger than Libya and Asia
put together," and his assertion that Atlantis succumbed to volcanic
eruption. Collina-Girard's Atlantis is nine miles long and three miles
wide.</TE>
<TE>   Collina-Girard said these discrepancies can be explained by different
methods of measuring distances in Athens and Egypt, the origin of the
Atlantis story, according to Critias, and the Athenians' familiarity with
volcanoes and earthquakes--and unfamiliarity with glacial melt.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Love got in the way Saturday night, forcing a large contingent of
police to escort the high-profile delegates of the World Economic Forum
from the midtown Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to the New York Stock Exchange in
lower Manhattan for a gala dinner.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers of the forum, which moved from Davos, Switzerland, to New
York in a post-Sept. 11 show of support for the city, planned to hold the
dinner in the hotel's grand ballroom. But when they tried to book it last
fall, a happy couple already had it reserved for their wedding.</LD>
<LD>   "We asked would it be any chance possible for them to consider moving
it to a different date. They said no," said Charles McLean, a spokesman
for the conference.</LD>
<TE>   The forum then scrambled to find a substitute site, and the stock
exchange was happy to oblige.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who they are, but I wish them well," McLean said of the
bride and groom.</TE>

<HD>Archdiocese Ousts 2 Priests Over Abuse Allegations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>QUINCY, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston said Saturday that two
priests were suspended from all assignments following the discovery of
past allegations of sexual misconduct involving minors.</LD>
<LD>   The archdiocese, which has been reviewing personnel records under a
sexual abuse policy announced two weeks ago by Cardinal Bernard Law, said
it was giving the names of both priests to prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   The archdiocese identified the parish priests as the Rev. Paul J.
Finegan of St. Bernadette Church in Randolph and the Rev. Daniel Graham
of St. Joseph Church in Quincy.</LD>
<TE>   The archdiocese said multiple allegations of sexual misconduct with
minors had been made against Finegan and that one such allegation had
been made against Graham.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokeswoman Donna Morrissey said she did not know when the
allegations were made.</TE>
<TE>   A message left for Finegan at St. Bernadette Rectory was not returned
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A man who answered the phone Saturday at St. Joseph Rectory said
Graham would not comment. The man declined to give his name.</TE>
<TE>   In a message to parishioners printed in a bulletin for weekend Masses,
Graham, who has diabetes, said he was taking health leave to care for
himself and his 97-year-old father.</TE>
<TE>   "I apologize for the abruptness of this change, but sometimes
overwhelming needs must be dealt with immediately," Graham said in the
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Two bishops in the archdiocese addressed parishioners at weekend
Masses at the two churches.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Richard Malone, speaking to parishioners at St. Joseph, said
telling them about the allegations was "the hardest thing I've ever had
to do."</TE>
<TE>   The parishioners are being offered counseling, and those with
information about the allegations are being asked to contact either the
archdiocese or prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   St. Joseph parishioner Mary Kahler, 33, said Graham has "always been a
listening ear, a positive voice. I'm hoping that the allegations are
completely unjustified. Maybe a lot of us are in denial, but I don't
think so."</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese implemented the sexual abuse policy following the
release of court records showing it had moved former priest John Geoghan
from parish to parish despite allegations against him.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan was defrocked in 1998 and convicted of indecent assault last
month in one of three criminal cases against him.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the archdiocese reported names of priests accused of
sexually abusing children over the last 40 years to local authorities.
The archdiocese, which did not disclose the number of names, said none of
those individuals were in active service in the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "The most troubling thing to me is the number," said Phil Saviano,
regional coordinator for the New England chapter of the Survivors Network
for Those Abused by Priests. "It wasn't one priest; it's two and in
Finegan's case it was multiple allegations."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represents 70 alleged victims in
civil suits against the archdiocese, said the church appeared to be
moving in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to identify the problem before you make a correction.
Apparently the Archdiocese of Boston is beginning to do that," he said.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Ruling Is Criticized</HD>
<DH>Latin America: President accuses Supreme Court of 'trickery' for
declaring a banking freeze unconstitutional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde lashed out Saturday at the
Supreme Court justices who declared the government's banking freeze
unconstitutional, accusing them of deceit.</LD>
<LD>   "We should let our friends around the world know that we have
problems, and one of those problems, regrettably, is one we confront
today: a Supreme Court that is totally discredited," Duhalde said.</LD>
<LD>   In his weekly radio address, he added that the court's "trickery"
could have grave consequences for Argentina's economic crisis.</LD>
<TE>   The angry words came a day after the court--ruling for a depositor who
had demanded his trapped savings--called the 2-month-old banking
restrictions "irrational" and an "annihilation" of property rights.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions limit cash withdrawals from most accounts to about
$800 and leave many dollar-denominated deposits frozen until 2003. After
four years of recession, the restrictions remain a highly charged symbol
of the government's handling of the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   An Economy Ministry source told the Reuters news agency that Economy
Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov would announce a plan this evening aimed at
easing confusion over the ruling and heading off a Central Bank move to
impose a banking and foreign exchange holiday Monday and Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The government plan is expected to include rules for repaying large
debts taken out in U.S. dollars and returning some frozen deposits as
well as tax breaks to help jump-start the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation between the executive and judiciary branches also
marked a new phase in Argentina's crisis and prompted scattered protests.</TE>
<TE>   "Regrettably, the decision that they've taken is extremely serious,"
Duhalde said of the ruling. This "strikes a very strong blow to any
chance of an orderly exit from the financial crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde scrapped a roll-out of a major recovery package and warned
depositors that they shouldn't expect the court decision to mean they
would get their deposits back quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde, who on Jan. 2 became Argentina's fifth president since
mid-December, has vowed to put the frayed economy back together.</TE>
<TE>   He held emergency Cabinet meetings Saturday with aides to discuss his
next steps after urging people to remain patient.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde suggested that the court, recently a target of nearly daily
protests by Argentines who complain that the justice system is failing,
appeared politically motivated.</TE>

<HD>Desperate Dreamers Roll the Dice on a Better Future in Las Vegas</HD>
<DH>Lifestyles: City's glitzy reputation attracts those down on their
luck. But the lure can be a mirage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGIE WAGNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>Nightfall comes to the dingy street corner, and the flickering
lights of the 7-Eleven keep watch over the prayer group trying to bring
the divine to a carnal city.</LD>
<LD>   Jon Philips, who says he's been drunk for 45 days, wanders up and
staggers into their prayer circle.</LD>
<LD>   "Bring us a brighter day," someone prays.</LD>
<TE>   Philips drops to his knees and the men and women of the Christian
Motorcyclist Assn. encircle him, their Harleys parked nearby.</TE>
<TE>   In a city that sells fantasies of easy money and 24-hour fun, a more
desperate reality lies just beyond the neon and glitz.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the hardest town in America to live in," says Hal Rothman, a
history professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. "There's no net
to catch you."</TE>
<TE>   Gambling-addiction programs are few. Lines are long at the city's
missions. The homeless population is estimated to have nearly doubled to
12,000 since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   For many, Las Vegas is an American dream--affordable housing, no state
income tax and well-paying jobs that don't require much education. Only
three states have fewer college graduates, but the average household
income of $42,177 is the nation's 19th highest.</TE>
<TE>   Valet car attendants can easily bring in $50,000. Card dealers on the
Strip can make much more than that and don't even need a high school
diploma.</TE>
<TE>   From 1990 to 2000, the Las Vegas area's population grew 62%, the
sharpest rate of increase for any metropolitan area in the country. Now,
1.3 million people live in southern Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   This city has become a glamorous getaway for visitors, but Las Vegas
also attracts the desperate, people who couldn't make it anywhere else
and come here as a last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Inside a hot, sweaty gym miles from the neon lights, Mike Jamison is
training for his next boxing match. He's in poor shape and isn't
prepared, but he's been promised $1,000 if he fights in a small venue at
an off-Strip casino.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody's ever heard of the 24-year-old Jamison, a high school dropout
who came here a year ago from Memphis. But he believes he can be a
champion.</TE>
<TE>   Young boxers flock to the city and fill local gyms, hoping Las Vegas
and its boxing-capital reputation will help them become the next Lennox
Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all training because everybody wants to come to Las Vegas,
where they think they can make it," says former referee Richard Steele,
who manages the Nevada Partners gym where Jamison trains. "If you don't
have the talent, you're never gonna make it. Just coming to Las Vegas
isn't good enough."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Jamison will be the next star. But in a city built on odds, his
chances are slim.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing it for 12 years. It's all I know how to do," Jamison
says. "I just pray to God I can stay in Vegas and keep my sanity."</TE>
<TE>   His family back in Memphis believes that he is making lots of money
and living an extraordinary life in the land of opportunity, Jamison
says. But he has no car, barely pays his bills and skips meals when
there's no food. He prays for his next $1,000 fight.</TE>
<TE>   On his birthday recently, his girlfriend bought him a chocolate
cake--with a hot check, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Vegas can break you or make you," he says, stepping into the gym's
practice ring.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away, it's Friday afternoon and a stripper who uses the
name Jackie has just begun her shift at Larry's Villa, a drab, smoky
place most tourists will never find. It's a locals' bar, with the same
customers day after day.</TE>
<TE>   They feed quarters into video poker machines and some hardly glance up
at the girls twirling around metal poles.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate Las Vegas," Jackie, 32, says, sitting in her rose-colored bra
and G-string during a break. "I'm so tired of this job, watching them
gawk at you and not tipping."</TE>
<TE>   She's a single mother of two who dances six days a week and cleans
houses on the side to make ends meet. Her income depends on how well the
customers like her and how much they tip.</TE>
<TE>   Women who dance in some of the city's well-known strip clubs, just
beyond Las Vegas Boulevard, can make pretty good money--$1,000 or more on
a good night. Those are the clubs tourists frequent. At Larry's Villa, a
good night might be $300--and those can be rare.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, there's not enough for Jackie and her children to eat, she
says, so she goes without. Her earnings also have to take care of her
mother, who has cancer and a gambling habit. When it gets really bad,
Jackie borrows from her regular customers.</TE>
<TE>   "I live day to day," she says, returning to the stage for a group
dance.</TE>
<TE>   She's been doing this for five years, barely scraping by, but always
looking for a big payday. She's tired of dancing, but says it boosts her
ego to have men stare at her.</TE>
<TE>   "It just makes you feel so good."</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that it doesn't pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   "Las Vegas is built on illusion and dreams," says Barbara Brents, a
UNLV sociologist. "Its whole goal to tourists is to sell fantasy. In some
ways, that spills over into people who see it as a place where they can
fulfill things that they couldn't do elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Mike Jamison thought.</TE>
<TE>   He lost the fight by a technical knockout in the second round. "I
fought the fight for the money," he says. "They lied to me. They told me
it was an easy fight."</TE>
<TE>   A week later, the $1,000 is almost gone. He thinks he might finally
give up the dream and get a regular job.</TE>
<TE>   "Vegas, I'm hating it. I can't live fight to fight anymore. Man, I'm
trying to live," he says.</TE>
<TE>   It's another Friday night downtown on the east end of Fremont Street,
past the popular light show that beckons thousands of tourists each
night, past the sparkling casinos.</TE>
<TE>   The Christian motorcyclists in their leathers are handing out
religious material, hoping to save someone from the perils of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Philips, 39, has tried to leave Las Vegas a dozen times in 28
years, he says. But he always returns for the nonstop gambling and
drinking. His brother wires him $20 every other day; Philips doesn't tell
him he gambles most of it away.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a heartache that's going to last for the rest of my life," he
says, a tear slipping down his cheek.</TE>
<TE>   The prayer ends, the circle of bikers breaks up and Las Vegas begins
another 24 hours.</TE>

<HD>2 States Immersed in Water Skirmish</HD>
<DH>Resources: Plans to take 20 million gallons a day out of Washington
aquifer to cool three proposed Idaho power plants stirs bitter debate.</DH>

<DL>SPOKANE, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>Washington and Idaho share the water in a massive underground
aquifer that straddles the state line, but people in the two states don't
necessarily share views on how the resource should be used.</LD>
<LD>   Plans to take 20 million gallons per day out of the Spokane
Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer to cool three proposed electricity plants
in Idaho are sparking a water fight.</LD>
<LD>   "The Spokane aquifer is being mined," complained Rachael Paschal
Osborn of Spokane, attorney for environmental and labor groups that
oppose the power plants. "It's a finite resource."</LD>
<TE>   "We must let science carry the day here rather than fear and
emotions," countered Jeff Freeman, a spokesman for Cogentrix Energy Inc.
of Charlotte, N.C., which is proposing one of the plants.</TE>
<TE>   Cogentrix will try to persuade the Idaho Department of Water Resources
in hearings that begin Feb. 11 that there is plenty of water for
everyone, and that the West desperately needs electricity.</TE>
<TE>   The agency will decide later this year if it will grant a permit for
the water use.</TE>
<TE>   The aquifer is the sole source of drinking water for about 400,000
people in the two states.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute highlights a major policy difference between Idaho, which
has business-friendly laws, and Washington, where growth management
restraints have been in place for years.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has effectively placed a moratorium on issuing water
permits. But Idaho continues to consider large water-use requests.</TE>
<TE>   The states have no legal agreement on how to divide the trillions of
gallons of water in the aquifer. Thus, each state can issue permits for
water use without consulting the other.</TE>
<TE>   This has never posed a problem before, said Dick Larsen, spokesman for
the Idaho water agency.</TE>
<TE>   The Rathdrum Prairie, just east of Spokane across the Idaho border, is
a sliver of flat land between the Bitterroot and Selkirk mountains. There
is a confluence of natural gas and electrical transmission lines there
that make the prairie a natural spot for new power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Cogentrix wants to take 7 million gallons per day to cool the
gas-fired turbines of a proposed 810-megawatt plant.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate application, to be heard in March, California-based
Newport Northwest wants to take 10 million gallons of water per day to
cool a 1,300-megawatt natural gas-fired plant in the same area.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Spokane-based Avista wants to take nearly 3 million gallons
per day to enlarge and convert a part-time power plant to full-time
production.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the plants would consume about one-eighth of the average
daily draw from the aquifer.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Geological Survey estimated in the 1980s that the aquifer
contained up to 10 trillion gallons of water, which was withdrawn at a
daily average of 160 million gallons. Peak summer use was 450 million
gallons per day, the USGS estimated.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know how much water is down there," Osborn contended. "We
need to do some studies before we make allocations of this size."</TE>
<TE>   The aquifer starts near the southern end of Lake Pend Oreille in Idaho
and resurfaces in Washington, where it replenishes the Spokane and Little
Spokane rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Grover, regional director for the Washington Department of
Ecology in Spokane, said state officials are satisfied their Idaho
counterparts will do a good job of considering all impacts before they
issue a permit. For that reason, the Ecology Department will not testify
at this month's hearing, Grover said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the water withdrawals don't seem that great considering the
trillions of gallons the aquifer is thought to hold, Grover said that is
misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Most industrial or agricultural users eventually return used water to
the rivers. But the water used to cool the turbines would turn into steam
and escape into the atmosphere, Grover said.</TE>
<TE>   "What will be the effect on the flows of the Spokane River?" Grover
said. "Will they be noticeably diminished?"</TE>
<TE>   Cogentrix contends the aquifer is regularly replenished, and the
withdrawals will not harm that cycle, Freeman said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the power plants have found allies in construction
workers, who fear the projects will drain so much water that there won't
be enough left to accommodate future growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Water is our region's number one natural resource," said Timm Ormsby
of the Building and Construction Trades Council, a labor union for
construction workers.</TE>
<TE>   The union contends that most of the construction jobs on the power
plants will likely go to specialized workers from out-of-state, and that
the completed plants require very few employees.</TE>
<TE>   Cogentrix filed a motion in December asking Idaho to refuse to hear
any evidence at the Feb. 11 hearing on how large aquifer withdrawals
might hurt people in Washington. Idaho regulators in mid-January ruled
against Cogentrix and said they will consider such evidence, but only to
a point.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a proceeding on the equitable apportionment of water
between the states of Idaho and Washington," the Idaho agency said.</TE>
<TE>   No evidence on the division of water from the aquifer will be heard,
the agency said.</TE>

<HD>Creosote Bush May Have Roots in Antiquity</HD>
<DH>Nature: Scientist says shrub found near Palm Springs may be the
world's oldest living thing at a cool 11,000 years. Some remain
skeptical, however.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BRIDGES</AU>

<DL>PALM SPRINGS
</DL>
<LD>Along an unremarkable stretch of desert on the outskirts of town,
just off a road named for singing cowboy Gene Autry and tucked amid heaps
of garbage raked by winds strong enough to polish granite, Jim Cornett
thinks he's found the world's oldest living thing.</LD>
<LD>   Radiocarbon tests now underway may reveal the unassuming creosote bush
sprouted 11,000 or more years ago, the scientist said, meaning it could
rival in age another creosote bush growing 50 miles away in the Mojave
Desert.</LD>
<LD>   The scraggly creosote pales in comparison to the grandeur of
well-known ancients such as the gnarled bristlecone pine and majestic
coast redwood.</LD>
<TE>   Seemingly more dead than alive, the bush isn't big and certainly isn't
tall. It isn't even very bushy.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not very exciting," Cornett admitted.</TE>
<TE>   What the creosote bush is, Cornett is fairly certain, is ancient.</TE>
<TE>   If confirmed, the bush--really a 38-foot, arrow-straight line of
genetically identical bushes connected at the roots--could trump another
creosote bush, dubbed "King Clone." That bush, found in 1980 to be 11,700
years old, is considered the oldest living thing on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone ever thought a bush would be that old," said
Cornett, curator of natural science at the Palm Springs Desert Museum.</TE>
<TE>   In a species that reproduces itself through cloning, any individual is
theoretically as old as the species. Take King's Holly, a rare Tasmanian
plant. In 1996, scientists found fossil remains of the plant near the
holly's only known population.</TE>
<TE>   The fossils were found to be 43,000 years old, suggesting the existing
plants had grown in that location for at least that long.</TE>
<TE>   A box huckleberry colony in Pennsylvania, spread over some 10 square
miles, is believed to date back as far as 13,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of King Clone and the bush now being studied, scientists
traced one bush, not a population, back in time.</TE>
<TE>   UC Riverside botanist Frank Vasek discovered King Clone. Over the
millenniums, it had grown outward into a large ring.</TE>
<TE>   Vasek, now retired, said he doubted there were any creosotes older
than King Clone.</TE>
<TE>   "The way human activity is devastating the area, it is unlikely they
would survive that onslaught," Vasek said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Van Devender, senior research scientist at the Arizona-Sonora
Desert Museum in Tucson, Ariz., said the newly found bush could well be
older than King Clone. And he doesn't believe King Clone is as old as
scientists claim. He believes it is closer to 7,500 years or younger.
That's still older than the oldest bristlecone--by several thousand
years.</TE>
<TE>   Cornett's bush grows differently than the ring-like King Clone,
thanks, he said, to the merciless winds that howl through the northern
outskirts of Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   There, the wind is strong enough to smooth the granite boulders that
pepper the garbage-strewn landscape and drive the blades of hundreds of
power-generating windmills in the area. It also gives the creosote bush
its streamlined shape.</TE>
<TE>   On this patch of federal land, the bush struggles with the wind to
grow outward, but none of the sprouts that grow from roots fanning out
under the coarse sand survive--save those lucky enough to come up behind
the windbreak formed by the original plant.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time it puts out a sprout to the side, it gets obliterated,"
Cornett said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the centuries, the bush has formed a long line of clones. When
the lead bush dies, it leaves the second in the chain to take the brunt
of the wind.</TE>
<TE>   Cornett and his colleagues first spotted the linear bush while flying
over the northern outskirts of Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   The root samples being tested by Cornett came from beneath the soil
upwind of the living bush, and presumably belonged to a genetically
identical predecessor that died thousands of years ago. The trace remains
of roots linking the living and dead portions of the bush support that
hypothesis, Cornett said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a spectacular claim, but Cornett is a well-respected
scientist and I would say, run with it," said Richard Felger, executive
director of the Drylands Institute in Tucson, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   The creosote bush, Larrea tridentata, is the hallmark perennial of the
warm deserts of North and South America. When crushed, or after a
rainfall, its small, waxy leaves give off the pungent, petroleum-like
smell that gives it its name.</TE>
