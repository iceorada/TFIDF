<HD>Party to Say, 'It's a Wonderful Midlife'</HD>
<DH>For many, turning 40 is the time to celebrate in a major
way</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN GREGG GILMORE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Admitting you're 40 years old, according to an anonymous Hallmark
greeting card philosopher, takes courage, confidence, a positive
attitude and at least five or six years to accomplish. Maybe it was
once that way. But more and more, this midlife milestone is a great
excuse for a party.</LD>
<LD>   My 40th birthday bash took on a nature theme: 16 virgin campers
pitching their tents by a quiet lake, finding more comfort in a
freshly grilled salmon and a bottle of chardonnay than in their
never-before-used Eddie Bauer equipment.</LD>
<LD>   During the past year, as more of my friends have faced 40, I have
bowled, boated, golfed and discoed my way through a seemingly
never-ending round of celebratory soirees--the next birthday girl or
boy not to be outdone by the last.</LD>
<TE>   From New York to L.A., those of us bringing up the rear of the
baby-boomer generation are kicking off our 41st year with more hoopla
than most of our parents would have ever deemed appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Kent Brasloff, a New York interior designer,
orchestrated a three-day birthday extravaganza in honor of his 40th.
Beginning with a smallish get-together for 25 out-of-town guests at a
chic Italian restaurant, the festivities culminated with a
maharajah's garden-themed ball held in a palm-filled city loft. The
dress code suggested the wearing of turbans and tiaras; and,
according to the host, officials of the Miss America Pageant
graciously supplied loaner tiaras for those without their own.</TE>
<TE>   Brasloff spent six months planning and fine-tuning every detail,
from the bacon-wrapped pickled watermelon rinds to the peacock
feathers sprouting from the top of a three-tiered cake. He spent more
than $30,000 for what he called "the most perfect three days of my
life."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so boomers can be a bit self-indulgent--the experts have been
known to use the word "narcissistic."</TE>
<TE>   "But for this generation, the 40th birthday party is definitely
about things being bigger and better," said Richard Laermer, whose
examination of societal trends is the subject of his recent book,
"Trendspotting" (Penguin Putnam, 2002). "Many of us think of this as
the last big birthday party we'll throw for ourselves," Laermer said.
"It's not that we're going to die, but we just don't see ourselves
doing this grand of a thing at 50 or 60 years old."</TE>
<TE>   Karla Swatek, who recently hosted a 40th birthday party for her
husband at their La Costa home, believes there's good reason for a
party, particularly in Southern California. "I think people age
better here and are younger at heart, so turning 40 is cause for
celebration, not depression," said the La Jolla-based book publicist.
"I'll save the depression for 50."</TE>
<TE>   For her husband's party, Swatek opted for a Mardi Gras theme with
Cajun cuisine, New Orleans-style cocktails and a fortuneteller.
Swatek, too, has been a guest at numerous 40th shindigs, from a
recent cruise to Mexico to a middle-aged prom. She admits that when
it comes to planning a 40th birthday party, there is definitely a
feeling of one-upmanship within her social circle--a no-holds-barred,
competitive spirit likened only to the planning of a son's bar
mitzvah or a daughter's wedding.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my friends are looking to make a big splash," Swatek
said. "After all, 40 just isn't what it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   True, even in our youth-worshipping culture, 40 has taken on a new
look. Sexy, vibrant, botoxed role models from Madonna to Cher have
confronted these 40-something years with stomachs fully bared. And
though they may have helped convince us that turning 40 is not the
beginning of the end, for many of us there is still fear attached to
the number and the aging process. In fact, these elaborate birthday
celebrations may be a sort of catered coping mechanism.</TE>
<TE>   "These big parties are actually a reflection of our fears about
aging and our own mortality," said Susan Krauss Whitbourne, professor
of psychology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The
planning occupies our mental energy for months, and the party itself
may make the day a little easier, said Whitbourne, an expert in adult
psychological development. But remember, at the end of the day, you
are still 40.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with having a lavish party, but you need to
go into it with your eyes wide open so you're prepared for the
emotional cleanup after the guests all leave," Whitbourne said.
"Forty is just a number. You are no different than you were the day
before or the day after," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Whitbourne also said that the September terrorist attacks continue
to change many of our attitudes about mortality. Now, more people may
be choosing to take something bittersweet, like turning 40, and
transform it into something pleasurable, she said.</TE>
<TE>   For several years, Janie and Mark Herzog casually talked about the
most memorable way to celebrate Mark's recent 40th birthday. After
considering their options, the Pasadena couple decided on a quiet
European vacation.</TE>
<TE>   But on Sept. 11, Mark, who owns a television production company,
was walking through the American Airlines terminal at New York's La
Guardia Airport. He looked out the terminal's window just in time to
witness the attack on the World Trade Center's south tower.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, from that moment, the whole concept of us traveling
together, of being so far away from our two children, made us very
uncomfortable," said Janie, a publicist in the film industry. So two
months before Mark's June birthday, they changed their plans and
decided to have a party at home.</TE>
<TE>   Now the birthday boy wanted only family, friends and fun. And when
the Pasadena police showed up at midnight requesting that the music
be turned down, Mark knew he'd ushered in 40 as he had
hoped--memorably.</TE>

<LD>Tesia spends almost every day at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Cypress,
located across the street from her apartment. Several staff members
of the club have talked to the 12-year-old's mother by phone but most
have not met her.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't go to places where there are a lot of people because I
get panic attacks," said the mother, Sheila, who says her failing
eyesight restricts her from leaving her home.</LD>
<LD>   "When the mom is not feeling well, basically, the mom stays in
bed," said Lupe Bravo, director of operations for the club. "You've
got a child who comes home and makes breakfast, lunch and dinner for
herself."</LD>
<TE>   There are no other family members close by to step in--Tesia's
father lives out-of-state and rarely visits.</TE>
<TE>   She copes with her mother's limitations by turning to friends and
neighbors and trying to stay involved in school plays.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a very social person," said her mother, who added that her
daughter "is the kind of kid that is always busy doing something."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are times when the girl is more aware of her mother's
absence.</TE>
<TE>   "At school, she doesn't think about it, but when it comes time for
the play that she's been working so hard on, and other kids have
parents there, it does affect her," Bravo said.</TE>
<TE>   Tesia often acts as her mother's representative to the world by
carrying messages back and forth between her mother and the school
principal.</TE>
<TE>   "Tesia is her mom's spokesperson, but it is difficult to work with
Tesia as opposed to working with an adult," Bravo said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, for example, when she was in the fourth grade, Tesia
had to organize her own summer camp applications. She missed the
deadline for filling the necessary paperwork and had to spend the
summer in the city. She filed in time for this summer and will be
attending Pathfinder Ranch in Hemet.</TE>
<TE>   Being on her own so much can get Tesia into trouble just as with
any other kid. "We are authority to Tesia," Bravo said. "We need to
make her understand that even if Mom won't come, there are still
people who are going to make sure she knows right from wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Boys &amp; Girls Club is sending Tesia to camp, with the support
of The Times' summer camp campaign, to help her break out of the
isolation that surrounds her home life. The camp experience, Bravo
said, will help Tesia "to be productive and not get a reclusive and
'poor me' attitude. Hopefully, she'll be strong."</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp. This year more than
11,000 children will experience a special summer, thanks to the $1.6
million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA. 90074-6984. For more information, call
(213) 237-5771. To make credit-card donations, visit www.
latimes.com/summercamp. Do not send cash.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax-deductible. Unless donors request otherwise,
gifts of $25 or more are acknowledged in The Times. The summer-camp
campaign is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the
McCormick Tribune Foundation.</TE>

<LD>Across L.A.'s great basin we head. Bell. South Gate. Downey. The
glorious Los Angeles River off to our right, a concrete trench that's
dry as your stepmother's kiss. The L.A. River. Little Muddy.</LD>
<LD>   "Good fishing, that river," I tell the little girl.</LD>
<LD>   "It is?" she asks.</LD>
<TE>   It's early Saturday morning and we are on our way to yet another
softball tournament. Yes, this deep into summer, we're still playing
softball. Maple leaves are shriveling in the July heat. The moms are
tan as moccasins. Yet, we march on, a song on our sunburned lips.</TE>
<TE>   "Old man river, he keeps on flowin'," I sing as we follow the L.A.
River.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad?"</TE>
<TE>   "Huh?"</TE>
<TE>   "Are we almost there?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, you're never there. Tournament softball is like the
Deadhead tour that doesn't end, 15 all-stars and their parents
barnstorming from town to town.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, Downey. Next weekend, Northridge. Most Hell's Angels
don't see this much pavement.</TE>
<TE>   On the way to Downey, we listen to the radio, flipping between
news of Wall Street and the stuff that passes for music these days.
It's no wonder I'm butchering old show tunes.</TE>
<TE>   "Old man river, he keeps on flowin' ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Dad?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get stocks," says the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   So I explain the stock market to her, how once upon a time people
would buy shares of great companies, and, when those companies did
well, the people would make money.</TE>
<TE>   A great joy swept the land. With very little effort, people could
build quite a nest egg, even people of dubious skill and social
worth. Stockbrokers. Columnists. Anybody.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all profit based," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "It was?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, stock prices are mostly based on performance."</TE>
<TE>   Then the joy stopped, I tell her. Scandals broke out. People who
ran the companies lied about how well the companies were doing. No
one was sure what anything was worth.</TE>
<TE>   "They cooked the books," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "Yuck," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "You said it."</TE>
<TE>   "That's so sad," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Things will get better," I assure her.</TE>
<TE>   The little girl pauses and thinks about the world economy. Her
role in it. The $2 blueberry muffin crumbled in her lap. Life. Must
be more to it than she thought.</TE>
<TE>   "I still don't get stocks," she says with a sigh.</TE>
<TE>   At the tournament site, we pull in next to painted cars. What
happens is that teams will paint players' names on the windows of
minivans and Suburbans with shoe polish. Hannah. Courtney. Megan.
This creates a certain amount of pride and team enthusiasm. It also
mucks up your windows.</TE>
<TE>   "How do people see out?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "We should paint our windows," the little girl says.</TE>
<TE>   "Our windows are dirty enough," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Today, we play two games. As always, the other team seems
older--big girls, far heftier than our own. In softball, a sensible
dietary regimen seems to work against you.</TE>
<TE>   "Never miss a meal, those girls," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Doughnut?" asks Coach Tom.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Thwack. Thwack. Thwack.</TE>
<TE>   Hear that? That's the other team's pitcher warming up. It's the
sound of a sharp ax striking an oak log. Thwack. Thwack. Thwack.</TE>
<TE>   "We can hit this girl," says Coach Glynn.</TE>
<TE>   "We can?" asks Abby.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure we can," says Coach Chuck.</TE>
<TE>   "Really?" says Amanda.</TE>
<TE>   Sure we can, though our players are largely unconvinced. They get
up from the bench with the reluctance of a pregnant woman getting out
of a canoe. They tiptoe to the on-deck circle. They stand at the
plate, swinging late with their overpriced aluminum bats.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on fire today," I tell Coach Tom.</TE>
<TE>   "Another doughnut?" Coach Tom asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Our coaches take a largely holistic approach to sports. We stress
all the usual fundamentals: hitting, fielding, spitting. We also,
during slow times, prep the kids for the SATs. You can never start
too early.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, where's the tibula?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no tibula," says Ruth, a left fielder of some promise.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't?"</TE>
<TE>   "There's the fibula and the tibia," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Her dad's a doctor," says Robin, a steady right fielder.</TE>
<TE>   "Next question," says Ruth.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, we're here for softball. But it's a great little
tournament, full of wry observations and bad dugout jokes. If that's
not enough, there's a grill with burgers and hotdogs. At another
booth, roasted corn.</TE>
<TE>   Here at Independence Park in Downey, they have four fine softball
fields shoehorned into a tight area. It promotes intimacy and
friendship. I can read the tattoos of people I would not otherwise
read. We share each other's Friday night hangovers.</TE>
<TE>   In the two days of the tournament, I spot only one ugly incident
involving screaming parents, but it quickly ends. After 30 seconds of
yelling, they sit back to let the summer's heat collect in their
shoes. Married, probably.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend's only real flaw comes at the end, when the Downey
Police Department leaves a love note on my wife's windshield.
Thirty-five bucks, it says. Illegal parking. Thanks, officer. Way to
support youth sports.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no other places," my wife explains to me.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to respect the law," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "When's the next time I'm going to be in Downey," she says. "They
can come look for me."</TE>
<TE>   Great, now I'm harboring a fugitive. I'd turn her in, but then
what? She's pregnant, you know. You didn't? Yep, pregnant as a
sparrow in spring.</TE>
<TE>   Poor kid. They say jail is no place to raise a child, though we've
had mixed results as well in our tree-lined little suburb.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I think I won't turn my wife in. Things will get better.
She'll learn to respect the law. She'll pay her debt to society
(assuming we have any money left at the end of the week).</TE>
<TE>   Besides, she's never more beautiful than when she's pregnant. And
rarely more alive.</TE>
<TE>   Life. As always, there's more to it than you think.</TE>

<HD>Better to Have Left 911 Tape Unheard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My husband and I were heading east on the 10, our children asleep in
the back seat, the rest of the car full of sleeping bags and lanterns
and Trader Joe's sacks, when one of the local radio stations began
discussing the killing of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion. The station
played the 911 call from the young man who found the girl's body. The
station billed it as "exclusive" but later we found out the tape was
being aired on stations all over. It was announced so quickly--right
after a bit of news concerning the arrest made in the case--that I
didn't have time to turn it off, so that poor young man's voice
filled our car with heartbreak and horror while outside mega-malls
and billboards flashed by.</LD>
<LD>   It was the single worst thing I have ever heard on the radio, and
that comes after a year in which we have all heard, and seen, some
pretty horrible things. I still can't think of it, even as I write
this, without the skin tightening around my eyes, behind my ears,
without wanting to literally shake my head to jar the memory of it
from my brain. And I only heard it once.</LD>
<TE>   Part of my reaction may be due to motherhood--I have two young
children and so this crime has left me frightened and angry, aware of
the ruthless and arbitrary nature of fate, just as Sept. 11 did. In a
minute, through no fault of my own, my life could change tragically
and irrevocably. Hearing the tape, I thought I would be sick, and
when the nausea passed, I spent the rest of the day feeling angry and
upset in a queasy, shivery way that, in the end, was not a reaction
to the crime so much as it was to the tape. I had no business hearing
that call. No one, except the poor dispatcher whose shift it was that
terrible day, had any business hearing that call. There was no
purpose served by the media's constant repetition of that poor man's
attempt to do the right thing and get through what must have been one
of the worst experiences of his life.</TE>
<TE>   What made me sick that day was not the horror of the crime--I had
been well aware of that for days--but that the industry in which I
work was going to milk it. There are times when it is necessary to
show the human toll a tragedy takes, to expose the grisly details or
broadcast the reactions of a witness or even a victim, in the hopes
that it will ensure that the public does not dismiss human suffering
as necessary or banal. God, we are told, is in the details, and
giving a human voice to what could easily become numbers or faceless
people in a far-off place is an important, if difficult, purpose of
journalism.</TE>
<TE>   But this was not the case of this tape. No sentient human being
was unaware that a monstrous crime had been committed. Broadcasting
that tape offered no new information or insight, except perhaps to
prove that coming upon the body of a child is a mind-unhinging event.</TE>
<TE>   Not all information is for public consumption and the gatekeeper
role of journalist is constantly being reexamined and redefined. Back
and forth the pundits went over the airing of the videotape that
showed the execution of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl,
and there isn't a city editor or photo editor in the country who
hasn't agonized over whether a detail or photo from a crime scene had
pushed past the line of illumination into the fen of exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to say that all 911 calls should be
off-limits--why should we hear the agonies of others when an
explanation of the details would suffice? But, of course, there are
times when terror or heroism or the sound of gunfire is vital to
public understanding of an event. In making these decisions, context
is important--as many media outlets found during the 9/11 tragedy, if
you're going to expose fresh wounds to the public soul, you probably
don't want to then cut to a SigAlert on the 405. The experience of
receiving horrific news is different when you're in the car. There is
nowhere to go, no physical distraction, nothing to do except brood.</TE>
<TE>   To air a tape like that, news directors should be darn sure it's
the public's business. And the sound of a young man's horror upon
making such a terrible discovery just wasn't.</TE>

<HD>In Down Times, a Publication for Living Rich</HD>
<DH>From the upscale Robb Report, it would seem the reading
wealthy are weathering this uncertain climate just fine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faith is easily shaken; hope fades; charity, sadly, is forever in
short supply.</LD>
<LD>   But Schadenfreude--that quiet glee in the misfortune of others--is
always with us.</LD>
<LD>   So, with stocks groping for a bottom, bonds wallowing and the
dollar falling, it seems like the right moment to check in on the
reading rich. And there probably isn't a better place to do that than
at the Malibu-based Robb Report, whose slightly more than 100,000
monthly readers have an average annual income of $1.2 million. Thick,
glossy and pricey, the magazine is dedicated to the proposition that
the good life, if not entirely about things, is mostly so.</LD>
<TE>   How are the Robb Report and its acquisitive readers doing?</TE>
<TE>   Never better and just fine, according to William J. Curtis,
president and chief executive of CurtCo Robb Media, which in
partnership with Toronto Dominion Capital, acquired the magazine "for
the luxury lifestyle" a little more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Cartier and Patek Philippe are not going out of business because
of what's happening in the market," he said. "But what they and other
manufacturers of luxury products and services are being forced to do
is to focus their marketing on those people who can afford to pull
the trigger on a purchase, even in this market. In this difficult
climate, image advertising--the sort aimed at the wannabes making
$100,000 a year--falls away a bit, and advertising that results in
sales survives."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the Robb Report--however rarified its
readership--represents a return to form for a little-noticed
publishing success story that Curtis, a onetime ad salesman for the
Financial Times, planted in Malibu more than a decade ago. Over the
succeeding years, he and a small group of associates launched or
acquired 26 specialty publications focused on home theaters,
computing and mobile computing, particularly in the
business-to-business sector. "Sales Force Automation Magazine was one
of our titles," Curtis quipped. "There's something you'd want to curl
up with by the fire on a cold night."</TE>
<TE>   Those titles were all sold off by 1999 to become an e-commerce
firm.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time," Curtis recalled, "it was everybody's obligation to
find a way to lose money. So, like everybody else, we started a
business that wasn't really a business. It was called Small
Office.com, and I lost $10 million on it.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned our lesson from the dotcom and, at the end of 2000,
began the complicated process of acquiring this magazine, which I
love and have read for the last decade. We paid $35 million, and I'm
like a pig in heaven because I'm really into this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Curtis describes the Robb Report, which since its purchase has
undergone a redesign and major editorial expansion, as "nicely
profitable." Renewals have increased, and newsstand sales have
increased by 25% to 47,000--"and this is a book with an $8 to $10
cover price. This is not a $2 magazine. Overall, we're going to make
a couple of million dollars more than we projected this year." As a
privately held company, CurtCo does not publish financial
projections.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though Curtis and his associates believe the current upheaval
in the markets may last for another two years, they plan to use the
magazine--which is filled with lavishly illustrated pieces on hotels,
restaurants, cars, boats, jewelry, watches, cigars and wine--as the
launching pad for an array of publications geared to high-end
consumerism. "I would very much like to acquire a home design and
furniture title," he said, "because our readers' second homes have an
average value of $2.5 million."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Asserts 'Anti-Catholic Bias'</TE>
<TE>   With Pope John Paul II in Toronto for a world youth festival, the
Holy See is reportedly still weeks away from any formal pronouncement
on the guidelines recently adopted by the American bishops for
dealing with pedophile clerics.</TE>
<TE>   That silence has not halted some influential Vatican insiders from
continuing to assert that the child-abuse crisis is the product of an
anti-Catholic frenzy in the U.S. news media.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Jesuit-run Roman journal Civilta Cattolica, whose
articles are approved by the Vatican secretariat of state, accused
American journalists of a "morbid and scandalous curiosity" in the
issue and alleged the media's "anti-Catholic bias" has subjected the
church "to a cross-fire of suspicions, violent accusations,
recriminations and demands for million-dollar settlements."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with an influential Catholic magazine, 30 Giorni
(30 Days), Cardinal Oscar Rodriquez Maradiaga--a Honduran sometimes
mentioned as a papal candidate--singled out the New York Times, the
Washington Post and Boston Globe as "protagonists of what I do not
hesitate to define as a persecution against the church." The U.S.
press, Rodriquez Maradiaga said, has acted "with a fury which reminds
me of the times of Diocletian and Nero and, more recently, Stalin and
Hitler." The Honduran prelate went on to hint that this persecution
stems, in part, from the American media's antipathy to the Vatican's
support for a Palestinian homeland.</TE>
<TE>   According to a column last week in his paper's online edition,
John L. Allen Jr., the Rome bureau chief for the National Catholic
Reporter, a lay newsweekly, wrote that some Vatican officials have
begun to go further and, in a particularly sinister turn, are
attributing the U.S. media's alleged anti-Catholicism to the large
number of Jewish reporters in the American press.</TE>
<TE>   One Catholic analyst who is not buying any of this is the Rev.
Thomas Reese, editor of leading Jesuit magazine America. "Actually, I
think, the U.S. news coverage has been pretty fair and the bishops
have received the coverage they deserve. I have not seen
anti-Catholicism in the news stories nor even in the commentary--not
in the traditional sense of the word. There's anti-clericism in some
quarters, but it's not the nativism of the bad old days."</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican, he said, "is 15 to 20 years behind our bishops in
understating child abuse as a crime, a sickness and an abdication
that cannot be cured by prayer or penance. You have to understand
where we were 30 years ago to understand where they are today. The
tragedy is that the church outside the United States is not learning
from our mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress:</TE>
<TE>   'Lady Madonna'</TE>
<TE>   Brian Lysaght, a lawyer and writer, is author of four novels, most
recently "Last Dance of the Viper."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm about halfway through my new novel, which has the working
title 'Lady Madonna.' One of its major characters--the villain, who's
called David Cole--is loosely inspired by Andrew Cunanan, Gianni
Versace's killer. For a thriller writer, like me, Cunanan is the sort
of real-life character who embodies chilling possibilities. He's a
shape-changer, sexually neutral and totally psychopathic. As a writer
of thrillers, you take those possibilities, magnify them and then
imagine in print what such a person might be like. Cole, who calls
himself 'Lady Madonna,' not only has the ability to effortlessly
shift sexual identities, but also is a Caltech-trained mathematical
genius and an accomplished magician--an illusionist. He also has been
a killer since boyhood. In other words, he is a nightmarish opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "One of his victims is Jonathan Hardley, a partner in a major
Century City tax and pension firm, who has been involved in
embezzlement. Along the way, Hardley encounters the villain Cole and
ends up with his throat slit. This puts our heroine, a deputy U.S.
attorney, into the thick of things along with one of the murdered
man's partners, a lawyer named Michael Flynn. Together, they pursue
the killer through the world of corrupt high finance and the sexual
underground.</TE>
<TE>   "Where they all come out remains to be seen."</TE>

<HD>His Observation Deck</HD>
<DH>Author John Ridley returns to view the Vegas he's made his
own, in life and fiction</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>John Ridley nurses no illusions. He'd be the first to tell you that
it's been quite some time since Vegas has been the Neverland of
pocket squares and peau-de-soie; since Rat Pack high style and high
jinks gave way to ... well ... Peter Frampton, and Vicki Lawrence as
"Mama," headlining in the Strip's plush main rooms.</LD>
<LD>   No matter. As a writer, he knows all one needs is inspiration. And
as a gambler, he knows you have to telegraph your intentions to
orchestrate just the right atmosphere. "Putting your money on the
table," Ridley lays out the rules, "is demonstrating your action."</LD>
<LD>   Fresh off the plane from L.A., standing at the taxi stand at
Mandalay Bay and thumbing through a thick fold of bills, Ridley is
ready for another weekend of conversation, cocktails, casino hopping
and come what may. Friday night in Vegas lies ahead like an open
stretch of desert road</LD>
<TE>   He's been on a roll of late. There's a new film in the theaters:
"Undercover Brother," for which he's got another screenwriter credit;
a new book on the shelves with his name on the jacket: "A
Conversation With the Mann" (Warner Books, 2002); and many more
manuscripts and pitches on the front burner. So he's come to Vegas to
check his baggage, literally and figuratively.</TE>
<TE>   More weekends than not, Ridley, 35, decides to trade the artifice
of Los Angeles for the artifice of Las Vegas--the hyper-unreal for
the hyper-surreal. Often in a heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   The author of four novels, he has found a hazy spot squeezed
between old Vegas and new Vegas, high Vegas and potboiler Vegas, and
made it his own--both in life and on the page. While some of his
previous novels sniffed around Vegas' seamier back streets, his new
book is set center stage in the golden age of clubs and carousing.</TE>
<TE>   For 10 years, Ridley's been returning, accumulating some of the
details that wound up in his "Conversation." Work doesn't interfere
with his visits. Marriage hasn't curtailed them. "I stay up here, she
[his wife, Gayle,] stays downtown. We have different tastes."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight he spins through a few possible scenarios: "I figure
dinner. A little gambling, maybe a live act. Or not ... ," he says,
eyes trained beyond the taxi's smoked glass and taking in Vegas'
oddly amalgamated skyline--the Sphinx, the Chrysler Building, the
Eiffel Tower. "There are times when I come here every weekend. I
couldn't imagine living so close and not."</TE>
<TE>   For Ridley, Vegas isn't as much a destination as a musical key, a
mood. And though that glittering necklace of grand-style casinos is
but a mirage, Ridley's tack is to find the reality below the rippling
air. Instead of a tipsy romp, the night life in his new novel is set
against the contours of the civil rights movement, and he's chosen a
struggling black comic, Jackie Mann, to be the eyes and ears of this
tale.</TE>
<TE>   There is a moment early in "A Conversation With the Mann" that is
as poignant as it is prescient. Mann, high on the laughs and applause
at the Sands' Copa Room, decides to venture onto the strictly
segregated casino floor:</TE>
<TE>   "More than anything in the world I wanted to gamble," says Jackie.
"Not for the jazz of laying the bet, or the sake of wagering money.
What I wanted was to stand at a table with all those people--suited
men, ladies in their best dresses--living high and living fast and
living Cocktail Society. I wanted to see them do a Red Sea-part as I
made my way to the roulette wheel and listened to all their
star-struck bits: 'Great job tonight, Jackie!' 'Heck of a show,
Jackie!' ... I wanted them to fawn and gush and throw me their love
same as they threw it at me when I was performing, when I was
standing three feet above.... Then I did it. No back-and-forth debate
with myself, no working my way to a decision. I just did it. I just
pushed open the doors and walked out of the Copa Room and into the
casino."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley's riffing on that very style: As he strides into the
casinos of the new Vegas, his Vegas, he still wants to test the
limits. That's the whole point, he figures. To push it. Shake it up.
He's learned that the many worlds he navigates are simply a
collection of high-stakes games that are as much about luck as
timing--skill, he believes, is irrelevant. And, like Mann, maybe, for
him the gamble is about more than the money. It's the heads turning,
and those "star-struck bits." It's the idea of being "three feet
above" it all--if only for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   He can make the waters part in Vegas. A nice suit, a big bet and
$200 tips all around ensure a trailing spotlight, gratitude, even
respect--Vegas style. Here, he's a winner, even when he loses. All
this runs counter to Hollywood and its inherent gamble, going to the
table and coming back on the downside.</TE>
<TE>   He scored big in 1999 with "Three Kings," but was infuriated when
George Clooney was cast in the lead, even though the character was
written as an African American male. (Though he wrote the original
screenplay, he protested changes and wound up with a "story by"
credit.)</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a problem with George Clooney," Ridley says, "But I
do have a problem when there are too few roles for black guys and
here's one.... They didn't even look" for a black star for the lead.</TE>
<TE>   And though "Undercover Brother" (based on his popular
UrbanEntertainment.com Internet series) has been a surprise summer
hit, he finds himself wishing that it were Jackie Mann--not the
prodigiously afro'd Undercover Brother who was propelling him through
the interview circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that we could have pushed it more. It was supposed to be
an in-your-face social satire.... They just saw it as Austin Powers."
His face goes from detached to joyless. "I didn't go to the
premiere.... I can't just smile and pretend that it was all great."</TE>
<TE>   Dancing Fountains</TE>
<TE>   He lightens somewhat as the taxi closes in on the Bellagio.
Through the revolving door, across the rose-lit casino, we arrive at
Shintaro, the hotel's tony Japanese restaurant. Passing a bank of
tanks filled with fluorescent jellyfish, we wind through a low-slung
dining room and toward a table with a sweeping view of the Strip in
stunning mid-transformation to after-5 glitter. "In a few minutes,"
he says glancing at his watch, "we'll get to see the dancing
fountains."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley knows this city's history and ritual, chapter and verse. He
recites it as some do a favorite poem. How and when the Strip began
to change. Who the high-rollers are. How to spot them. "It was
[casino developer] Steve Wynn--that whole trend of building a hotel
and putting big things in front of it," he says. Every hotel has its
gimmick.</TE>
<TE>   On cue, the waters shoot up, moving in sync like the June Taylor
dancers, to Elton John's "Your Song." Ridley watches. Not a smirk.
Not a smile. He appreciates the show, not the "irony" of it.</TE>
<TE>   Over tataki-style Kobe beef and a glass of pinot noir, Ridley
begins to thaw and riff. He's vibing on the hum. The room is a waltz
of types: high-rollers, swingers, tough guys, summer-break frat boys.
"See that guy over there?" he says, nodding toward a cozy banquette,
"He's got two women.... No one blinks. Here you've got so many people
from all over. What I really like about Vegas is that almost
everything is acceptable. I like to watch what people do with their
freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Vegas has changed remarkably in the decade he's been visiting. Who
wouldn't have wanted to be along for the ride "when you put on your
jacket and have a steak and do some gambling?" he asks. "But what you
see now are people in wife-beaters and flip-flops." The distinctive
high style has faded like an old snapshot. "Something like 60% of
revenues come from the slots. That's the old ladies, the tourists,
not the million-dollar credit lines."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley's introduction to Vegas was a day trip with an old high
school friend. He was put off at first. "The more I came, the more I
talked to people, it got to be interesting. I just love to listen to
people. How people talk. What they talk about. It's a big adult
playground."</TE>
<TE>   For all its cacophony, it is Ridley's best antidote for Hollywood
and its contradictions. "At home, all I do is work. Go to meetings.
Listen to notes. Here," he doesn't hedge, "I come to drink and to
gamble." To watch the waters to part.</TE>
<TE>   Crossing the casino, Ridley pulls a silver cell phone from his
pocket. He speaks briefly to his wife, who is in for the evening at
the California Hotel downtown. They sketch a plan for the next day.
Phone clamped shut, he's pulled toward the high-limit games. He makes
a turn around a nook dotted with baccarat tables, taking the pulse of
things, and settles at a table away from others.</TE>
<TE>   There sits a distinguished-looking dealer named Duke, adorned with
a fancy gold ring and a fanciful brogue. Ridley hands over a stack of
hundreds. The dealer counts four rows of five bills. A stack of chips
slides his way. He makes his wager, orders a Stoli Vanilla and OJ.
("It's like a 50-50 Bar"-- Creamsicle tasting--he explains) as Duke
begins to deal from the shoe.</TE>
<TE>   Each hand is more take than give. His stack dwindles. But he's
having fun, rapid-fire wisecracking--Preston Sturges-style--with the
dealers who have migrated from surrounding tables and now cluster
around him. He milks the moment, has a quick retort for everyone.
"There's a reason I come to gamble: so people nearby can say, 'Well,
at least I didn't do as bad as that guy!' "</TE>
<TE>   Duke takes pity and bellows out a consolation prize, a rap made
elegant with his brogue.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah," says Ridley. "Sort of like that Steely Dan song: I want a
song when I lose!"</TE>
<TE>   Pockets lighter, but spirits soaring, Ridley decides to forgo the
crowded taxi stand and instead hails a sleek Town Car. The driver
snakes through a collection of dim alleys, dropping us at the front
door of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. "An entirely different
scene," Ridley has promised. He's delivered.</TE>
<TE>   'Crazy All Weekend'</TE>
<TE>   At the stroke of midnight, its glowing blue, gold and green casino
floor swells with silhouettes. Ragged guitars and bass shake the
floorboards. Two days after the Who's bassist John Entwistle died in
a room upstairs, the place is far from spooked. "No one canceled,"
remarks one dealer. "It's been crazy all weekend."</TE>
<TE>   In one corner, soccer star Cobi Jones nurses a drink. On the other
side of the space, hard-core rapper DMX hovers over a blackjack
table. One of the dealers buttonholes Ridley: "Hey, man, I saw the
movie, really liked it." Though Ridley smiles warmly and offers
sincere thanks, his body language suggests something closer to
unease.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley finds a game of baccarat. A man in the corner has amassed a
stack of chips that resembles a skyline. Ridley joins in, drawing
from his house credit. Ordering another drink, he quickly takes
another drubbing. His thoughts wander: "I wonder if we can get into
Entwistle's room." His eyes cut through the dimness looking for his
friend the manager. "Can we see a room?"</TE>
<TE>   A beat. "Oh, that room. Nah! It's got tape all around it!"</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get in there."</TE>
<TE>   "Man, you can't get in there. I can't get in there."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I'll get in there," he promises. "Eventually."</TE>
<TE>   He's down $1,600, irritated by the crush and the noise, and money
has moved from abstraction to all too real. He folds, cashes in.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the taxi line stretches--Ridley's face registers
something close to annoyance. But before he inquires, a car sweeps
up, offering another driver with an open smile and a well-planned
escape route: "Where do you want to go?"</TE>
<TE>   Recalling Old Times</TE>
<TE>   Ridley knows that just 40 years ago, he wouldn't have been allowed
to sit across a cocktail table in any lounge along the Strip talking
to a reporter. Not about his movies. Not about television shows. Not
about his books. Not about anything.</TE>
<TE>   That's why in many ways, he has been aching to tell Jackie Mann's
story for more than a decade. "It started as a screenplay," he
recalls of "A Conversation With the Mann," working on a daiquiri in
one of the overstuffed chairs in Mandalay Bay's Orchid Lounge. "The
bones of the story didn't change," he says. "When people think about
Vegas in those years, they think about Sinatra, Sammy and Dean
Martin. I wanted people to think about the civil rights movement"
that was gathering force in the wings. "I started talking to people.
Reading books." Drinking up the era.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Jackie's persona is a pop-culture synthesis of
mid-20th century America--the comedian Jack Carter's loquacious
circuit stories, the jazz-hipster patter of Chet Baker and, of
course, the biography of Sammy Davis Jr., who challenged the
entertainment world's color bar. "I love to write fact-tion--Elroy
does it. Doctorow. Why not do it with a black comedian?"</TE>
<TE>   Ridley admits he sees Jackie's desire to corral success--and his
understanding of what one might wager for it--as similar to his own
high-stakes give-and-take with the industry. He, too, started out as
a stand-up during comedy's boom years in the '80s. He saw the kind of
juice that notoriety would bestow. "Jackie wants the world to love
him ... and I wanted to be famous, just like Jackie."</TE>
<TE>   He's a veteran of the ups and downs that come with a long run.
He's written for sitcoms--"Martin," "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." He
was a producer on NBC's "Third Watch." And Oliver Stone made "Stray
Dogs," his first novel, into "U-Turn." But now he has a more
tentative relationship with Hollywood's promises and preoccupations.
"I used to love movies. But now you've got 15 people telling you what
they want--'It should be pink.' 'No, it should be blue.' It's like
loving a magic trick until you find out how it works."</TE>
<TE>   A Place for Gamblers</TE>
<TE>   The corridor of white blinking lights trimming Fremont Street
looks like spilled champagne. "Here," says Ridley, walking the length
of California Hotel, "the ceilings are lower, the light is dimmer."
The room is set up less for mood than for function, the bulk of the
gamblers packed in, transfixed by slots or the bright blue of
video-poker screens.</TE>
<TE>   Though this cluster of older casinos holds onto the raw animus of
Vegas, there have been major renovations. A metal canopy covers a
cluster of fast-food restaurants and crowded tchotchke shops. Ridley,
not surprisingly, isn't thrilled with the alterations. But what he
does love swirls around him, and trumps it all.</TE>
<TE>   As Ridley enters the Plaza, his eyes trail a man in an
electric-blue sequined zoot suit and white fedora as he cuts through
the busy tables. Gamblers smoke cigarettes down to the filter. One
sign advertises wet T-shirt contests; another, gambling lessons. "Oh,
they want you to learn," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   He considers poker or pai gow but somehow finds himself wandering
back to the baccarat table. When the waitress comes by, he orders a
Stoli Vanilla and O.J., but here, while there is O.J., there is no
vanilla Stoli. So Ridley settles for straight vodka and juice and
leans in. The Sunspots, a sextet with boot-black hair, play the nook
in the room dubbed the "Main Lounge" and the lead singer, an Asian
man, in a startling Louis Armstrong imitation, launches into a
reassuring rendition of "What a Wonderful World."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley is finally winning.</TE>
<TE>   As we step out of the Plaza, Sammy's big voice bounces off the
buildings. The champagne lights have dimmed, and the bottom of the
Fremont Street canopy is alight with an animated image of a man in a
bowler hat dancing to Sammy's famous turn on Mr. Bojangles. Segueing
into the light-show soundtrack of course, is the chairman of the
board. Frank Sinatra serenades the dusty and sweaty, the tank-topped
and the flip-flopped, with the classic "Luck Be a Lady." Ridley
stares up, transfixed, Frank's face spinning like a lucky penny
above.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't there for Paris in the '20s or New York in the '50s. But
I have Vegas," he says. "So much of it is almost gone. It's a scene
that I want to be a part of. I mean it's cool to understand
something. When I need to believe, when I need to be around people,
to see how they look and act. How they talk. That has not changed. I
sort of like being a Vegas guy."</TE>

<LD>   Peter was thinking. "I guess they don't want to be mean. You said
the chick has to find food for himself, Uncle Stanley. Is this how he
learns?"</LD>
<LD>   Uncle Stanley patted his shoulder. "Good for you, Peter! If they
didn't stop, the chick would never learn to fly or to fish for
squid."</LD>

<TE>   "You're not a wild bird, Sally," Uncle Stanley said. "When you
were a baby and were ready to walk, your parents let you take your
first steps alone because you had to learn. You just needed
practice."</TE>
<TE>   Sally thought about that. "I hope that chick is practicing. Can we
bring him something to eat?"</TE>
<TE>   "We can come see him, but we can't bring him anything to eat. He
has to learn to fly so that he can feed himself. Taking him food
would spoil nature's plan."</TE>
<TE>   Early next morning the children and Uncle Stanley found a woman
sitting on the cliff top watching their chick walk around his nest.</TE>

whispered. "He'll have to fly soon now."</TE>
<TE>   "What's a fledgling?" Peter asked.</TE>
<TE>   "A young bird that's left the nest. This one's been practicing
flying all morning but he's having a hard time getting off the
ground," Fran said. "He must be hungry because he keeps trying."</TE>

<HD>Fact and Friction: What Goes Into Your Brakes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB WEBER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no use firing up the engine of your car or truck and going
somewhere if you can't stop when you get there. That may lead you to
believe that the brakes are more important than the engine--though
that was not always the case.</LD>
<LD>   At first, most cars' top speed was less than 10 mph, so stopping
usually meant withdrawing engine power. But as speeds increased,
brakes became necessary and were patterned after those on horse-drawn
wagons.</LD>
<LD>   At the turn of the century, brakes were lined with friction
materials such as wood and leather. Though leather did a good job of
stopping the vehicle, it wore out quickly. Neither wood nor leather
was much good when wet. Sometimes, drivers would look for something
to hit in order to stop.</LD>
<TE>   As brakes evolved, leather gave way to camel hair and cotton cloth
impregnated with asphalt and rubber, but these linings occasionally
caught fire. Then, late in the first decade of the 1900s, something
that worked very well came along: asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   Brakes operate by changing kinetic energy (the energy of motion)
into heat energy. Touch your brakes after use, and you will be
convinced. Heat, however, can wreak havoc with the brake system by
wearing out the linings and damaging the iron drums and rotors. If
too much heat builds up, it can even boil the brake fluid.</TE>
<TE>   That made asbestos an excellent material for brake linings. It has
good friction properties, dissipates heat well, provides good pedal
feel and is cheap and durable. But it was blamed for causing lung
disease and banned in the mid-'80s.</TE>
<TE>   Though the dust created as brakes wore was not generally
considered a health hazard to the motoring public, it was a
significant workplace hazard for brake technicians and the people who
worked in auto manufacturing plants.</TE>
<TE>   The last couple of decades have seen a lot of changes in brake
friction materials. The material that brake manufacturers attach to
the brake shoes or disc backing plates is much like a cake batter
with a variety of ingredients:</TE>
<TE>   * Friction materials. They provide the needed grip.</TE>
<TE>   * Friction modifiers. With too much friction, the brakes would
grab, so materials such as cashew shell oils, walnut shells and
graphite are mixed with powdered metals such as zinc, brass and
aluminum. In general, these are called semi-metallic brakes.</TE>
<TE>   * Binders. These are the adhesive, the glue, that holds everything
together. Phenolic resins are the most common. By the way, the resins
are what makes that acrid odor if the brakes are overused and
overheated.</TE>
<TE>   If you have ever followed a truck down a long hill, you will never
forget the smell.</TE>
<TE>   * Fillers. The substances, such as rubber chips, that
manufacturers add for a variety of purposes, including pedal feel and
noise reduction.</TE>
<TE>   * Curing agents. They ensure that everything cooks up perfectly in
manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   Most brakes today have semi-metallic linings that offer good
braking when cold or hot; resist "fade," or loss of braking; and give
long life. Semi-metallics' main ingredient often is powdered iron or
steel fibers (like chopped steel wool).</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest problems with semi-metallics: They are dirty.
They leave that dark dust--brake crumbs--all over those nice alloy
and chrome wheels, especially on wheels with disc brakes. And
semi-mets tend to make noise.</TE>
<TE>   As the quest continues for better brake friction material, the
latest development is ceramic linings. Ceramic disc pads, first used
as original equipment in the mid- '80s, are becoming more popular;
some are available to retrofit vehicles that didn't originally come
with them.</TE>
<TE>   Ceramic pads with copper fibers fade even less than semi-mets at
high temperatures, cool faster and wear longer. They also are
quieter. And they don't create that dark dust that looks so awful on
your wheels; the dust is much lighter in color and has less tendency
to stick to wheels.</TE>

<HD>Citing a Need for Speed</HD>
<DH>CHP officers will show off racing vehicles at fund-raiser</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't look now, but the California Highway Patrol officer who gave
you a ticket for speeding on the freeway Tuesday might be the same
fire-breathing drag truck driver revving his 1,300-horsepower engine
in the lane next to you at the Saturday night drags in Palmdale.</LD>
<LD>   The leather-clad rider rumbling along next to you on your Sunday
motorcycle ride along Mulholland Highway in the Santa Monica
Mountains might be the same 'cycle cop who busted your best friend
for reckless road racing.</LD>
<LD>   Their day jobs may be as traffic enforcement pros in uniform, but
after hours, many of the same CHP officers are gearheads who enjoy
the roar of a well-tuned V-8 or the challenge of a hot bike on a
curvy road as much as you do.</LD>
<TE>   Doubt it?</TE>
<TE>   Then turn out Sunday at the Petersen Automotive Museum, when
scores of CHP personnel show off their personal rides in a
fund-raiser, sponsored by the Automobile Club of Southern California,
for the CHP 11-99 Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit organization was created 20 years ago to provide
benefits for CHP personnel and their dependents or survivors during
times of financial need.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Mick Rotondo, commander of the patrol's Visalia division,
will be there with the 1966 Mustang he bought for $400 and turned
into a show-winning replica of a rare Shelby GT 350 "Hertz" Mustang,
doing all the work, except a few engine operations, on weekends in
his home shop.</TE>
<TE>   So will Gary Smith, a CHP sergeant from Murietta who has spent
countless hours and nearly $100,000 of his own money building his
fiberglass-bodied, tube-framed drag truck.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who spends much of his free time taking the truck to car
shows and special events to promote the anti-drug and
anti-street-racing programs he's involved with, said he fell in love
with cars and drag racing as the 16-year-old son of an Illinois
deputy sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   His black truck, with a supercharged 1,300-horsepower engine that
gulps alcohol by the gallon, is the realization of a dream.</TE>
<TE>   "I swore I was going to be a drag racer one day," he said,
recalling the times he would roar to the local track in his
hot-rodded 1966 Volkswagen to watch the powerful drag cars rocket
down the quarter-mile strip.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he sees nothing incongruous about spending the money he
earns enforcing traffic laws and speed limits to build a race truck
whose only purpose is speed.</TE>
<TE>   Properly designed and built, a race car is loaded with safety
devices, and properly used it is never raced on public streets, where
laws apply and others could be endangered.</TE>
<TE>   That's the message Smith tries to spread when he shows up at
compact performance car shows and events with his truck, the CHP logo
emblazoned on its doors, to talk about the benefits of organized drag
racing versus illegal street racing.</TE>
<TE>   Being a cop, he says, doesn't make him any less a car enthusiast.</TE>
<TE>   Rotondo agrees. Creating the replica of the "rent-a-racer" Shelby
GT that select Hertz car rental agencies carried infected him with a
bug that led him to turn one of the last CHP Harley-Davidson patrol
motorcycles into a custom chopper. He's now involved with two
Mustang-restoring buddies in a project to create an exact replica of
a 1966 Shelby GT Mustang.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's truck and Rotondo's "Hertz Shelby" will be among the
scores of show cars, hot rods, muscle cars, motorcycles and custom
vehicles owned by CHP personnel and on display at the Petersen museum
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The display also features a variety of CHP vehicles from
television shows and movies and a selection of departmental vehicles.
These include a 1955 Buick patrol car and one of the new low-profile
2002 Camaros the patrol is using in an effort to catch speeding
truckers--and SUV and other passenger vehicle drivers--who often can
evade citations by spotting regular-sized patrol vehicles from their
elevated positions.</TE>
<TE>   Admission is $10 and includes all of the museum's exhibits.
Proceeds from the day will go to the CHP 11-99 Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The Petersen is at 6060 Wilshire Blvd. at Fairfax Avenue in Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>GM Rolls Out Fresher, Hulkier Versions of 3 of Its
Biggest-Selling Big Trucks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>In a relentless effort to keep its lineup of pickup trucks and sport
utility vehicles fresh without carrying out a complete redesign,
General Motors recently unveiled new versions of three of its popular
truck models, including an SUV with a sliding roof and the biggest
Cadillac truck ever.</LD>
<LD>   The 2004 GMC Envoy XUV is a version of the hulking Envoy XL (think
Chevy Suburban twin) with a sliding roof over a cargo bed that is
sealed off from the rest of the truck's interior by GM's fold-down
"midgate"--meaning the cargo area can be hosed out without getting
the rest of the truck's insides wet.</LD>
<LD>   With the top open, drivers can carry around, say, potted palm
trees, a function admittedly more in demand in L.A. than in the
Midwest. The midgate now has a power window, and the rear gate also
folds down or swings open.</LD>
<TE>   "There are about 50 SUVs out there, and people want
reconfigurability," said Mike Abelson, GM's chief engineer for
mid-size trucks.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadillac Escalade ESV is the luxury sibling of the Suburban,
with three rows of seats and 180% more cargo room than the standard
Escalade. GM calls the ESV, which will be available in the first
quarter of 2003 and which can be configured for eight passengers, the
biggest luxury SUV on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   The Escalade ESV, however, won't have GM's Quadrasteer four-wheel
steering, which greatly reduces trucks' turning radius, as an option,
said Escalade marketing manager Susan Docherty. It's at least a
$4,500 option, and luxury truck buyers are more likely to want to use
that money for big, brash wheels or multiscreen entertainment units,
Docherty said.</TE>
<TE>   High performance also is coming to GM's Chevy Silverado full-size
pickup, the second-best-selling vehicle in the U.S. market (after
Ford's F-series pickup). The Silverado SS gets GM's 345-horsepower
V-8 engine and four-speed automatic overdrive transmission.</TE>
<TE>   All GM full-size trucks are getting some 40 new technology
features for the 2003 model year, including dual-stage air bags;
dual-zone climate controls; heated and power-folding exterior mirrors
and upgraded audio systems.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a passenger-side air bag suppression system made up
of a sensor sewn into the passenger seat that deactivates the
passenger air bag if the seat is occupied by a child seat or a small
adult.</TE>
<TE>   The all-truck GMC division also released a sketch of the Canyon,
an all-new mid-size pickup truck that will replace the compact GMC
Sonoma. No details were released other than that the Canyon will be
built in Shreveport, La., starting in the fourth quarter of 2003. But
by calling it a mid-size pickup, GM hinted it will be a step up in
size from the compact Sonoma.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: When I'm driving my Audi A4 and have the radio on, I'm
troubled by the fact that not only do I have to listen to
advertisements, but I also see them scrolling across display monitors
in my car.</LD>
<LD>   The vehicle's Radio Data System displays printed messages and text
that identifies the radio station and the names of songs and
recording artists. There's a monitor on the stereo faceplate and one
located between the odometer and tachometer on the dashboard.</LD>
<LD>   If I had the option, I'd get rid of this standard feature in a
heartbeat. It's distracting. I'm a good driver, but I'm embarrassed
to admit that on occasion I've spent so much time trying to decipher
the messages that I've taken my eyes off the road.</LD>
<TE>   --C.M., Rancho Cucamonga</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Scrolling messages and ads from the Radio Data System
certainly could lead to distraction if you're more focused on the
monitors than on the road. You can avoid the visual annoyance by
switching off the message and text feature on the car radio system.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the concerns you raised make me wonder how many drivers are
out there cruising around with eyes glued to RDS monitors. The
systems are becoming increasingly popular, especially in high-end
vehicles. Cadillac, for example, also offers RDS as standard
equipment in some models.</TE>
<TE>   The risk of driver distraction by an RDS feature is similar to the
danger posed by improper use of other electronic gadgets and gizmos.
The use of cell phones, Internet service and entertainment centers
can impair a driver's concentration, safety advocates warn.</TE>
<TE>   Features such as DVD players and video games can be especially
distracting if the screens are mounted so they can be viewed by
drivers. Even navigation systems that require drivers to study maps
on a monitor can dangerously divert their attention.</TE>
<TE>   There is no federal legislation restricting the use of such
systems in vehicles, said Liz Neblitt, a spokeswoman for the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The agency does, however, warn drivers not to engage in behavior
that could distract them behind the wheel. In fact, research by the
agency and groups including AAA has shown that 25% to 50% of the 6.5
million crashes reported in the U.S. each year involve some form of
distraction or inattention.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of federal legislation has prompted some states to come
up with restrictions of their own to ensure safety.</TE>
<TE>   In California, video or television screens, by law, cannot be
installed in the front-seat portion of a vehicle within view of the
driver, said Anne Da Vigo, a spokeswoman for the California Highway
Patrol in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Californians are able to drive vehicles equipped
with flip-down screens viewable by front-seat passengers. Aftermarket
players and monitors also are allowed as long as they are not visible
to the driver.</TE>
<TE>   With the growing popularity of all this technology, said auto
safety advocate Rosemary Shahan, the traffic safety administration
needs to step in and "exert some authority in this arena."</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally irresponsible for auto manufacturers to design in
ads that compete for your eyeballs while you're busy navigating in
heavy traffic," said Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto
Reliability and Safety in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "Driver distraction is a serious problem that contributes to many
crashes," she said. "Manufacturers have shown they don't know where
to draw the line."</TE>
<TE>   But industry sources say that auto makers are taking the issue of
driver distraction seriously and that many manufacturers have
launched studies to make the technology safer.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., for instance, announced this year that it
would spend $10 million over three years to determine the safest way
to equip vehicles with communication devices, said Jim Spoonhower,
vice president for market research at the Specialty Equipment Market
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. has spent millions of dollars to address the
distraction factor, said Spoonhower, whose Diamond Bar-based trade
group represents the $26-billion-a-year auto aftermarket industry.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of such research, auto makers are trying to make
vehicles safer by pushing voice activation and hands-free technology
in vehicles, Spoonhower said.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, he predicts, video-based devices will be designed
to be inoperable in the front seat when a vehicle is in motion. It
will happen whether it's legislated or manufacturers agree "to do it
for safety sake."</TE>
<TE>   "The idea," he said, "is the driver can't be distracted."</TE>
<TE>   Clarion, a major maker of mobile multimedia equipment, markets a
system called Joyride that incorporates a DVD-CD-MP3 player and a
navigation system.</TE>
<TE>   By applying voice activation and touch-screen command features on
such products, the company is responding to drivers' desire for safer
ways to use the high-tech systems in their vehicles, said Melissa
Low, a company spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Auto entertainment and navigation systems have great appeal to
many families who have children and want products that are "cool but
also safe," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the market for mobile video-navigation equipment was
estimated at $700 million. That was up from $500 million in 2000, the
Specialty Equipment Market Assn. said.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line seems to be that many people who can afford this
technology crave it. But we need to remember that the more gadgets we
accumulate in our vehicles, the higher the risk of distraction.</TE>

<LD>Seeking the Edge of the Solar System</LD>
<LD>   How big is our solar system? If you answered that it ends with
Pluto's orbit (an average of 5,913,520,000 kilometers or
3,647,200,000 miles from the sun), you're in for a surprise! The
power of our sun actually extends at least twice that far. Our solar
system is more than just the space between the planets. The solar
wind from our sun forms a sort of bubble that surrounds the nine
planets and goes beyond them. Scientists call the volume inside the
bubble the heliosphere. They measure the size of our solar system as
the distance to the edge of the bubble.</LD>
<LD>   "Helios" means "sun." The heliopause is the outer edge of the
heliosphere. You can remember these two similar words by thinking
about the bubble as a ball or sphere (heliosphere). The outer
boundary is where the solar wind stops (heliopause). Scientists
believe the heliopause is 20 to 22 billion kilometers (12 billion to
14 billion miles) from the sun. That is the edge of interstellar
space (where the other stars are).</LD>
<TE>   The two Voyager spacecraft, launched way back in 1977, will
probably be the first human-made objects to approach the heliopause.
Before they cross into interstellar space, though, the two craft will
pass through an area called the "termination shock." At that point,
the solar wind should drop from more than 1,500,000 kilometers
(nearly 1,000,000 miles) per hour to a very breezy 400,000 kilometers
(250,000 miles) per hour. That's still fast enough to blow your
homework into the next galaxy! (Well, not really. The next galaxy is
very, very far away.) Once Voyagers 1 and 2 fly through the
termination shock, they still probably won't cross the heliopause for
another 10 to 15 years. So you may read about it with your kids.</TE>
<TE>   The two Voyager spacecraft will provide scientists with lots of
information about the very outer edges of our solar system. To learn
about the Voyager spacecraft, visit Space Place at
spaceplace.nasa.gov/vgr_fact3.htm.</TE>

Stone, Voyager Project scientist. It was provided by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a

<LD>"Revolutionary War on Wednesday"</LD>
<LD>   by Mary Pope Osborne</LD>
<LD>   This is a story about two kids, Jack and Annie, who find a
treehouse filled with books. They soon discover the treehouse is
magic and the books can take them to any place in time. All they have
to do is point to a picture and wish they were there.</LD>
<TE>   They choose to go back in time to meet Gen. George Washington as
he was about to lead his army in a sneak attack against the enemy. As
they cross the Delaware River in a small boat, they run into a
snowstorm. Gen. Washington has his doubts about going on. The kids
encourage him to go on and tell him he needs to continue and that he
will win the war.</TE>
<TE>   After Jack and Annie keep history on track, they return home and
are excited about their next adventure.</TE>
<TE>   The author's style of writing is imaginative. She gives her
readers a sense of what it would be like to join one of our greatest
American leaders, Washington, in the Revolutionary War. She makes
learning about history interesting and exciting.</TE>

<LD>These condiment side dishes quickly and creatively dress up casual
meals. They're great with cold cuts and grilled meat, poultry and
fish. The serving is easy--just spoon them right onto your dinner
plate.</LD>
<LD>   The dishes draw on the seasonal market and produce bin, and that's
what makes them so inviting. Be sure to choose ingredients of top
quality. Explore your farmers market or produce aisle for the best of
the season.</LD>
<LD>   Take any of these to a summer potluck. The mushroom condiment dish
is especially suited to grilled steaks and hamburgers. The carrot and
beet slaw is a salad that I made long ago with James Beard; it's
crunchy, refreshing and tasty. No cooking required, as beets are
delicious raw. And for the vegetable relish, an array of cut-up
vegetables--cucumber, tomatoes and radishes, tossed with a piquant
dressing and fresh basil--can hold its own beside any summer salad.</LD>

know that fresh albacore, the locally caught kind, is also one of our
most seasonal specialties, available only for a couple of months
during the summer, depending on the vagaries of weather and ocean
currents.</LD>
<LD>   For those in the know, the good news is the albacore are running.
Russell Mizuno of Los Angeles Fish Co. says he got his first shipment
three weeks ago. So far, supply has been spotty, but he's hoping it
picks up this week.</LD>
<LD>   "They've been staying too far off the coast to get very many," he
says. Albacore spoils quickly because of its high fat content, so
fresh fish have to be taken within a day's sail of the coast. Fish
that are caught further out must be frozen.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Cimarusti, the chef at Water Grill in Los Angeles, says
good-quality, locally caught albacore "has a very pleasant flavor
when it's impeccably fresh. And the color, when it's sliced really
thin, is beautifully translucent."</TE>
<TE>   These local albacore are smaller than the ones from farther out,
with fish averaging 20 pounds rather than 40 to 50. The filets from
these are small as well. If you're seeing albacore steaks, they're
probably from the bigger fish.</TE>
<TE>   Freshly caught albacore are summer favorites at sushi bars, where
they're served as sashimi or sushi (shiro maguro) or served
tataki-style, lightly seared on both sides. Locally caught albacore
are usually offered only as specials or on an omakase menu the chef
selects. If albacore is part of a set menu, it may be from frozen
fish.</TE>
<TE>   Local albacore is less common in American restaurants, though it
does show up occasionally, simply grilled or in Japanese-style
dishes.</TE>
<TE>   Mizuno says the thing to look for when buying fresh albacore is
color. It should be milky, not clear. In fact, its Japanese name can
be translated as "white tuna." "The quality of albacore depends on
how much fat it contains," he says. "If it's a little too lean, it
looks almost like Jell-O. If it has enough fat, it looks like a pale
white color, almost milky looking."</TE>
<TE>   Because it is so fleeting and so scarce, locally caught albacore
is hard to find at retail. Check Los Angeles Fish Co. downtown, at
420 Stanford Ave., between 3rd and 4th streets. It supplies many
sushi chefs and it will sell to retail customers, though service and
choice will be limited. It's best to get there before 11 a.m., and
don't count on finding fish fileted, skinned and sold in pre-weighed
portions.</TE>
<TE>   Its texture is the best thing about fresh albacore, says Shunji
Nakao, chef at the Hump in Santa Monica. "It's very tender is what it
is," he says. Cimarusti doesn't use the fish all that often, though
he did offer albacore sashimi as a special just last week. "I walked
in the market and there was this perfect 20-pound fish so fresh you
couldn't even open the gills. A fish that fresh, you've got to buy
it."</TE>

<HD>Virtue With a Touch of Gloss</HD>
<DH>Eating Well returns to fight the good fight</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eating Well is back. For those of us unaware that it had gone
anywhere, or what it was in the first place, Eating Well is a
magazine. Launched in 1990, its target readers were what the
publishers estimated were 77 million aging baby boomers with the
means to give dinner parties, but suddenly conscious enough of their
mortality to worry that a rich souffle might be their last.</LD>
<LD>   Eating Well would take the fashionable dishes of the day and put
them through a nutritionist's sieve. There would be stories about the
food industry and feverish food politics of the day. It would be the
thinking hypertensive's alternative to the glossy Cooking Light.</LD>
<LD>   Turning counterculture instincts to a diet magazine for the
ascetic intelligentsia was the idea of James Lawrence, a journalism
major out of Cornell and Syracuse universities and a former Peace
Corps volunteer. By the late 1980s, Lawrence was a Vermont-based
publisher of several lifestyle periodicals. Eating Well was developed
just as the Canadian publishing group Telemedia purchased 85% of
Lawrence's company. In July 1990, Lawrence rolled out a premier issue
packed with the kind of upscale ads usually attainable only by
established publishers.</LD>
<TE>   There were high hopes for the new food magazine's market mix. The
original editor, Barry Estabrook, promised the New York Times that he
would "treat food as serious journalism."</TE>
<TE>   The "charter issue" certainly had attitude. The typeface was a
stylish spin on Rolling Stone Roman. There was interesting white
space along with Magritte-style illustrations and a formidable
procession of writing and cooking talent, including chef Rick
Bayless, authors Martha Rose Shulman and Darra Goldstein.</TE>
<TE>   There was a visit to Robert Mondavi's kitchen and a cracking piece
of reporting traced a rockfish caught in the Pacific then sold as a
red snapper in Des Moines eight days later.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine was decreed groundbreaking and sophisticated by the
national press.</TE>
<TE>   As the months rolled on, the prominent names kept coming. Corby
Kummer celebrated Alice Waters and authentic French cookery.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine aimed at money. There were glossy ads for dream
kitchens. But look closely, and the theme was using those deluxe
rooms to drain the fat out of food. Yogurt was never simply yogurt,
but always low-fat or non-fat versions.</TE>
<TE>   By November, the magazine was carrying recipes for eggless
mayonnaise, reinventing trifle with skim milk and cornstarch, and
promoting a dehydrated egg substitute called "EggZact."</TE>
<TE>   But these were strange times, and the formula was working.
Vanquishing calories was a politically correct activity, good
housekeeping was suddenly a cause. Washington lobbyists were sending
out press releases concerning proper hand-washing and chopping-board
maintenance instructions.</TE>
<TE>   However, as successful as his magazine was, trouble arrived for
the founder within six months. "There was a shake-up at the top of
Telemedia," says Lawrence. "I was soon invited to leave."</TE>
<TE>   But the staff stayed and the magazine carried on much as he had
envisioned it for the next five years, he says. Circulation peaked at
more than 600,000. Calculating how many copies got passed along,
total readership was estimated at 3 million.</TE>
<TE>   But this was still far from Cooking Light's 9.2 million. In 1997,
a merger put the New York publishing group Hachette-Filipacchi in
charge of Eating Well.</TE>
<TE>   By April 1998, the old Rolling Stone Roman, interesting white
space and big-name authors were gone. The magazine was no longer an
alternative to Cooking Light, but a thin imitation. A cover done out
in lime green and pink shrieked, "Lighten up!"</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the lighteners were in overdrive--readers were offered
smoked turkey breasts for Easter brunch. A souffle, described as a
"puff," called for nine eggs, but threw away seven of the yolks.
There were "creamless" cream soups. Caesar salad dressing was
approximated with low-fat cottage cheese and nonfat plain yogurt.</TE>
<TE>   The new managers wanted young readers, says food editor Patsy
Jamieson. This was not a logical audience for a magazine dedicated to
careful eating, she contends: "Young people still eat out a lot; they
still think they're invincible, still bulletproof."</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, Eating Well's ad sales were down, the readers ages were
up and Hachette-Filipacchi folded the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   But it was not quite dead. Early in 2001, Lawrence found the
rights to Eating Well on the market as part of an Internet
kitchenware company. He bought them and gathered a handful of the
original staff--including Jamieson--to resurrect the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Over</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, it would not be bimonthly but quarterly. There
would be no large corporate partners, no ad agencies, no advertisers
offering dream kitchens. A skeleton staff worked six months for free.
At launch, the old staff of 60 was down to more like 15 people, and
the magazine that reportedly cost $12 million to develop in 1990 has
been resuscitated for $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   They are motivated, says Lawrence, by belief in their magazine and
a bulletin board festooned with supportive e-mails from former
subscribers. Messages include, "Why not charge as much as Saveur
magazine charges? At least I can find the ingredients used in Eating
Well!"</TE>
<TE>   The new issue, labeled Vol. One, Number 1, is now arriving in
stores--not to newsstands, not the kind with cigars, says Lawrence,
and not airports, but in bookstores and health-food shops.</TE>
<TE>   The old design flair is back, but in updated, elegant versions.
There are features on portion sizes, about chili peppers, eating in
Greece, veggie burgers and summer sorbets.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Madison is among the contributors and organic activist and
Columbia University nutritionist Joan Gussow is on the advisory
board.</TE>
<TE>   The intent, says Lawrence in the editor's introduction, is "to
publish a magazine with authority, integrity and--at the right
moments--an editorial funny bone."</TE>
<TE>   In the new Vol. One, a column called the "Healthy Skeptic" is the
funny part, explains Jamieson. In this issue, the skeptic caricatures
people who consume raw oysters or lick a cookie bowl as "XTreme"
eaters.</TE>
<TE>   If this doesn't tickle everyone's funny bone, there is merry
eloquence to be found. A lovely feature, "My Greek Island Table," by
Greek American food-writer Diane Kochilas, could have shone in the
lush "charter issue" 12 years ago. In it, Kochilas describes life in
Christos, a village on the island of Ikaria, where shops open when
it's cool. "You can buy shoes and sugar at midnight, but not at 9 in
the morning," she writes. The food comes straight from the land and
tradition. It is consumed with great festivity. Kochilas provides
recipes for butterflied leg of lamb, potato salad and filo pastries.
Olive oil is measured by the cup, not the tablespoon. It is the best
kind of food writing. It brings your own family to mind, then drives
you to the phone to invite them over, then the kitchen to cook for
them.</TE>
<TE>   But elsewhere, the magazine is older, its lips are thinner and it
is not amused. Getting to this evocative piece about a place where
time stood still requires reading a number of articles about a place
where tradition seems to consist of tumult: modern America.</TE>
<TE>   It is like a voyage through a war zone, then a crime scene, then a
hospital ward which concludes--somewhat disarmingly--in a high-class
fat farm. Headlines in a health-minded section announce ways of
"beating hypertension" with dairy products, "tracing dental decay to
acidic beverages" and using vegetables as "nature's aspirin."</TE>
<TE>   The foremost issue is fat. The magazine lives on the front line of
the argument over how 60% of Americans got to be fat, 30% obese, and
how to slim us all down again. The central interview with
nutritionist and author of "Food Politics" Marion Nestle, laments
that Uncle Sam is "no longer the lean, straight-talking icon of our
memories" but someone who remains silent on the efforts of the food
industry to overstuff us.</TE>
<TE>   There is a chart showing the typical serving size of fries rose
from the 1950 standard of 2 ounces to the present one of 6. While
Uncle Sam didn't set the size of McDonalds' French fry packets, the
interviewer and Nestle argue that he failed to issue categorical
public warnings not to eat fries, at least very often.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, Eating Well is a straight-up cookery magazine, a
provider of elegant dinner party recipes. As in the old days,
nutritionists have taken largely classic recipes and conducted what
they regard as healthful little switcheroos, usually reducing fat. So
in a cherry crumble, most of the butter for the crust is replaced
with canola oil and orange juice concentrate. The ice-cream topping
is low-fat or, preferably, low- or no-fat frozen yogurt. There is an
entire article dedicated to grilling skinless chicken breasts.</TE>
<TE>   Not as Fearful of Fat</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence insists that this is joyous, delicious food. Food that
"intelligent" people eat. Moreover, it has gotten richer, says
Jamieson. Their fear of fat has lessened as science has back-pedaled
from much of the early condemnations of eggs and unsaturated fats.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we did some silly things over the years," says Jamieson,
"or not silly, but with the knowledge we have now, we would do things
differently." Once they threw away egg yolks, she says. No more.</TE>
<TE>   If Eating Well has fought for its survival, Cooking Light--owned
by the media giant Time Warner--has gone from strength to strength.
Its Los Angeles advertising office says readership has climbed from
9.2 million to just more than 10 million, almost twice that of
Gourmet's. It, too, nips the fat out of food (there's cooking spray
greasing the pan for the glazed ham). But, compare the current
editions of the two magazines and one finds that where Eating Well is
weighing the health benefits of food diet supplements derived from
chili peppers, Cooking Light is urging us to exercise our inner child
by rediscovering the hula-hoop.</TE>
<TE>   They imagine themselves as attracting different readers. Eating
Well wants NPR listeners. Cooking Light is going for "Oprah"
watchers. But whoever they think we are, or what we want, neither
magazine seems to trust us with real food, with the wit to eat whole
yogurt, real milk or cream when we want something filling, and an
apple when we want a light snack.</TE>
<TE>   They prefer to teach moderation by denying us content in the first
place. Whether this works, or just leaves us ravenous and rushing off
to McDonald's for some of those super-sized servings of fries, is
anyone's guess. Certainly abroad, good food is richer and the
population is thinner.</TE>

<HD>The Artful Salad</HD>
<DH>It's still a classic, but has no airs. With the right
approach, it simply falls into place.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Composed salad. The very name is enough to kill your appetite.
Visions of white-gloved matrons sitting around after bridge eating
sliced canned peaches artfully arranged over slivered iceberg lettuce
and decorated with cream cheese rosettes.</LD>
<LD>   In the minds of most people, composed salads are antiques from the
old-fashioned school of cooking that valued form over function, that
was concerned more with the way dishes looked than how they tasted.</LD>
<LD>   After all, why arrange all of those ingredients so carefully if
you're just going to toss them together at the table? Along with
fluted mushrooms and chaud-froid, composed salads are almost too easy
to ridicule.</LD>
<TE>   But let's not be too hasty to poke fun. There's nothing wrong with
composed salads that updating won't cure. Like much of classical
cuisine, when stripped to their barest components, there is good,
sensible food behind the stilted prettiness.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, with good cooks, the decoration has never been the dish's
main virtue. In that bible of old-fashioned French cooking, the
"Larousse Gastronomique," the name salades composees is translated
"combination salads" as opposed to "simple salads," emphasizing the
mix of raw and cooked ingredients rather than their artistic
arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Escoffier went one step further, speaking out forcefully against
the over-decoration of the dish. "The increased appetizing look
resulting therefrom is small compared with the loss in the taste of
the preparation," he wrote in "The Escoffier Cook Book." "The
simplest form of serving is the best, and fancifulness should not be
indulged in."</TE>
<TE>   So forget about separating the meat, vegetables and greens into
little decorative piles. Arrange them in a more modern, naturalistic
way, and you've got something delicious that is beautiful without
being contrived.</TE>
<TE>   Even better, what you've got is dinner. Because when you get right
down to it, a composed salad is the perfect meal for these hot summer
nights.</TE>
<TE>   Take a small portion of fish, meat or cheese and arrange it on a
colorful bed of vegetables, greens and herbs. Bind the whole thing
together with a bold dressing of some sort. What could be better?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, you're probably already making composed salads right now
without even thinking about it. Ever slice ripe tomatoes and dripping
fresh mozzarella, decorate it with dark green fresh basil, and then
serve it with good olive oil and a loaf of crusty bread? Is there a
better--or prettier--dinner on a sweltering weeknight?</TE>
<TE>   That's a very basic example. How about tossing together canned
white beans and tuna? A little olive oil and lemon juice, some sharp
bites of chopped red onion ... or what about thinly sliced steak and
room-temperature steamed potatoes, bound with a mustardy vinaigrette.</TE>
<TE>   You see where we're going with this.</TE>
<TE>   The definition of a composed salad has changed. Where once
composition may have referred to how the salad was arranged
(preferably in as static and staid a way as possible), now it has
more to do with flavor and the interplay of taste and texture.</TE>
<TE>   While presentation is still important, the fashion today is for
salads that look like food, rather than a painstakingly arranged
still-life.</TE>
<TE>   In the Edgewater book, a veritable Vogue magazine of arcane salad
fashions, there is something called a Lady Windermere: romaine,
cucumbers, cream cheese, and red and green peppers all arranged to
look like a fan.</TE>
<TE>   Today, we're more likely to be impressed by the way the pale pink
of a piece of shrimp stands out against the vivid green of fresh
herbs, or the way crisp red coins of radishes balance creamy, dark
orange egg yolks and thin slices of char-grilled steak.</TE>
<TE>   What may be even more impressive is the way these salads adapt to
what you already have in the pantry and refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   Canned white or garbanzo beans, tuna and smoked salmon; leftover
grilled chicken or steak and the vegetables from a big Sunday dinner.
All you need is some sturdy greens, a good dressing and a few
condiments and you're in business.</TE>
<TE>   Since these salads are served at room temperature, it's best to
use meat that is fairly lean. So remove the skin from the chicken. If
you're using beef, flank steak is always a good choice. Lately, with
more and more groceries stocking meat cut for customers from Mexico,
you can also find very thinly sliced sheets of skirt steak--the kind
that's usually used for carne asada.</TE>
<TE>   Through the summer, try to keep at least one head of watercress,
frisee, radicchio or curly endive in the crisper. These greens have
the strength--both in structure and flavor--to match up to almost
anything you can throw in the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Make sure the meat and all the vegetables are cut into bite-size
pieces, preferably of a similar size. These salads are about balanced
combinations of flavors: Don't let any one ingredient dominate.</TE>
<TE>   The dressing is the unifying factor for composed salads. For
lighter combinations, such as tuna and garbanzo beans, a simple
mixture of olive oil and lemon juice is all that's needed to point up
the flavors.</TE>
<TE>   As the ingredients get heavier and bolder, so should the dressing.
Adding a little Dijon mustard and some minced shallots to that
vinaigrette will make a nice accompaniment to a salad made with
grilled beef.</TE>
<TE>   You can even go so far as an old-fashioned sauce gribiche--a kind
of tart mustard-vinaigrette flavored with minced herbs, cornichons
and capers and given a chunky, slightly thickened texture from finely
chopped hard-boiled egg yolks and whites.</TE>
<TE>   Flavored mayonnaises are always good. Start with either homemade
or a good commercial brand (Best Foods, sold as Hellmann's on the
East Coast, is the perennial first choice). Then add minced herbs,
pureed roasted peppers or whatever else strikes your fancy. Even the
best of the prepared mayonnaises will benefit from the addition of a
little acidity: lemon juice or a vinegar of some sort.</TE>
<TE>   Whichever dressing you choose, use just enough to season the salad
and give it cohesiveness, but don't overdo it. When you taste the
salad, the main flavor should be the ingredients, not the dressing.
And a good salad should never be gloppy.</TE>
<TE>   A good rule of thumb is to add half the dressing and toss well,
then add the rest a tablespoon at a time. Remember you can always
pass more dressing at the table.</TE>
<TE>   Also remember that if you're using starchy ingredients--beans,
rice or potatoes, for example--they'll absorb the flavors better if
you mix them with a little bit of dressing while they're still hot.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the occasion, these salads can be served either on
individual plates or mounded in a platter. Some decoration is
necessary, but keep it natural. Save out half of the most colorful
ingredients so you can scatter them over the salad a little more
artfully.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, you wouldn't want to trust the way your dinner looks to
the random effects of gravity. But neither should you labor over the
appearance. After all, it's a meal, not a mosaic.</TE>

<HD>Perfect Hard-Boiled Eggs: As Easy as Boiling Water</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'll find hard-boiled eggs in many composed salads. There are few
ingredients that are simpler, but there are few that bedevil cooks
more. Theories about how to cook them abound, but, like the eggs
themselves, the answer is deceptively simple.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the most common problem with hard-boiled eggs is
overcooking. That's what happens when the yolks are pale yellow with
that familiar green band around the outside. There is frequently the
odor of sulfur. This is due to a reaction between traces of iron in
the yolk and sulfur in the white. It happens only when the eggs have
been overcooked. Perfectly cooked yolks are moist and deep orange.
Needless to say, there is no chemical smell.</LD>
<LD>   The second-biggest problem is cracked shells that leak yolk and
white out into the cooking water. This is caused by too-rapid
heating. All eggs contain an air pocket at the base (the wide, rather
than the pointed, end). When this air pocket is heated, it expands.
If it is heated too quickly, it more like explodes, cracking the
shell.</LD>
<TE>   How do you avoid these problems? There's one very simple method.
Place the eggs in a pan just big enough to hold them in a single
layer. Cover them with cold water and bring them to a rolling boil.
Cook for one minute, then remove them from the heat. When the water
has cooled enough that you can put your hand in (about 20 minutes),
the eggs will be perfectly cooked.</TE>
<TE>   How does this work? It's actually a neat bit of science. The eggs
don't overcook because you're taking advantage of a heating curve.
Rather than holding them at 212 degrees (the temperature of boiling
water), you start them toward that temperature and then, before the
interior reaches it, you remove them from the heat. The inside
doesn't get hotter than the perfect temperature of 160 degrees before
the water cools enough to stop the cooking.</TE>
<TE>   The cracking problem is avoided by heating the egg gradually by
starting it in cold water. Though egg shells are remarkably fragile,
they are also porous. When the air pocket is heated gradually, it
expands slowly enough that the air can escape through the microscopic
holes in the shell (look closely: you'll see a trail of tiny bubbles
coming from the base).</TE>
<TE>   Another problem people have with hard-boiled eggs is peeling them.
Again, the solution is simple: Use older eggs, such as those stored
as little as a week in your refrigerator. Two things happen while an
egg sits around. First, it becomes more alkaline, which results in an
increase in the thin part of the egg white. Also, the air pocket gets
bigger as air is absorbed through the porous shell. The combination
of these things makes the egg shell easier to remove.</TE>
<TE>   Some cooks claim that chilling a hard-boiled egg in an ice-water
bath makes it easier to peel. But when we tested that theory with two
identical eggs cooked exactly the same way, the one from the
ice-water bath was actually harder to peel. Some things just can't be
fixed.</TE>

<HD>Who Needs Pie Crust?</HD>

<AU>DONNA DEANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing like a piece of fresh fruit pie, especially when it's
topped with a brown-sugar streusel. This is a lighter version, which
is especially appealing in the heat of summer, because it has no
crust. It's all about the fruit, peaches and raspberries, which are
topped with streusel, then baked in a cast-iron skillet until brown
and bubbly.</LD>
<LD>   Not having a crust, of course, also lowers the calories in each
serving.</LD>
<LD>   It's important to begin with good, ripe peaches. They should have
a cream or yellow background, be soft to the touch and fragrant.</LD>
<TE>   If they're not quite ripe, place the peaches in a paper bag and
let them stand at room temperature for a day or two until they
soften.</TE>
<TE>   To peel peaches, place them in a saucepan of boiling water, a few
at a time, for one to two minutes. Use a knife to cut into one; if
the skin peels easily, plunge the peaches into ice water to stop the
cooking, then peel and slice. Toss them quickly with the other
ingredients or they'll turn brown.</TE>
<TE>   Serve this right from the oven to the table.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't have a cast-iron skillet, use a shallow 10-inch
baking dish.</TE>
<TE>   Peach and Raspberry Streusel</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons cold butter, plus more for preparing skillet</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom</TE>
<TE>   5 cups peeled, sliced peaches (about 5 peaches)</TE>
<TE>   1 cup raspberries</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons corn syrup</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon almond extract</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Lightly butter a seasoned 10-inch
cast-iron skillet.</TE>
<TE>   Blend together the flour, brown sugar, cardamom and butter in a
bowl using a pastry blender or your fingers until blended and
crumbly. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the peaches, raspberries, granulated sugar, corn syrup,
cornstarch, almond extract and salt in a bowl. Pour into the skillet.
Sprinkle the streusel topping evenly over the top.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until browned and bubbly and the peaches are tender, 25 to 30
minutes. Serve warm.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--One of the best things about this sweltering city in the
summertime is its legendary Greenmarket in Union Square.</LD>
<LD>   The market is an urban oasis of greenery, flowers and exquisite
produce, a social center for the food community and, of course, the
best source for local fruit and vegetables, often grown to meet the
demands of top chefs.</LD>
<LD>   The Greenmarket is also an easy way for the tourist to dip into
the life of the city--an experience that is far more real than, say,
a trip to Times Square and sometimes, more entertaining.</LD>
<TE>   The Greenmarket, the first and largest of New York City's farmers
markets, bustles with chefs, food writers and produce obsessives, who
trade gossip while hunting for unusual heirloom tomatoes or sniffing
fragrant Charentais melons. The scene is at its best early mornings,
especially on Wednesday and Saturday, when the market is at its
largest.</TE>
<TE>   David Bouley may roar up on his motorcycle to pick up a flat of
delicate wild strawberries, while office workers, students and
tourists throng the 50-odd stands next to the park at Union Square,
just north of Greenwich Village, in a thriving area that the market
itself helped make popular.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of a year, the big California markets may offer a
greater diversity of produce, but the midsummer Greenmarket features
a number of intriguing items rarely available back home.</TE>
<TE>   Last Friday, for example, there were maroon gooseberries with an
intensely sweet-tart flavor, splendid black raspberries and bright
red Montmorency tart cherries, the traditional kind for making pies
and jams.</TE>
<TE>   Franca Tantillo of Berried Treasures brought her first picking of
wild blueberries, tiny, fragile fruits laboriously gathered from a
meadow in the Catskill Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Most were from 6-foot-tall high-bush plants, the ancestors of
modern cultivated blueberries, and had a complex, tangy, wild taste,
irresistibly intense and purifying to the palate. They sold
quickly--no wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Tantillo also had wild low-bush blueberries, from plants less than
a foot tall. These fruits are lighter in color because their whitish
bloom doesn't rub off as easily. And they're sweeter but milder in
flavor. Because of the backbreaking labor involved in handpicking,
fresh low-bush blueberries are rare except in Maine and Canada, where
there are denser stands and a substantial commercial crop is
harvested with rakes for freezing and processing.</TE>
<TE>   But there's good news too--especially for those curious for a
taste but living on the opposite coast.</TE>
<TE>   For several weeks starting in early August, Sunrise County Wild
Blueberry Assn. in Cherryfield, Maine, will sell a 10-pound flat of
fresh wild low-bush blueberries for $21.10 plus shipping, which is
about $35 for second-day delivery. (For information, call (207)
497-2846; or e-mail wreathworks @nemaine.com.)</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Peter Hoffman, chef and owner of Savoy Restaurant in
SoHo, stopped by to sample Tantillo's celebrated Tristar
strawberries, a small, tender and flavorful variety, with much of the
exquisite aroma of wild strawberries. There's nothing like them for
making a shortcake, Hoffman said, because they render juice when cut,
whereas most modern berries have been selected for a firmer, drier
texture.</TE>
<TE>   In California the Tristar's closest relative is the Seascape,
which is offered by market stands such Harry's Berries.</TE>
<TE>   Across the way, there was Ted Blew's hot pepper stand. Blew grows
an astounding 300 varieties in New Jersey and will offer a
mind-boggling array by mid-August, from aromatic Peruvian Aji
Puca-Uchus to foot-long Hot Portugal Sizzlers.</TE>
<TE>   But even in July, his blazing display made the concrete canyons of
New York seem far away.</TE>
<TE>   Union Square Greenmarket, 17th Street and Broadway, New York City,
Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
(Tantillo sells on Friday only; Blew sells on Friday and Saturday).</TE>

<LD>Roasting tomatoes, especially with a little garlic and olive oil,
gives them a wonderful depth of flavor. But roasting takes
awhile--longer than you may want to wait for dinner.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a shortcut: Roast cherry tomatoes. They're ready in less
than half the time, and with the same delicious results. Try
combining them in a steak sandwich with crisp watercress dressed in a
mustardy vinaigrette.</LD>
<LD>   Serve these with flavored potato chips such as honey-mustard or
salt-and-malt-vinegar chips. And who's to argue with sweet, fresh
strawberries for dessert?</LD>
<TE>   Plates, bowls and napkins from Crate &amp; Barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Look for yellow and orange cherry tomatoes, in addition to the
usual red, for a more festive presentation.</TE>

<HD>A Grower Breaks Ground With a Winery Partnership</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy Beckstoffer's mission has been to boldly go where no
viticulturist has gone before. As one of the largest independent
grape growers in the Napa Valley, he has long been an innovator in
growing grapes, and in the business of growing grapes.</LD>
<LD>   But not in making wine.</LD>
<LD>   Napa Valley wineries purchase more than half the grapes they use
from independents like Beckstoffer. Yet the growers don't often
collect an equal share of the profits or the glory, especially when
their grapes are used to make high-priced wines such as the top Napa
Valley Cabernets.</LD>
<TE>   Now, Beckstoffer has broken new ground in grower-vintner
relations. He's entered an unprecedented long-term partnership with a
Napa Valley winery that gives him an equal share of the profits and
recognition on their $75 to $100 bottles.</TE>
<TE>   The new model effectively creates a virtual wine estate. Two, in
fact.</TE>
<TE>   Merryvale Vineyards, a winery that doesn't own vines, has obtained
exclusive long-term rights to the coveted fruit from two Beckstoffer
vineyards. A pair of vineyard-designated Napa Valley Cabernet
Sauvignons will be produced under a new label: Merryvale-Beckstoffer
Vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   One is made with grapes from Beckstoffer's Vineyard X in Oakville,
on the west side of the valley. It's a luscious, concentrated wine
with the elegance typical of Oakville Cabernet. It is scheduled for
September release at $75.</TE>
<TE>   The other, labeled Clone 6, is a rare single-clone bottling from
Beckstoffer's Georges III Vineyard on the eastern side of the
Rutherford AVA. Clone 6 is an old Cabernet selection that was brought
to California in the 19th century and then misplaced in an early UC
Davis experimental vineyard. It was rediscovered in the 1960s but not
propagated until the '80s. The scant five acres of Clone 6 in
Beckstoffer's vineyard has yielded a powerful, textured wine with
deep black fruit flavor. It will be released early next year at $100.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership has already released a third Merryvale-Beckstoffer
wine, a wonderfully intense '99 Merlot from Beckstoffer's Las Amigas
Vineyard in Carneros ($50), which combines Pomerol flavor with
California power. However, Merryvale does not have exclusive rights
to that fruit (Beherns &amp; Hitchcock and Provenance also bottle a Las
Amigas Merlot).</TE>
<TE>   I tasted all three wines along with their subsequent 2000 and '01
vintages. Each showed consistent character through the shading of
different growing seasons--the polished essences of Oakville,
Rutherford and Carneros.</TE>
<TE>   For three decades, Beckstoffer has been on the cutting edge of
precision grape growing to meet the specific needs of client
wineries. He's also been an innovator in the business of grape
growing, most notably as an early and vocal advocate for the rights
of growers. He currently sells grapes to more than 50 wine producers,
including Acacia, Clos du Val, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, Beherns &amp;
Hitchcock, Provenance and Paul Hobbs.</TE>
<TE>   With the new Merryvale-Beckstoffer Vineyards wines, Beckstoffer
has taken custom growing to a new level by effectively becoming a
full partner in a wine-making enterprise. With an output of 840 cases
total (eventually to top out at 2,000 to 3,000 cases), the two
Merryvale-Beckstoffer Cabernets are drops in the bucket in the
context of Merryvale's 120,000-case annual production and
Beckstoffer's 3,000-plus acres of vines in Napa, Lake and Mendocino
counties. Yet the highly unusual partnership makes them significant.</TE>
<TE>   "A normal vineyard relationship is with a guy who farms grapes to
a reasonable level of quality and sells them for the best price he
can," says Merryvale winemaker Steve Test. "Andy is much more
interested in where the grapes go, in the intricacies of pricing, and
in tailoring a particular set of rows in a particular block in a
particular vineyard in order for it to end up in the most prestigious
wine that he can find."</TE>
<TE>   The Old World model of prestige wines is based on the concept of
the vigneron--someone who grows grapes and turns them into wine. The
chateau in Bordeaux, the domaine in Burgundy, the estate in
Sancerre--all are situations in which the winemaker has direct
control of the vines, and the grapes are grown to be vinified in that
specific cellar so the wines express the nature of that property.
Traditionally, only ordinary table wines are made from purchased
fruit.</TE>
<TE>   A different paradigm has evolved in California. Here, the true
estate winery is still relatively uncommon, while some of the most
expensive wines are made by wineries that purchase grapes from
independent growers. The Merryvale-Beckstoffer partnership shows that
the New World model may yet merge with the European, with the
winery-grower relationship emulating the chateau or domaine.</TE>
<TE>   Beckstoffer was part of the modern revival of the Napa Valley wine
industry in the early 1970s. But while other new-wave vintners such
as Joseph Phelps and Warren Winiarski were building wineries, he
acquired vineyards. His current portfolio of 1,000-plus acres in Napa
Valley embraces some of the valley's best sites, including historic
properties originally planted by wine pioneers such as Georges de
Latour, Hamilton Crabb and George Belden Crane.</TE>
<TE>   He's never had any desire to own a winery, he says. "Why should I?
My skill set doesn't get into any sort of manufacturing process or
consumer marketing. I get a big rush out of owning land."</TE>
<TE>   When bottle prices for ultra-premium wines began to rise in the
1980s, Beckstoffer advocated a controversial notion of recognizing
the grower's contribution to a winery's success by tying the price of
grapes to the bottle price. He supports the general formula that a
ton of grapes should fetch roughly 100 times the bottle price. For
example, a winery charging $100 a bottle should be paying $10,000 a
ton for grapes.</TE>
<TE>   After an intricate equation that takes both partners' investments
into account, each realizes a gross profit of 50% to 60%. That seldom
happens, however, unless the grower has established some degree of
name recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Beckstoffer has that. His grapes are already important components
in many high-priced blends, including Merryvale's $90 Profile red
wine blend. Yet Beckstoffer believes that the proliferation of more
knowledgeable and appreciative consumers will make single-site wines
increasingly more prominent than blended wines. "We're not looking
for our grapes to be used in blending for someone's idea of
perfection," says Beckstoffer. "We want to show off the site. It
isn't about creating a Barbie doll by blending a lot of different
wines with complementary qualities. This is the real beauty who
happens to have a chipped tooth and is more beautiful because of it."</TE>
<TE>   Current thinking among wine industry analysts supports that view.
"There is a growing appreciation among consumers for where the grapes
come from, for appellation and terroir," notes consultant Karen
Coleman of the wine industry consulting firm Motto, Kryla &amp; Fisher.
"In that regard, there is an opportunity for growers to say that part
of the success of a wine is based on the quality of the grapes, and a
vineyard designation reinforces that."</TE>
<TE>   Beckstoffer has long wanted a stable long-term partnership with a
winery, he says. "I've been looking for partner wineries who express
the sense of place of individual properties rather than blending,"
says Beckstoffer, "and who would be willing to share in the profit by
tying the price of grapes to the bottle price."</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, Merryvale owner Jack Schlatter (who became a
partner in Merryvale in 1991 and sole owner in '96) had a dilemma: no
vineyard. "We could either buy great vineyards," he says, "or we
could develop relationships with great growers." Great Napa Valley
vineyards don't often come up for sale; when they do, the cost can be
upward of $150,000 an acre. Yet it can be difficult to maintain
consistent high quality buying grapes on the open market.</TE>
<TE>   That particularly concerns a winemaker like Test. He's known for
sumptuous red wines that are full-bodied and rich yet clear and
finely structured, and that standard requires superb fruit. "We are
absolutely mortally dependent on good growers, so when we find this
kind of opportunity we take it," says Test. "I don't have to go to a
meeting with a vineyard manager carrying a baseball bat to try to get
him to do things that improve quality. In this arrangement both
parties have an incentive to make the best wine possible."</TE>
<TE>   Beckstoffer has always been in the position of selling fruit to
multiple wineries. In fact, Merryvale has bottled Beckstoffer
Vineyards-designated wines since 1992. Yet that wasn't a true
partnership--the fruit wasn't grown specifically for Merryvale, nor
did Beckstoffer have a stake in the success of the wine.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly is unusual to have the vineyard being so prominently
featured on a label," Test says. "We're locked in a real embrace on
this, and we hope it will be a good thing for both of us for a long
time."</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>1995 Kalin Cellars Semillon, Livermore Valley, California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Semillon is the golden grape that's blended with Sauvignon Blanc to
make the steely dry Graves and luscious sweet Sauternes of Bordeaux.
It isn't much used in California, but Terry Leighton has been making
compelling Semillons for Kalin Cellars since 1977.</LD>
<LD>   His 1995 Semillon--that's right; Leighton waits awhile to release
his Semillon--is a prime example. The grapes come from a Livermore
Valley vineyard originally planted in the 1880s with cuttings brought
over from Chateau d'Yquem, the greatest vineyard in Sauternes.
Semillon gives the wine its brassy gold color, richly layered aroma
and breathtaking ripe, round flavor; the 25% Sauvignon Blanc in the
blend gives it a cool acidity.</LD>
<LD>   Incidentally, this almost 7-year-old dry white makes a
surprisingly sensible summer wine. Open it as an aperitif, pour it
with grilled fish and seafood--it's a particularly good match with
lobster or Santa Barbara prawns.</LD>
<TE>   $24.99 to $32.99. Available at Beverage Warehouse in Marina del
Rey, (310) 306-2822, and many Bristol Farms stores in Southern
California.</TE>

<LD>"The 2000 Elaine Mackie Zinfandel. I hired Elaine in 1990 when I was
president of the Napa Valley Vintners Assn. to be the executive
director. She was one of those fireballs, always a smile on her face.
She died of breast cancer in 1995 at age 39. Her husband and others
set up the Elaine Mackie Charitable Trust, and they do a lot of
fund-raisers. This is the trust's first wine--that's why it's so
memorable. Elaine was a nut about Zinfandel. It's marvelous, really
quite good. They only made 300 cases--my wife bought a case of it.
It's not only a good cause, but a good wine too."</LD>

<HD>O.C. Philharmonic Society Records $387,359 Shortfall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite an increase in attendance, record ticket income and a boost
in fund-raising, the Philharmonic Society of Orange County ran its
first deficit in a decade in 2001-02--a shortfall of $387,359,
according to figures released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The key problem, said associate director Sandy Robertson, was that
Sept. 11 struck just as the organization, one of Orange County's
three chief presenters, was putting on a push for its most ambitious
season. The third-annual Eclectic Orange Festival, a
multidisciplinary, multi-venue event that the society has made its
centerpiece, began on Sept. 28.</LD>
<LD>   "We got hit with that right up front," Robertson said. "It was a
very unusual year."</LD>
<TE>   Robertson said that even though ticket sales were up for the
year--65,000 compared with 45,600 the year before--they fell short of
what was needed to balance the budget in a season of expensive
productions, including visits by the Berlin and Vienna philharmonics,
the Southern California premiere of the Mark Morris staging of the
Rameau opera "Platee," and the U.S. premiere of Hal Hartley's
avant-garde play "Soon."</TE>
<TE>   Performance costs were $3.3 million, a $1.4-million increase over
the year before. Ticket income went up $530,000, from $1.24 million
to $1.77 million, and contributions grew $400,000, from $2.7 million
to $3.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine-based Philharmonic Society also had a $110,000 increase
in administrative and personnel costs. Total expenses were $5.27
million, and revenue was $4.88 million.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson said the society covered the deficit with money that had
built up from past years' surpluses.</TE>

<HD>NBC Plans Martha Stewart Biopic</HD>
<DH>Television* The network's entertainment chief also refuses
to rule out another season of 'Friends.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although NBC has dramatically cut back on its production of TV
movies, the network announced Tuesday that it is rushing a biography
of embattled lifestyle guru Martha Stewart into production, with
plans to have the project ready for the May rating sweeps.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing TV critics and reporters in Pasadena, NBC Entertainment
President Jeff Zucker also said it was premature to be overly
concerned about how NBC will get by without help from "Friends" after
the coming TV season, while refusing to close the door entirely on
the prospects of the top-rated comedy returning for a 10th year.</LD>
<LD>   Zucker said that the Stewart movie would be made as up-to-date as
possible to incorporate the recent controversy surrounding
allegations of insider trading on a stock sale, adding that it was
"an opportune time to put it into quick production."</LD>
<TE>   No casting has as yet been done on the project.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Stewart--who is most associated with CBS,
including, until recently, regular appearances on "The Early
Show"--declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   NBC approaches the upcoming season having finished first during
the 2001-02 campaign, and the network has added only five new
programs for the fall--with Zucker citing that stability as one of
NBC's key assets. Advertisers clearly embraced the schedule, as NBC
sold a record $2.7 billion in advance prime-time advertising, $800
million more than second-place CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the clock could be ticking on NBC's ratings dominance, with
"Friends," the key leadoff show to Thursday's "Must-See TV" lineup,
heading into what the handsomely paid cast has stated will be its
final year. Asked if there was any chance of extending the show,
Zucker said it's unlikely, but he "wouldn't 100% put nails in the
coffin."</TE>
<TE>   Assuming "Friends" does conclude next spring, however, NBC will
have sizable shoes to fill with no clear successor. Despite sources
who say there is considerable discussion within the network about
NBC's future, Zucker downplayed the idea that losing "Friends" was
cause for panic. The show will leave "a gaping hole," he said--as
"The Cosby Show" and "Cheers" did when they concluded their runs--but
he added, "We'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   One possible replacement is "Scrubs," which followed "Frasier"
last season and is moving to occupy the half-hour after "Friends."
Zucker stressed that NBC's expectation's are "realistic" given its
past struggles in filling that time period, hoping the new series can
retain 70% of the "Friends" audience among the young-adult
demographic sought by advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Most networks are planning special events to mark the one-year
anniversary of Sept. 11, and NBC will air a two-hour "Concert for
America," hosted by NBC News' Tom Brokaw. NBC will also televise the
nighttime Emmy Awards on Sept. 22, then launch all five new series
the following week, highlighted by a two-hour season premiere of
two-time Emmy best drama winner "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Having enjoyed some success with nostalgia last season, the
network announced plans for a "Hunter" movie with Fred Dryer and
Stepfanie Kramer--who starred in the NBC cop show from 1984-91--as
well as a behind-the-scenes look at the ABC series "Three's Company."</TE>

<KH>An Appreciation</KH>
<HD>He Heard America's Distinctive Songs</HD>
<DH>For 70 years, archivist Alan Lomax believed that the voice
of the common man needed to be heard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD HARRINGTON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Lomax recognized what Walt Whitman heard--America singing a
distinctly American folk song.</LD>
<LD>   But what Lomax heard in the 1930s lacked popular support, critical
acclaim and academic recognition. European traditions of classical
music and popular song, and the emerging home-grown idioms of blues
and jazz, were held in far greater esteem.</LD>
<LD>   For Lomax, however, folk music, handed down through generations
and inspired by common experience, was the truest expression of
America's character. For 70 years, he single-mindedly championed it
with recordings, songbooks and radio programs that propelled the
music into the commercial mainstream, helping spawn the folk
renaissance of the '40s and the folk revival of the '60s.</LD>
<TE>   The first to record Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie and Muddy Waters,
Lomax had a mission "to put neglected cultures and silenced people
into the communications chain." In addition to discovering,
instructing and otherwise championing artists, he helped establish
such institutions as the Library of Congress' Archive of American
Folk Song and the Global Jukebox, an interactive database that
explores the relationship between dance and song.</TE>
<TE>   Lomax, who died Friday at age 87, once insisted that "a folksinger
can reveal the character of his whole country." He was not much of a
singer himself. But as a documenter and disseminator of folk culture,
he was unparalleled, ceaselessly promoting the notion that "the voice
of the common people" needed to be heard, recognized, appreciated
and, most important, carried forward.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Alan Lomax, it was.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Seeger has been the most public face of the American folk
movement, and Harry Smith, curator of the "Anthology of American Folk
Music," has become its cult figurehead. However, it is impossible to
imagine the preservation of that music, and the unearthing of myriad
songs and singers, without acknowledging the lifelong commitment of
Lomax.</TE>
<TE>   Lomax first came to Washington in the early '30s when his father,
John Lomax, also a folklorist, was chosen to curate the still young
Archive of American Folk Song (Alan succeeded him in 1940). John
Lomax's 1910 book, "Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads," had
been a pioneering work in the field of music preservation, codifying
western themes and images that became the root of the "singing
cowboy" movement and country music. Its introduction (by former
President Theodore Roosevelt) outlined the guiding principle of Alan
Lomax's life--that folk songs and folklore were the true expression
of a people's culture.</TE>
<TE>   That lesson was further ingrained when a teenage Alan accompanied
his father through the South and Southwest in 1932. With a 500-pound
recording machine built into their car's trunk, they were among the
first folklorists to take recording equipment into the field. Alan
helped his father record and interview musicians, investigating not
just the songs, but also their histories, cultural contexts and
personal meaning.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Lomax was a product of the left-leaning populist idealism of
the '30s, centered in New York's intellectual-radical circles. That's
where the folk artists of the '40s and '50s gravitated, drawing from
the wellspring of American music the Lomaxes uncovered. Pete Seeger,
one of those acolytes, once said Lomax "purposely tried to infect us
with those songs" and political passion. On Saturday, Seeger told NPR
that "Alan was a young fellow who was out to make America more
democratic, and he thought American folk music could help do the
job."</TE>
<TE>   Lomax also bought into Whitman's vision of the U.S. as "a teeming
nation of nations" whose strength lay in its ability to absorb
different traditions. Long before it was popular, he saw the
interaction of African and Anglo cultures, noting "the profound
influence of this music on American culture.... With every passing
year, American music becomes more definitely an Anglo African blend."</TE>
<TE>   "The Land Where the Blues Began," Lomax's detailed recollection of
his work in the South, won the National Book Critics Circle Award for
nonfiction in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   At the Library of Congress, Lomax embarked on several seminal
recording projects. In 1938, he found New Orleans jazz composer and
pianist Jelly Roll Morton performing in relative obscurity in
Washington. Lomax recorded Morton, a genuine innovator who claimed to
have invented jazz at the turn of the century, in performances and
interviews at Coolidge Auditorium. This documentation formed the
basis of Lomax's 1950 biography "Mister Jelly Roll."</TE>
<TE>   Another great discovery was Oklahoma songwriter Woody Guthrie.
Lomax sat Guthrie down in a studio at the Department of the Interior
and recorded him singing and talking about his songs. Those
recordings were not commercially released until 1965, but Lomax
quickly guided Guthrie to Victor, where Guthrie's "Dust Bowl Ballads"
became the first serious presentation of protest songs and one of the
most influential American recordings of the 20th century. A
contemporary collection of labor and protest songs collected by
Lomax, Seeger and Guthrie, "Hard Hitting Songs for Hard-Hit People,"
proved too hot for the '40s. Finally published in 1967, the songbook
quickly became the bible of activist singers.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was Pete Seeger, who dropped out of Harvard to
travel through the South on recording expeditions with Lomax. Seeger
subsequently took a job at the Archive of Folk Song cataloging
materials and transcribing songs, in the process absorbing the huge
repertoire of ballads, work songs, lullabies and broadsides that
continue to inspire him.</TE>
<TE>   Under Lomax, the Archive of American Folk Song became a crucial
resource. But in 1942, a House committee killed the archive's funding
for a year.</TE>
<TE>   But Lomax did not abandon his mission. He continued to collect
songs and produce folk albums.</TE>

<HD>The Perfect Teammates: DVDs and Sports</HD>
<DH>Video* Fans with big home entertainment systems are the
format's marketing targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON MATSUMOTO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The booming DVD format has proved to be a popular vehicle for movies
and music-oriented presentations because of its pristine picture,
superior sound quality and extra features that make the VHS format
seem positively primitive by comparison. And now the professional
sports leagues are diving into this arena of home entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel that the demographic of the DVD buyer and the sports
demographic match up very well," says Sal Scamardo, vice president of
sports marketing for USA Home Entertainment. "There are lots of boys
with toys with big-screen TVs. They are usually the first to adapt to
these types of new technologies. Obviously, DVD has become more
mainstream, but our research has shown that the sports consumer
invests a lot in home entertainment systems and are heavy DVD users."</LD>
<LD>   But these men can be a particularly demanding audience, especially
after they've pumped hundreds and often thousands of dollars into a
big-screen television, a DVD player and a splashy 5:1 surround-sound
system. That's why sports producers are anxious to take advantage of
the DVD's technical superiority and ability to present enticing bonus
material.</LD>
<TE>   One of the primary objectives of "The Official NBA Finals 2002
Home Video," which was released Tuesday by USA Home Entertainment and
NBA Entertainment, is to bring the viewer as close to the experience
of sitting courtside at a game as possible. The DVD chronicles the
Lakers' recent ride to their third consecutive world championship and
includes plenty of floor-angle camera shots.</TE>
<TE>   "[DVD and surround sound] allow us to do a lot more sound
layering," notes Larry Weitzman, vice president of multimedia
production and programming for NBA Entertainment. "So you don't have
to worry, 'Are we pumping the music [too loud] or are we putting the
fans [too far up into the audio mix]?' Here you can hear rim snaps,
the sneaker squeaks, a little bit of the players grunting, plus the
fans and the music. It's such a clear and rich audio output."</TE>
<TE>   Q Video, which handles sales and marketing of DVDs and videos for
Major League Baseball, is preparing a project called "Major League
Baseball Superstar Cuts: When Baseball Rocks!" for release next
month. Designed in large part to take advantage of DVD's audio
capabilities and the rising sales of music DVDs, it will feature game
highlights set to music by recording artists such as Uncle Kracker,
Jimmy Eat World and Rob Zombie.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the extras, the material that can be included on
the DVD but won't fit on a videocassette. The DVD version of "The
Official NBA Finals 2002 Home Video," for example, includes a
60-minute main feature chronicling the Lakers' latest title run and
30 minutes of bonus material, including a look at Shaquille O'Neal's
history as a pro basketball player and a feature comparing Michael
Jordan with Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Since championship DVDs are produced quickly, however, they don't
always present the best or most comprehensive bonus features found on
sports DVDs. "Major League Baseball: All-Century Team," "Greatest
Moments In Super Bowl History" and "Ultimate Jordan" are general
titles that were created over longer periods of time and include a
wealth of ancillary features.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these sports DVDs, such as "Greatest Moments In Super Bowl
History," are constructed so that icons appear on the screen during
the regular documentary feature. By pushing "enter" on the remote
when these icons appear, viewers can access such features as
additional film footage, interviews and play analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "These icons allow you to pull down additional information on,
say, Vince Lombardi," explains Scamardo. "There might be an extra
eight minutes of footage or an interview that hadn't been seen for 30
years. Before DVD, a lot of valuable material ended up on the
cutting-room floor. What DVD allows us to do is to go back and
approach programming in a different way, where we can give the
viewers the option to elaborate on the story being told. Rather than
having just two minutes on Vince Lombardi in a 60-minute program,
suddenly you have 10 or 12 minutes, including a full interview."</TE>
<TE>   Lou Gehrig's "luckiest man" sound bite is familiar to many
baseball fans, but few have heard the speech in its entirety. The
"Major League Baseball: All-Century Team" DVD includes the complete
speech as bonus material.</TE>
<TE>   Multiple-angle viewing capability is also a feature that is
available with titles such as "Greatest Moments in Super Bowl
History" and "Greatest NBA Finals Moments." Fans have the option of
viewing certain key plays from different camera perspectives. Most
championship DVDs do not include this feature due to production time
constraints.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimate Jordan," which compiles five Michael Jordan VHS
documentaries onto a two-disc DVD set, includes a bevy of bonus
material. Jordan's greatest dunks, assists, moves and clutch shots
are presented as enticing extras. The Nike TV commercials he made
with Spike Lee are also offered.</TE>
<TE>   The Jordan DVD also operates as a DVD-ROM. Stats, trivia, a photo
gallery, a sample video game and a gallery of Jordan trading cards
manufactured by Upper Deck can all be accessed via computer. An
Internet link to nba.com allows fans to keep abreast of new
developments in the superstar's continuing basketball career.
("Ultimate Jordan" was released prior to his comeback last season
with the Washington Wizards.)</TE>
<TE>   "Greatest Moments in Super Bowl History" also operates as a
computer DVD-ROM, and this feature allows fans to see memorabilia up
close. Championship rings from every Super Bowl can be viewed as well
as the cover of every game program from America's most-watched
sporting event.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD format works hand in glove with the globalization of pro
sports. Major League Baseball now releases most of its DVD titles
with English, Spanish and Japanese language tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the NFL's Super Bowl DVD/video sold about
500,000 copies, nearly doubling the previous high for a similar type
Super Bowl documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Scamardo believes the increased popularity of DVDs played a
significant role in this sales feat. A year ago, he says, his
company's sports sales broke down to 60% VHS tapes and 40% DVD. This
year those figures have reversed.</TE>

<HD>Typecasting--Not</HD>
<DH>Tom Hanks' role as a hit man in 'Road to Perdition' is the
latest example of an actor diversifying a resume. Sometimes it works,
other times a performer never tries it again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In spite of a perceived affection for the familiar, audiences are
often eager for their favorite actors to change their spots and try
something different.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent example is Tom Hanks. Critics and moviegoers have
embraced his performance as a taciturn hit man in "Road to
Perdition." In just two weeks, the downbeat morality tale has earned
more than $47 million.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison Ford had less luck with his new film, the submarine
thriller "K-19: The Widowmaker," which eked out a disappointing $12.8
million its opening weekend. Ford's fans, it seems, couldn't buy Han
Solo and Indiana Jones as a dour Russian submarine commander,
although they had been willing to accept him as a homicidal husband
two years ago in "What Lies Beneath."</LD>
<TE>   Actors--let's make that stars--try an about-face of their usual
screen images for various reasons. They want to stretch as actors and
break out of what they perceive as a stereotype. Dramatic actors like
to try their hand at comedy, such as Emma Thompson in "Junior"
(1994). Comedic actors often try to shift their focus to drama, such
as Jim Carrey in "The Truman Show" (1998). Action star Arnold
Schwarzenegger proved he could tickle funny bones in "Twins" (1988)
and "Kindergarten Cop" (1990).</TE>
<TE>   When careers start to wane, performers often look for ways to
remake their images in hopes of giving their careers a boost. In
other circumstances, a director or producer often likes to cast
against type. Director Billy Wilder was exceptionally astute in
bringing out different aspects of an actor's personality, for
example, casting good guy Fred MacMurray as the murdering insurance
agent in "Double Indemnity" (1944) and as the womanizing heel in "The
Apartment" (1960). Wilder took Ray Milland, best known for his
comedic roles, and cast him in his Oscar-winning part as the
dipsomaniac in "The Lost Weekend" (1945).</TE>
<TE>   In reviews of "Road to Perdition," critics have observed that
Hanks is following in the career footsteps of Jimmy Stewart, who made
his film debut in 1935. Stewart made his mark before World War II
playing boy-next-door, aw-shucks types in Frank Capra's "You Can't
Take It With You" (1938) and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939)
and in his Oscar-winning role in "The Philadelphia Story" (1940). His
fans, though, tend to forget that he played murderers in two films
from 1936--"After the Thin Man" and "Rose Marie."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart left Hollywood at 34 to fight in World War II and came
back three years later. Not only had he aged during his years in
combat, his persona had a world-weary quality. The boy-next-door was
gone and his film roles reflected that. Even in the Capra holiday
classic "It's a Wonderful Life" from 1946, his character of George
Bailey is at the brink of despair and contemplates suicide. Darker
roles followed in the late '40s, including the Alfred Hitchcock
murder mystery "Rope" (1948).</TE>
<TE>   But it was really in the 1950s that the edgier, hardened Stewart
image blossomed. Teaming up in 1950 with director Anthony Mann for
"Winchester '73," the two made a series of gritty westerns in which
Stewart played an uneasy protagonist. And that image was further
enhanced by Hitchcock, who cast Stewart in two of his best films from
the '50s: "Rear Window" (1954) and "Vertigo" (1958). Especially with
"Vertigo," it is difficult to believe that the obsessed police
detective is the same man who played the naive young senator in "Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Like Stewart, Jack Lemmon began his film career with light, airy
comedies such as "It Should Happen to You" and "Pffft" (both 1954),
winning his first Oscar for "Mister Roberts" (1955) for his
supporting performance as the ambitious young Ensign Pulver.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the 1960 Oscar-winning Wilder comedy "The
Apartment" that he got his real chance to show off his dramatic chops
in the cynical, dark comedy about a young man desperate to climb the
corporate ladder. Audiences and critics admired the darker side to
Lemmon's breezy screen personality.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, he received a best actor nomination for his raw
performance as a young alcoholic in Blake Edwards' unflinching "The
Days of Wine and Roses." The movie put Lemmon on the map as a
dramatic actor, and 11 years later he won his second Oscar--this time
for best actor--as a desperate garment manufacturer in "Save the
Tiger." Though he continued to star in numerous comedies until his
death last year, Lemmon is often best remembered for his dramatic
turns in these films as well as in "Missing" (1982) and "The China
Syndrome" (1979).</TE>
<TE>   Everybody gets bored at some time or another with their jobs. Even
actors. They feel they are in a rut and want to try something
different. But often, actors choose the wrong time or the wrong
vehicle. And fans don't always want to see their favorites playing
against type.</TE>
<TE>   Clark Gable was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood--the king of
the MGM lot--known for his comedic flair in "It Happened One Night"
(1934), for which he won his only Oscar, and playing he-men in such
films as "Manhattan Melodrama" (1934) and "Mutiny on the Bounty"
(1935).</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps being the "king" of the box office gave Gable a swelled
head. Why else would he have starred in the 1937 film "Parnell"? The
macho Gable seemed out of place in this bloated melodrama as Irish
politician Charles Stewart Parnell, who struggled to gain
independence for his country from England. The film was Gable's
biggest financial disaster and he vowed never to do a period piece
again or an Irish accent for that matter. Thanks to the prodding of
MGM, he did play Rhett Butler two years later in "Gone With the
Wind," but Gable never again attempted a role so out of his league.</TE>
<TE>   Tyrone Power was another one of Hollywood's major box-office
stars. After his first starring role in "Lloyd's of London" (1936),
he was a dependable, handsome leading man who starred in everything
from dashing period pieces such as "The Mark of Zorro" (1940) to
Sonja Henie ice-skating musicals such as "Thin Ice" (1937) to
melodramas such as "The Rains Came" (1939).</TE>
<TE>   Returning to Hollywood after serving in World War II, Power
immediately starred in two box-office hits, the 1946 drama "The
Razor's Edge" and the 1947 swashbuckler "Captain From Castile." Both
films didn't stray much from Power's prewar persona.</TE>
<TE>   But audiences stayed away in droves when he did "Nightmare Alley,"
also released in 1947. Fans didn't want to see their wholesome idol
play a heel in this gritty film noir. It was their loss. Power
arguably gives his best performance in this drama as a conniving
young man working in a carnival who stops at nothing to achieve
success. The final scene in the film in which he is reduced to
playing a geek in the carny sideshow was just too much for postwar
audiences to take.</TE>
<TE>   With the failure of "Nightmare Alley," Power returned to roles
audiences were more comfortable seeing him in. It wasn't until
"Witness for the Prosecution" (1957) that Power was able to parlay
his good looks and charm into an evil character.</TE>
<TE>   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences loves it when
actors change their spots. Hanks won his first Oscar playing a young
lawyer dying of AIDS in "Philadelphia" (1993). Ginger Rogers and
Grace Kelly received Oscars for changing things up. In Rogers' case,
she spent most of the 1930s as the delectable partner of Fred Astaire
in a series of seminal movie musicals for RKO such as "The Gay
Divorcee," "Swing Time" and "Top Hat." And when she wasn't dancing
the continental with Astaire, Rogers was starring in a series of
sparkling romantic comedies such as "Vivacious Lady" (1938) and
"Bachelor Mother" (1939).</TE>
<TE>   When Rogers and Astaire parted company after 1939's "The Story of
Vernon and Irene Castle," Rogers darkened her long blond locks and
went dramatic in "Kitty Foyle" (1940), playing an unwed mother. She
so impressed academy members with her change-of-pace role that she
won the best actress Oscar, beating out such favorites as Joan
Fontaine in "Rebecca," Katharine Hepburn in "The Philadelphia Story"
and Bette Davis in "The Letter."</TE>
<TE>   Although she had only been in films for three years, Grace Kelly
was the epitome of sophistication and glamour in such films as "Rear
Window." But she deglamorized herself for "The Country Girl" (1954),
playing the long-suffering, bitter wife of an alcoholic singer (Bing
Crosby, who also changed his spots for this role). Transforming
herself into a rather dowdy woman, Kelly won her only Oscar, beating
out the favorite, Judy Garland, in "A Star Is Born."</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary stars have had a mixed report card when it comes to
tackling different parts. Bill Murray was miscast in the vapid 1984
remake of "The Razor's Edge." Murray essayed the Tyrone Power role of
an altruistic young man trying to find himself between the two World
Wars. Though it was supposed to be a drama, Murray played everything
with a smirk and a grin. The film tanked, and Murray has never
attempted another straight dramatic role.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Martin had a starring role in just one film, "The Jerk"
(1979), when he was cast in the downbeat Depression-era drama with
music, "Pennies From Heaven" (1981). Audiences didn't want to see the
"wild and crazy guy" from "Saturday Night Live" playing a two-timing
salesman accused of murder. Seventeen years later, though, Martin
found the perfect vehicle to show off his dramatic side, playing a
mysterious executive in David Mamet's enigmatic "The Spanish
Prisoner."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Carrey has endured a bumpy road trying to make the transition
from comedic genius to dramatic star. He won the Golden Globe and the
hearts of critics and fans with "The Truman Show" (1998). Under
director Peter Weir's guidance, he was able to transform his often
out-of-control antics into a more dramatic style. But he hasn't had
much luck since then. He won the Golden Globe playing the
iconoclastic comic Andy Kaufman in "The Man in the Moon" (1999), but
audiences stayed away, as they did for last year's "The Majestic," in
which he gave it his Jimmy Stewart best in the languid melodrama that
was part fable, part blacklist expose.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes an image makeover is just the ticket for a flagging
career. Frank Sinatra, for example, was one of the biggest recording
artists and movie stars during the 1940s, starring in one hit musical
after another, such as "Anchors Aweigh" (1945) and "On the Town"
(1949). But both his singing and acting career began to wane in the
early 1950s. He left MGM and made a few forgettable films at other
studios, such as "Meet Danny Wilson" (1952) and "Double Dynamite"
(1951).</TE>
<TE>   Sinatra's luck changed when he landed the role of the doomed
Italian American soldier Maggio in "From Here to Eternity" (1953). He
won the Oscar for best supporting actor and found himself one of the
top dramatic actors in Hollywood. The following year he played an
assassin in the cult film "Suddenly" and received another Oscar
nomination for his gritty turn as a heroin addict in the 1955 film
"The Man With the Golden Arm." Thereafter, Sinatra was better able to
work in different genres.</TE>

<HD>Why Do Critics Confab for This Stuff?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Cedric the Entertainer, star of a new comedy-variety series on Fox,
was kidding Sunday when he said to TV critics that with the seeds of
a new television season planted, "you ... are the fertilizer that
will help those shows grow." Still, it was one of those jokes made
funnier by the awkward ring of truth.</LD>
<LD>   The twice annual Television Critics Assn. tour--a multi-network
showcase held in Pasadena the past three weeks--doesn't end until
Friday, but it probably can't come too soon for the critics, who
beyond sheer exhaustion can doubtless relate to the fertilizer
analogy, having been repeatedly told how irrelevant they are.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, you won't hear such pronouncements from HBO, largely
because the pay service plays by a different rule book--one placing a
huge premium on high-class (and often little-seen) productions that
generate award nominations and glowing reviews, seizing on critics'
approval as another incentive for consumers to subscribe.</LD>
<TE>   Advertiser-supported networks, by contrast, have always been
driven by a commercial imperative frequently at odds with such
acclaim--tension that appears to be growing as sales departments push
programmers to reach the young and restless, which increasingly means
catering to the undiscriminating and fickle.</TE>
<TE>   Why should programmers fret excessively about critics, then, when
notoriety and curiosities--think Fox's "Celebrity Boxing" and E!'s
upcoming Anna Nicole Smith show--too often trump positive reviews, as
viewers pause to examine some new car crash along the information
superhighway?</TE>
<TE>   This attitude has come through loud and clear as broadcast
executives politely and sometimes not-so-politely explained their
programming strategies in recent weeks. Officials at the WB implied
that the mostly middle-aged critics are too old to appreciate the
network's youth-oriented programs. ABC said its new shows are meant
for people simply looking for entertainment after a hard day at work,
not critics hoping to be surprised and challenged. "We'll leave
groundbreaking to someone else," ABC Entertainment President Susan
Lyne said.</TE>
<TE>   NBC has consistently reminded critics that programs such as "Fear
Factor" and "Dog Eat Dog" are aimed at "real" people, not them--to
the point where critics barely asked about such shows Tuesday, though
even rival networks are wondering how low the network can limbo with
such fare. CBS Television President Leslie Moonves, meanwhile,
defended plans for a Victoria's Secret lingerie special by saying the
network "isn't your grandmother's CBS," which may come as a shock to
the millions of grandmothers who help constitute the network's
older-skewing audience.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, after garnering honors from the critics for its new series
"24" and "The Bernie Mac Show," did offer thanks for the praise, only
to be asked if these brushes with quality hastened last season's
spiral into the ratings toilet. Notably, the network has received a
ratings boost this summer from the talent show "American Idol,"
essentially a product-placement vehicle for Ford and Coke barely
watchable to anyone older than 18.</TE>
<TE>   For these reasons and others, it may be time to consider retiring
the press tour--which admittedly serves a purpose but doesn't do so
as well as it should or once did for any of its constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, networks love the publicity, especially now that it's so
difficult to launch new programs, but they hate the expense. Critics
love the access to people and programs they cover but understandably
hate most of the shows and have reason to feel that way about many of
the people--prone as they are to parrot back answers in a carefully
massaged corporate-speak that doesn't belong in a press release, much
less a newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The event also promotes various bad habits, perhaps foremost among
them lazy language, beginning with "The critics love this" or hate
that, as if they were all of one mind. Although many major critics
are represented, arguably the two most respected--The Times' Howard
Rosenberg and the Washington Post's Tom Shales, both Pulitzer Prize
winners--don't attend.</TE>
<TE>   "I never have liked the concept of lock-step critics and the
notion of a consensus, a kind of party line, that you have to adhere
to," Shales said via e-mail from Washington, adding that he bristles
at the idea of "the critics loved it," especially in cases when he
didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Sequestering critics in a hotel together potentially helps fosters
such group-think, which seems antithetical to the lonely art of
criticism. Forced into what could pass for a version of CBS' "Big
Brother" minus the cash prize, critics can't help but talk shop
occasionally, in the same way doctors discuss surgical procedures at
medical conventions.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to say that a gathering of TV critics should be limited
to talking about baseball or zoology, but because individual taste is
so subjective, it's worth questioning whether they should assemble at
all. Rosenberg, for example, expressed concern about a pack mentality
and prefers not to share margaritas with people he might have to
criticize, avoiding any chance it might color his opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Network executives keep ruminating on ways to reinvent their
business, just as journalists struggle with adapting to a new era
complicated by 24-hour news channels, the Internet's ability to
propel rumors around the globe and legitimate apprehension that a
generation bred on MTV won't be predisposed to read.</TE>
<TE>   So rather than move the TV critics tour from Pasadena to Hollywood
in January, as is the current plan, maybe it's time to contemplate
letting the whole event sink quietly into the sunset and craft an
alternative.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, networks could make stars and executives available
via conference calls and plow the money saved on lavish soirees into
marketing their shows, or better yet, developing a few riskier
scripts, which would yield more laudatory reviews than any number of
cocktail parties with the cast of "CSI: Miami."</TE>
<TE>   As for the critics, it's not as if meeting the producers of
"Temptation Island" is going to enhance anyone's understanding of the
show, or for that matter make it any better. Besides, with the media
world having become so frenzied, there are other things we could all
be doing with our time.</TE>
<TE>   You know, like watching HBO.</TE>

<LD>   Cashing In on the Man in Black's Birthday</LD>
<LD>   Johnny Cash is the subject of David and Goliath tribute albums
scheduled to be released a week apart in September in conjunction
with Cash's 70th birthday celebrations this year.</LD>
<TE>   The big-name tribute coming Sept. 24, "Kindred Spirits: A Tribute
to the Songs of Johnny Cash," includes performances by Bruce
Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Sheryl Crow, Dwight Yoakam, Hank Williams
Jr., Keb' Mo' and others. A lower-profile batch of roots-music acts,
including former Mavericks singer Raul Malo, Dave Alvin, James
Intveld, Rosie Flores and Hank Williams III, is featured on "Dressed
in Black: A Tribute to Johnny Cash," arriving Sept. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia/Legacy Records also continues its series of 70th-birthday
releases with four vintage Cash albums coming in August and
September, including the previously unreleased "Johnny Cash at
Madison Square Garden," a live album recorded in 1969. Cash turned 70
on Feb. 26.</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson Snipes at ABC's Newsmagazines</TE>
<TE>   Sam Donaldson has kept a low profile ever since ABC announced that
political commentator George Stephanopoulos would be replacing him
and Cokie Roberts as host of its Sunday morning news show "This
Week."</TE>
<TE>   But now he's speaking out. Though he has "no issues" with
Stephanopoulos, he tells TV Guide, he's far from impressed with the
state of ABC newsmagazines such as "20/20" and "PrimeTime: Thursday."
He and Diane Sawyer hosted the latter show from 1989 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early days when Diane and I started 'PrimeTime,' " he
says, "most every piece we did I was proud of and could defend. I
can't make the same statement today.... I'm talking about my own
taste. If you like murder or rape or multiple-birth or
diet-pill-of-the-week stories and want to watch them, fine. But if we
say it's ABC News, we should be a little better than that."</TE>
<TE>   His primary focus now is his syndicated radio program "Sam
Donaldson Live in America," which began in September.</TE>
<TE>   'Hardball's' Matthews Out With Malaria</TE>
<TE>   Chris Matthews, host of MSNBC's "Hardball with Chris Matthews,"
has been hospitalized with malaria, the cable channel said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The journalist, who has traveled extensively throughout Africa,
Southeast Asia and the Middle East, is expected to leave Sibley
Memorial Hospital in Washington later this week and return to his
weekday series shortly thereafter. Veteran newspaper and television
journalist Mike Barnicle, will guest host until he returns.</TE>
<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   'Aladdin' Headed for Theme Park Stage</TE>
<TE>   Anne Hamburger, former artistic director of the La Jolla
Playhouse, joined the Walt Disney Co. two years ago. Her mandate: to
recruit performing arts and theatrical talent into the theme park
arena and elevate the quality of the entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Her first production is "Disney's Aladdin--Live on Stage," a
musical to be performed in the 2,000-seat Hyperion Theatre at
Disney's California Adventure in Anaheim starting Dec. 9. The piece
is based on the animated Disney movie, whose score--by Alan Menken,
Howard Ashman and Tim Rice--will be retained. Hamburger, however, has
brought in a high-powered creative team to move the vision along.</TE>
<TE>   There's international opera director Francesca Zambello (the L.A.
Opera's "Billy Budd"), Broadway choreographer Lynne Taylor-Corbett
("Swing," "Titanic") and Tony Award-winning set designer Peter J.
Davison ("Copenhagen"). The book will be written by Chad Beguelin
("The Rhythm Club").</TE>
<TE>   Hamburger, who made her reputation through New York City's En
Garde Arts, says she's comfortable with her new, less-traditional
theater life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm painting on a much larger palette now, commissioning and
developing theatrical productions for California, Florida, Paris and
Tokyo," she said Tuesday. "And I'm bringing world-class talent to
millions of people, many of whom don't go to the theater very often."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Conan O'Brien has been tapped to host the 54th-annual prime-time
Emmy Awards, airing on NBC Sept. 22 .... Sunday's season premiere of
"Sex and the City" averaged 7.9 million viewers, a record for the HBO
series....The Coen Brothers, the duo responsible for the hit musical
fable "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" are producing "Romance and
Cigarettes," a musical written by John Turturro....Despite NASA's
concerns about whether he has enough education and fluency in
Russian, 'N Sync's Lance Bass has signed a contract to join the
Russians on an October Soyuz flight to the International Space
Station, Eonline reports.... Discovery Communications plans to run
"Faces of Sept. 11," a 14-hour series of documentaries on the
terrorist attacks of last year, on five cable channels beginning Aug.
29, including TLC and Discovery....The 28th Deauville American Film
Festival, running Aug. 30 to Sept. 8, will pay tribute to actress
Ellen Burstyn, the late director John Frankenheimer and producer
Robert Evans, according to the Hollywood Reporter....Starting in
September, singer Donny Osmond will host "Pyramid," a syndicated
revival of the game show formerly hosted by Dick Clark.</TE>

<HD>In the Periscope: Submarine Standouts</HD>
<DH>Movies* From the silent era to the current 'K-19,' undersea
adventures have been a staple. 'Das Boot' is regarded as the best.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Submarines have been favorite movie subjects since the earliest days
of cinema. From such silents as "The Aerial Submarine" (1910) and
"Submarine Chase" (1917) to "K-19: The Widowmaker," which opened
Friday, submarine movies have come in myriad forms, including war
films, fantasy adventures, comedies and even an animated pop-art
musical. Here's a look at some of the more notable submarine films
that have floated by over the years.</LD>
<LD>   "Submarine" (1928): This effective Frank Capra thriller, starring
Jack Holt and Ralph Graves, deals with the rescue of a submarine sunk
off the San Diego coast during exercises that trap the crew some 400
feet below the surface.</LD>
<LD>   "Devil and the Deep" (1932): Tallulah Bankhead is at her
melodramatic best in this deliciously silly 1932 drama as the wife of
a jealous submarine commander (Charles Laughton). Gary Cooper, a
lieutenant on his sub, just happens to be having an affair with
Bankhead. Laughton seeks revenge and the trio ends up on a crippled
submarine. Cary Grant, in one of his earliest roles, plays another
officer on board the craft who catches the eye of Bankhead.</LD>
<TE>   "Crash Dive" (1943): Tyrone Power, Dana Andrews and Anne Baxter
headline this World War II action-adventure that won an Oscar for its
special effects. The battle sequences are still effective, but the
story, which finds the sub lieutenant and his commander in love with
the same girl, is strictly standard issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Destination Tokyo" (1943): Eleven years after he appeared in
"Devil and the Deep," Cary Grant headlined this action-packed World
War II flick. Grant plays the stalwart commander of a U.S. submarine
who sneaks the sub into Tokyo Bay to gain information for the first
air raid over Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   "We Dive at Dawn" (1943): Anthony Asquith directed this patriotic
British World War II flick starring the always dependable John Mills
as the commander of an English submarine sent to sink a new German
battleship. The mission leads the crew so far from home base that the
sub begins to run out of fuel.</TE>
<TE>   "Submarine Command" (1951): John Farrow--Mia's father--directed
this seaworthy World War II drama that explores the personal and
professional lives of a submarine crew. William Holden, Nancy Olsen
and William Bendix star.</TE>
<TE>   "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" (1954): Walt Disney's fanciful and
exciting adaptation of the Jules Verne adventure novel is jampacked
with then-cutting-edge special effects, fast-paced action and strong
performances. The story revolves around a ship sent to investigate a
rash of mysterious sinkings. It encounters the brilliant but mad
Captain Nemo, who commands the technologically advanced submarine,
the Nautilus. Kirk Douglas, James Mason, Paul Lukas and Peter Lorre
star in this family film directed by Richard Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   "The Enemy Below" (1957): Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens star in
this no-nonsense World War II thriller ably directed by Dick Powell.
Mitchum is the captain of a U.S. destroyer who engages in
cat-and-mouse maneuvers in the Atlantic with the erudite Jurgens, the
commander of a German sub.</TE>
<TE>   "Run Silent, Run Deep" (1958): Robert Wise directed this taut
World War II thriller--sort of a twist on "Moby Dick"-- starring
Clark Gable as a stoic submarine commander who is obsessed with
sinking a specific Japanese ship. Burt Lancaster plays the
strong-willed lieutenant who is always locking horns with Gable. Jack
Warden, Don Rickles and Brad Dexter head the sturdy supporting cast.</TE>
<TE>   "Operation Petticoat" (1959): Cary Grant finds himself submerged
once again in Blake Edwards' giddy World War II farce. Grant plays a
by-the-book commander who is given a rather decrepit and pink-colored
sub to navigate in the Pacific. Tony Curtis also shines as his
fast-talking con man of an executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" (1961): A silly action-adventure
written and directed by the master of movie disasters, Irwin Allen.
It stars a stiff Walter Pidgeon as the admiral of a U.S. nuclear
submarine whose mission is to save the Earth from the Van Allen
radiation belt that has caught on fire. Of course, there are even
more fireworks among the crew, which includes Joan Fontaine, Barbara
Eden and Frankie Avalon (who also croons the dreadful theme song).</TE>
<TE>   "Yellow Submarine" (1968): Gorgeous, clever and groovy animated
musical adventure in which the Beatles rescue Pepperland from the
evil Blue Meanies. Based on the Beatles' hit tune from 1966, the
score includes such Fab Four standards as "Lucy in the Sky With
Diamonds" as well as the peppy "All Together Now."</TE>
<TE>   "Ice Station Zebra" (1968): John Sturges directed this overlong
but intermittently entertaining action-thriller. It's based on the
Alistair MacLean novel about a U.S. submarine dispatched to the North
Pole to retrieve a downed satellite that contains a roll of film of
both American and Russian missile sites. Of course, the Russians are
also eager to get their hands on the film. Rock Hudson is the sub
commander, and Ernest Borgnine is a Russian defector helping them
retrieve the film. The scene-stealer, though, is Patrick McGoohan as
an acerbic secret agent.</TE>
<TE>   "Das Boot" (1981): The "Citizen Kane" of submarine movies.
Wolfgang Petersen directed this powerful, visceral drama that
explores the claustrophobic existence aboard a cramped, dismal German
U-boat during World War II. Jurgen Prochnow heads the cast.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hunt for Red October" (1990): Based on the best-selling Tom
Clancy Cold War thriller, this suspenseful, well-acted film stars
Sean Connery as the commander of a secret Russian nuclear sub who may
or may not be trying to defect to the U.S. Alec Baldwin matches
Connery every step of the way in his one and only appearance as
scrappy American intelligence agent Jack Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   "Crimson Tide" (1995): It's great fun to watch Oscar winners Gene
Hackman and Denzel Washington squaring off in this glossy Jerry
Bruckheimer production. Set aboard a nuclear sub, the action revolves
around the trigger-happy commander (Hackman) and his young executive
(Washington).</TE>
<TE>   "U-571" (2002): Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel
and Jon Bon Jovi head the cast of this thrilling action-adventure set
during World War II. It's about a group of American submariners who
disguise themselves as Germans to board a Nazi submarine in order to

<LD>Since its debut on PBS in January, "American Family" has won praise
as the first Latino drama on U.S. broadcast television. The first 13
episodes did well enough that PBS decided to pick up nine more, and
Mexico's Televisa network has announced plans to air all of them in
the fall.</LD>
<LD>   The series, set in East Los Angeles, follows life with the
Gonzalezes, a Mexican American family with strong cultural and family
ties south of the border. Patriarch Jess Gonzalez (Edward James
Olmos) owns a barbershop. Nina (Constance Marie) is a lawyer; another
daughter, Vangie (Rachel Ticotin), a fashion designer; Esteban (Esai
Morales), a firefighter. And flamboyant Aunt Dora (Raquel Welch) is a
Hollywood star manquee.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's episode (9 p.m., KCET and KVCR) focuses on Vangie, who
gets an opportunity to work for a major retailer--if she can come up
with the money to step up production.</LD>
<TE>   Series creator Gregory Nava took "American Family" to Mexico to
film the two season-ending episodes. In "The Journey," due to air
Aug. 28 and Sept. 4, Jess travels to Mexico's southern Oaxaca state
to learn more about the childhood of his late wife; Esteban arrives
in Mexico City to try to rescue his relationship with his girlfriend;
and Nina heads to southern Chiapas to deliver humanitarian aid to
poor Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Filming in Mexico was a homecoming for the show's cast and its
characters, Nava said. Olmos grew up in East Los Angeles but has
family in Mexico; Nava is from San Diego with relatives in Tijuana;
and Kate del Castillo, who plays Esteban's girlfriend, is from Mexico
City. "This journey is a real universal thing, I think, for Americans
to come to grips with their past, the past of their families," Nava
said.</TE>

<LD>Unscripted summer replacement shows continue to make inroads as an
alternative to network reruns, boosting results for NBC, Fox and CBS
last week, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media
Research.</LD>
<LD>   NBC's "Dog Eat Dog" and Fox's "American Idol" remain success
stories. Both shows are performing disproportionately well among
young adult viewers, with the latter's two editions topping the
weekly standings among adults ages 18 to 49. Bolstered by "Idol" (and
baseball's All-Star Game a few weeks ago), Fox has now at least
shared first place by that measure three straight weeks--a record for
the network.</LD>
<LD>   Results have been somewhat more uneven for CBS' third edition of
"Big Brother," with the show faring best on Wednesdays.</LD>
<TE>   CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and NBC's "Law &amp; Order"
franchise also continue to exhibit impressive repeatability, in
contrast to many other dramatic series; in fact, four programs under
the "Law" umbrella placed in the top 20, including the reality-based
"Crime &amp; Punishment."</TE>
<TE>   ABC, meanwhile, is still struggling. Other than newsmagazines
"PrimeTime Thursday" and "20/20," its next most-watched program was
"America's Funniest Home Videos" at No. 48 last week.</TE>

<TE>   National Nielsen Viewership</TE>
<TE>   Here are the rankings for national prime-time network television
last week (July 15-21) as compiled by Nielsen Media Research. They
are based on the average number of people who watched a program from
start to finish. Nielsen estimates there are 269 million potential
viewers in the U.S. age 2 and older. Viewership is listed in
millions.</TE>

<HD>A Cross-Dressed Counterrevolution</HD>
<DH>Movies* Two filmmakers reconnect with the '60s as they
document the rise and fall of the glittery drag performers the
Cockettes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE VALDESPINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>November 1971. A packed house at the Anderson Theater in New York,
strewn with celebrities and socialites, waited to see the latest San
Francisco sensation, the Cockettes. But when the curtain rose, the
show didn't live up to its hype.</LD>
<LD>   A grossly under-rehearsed, elaborately overdressed collection of
hippies, drag queens and acid freaks ran through a loosey-goosey
musical of their own trippy invention. They could feel themselves
bombing as audience members left in disgust. "No talent is not
enough!" said Gore Vidal. "WHAT A DRAG," screamed the headline of a
scorched-earth review.</LD>
<LD>   An agonizing night off-Broadway? Yeah. A great subject for a
documentary? Oh, yeah. Directors David Weissman and Bill Weber
devoted two years to chronicling the formation and dissolution of the
Cockettes, a cult act from the City of Love. Their film, "The
Cockettes," opens Friday in Los Angeles. It received its premiere at
the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 2001
and was shown after the awards presentation Sunday at Los Angeles'
Outfest. It also was broadcast on the Sundance Channel in June and
will repeat in June next year.</LD>
<TE>   "It's really about the counterculture of the '60s and how that
blended with the beginnings of the sexual revolution," said Weissman.
"The Cockettes offered an opportunity to tell that story."</TE>
<TE>   The tale steered Weissman and Weber straight into a big, messy
zeitgeist stew: gay liberation, freedom of expression,
countercultural lifestyles, gender bending, free love, drugs,
communal living and politics.</TE>
<TE>   Their approach to the tangled subject was to show all points of
view. "I'm always struck by how five people can be at the same event
and have differences about what happened," said Weber.</TE>
<TE>   "History becomes mythology, and we were comfortable with that,"
Weissman said.</TE>
<TE>   The film's strength, writes Jeffrey M. Anderson of the San
Francisco Examiner, is that "it leaves certain details
purposely--tantalizingly--misty." "The Cockettes" captures a delicate
point in time and holds it like a butterfly in a net, say most of the
critics. It brings the era "triumphantly to life," A.O. Scott writes
in the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Weber and Weissman got a jump-start on the research from Martin
Worman, a former Cockette who died in 1993, but not before beginning
a dissertation on the group. "He had 100 interviews, 30 to 40 hours
already transcribed. We had a tremendous history that was a huge
help," said Weber.</TE>
<TE>   A treasure trove of archives included costumes, scrapbooks,
photographs and films as well as interviews with a range of subjects,
from the theater owner who gave them their first break to director
John Waters, a fan of the troupe who introduced them to Divine, the
star of his film "Pink Flamingos." But most of it is straight from
former Cockettes, whose names seem lifted off a Jefferson Airplane
lyric sheet: Scrumbly, Sweet Pam, Hibiscus, Jilala, Goldie Glitters,
Dusty Dawn, Ocean Michael Moon and others.</TE>
<TE>   The Cockettes--many still wearing outrageous hats and too much
mascara--relive the halcyon days of the troupe founded by George
Harris, a young actor who left New York, changed his name to Hibiscus
and moved into Kaliflower, a San Francisco commune. Rock-star
handsome, with silky, shoulder-length hair fit for an Herbal Essence
shampoo commercial, Hibiscus was described by one Cockette as "Jesus
Christ with lipstick." Where he led, they followed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was gorgeous and inspirational and charismatic and totally
visual," said Fayetta Hauser, an art student who attended Boston
University at the time Timothy Leary conducted acid experiments at
MIT. She hitched a ride out West with no less than Nancy Gurley, wife
of James Gurley, a guitarist for Janis Joplin's backup band, Big
Brother and the Holding Company.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of things I learned in school were in theory only, so
between the acid and life in San Francisco and Hibiscus, it all
started bursting out of my head," Hauser said.</TE>
<TE>   Their first performances started as group dances in public spaces.
Later the shows took on titles: "Hot Greeks," "Gone With the Showboat
to Oklahoma" and "Journey to the Center of Uranus." Dressing up was a
signature. The Cockettes raided thrift shops and donned headdresses,
boas, heels and layers of glittery makeup until they looked like
Mardi Gras in search of Bourbon Street.</TE>
<TE>   Some were gay. Some were straight. Some took acid. Some took their
clothes off. Rehearsals were a zoo.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big psychodrama, like an insane asylum," said Hauser.
"Sometimes I would just sit back and watch what was going on; a lot
of drag queens would be vying for the same role and throwing
tantrums, and people would be singing and playing the piano--how we
ever did a show is beyond me."</TE>
<TE>   In the 2 1/2 years the group was together, all attempts to get
them to behave failed miserably. Pianist Peter Mintun said that for a
time he was the only professional in the group. "Very often a
rehearsal would be called for noon and I'd arrive at 1 and be only
person there. Finally one person would straggle in with a grocery bag
full of secondhand clothes and rhinestone jewelry and another would
come in with more stuff, and they'd all compare notes."</TE>
<TE>   Two or three stood out, but the rest weren't fit for amateur
productions, Mintun said. "I was trying to teach one of them a song
and kept asking, 'Why don't you ever sing the words?' And this
person, who was 18, said, 'I'm embarrassed to say this, but I don't
know how to read.' And still, this person had dreams of being a
performer," Mintun said.</TE>
<TE>   "A big part of the show was the audience, because they would come
in costume and respond and overreact and encourage people who had no
talent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The drug thing held them back: At times, members of the Cockettes
were so high they were tableaux rather than musical theater. And
there was the free love thing. It would take a flowchart to track all
the couplings and uncouplings. Sweet Pam and Scrumbly got married and
had a son (Cactus). But they didn't stay married because Scrumbly was
actually gay. Dusty Dawn had a baby too. And weren't Fayetta and
Marshall a couple for a while?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anybody who wasn't a couple for at least one night,"
said Weissman.</TE>
<TE>   As with many rock groups, "artistic differences" developed and the
Cockettes split. Some wanted to become a real theater troupe with a
board of directors. Hibiscus didn't. He felt the performances should
remain experimental and free of charge. He left the Cockettes to form
the Angels of Light Free Theater Collective.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary does not shy away from the bittersweet denouement
of these stage-struck flower children.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years they lost members to drug overdoses and AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Many simply moved out of the Haight and on with their lives.
Hauser is now a photo stylist for glossy magazines such as Bon
Appetit. Mintun went back to New York to resume his career as a
pianist, specializing in playing vintage American songs in posh
hotels. Even Hibiscus cut his hair and went back to acting, appearing
in soap operas before he died of complications of AIDS in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Their spectacular flop in New York seemed prophetic. Freaky,
fantasy-laden and laced with drugs and attitude, their act seemed
untranslatable, tied to a time and place that was slowly fading into
history.</TE>
<TE>   So, the glory days--of being feted by Andy Warhol and Robert
Rauschenberg--may be gone, but the filmmakers and the remaining
Cockettes hope that with the release of the documentary, their
freewheeling spirit may live on.</TE>
<TE>   "The '60s generation is responding in emotional ways," said
Weissman. "It's giving them a renewed appreciation for something that
has been repressed for years. For the anti-hippie younger generation,
the movie gives them a new sense of what that time was about."</TE>
<TE>   In a three-week run at a theater in San Francisco's Castro
district, the crowds got younger, and Weissman said he found that
gratifying.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make a movie about the timelessness of being a
rebel."</TE>

<HD>Anxiety Builds Over AOL Earnings Release</HD>
<DH>Media: Investors will focus on advertising revenue and
subscriber growth at the troubled America Online unit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When AOL Time Warner Inc. releases its earnings report today, there
will be far more at stake than in the typical quarterly update.</LD>
<LD>   The media giant is struggling through a yearlong stock skid that
already has cost two executives their jobs. Investors will scrutinize
advertising revenue and subscriber growth at the troubled America
Online unit and will look for reassurance that the new management
team has answers for lingering strategic problems.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, AOL Time Warner is one of a few high-profile
companies--along with McDonald's Corp., Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc.,
GlaxoSmithKline and a few others--reporting earnings today, at a time
when the stock market is desperate for positive news.</LD>
<TE>   A key issue for Richard D. Parsons, who took over as chief
executive in May after the early retirement--under pressure--of
Gerald Levin, is reestablishing the company's credibility with
investors, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "This has become a show-me stock," said Ajay Mehra of Columbia
Management in Portland, Ore., which holds about 1 million AOL Time
Warner shares.</TE>
<TE>   Not only has the company failed to live up to the growth and
synergy promises that were the rationale for the record-breaking
merger, but it also has been accused of puffing up AOL revenue
through questionable accounting.</TE>
<TE>   The company denies wrongdoing, but the questions have helped to
pummel the stock. On the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, its
shares fell 46 cents to $11.55, a new 52-week low.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Robert W. Pittman, the corporate chief operating
officer and head of America Online, announced his resignation.
Pittman frequently was criticized for hyping the growth and profit
potential of combining Time Warner's entertainment and news brands
with America Online's Internet reach.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation has centered on Pittman's mentor, AOL Time Warner
Chairman Steve Case, as the next high-level departure, although the
company dismisses the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The single most important number in today's earnings report may be
subscriber growth at America Online, said Harold L. Vogel of Vogel
Capital in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "That will be a milestone on the way to a decision whether to keep
it [the Internet service] or get rid of it," Vogel said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>National Golf Properties Inc. said Chairman David Price agreed to
support a sale of "all or a substantial portion" of the largest
publicly traded U.S. golf course owner as part of a debt
restructuring of a related company he also controls.</LD>
<LD>   Under the restructuring, Bank of America Corp. extended American
Golf Corp.'s loan payments until March 31 and waived existing
defaults, Santa Monica-based National said. American Golf leases most
of National's properties, and Price is chairman of both firms.</LD>
<LD>   A decline in American Golf's business last year triggered a
default on both companies' debt. To solve the problems, the two
companies said they would merge.</LD>
<TE>   Charles "Skip" Paul, National Golf's interim chief executive,
didn't return calls for comment. A company spokeswoman declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of National Golf rose 7 cents to $11.51 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Sempra Energy Posts Slight Gain</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The San Diego company was helped by higher profit
at its utility units. It also reiterates its outlook for 2002 and
'03.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sempra Energy, the parent of two major California utilities, on
Tuesday reported a slight gain in second-quarter earnings despite
weaker results from its energy trading unit.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego-based company also reiterated its profit outlook for
2002 and 2003 and noted it had very little exposure to its struggling
energy trading rivals Williams Cos. and Dynegy Inc., both of which
have seen the value of their stock plunge this week.</LD>
<LD>   Sempra said it earned $147 million, or 71 cents a share, up 7.3%
from $137 million, or 66 cents, a year ago, aided by higher earnings
from utility units Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric. Revenue fell 28% to $1.37 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting earnings of 63 cents, according to
research firm Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra Energy Trading's earnings plunged 70% to $21 million, due
mainly to lower prices and reduced volatility in the U.S. natural gas
and power markets.</TE>
<TE>   The company reiterated earnings guidance given in April of $2.65 a
share for 2002 and $2.90 a share for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra Energy Resources, the company's wholesale power generation
subsidiary, reported net income of $34 million, compared with a
year-ago loss of $9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company said the improvement was primarily due to the sale of
power to the California Department of Water Resources under a 10-year
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra shares fell 95 cents to $16 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other California company earnings included:</TE>
<TE>   * Avery Dennison Corp. reported a 23% increase in second-quarter
profit to $73.8 million, or 74 cents a share, on stronger orders,
better pricing and productivity gains, but said that current economic
conditions had made it cautious about the second half of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena-based maker of adhesive products and labels said
excluding its acquisition of Germany's Jackstadt, earnings were 76
cents, beating analysts' estimates of 72 cents. Sales rose 10% to
$1.06 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Avery said it expects earnings of 68 cents to 73 cents for the
third quarter and $2.74 to $2.85 a share for the full year, excluding
acquisition-related charges.</TE>
<TE>   * California Pizza Kitchen Inc. said second-quarter earnings rose
30% to $4.3 million, or 23 cents a share, on a 25% jump in revenue to
$75.6 million. The results matched analysts' estimates that were
increased last month when the company raised its outlook.</TE>
<TE>   * Edwards Lifesciences Corp.'s second-quarter profit rose 27% to
$21.5 million, or 35 cents a share, a penny better than analysts
expected. Revenue fell 10% to $172.8 million, hurt by the divestiture
of a unit and the effect of foreign exchange.</TE>
<TE>   * 99 Cents Only Stores said second-quarter net income increased
24% to $13.5 million, or 9 cents a share, on a 23% rise in sales to
$167.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   * McKesson Corp. said fiscal first-quarter profit rose 11% to
$117.3 million, or 39 cents a share, boosted by sales of
higher-margin generic drugs and favorable purchasing terms from drug
makers. The results were a penny better than analysts' estimates.
Revenue rose 17% to $13.63 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Smart &amp; Final Inc. said earnings fell 42% to $2.1 million, or 7
cents a share, from $3.6 million, or 12 cents, on a restated basis,
as sales edged up 3% to $476 million.</TE>

<HD>Pension Provision Aimed at Cash-Balance Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Battle lines are being drawn over a one-paragraph legislative
amendment aimed at protecting worker pensions when companies convert
traditional pensions to so-called cash-balance plans.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment--tagged onto the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill
by U.S. Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.)--would keep the Internal Revenue
Service from undermining existing rules governing the calculation of
certain corporate pension benefits.</LD>
<LD>   This bill is being debated this week in the House.</LD>
<TE>   The Sanders provision--supported by the American Assn. of Retired
Persons and the Pension Rights Center--is strongly opposed by a
powerful industry group whose members include some of the biggest
companies in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment could force companies to provide more generous
benefits to early retirees, and it could help the case of thousands
of workers who have sued their companies for allegedly underpaying
pensioners.</TE>
<TE>   Cash-balance plans are hybrid pensions that look like a 401(k) but
operate more like a traditional defined-benefit plan. Companies, and
some younger workers, like the plans because they are transported
easily from one firm to the next if an employee changes jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But some older workers have sued over the plans, alleging that
some companies' efforts to convert their traditional pensions to
cash-balance plans rob longtime employees of promised benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Sanders is protecting the litigation bar's efforts to litigate
this issue," said Mark Ugoretz, president of the ERISA Industry
Council, which represents 125 large companies. "There are probably a
couple hundred of these plans in litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders said he became involved in the cash-balance pension issue
because IBM Corp. is the largest private employer in Vermont.</TE>
<TE>   When IBM converted to a cash-balance pension plan, Sanders was
inundated with calls from workers contending the company had
improperly cut their pension benefits in half.</TE>
<TE>   The IBM controversy was voluntarily resolved, largely in workers'
favor. But hundreds of other companies have converted their
traditional pensions to cash-balance plans, touching off protests
from workers.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS has not approved any conversions to cash-balance plans in
at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Department of Labor's inspector general
issued a study that said one in five cash-balance plans improperly
calculates early-retirement benefits, underpaying workers by millions
of dollars each year. Extrapolating the study sample to the hundreds
of cash-balance plans nationwide, Sanders said retirees in
cash-balance plans are being shortchanged by $85 million to $199
million each year.</TE>
<TE>   Ugoretz denies that firms have underpaid workers. However, he said
the determination of whether they did or did not probably will rest
on the maintenance of the IRS rule that Sanders wants to
legislatively protect.</TE>
<TE>   The issue boils down to this: Companies are barred by federal
pension law from taking away earned retirement benefits from workers
when they terminate or convert their pension plans. As a result,
companies must give each worker an amount equal to the "present
value" of their future pension benefits when the old pension plan is
changed.</TE>
<TE>   But that value can swing wildly based on the assumption of what
the invested money would earn in the long haul.</TE>
<TE>   Companies would like to assume relatively high returns--in the 7%
to 10% a year range. In turn, that could drastically reduce that
present value of the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS rule that Sanders wants to protect sets the assumed rate
at around 5%, which would mean a higher present value for many
retirees.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS' conservative rate assumption has been upheld in two
recent court cases, said David Certner, director of federal affairs
at AARP. But companies have been negotiating with the IRS to change
the rule, which like many IRS regulations was never made permanent.
The rule has been in place since 1996, but is still technically a
proposed rule.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders' amendment would bring those negotiations to a halt
because it would bar IRS staffers from negotiating any settlement
that changed the return assumption.</TE>

<HD>Enron Link Weighs on Banks' Shares</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Shares of Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. plunged Tuesday,
hit by investors' growing fear that the two investment banks could
face daunting legal liability over their dealings with Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The stocks plummeted amid allegations at a Senate hearing that the
banks played a central role in helping Enron disguise its troubled
finances. Citigroup shares sank $5.04, or 15.7%, to $27, and J.P.
Morgan dived $4.44, 18.1%, to $20.08. They were the most active Big
Board stocks.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most startling allegations was that Citigroup
intentionally misrepresented a 1999 transaction so Enron could
mislead investors, experts said.</LD>
<TE>   The revelations suggested that the banks did more than simply
assist Enron in managing its finances, and may have been deeply
involved in devising and constructing some of the company's allegedly
bogus financial machinations.</TE>
<TE>   That distinction is key, legal experts said, because it could
significantly heighten the banks' exposure to lawsuits from private
investors, which could be far more costly than any civil penalties
exacted by the government.</TE>
<TE>   "If the evidence bears out that the banks knowingly participated
in the deception, then the risk of civil penalties, private liability
and criminal sanctions could expose them to tens of billions of
dollars, at least, in liability," said Donald Langevoort, a
Georgetown University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   The banks vociferously defended themselves Tuesday, saying their
Enron financings were common and proper.</TE>
<TE>   Legal analysts said it is impossible at this point to gauge the
banks' responsibility, and they pointed out that it would be a
challenge for civil or criminal prosecutors to prove wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many investors chose not to wait around. Institutions have
been burned over the last year by giving the benefit of the doubt to
companies such as WorldCom Inc. when allegations of financial scandal
first surfaced, only to see the stocks eventually collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "It's emotional and people are just panicking," said Michael
Stead, who runs the Wells Fargo SIFE Specialized Financial Services
fund, which holds Citigroup shares.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts defended Enron's financing arrangements in which
loans were listed on the firm's books as commodity trades. They
noted, as the banks have said, that Enron's auditors approved the
transactions.</TE>
<TE>   As for Citigroup and J.P. Morgan, fans of the stocks said the
fundamentals are favorable. Despite a weak market for investment
banking, the economy is slowly improving and the banks' financial
stamina is much greater than during the early-1990s recession.</TE>
<TE>   "These companies are so much stronger than they ever were before,"
said Hal Schroeder, a money manager at Carlson Research &amp; Analytics
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the companies could face severe legal exposure
depending on their part in Enron's deception, others warned.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1994 ruling, the Supreme Court said lawyers and financial
advisors cannot be sued by investors for "aiding and abetting" a
stock fraud. Only those intimately involved in conceiving and
perpetuating a fraud--so-called primary violators--can be held
liable.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday's revelations about the banks "give plaintiffs'
attorneys a stronger argument that this goes beyond aiding and
abetting," said Henry Hu, a University of Texas law professor.</TE>
<TE>   The banks could face legal problems even if they're shown to have
only assisted Enron's deception: Despite the high court ruling, the
Securities and Exchange Commission still could bring civil actions
for aiding and abetting fraud, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   That would pressure the Justice Department to bring criminal
charges, either against individuals or the firms, Langevoort said.</TE>
<TE>   Any such charges could have major economic consequences because of
the role the giant banks play in financing U.S. growth. Authorities
would have to balance the need to punish wrongdoing and send a
message about deterrence with the potential economic jolt that
criminal charges would bring, Langevoort said.</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, civil or criminal charges could seriously hurt the
banks' reputations. "The bigger exposure for these institutions is if
people feel they can't invest in them or do business with them," said
Reid Ashinoff, a partner at Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal.</TE>

<HD>Clear Channel Shift Sparks Stock Sell-Off</HD>
<DH>Broadcasting: Media giant's shares drop 16.5% after it
announces that chief of radio division is stepping down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clear Channel Communications Inc. on Tuesday tried to ease concerns
about its performance after the abrupt shift of its top radio
division executive to a lower-profile post, but investors seemed
unconvinced.</LD>
<LD>   Although the company announced that its second-quarter earnings
would beat projections, Clear Channel shares fell 16.5% to $25, down
$4.94, on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   The sell-off followed the surprise announcement late Monday that
Randy Michaels, the colorful and controversial chief of Clear
Channel's sprawling 1,200-station radio operation, would step down to
head a new internal think tank focusing on broadband and satellite
technology. Company President Mark Mays is stepping in as acting
chief of the radio division.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said Michaels' exit--coupled with a series of regulatory
and legal issues swirling around the radio giant--underscored doubts
about Clear Channel's strategy, notwithstanding the revised earnings
projection. To further allay investor concerns, Clear Channel said it
was moving up the release of its second-quarter earnings from July 31
to today.</TE>
<TE>   The San Antonio media conglomerate said it would better its
earlier forecast of $600 million to $615 million in EBITDA, or
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the
preferred financial measure for media companies.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said
Michaels "is a very capable radio executive and [we] view his
departure as a negative. What's more, while Mark Mays has experience
running the radio division, we find it odd that the company did not
have a replacement for Mr. Michaels in place."</TE>
<TE>   Criticism about anti-competitive business practices and
questionable deals with independent record promoters have been "a
distraction that could take away from the primary job of managing
this large complement of radio stations," said James Goss, an analyst
with Barrington Research. "I don't think [Michaels' exit] necessarily
takes everything away. They have plenty of upside potential if they
can improve the profitability of their properties. But they need to
figure out a strategy that will best enable them to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel hopes to generate additional profit by selling
advertising across its "platform" of assets acquired in a series of
multibillion-dollar deals. In addition to radio stations, these
include about 135 concert venues and an estimated 700,000 billboards
and outdoor ad spaces.</TE>
<TE>   But advertising experts say the company hasn't delivered.</TE>
<TE>   "Their cross-platform stuff has not come to fruition," said Matt
Feinberg, a senior vice president overseeing radio for ad-placement
giant Zenith Media.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel officials said Michaels decided to leave the radio
post Monday after a conversation with Mays. The company said
Michaels' replacement will be based in San Antonio, not the
Covington, Ky., headquarters of the radio division.</TE>
<TE>   Widely known within the industry for his aggressive management
style and sometimes brusque remarks, Michaels often seemed out of
place working for staid company founder Lowry Mays and his family.</TE>
<TE>   One music executive who frequently interacts with the company
recalled that Michaels appeared at a radio convention being carried
in on a throne. At another industry event this year, Michaels showed
up dressed as a disco-era deejay and chastised radio and record
executives for clinging to 1970s-era business philosophies.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see that as the image the Mays family wants to project,"
the executive said. "You've got oil and water there."</TE>

<HD>Dollar Rallies Against Euro, Yen as Gold Shows Weakness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dollar resurged Tuesday and gold tumbled, both hinting that fear
levels on Wall Street may be about to recede.</LD>
<LD>   The dollar scored its biggest one-day gain in 10 months against
the euro, with the latter ending in New York at 98.9 cents, down from
$1.01 on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The greenback also rallied against the yen, closing at 117.54 yen,
versus 116.35 Monday.</LD>
<TE>   In commodities trading, near-term gold futures plunged $10.90 to
$312.70 an ounce in New York. It was the biggest one-day drop for the
metal in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Currency traders said the dollar's rebound may signal that U.S.
portfolio managers are selling foreign holdings and bringing their
dollars home.</TE>
<TE>   The euro's sudden weakness also may reflect that European stock
markets have been performing as bad, or worse, lately than Wall
Street, at least measured in euro terms.</TE>
<TE>   "Other markets around the world are also taking their lumps," said
Alex Beuzelin, a currency analyst at Ruesch International in
Washington. "Selling the dollar is no longer the one-way bet it's
been the past few months."</TE>
<TE>   Demand picked up for the dollar as analysts said some investors
took off bets they had made that the currency would keep falling.
Some hedge funds started paring those bets after the dollar gained in
New York trading on Friday even as U.S. stocks tumbled, said Bob
Sinche, head currency strategist at Citibank.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided to move some assets back" to the U.S. because of a
slump in European shares and after the tumble in the dollar in recent
weeks, said David Rossmiller, who oversees $3 billion as head of
global fixed income at Deutsche Bank Private Banking. He said the
bank sold some of its European share holdings Tuesday and bought U.S.
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, meanwhile, fell in part on expectations that a strengthening
dollar will reduce gold demand from jewelry manufacturers and
investors in Europe and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "Gold looks weak on all fronts," said Tony Roggina, a gold trader
at VIT Trading Inc. in New York. "If the dollar continues to climb,
gold will continue to adjust to that."</TE>
<TE>   Gold had climbed to a 2 1/2-year high in early June, reaching
nearly $328 an ounce, as a weakening dollar made the metal cheaper
for buyers using other currencies, and as some investors fled stocks
for perceived safer havens.</TE>
<TE>   But gold has traded mostly in a narrow range of $310 to $325 since
late May, unable to get much traction despite the continuing plunge
in the stock market.</TE>

<HD>Profit Falls at Bristol-Myers, Rises at Pharmacia, Wyeth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said Tuesday that its quarterly profit
plunged as overstocked wholesalers cut orders and doctors switched
patients to generic drugs. Profit rose at two other pharmaceutical
companies, Pharmacia Corp. and Wyeth.</LD>
<LD>   Bristol-Myers, the world's fifth-largest drug maker, said net
income fell 63% in the second quarter and profit would be lower than
forecast through 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Pharmacia's net grew 23% on a payment for rights to Ambien, a
sleeping pill. Wyeth's net rose 26% on sales of depression and
heartburn drugs.</LD>
<TE>   The gulf between drug makers with good prospects and those with
weaker pipelines is widening, said John Borzilleri, fund manager with
State Street Research.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers follows Merck &amp; Co. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. in reporting
lower profits after losing patent protection on top-selling products.
Patents held by Pharmacia and Wyeth have years to run.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers' net income fell to $440 million, or 23 cents a
share, from $1.2 billion, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell 14%
to $4.05 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of the Glucophage diabetes drug, the Taxol cancer medication
and the Buspar anxiety treatment plunged 93% to $51 million after
Bristol-Myers lost exclusive rights, opening the market to cheaper
generics.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers' results for the quarter were short of the 26-cent
average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers shares fell 70 cents to $21.10 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacia, which last week agreed to be bought by No. 1 drug maker
Pfizer Inc., said net income in the second quarter rose to $907
million, or 69 cents a share, from $737 million, or 55 cents, a year
earlier. Sales rose 4.1% to $3.55 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacia received $424 million for U.S. rights to Ambien from
French partner Sanofi Synthelabo, contributing 32 cents a share to
the quarterly results.</TE>
<TE>   Combined worldwide sales of Pharmacia's Celebrex painkiller and
its successor, Bextra, were $896 million in the quarter, up 26% from
Celebrex's sales alone a year earlier. Bextra's sales, in the drug's
first quarter on the market, were $89 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Peapack, N.J.-based Pharmacia fell 39 cents to $36.01 on
the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Net income at Madison, N.J.-based Wyeth, formerly known as
American Home Products Corp., rose to $599.9 million, or 45 cents a
share, from $477 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose
10% to $3.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth is evaluating how much sales of its Premarin line of hormone
replacement products may decline after researchers earlier this month
said that they halted a study of one of the hormone drugs, Prempro,
because it may raise patients' risk of breast cancer and heart
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth said it won't issue a profit forecast yet because it can't
estimate sales of the medicines.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of the Effexor antidepressant rose 70% to $604.2 million,
and sales of the Premarin line of products, including Prempro, gained
4% to $445.4 million. Sales of the Protonix heartburn medicine rose
45% to $192.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth shares rose 91 cents to $31 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Senators Berate Enron Bankers</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Financial institutions' dealings with the fallen
energy trader are called 'shameful.' Citigroup and J.P. Morgan
executives defend their actions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers skewered bankers from J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup
Inc. on Tuesday, saying their actions to help Enron Corp. disguise
more than $8 billion in debt demonstrate why investors are losing
faith in Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   "This is shameful," said Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), who chairs the
Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations. At a hearing, Levin
repeatedly confronted the bankers with e-mails and tape recordings he
said contradicted their statements that they did nothing wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the ranking Republican on the
committee, said it "appears as though [J.P. Morgan and Citigroup]
were willing to risk their reputations to keep Enron, an important
client, happy."</LD>
<TE>   The committee has been focusing on the banks' efforts to help
Enron raise more than $8 billion over six years by arranging
so-called prepaid contracts with special-purpose entities based
offshore.</TE>
<TE>   Senate investigators say the prepaid contracts, ostensibly for
future energy trades, were in fact loans. Cloaking these loans as
prepaid contracts inflated Enron's cash flow and reduced the debt on
its balance sheet, presenting an inaccurate picture of the energy
trader's financial health.</TE>
<TE>   "It became a merry-go-round," said Robert L. Roach, the
committee's chief investigator, who said Enron was using money
provided from new prepaid deals to repay previous ones. At the time
of Enron's bankruptcy, it had nearly $5 billion worth of the prepaid
deals outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   The banks vigorously defended their actions, claiming that the
deals they set up were legal and widely used by other companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Prepaid forward contracts have been used for many years and are
widely recognized as an entirely proper tool to enable businesses to
increase their liquidity and diversify their sources of funding,"
said Jeffrey Dellapina, a managing director at J.P. Morgan Chase.</TE>
<TE>   Both banks denied that the contracts were an attempt to disguise
loans, saying the deals were ultimately reported as liabilities. And
both attempted to shift the blame to Enron, which they said initiated
the transactions and was responsible for selecting the proper
accounting method. "While we regret our relationship with Enron, we
acted in good faith at all times," said David Bushnell, a Citigroup
managing director.</TE>
<TE>   But Levin, using the banks' internal e-mails, documents and taped
conference calls, attempted to blow holes in their assertions that
they were unaware the deals were being abused or improperly
structured. At one point, the questioning of Chase became so heated
that the bank's attorneys--which included Valerie Caproni, former
director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's West Coast
region--scrambled out to the hallway to strategize.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, Chase executives seemed surprised and unfamiliar with
their own internal documents. An impatient and incredulous Levin
threatened to call Chase's top executives to appear before his
committee if the company failed to follow up in writing with answers
to his questions.</TE>
<TE>   Levin pointed to one 1998 e-mail that he said demonstrated Chase
knew the deals were being used to deceive investors.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron loves these deals as they are able to hide funded debt from
their equity analysts because they (at the very least) book it as
deferred revenue or (better yet) bury it in their trading
liabilities," wrote a Chase employee working on the deals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exactly what happened," Levin said. "And Chase knew it. If I
were Chase, I'd be embarrassed by that e-mail."</TE>
<TE>   Chase executives said they found nothing embarrassing about the
e-mail but suggested that the employee who wrote it misunderstood the
deals. Levin asked Robert W. Traband, a Chase vice president who
worked on the deals, whether it would be accurate to describe the
prepaid contracts as "circular deals" because the money is simply
transferred among the parties back to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Traband said he did not believe the term would be fair. Then Levin
played a tape recording of a meeting, recorded by Chase in the normal
course of business, in which Traband states, "This is a circular deal
that goes right back to them."</TE>
<TE>   Later Levin spent more than an hour attacking Chase's claim that a
special-purpose entity set up to act as a go-between for Chase and
Enron was an independent third party. The issue of independence is
critical because if the entity were owned by Chase, the deals might
not be legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   Levin produced documents showing that the entity, known as
Mahonia, was created by an attorney working for Chase; that its
administrative and legal fees were paid by Chase; that it took
instructions from Chase and did business with no other company; and
that Chase employees discussed steps needed to "make sure that
Mahonia seems independent."</TE>
<TE>   But Chase Managing Directors Dellapina and Donald H. McCree stood
by their assertion that Mahonia was an independent entity owned by a
charitable trust.</TE>
<TE>   When Citigroup executives testified, Levin attacked their claim
that there was no attempt to conceal the deals and that financing was
adequately disclosed to investors.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have nothing to hide, why do this in a secrecy
jurisdiction," Levin asked, referring to the Cayman Islands entity
set up by Citigroup to handle the deals. "Why not do it in daylight?"</TE>
<TE>   Richard Caplan, another Citigroup managing director, said the
Cayman Islands offered certain tax advantages.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether Enron's accounting of the deals will turn out
to be illegal. If it does, the banks might face liability for aiding
and abetting the failed energy trader, lawmakers said. The SEC is
investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Turner, former chief accountant for the SEC, said it appears
that the banks willfully attempted to avoid disclosing details about
the contracts. He predicted that SEC investigators would be troubled
by the deals.</TE>
<TE>   He also criticized Citigroup for attempting to reduce its own
exposure to the deals by selling stakes to outside investors.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recording industry came under attack for accounting practices
that, according to artists, routinely underreport royalties, cheating
them out of millions of dollars. The allegations were made during a
state Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Among those addressing the committee was Los Angeles music
attorney Don Engel, who estimated that record companies routinely
"underpay 10% to 40% on every royalty" and dare artists to challenge
it without committing "artistic suicide."</LD>
<LD>   Record industry spokesmen and attorneys denied the allegations.
The industry also released an economic analysis of its record
contracts, noting that fewer than 5% of signed artists produce a hit
record. Likewise, for every hit the industry has, it loses $6.3
million on albums that bomb, it said.</LD>
<TE>   The hearing comes as record executives fight a bill by state Sen.
Kevin Murray (D-Culver City) to rein in a record industry practice
that binds singers to long-term contracts lasting through much of
their careers.</TE>

<HD>Patients Caught in Dispute Between HMO, Hospitals</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Some Medi-Cal enrollees have access problems
because of a contract battle between Health Net and Tenet Healthcare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Romina Cabrera did not know why, all of a sudden, she could not take
her new baby to see his pediatrician.</LD>
<LD>   Christian was born four months prematurely, on March 26, and
released from a Van Nuys hospital 55 days later. As a child of a
mother on Medi-Cal, which serves the state's poor and disabled,
Christian was referred to a nearby pediatrician. Christian got good
care with his new doctor, Cabrera said, but earlier this month
Cabrera was told that the doctor no longer could see Christian.</LD>
<LD>   "My heart sank; I didn't know where to go," said Cabrera, 24.</LD>
<TE>   Cabrera's problem wasn't that the pediatrician, Dr. Pejman
Salimpour, did not want to see her son. Rather, Health Net Inc., the
insurance company through which Christian receives Medi-Cal coverage,
this month halted all new Medi-Cal enrollment at 10 hospitals and
about 20 doctors' groups owned by or affiliated with Tenet Healthcare
Corp., the state's largest hospital operator.</TE>
<TE>   Health Net took the action because it has been locked in a
protracted contract battle with Tenet over hospital reimbursement
rates. Their yearlong dispute reflects the heightened tensions
between hospitals and health plans as they try to preserve profits
and gain market leverage at a time when health insurance premiums are
soaring. Medi-Cal has been a growing and important business for both
Health Net and Tenet as well as some other HMOs and hospital
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Just how many new Medi-Cal enrollees have been inconvenienced or
more seriously affected by Health Net's freeze is unclear. Regulators
at the California Department of Managed Health Care, which oversees
HMOs, said they were looking into the matter but so far have not
received complaints from Medi-Cal members.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Health Net, which reported more than 577,000 Medi-Cal
members at the end of last year, said they took the action to reduce
the risk of patient disruption if negotiations broke down and
resulted in termination of contracts.</TE>
<TE>   But health professionals and consumer advocates say that whatever
the intent, some patients such as Christian are getting caught in the
middle of two health-care industry giants.</TE>
<TE>   Christian's case illustrates that Tenet and Health Net "are
playing hardball with each other, thinking they are not harming
patients, when in fact they are," said Lucien Wulsin, director of the
Insure the Uninsured Project, a nonprofit group in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Ciano, general manager of Health Net's Southern
California operations, said that as a result of the contract dispute,
Health Net also halted new enrollment for private insurance members
at three other Tenet-affiliated medical groups, which he would not
identify.</TE>
<TE>   Ciano said that even with the freeze, Health Net's new Medi-Cal
members and others can choose from other doctors and hospitals. Ciano
said the freeze affects only 10% of the hospitals and about 12% of
the primary care physicians in Health Net's network.</TE>
<TE>   But in certain areas, such as Inglewood, Tenet has a dominant
market share. And health professionals said the loss of access to
some hospitals and medical groups could make things tough for
Medi-Cal patients, who are the least likely to have transportation to
see doctors farther away.</TE>
<TE>   In some instances, it is more serious. Under California's complex
public insurance program, Christian, for example, was covered to see
any doctor on a fee-for-service basis for up to two months after his
release from the hospital. During that time, he was seen by Salimpour
more than a dozen times.</TE>
<TE>   But when Christian's mother and then later Salimpour's office
tried to sign up Christian for continued care under Medi-Cal, Health
Net said he could not be enrolled with Salimpour because of the
freeze. So Christian's mother took her baby to another Health Net-
approved pediatrician farther away, but she said that doctor's group
told her it did not have the ability to write a referral for
Christian to see a specialist. That's when Salimpour intervened,
complaining to senior Health Net executives, who have assured him
that Christian will have access to him.</TE>
<TE>   "But what about all the other families?" said Salimpour, an
associate professor of clinical pediatrics at UCLA. Salimpour said 20
other current and prospective patients have complained to him. Health
Net and Tenet, he said, "should keep their disputes in the corporate
boardroom and leave patients out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Health Net said the current enrollment freeze should not separate
families or new dependents, and that members should call if that has
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Fisher, deputy director at the state Department of Managed
Health Care, said the agency would investigate whether Health Net's
freeze has disrupted care and whether new enrollees have reasonable
access to providers, as is guaranteed under the patients rights law.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher and Stan Rosenstein, Department of Health Services
assistant deputy director of medical care services, both said their
agencies would ensure that Health Net's provider directory reflects
any changes, so that prospective Medi-Cal members do not sign up with
the HMO thinking they have access to certain doctors or hospitals
that have been frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Health Net and Tenet said they have served
termination notices to each other at several facilities, although
none would take effect until later this year. Health Net officials
said Tenet was demanding unreasonable reimbursement rates, in some
cases two to three times those of competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Anderson, a spokesman at Tenet, which operates more than two
dozen hospitals in Southern California, said the company's offer was
fair. Neither side would provide further details.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. hired investment bank Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. for financial advice two weeks after it said second-quarter
earnings were more than 50% below forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Costa Mesa-based drug maker fell 77 cents, or 8.3%,
to $8.49 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   The stock, which is down 75% so far this year, reached a
seven-year low of $8.25 earlier in the day.</LD>
<TE>   ICN makes the hepatitis drug ribavirin, as well as antibiotics,
sedatives and vitamins.</TE>
<TE>   "Goldman Sachs has been hired to do a full review" of the
company's finances, said Alan Charles, ICN's executive vice president
for investor relations.</TE>
<TE>   He said ICN is not for sale and declined to comment further until
his company makes a formal announcement about hiring the investment
bank.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Rachman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   ICN shares plunged 52%, their steepest drop, on July 11 after
Chief Executive Robert O'Leary said quarterly profit would come in
well below analysts' forecasts because of bloated product inventories
at several distributors.</TE>
<TE>   O'Leary became CEO and chairman of ICN last month after founder
and Chairman Milan Panic lost a proxy fight with dissident
shareholders. O'Leary was one of three new directors elected to the
board.</TE>
<TE>   In December, ICN agreed to plead guilty to a criminal securities
fraud charge and pay a $5.6-million penalty for waiting four months
in 1994 to tell investors that the Food and Drug Administration had
determined that doctors wouldn't be able to use ribavirin alone to
treat liver disease.</TE>

<HD>Trading Is Heavy as the Flight from Stocks Continues</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: As S&amp;P index falls 2.7%, one indicator shows
investor fear at levels last seen in 1987--another possible sign of a
bottom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks slumped Tuesday in another wild session, as a key measure of
the market's fear level soared to heights last seen during the crash
of 1987.</LD>
<LD>   After several rally attempts collapsed, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index ended with a loss of 22.15 points, or 2.7%, at 797.70, leaving
the blue-chip index about 10 points away from marking the worst
bear-market percentage decline since the Great Depression.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average lost 82.24 points, or 1.1%, to
7,702.34. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 53.60 points, or 4.2%,
to 1,229.05 as tech stocks helped pace the day's decline.</LD>
<TE>   Breadth was abysmal, as losers swamped winners by more than 4 to 1
on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than 3 to 1 on Nasdaq.
Trading volume was heavy, with the NYSE recording its third-busiest
day ever.</TE>
<TE>   Once again there were few places to hide as investors dumped
stocks across all size ranges and most industry sectors: The mid-cap
S&amp;P 400 and the Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks fell through
their September lows, losing 3% and 4.1%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The widely watched VIX, an index that measures expected volatility
in S&amp;P 100 "put" and "call" options traded on the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, soared to 50.5, topping the closing peak of 49.04
reached after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other measures of market sentiment, the VIX appears to
be indicating that the 28-month-long bear market is nearing an end,
some say: Bear markets usually bottom when fear levels are highest.</TE>
<TE>   Yet several technical analysts said this week's VIX spike is far
from a convincing sign of a market bottom. There is still too much
investor complacency for their contrarian tastes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an eyebrow-raiser and it's something to watch, but it's not
a 'Eureka!' '' said John McGinley, editor of Technical Trends
newsletter in Wilton, Conn. "Psychologically speaking, we've got to
get to the point where people are saying they would never invest
again. We've got to completely wash out the bull case."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Johnson, analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in
Cincinnati, agreed: "So far the VIX is bullish fodder that may bring
in some buyers, particularly if we see higher spikes in the next few
days. But it doesn't represent exhaustion of the selling."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Rabbitt, portfolio manager at Rabbitt Capital in Hermosa
Beach, said that although previous VIX spikes have marked at least
near-term bottoms, corporate accounting scandals have created a
different climate in this sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is waiting for the other shoes to drop," Rabbitt said,
noting the Aug. 14 deadline for executives of the nation's largest
companies to certify the accuracy of their firms' financial
statements in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally we'd see a market turn at a time like this, but I
believe the weakness could stretch on for weeks because of the
uncertainty," Rabbitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said that for the market to reach a solid bottom, "we may
have to see a violent down day that just shakes investors out of the
tree. People have grown so accustomed to 2% losses, I think it might
be better for the market if you had a 10% drop."</TE>
<TE>   But others note that, precisely because many investors would be
happy to see a one-day crash if it meant the bottom would finally be
reached, the market is unlikely to be so accommodating.</TE>
<TE>   From a more fundamental perspective, Rabbitt said stock mutual
fund redemptions--believed to be accelerating for the second straight
month, as more individual investors flee--could be "a dragon in a
cave, waiting to come out" and further torture the market.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * At the day's closing value, the S&amp;P 500 is down 47.8% from its
March 2000 peak. If the decline extends beyond 48.4%, it will exceed
the 1973-74 bear market loss.</TE>
<TE>   * Among blue chips, General Electric fell 86 cents to $24.80 after
saying it would cut 2,500 jobs at its power systems unit, citing
slowing sales of large turbines.</TE>
<TE>   * Sharp declines in J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, which are being
investigated for their Enron dealings, also hurt the major indexes.
J.P. Morgan dropped $4.44 to $20.08 and Citigroup slid $5.04 to $27.</TE>
<TE>   * Microsoft led major tech stocks lower, falling $3.30 to $43.01.
Intel lost 45 cents to $17.81, EBay dropped $2.89 to $53.16 and Cisco
Systems fell 48 cents to $12.50.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Novellus Systems lost $2.80 to $26.75 after trimming profit
forecasts for the current quarter. Among other tech names, PMC-Sierra
fell $1.06 to $9.11, USA Interactive sagged $2.55 to $18.16 and BEA
Systems dropped 81 cents to $5.67. Comcast fell $2.65 to $18.40 as
cable stocks slumped.</TE>
<TE>   * Several consumer-products stocks bucked the trend, responding
positively to second-quarter earnings news. 3M rallied $2.76 to
$111.76, Gillette climbed $1.91 to $30.91, Colgate-Palmolive gained
$1.89 to $47.20, Black &amp; Decker jumped $3.54 to $40.37, and
Kimberly-Clark added $3.01 to $56.01.</TE>
<TE>   * Home builders rallied after Pulte Homes beat second-quarter
profit forecasts. Pulte rose $2.97 to $43.79, KB Home gained $2.17 to
$42.55 and Toll Bros. added $1 to $22.04.</TE>
<TE>   * Overseas, stocks fell in Europe and Latin America but rose
modestly in Asia. Leading indexes lost 4.8% in Germany, 2.5% in
France, 1% in Britain, 1.5% in Brazil and 3.6% in Mexico. But Japan's
Nikkei 225 gained 0.3%.</TE>
<TE>   A plunge in shares of many power companies hammered the junk-bond
market, driving bond prices lower.</TE>

<HD>PacBell Is on Road to Long-Distance Service</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The local phone carrier is given tentative
approval to enter the market in California. A PUC vote is expected as
early as Aug. 22.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Pacific Bell, the state's largest local phone company, won
tentative approval Tuesday to sell long-distance service in
California, a move that would radically alter the state's massive
telecommunications market and strike another blow to crippled
long-distance companies such as WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   But the landmark ruling by an administrative law judge contained a
host of conditions on how SBC PacBell can enter the long-distance
business, noting in harsh language the company's anti-competitive
behavior in selling high-speed Internet services.</LD>
<LD>   SBC PacBell praised the ruling and said it would work with the
Public Utilities Commission to address the judge's criticisms. But
consumer advocates and rival phone companies questioned whether the
commission should endorse the move.</LD>
<TE>   The judge is saying "we find that you have acted in an
anti-competitive way, but we think you should be deregulated anyway,"
said Ken McNeely, president of rival AT&amp;T California.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling will go to the five-member commission for a vote as
early as Aug. 22. SBC PacBell said it then would proceed to the
Federal Communications Commission for approval. It expects to be
selling long-distance throughout California by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   At least one commissioner, Geoffrey Brown, believes the company is
"more than ready" to sell long-distance service in California.</TE>
<TE>   Administrative Law Judge Jacqueline Reed ruled that SBC PacBell
must separate its long-distance marketing from its local phone
service marketing and that the company should study the option of
dividing the two businesses into separate companies.</TE>
<TE>   Lora Watts, president of external affairs for SBC PacBell, praised
the judge's ruling, saying, "It gives us a thumbs up to move
forward." Of the critical language and concern about meeting state
law, "there is nothing there that provides any concern to us," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, PacBell has been barred
from selling long-distance service in its home market until it proves
it has sufficiently opened its monopoly local phone service
territories to competitors. In a separate state law, regulators must
find that the move is in the public interest and that there are no
anti-competitive behavior and no unfair use of local customer data.
Reed found that the firm did not meet those requirements, leaving
open whether the commission can ignore state law and approve the
application.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell, owned by San Antonio-based SBC Communications Inc.,
controls 95% of California's residential phone market, with more than
7.8 million customers. Its strength in the local market is expected
to quickly translate into a leading market share in California's
long-distance market as well.</TE>
<TE>   The company contends that its ability to offer long-distance would
be a boon to consumers, who would get more choices, better deals on
packages of local and long-distance service, and the convenience of
one phone bill and one-stop shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Sayers, an independent expert on long-distance service, said
that's only partly true. Judging by results in other states, SBC
PacBell's long-distance offering is likely to have only moderate
prices compared to other companies.</TE>
<TE>   But customers may save money anyway, he said, because many signed
up for higher-priced plans and don't have time to shop around.
Because SBC PacBell "owns the envelope" for the local phone bill, the
long-distance offers are likely to catch the attention of busy
consumers and win their business with relatively lower prices and the
ease of switching.</TE>
<TE>   Critics believe any savings on long-distance would be outstripped
by the company's pricing on its local services, where SBC PacBell has
little residential competition.</TE>
<TE>   Even Judge Reed appeared to have doubts.</TE>
<TE>   Despite concluding that SBC PacBell has won the right to move into
long-distance, Reed said the company doesn't meet some requirements
because it "has erected unreasonable barriers to entry" into
California's critical and lucrative market for high-speed Internet
access over phone lines, a service known as digital subscriber line.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a group of California Internet service providers filed
a complaint with state regulators charging that SBC PacBell had
control of the DSL market and that the ISPs were being forced to sign
overly restrictive contracts with the phone company.</TE>
<TE>   "California's independent Internet service providers have been
ravaged by Pacific Bell's anti-competitive behavior," said David
Simpson, founder of the California Internet Service Providers Assn.
"It is simply naive to think that Pacific Bell will not leverage
their local monopoly in abusive and anti-competitive ways once [it
has] access to this vast and lucrative long-distance market."</TE>
<TE>   In the last 10 months, SBC PacBell has been fined more than $52
million for sales and marketing abuses in the residential phone and
the DSL markets.</TE>
<TE>   One investigation uncovered a boiler room-like atmosphere at SBC
PacBell, where service representatives were offered sales incentives
and urged on by management fliers that read, "Offer high, watch 'em
buy; offer low, nowhere to go."</TE>
<TE>   "Pacific is notorious for using its local monopoly to pressure its
captive customers to buy additional services," said Regina Costa, of
the consumer group the Utility Reform Network. "Its entry into the
long-distance business could subject consumers to the biggest
hard-sell by PacBell in history."</TE>
<TE>   The most successful local competitors in California have been the
cable telephony operations of Cox Communications Inc. and AT&amp;T
Broadband, which have signed up several hundred thousand Californians
for local phone service.</TE>

<DH>Earnings: Lucent plans job cuts as losses mount. AT&amp;T's
loss widens, and SBC's profit falls 11%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grim earnings reports Tuesday from three major telecommunications
companies suggest that the industry, already battered by the
bankruptcy filing of WorldCom Inc., will continue its slide as
overcapacity, cutthroat competition and a difficult economy dash
hopes for a recovery this year.</LD>
<LD>   Lucent Technologies Inc., the nation's largest telephone equipment
maker, reported a loss of $7.84 billion for its fiscal third quarter
and announced it would slash 7,000 more jobs by year's end.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, SBC Communications Inc. sliced 3,000 jobs as
second-quarter profit fell 11% to $1.85 billion. And AT&amp;T Corp.
posted a record $12.7-billion loss, largely because of a
$13.1-billion write-off in the value of its cable business and a 22%
decline in consumer long-distance sales.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of all three companies swooned on the New York Stock
Exchange, with AT&amp;T and SBC hitting 52-week lows. AT&amp;T fell 72 cents,
or 8%, to $8.80. SBC, the parent company of Pacific Bell, lost 66
cents, or 3%, to close at $23.30.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent sank 45 cents, or 21%, to $1.65.</TE>
<TE>   "You sit back and it's like watching a car wreck," said David
Barden, a telecommunications analyst with Banc of America Securities.
"It's amazing and spooky. We're learning that it's impossible to make
assumptions that last much longer than a quarter in this industry."</TE>
<TE>   One measure of how far things have deteriorated is the fortunes of
Lucent. The once-admired company reported its ninth straight
quarterly loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Murray Hill, N.J., company lost $7.84 billion from continuing
operations, or $2.30 a share, in its third quarter ended June 30,
significantly wider than a year-earlier loss of $1.88 billion, or 55
cents a share. Including discontinued businesses and payouts of
preferred dividends, Lucent's loss was $7.91 billion, or $2.31 a
share, compared with a $3.24-billion net loss, or 95 cents a share, a
year earlier. The latest loss included a $5.8-billion noncash charge
to write down the value of its tax write-offs.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue sank to $2.95 billion, down 45% from $5.37 billion, as
telephone carriers continued sharp cuts on capital spending.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the year, Lucent expects to have 45,000 employees.
At its peak in July 2000, it had 155,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucent was one of the leaders on the way up, and now it's leading
the way down," said Michael Cristinziano, an analyst with Gerard
Klauer Mattison, which does not own shares in Lucent and has not
provided banking services to the company. "That said, the industry is
not dead. It's just hung over, and it's going to take some time to
recover."</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T, meanwhile, presented mixed earnings. Although its
long-distance business performed better than Wall Street expected,
the New York company's cable business did worse, signing up fewer new
subscribers than anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest long-distance carrier posted a second-quarter
loss of $12.7 billion, or $3.49 a share, primarily due to a
$13.1-billion erosion in the value of its cable business, which AT&amp;T
is selling to Comcast Corp. for $52 billion. The loss compares with a
year-earlier loss of $191 million, or 10 cents a share. Excluding the
noncash charges, AT&amp;T's operating earnings were $3.36 billion, or 7
cents a share, down 13% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Sales fell less steeply than analysts had anticipated, dropping
6.2% from a year earlier to $12.1 billion. Consumer long-distance
revenue dropped 22% to $2.91 billion, while business revenue declined
3.8% to $6.74 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers aren't fantastic, but the operating results weren't
bad at all," said Kevin Calabrese, a telecommunications analyst with
Argus Research in New York. "It's starting to come up from the
bottom."</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc., meanwhile, posted a profit of $19
million, or 1 cent a share. The third-largest wireless phone company
earned $229 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier, including a
$298-million one-time gain from the sale of investments. Sales jumped
16% to $3.91 billion.</TE>
<TE>   SBC, the nation's second-largest local phone company, also
reported a drop in sales and profit. The San Antonio firm's net
income fell 11% to $1.85 billion, or 55 cents a share, from $2.07
billion, or 61 cents a share, last year. Revenue of $13.1 billion was
down 4% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   One bright spot for SBC was a preliminary approval by California
regulators Tuesday to let PacBell enter the long-distance phone
market.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, SBC said it will slash 3,000 jobs, or about 2% of its
work force. "My sense is that they will cut even more jobs," said
Alex Mou, an analyst with Hotovec Pomeranz &amp; Co., which does not own
SBC stock.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two biggest buyers of U.S. home
mortgages, have decided to treat stock options as an expense to make
their income statements more clear.</LD>
<LD>   Options granted after Dec. 31, 2001, are being accounted for as a
compensation cost, Freddie Mac said. In the second quarter, that
expense was less than $4 million.</LD>
<LD>   Fannie Mae will begin expensing in the next grant cycle, pending
approval by its board.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, Freddie Mac said second-quarter profit rose as low
interest rates cut borrowing costs and helped it weather a slowdown
in growth of its mortgage assets.</TE>
<TE>   Operating earnings rose 26% to $968 million, or $1.30 a share, 8

<LD>The bitter battle over Morton's Restaurant Group Inc. ended when
shareholders accepted Castle Harlan Inc.'s offer to acquire the
company, snubbing an offer from billionaire financier Carl Icahn.</LD>
<LD>   The Morton's board agreed last week to accept Castle Harlan's
sweetened offer after the private New York buyout firm matched a bid
of $71.2 million from a group led by Icahn.</LD>
<LD>   Castle Harlan increased its bid four times because of bids by
Icahn.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co.'s NBC television network is speeding up plans to
make a movie about the life of Martha Stewart, the homemaking
celebrity whose stock trading is under investigation by Congress.</LD>
<LD>   "We had not intended to do this for the upcoming season, but in
light of recent events, [we] decided it might be an opportune time to
put it into quick production," said Jeff Zucker, NBC Entertainment's
president.</LD>
<LD>   A House committee is looking into whether Stewart sold shares of
ImClone Systems Inc. based on a tip from Samuel Waksal, the drug
maker's former chief executive and a friend of Stewart's. Stewart,
the CEO of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., has denied
wrongdoing. The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Tuesday asked
for additional records of ImClone trades handled by Merrill Lynch
brokers and their assistants at the company's Roseland, N.J., office.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co., which plan to merge this
year, reported second-quarter profit declines after oil and natural
gas prices dropped.</LD>
<LD>   Conoco's net income fell 76% to $130 million, or 20 cents a share,
from a year earlier after the company lost money making and selling
fuels in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Phillips' earnings dropped 43% to $351 million, or 91 cents,
partly because oil and gas production decreased 2.9%.</LD>
<TE>   Phillips had a first-quarter loss after losing $88 million from
refining and selling fuel, and Conoco's profit fell for the fourth
quarter in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Houston-based Conoco fell 54 cents to $21.36, and
Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., declined 66 cents to $45.74,

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge refused to dismiss a sexual harassment lawsuit
against Dial Corp., clearing the way for a trial within the next few
months, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   Dial, maker of its namesake bar soap and Purex laundry detergent,
is facing a trial on an EEOC lawsuit filed on behalf of almost 100
current and former employees at the company's facility in Aurora,
Ill. The EEOC said it's the biggest sexual harassment case brought by
the government agency since one against Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Dial tried to have the suit dismissed last year. When that effort
failed, the company appealed the decision and again lost, the EEOC
said.</LD>
<TE>   Dial spokesman Tom Herrmann said the company had not seen the
ruling and could not comment. Shares of Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Dial
rose 52 cents to $18.50 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Federal regulators restarted a review of the proposed $26-billion
merger between satellite television company EchoStar Communications
Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar, which offers Dish Network, and
Hughes, the parent of DirecTV, are seeking government approval for a
merger that would create the largest pay-TV service in the country.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission in March halted a review of
whether the merger would hurt competition in the industry. The FCC
said it needed more financial records to proceed. The agency said
Tuesday the companies had provided the records and the review is
scheduled to be completed in about 100 days.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Hughes said the company is confident the deal will
be closed by year end.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies have said the merger would expand high-speed
Internet access for rural residents, whose high-speed access lags
behind urban areas.</TE>

<HD>Discounts Cut Amazon Losses Nearly in Half</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The online retailer will treat stock options as
expenses. Corning says its quarterly loss narrowed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Losses at Amazon.com Inc. were cut nearly in half in the second
quarter as the online retailer cut prices and offered shipping
discounts to lure new customers and boost sales.</LD>
<LD>   The Seattle-based company said Tuesday that it lost $94 million,
or 25 cents a share, down significantly from its loss of $168
million, or 47 cents a share, in the same period last year. Quarterly
sales grew 21% to $805.6 million from $667.6 million in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos also said Tuesday that the
company would begin treating stock options as expenses by 2003. In
the wake of recent accounting scandals, analysts have criticized
companies--especially technology firms--for boosting financial
results by disclosing stock options only as a footnote to corporate
financial statements.</LD>
<TE>   The accounting change probably will make it more difficult for
Amazon to show quarterly profit--something it has done only once in
its seven years of operation. But Bezos said it will enable Amazon
"to do a much better job of aligning the interest of shareholders and
employees."</TE>
<TE>   Excluding some expenses and stock-compensation costs, the company
said its loss would have been $4.4 million, or 1 cent a share. That
beat an estimated loss of 6 cents a share, according to analysts
surveyed by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Operating Officer Mark Peek said third-party transactions
represented a strong area of growth, accounting for 35% of North
American orders during the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon collects fees from companies and individuals that sell new
and used products on its site.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon shares fell 95 cents to close at $14.55 on Nasdaq before
its quarterly results were announced. It slipped to $13.72 in
after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Corning Inc., the world's biggest maker of optical fiber and
cable, said its second-quarter loss narrowed to $370 million, or 39
cents a share, from $4.76 billion, or $5.13, last year. Sales slipped
52% to $896 million from $1.87 billion as phone companies curtailed
capital spending.</TE>
<TE>   Corning said it expects to take a pretax restructuring charge of
$125 million to $150 million in the current quarter. The New
York-based company also said it will eliminate 400 jobs in addition
to the 4,000 cuts already announced for this year.</TE>
<TE>   * Flextronics International Ltd., the second-largest maker of
electronics for companies such as Ericsson and Sun Microsystems Inc.,
said it had a first-quarter loss of $131.2 million, or 25 cents a
share, compared with net income of $88.3 million, or 17 cents, a year
earlier. Quarterly sales at the Singapore-based company rose slightly
to $3.13 billion from $3.11 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Santa Monica-based video game maker Activision Inc. said
first-quarter profit surged to $20.7 million, or 31 cents a share,
from $29,000, or break-even, a year earlier. Sales climbed 73% to
$191.3 million from $110.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Online payment provider PayPal Inc. said its second-quarter
profit grew to $529,000, or 1 cent per share, reversing a loss of
$27.7 million, or $4.47 per share, for the same time last year.
Revenue for the Mountain View, Calif., company totaled $53.8 million,
nearly three times more than the $19.7 million generated in last
year's second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. said its second-quarter loss
widened to $117.2 million, or $1.38 a share, after payment of
preferred dividends, from $38.5 million, or 76 cents a share, a year
earlier. XM, the first satellite-radio broadcaster in the U.S., said
quarterly sales were $3.84 million. A comparison to last year's
second quarter isn't available because the company didn't begin
reporting sales until the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   XM said it needs to raise $275 million to be funded through next
year.</TE>
<TE>   SeeBeyond Technology Corp. said its net loss for the second
quarter grew to $7.1 million, or 8 cents a share, up from $6.8
million, or 10 cents a share, last year. Sales at the Monrovia
software maker dipped to $33.7 million from $51.7 million a year
earlier.</TE>

<HD>Treasuries May Not Be the Answer, Some Warn</HD>

<LD>Yields on two-year and five-year Treasury notes plunged Tuesday to
their lowest levels in a generation, as more investors rushed into
government bonds amid the stock market's continuing slump.</LD>
<LD>   But as returns on Treasury securities dwindle, many experts warn
that investors may be underestimating the risks.</LD>
<LD>   The concern isn't about the safety of interest payments or
principal repayment, because there's no question the government will
make good on what it owes.</LD>
<TE>   But if or when market interest rates reverse, the market value of
Treasuries bought at today's prices and yields would tumble. That
could mean losses for investors forced to sell before the securities
mature, or for investors holding bond mutual funds filled with
Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely, when you are down at these low yield levels,
investors could get beat up pretty good" if rates reverse, said Bob
Auwaerter, senior fixed-income manager with mutual fund giant
Vanguard Group, in Valley Forge, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   So far, those risks aren't deterring many investors: On Tuesday,
the yield on the two-year T-note dived to 2.24% from 2.34% on Monday,
as investors snapped up the notes.</TE>
<TE>   The closing yield Tuesday was below the previous low of 2.3% set
in November and is the lowest since the government began regular
sales of two-year notes in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the five-year T-note yield on Tuesday also fell below
its November low, ending at 3.46%, down from 3.56% on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say Treasury buyers today may be betting that the
economy will fall back into recession, causing the Federal Reserve to
cut short-term interest rates from what are already 40-year lows. If
that happens, yields on Treasuries could fall much further, some
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But if the economy remains in recovery mode, and once the stock
market bottoms out, a big question is whether many investors will
quickly abandon Treasuries for better returns in other securities,
causing yields to whiplash.</TE>
<TE>   That happened earlier this year: After plunging to what were then
generational lows in November, Treasury yields surged in the first
quarter. The five-year T-note yield rose from 3.47% in November to
4.84% by March 28.</TE>
<TE>   Auwaerter said an investor buying a five-year T-note yielding
3.45% on Tuesday could see the price of the note drop by 4% if market
interest rates rise 1 percentage point in the next 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   The lower the yield, the greater the vulnerability to interest
rate swings, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to recommend that people invest in government bonds,
given that we've got some of the lowest yields," said Ashok Bhatia,
portfolio manager of a $2.4-billion government bond fund for Strong
Funds in Menomonee Falls, Wis. "But it's still going to beat a lot of
other investments out there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few places investors feel safe right now," said
Bob Gahagan, who heads the $8-billion taxable bond division for
American Century Investments in Mountain View, Calif. "Government
bonds are a place where credit quality is the highest. People are
looking for safety, regardless of the yield."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the timing for investors on the run from stocks may not be
ideal.</TE>
<TE>   To lower the risks, portfolio managers like Auwaerter recommend
that investors stick with short- or intermediate-term bond funds
because longer-term funds could be hurt the most if interest rates
reverse.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think government bonds are guaranteed," Auwaerter
said. "Their credit quality is, and there is a low default risk, but
they have a potential interest rate risk."</TE>

<HD>Tyco Reports a Loss of $2.32 Billion for Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. on Tuesday posted a $2.32-billion quarterly
loss, mostly because of the recent sale of CIT Group Inc. but also
because of the telecom bust and lower margins in its plastics,
electronics and security businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The sharp drop in cash flow came as the conglomerate works to
reduce debt and restore investor confidence after the abrupt
resignation of its longtime chairman.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco shares, which fell about 10% on Tuesday, have been hammered
by an about-face in corporate strategy and questions about its
accounting.</LD>
<TE>   Interim CEO John Fort said Tyco would not certify its past results
until after an internal investigation into its finances is completed
next month. Because it is based in Bermuda, it is not subject to a
new requirement that executives certify their results by Aug. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's cash flow tumbled to $657 million in its fiscal third
quarter ended June 30, far below the company's original estimate of
$900 million to $1.1 billion, largely from stricter payment terms as
suppliers fear a cash crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco reported a net loss of $1.16 a share for the quarter,
including a $2.23-billion charge for the CIT sale, contrasted with
year-earlier net income of $1.17 billion, or 65 cents a share.
Excluding charges and special items, Tyco said it earned 45 cents a
share, compared with 73 cents a year earlier, in line with analysts'
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's revenue from continuing operations rose to $9.12 billion
from $8.68 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco shares fell $1.20 to $10.65 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Investors Pulling the Plug on Utility, Energy Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dynegy, Mirant, Williams and Calpine suffer
huge declines. Credit firms see new reasons to worry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors fleeing yet another economic sector trampled the stocks of
energy companies Tuesday, as fears of more accounting scandals
haunted a power industry already facing a cash crunch.</LD>
<LD>   The rout further depressed stocks trading far below last summer's
highs, suggesting the kind of investor flight from utilities and
energy that devastated dot-com and telecommunications shares.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy Inc. shares plunged 64% as the pipeline giant warned that
its cash flow this year may be 40% less than projected. Williams
Cos., Reliant Energy Inc., Reliant Resources Inc., Calpine Corp. and
Mirant Corp. also suffered huge declines.</LD>
<TE>   A Senate hearing on how banks helped Enron Corp. disguise its
debts served as a worrisome backdrop for the trading session. Shares
of El Paso Corp., the nation's largest natural gas pipeline company,
fell 23% to $10.40 on reports that it relied on off-balance-sheet
partnerships to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books.</TE>
<TE>   As some analysts downgraded the stocks of companies unable to meet
profit projections, the tumbling share prices gave credit-rating
firms new reason to worry, because the companies won't be able to
sell new shares to raise cash. Enron toppled into its monumental
bankruptcy after it was unable to sell stocks and bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "The cash flows and volumes we had expected just are not there,"
said John Whitlock, a director in the Standard &amp; Poor's energy group.
"And a lot of these companies can't access the capital markets."</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P cut its debt rating for Williams, another pipeline operator,
to "junk" status Tuesday, a day after it dropped Dynegy to
non-investment grade. Both companies are approaching deadlines to
refinance their credit lines, Whitlock said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to announcing its dwindling cash flow, Dynegy canceled
a $325-million bond offering for its Illinois Power utility. "I have
serious doubts about their ability to survive," said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst for research firm CreditSights Inc.</TE>
<TE>   So, apparently, did the stock market as Dynegy shares fell $2.15
to $1.23. Williams, meanwhile, was down 82 cents to $1.19. Both fell
below $1 during the session; last August, Williams traded as high as
$33.80 and Dynegy at $47.87.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Energy, which operates three gas utilities and an electric
utility, fell $5.77 to close at $7.90. Mirant, which supplies
electricity and energy services worldwide, fell $1.28 to $2.77, while
Reliant Resources, a producer and trader of electricity, was down
$2.93 to $4.50. Both had been downgraded by Banc of America
Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Other energy and utility stocks took lesser hits. PG&amp;E Corp. fell
$1.05 to close at $11.39; TXU Corp. was down $3.95 to $34.64; and
Aquila Inc. fell 56 cents to $6.</TE>
<TE>   Duke Energy Corp., the nation's second-largest utility company,
fell 30 cents to $19 after reporting a 13% jump in second-quarter
earnings to $474 million, as revenue climbed 4.8% to $16.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond C. Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, downgraded
Dynegy, AES Corp. and Calpine, citing "mounting evidence of
deteriorating industry and corporate fundamentals."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AES, an electricity generator and wholesaler, fell 66
cents to $2.24. Calpine, which also produces electricity, was down 96
cents to $3.12; it said second-quarter earnings would be $72 million,
down from $108 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine Chief Executive Peter Cartwright said the firm was cutting
capital spending and overhead "to ensure sufficient liquidity."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem for those companies is weak prices for
commodities and overbuilding of power plants, Niles said. The
expected addition of 48,000 megawatts of generating capacity this
year and 35,000 megawatts next year "is highly likely to exceed
demand in nearly all scenarios," he wrote.</TE>

<HD>Sales of Vacation Homes Rise</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Californians seek second houses in such areas
as Palm Springs, Lake Tahoe. Latest results mark turnaround from
first half of 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sales of California vacation homes surged during the first half of
2002 as consumers--especially baby boomers--jumped back into the
rapidly appreciating leisure property market.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of second homes climbed 18% from the same period a year
earlier to a total of 6,925, according to a report released Tuesday
by DataQuick Information Systems Inc., a LaJolla firm that tracks
real estate trends.</LD>
<LD>   Prices for vacation homes, ranging from million-dollar estates to
modest cottages, rose nearly 20% to a median price of $171,000,
DataQuick said.</LD>
<TE>   The latest results marked a turnaround from the first half of last
year, when sales had dropped more than 17% from 2000. That decline
broke a string of robust sales years, as rising incomes, an aging
population and favorable tax laws fueled consumer demand for multiple
residences.</TE>
<TE>   From January through June, sales in such well-known resort areas
as Palm Springs, Lake Tahoe and Big Bear rose by double-digit rates
from a year earlier. Still, the increases remain below totals posted
in 1999 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The DataQuick analyst who completed the report, John Karevoll,
attributed the increase to several factors. A growing number of
people are looking for the convenience of a vacation residence that
can be easily reached from their primary homes.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers see such homes as a secure investment, in contrast to
the shaky stock market, he said. And sliding mortgage rates have made
purchases less costly for borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts are also bullish on second homes as baby
boomers--those born between 1946 and 1964--enter their prime earning
years and their homeownership rates rise. Irvine consultant John
Burns completed a study earlier this year that found grayer buyers
will boost growth of upscale and vacation homes in Southern
California.</TE>

<HD>Verizon Agrees to Settle NorthPoint Merger Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Communications Inc. has agreed to pay NorthPoint
Communications Inc. $175 million to settle a $4-billion lawsuit over
their failed merger.</LD>
<LD>   NorthPoint filed suit in November 2000, days after New York-based
Verizon scrapped plans to acquire the high-speed Internet provider
for an estimated $2.15 billion. San Francisco-based NorthPoint filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection weeks later.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement, Verizon will pay NorthPoint $175 million in
cash and withdraw a $31.2 million bankruptcy claim, said Lynn
Schoenmann, a trustee appointed to manage NorthPoint's remaining
business.</LD>
<TE>   A San Francisco jury was scheduled to hear the case starting next
week.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Verizon said the company settled to avoid the
costs involved with a jury trial.</TE>
<TE>   NorthPoint had sought actual and punitive damages of about $4
billion. The defunct Internet company still owes lenders $52 million,
bondholders about $400 million and other creditors about $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement is subject to approval by a bankruptcy judge.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Verizon fell $1.22 to $27.43 on the New York Stock
Exchange. NorthPoint shares rose less than a cent to 23 cents in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>

<HD>Ebbers' Role in WorldCom Woes Probed</HD>
<DH>Telecom: House members want to know whether the former
chairman knew of irregularities. They also seek details about analyst
Grubman's activities.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A House committee investigating WorldCom Inc.'s $3.9-billion
accounting fiasco and other events that led to the nation's biggest
bankruptcy filing sought more detailed evidence late Tuesday on what
former Chairman Bernard J. Ebbers knew about the improper transfers
on the company's books.</LD>
<LD>   The House Committee on Financial Services also requested more
information about the role that stock analyst Jack B. Grubman played
at the company. Grubman, who promoted WorldCom and other telecom
stocks, attended board meetings and had access to the company's
financial information days before it was public. Grubman works for
Salomon Smith Barney, the investment banking unit of Citigroup Inc.</LD>
<LD>   "We're seeking far more detailed information on the questions
raised at the committee hearings" earlier this month, said committee
spokeswoman Peggy Peterson.</LD>
<TE>   The committee sent letters to WorldCom Chief Executive John W.
Sidgmore, Citigroup deputy general counsel Jane C. Sherbourne and
former Arthur Andersen accounting partner Melvin Dick, who oversaw
the firm's audits of WorldCom and other telecommunications companies.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom is "fully cooperating with all investigative bodies,"
said spokesman Brad Burns. Salomon has a "policy to cooperate fully
with any reasonable and legally permissible request by the
committee," said spokeswoman Mary Ellen Hillery. Both declined
further comment. Dick could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   In its letter to Sidgmore, the committee requested information on
whether Ebbers was aware that former Chief Financial Officer Scott D.
Sullivan was moving routine expenses to the capital expenditure line,
effectively boosting revenue by $3.9 billion over 15 months and
allowing the company to post profits instead of losses.</TE>
<TE>   The committee did not ask whether Ebbers knew that transferring
the funds was improper or fraudulent. Sullivan, who was fired June
25, has maintained that the transfers weren't fraudulent. The letter
also asks about claims in the trade periodical Telecom Manager's
Voice Report that the company overbilled customers by $1.8 billion to
$3.5 billion to inflate revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The letters to Sidgmore and Sherbourne ask for details about
Grubman's role at WorldCom and his activities as an analyst,
including whether he has ever issued a "sell" recommendation on a
telecom stock. Committee Chairman Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) has
questioned whether Grubman's failure to recommend that investors sell
WorldCom stock until it became nearly worthless is related to the
"hundreds of millions of dollars" his company earned in underwriting
fees from WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, WorldCom's three main bondholder groups are maneuvering
to get back as much as possible of the $30 billion they're owed in
the firm's reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   How they'll fare depends on whether WorldCom, its MCI
long-distance phone unit and its Intermedia Communications Inc. phone
and data unit are combined or treated separately in a Chapter 11
recovery plan.</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez approved a
Justice Department request to appoint an independent examiner to
investigate possible fraud, mismanagement and irregularities at
WorldCom. The examiner would have the power to request documents
detailing the company's transactions.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Soldiers Complete Training</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>More than 350 Afghan soldiers graduated from training with U.S.
Special Forces troops Tuesday, vowing to serve their country and not
warlords or ethnic groups.</LD>
<LD>   In a ceremony at a military training center in Kabul, the capital,
the soldiers marched briskly past President Hamid Karzai and Defense
Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim.</LD>
<LD>   The event raised hopes that Afghanistan will eventually have a
full-fledged army that can ensure stability and end decades of
conflict among rival ethnic groups.</LD>
<TE>   "The whole world is watching you," Fahim told the 350 enlisted men
and 36 officers of the 1st Battalion, who underwent three months of
intensive training. "All the people are hopeful of this national
army, which should be trusted by all the people. It is a great day
for all the Afghan people."</TE>
<TE>   The group was trained by soldiers from the U.S. Army's 1st
Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group. A second, similar-sized group is
being trained by the French army.</TE>
<TE>   These groups are the beginning of an army that the United Nations
says should eventually number about 60,000. Their members currently
are far outnumbered by the tens of thousands of fighters in private
armies loyal to Afghanistan's warlords.</TE>
<TE>   The ethnic mix of the new soldiers--Pushtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras,
Uzbeks and Nuristanis--was seen as a positive sign that Afghans can
unite as one country. Mohammed Amon, a Hazara, read aloud a poem
celebrating the Afghan culture and reminding his fellow soldiers:
"Though we are from different ethnic groups, we come together as
brothers. We are all Afghans."</TE>

<HD>Welshman Picked as Top Anglican</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Welsh Archbishop Rowan Williams, a renowned theologian and outspoken
opponent of U.S. policies on Afghanistan and Iraq, was chosen Tuesday
to be the 104th archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual leader of the
world's more than 70 million Anglicans.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, whose selection was made by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and confirmed by Queen Elizabeth II, succeeds the Rev. George
Carey, who plans to retire Oct. 31 after 11 years. He is the first
Welshman to be chosen primate of the Church of England.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, 52, defies easy categorization. He has been described as
both theologically orthodox and a liberal, and he is a member of the
anti-abortion Society for the Protection of Unborn Children.</LD>
<TE>   Williams becomes leader of a global communion struggling with
disputes over ordination of women as bishops and attitudes toward
homosexuals. In Britain, he inherits a church undergoing a steep
decline in attendance: It claims 26 million baptized members but
draws no more than a million to Sunday services.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said Tuesday that he was shocked by the "enormous trust"
placed in his hands. "I now have to learn a good many new things ...
how to speak of God in this very public position, in the middle of a
culture which, while it may show a good deal of nostalgia,
fascination and hunger for the spiritual, is generally skeptical of
Christianity."</TE>

month, the largest number of cases in 14 years, the government said.</LD>
<TE>   The outbreak of the illness--which is carried by mosquitoes and
can be fatal if untreated--might have been caused by warmer
temperatures, an increase in rainfall and lax efforts to clear out
standing water that breeds mosquitoes, health officials said. Since
last month, 410 cases have been reported. Symptoms range from
headaches, cramps, rashes and severe muscle and back pain to shock
and hemorrhages leading to death.</TE>

<TE>   Murat Hurtic, a member of the Muslim Commission for Missing

Muslims killed in Srebrenica in 1995," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Srebrenica was declared a U.N. "safe haven," and Muslims flocked
there to escape Serb attacks. But Bosnian Serb troops overran the
town, and up to 8,000 Muslims were believed killed.</TE>

<LD>   The U.S. Justice Department announced indictments against five
alleged leaders of the Muslim separatist group Abu Sayyaf for a
kidnapping spree that led to the death of an American missionary and
several others in the Philippines.</LD>
<TE>   None of the five men indicted were in custody, officials said, but
the five-count indictment gives U.S. authorities the grounds upon
which to seek extradition if they are captured. If convicted, they
could face the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments identified the five as Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani,
Isnilon Totoni Hapilon, Aldam Tilao, Jainal Antel Sali Jr. and
Hamsiraji Marusi Sali. The charges included conspiracy and
hostage-taking resulting in death.</TE>

<HD>Strike Draws a Bush Rebuke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Tuesday admonished Israel for a missile attack that
killed several children along with a leader of the militant Islamic
movement Hamas, a pointed public rebuke that departed from recent
U.S. policy of endorsing Israel's right to defend itself.</LD>
<LD>   "The president believes this heavy-handed action does not
contribute to peace," White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.
"The United States regrets the loss of innocent lives."</LD>
<LD>   The White House's response reflected Washington's fears that the
attack would trigger a new round of violence after a comparative
lull. The strike came just hours after religious leaders of Hamas
indicated a willingness to reconsider the suicide bombings the group
has used against Israel if Israeli forces withdrew from the West
Bank.</LD>
<TE>   At stake is the U.S. effort to jump-start the deadlocked peace
process by pushing the Palestinians to accept massive reforms in
their political and security systems and to abandon Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat in favor of more-democratic
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But to obtain the Palestinian public's support for the strategy,
Bush also has promised to get Israel to moderate its harsh treatment
of the Palestinians--a pledge he publicly affirmed last week during
discussions with the foreign ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise airstrike on a heavily populated residential area of
the Gaza Strip targeted Salah Shehada, the head of Hamas' military
wing, and an aide. But it also killed 13 other people, including nine
children; injured more than 100 Palestinians, predominantly
civilians; and seriously damaged the surrounding area.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a deliberate attack on this site, knowing that innocents
would be lost as a consequence of this attack," Fleischer said.
"Israel has to be mindful of the consequences of its actions to
preserve the path to peace."</TE>
<TE>   The attack took place just as U.S. and Israeli officials had
launched discussions on how to implement a new proposal put forward
by Arab leaders to generate some momentum behind Bush's strategy for
Middle East peace. In a June 24 speech, the president outlined a
vision he said could lead to a Palestinian state in three years.</TE>
<TE>   In talks at the White House last week, Egypt and Jordan proposed
that they help train a new Palestinian security force that could more
effectively work to prevent suicide bombings and other attacks,
according to Egyptian diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt has already provided the Palestinians with proposals on
restructuring their security system, a top Egyptian envoy said
Tuesday. And Egyptian trainers are ready to provide assistance, the
envoy said.</TE>
<TE>   The key to launching the process, however, is an Israeli
withdrawal from reoccupied areas of the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, top Israeli officials from Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's staff talked with U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice about a potential
pilot project as a first step to defuse tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Powell and Rice spoke with Sharon's chief of staff, Dov Weisglass,
and the prime minister's military advisor, Maj. Gen. Moshe Kaplinsky,
about the possible project, which would involve a partial Israeli
withdrawal from one West Bank town, according to Israeli sources.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher later described the
talks as "good, productive and useful. We talked about how to advance
on all these different areas."</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday's missile attack deals a potentially serious setback
to these tentative steps in the peace effort, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing of this action is particularly awkward," said a U.S.
official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The White House hastened to note Tuesday that Bush would continue
to be "the first" to come to Israel's defense.</TE>
<TE>   But the State Department was especially critical of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made it repeatedly clear that we oppose targeted killings,"
Boucher told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "We've repeatedly criticized the use of heavy weaponry in densely
populated areas because of these kinds of dangers of large numbers of
innocent civilians being killed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House reaction was officially relayed to Israel.</TE>

<HD>Democracy's Success Tied to Economics</HD>
<DH>Politics: A backlash against liberalization in many poor,
developing nations could trigger a rise in authoritarianism, a U.N.
report warns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The dramatic spread of democracy around the world could be
jeopardized if free elections in poor countries are not followed by
economic growth, a U.N. agency warned today in a new study of
political progress in developing nations.</LD>
<LD>   With the end of the Cold War bringing down Communist dictatorships
in Eastern Europe and anti-Communist dictatorships in Latin America
and Africa, the number of countries that have at least some trappings
of electoral democracy has more than doubled since 1985 to 140, the
U.N. Development Program said in an annual report.</LD>
<LD>   Yet only 82 of them could be considered genuinely democratic, with
an independent press, legislature and judiciary, it said.</LD>
<TE>   The U.N. agency attempted to quantify other factors that provide
the girding for developed democratic societies, such as the
prevalence of private civic organizations; the variety and
independence of news outlets, the representation of women among
elected and appointed officials, and the perceived professionalism of
police and prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "One multiparty election does not a democracy make," said Mark
Malloch Brown, the U.N. program's chief executive, reviewing the
study's findings for reporters.</TE>
<TE>   In a detailed assessment of what the agency terms "quality of
governance," the U.S. scored sixth, after Norway, Sweden, Canada,
Belgium and Australia. At the bottom of the 173 countries surveyed
were Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Burundi, Niger and Sierra Leone--all
of them in sub-Saharan Africa.</TE>
<TE>   In many younger democracies, especially in Latin America, polls
conducted for the report indicated that there is increasing
skepticism about the benefits of electoral democracy as living
standards decline and income disparities widen. A backlash against
the economic liberalization that has accompanied political
liberalization in much of the developing world could trigger a
resurgence of both authoritarianism and protectionism, the program's
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Democracy gets such a troubled scorecard in so many countries,"
Brown said, noting that many new democracies have lower per capita
earnings than they did two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Though sustained democratic rule has advantages for workers and
investors, there is no immediate correlation between political
freedom and economic growth, the report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "Markets and democracy were the twin panaceas that were supposed
to deliver so many benefits that they have not," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Exacerbating the disenchantment is a growing sense in developing
nations that their elected governments have little power over the
world bodies that set the rules for their economies, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   One factor inhibiting the development of democracy around the
world is the undemocratic structure of most key global institutions,
including the United Nations itself, the report suggested. The U.N.
Security Council, despite decades-old efforts to expand its permanent
membership into Africa, South Asia and Latin America, "is still
widely perceived as an outdated legacy of the Second World War,
functioning primarily as an instrument of a few major powers," the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   The veto-wielding nuclear powers on the council also enjoy
effective control of the U.N.-associated World Bank and International
Monetary Fund, the report said. Together with Japan and Saudi Arabia,
they have nearly half the voting power in those institutions, a
reflection of economic and political clout, not population. The two
financial institutions also remain bastions of male privilege, the
report said, with men occupying every IMF board seat and all but 8%
of the World Bank's.</TE>
<TE>   Representation in the World Trade Organization is skewed against
the world's poor majority as well, the report said, undermining its
earning potential and faith in political institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it is the trade barriers and subsidies that keep the poor
country farmers out of rich country markets, or the slow response to
the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, the leading global powers and
institutions stand accused of being unfair and out of touch," the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the number of overtly authoritarian regimes has dropped
dramatically, from 67 in 1985 to 26 in 2000 by the program's
assessment, and even the most pessimistic U.N. analysts do not
forecast a widespread return to totalitarian or military rule.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the world's Muslims now live in democracies, with India,
Indonesia and Bangladesh at the top of that list, the report noted.
But Arab states lag far behind the rest of the world in almost every
indicator of democratic development, from press freedom to the
political participation of women. Only four of the 17 Arab states
qualify as even nominal democracies.</TE>
<TE>   In East Asia, however, where many political leaders had argued
that local cultural values were unfavorable to the development of
Western-style democracy, elections are becoming more widespread, more
open and more competitive, the U.N. Development Program said.</TE>
<TE>   At the request of governments, the agency is training local
election monitors in Bangladesh, providing legal assistance to East
Timor's fledgling legislature, financing a public information center
for the Indonesian parliament, and helping Laos adapt its laws to
international human rights standards. Democratic roots are deepening
in countries as diverse as South Korea, Singapore and the
Philippines.</TE>

<HD>Faulty Intelligence Blamed in Death Toll</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israelis carried out raid on information that
militant was alone with aide, sources say. Government is widely
criticized for the attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>As criticism poured in from both domestic and international fronts,
the Israeli government defended its deadly airstrike in the Gaza
Strip on Tuesday, but acknowledged that an intelligence lapse led to
the deaths of more than a dozen Palestinian civilians, including
infants and other children.</LD>
<LD>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he regretted the loss of innocent
life but declared the raid "one of our biggest successes" because it
killed Salah Shehada, a senior leader of the militant Hamas group.
Shehada, 49, was suspected of masterminding hundreds of terrorist
attacks in which scores of Israelis died.</LD>
<LD>   But two high-ranking Israeli military sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that because of the number of civilian
casualties, "the results [of the strike] weren't what we hoped."</LD>
<TE>   They said the firing of the single missile that blew up Shehada's
two-story home would not have gone forward had they known that people
other than Shehada and one of his aides, who also was killed, might
get hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians scoff at the idea that the Israeli military could not
have predicted that firing a missile into the heart of one of Gaza
City's most crowded neighborhoods would result in civilian
casualties. The explosion badly damaged surrounding homes, sending
rubble and shrapnel flying as residents slept. Officials in Gaza on
Tuesday upped the death toll to 15. Nine of the dead were children,
including two under 2 years old. More than 100 people were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Israeli military sources disagreed with the Bush
administration's criticism of the attack as "heavy-handed." They said
the army acted on intelligence that Shehada was alone with his
associate inside the house, a big, empty, newly built structure.</TE>
<TE>   The information turned out to be flawed: Shehada apparently was
accompanied by his wife and a daughter, who also died in the raid.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the sources said that by taking out Shehada, the founder of
Hamas' military wing, the army foiled his plans to mount a major
attack within the next few days against Jewish settlers in the Gaza
Strip. The operation was to involve multiple suicide bombers, the
sources said. They declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas has claimed responsibility for many suicide attacks over the
last two years. The Israeli military linked Shehada himself to
several bombings in the last 12 months that killed and wounded dozens
of Israelis. The list includes an attack on Passover in the city of
Netanya that killed 29.</TE>
<TE>   The military sources spoke to reporters at a hastily convened
briefing that was clearly aimed at deflecting criticism. In addition
to the U.S., the United Nations, the European Union, Arab nations and
human rights groups such as Amnesty International have condemned the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   "This massacre is unbelievable," said Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat. The attack was "an awful crime carried out
against our innocent children."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem accused the government of
adopting the same terrorist tactics it claims to abhor and of
entering "a new phase of disregard for the fundamental principles of
law and morality."</TE>
<TE>   Some Israeli officials also questioned the wisdom of launching an
airstrike when progress in easing Israeli-Palestinian tensions seemed
to be in sight. Just hours before the airstrike, a Hamas leader said
his group would consider calling off suicide attacks if Israeli
forces withdrew from the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Tentative negotiations on a possible phased pullout took place
between Palestinian and Israeli ministers over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government insisted that it needed to strike out of
self-defense. The military said that it had repeatedly asked
Palestinian security services to crack down on Shehada, but that the
Palestinian side had never acted.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli media reported that Israeli security forces had decided
months ago to target Shehada.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Israeli forces tried to smoke him out at his family's
home in the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun, but Shehada was not
there.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to go ahead with Tuesday's airstrike was made by
Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, but Israeli radio reported
that neither Ben-Eliezer nor Sharon had been told that such extensive
civilian casualties were possible.</TE>
<TE>   As evidence of the Israelis' desire to avoid civilian deaths, the
two military sources said that an attack on Shehada was planned
several days ago but aborted when the army discovered that members of
his family were with him.</TE>
<TE>   The military described Shehada, who grew up in a refugee camp in
the Gaza Strip, as an "arch-terrorist" who both shaped Hamas'
ideology of violence and helped to carry it out. He held the purse
strings and approved the purchase of weapons, explosives and rockets,
the military sources said. Shehada knew that he was a wanted man, so
he used evasive tactics to move through Gaza and elude capture, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   In other Israeli military action Tuesday, soldiers killed two
suspected terrorists just hours after the airstrike, the army said.
The two men were heavily armed, had penetrated into Israel proper and
were trying to get into the Kisufim kibbutz, north of the Gaza Strip,
to attack the residents there, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   Three other Palestinians were killed near the West Bank city of
Nablus. They were dressed in Israeli army uniforms, toted AK-47 and
M-16 rifles, and also were intending to mount a terrorist attack, the
military said.</TE>

<HD>Iranian President Blasts U.S.</HD>
<DH>Speech: Khatami, in Malaysia, says America needs to tone
down its hostile rhetoric.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>Iranian President Mohammad Khatami lashed out at the United States
and Israel on Tuesday, accusing Washington of promoting war and the
Israeli government of cruelty.</LD>
<LD>   "We live in a frightening situation today," Khatami said at a news
conference during an official visit to Malaysia. "In the course of
the history of the world ... we have never witnessed war being
promoted so much [as] in the United States."</LD>
<LD>   Khatami, whose attempts at reform have met with resistance from
hard-liners in his Islamic nation, said Iran would have "no problem"
with the United States if it toned down its hostile rhetoric.</LD>
<TE>   Khatami said Washington was using "the tongue of threats and
insults" against Iran, and rejected President Bush's accusation that
Iran was part of an "axis of evil" with North Korea and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The great nation of Iran has never trod on the path of evil,"
Khatami said. "Evil is when a country has power and defines
everything according to its own interests."</TE>
<TE>   Khatami has received a warm welcome in Malaysia. On Monday, he
held talks with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.</TE>
<TE>   The visit comes amid a wave of anti-U.S. sentiment in Iran
triggered by remarks Bush made this month expressing support for the
reform movement. His comments were seen as U.S. meddling in the power
struggle between Iran's reformists and hard-liners. Hard-liners have
accused the reformists of being pawns of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Khatami also criticized Washington for backing Israeli Premier
Ariel Sharon's government. "The most suppressive and cruel government
in the world is Israel," Khatami said Tuesday at a separate event.
"It is being supported by the United States."</TE>

<HD>Gaza Inflamed After Israeli Raid</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Tens of thousands attend mass funeral for victims.
Jews brace for more attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Rage coursed through Gaza City's overheated streets Tuesday as tens
of thousands of Palestinians marched to a single mass funeral for 15
people killed in a midnight Israeli airstrike on a crowded
neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   The dead included the top military commander of the militant group
Hamas, who Israel said was its intended target, and nine
children--among them a 2-month-old whose flag-shrouded body was held
aloft by furious mourners chanting for revenge.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the victims were killed as they slept in their homes. Many
of the mourners, masked and dressed in battle fatigues, fired
automatic weapons into the air as they thronged Gaza's Omari Mosque
and then the cemetery, all the while vowing to make Israel pay.
Others wore green shrouds that symbolized their intention to become
suicide bombers.</LD>
<TE>   "Death to Israel! Death to America!" they shouted.</TE>
<TE>   Although threats of revenge are par for the course in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Tuesday's emotion was different. It was
the largest, and angriest, funeral in Palestinian territory in years.
For Palestinians, Israel's action--the unleashing of F-16 warplanes
on a residential street--crossed a red line. It also torpedoed
fledgling efforts by both sides to reduce the deadly violence of the
last 22 months and unified all militant Palestinian groups arrayed
against the Jewish state, including several that recently claimed
they were considering a halt to attacks on Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration leveled rare criticism at the government
of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, labeling the raid "heavy-handed."
With condemnation mounting from around the globe and, unusually, from
across Israel's political spectrum, a horrific round of renewed
violence seemed all but inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not rest until the Jews see pieces of bodies in each
restaurant, in their bars, their buses, on their streets," Hamas'
military wing, Izzidin al-Qassam, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "We will make funerals for every Jewish house, every Jewish
street."</TE>
<TE>   The target of the attack, Salah Shehada, is the most senior Hamas
official to be killed by Israel.</TE>
<TE>   When Israel killed Hamas' military commander in the West Bank,
Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, in November, the group followed with a spate of
suicide bombings a week later.</TE>
<TE>   When its top bomb maker, Yehiya Ayash, was killed after Israeli
agents booby-trapped his cellular phone in 1996, a wave of bombings
killed dozens of people.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis again braced for a round of bloodshed, but officials
defended the raid, saying the killing of the founder of Hamas'
military wing was a "major success" in Israel's war on terrorism.
Israel regards Shehada as the mastermind behind scores of deadly
attacks on its civilians. He was "stained with the blood of hundreds
of Israelis," a top Israeli army commander said.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it regretted the loss of innocent life but blamed
Shehada's use of "human shields."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the dead were Shehada's neighbors, whose apartments were
leveled or badly damaged when a missile from a U.S.-made F-16 hit the
building where Shehada was visiting his wife and 14-year-old
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The force of the blast sent shrapnel and broken concrete flying a
block or more. Five apartment buildings of two to four stories
sustained heavy damage.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like an earthquake--no, like a nuclear bomb," said Abdul
Naem Hamada, a 28-year-old neighbor who rushed to the scene after the
deafening explosion sent red and black smoke billowing.</TE>
<TE>   Omar Huweiti, 16, lay trapped in the rubble for half an hour until
neighbors and medics could rescue him. The cries of the injured and
dying filled the dust-choked air.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw shrapnel and concrete falling on our heads," Omar said.
"We tried to call for help."</TE>
<TE>   Omar was hit in the back and foot and was recovering at Gaza
City's Shifa Hospital. But two of his cousins, 5-year-old Mohammed
and 4-year-old Subhi, were killed, along with their mother, Mona
Huweiti. They were found on the floor of their bedroom, crushed by
concrete pillars, Omar said.</TE>
<TE>   Huweiti's husband, Mahmoud, was seriously hurt. He lay in a
hospital bed, his legs, arms and face covered with cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sleeping, and the sound woke me up," he said, speaking with
difficulty as he recalled the hours of terror. It was dark, and the
electricity and phones were out as his small home's corrugated metal
roof, and then the walls, toppled.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard my daughter crying, 'Help me, Dad. Help me, Dad.' I tried
to help her, but I couldn't reach her."</TE>
<TE>   The daughter, 10-year-old Iman, survived. Her head wrapped in a
bloodied bandage, she sat with three injured brothers in the
hospital. Six-year-old Khamis' face was bruised and swollen, the
crown of his head also bandaged.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the neighborhood insisted that no one knew that
Shehada was frequenting their street. His family had taken refuge
there only within the last 10 days to two weeks, residents said.</TE>
<TE>   They all held the United States as responsible as Israel for the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of the raid, youths had used red spray paint to adorn
the cracked, crumbled ruins with graffiti, in English for the benefit
of the descending hordes of foreign journalists: "This is the
American weapon," and "This is the Israeli peace."</TE>
<TE>   "Let Sharon and America be happy!" an older woman cried as she
picked her way through what was left of her home.</TE>
<TE>   In the four-story apartment building belonging to the Saeedy
family, about 50 yards from the site of the blast, every window was
blown out, walls were punched with holes and appliances thrown to the
floor.</TE>
<TE>   No one was killed, but 25 children were hospitalized with
injuries, the family said. Khaled Saeedy's collection of birds, about
80 gray-brown finches and green parakeets, lay dead, the bodies
scattered amid the debris.</TE>
<TE>   Just behind the building where Shehada was killed, the blast
peeled away the facade of the Matar family home, exposing upturned
furniture and disheveled mattresses. Six members of the extended
family were killed, including 2-month-old Dina; her 11-year-old
brother; and her three cousins, ages 5, 4 and 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   "The world sees this and does nothing!" wailed Nabila Khattab, 47,
a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   The chaotic funeral procession left Shifa Hospital and headed to
the mosque, filling the streets with gunmen, mourners and cars
blaring their horns. Young boys clambered onto the backs of pickup
trucks or clung to the sides of vans to join in. Hamas fighters
marched side by side with masked, well-armed guerrillas from the Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with the Fatah movement of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. A sea of green, red,
yellow, white and black flags, representing every militant stripe,
followed.</TE>
<TE>   Three wooden coffins in green shrouds were hoisted through the
crowd to the mosque, followed by bodies wrapped in Palestinian flags
and shuttled through on litters.</TE>
<TE>   The 2-month-old girl was carried by a male relative, who in turn
was carried on the shoulders of other men. He held the dark-haired
baby aloft in his outstretched arms, like a sacrificial offering. She
was wrapped in a Palestinian flag. A tiny arm, fist clenched, dangled
from her swaddling.</TE>
<TE>   As she passed by, the frenzied chants of revenge and martyrdom hit
a fevered pitch, with men screaming on loudspeakers and guns
exploding.</TE>
<TE>   "Our reaction will be very harsh," said a masked commander of the
Hamas military wing, who was leading a unit in the procession. "We
are on a jihad path, to victory or martyrdom. We will not stop as
long as blood flows in our veins."</TE>
<TE>   Funeral organizers said the bodies of Shehada, his wife, their
daughter and Shehada's bodyguard were so shredded that they had to
place the remains in a single coffin.</TE>
<TE>   Shehada--a veteran of Israeli prisons and mentioned as a possible
successor to Hamas' supreme leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin--had been
living underground for months and only occasionally surfaced to visit
his family. Israel's security forces had been after him for years.</TE>
<TE>   Israel said Shehada had orchestrated a string of attacks on
civilians in Israel, including suicide bombings at a discotheque and
pizzeria, as well as assaults on Jewish settlers and soldiers inside
the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday at midday, a grim Yassin visited the site where Shehada
was killed, viewing the destruction, and later attended the mass
funeral. Aides and gunmen whisked the wheelchair-bound spiritual
leader through the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "The revenge," Yassin told reporters, "will be impossible to
describe."</TE>

<HD>Mugabe Says Food Deficits Not His Fault</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe</DL>
<LD>A defiant President Robert Mugabe vowed Tuesday to continue seizing
white-owned farms, saying drought and growing international
isolation, not his policies, were to blame for food shortages that
threaten half of Zimbabwe's people with starvation.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at the opening of parliament, Mugabe described his land
redistribution program as "an unparalleled success," saying more than
5,000 white-owned commercial farms had been transferred to blacks.</LD>
<LD>   Mugabe has said the farm seizures are the only way to ensure that
landless blacks have access to farmland, but the program has brought
commercial farming to a grinding halt and left the country with a
2-million-ton grain shortage this year.</LD>
<TE>   Many of the farms have not gone to landless blacks but to Mugabe's
associates.</TE>
<TE>   Aid agencies have launched urgent appeals, but Western donors have
been reluctant to pour money into Zimbabwe's economy. The ruling
party also has been accused of using food as a political weapon.</TE>

<HD>Pope's North American Visit Off to a Strong Start in Canada</HD>
<DH>Religion: The elderly pontiff, in Toronto for World Youth
Day, strays from the script and surprises crowd with his walk down
steep steps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II, beginning an 11-day journey in the Americas, told
a gathering of young Roman Catholic pilgrims here Tuesday that they
"bear the marks of a humanity that too often does not know peace or
justice."</LD>
<LD>   But as he veered from his official itinerary, John Paul's actions
left a greater impression than his words during the short ceremony at
Pearson International Airport that kicked off a weeklong World Youth
Day gathering.</LD>
<LD>   After an overseas flight from Italy, the frail 82-year-old pontiff
drew applause and some gasps from the airport crowd by electing to
climb down the steep steps pushed against the private Boeing 767
passenger jet instead of using a lift as planned. Slowed by a broken
hip, arthritic knee and Parkinson's disease, John Paul took about two
minutes to walk down the ramp, with his white alb and hair flowing in
the humid breeze.</LD>
<TE>   "He has this rapport with young people," said Anthony Meagher,
archbishop of Kingston, Canada. "And I think he said, 'I'll just walk
down those steps to show that I'm here for [the young people] as
strong as I can be.' I had tears in my eyes."</TE>
<TE>   At a nearby hangar, the pope, flanked by Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, gave a short message in French and English to a handpicked
crowd of a few hundred, including Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien and World Youth Day children from six continents.</TE>
<TE>   "With their gifts of intelligence and heart, [young people]
represent the future of the world," said John Paul, reading in a
strong voice from notes. "Too many lives begin and end without joy,
without hope. That is one of the principal reasons for World Youth
Day."</TE>
<TE>   The pope told the young pilgrims that they need to commit
themselves "to the great cause of peace and human solidarity."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul is the founder and star attraction of the event, which
is held about every two years and sometimes dubbed "Pope-stock." This
year's World Youth Day has drawn more than 200,000 Catholics from 169
countries.</TE>
<TE>   After his short speech, the pope strayed again from official
protocol and asked a local priest to bring him "20 to 25 young
people." As the children stood or knelt before him, John Paul touched
their cheeks, said a few words and blessed them. Many walked away
crying.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard that when you work with Pope John Paul II, you have to
be ready for surprises," said Father Thomas Rosica, national director
of World Youth Day. "None of those young people who came to see him
were prepared. The exchanges and the gestures were really, really
moving."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinals and bishops who have attended meetings and ceremonies
with the pope in recent years said they have grown used to his
slurred speech, restricted movements and limited stamina. But they
say the trip and especially the youth seemed to have rejuvenated
him--at least for one day. Cardinal Aloysius Ambrozic of Toronto said
watching the more animated John Paul reminded him of one of the
pontiff's often-repeated tenets: "When one is with the young, one
becomes young."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, in a concession to his failing health, John Paul was
whisked away by helicopter after the airport ceremony to a nearby
Catholic retreat on a Lake Simcoe island for two days of rest. He
ordered the flight plan changed so he could fly over the site of
World Youth Day near the shores of Lake Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   The pope won't appear in public again until late Thursday
afternoon, when he will greet the entire gathering of pilgrims at a
welcoming service. He will also speak at a youth vigil Saturday and
conduct a huge outdoor Mass on Sunday, the climactic event of World
Youth Day. Crowds well into the hundreds of thousands are expected
and 30 acres of portable toilets have been put in place.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this year's number of registrants--once expected to be
750,000--has been far short of predictions and a fraction of previous
attendance figures at other World Youth Days. In 1995, 4.5 million
people attended festivities in the Philippines, and in 1993, 600,000
Catholics went to Denver for the event.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers say they are baffled by the relatively low turnout,
though they theorize that parents might be reluctant to have their
children travel internationally after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul will leave Toronto on Monday for Guatemala and will end
his trip to the Americas in Mexico.</TE>

<HD>Rabin's Daughter Quits Israeli Defense Ministry in
Frustration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Dalia Rabin-Pelossof resigned
Tuesday, and colleagues said she quit because she was frustrated by
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's reluctance to reopen peace talks with
the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Rabin-Pelossof is the daughter of assassinated Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, who began a peace process with the Palestinians in
1993. She had been increasingly critical of Sharon's hard-line
leadership in recent months, but there was no indication that
Israel's deadly attack early Tuesday in the Gaza Strip was a reason
for her resignation.</LD>
<LD>   Rabin-Pelossof has been urging the moderate Labor Party, to which
she belongs, to withdraw from Sharon's government, but the party has
remained in the coalition with his hard-line Likud.</LD>
<TE>   "She could no longer be part of this government that tells the
Israeli public that there are no solutions to our problems," Labor
lawmaker Ophir Pines-Paz told the Haaretz newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Rabin-Pelossof will remain a member of parliament and will expand
her work with the Rabin Center for Peace, Haaretz said.</TE>
<TE>   She has publicly expressed opposition to Sharon's efforts to
isolate Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "The government decided that Arafat is not relevant," she said on
Israel Television in December. "This is not my opinion. In the end,
we will have to speak to someone."</TE>

<HD>A Tale of Torn Loyalties for Tibetan Officials</HD>
<DH>Asia: Many former serfs have aligned with China and against
the Dalai Lama. They struggle with tradition versus modernity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LHASA, Tibet</DL>
<LD>Chunphel's rebellion came early in life, when his stomach overruled
his scant faith in Buddhism. "Even though it was sacrilege, I used to
steal offerings of fruit from the temples because I was hungry," he
recalls.</LD>
<LD>   The eldest of 10 children in a poor family, Chunphel was a
nangsen, or hereditary domestic servant, stoking fires and brewing
yak butter tea on the estate of a Tibetan county official.</LD>
<LD>   But when Beijing quashed a Tibetan rebellion in 1959 and the
region's top theocrat, the Dalai Lama, fled into exile, Chunphel
joined a Communist Party-led work team that redistributed
aristocrats' land and livestock to poor peasants.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd lived through a lot of hardship and poverty. I was
enthusiastic about the work and was a natural 'activist' " whom the
Chinese groomed for Communist Party membership, he said. Chunphel,
who, like many Tibetans, uses a single name, joined the party in
1960.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Chunphel is vice chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region,
the No. 2 official in the local government.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing has carefully cultivated Tibetan officials such as
Chunphel, many of whom are also former serfs. More than half a
century of Chinese rule in Tibet has produced a group of elite
Tibetans who have cast their lot with China and against the Dalai
Lama.</TE>
<TE>   China claims that 75% of Tibetan officials are ethnic Tibetans and
cites that as proof that the region enjoys autonomy under Chinese
rule.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin proclaimed that Tibetan
officials are "fully trusted by the [Communist] Party and people."</TE>
<TE>   But the Dalai Lama has said: "Naturally, 99% of [Tibetans]--be
they young, old, cadres, officials--are deeply resentful of the
Chinese occupation of Tibet."</TE>
<TE>   So where do Tibetan officials' loyalties lie?</TE>
<TE>   In the polarized debate between Beijing and Dharamsala, India, the
seat of the Tibetan government in exile, it is easy to dismiss
Tibetan officials as either Beijing's powerless puppets or the Dalai
Lama's closet allies. But such viewpoints oversimplify the question
of Tibetan officials' loyalties, which are far more complex than
either side wants to admit.</TE>
<TE>   "Tibetans can never go back to their previous state of uniformity;
they have already split into different, irreconcilable groups,"
writes Wang Lixiong in his Hong Kong-published 1998 book, "Sky
Burial," the most critical assessment of China's Tibet policy by a
mainland Chinese author.</TE>
<TE>   Wang argues that the walls between Tibetan officials and exiles,
nationalists and Communists are for now insurmountable.</TE>
<TE>   He adds that these divisions are symptomatic of deeper fissures in
Tibetans, who are pulled apart by tradition and modernity, secularity
and spirituality. "This spiritual schism is the Tibetans' greatest
tragedy," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   Without this disunity, it could be very difficult for Beijing to
control Tibet, which used to be ethnically and religiously cohesive.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that Tibetan officials working for the Chinese
establishment in Tibet are basically creatures of circumstance," said
Thubten Samphel, a spokesman for the Tibetan government in exile.</TE>
<TE>   He paraphrased a high-ranking Chinese official who reportedly told
his Tibetan colleagues, "Your stomach is with the Communist Party,
but your heart lies with the Dalai Lama."</TE>
<TE>   Among Tibetan elites, the stomachs are increasingly winning out.</TE>
<TE>   Getting ahead in Tibet these days requires being savvy in the
lingo and culture of Chinese officialdom. It often requires an
education in one of the many schools Beijing has established to train
and inculcate Tibetan bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   And it often entails joining the party, which, at least
theoretically, requires one to be an atheist and take part in the
chorus of official denunciations of the Dalai Lama.</TE>
<TE>   To some Tibetan officials, falling in line with Beijing is less a
matter of loyalty than of self-interest. In a strategic bid to
bolster political stability and its own public image, Beijing has
vastly increased its spending on development and infrastructure
projects in Tibet.</TE>
<TE>   For the Tibetan officials in charge of these projects, this
creates opportunities for corruption. Last year, China's railway
minister pledged to prevent the embezzlement of funds from one of
Beijing's largest projects in the region: the $3-billion, 700-mile
Qinghai-Tibet Railway.</TE>
<TE>   But Beijing must keep the funds flowing and the Tibetan officials
sated to avoid the social discontent that can spark calls for Tibetan
independence. When pro-independence riots rocked Lhasa in 1989,
central government funding for Tibet rose 20%, according to official
statistics. In 1990, it rose 84%.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing's spending is evident all over Lhasa, which has ballooned
to many times its historical size and begun to look like a typical
Chinese city. But it is also evident that urbanites, officials and
employees of state-owned companies--the people Beijing counts on to
maintain stability in Tibet--are the main beneficiaries of the
gleaming new hotels, museums and department stores.</TE>
<TE>   While publicly professing trust in Tibetan officials, privately
Beijing has been alarmed during the last decade about their
sometimes-ambivalent political loyalties.</TE>
<TE>   At a key meeting of Tibetan and central government officials in
1994, Tibet's Communist Party Vice Chief Ragdi warned that, because
of the Dalai Lama's persistent influence, "some of our party members
believe in religion and have participated in religious activities.
Some cadres and leaders have prayer rooms and altars in their houses
and hang up the Dalai's pictures."</TE>
<TE>   Even more disturbing, he said, "some cadres act as secret enemy
agents and collect confidential information for the Dalai clique."</TE>
<TE>   One such figure was Chadrel Rinpoche, a national parliamentarian
and part of a group of Tibetan clerics selected to search for the
reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama, the second-highest monk in
Tibetan Buddhism. In 1995, he leaked the results of the search to the
Dalai Lama. Two years later, Beijing jailed Chadrel for six years,
and Tibet now has two Panchens, one recognized by the Dalai Lama and
the other by Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union also prompted some Tibetan
officials to question the region's political future. Some marry their
children into the old Tibetan aristocracy or, as Ragdi noted, send
"their children abroad to be educated in schools run by the Dalai
clique to leave leeway for themselves" in the event of a regime
change in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend that the real power in Tibet lies with the Han, or
ethnic Chinese, officials. They note that the proportion of Tibetan
officials is lower in the top levels of government and that Tibetan
officials are often overshadowed by their Han deputies or Communist
Party secretaries.</TE>
<TE>   According to official statistics, Tibetans make up more than 90%
of the region's legislature, courts and police force, but the Han
dominate many leadership positions and the military in Tibet.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the thousands of Tibetan officials who constitute the
region's elite are an interest group that neither Beijing nor
Dharamsala can leave out of its calculations.</TE>
<TE>   The Dalai Lama has proposed that in a future, independent Tibet,
"the existing administration in Tibet, with all its Tibetan
functionaries, will be retained."</TE>
<TE>   But some officials in Tibet doubt this pledge and fear retribution
at the hands of the exiles. "Tibetan cadres will come to no good end
if the Dalai Lama returns," predicted Chunphel.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinary Tibetans' attitudes about their officials are seldom
black or white. Though they often scoff at Tibetan leaders' incessant
public tirades against the Dalai Lama, they are also concerned about
how the leaders perform.</TE>
<TE>   One young Tibetan entrepreneur said of his uncle who serves as a
local official: "When I was young, I thought he was stupid, and that
officials' work was all for show. Now I realize that he was trying to
do something for his own people."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the conflicted loyalties of Tibetan officials are due to
the violent reversals in Beijing's policies on Tibet.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1950s, Beijing tried to rule Tibet through its
traditional government and aristocracy. The young Dalai Lama was
given an official Chinese position and feted in Beijing by the
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   But the policy failed to win Tibetans' support, and beginning in
1959, Beijing rallied poor serfs such as Chunphel under the banner of
class struggle in order to smash the old order.</TE>
<TE>   During China's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Chunphel, Ragdi and
many other Tibetans in power today joined the Red Guards, gangs of
fanatical Maoist youths who went around Tibet smashing Buddhist
temples. Chunphel traveled the country and saw Chairman Mao in
Beijing twice.</TE>
<TE>   "Mao Tse-tung was our idol and we worshipped him fervently," he
said. "In our hearts, we were most grateful to him for liberating us
from the oppression of serfdom."</TE>

<HD>Milosevic Denies Covering Up Massacre</HD>
<DH>Tribunal: He says smugglers killed ethnic Albanians whose
bodies were found in Danube.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>Slobodan Milosevic denied Tuesday that he ordered a cover-up of war
crimes, saying that ethnic Albanians whose bodies were packed into a
freezer truck and dumped in the Danube River were victims of human
traffickers, not Serbian army troops.</LD>
<LD>   In dramatic testimony, a U.N. war crimes tribunal heard from two
Serbian policemen. The dumping incident could be crucial to the
prosecution's case that Milosevic orchestrated atrocities in the
Serbian province of Kosovo and then tried to cover them up.</LD>
<LD>   On April 6, 1999, Serbian policeman Bosko Radojkovic and a scuba
diver were sent to investigate what looked like a large white box
floating in the Danube. Radojkovic told the court that the box was a
white Mercedes freezer truck with Kosovo license plates, and markings
of the Export Slaughterhouse from the Kosovo town of Prizren.</LD>
<TE>   When they pulled the truck from the water, they saw a leg dangling
from a partially open cargo door, and found 86 corpses inside,
including those of two children, Radojkovic testified. Most bore
signs of being stabbed or bludgeoned, he said. Some of the women's
bodies were dressed in the traditional dress of ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   "Only one young man had a gunshot chest wound, and his hands were
tied with wire," said the policeman, speaking in dry, unemotional
tones. The rest had "wounds inflicted with sharp objects or blunt
instruments," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Working at night, police moved the decomposing bodies into a
flatbed truck, Radojkovic said, which then headed toward central
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. The truck was burned to its
frame, then blown up, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dragan Karleusa, a Serbian police captain, said it appeared that
the bodies were reburied at a police training base near the Serbian
capital, but the identification of those bodies is not yet
conclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic contested the scenario described by the prosecution,
arguing that the people who died in the truck were victims of human
traffickers. He cited official reports that smuggling people to
Western Europe was rampant in that region.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking here about an organized criminal group. People had
drowned when the lorry toppled and ended up in the river," he said,
cross-examining the prosecution witnesses.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Religious Students Can Opt Out of Army Duty</HD>
<DH>Military: Legislation highlights the divide between
ultra-Orthodox and secular Jews.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Over the bitter objections of those who call it discriminatory, the
Israeli parliament Tuesday legalized the tradition of exempting
thousands of religious men from having to serve in the military.</LD>
<LD>   Under the law, which squeaked through a divided Knesset, Israel's
ultra-Orthodox men are allowed to skip the compulsory military
service that marks a rite of passage for the vast majority of this
country's youth.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Israel's haredim, or ultra-Orthodox, are entitled to take
a year off, at the age of 22, from their yeshiva studies to work and
decide whether they want to return to a life of religious
contemplation or serve an abbreviated or modified form of military
service. Either way, they would be spared the full three-year tour of
duty required of most young men and women after they turn 18.
(Religious women are exempt.)</LD>
<TE>   The Knesset vote capped two years of rancorous debate that further
divided the religious and the secular in Israel, a split one
legislator described as "two worlds, two poles: heaven and earth."</TE>
<TE>   The haredim argue that their faithful study of the Torah is
crucial for Jews to flourish and to ensure God's continued
protection. They also fear that mixing with nonobservant Jews,
especially women, would expose them to the seductions of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Many secular Jews, however, complain that the ultra-Orthodox enjoy
the protection of the Israeli military without contributing anything
to it. Opponents of the so-called Tal bill took out full-page ads in
Israel's main daily newspapers denouncing it as a state-sanctioned
way for Israelis to dodge the draft.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tal bill discriminates between blood. The Tal bill violates
the principle of equality, which is the foundation of democracy," the
ad said. "The people of Israel will remember on Election Day who sold
them out to the haredim," the advertisement warned.</TE>
<TE>   Parliament members from Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Likud Party
voted en bloc for the bill. Despite differences of opinion within the
party, Likud leaders demanded strict compliance on the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Sharon himself spoke passionately against the
proposal when it was introduced by his rival, then-Prime Minister
Ehud Barak. But as with Barak then, Sharon needs the support of
Israel's right-wing legislators to stay comfortably in power. On
Tuesday, he voted in favor of the bill with "a heavy heart,"
acknowledging that the legislation fell short of offering "true
equality."</TE>
<TE>   Such equality has not prevailed in military service since Israel
was founded in 1948. Then, David Ben-Gurion allowed about 400 yeshiva
students to defer joining the army. The exception became the status
quo, with those now excused from military service numbering about
30,000.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1999, Israel's Supreme Court ruled that the haredim could
no longer enjoy automatic exemption from military service, forcing
the Knesset to confront the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing debate cut to the heart of the paradox many Israelis
are constantly trying to reconcile: how Israel can be a Jewish and a
democratic state at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   For the ultra-Orthodox, there is no question which comes first.</TE>
<TE>   "The state is not doing yeshiva students a favor by letting them
study" instead of serving in the military, said Knesset member Shmuel
Halpert, an ultra-Orthodox Jew. "They are studying not for
themselves, but for the whole people of Israel, and Israel needs them
more than they need Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the blanket exemption caused an uproar this week
when posters went up comparing the army to a brothel.</TE>
<TE>   But the outrage was not enough to sink the bill in spite of
impassioned calls from opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no one whose blood is redder than that of another or who
is entitled to benefits for reasons of his religion, race, sex or
color," said Yossi Paritzky, whose Shinui party has made opposition
to the blanket exemption a major plank in its platform. "This law ...
will legally discriminate between people based on religion--based on
a way of life and nothing else."</TE>

<HD>Did Telecom Reformers Dial the Wrong Number?</HD>
<DH>Deregulation: A 1996 landmark law may be at the root of the
industry's meltdown, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK and JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the wreckage of once-highflying telecommunications companies such
as WorldCom Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd. piles up, attention is
turning to whether the root of the disaster lies in the sweeping
deregulation set in motion in the mid-1990s that was expected to
usher in a golden age of competition.</LD>
<LD>   Prices would fall, service would improve and everyone would make
more money. Anticipation ran high that the industry was on the verge
of explosive growth, fueled by the still-nascent Internet, wireless
phones, satellite television and other telecommunications services
that would keep the public in a state of constant connection.</LD>
<LD>   Much of that vision was flawed, leading to more than $2 trillion
in investment, much of it squandered in ways that may cause lasting
economic damage. On Tuesday, two major telecommunications firms
reported quarterly losses of more than $20 billion and said they
would cut more than 7,000 jobs.</LD>
<TE>   The telecommunications industry is awash in red ink and tens of
thousands of jobs have been lost. Some analysts believe the
bankruptcy filings of WorldCom and Global Crossing, two of the most
aggressive new companies to arise during deregulation, presage more
to come. Since their peak in March 2000, telecommunications stocks,
as measured by the American Stock Exchange index of 16 North American
companies, have fallen more than 74%.</TE>
<TE>   The meltdown has occurred under the legal structure set up by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996. Critics complain that the act has led
to poor service and higher costs for consumers, with some of those
costs hidden in a proliferation of oddball fees.</TE>
<TE>   "Telecom deregulation from '96 until now has been an abysmal
failure," said Gene Kimmelman, director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The telecom industry bust adds support to critics' contentions
that deregulation has failed to live up to its promise in this
industry, as it did in airlines, banking, energy and cable
television.</TE>
<TE>   In each of those, the original expectations that huge numbers of
new companies would increase competition, improve service and reduce
prices have given way to the reality of oligopolies controlling large
chunks of the marketplace in ways that leave customers discontented.</TE>
<TE>   More than two decades after the airlines were deregulated, for
example, only eight airlines carry the vast majority of passengers
and dictate where they'll provide service. Dozens of new entrants
have tried to compete and failed, and many of the survivors remain
chronic money losers. The industry lurches from one crisis to the
next--labor discord following fuel price hikes following security
debacles. Consumers constantly grouse about airline service. Leisure
fares have continued to drop, but business fares have surged.</TE>
<TE>   But whether the same scenario is playing itself out in
communications--and whether the 1996 act has been a failure--is still
open to debate. There is little question that deregulation has led to
dramatic changes in the nature of the U.S. telecommunications
industry, but there also is little question that those changes have
unfolded in ways the law's backers and the industry's investors never
expected.</TE>
<TE>   When the reform act was written and passed, it seemed that all
telecommunications services were about to converge. It would not
matter whether one got one's phone service from a local or
long-distance phone company, a cable television or Internet service,
even via satellite. All that was missing was a way for all these
providers to compete with each other on an even keel, ignoring
geographic boundaries, technical specifications or regulatory
traditions.</TE>
<TE>   Three key assumptions underlay the law. The first was that the
lucrative prize for most competitors would be long-distance service.
The drafters reasoned that local phone companies--General Telephone
and the seven Baby Bells created by the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T--would
be so eager to move into long-distance that they would willingly open
their local monopolies to competition to earn the right to offer it
to customers.</TE>
<TE>   The drafters also assumed that the Baby Bells would jump at the
chance to compete for local customers in one another's markets,
triggering even more consumer savings. Finally, they assumed that
falling prices would lead to an explosion in telecommunications
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   All these assumptions turned out to be fundamentally wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The long-distance market, which had been deregulated earlier, was
already experiencing ferocious price competition, with per-minute
rates dropping and profit margins shrinking by the day. Instead of
the Baby Bells wanting to get into long-distance, companies such as
MCI and AT&amp;T were desperate to start providing local service.</TE>
<TE>   But the local phone companies, often supported by their state
public utilities commissions, resisted opening their markets.</TE>
<TE>   "No one anticipated the [Baby Bells'] willingness and ability to
play the game and play it well," said Courtney Quinn, telecom analyst
at Yankee Group, a Boston research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of invading one another's turf as expected, the Baby Bells
simply merged with each other. Within a year after the act's passage,
Texas-based SBC took over Pacific Telesis, the California-based Baby
Bell. Even more disturbing to observers, however, was the 1997 merger
of Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic with Nynex, the Baby Bell serving
neighboring New York and New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a critical moment," said Mark Cooper, research director
for the Washington-based Consumer Federation of America. "There were
10 million people living within 50 to 60 miles of the border between
those companies. It was the ideal place for cross-border
competition."</TE>
<TE>   The deal's approval by the Justice Department's antitrust division
and the Federal Communications Commission heralded a trend of
consolidating local Bell companies. The country had eight local phone
companies in 1996; today it has four--SBC Communications Inc.,
Verizon Communications Inc., BellSouth Corp. and Qwest Communications
International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Before 1996, the largest four local companies served 48% of all
the phone lines in the country; today these four companies serve more
than 85%, according to a study by Consumers Union.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in retrospect the most dangerous assumption behind the
deregulation bill by far was that communications traffic would
mushroom at unprecedented rates.</TE>
<TE>   The overall U.S. market for data, wireless and voice
communications services has grown rapidly since 1996, to an estimated
$277 billion from $164 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1993 there were 10 million wireless subscribers in the country
and revenues were $24 billion," said Blair Levin, a former chief of
staff at the FCC who is at investment firm Legg Mason Inc. "Now there
are 137 million users, and this year they'll pay $75 billion. There's
a lot of gain there."</TE>
<TE>   But even that growth pales in comparison with the wild
expectations of the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "The financial community anticipated a huge increase in demand
that would be never-ending," said Reed E. Hundt, who was FCC chairman
from 1993 to 1997 and is now a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Co. "Many
people knew these growth rates were not sustainable."</TE>
<TE>   But those rates inspired a historic investment spree. From 1996 to
2000, telecom companies assumed more than $1.5 trillion in bank debt
and issued $600 billion in bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "There were too many people throwing too much essentially free
money at the industry," said Tom Evslin, chief executive of ITXC
Corp., a wholesaler of international phone capacity. "At ITXC we had
to beat off the people who wanted to sell us a bond issue when we
didn't need the money."</TE>
<TE>   Industrywide, most of that money was squandered, and the resulting
hangover is exemplified by the WorldCom and Global Crossing
collapses.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the failure can be attributed to financial markets that
funded hundreds of competitors when the market demand [for their
services and equipment] wasn't there to support them," said Yankee
Group's Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   For all that, the Baby Bells have not escaped scot-free. In the
last few days, both SBC and BellSouth have reported sharply lower
profits and dim prospects for the near future. Both cited increasing
competition, among other challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most troublesome trends, experts say, is a decline in
multiple residential phone lines. This was one of the leading growth
factors throughout the 1990s, as homeowners put in second lines to
accommodate dial-up Internet modems or children's phones.</TE>
<TE>   Internet service is now increasingly provided by digital
subscriber lines, or via cable TV companies. And wireless phones have
become ubiquitous substitutes for additional home phone lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Losing the second line is a very big deal for the Bells," Hundt
said. "For them to be relegated to just primary residential line
service is not the future they envisioned."</TE>

<HD>Blake Is Denied Hearing for Bail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appeals court on Tuesday denied actor Robert Blake's request
that a bail hearing be ordered and his murder charge reduced.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, 68, has been held without bail in Men's Central Jail in
downtown Los Angeles since his April 18 arrest in the slaying of his
wife, Bonny Lee Bakley. She was fatally shot in Blake's car near a
Studio City restaurant in May 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys Paul L. Hoffman and Harland W. Braun had asked
the 2nd District Court of Appeal to order the trial judge to conduct
a bail hearing for Blake.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash
ruled that he would set a bail hearing for Blake after a preliminary
hearing is held later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, who starred in the 1970s television series "Baretta," has
pleaded not guilty to murder, two counts of soliciting murder and
conspiracy with the special-circumstance allegation of lying in wait.
He faces life in prison without parole, if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   His attorneys also asked the justices to direct Nash to dismiss
the lying-in-wait allegation by declaring it unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said Tuesday he will ask the state Supreme Court to review
the appellate court's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys accused prosecutors of charging Blake with the
special-circumstance allegation for the sole purpose of keeping him
in custody until trial. They argued that bail should be set, because
Blake is not a flight risk.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Braun said the actor's lengthy pretrial incarceration
leaves the public with the impression that the justice system is
treating his client unfairly. Blake's co-defendant, Earle Caldwell,
was released from jail eight days after their arrest, when Blake
posted his $1 million bail. Caldwell pleaded not guilty to
conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt this was an issue that Judge Nash made a proper ruling
on," said Los Angeles County district attorney's office spokeswoman
Sandi Gibbons.</TE>
<TE>   Because Blake is facing serious charges, "there is always a
possibility that ... bail is not going to hold him in this country,"
she said.</TE>

<HD>Wetlands Project Overcomes Protests</HD>
<DH>Bolsa Chica: Despite opponents who vow to continue a
32-year fight, O.C. supervisors OK a proposal for 388 houses near
Huntington Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest skirmish in a 32-year war, the Orange County Board of
Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously rejected a bid by
environmentalists to derail plans for nearly 400 homes on part of the
Bolsa Chica mesa near Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors, who have historically green-lighted the developer's
proposals, endorsed the Brightwater project on a 4-0 vote.
Environmentalists plan to continue challenging the developer,
Hearthside Homes, which still needs approval from state and federal
agencies before construction begins.</LD>
<LD>   "We expected the board to pave over the mesa," said Paul Arms, a
member of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, which appealed the county
Planning Commission's approval of the project.</LD>
<TE>   Brightwater would have 388 homes, an underground water reservoir
and 28 acres of open space on the 106-acre upper bench of the
two-tier mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy Dunn, executive vice president of Hearthside Homes, said, "We
were very pleased that the board agreed with the Planning
Commission."</TE>
<TE>   The California Coastal Commission is expected to consider the plan
in early 2003, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's vote is the latest twist in the long-running saga of
Bolsa Chica, an unincorporated coastal wetlands area surrounded by
Huntington Beach. Developers originally proposed a marina, a hotel
and as many as 5,700 homes in the late 1970s. That plan and several
others have been approved by county and state agencies, only to be
scaled back after environmental legal challenges.</TE>
<TE>   A History of Paring</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, 4,884 homes were proposed around 1,100 acres
of preserved wetlands. By 1996, the project had shrunk to 3,300
homes. A year later, the state paid $25 million for 880 acres. That
parcel was added to 300 acres that landowner Signal Landmark had
given to the state for wetlands preservation in 1973. The resulting
Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve is the largest wetlands in Southern
California. A separate project to restore tidal flushing to the
wetlands is underway with $100 million from the state and the ports
of Long Beach and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the struggle is over the remaining 230-acre mesa that
overlooks the wetlands. Hearthside wants to build as many as 1,235
homes on the upper and lower parts of the mesa. The fate of the lower
mesa is tied up in the courts. The county Planning Commission
approved the Brightwater plan in May.</TE>
<TE>   The Land Trust appealed, arguing that Hearthside is trying to
piecemeal a larger project on the entire mesa and that the
development would destroy an archeologically significant
8,000-year-old Native American coastal village. The trust also argued
that environmental documents were outdated, planned buffers to
protect sensitive habitat are too small and compensation for the
impact on the environment and traffic is improperly left to the
future.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a special place in Orange County," Alex Mintzer, a Cypress
College professor, told supervisors during the hearing. "We have so
little open space for wildlife and for kids."</TE>
<TE>   Mintzer was among more than two dozen people who testified during
the nearly two-hour hearing.</TE>
<TE>   County staff recommended that the board deny the
environmentalists' attempts to block the plan. "These appeal issues
are without merit," said Thomas B. Mathews, county planning director.</TE>
<TE>   'Enough Is Enough'</TE>
<TE>   Several other speakers, including representatives of the Orange
County Taxpayers' Assn., Building Industry Assn. of Orange County and
the local chapter of Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Enough is enough," Huntington Beach resident Joseph Jeffrey said.
"This project has been studied, revised, compromised and modified
more than any other project in Orange County. It's time to move on."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson said the downsizing of the project helped
make it acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "This development can work, as long as it's done carefully,
thoughtfully and protectively," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said she is hopeful the state panel will approve the project.
"This is the footprint the Coastal Commission wanted us to build,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearthside and Signal Landmark remain in litigation with the
commission over its decision three years ago to bar development on
the lower mesa. That trial is set for Oct. 15 in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists vowed to continue fighting the project and
expressed hope that the state would be able to buy the remaining land
using money from a proposed bond measure expected to be on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely not over," Arms said. "The Bolsa Chica Land
Trust is 100% committed to preserving and restoring the Bolsa Chica
mesa. We'll do whatever it takes."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 14-year-old Reseda boy whose parents were killed in a weekend
traffic accident is facing possible deportation to Guatemala.</LD>
<LD>   Bryan Mendoza, his parents and an aunt came to the U.S. from
Guatemala eight months ago on tourist visas that have expired,
Guatemalan officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles police said Bryan's parents were struck and killed by
a truck about 9 p.m. Sunday as they jaywalked across Riverside Drive
near Fashion Square Sherman Oaks. The driver was not cited, police
said.</LD>
<TE>   Relatives said Santos Mendoza, 41, and Floridalma Estrada, 38,
were custodial workers earning a combined yearly salary of $15,000.
They were trying to catch a bus after work when they were hit, police
said. Now Bryan, who shared a Reseda apartment with his parents and
his aunt, Glenda Gomez, 23, may be unable to stay in Los Angeles,
authorities said. He does not have any relatives in the U.S. who are
legal residents.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the federal Immigration and Naturalization
Service said they usually cannot pair an undocumented, orphaned minor
with a guardian who is also an illegal immigrant.</TE>
<TE>   "Regrettably ... there is a chance that he might face
deportation," said Francisco Arcaute of the INS, though he added that
his office had not yet fully reviewed the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan said his parents came to Los Angeles to offer him a better
life--and he has taken advantage of the opportunities here. He said
he plays on a youth soccer team and has been working on his English
skills in summer school, getting ready for his freshman year at
Reseda High School.</TE>
<TE>   "I've made a lot of friends," he said. "My family would have
wanted me to stay here."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Tuesday, Guatemalan Consul General Fernando
Castillo said he would provide Gomez with legal assistance to try to
keep Bryan in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Arcaute said the case is unusual for immigration officials because
often they are able to match orphaned children with at least one
adult relative who is legally living in the U.S. If Bryan is
deported, the INS will look for a capable guardian to pair him with
in his home country, Arcaute said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan said he has a grandmother and a 21-year-old sister in
Guatemala, but that Los Angeles has become his home.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday evening, about 30 players, coaches and parents from the
North Valley Soccer Lions Boca Junior crowded into the family's
one-bedroom apartment to offer their condolences.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Delia Sandoval said Bryan "is the heart of the
team."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Council passed a motion Tuesday to give
pedestrians a better way to cross Riverside Drive. Along with
improvements to an existing crosswalk, it calls for a Department of
Transportation study to determine if additional improvements are
needed, such as a traffic signal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very long block and there are no stop signs or
streetlights," said Matt Szabo, spokesman for Councilwoman Wendy
Greuel. "The crosswalk is very hard to see.... It's almost impossible
to get across."</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday agreed to begin charging
billboard companies an annual fee to pay for the inventory and
inspection of signs in the city.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Oct. 1, billboard owners will be required to pay the city
$315 per sign each year in exchange for a certificate, which must be
affixed to each billboard.</LD>
<LD>   The program is intended to help city inspectors identify illegal
signs, estimated at about 4,000 citywide.</LD>
<TE>   "This will place the full burden where it belongs: on the
billboard industry," said Councilman Jack Weiss, who pushed for the
fee.</TE>
<TE>   Signs that are deemed illegal will be torn down, Weiss said.</TE>

<HD>Murder Charge Is Upheld</HD>
<DH>Court: Woman who helped police build case against two
others had asked for a dismissal.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura woman who accused authorities of deception and coercion
will stand trial on murder charges for allegedly helping two skinhead
gang members kill a teenage girl in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. ruled Tuesday that
evidence presented at a preliminary hearing suggests Bridget Callahan
stood guard while skinheads David Ziesmer and Michael Bridgeford
stabbed 17-year-old Nichole Hendrix to death in a motel bathroom.</LD>
<LD>   Callahan, 30, Ziesmer, 29, and Bridgeford, 25, all face charges of
first-degree murder and special allegations that they killed Hendrix
during a robbery and kidnapping.</LD>
<TE>   Callahan's lawyer sought to have the charges against her
dismissed, arguing that authorities led her to believe she would not
be prosecuted if she provided details of the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill denied the defense motion, finding there was no misconduct
and no legal basis for the request. The judge further noted that
courts have found nothing unconstitutional about police deception.</TE>
<TE>   "Even assuming an ethical lapse," the judge wrote, "it was not
such as to merit the release of an accused murderer without trial."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Joseph O'Neill, no relation to the judge, further
argued that Callahan's statements were coerced and should not be used
against her.</TE>
<TE>   But in his 10-page ruling, Judge O'Neill concluded that Callahan
voluntarily offered information about the October 1998 slaying.</TE>
<TE>   The judge found no evidence of coercion nor of improper law
enforcement tactics. He ruled that Callahan's Dec. 22, 1999,
statement about the Hendrix killing could be used against her at
trial.</TE>
<TE>   He did suppress her statements after that date, however.</TE>
<TE>   He concluded that a written agreement crafted by a supervisor in
the district attorney's office, and signed by Callahan, implied a
promise of immunity.</TE>
<TE>   The Dec. 22 letter states in part that Callahan, who worked as an
informant, would not begin to assist authorities until they were
satisfied her statements were truthful and that she was "not a
suspect."</TE>
<TE>   During the preliminary hearing, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron
Bamieh testified that authorities knew right after Callahan gave her
statement that she was a suspect. Yet supervisors in his office told
him to allow detectives to "work" her as an informant despite her
culpability, he testified.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, O'Neill found that, based on the agreement,
Callahan was entitled to assume that she could cooperate without
jeopardizing her legal position.</TE>
<TE>   "Accordingly, it would be fundamentally unfair for any of her
statements, actions, or the fruits of her statements or actions to be
used as evidence against her in a homicide prosecution," the judge
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan was ordered back to court on Aug. 6, at which time a
trial date is expected to be set.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for both sides praised Tuesday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "While we don't agree with every single line, we thought it was
reasonable and thoughtful," said state Deputy Atty. Gen. Michael
Katz, whose office took over prosecuting the case at the request of
the district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph O'Neill said the ruling supports his claim that prosecutors
used deceitful tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a slap in the face to their office," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bamieh said the decision supports his earlier assertion that
he and detectives acted properly.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew from the very beginning that everything we did was ethical
and legal," he said.</TE>

<DH>Newhall: The 442 acres, purchased by Santa Clarita and the

<LD>Whitney Canyon, 442 pristine acres in Newhall once considered for an
off-road vehicle park and a housing subdivision, was purchased
Tuesday by the city of Santa Clarita and the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy for public hiking and mountain bike riding.</LD>
<LD>   Developer Ray Watt and his partners in Whitney Ranch Associates
were paid $4.89 million for the land with funds from the state, the
city of Santa Clarita and Proposition 12, the $2.1-billion parks bond
approved by voters in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The property, at the end of San Fernando Road, abuts the western
boundary of the Angeles National Forest.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very excited," said Rick Gould, Santa Clarita's director of
parks, recreation and community services. "One of the city's goals is
to create a greenbelt around the city and this is a huge link in that
system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a gorgeous piece of property. From the ridgeline, there is a
dramatic view of the Santa Clarita Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Recently used for ranching, some old buildings will be removed and
areas cleared in a couple of months to give access to hikers,
mountain bikers and picnickers, said Joseph Edmiston, executive
director of the conservancy. A public hearing will be held to discuss
other possible uses for the canyon, such as an equestrian center.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Los Angeles County officials considered building an
off-road vehicle park in the canyon, a plan that met with stiff
opposition by area residents. Later, Watt considered--and then
decided not to--build houses on the property.</TE>

<HD>Informant's Kin Can Sue Police, Court Rules</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Family of the slain Yorba Linda teen who aided
Brea officers will proceed with claim.</DH>

<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Relatives of a Yorba Linda teenager slain by gang members after
working as an undercover Brea police informant can pursue legal
claims against the department, a state appeals court ruled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana comes
nearly two years after an Orange County judge dismissed the lawsuit,
concluding police were not liable because the teen's mother signed a
waiver consenting to her son's informant role.</LD>
<LD>   Chad MacDonald, 17, agreed to work as an informant for Brea police
in January 1998 after they arrested him on suspicion of
methamphetamine possession.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities agreed not to prosecute him in return for his
services, which included one undercover drug buy.</TE>
<TE>   After police arrested MacDonald a second time with narcotics, they
told him he no longer could work as an informant and would be
charged. Less than two weeks later, MacDonald was strangled at a
Norwalk house frequented by drug dealers.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the teen's death, state lawmakers passed a law
restricting police use of minors as informants.</TE>
<TE>   MacDonald's mother, Cindy, said she was relieved to learn of the
appellate court's decision. She said she signed the waiver under
duress and that Brea police failed to protect her son.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't be happier," she said. "Chad's going to get his day in
court."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Hampel, the attorney representing Brea police, could not
be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>These Students Could Take Us to the Moon</HD>
<DH>A Pasadena institute gives teenagers the chance to work on
real-world computer and math projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small group of high school teenagers lounging on a beat-up sofa
chat about where to get free 7-Eleven Big Gulps, while the rock band
Nirvana blares from the mini-speakers of a computer.</LD>
<LD>   Screen savers featuring teen heartthrobs Natalie Portman and Mandy
Moore pop up on two computers where kids concentrate on what look
like complicated video games.</LD>
<LD>   Signs of teenager-hood abound, but these are not ordinary high
school students. They are cradling college-level computer programming
and math textbooks in their laps. And instead of playing Tomb Raider
or shooting down alien warships, they're making models of robots that
could one day build a colony for humans on the moon.</LD>
<TE>   This is the Jisan Research Institute, a few sparse rooms in a
nondescript, two-story building in Pasadena. Here, 53 high school
students, whose average grade point average is 3.85, prepare for
careers in science and medicine.</TE>
<TE>   During school-year weekends and summers, students ages 13 to 19
work on research projects commissioned by university scientists. The
director of the institute chooses from projects proposed by outside
scientists and graduate students. Companies or universities,
including Caltech and USC, pay for the research costs and sometimes
the tuition fees.</TE>
<TE>   "If a scientist brings us a problem, we'll solve it," said
29-year-old Sanza Kazadi, the director. "Now, that's pretty cool."
(The name Jisan is a combination of his wife's first name, Jisoo, and
his own.)</TE>
<TE>   Since the program started seven years ago, students have published
nine papers in science journals, and they've helped develop a new
technology for facial image recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Some students have presented their findings at science conferences
around the world. Last week four of the students presented a paper
that was accepted at a computer science conference called "Autonomous
Agents and Multi-Agent Systems 2002" in Bologna, Italy. Among the
topics discussed were artificial intelligence and distributive
computing, or the processing power of a massive number of computers
simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   The institute "is different from school," said 16-year-old Michael
Chung of Arcadia High School, who attended the conference in Italy.
"In school, you don't get to do stuff like this. You don't learn
enough to know how to do stuff like this."</TE>
<TE>   Kazadi, who has his undergraduate degree and doctorate from
Caltech, started the nonprofit institute out of his college apartment
with only a card table, a computer and a few students he was
tutoring.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was that kids wanted to learn more than what they were
learning in school," Kazadi said.</TE>
<TE>   While working toward his PhD, Kazadi, a bright-eyed, stocky man,
took a few motivated high school students under his wing. He guided
them on research related to his own thesis on swarm engineering--
creating swarms of relatively simple and inexpensive robots. The
robots, whose forms are yet to be determined, might be used in large
numbers to, for example, erect buildings, patrol oceans during war,
or build a deep-sea generator.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that some of Kazadi's colleagues are still going
through puberty. He is confident about working with teenagers because
of their limitless imaginations.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these guys are even smarter than me," Kazadi said with a
wide smile. "These kids are much more motivated and intelligent than
they are given credit for."</TE>
<TE>   Kazadi said he starts them so young because kids get turned off in
high school.</TE>
<TE>   "Their main experience in science is taking a biology class, a
physics class and a chemistry class," Kazadi said. "This place gives
students a way of validating their training."</TE>
<TE>   The program is a bargain on both ends. The high school students,
who receive no school credit, get the rare opportunity to publish
early, receive lab work training and contribute to groundbreaking
research. Outside scientists get relatively inexpensive labor, and
grad students get teaching experience and finish a lot of their
thesis work that they wouldn't otherwise be able to do alone.</TE>
<TE>   For Kazadi, it helped get a third of his doctoral thesis on swarm
engineering researched and written. He now runs the institute
full-time.</TE>
<TE>   High school participants such as 17-year-old Angelina Ang of
Arcadia High School have found mentors and the opportunity to
experiment with computer programming.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of people I can look up to here," said Ang, wearing
a hot pink T-shirt and glasses. "And I like technological things like
robots. It sounded so cool." She is among 13 girls in the institute,
a number Kazadi wants to increase.</TE>
<TE>   To apply to the institute, students write an essay and interview
with the director. Acceptance is based on grades and interest in
science research. Students must be in eighth grade or high school and
have completed or be in the process of completing a first course in
algebra. Those in high school must have a minimum 3.5 GPA.</TE>
<TE>   Tuition is $325 a month. For students who cannot afford it, Kazadi
tries to find outside funding. Already, Caltech sponsors five
students, and USC funds 10. Six sponsored slots remain open.</TE>
<TE>   Once accepted, students can also join the institute's SAT
preparatory course, peer tutoring, summer advanced math and
electronics classes.</TE>
<TE>   To be eligible to begin research, students work on math problems
independently and present answers in one-on-one sessions with
instructors.</TE>
<TE>   Students also must learn two computer programming languages,
Pascal and C, by reading the textbooks and practicing on the
computers. They consult an on-site instructor if they have questions.
Then they can pick a research group based on their interests.</TE>
<TE>   This year the two projects are swarm engineering and evolutionary
design, a computer design system that would base mechanical designs
on the evolution of natural biological life forms.</TE>
<TE>   Kazadi said his main goal is to train young people early to help
alleviate the scientist drought in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "If the flow of scientists stops from abroad, America will
collapse," Kazadi said.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of its ability to stay cutting edge in science and
engineering, we simply don't have the people."</TE>
<TE>   Already, he has plans for his students' next research project:
using Jupiter's powerful magnetic field to beam energy to the planets
in the solar system.</TE>
<TE>   "You could power any spacecraft back and forth with just the power
of Jupiter," Kazadi said dreamily. "That would be pretty neat.
Already, some of our kids are starting to think about it."</TE>

<LD>Deep in the Los Padres National Forest, where plunging canyons meet
towering sandstone pinnacles, the first in a new generation of
California condors toddles around a small cave, flapping its stubby
wings.</LD>

<TE>   The chick, the first condor brooded and hatched in the wild in 18
years, represents the most significant breakthrough in the 23-year,
$35-million effort to save North America's largest bird from
extinction.</TE>
<TE>   "My high point was the hatching of that chick, but it keeps me up
at night," said Bruce Palmer, coordinator of the condor project for
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "It's the yin and yang of the
condor dilemma."</TE>
<TE>   For the hundreds of biologists, volunteers and academics who have
spent years trying to keep condors a living symbol of America's
primordial past, success has often been followed by disaster and
disappointment. But even those accustomed to expecting the worst are
feeling a bit giddy these days.</TE>
<TE>   After the first chick hatched in April, another was born in May
and a third in June. California condors, once largely confined to
rugged areas of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, now roam Big Sur
and large swaths of Arizona, including the Grand Canyon. They have
also alighted in the San Bernardino Mountains near Crestline and
soared with hang gliders over the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In September, six condors will be freed in Baja California, with
later releases scheduled for New Mexico and Pinnacles National
Monument near Salinas. Plans also call for freeing condors near
historic foraging areas of Riverside and San Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the condor population has grown from a low of 22 birds
to 205, with 44 eggs laid since January. Condors are now bred in
Boise, Idaho, the Los Angeles and San Diego zoos and, beginning next
year, the Oregon Zoo in Portland. The overall goal is two populations
of 150 birds each in California and Arizona by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   "We have hit some critical landmarks," said Mike Mace, curator of
birds at the San Diego Wild Animal Park and a member of the
California Condor Recovery Team. "We rescued a species from
extinction and we have bred birds in captivity who are now raising
their own offspring."</TE>
<TE>   The California condor, weighing up to 25 pounds with wings
stretching nearly 10 feet across, once shared a continent with woolly
mammoths and saber-toothed cats.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say they are intelligent, highly social and intensely
curious animals, more akin to primates than birds. But these hulking,
red-eyed vultures remained largely a mystery to scientists in the
early days of the recovery program.</TE>
<TE>   New Approach</TE>
<TE>   They often misread behavior patterns and underestimated the threat
of urban surroundings. Birds were released only to be recaptured
after landing in schoolyards or on power poles. Others died of lead
poisoning, electrocution and collisions.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the hands-off approach was replaced by an intensive
management style that left little to chance, creating a sort of avian
welfare state where even the eggs were coddled.</TE>
<TE>   Eggs are kept in state-of-the-art incubators. Chicks are monitored
by hidden cameras in nesting boxes. Teams of biologists track the
released condors' every move. Condors that get too close to humans
are recaptured for behavior modification. Calf carcasses are supplied
to keep them from eating poisoned carrion, and every six months the
birds are tested for lead.</TE>
<TE>   "As they recover, we can take them out of intensive care," said
U.S. Interior Secretary Gale Norton. "We still don't have huge
numbers and we need to be careful. But all the trends now are
positive."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all the recent successes, a self-sustaining condor
population is nowhere in sight. And with no concentrated effort to
replace lead bullets, which condors frequently ingest from carcasses,
extinction would be certain without the avian nanny state.</TE>
<TE>   "You can get a lot of birds out there, but that's not success,"
said Noel Snyder, one of the early leaders of the program and now its
chief critic. "You don't just throw birds back into the same
environment they couldn't live in before. If you haven't solved the
lead issue, they will dwindle down to nothing again. Then what have
you accomplished?"</TE>
<TE>   Victims of Change</TE>
<TE>   Condors have never been plentiful, and as early as 1890
naturalists were calling it a "doomed bird."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next three decades, they vanished from much of Southern
California, including the Santa Ynez and Santa Monica mountains,
according to a 1953 study by zoologist Carl Koford.</TE>
<TE>   Their disappearance was tied to a changing landscape. Condors,
which can live more than 50 years and soar to 15,000 feet, once
feasted on the thousands of cattle that died each year on sprawling
ranches. But as crops replaced cows, hunters shot and poisoned the
birds, collectors stole their eggs and cowboys sometimes lassoed them
for sport.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the Sespe Condor Sanctuary was established in 1947 on
37,000 acres near Fillmore. In 1953, it became illegal to kill or
capture condors and, in 1965, the Audubon Society hired John Borneman
as the first "condor warden."</TE>
<TE>   Borneman monitored the birds, fed them frozen carcasses and kept
out the egg poachers.</TE>
<TE>   "You could get $300 for a condor egg," he said. "They were in such
demand they would paint a swan's egg green and pass it off as a
condor egg."</TE>
<TE>   Working without modern radio transmitters, early naturalists spent
weeks in the wilderness chasing down condors.</TE>
<TE>   Condor biologist Janet Hamber once watched as a colleague climbed
into a nest to measure a condor chick.</TE>
<TE>   "They were trying to put the chick in a container, but it was too
big," she said. "Then I saw them lay the bird down and try to give it
water, but it had died. There was too much stress on it."</TE>
<TE>   Hamber also witnessed one old matriarch's slow death from lead
poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched her plod up a trail, get to the top and take off," she
said. "She landed near a calf carcass. I thought she was all right
because she was eating big pieces of flesh. They later trapped her
and found she had major lead poisoning."</TE>
<TE>   Defining Moment</TE>
<TE>   By 1982, there were just a handful of condors remaining. Plans
were made to bring the chicks and eggs into a captive breeding
program at the Los Angeles and San Diego zoos. But when seven birds
suddenly died and others showed high levels of lead in their blood,
Fish and Wildlife decided to capture all the wild condors.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists opposed the plan, fearing that the birds would
remain in captivity and their habitat lost. After a court battle, in
which Fish and Wildlife was represented by its then-associate
solicitor Gale Norton, the government prevailed. In 1985, the capture
program began in earnest.</TE>
<TE>   Using cannon-powered nets and pit traps, biologists began
capturing the condors. One day in 1987, Hamber spotted Adult Condor
9, or AC9, the last wild condor. He was standing near a calf carcass.
She considered not calling a trapper.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat there and thought, 'Nobody would ever know. How would they
know?' Tomorrow was Easter Sunday. How would they get a crew
together?" she asked herself. In the end, Hamber drove to a gas
station and called the trapper, who arrived at 4:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "They got AC9 with a net," she recalled. "It was agonizing to
watch him walk up to it. There were puffs of smoke from the cannons
and someone yelled 'Yahoo!' and I said, 'How can you be happy about
this?' I looked at AC9 and said, 'I'm sorry.' I said if the zoos
didn't eventually release those birds, I would."</TE>
<TE>   When Borneman heard there were no more California condors in the
wild, he shut his office door and cried.</TE>
<TE>   After thousands of years, the condor had finally vanished from the
skies. But then scientists set to work to breed them in zoos.</TE>
<TE>   A technique called double clutching was discovered to get multiple
eggs. Condors lay one egg and raise one chick every two years. But if
the egg is removed, they lay another within 30 days. If that one is
removed, a condor will often lay a third egg. The eggs were placed in
incubators and the adults given phony eggs to tend. When the eggs
were close to hatching, they were returned to the nests so the adults
could raise the chicks.</TE>
<TE>   The practice goes on today in a remote corner of the Los Angeles
Zoo, off limits to all but condor staff.</TE>
<TE>   Signs urging "Quiet" hang everywhere. Shoes must be dipped in
disinfectant before one steps into the incubator rooms. Eggs are
handled with rubber gloves and sterile towels. If room temperatures
fluctuate, alarms go off.</TE>
<TE>   Constant Watch</TE>
<TE>   "These are California condors and we can't afford to lose any,"
said animal keeper Michael Clark, who watches each chick on a
television monitor. If an adult gets rough with a baby, the chick is
quickly removed. Adults have killed chicks.</TE>
<TE>   Double clutching has meant a surplus of chicks and not enough
adults to raise them. The solution has been to use puppets resembling
adult condors to play parent.</TE>
<TE>   Clark puts the puppet on, hides behind a drape and nudges the
chick to eat its chopped mice. He also preens and strokes the bird.</TE>
<TE>   "We push for as many parent-reared birds as possible and try to
avoid puppet-rearing, because the chicks tend to be more confident
without it," he said. Before their release, young condors spend time
in large pens with "mentor birds" who show the juveniles how to
behave.</TE>
<TE>   When they are mature enough, the condors are fitted with radio
transmitters, given a number and released in the Ventana Wilderness
of Big Sur, the Vermilion Cliffs in Arizona or the Sespe Condor
Sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   "It still blows me away," Clark said. "They look like they come
from another world. I don't think anyone who has ever seen such an
amazing animal up close would want to see it die out."</TE>
<TE>   When the birds are released, biologists from the Fish and Wildlife
Service take over daily management.</TE>
<TE>   Ground Zero</TE>
<TE>   Ground zero for the Ventura County team is an old ranch house deep
in the Los Padres National Forest. Here they spend up to 10 days at a
time in spartan conditions, sleeping in tiny cubicles and on call 24
hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   Every morning they are dispatched to monitor condor nests, track
their 35 birds, scour area ranches for dead calf donations or chase
birds from oil pads.</TE>
<TE>   Crises can erupt. Sometimes condors won't eat or they simply
disappear. A week after the first chick was born, its father dipped
his head in a puddle of oil and brushed the chick with it. Both birds
survived, but not before causing panic all the way up to the Interior
secretary's office.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, Mike Barth stood atop a 4,000-foot ridge
pointing an antenna toward the sky. A condor appeared overhead, then
four more. The biologist's transmitter sounded a series of staccato
beeps.</TE>
<TE>   "Condor!" he yelled, scribbling the number of each bird, the time
and direction of flight in a weathered notebook. "We try to account
for all birds every day, but sometimes you can't."</TE>
<TE>   More condors dipped over the ridge, their black wings, orange
heads and white under markings stark against the deep blue sky. One
perched on a rocky outcropping while AC9--the last condor captured in
the wild and released in May--landed in a gnarled black walnut tree.</TE>
<TE>   With each sighting, the adrenaline rose. Biologists strung across
mountaintops from Fillmore to the San Fernando Valley radioed in
condor sightings and identification numbers. Despite a long day of
near 100-degree heat, their passion for condors never cooled.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in this program get so into it," said biologist
Bronwyn Davey as the sun set over the golden hills. "The condors
become like friends. You get to know them individually, get to know
their personalities."</TE>
<TE>   Back at the ranch house, conversation rarely strayed from the
quirks, habits and general plight of the birds.</TE>
<TE>   The group discussed the continuing threat posed by lead and the
views of program critic Noel Snyder, who thinks all the birds should
be brought back into captivity until the environment is made safe.</TE>
<TE>   "Snyder's idea is too extreme," said Allan Mee, a researcher from
the San Diego Zoo studying condor nesting and parenting behavior. "I
understand his viewpoint, though. In most introductions [back into
the wild], you don't start until the danger is out of the
environment."</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe that unless the lead problem is solved, we won't be
able to maintain a wild, free-flying condor population," said Bruce
Palmer, program coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   There are serious efforts to produce non-lead ammunition. Steel
shot has replaced lead for hunting waterfowl. And advertising
campaigns are underway to persuade hunters to bury the innards of
animals killed with lead bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Hope for Future</TE>
<TE>   Given the threats, rigorous management of the California condor
will likely continue. Scientists hope a new generation raised in the
wild will overcome the obstacles it faces and once again soar over
its ancient habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "The skies are different for me now because I have seen condors,"
said Oliver Ryder, a geneticist at the San Diego Zoo who works with
the birds. "Will it be OK for the condor? It will take a few
generations to make a prognosis. Can people make a difference?
Absolutely."</TE>

<HD>4,000 Acres Set Aside for El Toro Park</HD>
<DH>Land use: Developers will bid on the other 15% of the base
for retail space, sites for 3,400 homes. The Irvine Co. won't be
among them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of negotiations, Irvine and the federal government
unveiled a plan Tuesday that calls for developers to create one of
the country's largest urban parks at the mothballed El Toro Marine
base in exchange for the right to build there.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would set aside 4,000 acres--about 85% of the available
land at the base--for sports fields, museums, wildlife corridors and
other public uses, in keeping with the city's vision for a "Great
Park."</LD>
<LD>   The Navy announced that it would sell the base to the highest
bidder after Orange County voters in March rejected a proposed
airport at the site. That prompted critics to warn that tens of
thousands of homes would be built and that the promised park would
vanish.</LD>
<TE>   The land will still be auctioned off to developers, but building
will be restricted to clusters on the remaining 738 acres of the
base. Permits will be granted for 3,400 homes and 2.9 million square
feet of retail space.</TE>
<TE>   The developers will have to turn over the rest of the land to the
park as a condition of sale. They will also be required to fund the
development and maintenance of the park. Under the plan, the Navy
will pay to clean up any remaining hazardous waste from military
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "We will create one of America's greatest metropolitan parks right
here in the center of Orange County," said Irvine Mayor Larry Agran.
"[It] will be developed and maintained in perpetuity with private
dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Even as pro-airport advocates continue to press their case in
lawsuits, Navy officials said their decision is final and that they
will move forward with the plan even if the March vote is overturned
in court.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed park would be four times the size of San Francisco's
Golden Gate Park. Irvine officials said it would be developed over 10
years, but parts could be open to the public by mid-2005.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a dream come true," said Michael Pinto, president of the
Laguna Canyon Foundation. He and other conservationists said they
were delighted by the setting aside of 1,200 acres to complete a "sea
to sage" wildlife corridor stretching from Crystal Cove State Park to
Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Development industry analysts say bidders will likely line up for
an opportunity to own some of the El Toro land--even if it means they
have to put most of the acreage they buy--and millions of additional
dollars--into the park.</TE>
<TE>   "Availability of land in central Orange County is at a premium,"
said Richard Gollis, principal of the Concord Group, a Newport Beach
real estate consultancy for builders of master-planned communities.
"This is flat land with fantastic access between the toll roads and
the freeways, and there is a lot of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Buyers would also have development rights already in place,
fast-tracking the approval process and allowing construction to start
right away, thus saving them millions of dollars on land-use studies
and potential lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   As much as half the residential development would be mixed among
shops and offices in a proposed transit village, which would include
a new Metrolink station near the Irvine Spectrum. Nearby would be a
39-acre expansion of the Irvine Auto Center and 117 acres zoned for
research and development facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Gollis said companies nationwide have expressed interest in the
base and he expects a lively bidding war after Irvine completes the
process of annexing the land from the county about a year from now.</TE>
<TE>   The base will be carved into at least six parcels, each auctioned
off separately by the Navy. But the Navy will entertain bids from
single buyers wishing to acquire the entire site.</TE>
<TE>   One development firm that is not interested--to the surprise of
many--is the Irvine Co. The land is adjacent to its Irvine Spectrum
complex, as well as its proposed 12,000-home Northern Sphere Project.
Industry analysts had predicted that the company would buy any El
Toro land that came on the market, if only to keep competition away.</TE>
<TE>   Yet company officials say they will sit the auction out.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not interested in bidding on the land," said company
spokesman Richard Elbaum, who declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past year, the company has announced its plan for
building out the remaining land it has in Orange County. Those
familiar with its operations say its executives want to leave their
legacy at that.</TE>
<TE>   Affordable-housing advocates, who hoped more units would be set
aside for low-income workers, expressed some disappointment with the
plan. The proposal requires one quarter of the homes built to be
"affordable."</TE>
<TE>   But under current guidelines, such homes could still cost in the
high $200,000s.</TE>
<TE>   "They should be building homes for the people who work in
non-teaching jobs at UC Irvine, the people who staff the hotels and
visitors services," said Allen Baldwin, executive director of the
nonprofit Orange County Community Housing Corp., who predicted that
few, if any, of the homes built at El Toro will be in range for those
workers.</TE>
<TE>   And some environmentalists who have done battle with the city over
other projects are skeptical about whether Irvine will be able to
deliver.</TE>
<TE>   "They've pulled the rug out from under people before, and I am
concerned as to how the other shoe will drop in this deal," said
Robert Caustin, executive director of Defend the Bay, which has filed
lawsuits to block other developments around El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   But others, like Pinto of Laguna Canyon Foundation, were ecstatic
about the open space that will be preserved and applaud the plan as a
happy ending to their decade-long fight against the traffic and
pollution they say an airport would have brought.</TE>
<TE>   The park will also include 769 acres of meadows, a 164-acre sports
park, a 151-acre "exposition area" that could be used by cultural
institutions to build museums or libraries, 307 acres of agricultural
land, and 582 acres of public golf courses, a cemetery and veteran's
memorial, and a "commercial recreation" district. The plan also calls
for setting aside 276 acres for university purposes, land where Cal
State Fullerton hopes to build a satellite campus.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the base is on county land. Irvine intends to annex the
entire base and has been taking the lead in planning development of
the site.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials say they will start posting for-sale signs on the
parcels and give prospective buyers tours the middle of next year. A
30- to 60-day bidding process over the Internet will follow. About
the same time, Irvine will be completing the annexation process. The
Navy will make the sale official once the annexation is complete.</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Man, 39, Fatally Hit by Forklift at Naval Base</HD>
<DH>Accident: He had been driving the equipment shortly before
another employee took over. The Navy and OSHA have opened
investigations.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 39-year-old longshoreman from Santa Paula died Tuesday morning
after being struck by a forklift at Naval Base Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   According to base officials, Richard Lopez Jr., a contract worker
for Stevedoring Services of America, had been using a forklift to
load and unload military cargo on Wharf 3 from the motor vessel
Greenpoint.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly before the accident, he got off the forklift and someone
else began driving it, base officials said. Lopez was struck by the
forklift about 8:45 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   Base emergency response teams arrived shortly after the incident,
but Lopez was declared dead at the scene. The Ventura County
coroner's office said Lopez died of multiple crushing injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Naval Criminal Investigative Services and the federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration are investigating. Base spokeswoman
Sarah Burford said it was unclear how long Lopez had worked at the
base.</TE>
<TE>   Such industrial accidents are uncommon, but not unheard of, in
Ventura County. In April 2001, a 79-year-old farm labor contractor
was killed after being run over by a forklift driven by another
employee. And in December 2000, an Oxnard man was killed when a
tractor he was riding flipped on a horse trail in Santa Rosa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not real common, but we do see this on occasion, especially
in ports and construction sites where there's a lot of activity and a
lot of noise," said Dean Fryer, a spokesman for Cal / OSHA.
"Sometimes a person operating a piece of equipment doesn't see a
person."</TE>
<TE>   Burford said the naval base was providing grief counseling for
Lopez's family.</TE>

<HD>Alhambra, S. Pasadena Playing Chicken Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alhambra and South Pasadena agree that traffic on Fremont Avenue, a
major north-south artery linking the cities, is pretty awful. That's
about all they agree on.</LD>
<LD>   Events last week were a reminder of the intractable nature of the
problem--and of the prickly relationship of two cities at odds over
plans to extend the Long Beach Freeway. But first, a little history.</LD>
<LD>   It's three years since the first battle of Fremont Avenue
backfired and blew up in Alhambra's face.</LD>
<TE>   In July 1999, Alhambra blocked off a portion of Fremont in an
attempt to keep southbound traffic from South Pasadena out of
Alhambra. South Pasadenans saw the move as a way to punish their city
for its more than 30-year opposition to extending the 710 Freeway, a
longtime Alhambra goal.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of diverting traffic elsewhere, the tactic left cars
idling on Alhambra streets, suffocating local businesses. After three
days, the barricades came down.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the battle of Fremont was rejoined, only this time it
was South Pasadena's turn to try to limit traffic on Fremont.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing July 17, the City Council considered 11 options on
how to get traffic off Fremont, a residential street, and onto wider,
commercially zoned Fair Oaks Avenue, which also runs north-south. One
option, labeled "most promising" by engineers, essentially called for
blocking off Fremont to divert traffic onto Huntington Drive and
eventually to Fair Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   When Alhambra officials showed up for the hearing, they didn't
mention the first battle of Fremont. And they didn't offer any
friendly advice, only brief remarks about how negative changes in
traffic might force a response. Read: lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   South Pasadena residents spoke up, saying their quiet streets
would become detours for motorists. Business owners near Fremont and
Huntington said they worried that the changes might hurt them.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, when the public comment period ended, residents on
both sides agreed Fremont should remain open. The council postponed a
decision on the Fremont project, agreeing to schedule another public
session in August.</TE>
<TE>   From Alhambra's perspective, the roadblock stems from South
Pasadena's continued opposition to extending the 710 Freeway, which
now dead-ends at Valley Boulevard in Alhambra, to the 210 Freeway.
This would entail cutting through South Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   From South Pasadena's perspective, the problem is Alhambra's
insistence that the freeway be built, though it has suggested the 710
could be extended to Mission Drive in Alhambra.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Alhambra and South Pasadena residents frequently find
themselves in each other's cities. Staff members from both cities say
they frequently talk to each other, always amicably. But other than
mutual-aid agreements, which allow emergency crews to respond to
incidents within each other's borders, public works projects continue
to follow a different track.</TE>
<TE>   Alhambra is spending $10 million to widen parts of Fremont in
anticipation of the freeway. The Fremont-Huntington intersection is
one of several traffic spots South Pasadena hopes to improve with a
$12-million state grant.</TE>
<TE>   When asked, most city officials try to put a good face on
Alhambra-South Pasadena relations by touting each other as good,
cooperative neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   But not Alhambra Vice Mayor Mark Paulson. "There is no
cooperation," said Paulson, who was mayor during the first battle of
Fremont.</TE>
<TE>   Still, at last week's meeting, civility prevailed. Alhambra
Councilman Paul Talbot credited the South Pasadena City Council for
trying to resolve the Fremont issue amicably. Talbot suggested that
the council consider extending the 710 at least to Huntington Drive.
"I thought I was going to get skewered," Talbot later said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than offering a sharp stick, the council extended an olive
branch. Could the two councils meet to discuss the issue? wondered
South Pasadena City Councilman Michael Cacciotti.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," Talbot said.</TE>
<TE>   But afterward, Talbot called the Fremont options a "Band-Aid." And
after the Alhambra city attorney vaguely threatened a lawsuit, South
Pasadena Mayor Harry Knapp suggested that if Alhambra was serious
about relieving traffic, it should review the timing of a traffic
light at Fremont and Main Street. His constituents applauded.</TE>
<TE>   For now, South Pasadena engineers will continue searching for ways
to send traffic from Fremont over to Fair Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to break the habits of a lifetime without creating a
political or litigation issue," said Franklin Sherkow, vice president
of the firm hired by South Pasadena to try to fix Fremont.</TE>
<TE>   One low-budget solution, he suggested, would be to educate drivers
by erecting signs--"Be a good neighbor. Take Huntington"--along
Fremont Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion hung in the air for a moment, and then came the
audience's answer.</TE>
<TE>   They laughed.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Pushes to Include Valley Secession Costs on Ballot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secession opponents moved Tuesday to ensure that the Nov. 5 ballot
includes the price tag of breaking off the San Fernando Valley from
the city of Los Angeles. But supporters of a Valley city labeled that
effort an attempt to scare voters.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn, who is leading the anti-secession campaign,
appealed to the Board of Supervisors to draft the secession ballot
measure so that it reflects the annual payments that a Valley city
would have to make to Los Angeles. The board will take up the matter
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor said he believes that the financial information is
legally required to be on the ballot.</LD>
<TE>   "We think, like any other ballot initiative that people vote on
... there ought to be some discussion of the fiscal impact," Hahn
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the mayor's request, the Los Angeles City Council voted 12 to 0
Tuesday to support a ballot description of secession that includes
the financial effect. The mayor and council are expected to seek
similar language for the Hollywood secession measure, which is on the
same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to know without a shadow of doubt what it's going to
cost to break apart Los Angeles," Councilwoman Janice Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   A state commission charged with overseeing the secession proposal
has said that a Valley city would have to pay $127.1 million to Los
Angeles in the first year after a breakup to make up for lost tax
revenue. That amount would decrease by 5% each year for 20 years,
officials said. A Hollywood city would have to pay Los Angeles $21.4
million the first year, with the amount also steadily dropping.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Calemine, executive director of the Local Agency Formation
Commission, said he has no comment on the ballot-language issue.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors is expected to vote Thursday to formally
place the cityhood measures on the ballot. Supervisors Gloria Molina
and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said they will ask their colleagues to
require the county counsel's office to include the financial
information on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason to hide the information," Burke said. "I would
think everyone would be for disclosure."</TE>
<TE>   Molina said she was surprised that LAFCO did not include the cost
in the language it submitted to the board.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to make any sort of informed decision ... I think
you should know [the cost]," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close said the council action is
a last-minute effort to muddy the water.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an attempt by the city of Los Angeles to mislead the
voters," said Close, who is heading the Valley secession movement.</TE>
<TE>   Close and other secessionists say the payments would not involve a
tax increase. They also point out that the payments would be required
because the Valley and Hollywood now contribute more in tax revenues
than the regions receive in the value of city services. In that
sense, secessionists say, Valley and Hollywood residents are already
making the payments.</TE>
<TE>   "Their whole strategy is to falsely scare the voters," Close said
of Hahn and the council. "They have no positive message."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, Hahn said there are ways to improve municipal
services other than breaking apart the city. To that end, the mayor
issued an executive order requiring the city departments' general
managers to meet quarterly with the 38 neighborhood councils. Hahn
also said that those panels would have input in next year's city
budget.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the mayor picked up other allies Tuesday with an
announcement that the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund would oppose Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit organization said a Valley split would probably not
help Latinos and could dilute their political power. It cited
concerns that worker protections and rent control would be vulnerable
and questioned whether a Valley city would support immigrant
rights--accepting identity cards issued by the Mexican Consulate, for
example, as Los Angeles does.</TE>

<HD>Hotel Owner to Stand Trial in Deadly Fire</HD>
<DH>Courts: The North Hills resident faces charges of murder,
arson and fraud. His stepfather, who was also accused in the blaze,
is released after hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The owner of a Hollywood hotel that was destroyed by a fire last year
in which two people were killed was ordered Tuesday to stand trial on
charges of murder, arson and insurance fraud.</LD>
<LD>   His stepfather, also accused in the blaze, was set free at the end
of the pair's preliminary hearing. Citing insufficient evidence, Los
Angeles Superior Court Judge Carlos Velarde ruled that 68-year-old
Joseph Donald Lewellen of North Hills had no financial stake in the
Palomar Hotel.</LD>
<LD>   But the judge said there is probable cause that Juan Jose Ortiz,
45, of North Hills was responsible for the Aug. 16 fire.</LD>
<TE>   Ortiz and Lewellen, were not in the hotel at 5473 Santa Monica
Blvd. when it burned. Authorities believe that Ortiz's brother,
Arturo Ortiz, who lived in and managed the hotel, set the fire. He
died in the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Tenant Norma Galindo, 38, also died when she fell from a
fourth-floor window just after passing her two small children to
rescuers.</TE>
<TE>   During the 20-day preliminary hearing, prosecutors presented
evidence that Juan Ortiz stood to gain $900,000 in insurance claims.
He took out a policy in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Arson investigators testified that eight plastic gasoline
containers were strategically placed in various unoccupied rooms.
Arturo Ortiz was wearing two layers of clothing when his body was
found. He had been caught off guard when the fire began prematurely,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jean Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   Daly said Juan Ortiz and his brother planned the fire to rid
themselves of the property, which faced $500,000 in repairs mandated
by the city Building and Safety Department.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a money pit," Daly said. "It was swallowing up money,
and money had to be put in it."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz's attorney, Charles L. Lindner, said his client had no
reason to torch the hotel, because it was profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Lindner said Juan Ortiz was offered between $600,000 and $700,000
for the property, but didn't want to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palomar Hotel was a moneymaking engine that just needed a few
repairs," Lindner said.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz is being held without bail pending his arraignment on Aug.
6.</TE>

<HD>Avila's Cell Use at Odds With Alibi</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alejandro Avila's cell phone and credit card records indicate he was
in south Orange County--near the area where 5-year-old Samantha
Runnion's body was discovered--in the hours after her kidnapping, a
law enforcement source said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The records appear to contradict Avila's assertion that he was at
Ontario Mills mall in San Bernardino County at the time Samantha was
abducted just after 6 p.m. July 15, the source said.</LD>
<LD>   Avila, who is charged with kidnapping, sexually assaulting and
murdering the Stanton girl, maintains he had nothing to do with
Samantha's abduction. Avila's mother said that she called him the
night of the kidnapping and that he told her he was at the mall.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities are trying to piece together the hours between
Samantha's abduction the evening of July 15 and the discovery of her
body the next afternoon off a mountain road in Cleveland National
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   A source familiar with the investigation said Tuesday that
preliminary tests of fibers found on Samantha's body matched fibers
found in two cars Avila had access to: a green Ford Thunderbird owned
by Avila and another car that belongs to a relative. Detectives were
unsure Tuesday what the fibers are.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that Samantha was bound, sources said, but
detectives believe she scratched her attacker. Preliminary tests of
DNA samples taken from Samantha's body match a DNA sample taken from
Avila, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement authorities can track a cell phone user's
movements through data left at nearby cell sites. According to the
Federal Communications Commission, many mobile phones manufactured
after 1998 store a record of the local cellular site and base station
used for calls.</TE>
<TE>   'A Cleaner Trail'</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately for us, if he hadn't used his cell phone or his
credit cards, he would have left a cleaner trail," a source close to
the investigation said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities would not disclose details of the phone records, but
Avila's mother said that when she called her son's cell phone at 8 or
9 p.m. July 15, she heard the sounds of airplanes. Ontario Mills mall
is near Ontario International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Avila will enter a plea in Orange County Superior Court next
month. Special circumstances filed along with the murder charges will
allow the district attorney's office to seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said he will meet with
his staff and Samantha's family about whether to seek death and
described the case as his office's priority.</TE>
<TE>   Avila said in an interview with The Times that detectives told him
they had found fibers on Samantha's body that linked him to the
slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Blood Sample Taken</TE>
<TE>   Officers also took a sample of Avila's blood and photographed a
scratch on his leg, he said. Police believe Samantha scratched her
abductor in a struggle to escape.</TE>
<TE>   They said the assailant held Samantha for several hours after the
kidnapping, sexually assaulting and eventually asphyxiating her
sometime July 16.</TE>
<TE>   Her nude body was found in the open off a mountain road, posed in
a way that the FBI said amounted to a "calling card" and a warning
that the killer would strike again.</TE>
<TE>   Avila said that he tried to cooperate with officers during
questioning Thursday but demanded an attorney when their tone turned
hostile.</TE>
<TE>   His family blamed a vindictive former girlfriend for pointing
police in Avila's direction.</TE>

<HD>McDonald's OKs Higher Pay at LAX</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under pressure from city officials to respond to complaints alleging
that they violated labor laws, four McDonald's restaurants at Los
Angeles International Airport have agreed to amend their concession
contracts.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald's representatives told the City Council's Commerce,
Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday that the
restaurants would voluntarily pay their workers the city's living
wage and comply with LAX's new contractor responsibility program,
both of which were enacted after the current contracts were signed.</LD>
<LD>   Restaurant representatives said they would work to amend existing
contracts with the city agency that operates the airport to pay the
living wage--$7.99 an hour with benefits and $9.24 an hour without
benefits. The company is not required to pay the city's living wage
because its contract with the airport agency predates the law's
implementation in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   McDonald's hopes to have the living wage in place at its airport
franchises by Sept. 1, said Jeanne Hardemion-Kemp, the company's
community affairs manager in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   After a hearing, the commerce committee recommended that the
Airport Commission pursue the changes, but that the contract
extension shouldn't be formalized until after a six-month trial
period.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I would be interested in considering a contract extension,
I would like to see how things work out with this contract amendment
in place," Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said. The City Council would
review any contract extension granted to McDonald's by the Airport
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The McDonald's franchises at LAX had been negotiating a three-year
contract extension with the airport agency. The current contract
expires in 2005. But a nonprofit worker advocacy group asked that the
extension be denied, alleging that McDonald's employees at LAX suffer
dangerous working conditions and intimidation by managers.</TE>
<TE>   The company has franchises in terminals 1, 5 and 7 and in the
Bradley International Terminal.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Secretly Tests Water at 2 Sites</HD>
<DH>Health: Legionnaires' outbreak prompts Good Samaritan to
examine county, Times buildings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN and EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good Samaritan Hospital, upset by publicity about a Legionnaires'
disease outbreak at its facility, secretly tested water from the Los
Angeles Times and the Los Angeles County administration buildings and
reportedly found Legionella pneumophila bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   The county Department of Health Services, which received
notification Monday of the unsolicited tests, said the public and
visitors to both buildings have nothing to worry about because
Legionella is common in water supplies and its presence does not
necessarily increase the risk of contracting the respiratory disease.</LD>
<LD>   "This information is not surprising or cause for alarm," Dr.
Thomas Garthwaite, health services director, wrote to county
supervisors. He added that no further testing or decontamination is
required at either building.</LD>
<TE>   County supervisors, however, ordered tests at their building,
county hospitals and The Times. They also criticized Good Samaritan
for the water testing. Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky dubbed it a public
relations "stunt."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they've proven a damn thing other than their own
stupidity," Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina said the hospital's action was an example
"of someone who was still trying to put the blame on someone."</TE>
<TE>   Between January and June, nine patients became ill with
Legionnaires' acquired at Good Samaritan. Two of those later died,
but hospital officials say the deaths were unrelated to
Legionnaires'.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the hospital and county health officials were
faulted by county supervisors for failing to disclose the hospital
outbreak to the public until The Times inquired about an anonymous
tip.</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan officials Tuesday said a hospital employee
collected sink water samples from public restrooms at The Times'
headquarters downtown and the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration on
July 9 and sent them to a certified laboratory in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   The two sites were selected because "they are the work sites for
people who were directly involved in this issue," according to a
letter from hospital President and Chief Executive Andrew Leeka to
county health officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, we would like the public to understand this problem is
not one unique to Good Samaritan hospital, and that we are working
with you, along with others, to prevent the spread of disease from
the bacteria," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Leeka added that the hospital had suffered from "sensationalized
media coverage," which left the impression that the hospital did not
respond appropriately.</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan spokeswoman Mari Bregman said the tests were not
conducted for publicity. The health department, not the hospital,
released the results.</TE>
<TE>   The bacteria is so widespread, Leeka has said, that during the
outbreak, the hospital also treated several people who acquired
Legionnaires' in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jonathan Fielding, the county public health director, said
there is a "big difference" between finding Legionella in the water
and discovering an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that one finds it even in a hospital is not necessarily
grounds to do major work," Fielding said. But when people become
infected, experts recommend "aggressive measures to control the
outbreak," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Times spokeswoman Martha Goldstein said the newspaper is
conducting its own evaluation and consulting with an
infectious-disease specialist "to see if there's any danger to our
employees or whether any action is merited."</TE>
<TE>   She called the water test results uncorroborated and stressed that
"the health and safety of our employees is our top priority."</TE>
<TE>   Workers in the county building are receiving letters explaining
the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Legionnaires' disease affects 8,000 to 18,000 people per year and
is fatal in 5% to 30% of cases.</TE>

<HD>Bush May Pay Back Gore-Loyal California by Tightening the
Tap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember those annoying days of water rationing 10 years ago? We
might see a return in the near future, thanks to drought, water feuds
and the fact that President Bush has no love for California.</LD>
<LD>   The penalty for an Al Gore vote in 2000 could be that your front
lawn dies in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   "It could be worse than it was in the early 1990s," says Gerry
Zimmerman of the Colorado River Board of California. The board hosts
a meeting today featuring a Bush administration official who is
expected to wag a finger at our gluttonous thirst and threaten to cut
our Colorado River supply by the end of the year.</LD>
<TE>   Ordinarily, my rule is to steer clear of water policy, because I
get a blinding headache three paragraphs into any such story and then
swallow my tongue. But this one has a lot going for it.</TE>
<TE>   It got off to a good start when an Imperial Valley water official
named Bruce Kuhn called U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein "a bureaucratic
gasbag, pig-eyed sack of crap." Feinstein had suggested that farmers
let some of their land go dry so water can be piped to city folk in
San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Then we had a TV news report that it's already so dry, desperate
rats are invading homes and restaurants in Santa Monica. That city
being what it is, I'm sure we can expect a study on the environmental
side-effects of cloud-seeding, if not living-wage legislation for
rodents.</TE>
<TE>   And now we have Bennett Raley of the Department of the Interior
visiting L.A. to beat us with a stick. Raley once worked for the same
anti-environment law firm as James Watt, lobbied against
reauthorization of the 1994 Clean Water Act and represented a
business group in opposing the Endangered Species Act. So of course
he was an obvious pick for Bush as assistant Interior secretary for
water and science.</TE>
<TE>   California has had a water deal in place for years, allowing it to
draw beyond its allocation from the Colorado River, which feeds water
to eight states. But now some of the other states want more for
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Raley has offered to extend our sweetheart deal if we work out an
agreement to transfer water from the sparsely populated Imperial and
Coachella valleys to parched cities and suburbs in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   But if we don't--and it's a big if, given the rancor illustrated
by the "pig-eyed sack of crap" battle cry--our extra allocation will
be cut off on Dec. 31. The other trick we've got to pull off is to
divert that water without killing off the already endangered Salton
Sea.</TE>
<TE>   A reasonable person might say, "Well, fair is fair." For decades,
we've stolen water like champs--L.A. was in fact built by world-class
thieves--and we're no longer the only overdeveloped state that wants
to siphon off more than its share. But here's the question of the
day:</TE>
<TE>   If we'd voted for Bush, would he be taking a strap to us like
this?</TE>
<TE>   Of course not. California is the president's redheaded stepchild.</TE>
<TE>   When we had what looked like an energy crisis last year and turned
to him for help, Bush told us it was our problem. (Actually it turned
out to be more his problem, wouldn't you say? It was the beginning of
the nosedive by his pals and advisors from Enron, not to mention the
rest of corporate America.)</TE>
<TE>   When he bought out the offshore drilling leases in his brother
Jeb's state of Florida, and we asked for the same deal in California,
Bush told us to drop dead.</TE>
<TE>   Our only hope for a fair shake from the White House is for
Republican Bill Simon to take out Gov. Gray Davis, the human ATM. But
given the IRS investigation into a possible tax shelter by Simon's
family's business, and the candidate's little magic act with his tax
records--now you see them, now you don't--he can't be trusted to show
up at a fund-raising barbecue without setting himself ablaze.</TE>
<TE>   California, despite being punished for the sins of its electorate,
sets the national standard for recycling water. Adan Ortega of the
Metropolitan Water District says we've cut our consumption from 205
gallons a person per day in 1980 to 170 today. We've done so well, he
thinks we could weather a year of reduced supply before serious
rationing kicks in.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, tells me
California could do a better job with agricultural water
conservation. But we're no slouch in conserving both energy and
water.</TE>
<TE>   And now here's the Bush administration telling us to dry up while
it backs outrageously water-reckless energy policy in Wyoming,
Montana and Colorado, all of which voted for guess who.</TE>
<TE>   Despite howls from environmentalists and a nose-holding
condemnation from his very own Environmental Protection Agency, a key
part of Bush's energy policy is coal-bed drilling for methane. The
process drains aquifers, flushing millions of gallons of salty water
to the surface, fouling waterways, ruining crops and driving ranchers
nuts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about as profligate a practice as you can think of, because
this leaves the water to evaporate on the surface in one of the
driest parts of the West," says Maggie Fox, deputy executive director
of the Sierra Club. "It's past wasteful. It's on to ridiculous,
actually."</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado River Board of California meeting is from 10 a.m. to
2 p.m. today at the Metropolitan Water District, 700 N. Alameda St.
Feel free to go and tell Bennett Raley what you think. But keep in
mind that "bureaucratic gasbag, pig-eyed sack of crap" has already
been used.</TE>

<HD>School Chief to Be Charged With Molesting Girl</HD>
<DH>Crime: The former head of a Westlake Village junior high,
who was fired after his arrest, is accused of acts involving a
student.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The director of Oaks Christian Middle School in Westlake Village will
be arraigned Thursday in Ventura County Superior Court on 15 felony
counts of molesting a 13-year-old female student whose family he had
befriended.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Andreas, 36, was arrested at a Thousand Oaks residence
Saturday. The girl's parents reported the alleged incidents to the
Ventura County Sheriff's Department last week, said Cmdr. Keith Parks
of the Thousand Oaks sheriff's station.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County investigators said that Andreas, who was being held
Tuesday in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $500,000 bail, allegedly
molested the girl several times this year at multiple locations in
Thousand Oaks. Parks declined to provide further details, citing the
ongoing investigation, but said there were no other known victims.</LD>
<TE>   "He had become a friend of the young girl and her family through
connections at school and took advantage of the relationship," Parks
said Tuesday after the arrest was announced.</TE>
<TE>   School officials fired Andreas on Tuesday, said Tom Konjoyan,
director of development for the sprawling campus, which includes the
middle school and a high school. The officials learned about the
arrest Sunday from the Sheriff's Department, he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 180 students attend the middle school, which Andreas of
Thousand Oaks had managed since Oaks Christian opened two years ago.
Konjoyan declined to provide Andreas' employment history but said he
had taught at several private schools in Southern California before
Oaks Christian.</TE>
<TE>   School officials released a statement Tuesday expressing sympathy
for the Thousand Oaks girl and her family.</TE>
<TE>   Konjoyan said school officials knew nothing about the allegations
before Sunday and are cooperating with the Sheriff's Department,
while contacting parents of students who will attend grades six to
eight in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "In the days ahead, we intend to communicate with those who love
this school and to listen to their concerns," Headmaster Jeff
Woodcock said in the statement. "Our intention is to be as open and
forthcoming as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Andreas appeared in court briefly Tuesday for his arraignment,
which was postponed because his lawyer could not attend. He wore a
light blue jail uniform and exchanged a few words with his stand-in
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Should Andreas post bail and be released from jail, he was ordered
by Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kevin J. McGee to refrain from
contact with the girl or her family, to surrender his passport and to
stay away from computers.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas is considered a flight risk because he had substantial
contacts with people in other countries through tutoring he had done,
said Lisa Lyytikainen of the Ventura County district attorney's
office. He was barred from using computers and having access to the
Internet because the investigation showed that he had considerable
contact with the girl via e-mail, Lyytikainen said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 15 charges of lewd and lascivious contact with
a child under the age of 14 that will be filed against him Thursday,
Andreas will face special allegations of substantial sexual conduct
with a minor, which could lead to a harsher sentence if he is
convicted, Lyytikainen said.</TE>

<HD>Westlake Village Educator Accused of Molesting Girl</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The director of Oaks Christian Middle School in Westlake Village will
be arraigned Thursday in Ventura County Superior Court on 15 felony
counts of molesting a 13-year-old female student whose family he had
befriended.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Andreas, 36, was arrested at a Thousand Oaks residence
Saturday. The girl's parents reported the alleged incidents to the
Ventura County Sheriff's Department last week, said Cmdr. Keith Parks
of the Thousand Oaks sheriff's station.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County investigators said that Andreas, who was being held
Tuesday in Ventura County Jail on $500,000 bail, allegedly molested
the girl several times this year in Thousand Oaks. Parks declined to
provide further details, citing the ongoing investigation, but said
there were no other known victims.</LD>
<TE>   "He had become a friend of the young girl and her family through
connections at school and took advantage of the relationship," Parks
said Tuesday after the arrest was announced.</TE>
<TE>   School officials fired Andreas on Tuesday, said Tom Konjoyan,
director of development for the sprawling campus, which includes the
middle school and a high school. The officials learned about the
arrest Sunday from the Sheriff's Department, he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 180 students attend the middle school, which Andreas of
Thousand Oaks had managed since Oaks Christian opened two years ago
just north of the Ventura Freeway. Konjoyan declined to provide
Andreas' employment history but said he had taught at several private
schools in Southern California before being hired at Oaks Christian.</TE>
<TE>   School officials released a statement Tuesday expressing sympathy
for the Thousand Oaks girl and her family.</TE>
<TE>   Konjoyan said school officials knew nothing about the allegations
before Sunday and are cooperating with the Sheriff's Department,
while contacting parents of students who will attend grades six to
eight in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "In the days ahead, we intend to communicate with those who love
this school and to listen to their concerns," Headmaster Jeff
Woodcock said in the statement. "Our intention is to be as open and
forthcoming as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Andreas appeared in court briefly Tuesday for his arraignment,
which was postponed because his lawyer could not attend. He wore a
light blue jail uniform and exchanged a few words with his stand-in
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Should Andreas post bail and be released from jail, he was ordered
by Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kevin J. McGee to refrain from
contact with the girl or her family, to surrender his passport and to
stay away from computers.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas is considered a flight risk because he had substantial
contacts with people in other countries through tutoring he had done,
said Lisa Lyytikainen of the Ventura County district attorney's
office. He was barred from using computers and having access to the
Internet because the investigation showed that he had considerable
contact with the girl via e-mail, Lyytikainen said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 15 charges of lewd and lascivious contact with
a child under the age of 14 that will be filed against him Thursday,
Andreas will face special allegations of substantial sexual conduct
with a minor, which could lead to a harsher sentence if he is
convicted, Lyytikainen said.</TE>
<TE>   In another recent child molestation case in Ventura County,
Camarillo High School science teacher Chad Pridgen, who has been
charged with 36 felony and misdemeanor counts of child molestation,
is scheduled to appear in court Aug. 15, when prosecutors are
expected to set a preliminary hearing date.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen, 30, is accused of molesting 11 teenage boys, all but two
of whom are former or current Camarillo High students. Sheriff's
investigators say that Pridgen used his authority as a teacher to
coerce students into performing sex acts for him.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The city dedicated a new seaside park Tuesday that will offer the
public a rare view of the ocean from Pacific Coast Highway.</LD>
<LD>   Browns' Park, on a 25-foot-by-100-foot strip of land connecting
the highway to the sea in the 500 block of South Coast Highway, has a
winding pathway leading to a wooden platform overlooking the ocean.
"We are pleased to have worked with the city to make this park a
reality," said Paul Morabito, chairman of the California Coastal
Conservancy.</LD>
<LD>   The land--worth well over $1 million--was donated to the city in
1999 by Joseph E. Brown of Rochester, N.Y., whose family had owned it
since the 1930s. A small two-story home at the site was demolished by
the city after sustaining major damage during the El Nino storms of
1997.</LD>
<TE>   "My family enjoyed it for nearly 60 years," Brown told The Times
in March. "Now many families can enjoy it."</TE>

<HD>What's in a Name? 'Sexiest Man Alive' Found 'Henry' Less
Than Appealing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Little did Henry W. Beaty suspect, as he was growing up, that he
would some day be the subject of a book titled "The Sexiest Man
Alive." I'm talking, of course, about Warren Beatty.</LD>
<LD>   Biographer Ellis Amburn says that the actor never liked his real
first name because at home he was called Little Henry owing to "his
unfortunate resemblance to the imbecilic-looking cartoon character of
that name." (Beatty later added a "t" to his last name.)</LD>
<LD>   It's difficult to see any similarities between the two Henrys now
(see accompanying), though I guess you could say that the cartoon
character never had a bad hair day, either.</LD>
<TE>   Typecasting? Beatty, a political activist, has reportedly
considered running for office. If so, I doubt he'll use the speech he
made on one episode of TV's "Dobie Gillis."</TE>
<TE>   Beatty, portraying rich kid Milton Armitage, seeks the junior
class presidency and lectures his high school love, Thalia Menninger:
"How can I lose the election? I'm handsome, cultured, debonair,
attractive, manly. I'm in politics seriously. I owe it to my
class--the ruling class. I won't mince words. This junior class
presidency is merely the beginning. A finger exercise, so to speak.
I'm going onward and upward."</TE>
<TE>   Menninger tells him he won't win because "you're perfect. And
people don't vote for perfect people." He loses.</TE>
<TE>   Zip it: Amid the pizza parlors, bars and T-shirt shops of Virginia
Beach, Va., Jon Goetz of Irvine noticed signs warning against voice
pollution (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Kids, listen up! You graduate from college and maybe some
screenwriter will mention you, too, in a movie soon afterward. Film
historian Rick Mitchell notes that in the new horror film,
"Halloween: Resurrection," a character says, "I went to Long Beach
University, just like Spielberg." I guess the character didn't go
there long enough to know it's Cal State Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   That personal touch: The Los Alamitos News-Enterprise's police log
carried a report about a man in a shop who "tried to sell a customer
some diamonds from a bagful he was carrying." What's suspicious about
that?</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: As Malibu Times' columnist Kim Devore put it, Eric
Idle's speech "was pure Monty Python" when he accepted an award for
his late pal George Harrison from the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame.
"When I heard they were giving George the award," Idle said, "my
first thought was, 'I bet he won't show up.' "</TE>

<HD>State Repeals Oracle Contract</HD>
<DH>Technology: Software maker and partner Logicon agree to
repay $52million and let California off the hook with no money lost
on embarrassing deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California repealed a much-disputed $95-million computer software
contract with Oracle Corp. on Tuesday and will lose no money under
the deal, according to Gov. Gray Davis and officials with the state
attorney general's office.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement with Oracle and Logicon Corp. puts an end to a broad
six-year contract that was supposed to save money but instead became
a political embarrassment for Davis, and another chapter in the
state's long history of bungled information technology purchases.</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms of the deal to unwind the contract, Oracle and
Logicon, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, will pay back the $52.3
million the state borrowed last summer to make an upfront payment on
the contract. The state is also relieved of any future payments.</LD>
<TE>   "Oracle and Grumman are paying the $52-million principle, $3
million in interest, and there's a breakup fee of about $1.2
million," said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.
"The state is not paying anything.</TE>
<TE>   "We have confirmation that money has been wired, and the deal is
closed," said Goode. "It's done."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers who spent more than 100 hours in hearings this spring
examining the Oracle contract expressed relief.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter) called the agreement "a good
deal."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ecstatic that we got our money back," said Florez, who headed
the committee that examined why the Oracle contract was rushed
through the state bureaucracy in less than a month. "We wouldn't be
rescinding this contract without hearings and enormous amounts of
media attention."</TE>
<TE>   Florez called the original May 2001 Oracle contract a deal "so
smelly and rotten" that Oracle and Logicon didn't want to fight to
keep a penny of it.</TE>
<TE>   The hearings showed that Oracle employees intentionally withheld
information from the state during contract negotiations. Testimony
revealed a bureaucracy in which department supervisors overlooked
warnings from career civil servants.</TE>
<TE>   An Oracle lobbyist gave a $25,000 campaign contribution to Davis'
director of technology services just days after the Oracle contract
was signed, but the hearings uncovered no direct evidence that
political donations influenced the crafting of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle Vice President Jim Finn issued a terse statement Tuesday,
saying that the software company, based in Redwood Shores, "is
pleased to have resolved this matter to the satisfaction of the
state."</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman Information Technology Vice President Steve
Carrier said that although the company believes that the original
contract "would have provided good value to the citizens of
California, our principal concern remains customer satisfaction."</TE>
<TE>   In the agreement, the companies waive all claims against the
state, and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer agrees to release the
companies from future prosecution for making false claims. But
California retains the right to prosecute the companies for
violations of the Political Reform Act, willful fraud or criminal
activity.</TE>
<TE>   A criminal investigation of the Oracle contract is still underway,
said Christopher Ames, senior assistant attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   The original contract was designed to save the state money as it
bought a variety of Oracle software and database products for various
agencies. The state had never before signed such a sweeping deal,
called an "enterprise license agreement," with a software company.</TE>
<TE>   In a scathing report in April, the state auditor concluded that
rather than save the state up to $111 million, as Logicon had claimed
it would do, the contract could cost the state $6 million to $41
million more than it would have otherwise spent.</TE>
<TE>   The auditor found that the Department of Information Technology,
the Department of General Services and the Department of Finance
failed to quantify how much Oracle software the state might need to
buy over the next decade and failed to validate Logicon's claims.</TE>
<TE>   Fallout from the contract included the firing of three department
directors and a member of Davis' staff, the dissolution of the
Department of Information Technology and an overhaul of state
guidelines for buying computer goods and services.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened the first time will never happen again," said
Clothilde Hewlett, the interim director of the Department of General
Services.</TE>

<HD>Summer in the Cities: Brea, Fullerton Start Feudin' Over
Their Downtowns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Which has the better downtown, Brea or Fullerton?</LD>
<LD>   No, it isn't a trick question (Brea does have a downtown), but the
issue before the house is whether it's better than Fullerton's. While
such a question might well have lain dormant for decades without
needing to be answered, it has been raised in the neighboring cities
and, for the lack of anything better in Orange County, could spark a
feud that'll enliven the summer.</LD>
<LD>   Fullerton apparently started things by advertising in a Brea
theater, touting itself as having "a real downtown." That's just the
kind of remark that'll get a city's goat, and it did. Brea fired back
with a letter to Fullerton city officials, suggesting they were
trying to pirate business from Brea.</LD>
<TE>   That charge may require a grand jury investigation, but the other
question lingers: which downtown is better--Brea's modish offering or
Fullerton's somewhat more lived-in look?</TE>
<TE>   I patrolled both of them Tuesday morning, carefully jotting down
observations as I walked under a boiling sun. The first problem was
determining exactly where downtown Brea begins. Banners have sprouted
all along Brea Boulevard between Lambert Road and Imperial Highway,
but much of the uninspiring stretch could pass for the outskirts of
Topeka, Kan. I hope the city isn't touting the whole stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, though, I found what must be the heart of
downtown--the famous Birch Street corridor.</TE>
<TE>   It's a short corridor, and I'd been there before and had the same
weird feeling--that I was on the back lot of a Hollywood set. The
street seemed created from a set of instructions. It could have been
featured in the movie "Pleasantville."</TE>
<TE>   An old-style clock on the sidewalk even bears the inscription
"Good Old Brea."</TE>
<TE>   You could stand there on Birch Street for a long time and try to
think of a word to describe the personality of the downtown. Believe
me, I tried.</TE>
<TE>   I met a drywall finisher named Jonathan Swift (that's what he told
me). He says he has done lots of work in South County, where they're
also trying to invent "downtowns" where none existed.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to know a lot about old-time American downtowns, and
finds Brea architecture lacking. "See, it's very square, very cut
out. There's not a lot of feeling. In the old buildings, the crown
moldings, the edgings, the windows, they were built to detail."</TE>
<TE>   If Brea is too artificial for you, you'll love Fullerton. Nobody
could call its downtown contrived. In one stretch of six storefronts,
I counted four that are either closed or going out of business.
Perhaps "in transition" would be a nice way to describe what's going
on there. While downtown Brea has two theaters within a block of each
other, downtown Fullerton has one--the Fox, which has been closed for
15 years.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Fullerton scores big with the Chapman Building,
which opened in 1923 and is still going. The downtown, which
definitely has a flavor and personality that Brea's doesn't, still is
a bit too heavy on the antiques/collectibles industry to suit my
taste. Or, for that matter, to qualify as a downtown by any standard

<TE>   Sadly, isn't that the issue? Who cares if Fullerton's aging
quaintness compares favorably with Brea's manufactured hipness? We're
not exactly talking Vienna and Paris--or even Minneapolis and St.
Paul.</TE>
<TE>   "Brea's downtown is more like a moneymaker," Fullerton bank
employee Chad Dewey says. "Here, there's more history."</TE>
<TE>   Are downtowns even relevant in today's hip world, where The Block

something for the tourists to come and see."</TE>

<HD>Judge Halts Work on New Port of L.A. Terminal</HD>
<DH>Courts: Coalition of environmentalists, residents wins a
round against project they say ignores public safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Tuesday halted construction of a 174-acre terminal
at the Port of Los Angeles that community and environmental groups
charge is being built without regard for public safety.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Margaret Morrow's temporary restraining order
came as work crews were pouring 100 feet of new concrete in a rush to
complete the China Shipping Holding Co. terminal.</LD>
<LD>   The delay was needed, Morrow said, to give her time to study a
request by a coalition of community and environmental groups for an
even lengthier preliminary injunction against the project.</LD>
<TE>   The coalition wants work stopped while a study is conducted on the
possible environmental impact of the terminal being built within 500
feet of homes in San Pedro, just north of the Vincent Thomas Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Morrow expects to rule on the request for a preliminary injunction
by Friday.</TE>
<TE>   When in full swing, the terminal will operate two new four-lane
bridges, 10 cranes--four of them 16 stories tall--and two wharves
designed to handle 260 of the world's largest ships and 1.5 million
20-foot cargo containers each year.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition attorney Gail Ruderman Feuer of the Natural Resources
Defense Council said the delay marked the first victory of its kind
for harbor-area residents who have felt overwhelmed for years by
massive port expansion projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The ruling today is welcome news to the local community, which
has been battling this particular project for over a year," Feuer
said. "This terminal is enormous, and you can't ignore the
environmental consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Among the 50 San Pedro and Wilmington residents who attended
Tuesday's court hearing was Jesse Marquez, chairman of the Wilmington
Coalition for a Safe Environment.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of thing has never happened before," he said. "It's a
public blessing that is long overdue--that is, in terms of public
safety concerns versus what's good for corporate business."</TE>
<TE>   John Miller, an emergency physician and resident of San Pedro,
agreed, but added: "We don't want to shut down the port. We want it
up and moving. It's just got to move in a way that doesn't poison the
air."</TE>
<TE>   However, Peter Hsiao, an attorney representing the Port of Los
Angeles, expressed concerns about the delay's impact on his client's
finances, and the physical stability of the China Shipping facility,
which is about 60% completed.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to be able to finish the work we started today at
6:30 a.m.," Hsiao told Morrow. "Stopping mid-pour will cause
significant damage to the port."</TE>
<TE>   Morrow agreed to allow the concrete work to continue. But she
ordered that all other work at the site be stopped "effective now."</TE>
<TE>   In the long-term, the port would incur costs of about $1.2 million
a month if it cannot take delivery of the four 16-story-tall cranes
on time, according to documents filed with the court by defense
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor residents have been fighting the project since China
Shipping won a $650-million lease agreement from the Los Angeles City
Council a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor-area organizations, including those that had endorsed
secession from the city of Los Angeles, were angered by the City
Council's unanimous approval of the project.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition responded by filing a lawsuit in Los Angeles
Superior Court against Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Harbor Department
and China Shipping.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks assurances that environmental reviews are properly
completed and that the impact of development is mitigated.</TE>
<TE>   The state court ruled against the coalition, which includes the
National Resources Defense Council, San Pedro and Peninsula
Homeowners Coalition, San Pedro Peninsula Homeowners United Inc. and
the Coalition for Clean Air.</TE>
<TE>   The group is appealing the state court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern to coalition members is a projected increase
in diesel emissions--a known carcinogen--from the additional cargo
ships, tugboats and truck traffic the new terminal will generate in
local communities.</TE>
<TE>   "The port communities of Wilmington and San Pedro are believed to
suffer a cancer risk of up to 1,531 times what the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency considers to be an acceptable risk," said Todd
Campbell, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granted China
Shipping permission to build Phase 1-- a 1,200-foot-long wharf--after
determining that it would actually improve regional air quality by
enhancing efficiency in cargo handling in an existing industrial
zone.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition challenged that permit in federal court on grounds
that the corps should have assessed the "cumulative" impact of the
entire three-phase project before allowing construction of the wharf
to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, port contractors have been working almost nonstop at
the terminal site.</TE>
<TE>   "They said it would take five months to complete the wharf
project," Feuer said in court. "In one month, they're halfway there."</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to expand a ban on smoking
in city parks.</LD>
<LD>   Broadening a state law that prohibits smoking near children's play
areas and sandboxes, the city ordinance would ban smoking within 25
feet of playgrounds, bleachers, backstops, sports fields, ball
diamonds and courts used for basketball, handball, tennis and paddle
tennis. It also outlaws smoking in picnic areas where permits are
required.</LD>
<LD>   If Mayor James K. Hahn approves the smoking ban, it would become
law 30 days after his signature.</LD>

<HD>Simon's Disclosure Raises New Doubts</HD>
<DH>Politics: After limited unveiling of his taxes, some
question his business success, ability to finance campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK, MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Far from laying aside the issue of his tax history, Bill Simon Jr.
faced a fresh round of questions Tuesday as Democrats challenged his
candor and attacked his business record.</LD>
<LD>   The GOP gubernatorial nominee scrubbed a radio interview and made
no public appearances, leaving aides to insist the tax question was
closed. "We feel this issue is behind us now," said Mark Miner, a
spokesman for Simon.</LD>
<LD>   But strategists for Democratic Gov. Gray Davis stepped up their
assault, plotting a new round of TV ads starting as early as today.
"He didn't get the monkey off his back," said Garry South, chief
advisor to Davis' reelection effort.</LD>
<TE>   After months of resistance, Simon released 11 years' worth of tax
returns Monday, but gave reporters only a few hours to review them.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, there were new questions, including doubts about the
candidate's ability to finance the costly campaign and whether his
track record matches the business acumen he touts as his chief
credential for seeking California's highest office.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, for instance, Simon reported $8.8 million in investment
losses in the midst of the stock market boom. It was unclear, given
the limited chance for review, whether the losses reflected poor
investment decisions on Simon's part, or a calculated move to offset
more than $10 million in gains, thus reducing his tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   It was also unclear whether the losses related to a tax shelter
created by the KPMG accounting firm for Simon and other clients and
now under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS has
gone to court to obtain a confidential opinion concerning tax advice
that Simon received from KPMG partner Neil J. Tendler--the same
accountant who prepared Simon's 2000 tax return.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there was no accounting of his 1995 California tax
return or those Simon filed in other states that year, which his
campaign said were missing.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving those details aside, many of Simon's fellow Republicans
were satisfied that Simon had done enough to sate the public's
curiosity and put an end to the political controversy, mainly by
showing he paid a sizable chunk of his income in state and local
taxes in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "They released the tax returns," said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist
and specialist in campaign communications. "The conditions under
which they were released is not nearly enough to interest the average
voter."</TE>
<TE>   Other Republicans disagreed, however, suggesting the view within
party circles had merely shifted from a discussion of whether Simon
should or shouldn't release his tax returns--with most campaign
insiders saying yes--to a debate over whether Simon had or hadn't
revealed enough.</TE>
<TE>   "For those of us who support Simon, those of us who want to see
him put together a smart campaign, this is something he should have
done a long time ago," said GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum. "But
what he did was whet the appetite, not quench the thirst."</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to do it, give them everything they want,"
Hoffenblum went on. "When you have hungry dogs out there, don't give
them a piece of baloney. You've got to give them the whole steak, or
they're not going to be satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   The documents furnished Monday show that Simon earned roughly $36
million from 1990 to 2000 and paid about one-third of it in state and
federal taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But reporters were allowed little more than a cursory glimpse at
the voluminous amount of material released. They were given just a
few hours--on short notice--to review well over 1,000 pages of dense
documents, were forbidden from making copies and were expected to use
blank sheets of paper provided by the Simon campaign for taking
notes.</TE>
<TE>   Given the time limits, it was virtually impossible in most cases
to evaluate which investments were winners and which were losers. And
reporters were forbidden from turning to outside experts, such as
accountants or tax lawyers, for help in deciphering the documents.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they turned to the campaign's political strategists who
confessed to their own lack of expertise. Simon's chief campaign
strategist, Sal Russo, hovered in the viewing room where reporters
gathered Monday but turned aside numerous requests for more
information, saying he did not know the answer.</TE>
<TE>   Russo, for instance, could not name any of the investments that
led Simon to file income tax returns in Oklahoma, Georgia,
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and other states.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the ultimate IRS finding on the use of tax shelters, it
is clear that Simon reaped substantial tax savings from 1998 to 2000
by reporting a sharp rise in investment losses.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, however, little more could be gleaned, besides the
fact that Simon is in fact quite well-to-do and has given millions of
dollars to charity over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "Even people in the Big Four or Big Five accounting firms--with
that limited amount of time, they're not going to be able to give you
any opinions," said Robert Mah, managing partner of a San Francisco
accounting firm. "You have to look at the details."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Simon strategists sought to focus Tuesday on the
proverbial bottom line--the more than $11 million in taxes that Simon
paid--while at the same time minimizing its importance to most
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this tax issue was ever a real concern for the
majority of Californians," said Miner, who suggested Davis had kept
the issue alive as "a shield to hide behind. Now the shield's gone."</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign, however, showed no intention of backing away
from the tax issue, which has plagued Simon since the spring.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not full disclosure--this was a drive-by document drop,"
South said. "What about the tax shelters? What about all the millions
of dollars he's claimed in losses at a time when the economy was
booming? The way I read it, the guy is either a terrible businessman
... or he's engaging in tax shelters to reduce his tax obligations."</TE>
<TE>   The materials provided Monday also raised some concern in GOP
circles about the financial strength of Simon's candidacy. While he
is clearly well off, some Republicans believed he was wealthier than
his earnings in the last 10 years would suggest--or at least rich
enough to spare the tens of millions of dollars he might need to keep
up with the heavily funded Davis.</TE>
<TE>   On the day Simon announced his candidacy in November, the campaign
boasted of a $60-million budget. But by its own reckoning, the
campaign has raised only about $10 million since Simon won the March
GOP primary, and so far the candidate has resisted putting any
personal cash into the November contest. In contrast, Davis has
raised more than $50 million toward his reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis has always said he had to raise all this money to compete
with a millionaire opponent," said Kevin Spillane, a GOP strategist
in Sacramento. "Well now he's facing one, but even that guy isn't
wealthy enough to match all the special interest money that Davis has
raised."</TE>
<TE>   Simon had said he would be one of the largest donors to his
campaign. But Tuesday, spokesman Miner declined to reaffirm that
commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been no discussion about whether Bill Simon is going to
put any money in this campaign," Miner said. "We're raising money,
and that will increase into summer months and the fall, and we'll
have the resources necessary to run a strong campaign."</TE>
<TE>   By opening himself to Monday's selective scrutiny, Simon became
just the latest in a long line of well-to-do candidates who fought
calls for financial disclosure, but ultimately bowed to political
pressure. There are no laws requiring a candidate to reveal private
tax returns, but disclosure has become the norm in most high-profile
races.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Democrat Dianne Feinstein was forced to detail her
personal finances and those of her husband, investor Dick Blum, when
she ran for governor in 1990. In New York, Republican George Pataki
capitulated and released his tax returns in 1994 after a monthlong
pounding from his opponents. (One of Pataki's advisors was Russo.)</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the affluence of New Jersey businessman Jon Corzine
became a major issue in his 2000 U.S. Senate bid. Corzine, the former
chairman of Goldman Sachs, spent more than $60 million to win his
U.S. Senate seat. He refused to make his income tax returns
public--citing a confidentiality agreement with Goldman Sachs--but
eventually released four years' worth of records detailing his
income, tax history and charitable contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Given today's political climate--with the stock market in crisis,
corporate corruption in the headlines and the public's faith in
business plunging--it was increasingly untenable for Simon to keep
resisting the release of his tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   "Every poll has shown voters are very skeptical of corporate
America right now," said Sherry Bebich Jeffe, a political science
expert at USC. "Throughout the whole campaign, Simon's mantra has
been, 'Trust me, I'm a businessman.' So really, he had no choice."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Jeffrey Rabin contributed to this report.</TE>

<TE>Taxing Questions</TE>
<TE>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon gave reporters a brief
opportunity to examine his federal and state income tax returns.
Simon's income was offset by significant losses from investments,
particularly from 1998 to 2000. Simon did not reveal his 1995 state
tax returns. He has yet to file tax returns for last year.</TE>

<HD>America's Cup Yacht Sinks Off Long Beach</HD>
<DH>Sailing: Skipper Dennis Conner is dealt setback as rudder
shaft snaps on new sloop. Crew is safe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN and LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sailing legend Dennis Conner's newest America's Cup racing vessel
sank abruptly off Long Beach on Tuesday when the rudder shaft snapped
during a training exercise.</LD>
<LD>   The damage to the $5-million, 80-foot sloop dealt a setback to
Conner, who will make a ninth appearance in the trials to challenge
for the 2003 America's Cup in Auckland, New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   The Stars &amp; Stripes USA-77 was sailing alongside Conner's sister
Stars &amp; Stripes USA-66 in a routine two-boat testing session about 1
p.m. when "a large crack was heard and the rudder detached from the
hull," Conner's team spokeswoman said.</LD>
<TE>   Crew members worked furiously to block the water, deploying air
bags and preparing on-board pumps, but they were outmatched.</TE>
<TE>   "The water came in so fast that the pumps and the air bags could
not keep up," said Bill Trenkle, Conner's general manager and
longtime sail trimmer, who was aboard the vessel.</TE>
<TE>   Within five minutes, the yacht sank in about 55 feet of water 1.3
miles south of Alamitos Bay, lodging in soft mud with its black mast
protruding from the water at a tilt.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 16 crew members aboard were able to step onto chase
boats that had been tracking the team, and the few who jumped into
the water were quickly pulled on board, Trenkle said. No one was
injured.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is no one was hurt," Conner said. "The crew hardly
got wet."</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Stephen LaLonde said officials received
the distress call from one of Conner's support vessels about 1:30
p.m. and contacted Long Beach Fire Department lifeguards, whose
rescue boat is moored nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time they got to the scene, the Stars &amp; Stripes had
already sunk," LaLonde said.</TE>
<TE>   The 32-member racing team has been training at the Team Dennis
Conner compound in Long Beach since February, but only began sailing
the boat in late May. Training involved daily two-boat testing
sessions as well as match-racing practice.</TE>
<TE>   Conner, who spends most of his time fund-raising for his
$40-million America's Cup budget, was at a nearby sponsor event, but
rushed to the salvage scene.</TE>
<TE>   Conner said he is confident the high-tech boat can be repaired in
time for the start of the Cup competition, which begins Oct. 1 with
the Luis Vuitton challenger trials. He said the broken rudder shaft
tore a hole in the carbon-fiber hull.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to talk about luck, we're normally sailing where it's
2,000 feet deep," Conner said from his Terminal Island complex.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday was to be the team's last sailing day, and the boats were
slated to be shipped to New Zealand by container on July 30 and Aug.
6. Conner said in a statement that he expects those dates to stand.</TE>
<TE>   Conner has won the 151-year-old America's Cup four times, but not
since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The sloop that sank made its debut May 11 at the New York Yacht
Club's opening day at its summer clubhouse in Newport, R.I.</TE>
<TE>   The club is backing Conner for the first time since he lost the
cup to Alan Bond's Australia II in 1983 at Newport. The boat was
christened May 26 in Long Beach. Its companion, USA-66, was launched
in February.</TE>
<TE>   America's Cup contenders can only race one yacht at a time. This
is the first time since the 1986-87 competition that Conner has been
able to afford two new boats, but all has not gone smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   In early March, one of the carbon-fiber masts on USA-66 broke in a
moderate breeze, but was replaced by a new mast, Conner announced at
the time on his team's Web site, saying his technical experts had
"learned a great deal from this incident."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's incident was another blow.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course this is a setback," said New York Yacht Club spokesman
Michael Leavitt, adding that it was unclear how long repairs might
take.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be days, it could be months," he said. "Fortunately,
there is some time available. This is an edgy game, and there are
going to be setbacks like this."</TE>
<TE>   By about 6 p.m., a private salvage crane floated to the submerged
vessel on a barge. Assisted by divers, the barge began the slow
process of hauling the groaning yacht to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   As the hull emerged, a crack about 4 inches wide and 18 inches
long could be seen in the middle of the hull, directly below the
110-foot mast.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen pleasure boats milled at the scene as boaters
watched the rescue.</TE>
<TE>   The yacht was built at the New England Boatworks in Portsmouth,
R.I. Before the finishing touches were placed on the vessel, Conner
said in April that he "had a good feeling" about both new boats.</TE>
<TE>   "But I know better than anyone that the competition is tougher
than ever, and we're going to have to continue our intense training
schedule to be on an even playing field with the other teams," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the challengers' Luis Vuitton Cup will take on
two-time winner Team New Zealand in February for the America's Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The only other America's Cup yacht to sink was oneAustralia, which
cracked in two and sank in 950 feet of water about five miles off San
Diego during a challenger series race in March 1995. All 16 sailors
were rescued. The yacht was never recovered, but oneAustralia had a
backup boat.</TE>

<HD>Burning the Tobacco Windfall</HD>
<DH>Finance: Facing a budget crisis, the state is likely to
cash out its cigarette litigation settlement for immediate aid--at a
cost of $8 billion over time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to persuade
people to quit smoking. But now, scrambling to solve its budget
shortfall, the state has developed an unexpected habit: It's suddenly
hooked on tobacco money.</LD>
<LD>   Through proposals to raise the per-pack tax and to cash out the
state's share of the 1998 national tobacco litigation settlement,
cigarettes are an important part of the strategy to fill the state's
nearly $24-billion projected shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Davis administration and legislative leaders say the
proposals are not a retreat from California's decades-long effort to
curb tobacco use, the plans have nonetheless drawn criticism along
those lines from public health advocates. Budget analysts worry that
the fiscal approach is misguided as well.</LD>
<TE>   "It is certainly more than ironic," said Dick Daynard, a law
professor at Northeastern University in Boston and a tobacco
litigation expert, "that you're relying on money from smokers to
balance the budget."</TE>
<TE>   In the $99-billion spending plan stalled in the state Assembly,
Gov. Gray Davis and the Democratic-controlled Legislature would raise
taxes on cigarettes by $650 million a year, cut the state's
anti-tobacco program by $46 million and, most significantly, cash out
the massive tobacco litigation settlement for a one-time fix.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than take the $12.5-billion settlement in installments,
state leaders want to sell it to investors at a discount for a lump
sum of $4.5 billion--a one-time fix that would help plug this year's
shortfall but at the cost of $8 billion over time.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, money flowing directly and indirectly from tobacco
sales would erase more than one-fifth of this year's shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   California has aggressively fought tobacco use in recent years,
paying for graphic anti-smoking ads and limiting the places where
smoking is legal. Thanks in part to these efforts, California has the
second-lowest smoking rate of any state, at 17.4%, meaning there is
little political opposition to the budget proposal--at least the
portion that would raise cigarette taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But no money from either the tax increase or the one-time infusion
of tobacco settlement money would be spent specifically to combat
tobacco use.</TE>
<TE>   On that point, anti-smoking activists and Big Tobacco agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly," said Thomas M. Ryan, spokesman for Philip Morris
U.S.A., "the state has become more reliant on the sale of tobacco
products in order to balance the budget. I do believe it is ironic
that the state, while trying to balance the budget ... is taking
money away from tobacco control activities."</TE>
<TE>   Davis proposes to spend $88.3 million on California's tobacco
control program. That's $46 million less than last year, partly
because smoking has declined. The governor also is cutting by half
the most public face of the anti-tobacco program--the high-profile
anti-smoking advertising campaign that often derides tobacco
companies as it seeks to discourage tobacco use .</TE>
<TE>   "It is terrible," Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), the
Legislature's only physician, said of the spending cuts. "Money spent
on tobacco prevention is well spent."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials insist that Davis is not retreating from
his anti-tobacco stand. He had no choice but to cut some of the
spending given the state's financial straits, said Press Secretary
Steven Maviglio. And the rising tobacco tax will be a powerful
disincentive to smoke, particularly among teenagers, who are most
sensitive to price increases, he said.</TE>
<TE>   California would continue to have the richest anti-tobacco program
of any state because of a tax of 25 additional cents per pack imposed
on cigarettes in 1988 when voters approved Proposition 99. The
cigarette tax would rise 63 cents more per pack under the proposed
budget, to a total of $1.50.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is a question of funding more billboards and public
service announcements, or making sure kids get health care this year,
there is no argument," Maviglio said. With the budget for the 2002-03
fiscal year stalled in the Assembly, the state cannot sell the bonds
secured by the tobacco settlement. But once the bonds are marketed,
California will count on Wall Street to conclude that bonds secured
by tobacco settlement payments will be a solid long-term investment.</TE>
<TE>   The strength of that investment will depend in part on people
continuing to smoke. In a prospectus for one state, Wisconsin, that
is already selling tobacco bonds, investors are warned that a
"decline in cigarette consumption materially beyond forecasted levels
may adversely affect payments" to repay the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   California Department of Finance experts say the tobacco industry
would be able to make the bond payments even if companies responsible
for one-fourth of all tobacco sales were to go bankrupt. If tobacco
companies were unable to make their full annual payments, the life of
the bonds would be extended.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody would have to stop smoking" in order for investors to
lose their money, said the department's James E. Tilton.</TE>
<TE>   The $4.5-billion lump-sum payment would be the largest single
block of cash used to fill California's budget shortfall. The money
would go into the general fund, to be used for programs ranging from
parks and education to health care. After the money was spent this
year, the annual settlement payments would be used to repay the bonds
for at least 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   Some budget experts worry about the plan to use a one-time
windfall to pay for costs that continue year after year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the difference between taking out a mortgage to buy a house
[and] using a loan to buy groceries," said Jean Ross of the
California Budget Project, a nonprofit group that has suggested more
tax increases, particularly on high-income earners, as a solution.
"Most people would agree that if you have other options available,
you don't borrow to pay for ongoing operation costs."</TE>
<TE>   The decision marks a turnaround from 1998, when states negotiated
the $206-billion settlement with the tobacco giants. Many lawyers and
health-care advocates involved in the cases predicted that states
would use the money for great public good.</TE>
<TE>   Davis played a key part in California's litigation. Trial lawyers,
among his political allies, suggested in 1996 that then-Lt. Gov.
Davis join the plaintiffs' suit against tobacco companies. At the
time, Republican state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, who later became
Davis' 1998 campaign opponent, balked at joining other states in the
nationwide action.</TE>
<TE>   Davis added his name to the lawsuit in 1997, saying he was acting
on behalf of all Californians. At a news conference announcing his
action, he said: "The lawsuit I'm announcing today will force
[tobacco companies] hopefully to pay for the medical costs necessary
to treat tobacco-related injuries."</TE>
<TE>   American Lung Assn. lobbyist Paul Knepprath recalled that media
event: "We stood alongside Mr. Davis when he filed his suit. We fully
expected that if there was a settlement, any dollars would be
directed toward tobacco control."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), among the lawyers who helped
sue the industry before he won his Senate seat in 1998, pushed to set
up a special tobacco settlement fund for health care within the
budget. He succeeded last year when the $474-million settlement
payment was spent on health-care programs for low-income families and
indigents, with $20 million earmarked for youth smoking prevention.
That $20-million appropriation is being eliminated this year.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn, like other Senate Democrats, voted for the spending plan
that includes the proposal to cash out the tobacco settlement fund.
The size of the shortfall left legislators with little choice, he
said. He called the decision extremely disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   While the state is cashing out its settlement, said Susan Kennedy,
Cabinet secretary to Davis, revenue from the tax increase on
cigarettes will be used "dollar for dollar" to pay for health-care
programs previously funded by the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' plan would push California's cigarette tax to among the
highest in the nation. The increase would raise about $650 million a
year, bringing the state's annual revenue from cigarette taxes to
nearly $1.8 billion in a $99-billion budget.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in future years, some of the extra tax would be spent on
tobacco control, Kennedy said. But now, the state faces an emergency
situation.</TE>
<TE>   California's overall tobacco control budget of $88.3 million would
be down from about $134 million last year. Money earmarked for
anti-tobacco ads would be cut to $21 million, down from $45 million
last year. Researchers have called the ad campaign a main reason for
the decline in smoking since the program began in 1989. It's a
program that the tobacco industry has long tried to blunt.</TE>

<HD>Welfare Study Finds Big Need for Child Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Welfare recipients in Los Angeles County say inadequate and expensive
child care is the major impediment to getting and keeping a job,
according to a large-scale study released Tuesday by county
officials.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the county must provide better education and training
programs, respondents said, if they are to gain real
self-sufficiency.</LD>
<LD>   The study, "Running Out of Time: Voices of Parents Struggling to
Move from Welfare to Work," was commissioned by the Los Angeles
County Children's Planning Council and conducted by the Economic
Roundtable, a nonprofit social research group.</LD>
<TE>   Over a three-week period in April and May, it surveyed more than
8,500 current and past welfare recipients, as well as poor people who
had never received cash assistance under the CalWORKS welfare-to-work
program.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was to learn the priorities of welfare recipients and
working poor families, and how best the county can help them get
jobs. The results are intended to be used as a blueprint for
allocating county welfare resources.</TE>
<TE>   For example, one group of respondents surveyed at a Los Angeles
food bank said child care services are fundamental, and complained
that in their community a good day-care center charged as much as
$300 a week, far too costly for their limited means. Among the
study's major findings:</TE>
<TE>   * Some 26% of CalWORKS recipients were employed at the time of the
survey; 43% had worked during the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   * Respondents who worked the previous year typically had more
years of school than those who were unemployed (10.6 years versus 9.6
years).</TE>
<TE>   "What stands out in the study is that there is a misperception
that families don't want to work," said Yolie Flores Aguilar,
executive director of the Children's Planning Council. "But this is a
message loud and clear that they want to make it, to do good by their
families, but that they can't make it alone."</TE>

<HD>Carmona Is Easily Confirmed as New U.S. Surgeon General</HD>
<DH>Health: The 52-year-old Arizonan is confirmed on unanimous
vote in the Senate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>On a unanimous voice vote, the Senate Tuesday confirmed Arizona
trauma surgeon and SWAT team deputy Richard H. Carmona as surgeon
general.</LD>
<LD>   Carmona will be commissioned as a three-star admiral in the public
health corps, commanding more than 5,600 commissioned officers,
although he will have only a small staff.</LD>
<LD>   Successful surgeons general have taken advantage of the bully
pulpit of their office to promote public health causes.</LD>
<TE>   ''The surgeon general is one of this country's leaders on matters
of public health, and Dr. Carmona will be a strong and vigorous
leader in our efforts to combat chronic conditions and lead this
nation to better health,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy
G. Thompson said after he was confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   The 52-year-old Carmona faced tough, although cordial, questions
at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions Committee earlier this month about his rocky
tenure as a health-care manager in Arizona and his struggles to
become board-certified as a surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   Committee chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said at the hearing
that he found Carmona's responses satisfactory, and he endorsed the
nomination. Carmona told the committee, he would focus on preventing
problems: encouraging Americans to lose weight, exercise, eat
healthily and stop smoking. He also said he plans to use his
experience in bioterrorism preparedness to reduce risks to Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona, who was born to Puerto Rican parents in New York City,
was a high school dropout and street gang member before a chance
encounter with an Army major changed his life. He enlisted and served
as a Green Beret in Vietnam.He later attended medical school at UC
San Francisco and was chosen by classmates to give the valedictory
speech at graduation.</TE>
<TE>   In Tucson, where he moved to head the new trauma center at a
hospital, Carmona gained local fame for his exploits as a deputy on
the Pima County Sheriff's Department SWAT team. He helped save a man
stranded on a mountaintop in a daring helicopter rescue, and he
killed an armed suspect in a shootout at a busy city intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Some former colleagues said his abrasive style made working with
him difficult. Carmona twice sued his first Tucson employer, Tucson
Medical Center, winning a multimillion-dollar breach-of-contract
action and a public apology. He later resigned as head of the
county's health system shortly before the commissioners planned to
vote him out.</TE>

<HD>In Tragedy, an Emotional Surge in Citizenship Hopes</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Fears of INS scrutiny, and a dose of
patriotism, motivate applicants.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Requests for U.S. citizenship have soared this year, driven in large
part by the emotional and legal ripple effects of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, according to immigrants and those who counsel them
on adjusting to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   For many longtime residents, the tragic events stirred patriotic
feelings, sparking long-delayed decisions to formalize their American
identity and take the oath of citizenship. Others, anxious about the
Justice Department's more aggressive pursuit of immigration law
violators, have sought shelter in legal protections that come only
with citizenship.</LD>
<LD>   Just Monday, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft announced that the Justice
Department would expect full compliance with a widely ignored rule
that noncitizens report any address changes or risk criminal
penalties, including possible deportation.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to have rights in this country," said Anacleto Nieves, 36,
a Mexico native who is raising his family in Pico Rivera and recently
became a citizen after 17 years in this country. "When you are an
American citizen, you have security to stay in this country. It's
different when you are only a resident."</TE>
<TE>   Nieves took the oath of citizenship in May. His wife's application
is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, requests for citizenship surged 65% during the eight
months after Sept. 11, according to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, with a leap of more than 100% in Los Angeles.
In May, the most recent month for which national figures are
available, they jumped 121% from the same month in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Close observers trace the increase to all kinds of people. "It's
not based on ethnicity," said J. Kevin Appleby, director of migration
and refugee policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. "It's
not just Middle Easterners. It's in all the immigrant communities."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Sept. 11 the only cause. A 2001 law that streamlined the
citizenship process for the children of those who take the oath may
have encouraged some parents to move forward. Fee hikes for INS
fingerprinting and citizenship applications that took effect in
February, raising the combined cost from $250 to $310, touched off a
mini-stampede the month before.</TE>
<TE>   A flurry of high-profile mayoral races involving Latino candidates
in Los Angeles, New York, Houston, San Antonio and other cities may
also have inspired some immigrants to seek citizenship--and the right
to vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of the buzz around those elections and around those
candidates may have had an impact on immigrants' decisions," said
Rosalind Gold, senior director of policy research and advocacy with
the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.</TE>
<TE>   Not Feeling Welcome</TE>
<TE>   On the street, some of these factors have blended together
unpredictably. Antonio Martinez, 60, a factory worker from Cudahy who
passed the citizenship exam Tuesday, said he interpreted recent INS
fee increases as a sign of less-welcoming attitudes toward immigrants
after Sept. 11. (In fact, the INS formally announced its plan on Aug.
8 to hike fees.)</TE>
<TE>   "After the rates went up, I started to see that this country
didn't want any more people becoming citizens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who is from Mexico, said he was concerned that he would
not be welcome in the United States if he did not become a citizen.
But more than that, he said his decision reflected his gratitude for
his adopted land.</TE>
<TE>   "We love this country," Martinez said. "This country opened its
arms for us. This country gave us jobs. This country gave us schools.
This country gave us everything. In my opinion, this is the best
country in the world. I want to be part of it. You cannot be part of
the country if you're not a citizen."</TE>
<TE>   It is a conclusion that some immigrants reach only gradually.
Martinez and others said they were wary of losing money to
unscrupulous operators who prey on immigrant communities with
promises of helping them gain citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   The citizenship exam itself, which touches on U.S. history,
government and English proficiency, can be a source of anxiety.
Finally, some are reluctant to abandon dreams of returning to their
homeland or demoting it to second place in their national allegiance.</TE>
<TE>   When one immigrant makes the leap, it can motivate relatives or
friends to follow suit. "For every new citizen, there's often someone
waiting in the wings," said Jeff Chenoweth, division director for the
Catholic Legal Immigration Network.</TE>
<TE>   The number who have to wait has increased this year, as the INS
has subjected applicants to more stringent criminal background
checks. The number of requests approved from October through May
(337,590) was down 10% from the year before, when the INS was
reducing a big backlog.</TE>
<TE>   'We Weren't Prepared'</TE>
<TE>   For those who work closely with immigrants, this year's surge in
applications has been a surprise. Nelly Paredes, who runs the 605
Citizenship Project, named for a freeway corridor that cuts through
many immigrant neighborhoods east of downtown Los Angeles, said its
Saturday sessions used to draw 12 to 18 people. This year, the number
is closer to 50.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't prepared for all these people," said Paredes, whose
program in Santa Fe Springs coaches immigrants on the INS exam and
their responsibilities as U.S. citizens. "I had to go out to buy more
chairs. We now have 50 chairs."</TE>
<TE>   Nieves is among those who have recently filled those chairs. In an
interview, the father of three said many immigrants initially put off
the idea of becoming citizens: "All the people, when they come to
this country, say, 'I love my [home] country. I won't change my
country.' But when time passes, you think different."</TE>
<TE>   Nieves said he could not help but notice that, after Sept. 11, the
Justice Department detained and deported noncitizens who had not
committed terrorism. "I don't know what will happen in the future to
other [noncitizens]," he said. "I want to have rights in this
country. It's hard. Somebody else can decide for you."</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree that noncitizens have become more vulnerable to
deportation. To the surprise of immigrant advocates, the Justice
Department this week made clear that noncitizens risked serious
penalties if they failed to report changes of address within 10 days.
For decades, immigrants have generally been allowed to ignore the
50-year-old rule.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Shusterman, a former INS prosecutor, recalled that, when he
left in the early 1980s, the agency had "just let it fall by the
wayside, even though it was still on the books."</TE>
<TE>   Plan for Local Police</TE>
<TE>   Immigrant advocates also are nervously following Justice
Department plans to involve local police in the pursuit of certain
immigrants whose names have been posted on a national criminal
database.</TE>
<TE>   "I just see this in every way--from the attorney general on down
to the lowest person at INS--a real tightening up of control over
people who are noncitizens, even in areas that have nothing to do
with terrorism whatsoever," maintained Shusterman, now an immigration
lawyer in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   So far, today's citizenship boomlet echoes a more massive movement
in the mid-1990s, when millions who had been granted amnesty were
becoming eligible to become citizens. Also at that time, an
anti-immigrant backlash--symbolized by California's Proposition 187,
which would have closed off most state services to undocumented
immigrants--galvanized many newcomers to seek their voting rights.</TE>
<TE>   Applications for citizenship peaked at more than 1.4 million in
1997, although the actual number approved had topped out at more than
1 million the year before. By 1998, the numbers began to plunge,
bottoming out at about 460,000 applications in 2000. The current
pace, if maintained, would exceed 800,000 requests for the year,
higher than all but the top years of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Return of '90s Anxieties</TE>
<TE>   If the clamor for citizenship is starting to remind some of
earlier years, so is the rising political anxiety of many immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "The apprehension that we saw in the middle 1990s is to a great
extent reappearing now," said Sergio Bendixen, a Miami-based pollster
and political analyst. "I have seen a lot of it in focus groups. I
have seen a lot of it in polling that I've done."</TE>
<TE>   As one barometer of fear, Bendixen in May asked a national sample
of Latino voters whether they felt more or less secure in their daily
lives since Sept. 11. Two-thirds of those who had been born outside
the United States felt less secure, compared with half the overall
sample.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have an accent, if you're from outside the United States,
if you're not a citizen, people fear that difficult times are
coming," Bendixen said.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the current surge is driven only by fear. Greg Simons,
who teaches a course on citizenship at Southwest College in Los
Angeles, recalled how older students sometimes hesitated when he
would ask their willingness to bear arms on behalf of the United
States, a time-honored part of the oath.</TE>
<TE>   But when he posed the question recently among a class whose median
age is in the mid-40s, Simons said that "without any hesitation,
everybody raised their hand and said yes. There is this higher sense
of patriotism and defense of all that they've invested throughout
their lives here."</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Martinez, the factory worker. Not only did he pass the
exam last week, but so did his wife, Hortencia.</TE>
<TE>   Two of his children were born in this country, and he hopes the
other five will join them in citizenship soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big celebration when you become a U.S. citizen," Martinez
said. "It's good. It's the best thing you can do in this life. You
probably don't know because you were born here. It's nothing new for
you.</TE>
<TE>   "But to all of us who came from Mexico, without any money, without
any jobs, without a house, it's a big thing when you become an
American citizen."</TE>

<HD>House Votes to Lift Curbs on U.S. Travel to Cuba</HD>
<DH>Politics: Lawmakers cut off funding to enforce policy.
Opposed to move, Bush vows veto.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House voted Tuesday night to lift restrictions on travel to Cuba,
signaling growing opposition to the 42-year-old economic embargo and
setting up a likely collision with President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   By a vote of 262 to 167, lawmakers voted to cut off the federal
funds used to enforce restrictions on travel to the island. A Senate
committee has adopted similar language. Bush has vowed to give the
bill the first veto of his term if the provision survives the
forthcoming House-Senate conference.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, the White House said the president would be urged
to veto the spending bill if it contains an end to the travel ban.
"Lifting the sanctions now would provide a helping hand to a
desperate and repressive regime," it said.</LD>
<TE>   Leading the fight for the change was a coalition of farm-state
Republicans and northeastern Democrats who have battled Cuban
Americans and their allies in the White House and Congress over the
issue. "Americans can travel to North Korea and Iran, two-thirds of
the axis of evil, but not to Cuba," said Rep. William D. Delahunt
(D-Mass.). "That makes no sense, I would suggest."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the embargo--implemented when Cuba nationalized
foreign companies and other property in 1960--have long contended
that the United States needs to limit trade with and travel to the
island nation, about 90 miles south of Florida, to hasten the
downfall of President Fidel Castro and his communist government. But
the reformers contend that the embargo has failed to accomplish this,
and that the better way to move toward a new regime is to step up the
interaction between impoverished Cuba and the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to change Cuba "is to have American travelers ... and
American ideas go to Cuba," said Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who
sponsored the proposal as an amendment to the $18.5-billion
Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. "For 42 years, we've had
the same failed policy."</TE>
<TE>   Under the ban, only academics, researchers, journalists,
missionaries and Cuban Americans can travel to Cuba legally. Even
Cuban Americans have only a limited travel privilege, although
enforcement of the rules is generally acknowledged to be spotty, and
Americans can get to Cuba by traveling through a third country.</TE>
<TE>   By unofficial estimates, Americans make 176,000 trips to the
island a year. Some analysts believe that the largest single group
traveling to the island is Cuban Americans making multiple trips.</TE>
<TE>   Also adopted, 251-177, was an amendment from Flake that would cut
off funds to enforce restrictions on the amount of money Americans
can send to their family and friends in Cuba. Current rules, which
are rarely enforced, permit Americans to send a maximum of $1,200 a
year to the island.</TE>
<TE>   The House defeated, 204-226, an amendment from Rep. Charles B.
Rangel (D-N.Y.) that would have cut off federal funds used to enforce
all aspects of the embargo.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has shown a gradually increasing desire to ease the
embargo. Last year, a proposal to do so passed the House, 240-186.
But it was dropped before the Senate completed action on the bill to
avoid any partisan clash in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Farm-state lawmakers believe that opening trade with Cuba promises
them a major market for their products. Some agricultural advocates
have contended that annual U.S. farm sales to Cuba could be more than
$1 billion a year. But defenders of the embargo scoff at such
estimates and say that Cuba is a deeply indebted country that has
proved a tough market.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who is keenly interested in political support from Florida,
where his brother Jeb is running for reelection as governor this
year, has stood strongly behind the Cuban American community. But
congressional analysts said he would probably prefer to avoid a veto
of the appropriations bill, which would force Congress to start over
on critical legislation in an election year when lawmakers want to be
out campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury-Postal appropriations bill focuses primarily on law
enforcement and anti-terrorism programs, increasing funds for the
Customs Service to tighten border controls.</TE>

<HD>Senior Drug Plans Killed</HD>
<DH>Senate: Competing GOP and Democratic bills are defeated,
leaving little hope for a measure this year to ease prescription
costs under Medicare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Tuesday defeated two plans--one from each party--that
would have helped the elderly pay for soaring prescription drug
costs, leaving scant hope that the impasse on the issue will be
broken this year.</LD>
<LD>   In back-to-back votes, senators failed to approve either a
Democratic plan to add a drug benefit to Medicare or a less-expensive
Republican alternative that would rely largely on the private sector
to provide the coverage. Either alternative would have represented
the biggest expansion of government aid to the elderly since Medicare
was established in 1965.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a vote about national character and priorities," said
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), one of the few still in the Senate
who served in 1965.</LD>
<TE>   But neither alternative garnered the 60 votes needed under Senate
budget rules. The vote for the Democratic alternative was 52 to 47;
the GOP version failed to win even a bare majority, losing 48 to 51.</TE>
<TE>   After the votes, key senators said they would go back to the
negotiating table to see whether a compromise between the two
measures could be cobbled together and passed in the next week. Most
lawmakers, however, see only bleak prospects for crafting a measure
that could clear the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I think it is not particularly likely," said Sen.
Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.). "The proper coalition still has not
formed, and there are still too many differences."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), who is central to efforts to draft a
compromise, gave the enterprise no more than a 50-50 chance of
succeeding. "It's possible, but it's no cinch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats have expressed growing anxiety that if Congress
comes up empty-handed, lawmakers will suffer the wrath of elderly
voters who are growing weary of politicians making promises on drug
coverage that they fail to fulfill. "To go home without getting
anything done is simply not an option," said Sen. Zell Miller
(D-Ga.).</TE>
<TE>   But with an eye on the November elections, many Democrats intend
to portray Republicans as the principal obstacle to enacting
prescription drug coverage. Many Republicans are hoping they have
neutralized the issue by backing a version of their own.</TE>
<TE>   But some conservatives welcome the stalemate, saying even the GOP
plan would be unaffordable at a time of burgeoning federal budget
deficits. John C. Goodman, president of the National Center for
Policy Analysis, a Washington-based think tank, said both parties are
"engaged in a shameless bidding war to court elderly voters."
Enactment of either Senate proposal, he said, would "mortgage the
future of our children and grandchildren."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say the Medicare issue may end up being less
important to the 2002 elections than once may have been expected.
That's because the sense of economic insecurity prompted by the
tumbling stock market and the threat of terrorist attack have come to
dominate the political scene. "There are so many other issues on the
agenda ... the stock market, terrorism, the war overseas," said
Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy at Harvard University.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate may end up passing a narrowly focused measure to curb
drug costs by making it harder for brand-name drug companies to delay
bringing cheaper generic drugs to market. That generic-drug bill has
served as the vehicle for a broader debate about providing a
prescription drug benefit. Democratic leaders arranged for the major
proposals to be offered as amendments to the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The chief Democratic plan, whose sponsors include Kennedy and
Miller, would cost an estimated $600 billion over seven years to
provide a government-administered drug benefit through Medicare. GOP
critics called it a budget-busting expansion of bureaucracy that's
unaffordable.</TE>
<TE>   Most Republicans support an alternative that would cost $370
billion over 10 years. But rather than making the benefit part of
Medicare, it would instead pay subsidies to private insurers that
provide drug coverage to the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic critics said the plan, like a similar one recently
passed by the House, would leave too much to the initiative of
private insurers and fail to guarantee that affordable benefits would
be available throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers say it will be easier to reach a compromise on cost than
it will be to bridge divisions over how the benefits should be
delivered. That dispute pits the GOP's preference for private-sector
solutions and market competition against Democrats' insistence on
government-guaranteed benefits through Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   One idea being discussed is to begin the program as a
government-guaranteed benefit but gradually phase in a larger role
for private insurers. Breaux expressed skepticism that such a blend
was practical.</TE>
<TE>   The split between the parties was evident Tuesday: The Democratic
alternative was supported by 50 Democrats and two others: the
Senate's lone independent, James M. Jeffords of Vermont, and one
Republican, Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois. Voting against it were 47
Republicans. The GOP alternative was backed by 45 Republicans,
Jeffords and two Democrats: Breaux and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.
Opposing it were 48 Democrats and three Republicans.</TE>

<HD>Fish and Game's Enemy No. 1: The Snakehead</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Spot on 'injurious wildlife' list would make it
illegal to import predator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Their voracious appetites, canine-like teeth and rare ability to
wiggle across dry land have earned the 28 species of snakehead fish a
spot on the U.S. government's most-wanted list for wildlife, Interior
Secretary Gale A. Norton said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   She proposed designating snakeheads--which are known by a variety
of derogatory nicknames, including frankenfish--as "injurious
wildlife." That would make it illegal to import them or to transport
them across state lines.</LD>
<LD>   "These fish are like something from a bad horror movie," Norton
said at a news conference. "These fish are top-level predators.
They'll eat virtually anything in their path."</LD>
<TE>   If they spread, she said, they could threaten scores of endangered
freshwater creatures and destroy the delicate ecological balance in
ponds and streams across the country. Currently, 13 states make it
illegal to possess the fish, which are shaped like torpedoes and get
their name from the large scales on their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Snakeheads' natural range includes parts of Africa and Asia, but
scientists have found four species in seven U.S. states, including
California. About 17,000 snakeheads have been legally imported over
the last several years for food and as pets. Experts believe some of
these fish were released into U.S. waters, either to dispose of them
or to establish a local source of the fish to use as food.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, one snakehead was collected from Silverwood Lake in the
San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles. It was the only
snakehead found in the state, according to Marshall Jones, deputy
director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency of the Interior
Department.</TE>
<TE>   The only known U.S. snakehead populations in the wild are in
Maryland and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   A reproducing population of bullseye snakeheads was found in
Broward County, Fla., last year. This is the largest species of
snakehead and can grow to be 4 feet long and weigh up to 44 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, an angler caught a smaller variety of snakehead
in a pond in Maryland and showed a photo of it to state officials. So
far, two adult fish and about 100 juveniles have been found in that
pond. Maryland officials, worried that the fish might spread, plan to
administer poison to kill every snakehead in the pond, said Eric C.
Schwaab, head of Maryland's Department of Natural Resources Fisheries
Service.</TE>
<TE>   If allowed to spread beyond the pond, Schwaab said, snakeheads
could be extremely difficult to eradicate. They are hearty fish and
multiply extremely rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, snakeheads are widely available in live-food fish
markets and some restaurants in Boston and New York, officials said.
Since snakeheads are air breathers, they can be easily shipped via
air freight, which probably has contributed to their increased
availability in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The remarkable fish can live out of water for three days because
it can breathe air. It eats other fish and sea creatures, birds and
sometimes mammals.</TE>
<TE>   Snakeheads are believed to be monogamous, and they are very
protective of their young. Norton said that, according to reports
from Asia, they have even attacked humans when they felt their
offspring were threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Officials asked for the public's assistance in preventing the
introduction of snakeheads into the country's rivers and lakes.
Anyone who wants to dispose of a snakehead should turn it over to a
state fish and game official or kill it at home by putting it in the
freezer.</TE>
<TE>   Under no circumstances should a snakehead be released into a
waterway or flushed down a toilet, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Norton's announcement Tuesday was just a proposal, she
made it quite clear that she expects snakeheads to be added to the
"injurious wildlife" list within a few months, after the public has
had a chance to comment on it.</TE>
<TE>   They will join a variety of other aquatic invaders, such as the
walking catfish and foreign salmon, which are banned for fear that
they could spread disease.</TE>
<TE>   Norton said the snakehead's "celebrity" had given her an
opportunity to highlight the threat of invasive species to U.S.
ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, some of the most threatening aquatic invaders are the
mitten crab, which was discovered in San Francisco Bay in 1992 and
which threatens native invertebrates, and the zebra mussel, which
threatens native sea creatures by eating available food.</TE>
<TE>   The zebra mussel has spread up and down the Mississippi River and
into at least 20 states and two Canadian provinces. It has cost
Americans millions of dollars by clogging power plant and public
water intakes and pipes.</TE>
<TE>   At the news conference, Schwaab was asked whether Maryland had
considered bringing in a natural predator of the snakehead to take
care of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to go down that road," Schwaab said.</TE>

<HD>Address Policy 'Unfair'</HD>
<DH>Security: Requiring noncitizens to report when they move
could hurt innocent, some say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Justice Department decision to enforce--with fines or deportation
possible--a long-neglected law requiring noncitizens to report
address changes has enraged some immigrant advocates in Southern
California, where more than 1 million residents will be affected by
the new policy.</LD>
<LD>   Civil liberties and immigrant rights workers said
otherwise-law-abiding residents could be severely punished, either
mistakenly or for minor, inadvertent offenses.</LD>
<LD>   "It's outrageous. It's terribly unfair when you have a law on the
books for so long, then spring it on people," said Mark Yoshida, a
lawyer who works on immigration and citizenship cases for the Asian
Pacific American Legal Center in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Yoshida fears that immigrants who don't find out about the new
enforcement policy could face unreasonably harsh treatment. "Some
people could be subjected to some pretty severe penalties. It boggles
the mind," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to strictly uphold the 50-year-old law were announced Monday
as part of an effort begun before Sept. 11 to improve the system of
tracking foreign visitors and residents. Those who are older than 14
and living in the United States legally but are not citizens would
have to report changes of address within 10 days of moving or risk
fines, jail and deportation.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 million residents of Los Angeles County and 100,000 in
Orange County are subject to the requirement.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer number of people to be tracked, in an area where the
Immigration and Naturalization Service is already overwhelmed by its
workload, has left some skeptical of the agency's ability to
successfully implement the plan. Yoshida said that each month his
office assists 50 to 100 citizenship applicants. Each month, two or
three cases typically emerge in which applicants tell the INS of an
address change but the agency fails to update its records, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can't handle the situation now, what happens when they're
faced with implementing the new law?" Yoshida asked.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin Wizner, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union
of Southern California, also questioned the INS' ability to track
such a large number of people. "Obviously, the government does not
have the capability to track the movements of millions of residents.
I fear there will be selective enforcement. The government may use
its vast powers to target individuals or groups on the basis of
national origin or race," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fair enforcement was also the concern of Mahmoud Abdel-Baset,
religious and social services coordinator of the Islamic Center of
Southern California. "As long as Muslims are not singled out, we
would not object," he said. "It has to be applicable to everybody."</TE>
<TE>   But Angelica Salas, executive director of the Los Angeles-based
Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, said the new policy itself
places an unfair burden on noncitizens. Salas said the policy imposes
on the privacy rights of lawful residents. "It is an unnecessary
singling out of hard-working people who are in every other way living
like citizens," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Salas said the policy change could prompt more legal residents to
become citizens for practical reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "The motivation [to seek citizenship] should be a positive
decision based on the ideals of our country. Now people are going to
say, 'I'd better become a citizen to protect myself,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Salas said a rush of citizenship applications would also place
more demands on the INS, making it even more difficult to manage the
task of keeping up with address changes.</TE>

<HD>Spy Agencies Absorb Criticism Before Budget Hearing</HD>
<DH>Security: The struggling effort to question Afghanistan
captives hints at larger problems, a report says. Lawmakers express
frustration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. spy agencies have stumbled badly in their efforts to get
information out of Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, a setback symbolic of broader breakdowns in the intelligence
community, according to a new report from the House Intelligence
Committee.</LD>
<LD>   In a sharply worded critique attached to an intelligence funding
bill scheduled for debate today, the committee criticizes leaders at
the CIA and other agencies for allowing an array of problems to
persist, and in some cases worsen, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Among the problems cited in the report are questionable spending
decisions, inadequate efforts in recruiting linguists and analysts,
and resistance among various agencies to sharing critical
information.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, the report says, the United States remains vulnerable
to "further surprise in national security areas," and the
intelligence community "gives little indication" that it is
mobilizing quickly enough to confront looming threats.</TE>
<TE>   The pointed criticism provides a glimpse of the mood of key
lawmakers as the intelligence community faces considerable scrutiny
on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate intelligence committees are in the midst of a
broad investigation of intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11.
And a House subcommittee last week released a report criticizing the
CIA and other agencies for failing to devote adequate resources to
tracking Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations before last
September's deadly attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The authorization bill scheduled for debate today echoes that
complaint, saying top intelligence officials "did not take into
account sufficiently the complexity and importance of the growing
threat from terrorism associated with Islamic fundamentalism."</TE>
<TE>   The criticism comes at a time when lawmakers appear inclined to
lavish the nation's spy agencies with billions of dollars in
additional funding but are showing growing impatience with the pace
at which the CIA and other agencies are responding to calls for
reform.</TE>
<TE>   "There really is going to need to be major progress soon," said
Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), a member of the House committee. She
said members are particularly concerned that shortcomings identified
repeatedly in recent years, including the shortage of analysts and
linguists, haven't been adequately addressed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating," she said. "We're using [the authorization
bill] as leverage to send some messages. I don't think when next year
comes around there's going to be any interest in starting over
[addressing] the linguist problem."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), the chairman of the House Select
Committee on Intelligence, was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The authorization bill is the first intelligence spending bill to
be drafted since September's terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon. The bill is essentially a spending plan for
spy agencies for the coming fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has requested a substantial increase in funding
for intelligence agencies next year, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   Actual budget figures are classified, but spending on the nation's
13 spy agencies is believed to hover in the range of $30 billion to
$35 billion.</TE>
<TE>   While noting that it supports the White House's funding request,
the committee made clear in its attached report that it has
significant concerns about the way the money might be spent.</TE>
<TE>   The spy community has shown little indication, the report says,
"of being prepared to produce intelligence capabilities that can
address the national security demands of the future."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the report finds serious flaws with ongoing operations in
the war on terrorism. Committee members who made several trips to the
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, where Al Qaeda prisoners are being
interrogated by the CIA and the FBI, found "problems that have
plagued the intelligence community writ large over a number of
years."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, they pointed to shortages of linguists,
interrogators and intelligence officers. Interagency cooperation has
also "been an issue," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers were left with the impression, the report says, that the
operation was considered a "low priority" for leaders of the
intelligence community, even though the prisoners at Guantanamo are
said to be among the highest-ranking Al Qaeda operatives captured in
the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Harman said there is some evidence that the operation at
Guantanamo has improved since committee members visited the facility
in the spring and that it is "contributing now in a substantial way"
to counterterrorism efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The report singles out the National Security Agency, responsible
for intercepting electronic communication around the globe, for
wasting money trying to develop technology already available from
industry. The NSA has faced mounting criticism in recent years for
falling behind technologically.</TE>
<TE>   The report criticizes Pentagon management of a program to develop
unmanned airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, the House committee complains that the CIA and other
agencies have not done enough to shore up their analytical
capabilities, meaning the amount of information collected vastly
outstrips the agencies' ability to make sense of it.</TE>
<TE>   The bill makes recommendations to address these problems. One
calls for an "Intelligence Community Language University" to provide
advanced training.</TE>

<HD>Air Security Deadline Not on Track</HD>
<DH>Security: Mineta warns Congress that budget cuts will
probably delay airport screening goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration all but conceded Tuesday that it will not be
able to deliver on a promised federal aviation security system that
combines the best in protection and passenger convenience by the end
of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Either congressional deadlines for federal security screeners and
bomb detection technology will go unmet or the effort to meet them
will result in long lines for travelers, Transportation Secretary
Norman Y. Mineta told the House aviation subcommittee. Lawmakers
could extend the deadlines, but Mineta did not ask for that.</LD>
<LD>   Mineta said the blame for any failure to meet security deadlines
should rest squarely on Congress for delaying and scaling back a
request by President Bush for $4.4 billion in emergency funds for the
new Transportation Security Administration.</LD>
<TE>   The acrimonious Capitol Hill hearing came less than a week after
the head of the agency resigned amid complaints that it is
disorganized and heavy-handed. The turmoil could well renew
travelers' concerns about their safety, and a growing number of
lawmakers and independent experts are calling for mid-course
corrections to the federal takeover of aviation security.</TE>
<TE>   "We could truly be looking at a national embarrassment, with
check-in waits of up to three hours," said Kevin Mitchell, head of
the Business Travel Coalition. "We don't want to have to do this two
times: once to meet a deadline and a second time because we weren't
doing it right the first time."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress passed legislation
requiring that federal employees take over passenger screening by
Nov. 19 of this year and that all checked luggage be screened with
explosive-detection technology by Dec. 31. But Mineta said lawmakers
have now jeopardized the agency's mission.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional funding level "simply will not support the
mandates and timetables for aviation security that Congress set last
fall for TSA," Mineta said. "Less money with no flexibility means
fewer TSA employees, less equipment, longer lines, delay in reducing
the hassle factor at airports and/or diminished security."</TE>
<TE>   Congress Cuts Funding</TE>
<TE>   Congress reduced the Bush request from $4.4 billion to $3.85
billion and set various restrictions and conditions on how $925
million of that could be spent. Lawmakers also capped the agency's
work force at 45,000, while agency officials estimate 67,000 will be
needed to screen passengers and luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta said Bush intends to make a request for more money for
fiscal year 2003, which begins Oct. 1. But even that would probably
come too late.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confronted with a load that the TSA cannot lift," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers reacted angrily to Mineta's statements, suggesting
that he was trying to make a scapegoat of Congress for his own
department's failings.</TE>
<TE>   "I am really upset with your performance," said Rep. Peter A.
DeFazio (D-Ore.), pounding the dais with his hand. "It's unbelievable
to me." Mineta is a former chairman of the aviation panel; he and
DeFazio were colleagues in the House.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few days ago, Mineta had assured Congress that security
deadlines would be met, said Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). "You made
a clean and unequivocal statement," said Menendez, who had questioned
Mineta on the subject last week at a hearing on the proposed Homeland
Security Department.</TE>
<TE>   On a related subject, Mineta testified that a program approved by
the House to allow pilots to be trained and armed as special air
marshals would cost an estimated $860 million to create and $250
million a year to operate. Mineta said he remains opposed to arming
pilots, but he said the idea is getting a second look in view of its
overwhelming support in the House.</TE>
<TE>   Trusted Traveler Plan</TE>
<TE>   Another popular idea getting a closer look is a trusted traveler
program that would allow frequent fliers who pass a background check
to speed through airport security. "There is absolutely no doubt that
some of the hassle [will be reduced by] a trusted traveler program of
some kind," said James Loy, the retired Coast Guard admiral who has
been nominated to become the new head of the security agency. His
predecessor, John W. Magaw, had been wary of the proposal, which is
strongly backed by airlines and travel groups.</TE>
<TE>   No matter who heads the agency, it faces the bureaucratic
equivalent of "Mission: Impossible," suggested Alexis Stefani, an
assistant inspector general who also testified at the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "TSA could not be working any faster or harder than it already
is," Stefani said. But the goals for federal screeners and
explosive-detection technology are getting no easier to reach.</TE>
<TE>   The agency will have to hire and train 7,600 screeners a month to
meet the Nov. 19 deadline for an all-federal force. As of mid-July,
it had hired 2,475 of the estimated 33,000 checkpoint screeners
needed, and 4,000 more had accepted job offers.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency has run into major difficulty hiring screeners in
urban areas and finding enough women who want to take the jobs, she
said. The agency had set a goal that half of its screeners would be
women because of complaints about searches of females by male
security guards.</TE>
<TE>   'Monumental' Challenge</TE>
<TE>   As for explosives detection, Stefani said the agency must buy and
install 1,000 minivan-size CT scanners and 5,600 smaller
trace-detection units to meet the Dec. 31 deadline. The number of
machines needed at U.S. airports is more than three times the amount
of explosive-detection equipment currently deployed in the entire
world, she said. "The challenge ... is both unprecedented and
monumental," Stefani testified.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation subcommittee chairman John L. Mica (R-Fla.) had argued
all along that the Dec. 31 explosives screening deadline was too
ambitious. Now, several lawmakers are trying to extend the deadline
by one year as part of legislation to create the Homeland Security
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Even a second-grade student will tell you the math on this
project does not work," Mica said. "We must develop a common-sense
backup plan."</TE>

<LD>   The material was requested by the New York Times, which has filed
a suit in state court to obtain the records. Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg has denied the request.</LD>
<TE>   In court documents, the Bloomberg administration said it is not
required to release the radio transmissions and 911 calls because it
could hinder the prosecution of Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person
charged as a Sept. 11 conspirator. He is in a Virginia jail.</TE>
<TE>   City attorneys also said a law enforcement exemption in the
state's freedom of information law applies in this case because the
U.S. attorney's office asked the Fire Department to gather the
transmissions and calls to aid in Moussaoui's prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   David McCraw, an attorney representing the newspaper, said similar
details have already reached the public via a TV documentary and at
least three books.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much information out there that it would hardly
change the balance of Moussaoui getting a fair or impartial jury in
Virginia," McCraw said.</TE>
<TE>   The city said releasing oral histories and transmissions would be
an invasion of privacy for firefighters and their families. It said
the histories constitute interagency reports that will be used for
devising policy, which exempts them from freedom of information laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Both the oral histories and the radio transmissions, especially
the 911 calls, contain highly personal and emotionally charged
material," wrote Michael Cardozo, a city lawyer. "Victims were
experiencing life-threatening circumstances, in some instances as
they were dying."</TE>
<TE>   The Times argues that firefighters were never informed that their
testimony was to remain confidential. The paper also argues the
histories were gathered for historical purposes, not to formulate
policy.</TE>

<HD>Appellate Nominee Assailed by Panel</HD>
<DH>Congress: Democrats say Bush's circuit court choice is
pro-business and anti-consumer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Corporate scandals made their way into a Senate battle over a Texas
judge Tuesday, as Democrats called President Bush's nominee to the
U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, Priscilla R. Owen, a faithful ally
of big business and a foe of injured consumers.</LD>
<LD>   Owen, 47, is an elected justice of the Texas Supreme Court whose
first campaign was run by Karl Rove, now senior advisor to Bush. A
Houstonian, she received $8,600 in campaign contributions from Enron.
And she is a friend of Bush's.</LD>
<LD>   Those facts alone might have drawn extra attention to her
confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. But the
Democrats focused on her business-friendly rulings that have thrown
out jury verdicts or protected insurance companies from being sued.</LD>
<TE>   The Texas Supreme Court hears appeals only in civil cases, not
criminal or death penalty disputes. But the Democrats, who hold a
slim majority on the panel, said Owen stands out as conservative
voice on a conservative court.</TE>
<TE>   However, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the committee's senior
Republican, accused Washington's "professional smear groups" of using
"distortions and demagoguery" against Owen. He noted that she was
rated well-qualified by the American Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In questioning Owen's record, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)
described the case of Willie Searcy, a 14-year-old whose spine was
severed when the seat belt in his father's Ford pickup truck tore
loose in a crash. A jury awarded him and his family $40 million in
damages. An appeals court reduced the amount to $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   When Ford appealed, the Texas high court took up the case, but it
took Owen nearly two years to issue a decision. Her opinion threw out
the verdict because the lawsuit was filed in the wrong place.</TE>
<TE>   "This was very surprising," said Feinstein, who chaired the
hearing. "Two courts had sustained the verdict."</TE>
<TE>   Searcy's family cared for the boy at home for nearly eight years
while the case languished in the courts. The family was unable to
hire nurses to be with him all night.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point, the respirator went out, and he died," Feinstein
said.</TE>
<TE>   Owen said the family's lawyers should have filed the lawsuit in
Dallas, where the accident happened.</TE>
<TE>   "We remanded the case [for a new trial]. He did not pass away
while the case was in our court," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the committee's chairman, cited the
case of a woman who was raped by a salesman working for the Kirby
vacuum cleaner company. Kirby had hired the salesman without checking
his background; he had been fired from his previous job for sexual
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The woman sued Kirby, and a jury awarded her $160,000 in damages.
The Texas court upheld the verdict, but Owen dissented.</TE>
<TE>   The salesman "was an independent contractor," Owen said. Under
basic principles of law, she said, "you are not liable for the
actions of independent contractors."</TE>
<TE>   Unmoved, Leahy said she had sided repeatedly with business and
against plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   "You seem to be outside the mainstream of a very conservative
Texas Supreme Court," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) cited an opinion by Owen that threw
out a jury verdict against Provident American Insurance Co., which
approved a woman's surgery to remove her spleen and gallbladder and
then refused to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "You were the answer to the insurance company's prayer," Durbin
said. "The law is there for little people, not just for the
Providents of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Owen replied that the woman had failed to prove the insurance
company had acted "in bad faith." She agreed the insurance company
should have paid for the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a pattern of siding against consumers and in favor of
corporations and insurance companies, which is very troubling," said
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.)</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein called Owens a "judicial activist" for making it harder
for pregnant teenagers to get an abortion without telling a parent.</TE>
<TE>   "You insisted on conditions that were not in the statute" that
allowed such abortions, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not anti-anything. It was not activism," Owen replied,
saying she was trying to follow the law.</TE>
<TE>   Owen and her defenders accused liberal interest groups of falsely
portraying her record.</TE>
<TE>   "The picture that some special interest groups have painted of me
is wrong," she said. "I recognize the tremendous responsibility that
judges have. For more than seven years, I have tried very hard to
carry out that responsibility fairly and impartially."</TE>
<TE>   The president met with Owen last week to show his support. But she
needs the vote of at least one Democrat on the panel to send her
nomination to the Senate floor.</TE>
<TE>   The committee is unlikely to vote until the fall.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 7, Found Safe After Escaping From Abductors</HD>
<DH>Crime: Erica Pratt, seized outside grandmother's home in
Philadelphia, frees herself and is helped by children playing nearby.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>It is by now a familiar story: A little girl is abducted outside her
house, kicking and screaming, by a man in a car. A 5-year-old
playmate tells the girl's grandmother, then provides crucial
information to police.</LD>
<LD>   But unlike the July 15 sexual assault and murder of 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion, Philadelphia police said Tuesday, 7-year-old Erica
Pratt was abducted outside her grandmother's Southwest Philadelphia
home Monday night by kidnappers who demanded a $150,000 ransom.</LD>
<LD>   And unlike the Southern California case, this abduction ended
fortuitously Tuesday night with Erica's safe return after an
excruciating day for her family. Her mouth taped and her hands bound,
Erica managed to free herself about 8 p.m. after her abductors left
her alone in an abandoned house in North Philadelphia, police said.</LD>
<TE>   The girl made her way to a first-floor window, smashed it and
yelled to two children playing outside, police said. The children
helped her through the window, then summoned two police officers on
patrol in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   As relatives and neighbors whooped and cheered in the rain outside
Erica's rowhouse in a tumbledown neighborhood nine miles away Tuesday
night, the girl was taken to a hospital for observation--and to have
coils of duct tape removed from her hair.</TE>
<TE>   Police continued to search Tuesday night for two heavyset men,
based on detailed descriptions provided by Erica's playmate and a
9-year-old who also witnessed the abduction. Police had earlier
released the names and photos of two men, both with arrest records,
who were sought for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   This was no random abduction by a sexual predator, police said,
but rather a targeted kidnapping by men who apparently knew Erica and
her family. Twenty minutes after Erica was snatched off the street by
a passenger of a passing car while she walked with her 5-year-old
friend, police said, a man telephoned her grandmother and threatened
to kill the girl if the ransom was not paid. At least four more calls
followed, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Her grandmother, Barbara Pratt, was allowed to speak briefly early
Tuesday morning to Erica, who was described as frightened but
unharmed, said Philadelphia Police Inspector William Colarulo.</TE>
<TE>   Colarulo said police believed the kidnappers' motive was money.
"Thank God, we don't believe there is any kind of sexual assault
involved," Colarulo said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the account of the 5-year-old girl, police said, Erica
was grabbed by a man who jumped from the front passenger seat of a
white car and called her by name. The girl resisted and kicked at the
man. The abductor was described as a heavy man "with a big belly,"
wearing a white T-shirt and baseball cap, Colarulo said.</TE>
<TE>   Erica clung to the hand of her friend but was forced into the car
and held on the lap of the man in the passenger seat, police said.
The 5-year-old ran and screamed: "He took Erica! A man took Erica!"</TE>
<TE>   The two girls were returning from a block party two blocks away
and were just a few steps from Erica's house on Kingsessing Street
when she was abducted, police said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth reported abduction since February of a young
girl from her home. In addition to the Samantha Runnion murder,
14-year-old Elizabeth A. Smart was reported abducted by an intruder
from her bedroom in Salt Lake City on June 5. The girl has not been
seen since.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Danielle van Dam, 7, was abducted from her home in
San Diego and murdered. A neighbor has been charged with the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The abduction of children by strangers is rare, according to child
welfare groups, particularly when compared with the number of
children seized by a parent in custody disputes. The FBI investigated
93 abductions of children by strangers last year, a slight decline
over previous years.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department statistics indicate that about three-quarters
of children abducted by strangers are killed within three hours of
their abduction.</TE>
<TE>   Police identified the two men sought for questioning in Erica's
abduction as James Burns, 29, and Edward Johnson, 23. Both men know
Erica's family, police said. Court records show that Burns has been
arrested on gun charges and Johnson, who is on probation, has been
arrested for drug violations.</TE>
<TE>   Colarulo said police had impounded a car believed to have been
used in the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Erica's kidnappers might have believed false rumors in
the neighborhood that Erica's family had received a $150,000
insurance payment in the shooting death of her uncle, Joseph Pratt,
25, whose March 23 slaying is still unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   Pratt, who was facing attempted murder charges, was killed in a
hail of bullets as he sat in a car in West Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Vikki Price, 54, who lives next door to Erica's grandmother, said
Barbara Pratt owns a corner grocery and two houses and is known in
the neighborhood "as a lady who has a little bit of money."</TE>
<TE>   Two hours before Erica was found, her mother pleaded for her safe
return at a candlelight prayer service held a half-block from her
home by neighbors who had spent Monday night searching for the girl.</TE>
<TE>   "I beg you, whoever has Erica, please, please bring her home,"
said Sarina Gillis, Erica's mother, who held up a photo of her
daughter. "I love you, baby. Please come home."</TE>
<TE>   Gillis, who lives one street behind the rowhouse where Erica lives
with her guardian grandmother, described the girl as "a sweet and
loving child."</TE>

<HD>Muslim Activist Is Arrested in Denver</HD>
<DH>Security: James Ujaama is being held as a material witness
as part of a grand jury probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal authorities said Tuesday that they have arrested a Muslim
activist who has been identified in a law enforcement document as a
possible Al Qaeda operative with ties to a radical London cleric, the
Taliban and a terrorist training camp in Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   James Ujaama, 36, was arrested in Denver on Monday on a material
witness warrant, in connection with a federal grand jury
investigation in northern Virginia into terrorist activity in the
United States, a federal law enforcement official said.</LD>
<LD>   Material witness warrants are issued when federal authorities
believe someone has information about a criminal investigation--or is
a suspect--but may be uncooperative or a flight risk.</LD>
<TE>   FBI and Justice Department officials had no comment Tuesday,
referring calls to the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria, Va. A
grand jury at the federal courthouse there has been investigating a
wide range of alleged terrorist activity, including the potential
role alleged conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui may have played in the
Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama, a Seattle resident who also goes by the name Bilal Ahmed,
has denied any wrongdoing, particularly having any ties to terrorist
activity. His mother and other family members confirmed his arrest
and said Ujaama's younger brother Mustafa was briefly detained by
authorities Monday before being released.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported two weeks ago that the FBI had been
investigating Ujaama for his alleged ties to Sheikh Abu Hamza
Al-Masri, an alleged European recruiter for the Al Qaeda terrorist
network based at a London mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also said that they suspect Ujaama helped Abu Hamza
provide the Taliban regime in Afghanistan with computers before Sept.
11 and that he and his brother may have been scouting the northern
United States in recent months for potential targets for a terrorist
attack.</TE>
<TE>   According to the FBI document, James and Mustafa Ujaama were born
in Denver and raised in Seattle under the given names of Earl James
Thompson and Jon Alexander Thompson, 34, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Both brothers converted to Islam and worshiped at several
now-defunct storefront Seattle mosques that the FBI believes were
hotbeds of Muslim radicalism and, potentially, terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also recently arrested the imam, or prayer leader, of
one of the mosques. Semi Osman, an immigrant of apparent Lebanese
origin, was charged with immigration and gun violations. His
attorney, Robert M. Leen, said the government is pressuring Osman for
details about former acquaintances. A search warrant executed at
Osman's home turned up several weapons, Islamic anti-U.S. literature,
military maps and "instructions on poisoning water sources,"
according to FBI documents.</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama's arrest was reported in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
newspaper on Tuesday. FBI agents took him into custody at his aunt's
home, where he had been staying, family members said. Ujaama also has
spent a lot of time in London in recent years, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Ujaama and his brother are anti-drug activists in Seattle.
Some community leaders have publicly decried the FBI's investigation,
saying it is an unfair smear against Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Mustafa Ujaama issued a statement criticizing the investigation.
He said the allegations by the government are "utterly ridiculous"
and emphatically said that neither he nor his brother is a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Ujaama brothers, the Seattle investigation is
focused on a group of American Muslims who the FBI believes may be
working with foreign extremists and who may have been attempting to
sponsor a "jihad training camp" in Oregon in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Mandigo, the FBI chief in Seattle, said last week that the
bureau does not discriminate against Muslims or target mosques or any
other religious institution.</TE>
<TE>   "Any investigations that the FBI may be conducting would be based
on the actions of individuals and not their religion, national
origin, race or any other such characteristics," Mandigo said.</TE>

<HD>House Votes to Aid Pentagon, N.Y. in $28.9-Billion Measure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to clear $28.9 billion in
emergency funding for the Pentagon, U.S. homeland security efforts
and New York's recovery after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate is expected to follow the 397-32 outcome today by
passing the bill and sending it to President Bush, who first
requested it over four months ago, to be signed into law. Lawmakers
last week cut billions in spending from the bill in response to White
House complaints that it had grown too large.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope we can get it to the president's desk as soon as possible
so that our soldiers, our diplomats, our law enforcement and
intelligence officers have the resources they need to protect our
country," said House Appropriations Committee Chairman C.W. "Bill"
Young, a Florida Republican.</LD>
<TE>   The core elements of the 2002 supplemental spending bill enjoy
wide support. But it was slowed by bitter clashes between the White
House, which wanted to limit the cost in the face of mounting U.S.
budget woes, and lawmakers determined to fund their own priorities
ahead of the November elections.</TE>
<TE>   That led the Pentagon to warn that it would run out of money for
vital operations if the measure was not approved by the end of the
month. The Transportation Department also warned that efforts to
overhaul passenger and baggage screening at airports could be
derailed if the deadlock continued.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a reasonable package and I think the most important thing
we can say about it is we simply need to get on with it," said Rep.
David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the Appropriations
Committee, which controls federal spending.</TE>
<TE>   The final bill would provide $14.5 billion for continuing U.S.
operations in Afghanistan and other military needs, as well as $6.7
billion for efforts to bolster U.S. domestic defenses after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $5.5 billion would go to help New York recover from
the destruction of the trade center.</TE>

<HD>2 Held Liable for Salvador Torture</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A Florida jury on Tuesday found two retired generals from El Salvador
liable for torture, rape and other atrocities committed during that
nation's civil war two decades ago, and ordered them to pay $54.6
million to three surviving victims.</LD>
<LD>   Rights activists said that the verdict in a West Palm Beach, Fla.,
federal court was unlikely to lead to any large-scale payout but that
it should help deter other foreigners who are responsible for
killings and other abuses from seeking U.S. residency.</LD>
<LD>   "Now other perpetrators understand that if they come here, we will
find them, we'll find people they've hurt, or the families of those
who have been killed," said Richard Krieger, president of
International Educational Mission, a human rights organization in
Boynton Beach, Fla. The jury in the civil case found that retired
Salvadoran generals Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova and Jose Guillermo
Garcia, both of whom live in Florida, knew their soldiers were
torturing and murdering civilians but did nothing to stop it or to
bring those responsible to account.</LD>
<TE>   "This verdict sends a message to commanders everywhere that they
are responsible for the abuses of the troops they command and they
cannot come to the United States to seek a haven from punishment,"
said James Green, attorney for the three victims.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs--a church worker, doctor and professor--fled their
Central American homeland after being tortured. On July 17, two of
the victims bared their arms to jurors, revealing scars from a
gunshot, cigarette burns and machetes.</TE>
<TE>   The victims, who also are U.S. residents, sued the generals under
a 1991 federal law that empowers American courts to levy damages
against those found responsible of committing human rights abuses
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the plaintiffs, Carlos Mauricio and Neris Gonzalez, were in
the courtroom Tuesday and wept as the verdict was read. Garcia had
been Salvadoran defense minister from 1979 to 1983. Before succeeding
him as the top military official in the U.S.-backed government, Vides
Casanova commanded the national guard. The generals repeatedly said
that they had done nothing wrong but that they could not control
rogue subordinates in the fog of a bitter war against a leftist
insurgency.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt what happened in El Salvador was horrible, that
what happened to these people was horrible. It was a horrible war, a
dirty war," defense lawyer Kurt Klaus Jr. said. "But I don't think
the parties that are responsible for what happened to these people
[the victims] are here."</TE>
<TE>   The attorney told reporters that his clients are unable to pay the
huge amount assessed in damages, and that they couldn't even afford
to appeal. In a similar lawsuit two years ago, the generals, who have
lived in Florida for 13 years, were not found liable for the 1980
torture, rape and murder of four U.S. Catholic missionaries.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Associated Press, Garcia called the decision
"unfair" and said the jury didn't understand the "terrible" violence
in El Salvador. He said one of his goals had been to fight the
brutality. Neither defendant was in court Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   According to a United Nations commission, before peace accords
ended El Salvador's civil war in 1992, half a million people fled
their homes and 75,000 were killed. Most of the refugees and victims
were helpless civilians. The three who sued said Salvadoran police
and soldiers thought they were allied with insurgents.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Romagoza, the physician, said he was beaten, sexually abused
and shot while being held for interrogation. He testified that Vides
Casanova visited him once while he was chained to the floor. A former
surgeon, Romagoza said he can no longer perform operations because
soldiers bound his fingers with wire, making them permanently numb.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, a church worker who had been teaching peasants to count
so they would not be cheated in the marketplace, was abducted when
eight months' pregnant. She was beaten and raped numerous times, then
dumped in a garbage bin with a heap of corpses. She gave birth
prematurely, and her son died two months later from injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Sobbing as she delivered harrowing testimony, Gonzalez, a
56-year-old Chicago resident, said the national guard troops dragged
her to a building whose floor was littered with the body parts of
torture victims.</TE>
<TE>   On the door, she said, the troops had written a sinister name in
blood--El Matadero Humano, or the Human Slaughterhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Mauricio, the university professor, was kidnapped, blindfolded,
strung up by the arms and beaten for eight days at national police
headquarters in San Salvador. The beatings, he said, caused permanent
damage to his vision. The jury awarded $20 million to Romagoza, $21.5
million to Gonzalez, and $13.1 million to Mauricio.</TE>
<TE>   A teary-eyed Gonzalez said: "The money is nice, but it's not the
most important thing. It is knowing that now we have justice."</TE>
<TE>   According to Krieger, whose organization helped compile
information on the generals' alleged actions for use in the trial,
the United States is home to an estimated 1,100 foreigners who
engaged in torture, persecution, killings or other human rights
abuses in other countries.</TE>

<HD>Bush Makes Yucca Mountain Project Official</HD>
<DH>Environment: The president quietly signs a bill making
Nevada site the nation's nuclear waste repository. The issue now
moves into the courts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>President Bush quietly signed a bill Tuesday in Washington formally
adopting Yucca Mountain as the nation's repository for used nuclear
reactor fuel, pushing the 20-year debate on its development into the
scientific and legal arenas.</LD>
<LD>   The Department of Energy is preparing its technical application to
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for approval to construct the
$58-billion project, which it has yet to finish designing. Nevada's
science advisors will use the NRC hearings to argue that the project
is technically flawed and unsafe.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for Nevada, meanwhile, will argue later this year in
federal court that the project is illegal, with hopes of killing it
even before the NRC gets the Yucca Mountain application.</LD>
<TE>   The state's first two lawsuits are expected to be resolved in a
Washington federal appeals court next year. The first one attacks the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's decision that Yucca Mountain
be designed for a safety span of 10,000 years, versus 1 million years
as advised by the National Academy of Sciences. The lawsuit also
challenges EPA standards regulating the amount of radiation that
would be allowed to leak from Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   The next lawsuit challenges the government's decision to rely on
engineered solutions to keep radiation within Yucca Mountain even
though Congress in 1982 mandated that a geologically safe site be
selected.</TE>
<TE>   Government scientists have concluded that Yucca Mountain, which
consists of hardened volcanic ash, is not sufficiently solid to
contain radiation, and opponents say it is rife with water-seeping
fractures that will carry radiation into the desert aquifer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just going after the blatant stuff," said Joseph Egan, the
state's lead attorney, "and we hope judges will look at it and raise
their eyebrows and get indignant. We're in a [court] circuit with a
history of demanding that federal agencies follow the law, whether it
is politically popular or not."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Kenny Guinn remained upbeat Tuesday. "I have always believed
that our best chance in defeating Yucca Mountain is in the federal
courts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevadans, however, seem increasingly resigned that a nuclear dump
at Yucca Mountain seems inevitable. A telephone survey this month for
the Las Vegas Review-Journal found that 49% of the 625 respondents
supported lawsuits to derail Yucca Mountain. However, 43% now want
the state to negotiate benefits in exchange for taking 77,000 tons of
nuclear waste, compared with 23% in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   State officials dismissed the results of the poll as "post-vote
blues" after the House in May and the Senate this month gave the Bush
administration the go-ahead to pursue Yucca Mountain over Guinn's
objections.</TE>
<TE>   The White House on Tuesday took steps to avoid drawing attention
to the bill signing, just as it sought to play down the signing
several months ago of the legislation limiting campaign
contributions. Bush signed the bill with neither reporters nor news
photographers present, and the signing was not placed on his public
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   After the signing, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said
the project would "ensure our nation has a safe and secure
underground facility that will store nuclear waste in a manner that
protects our environment and our citizens."</TE>
<TE>   The material--rods of uranium pellets that are no longer efficient
for nuclear reactors but that will remain highly radioactive for tens
of thousands of years--is stored at 131 power plants and government
sites in 39 states.</TE>
<TE>   Yucca Mountain, about 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is not yet
free of political wrangling. As he has in past years, Sen. Harry Reid
(D-Nev.), the majority whip and a steadfast Yucca Mountain opponent,
is trimming funds for the project's annual operating budget through
his chairmanship of an appropriations subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the administration's request for $445 million in Yucca
Mountain funding was cut 38% by the appropriations subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Bush's request for $525 million for Yucca development
was slashed 36%, to $336 million, by the subcommittee. The full
Appropriations Committee is scheduled to take up the issue today.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Tessa Hafen said Reid cut as much as he could without
offending other committee members who support Yucca Mountain and
jeopardizing the entire appropriations bill, which has "other
worthwhile projects."</TE>
<TE>   The cutbacks have frustrated Energy Department officials, who
won't make a 90-day deadline to get their application to the NRC. The
application won't be ready until December 2004, said Energy
Department spokesman Joe Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "The work we've been able to do reflects the budget we're given to
support the work," Davis said. "At every turn, it's been cut in the
Senate, and we're not getting the money we think is necessary to get
our work done."</TE>
<TE>   The NRC expects to take three years to study the project. The
Department of Energy optimistically hopes to open the facility in
2010.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer James Gerstenzang in Washington contributed to
this report.</TE>

<LD>Florida's 4-2 victory over Montreal on Friday created a real buzz.
And it wasn't because the game marked Cliff Floyd's return to Miami
since being traded to the Expos. The game was delayed for a few
minutes because of a swarm of bees.</LD>
<LD>   The bees provided a bizarre backdrop. There were an estimated
20,000 bees under the seats in Section 145--the box seats behind the
Marlins' dugout.</LD>
<LD>   The section was roped off about 30 minutes before the game, and
the Marlins called in a bee specialist to take care of the problem.</LD>
<TE>   Christian Harveson, who calls himself the Bee Man, went to work,
sucking up the bees with a vacuum cleaner. Harveson arrived wearing a
blue T-shirt, but the Marlins made him put on a Marlin T-shirt and
cap, because they knew he "would get a lot of air time," said P.J.
Loyello, the Marlins' vice president of communications and
broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   "You know he will be on SportsCenter."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Besides Jackie Robinson's, what three uniform numbers
have the San Diego Padres retired?</TE>
<TE>   Question, Mark: Mark Cuban has done wonders as owner of the NBA's
Dallas Mavericks, which is why nearly 100 folks bombarded him with
e-mails this week when Drayton McLane Jr. said he would sell
baseball's Houston Astros if he isn't happy with the new labor
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Houston's a great town, but I don't think so," Cuban said about
buying out McLane. "I grew up in Pittsburgh, so I have an NL team in
the Pirates, and I have an AL team with the [Texas] Rangers. It would
be painful. I don't think there's any way I could do the Astros.</TE>
<TE>   "I've probably gotten 100 e-mails from people asking me if I'd be
willing to buy the team. One team is enough for right now. Plus, my
girlfriend would kill me."</TE>
<TE>   Horsing around: Ralph Palmer of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, decided to mix
in a little competition while visiting his daughter in California
recently.</TE>
<TE>   An avid horseshoe pitcher, Palmer found a tournament in the San
Diego area and decided to enter. He won.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, 63, said horseshoe pitching is a challenging game.</TE>
<TE>   "People have always liked a game where getting it close to
something counts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said he likes horseshoes for two reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I can do it whenever and for however long I want to," he said.
"It will consume your mind enough so the rest of the world escapes."</TE>
<TE>   Bite the bullet: Rock star Bob Seger said this year's Race to
Mackinac boat competition was scary because of severe storms that
forced at least 18 boats to drop out of the 333-mile race from
Chicago to Mackinac Island, located between Michigan's upper and
lower peninsulas.</TE>
<TE>   Seger and the crew of his 52-foot sailboat, Lightning, finished
the race, but the nearly 70-mph winds and torrential rain split one
of the boat's sails and tipped it hard to one side as the storm hit.</TE>
<TE>   "We were OK, but it was scary. I was saying, 'Do I want to do this
anymore?' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: 6 (Steve Garvey), 31 (Dave Winfield) and 35 (Randy
Jones).</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Boston's Nomar Garciaparra, after hitting three
homers in a game Tuesday, which was his birthday: "On birthdays, I'm
usually pretty low-key."</TE>

<HD>President Bush Is Right--the World Is Full of Gracie Annes</HD>
<DH>Adopting her has opened the door to another miracle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She is sitting in my lap as I write. Her legs are scissored around my
waist and she has an arm hooked around my neck. She is a little girl
in a cookie-crumb T-shirt and a fat diaper. And she is hanging on
because she needs nothing so much as to be held.</LD>
<LD>   This is a toddler who didn't know much about the bonds of love.
She spent her first 21 months in a shoestring orphanage where babies
were packed two to a crib, almost wall-to-wall. She never crawled.
She barely walked. She hadn't tasted ice cream or gone swimming.</LD>
<LD>   She's been our daughter for five weeks, and we've got the best
kind of catching up to do.</LD>
<TE>   She's not paying attention to the TV broadcast on the other side
of my office. President Bush is summoning Americans to show their
hearts. He is championing adoption. He is talking about children,
those "precious lives," who need families in a country where so many
adults simultaneously yearn for children. He is calling adoption a
"noble cause" and "a special calling," which may or may not overstate
the case. But he is also explaining that adoption is right and good
and worthy and, although common, is still under-availed, and this
says it perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely has the presidential podium been better utilized.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, George W. Bush evokes his share of criticism and cynicism in
these trying times. But there is every reason to drop our scorn and
raise our sights about so tender a thing as making a family. As he
noted, his brother, Marvin, has two adopted children.</TE>
<TE>   True, I have some regrets about what Bush left out of his remarks
on adoption, which I'll mention in a second. But the heart of his
message is that there are children who need love and adults with love
to give. And about that, there is no place for a word like "regret."</TE>
<TE>   In my experience, limited but first-hand, it's not stigma or fear
that poses the first impediment to adoption. Often, people simply do
not think of it. I didn't. Not until a weather-beaten research
scientist named Milton Love, whom I was profiling for a feature
story, remarked, "You know, there are different ways to make a
family."</TE>
<TE>   Gracie Anne, 24 pounds, one-third smile, one-third cling and
one-third appetite, is the consequence of that conversation. She is
my second daughter. My first was, as they say, a biological child.
Lacy Olivia is now 26 years old. Both girls are miracles. They are,
in turns, my answer to the age-old question: What is the meaning of
life? Gracie Anne is the answer to another: What do you do when you
believe there are too many children in the world but not enough in
your house?</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's imprimatur and the public service TV
announcements the White House unveiled, featuring his wife, Laura,
and actor Bruce Willis, will surely serve other people with the
enlightened idea that the research scientist gave to me. The new
White House-sponsored Web site, www.AdoptUS Kids.org, will give
everyone a window into the world of these children.</TE>
<TE>   "Adoption provides most of the people it touches with a beacon of
hope, a second chance, or a family. Or all of the above," writes Adam
Pertman, author of the book "Adoption Nation: How the Adoption
Revolution Is Transforming America."</TE>
<TE>   My only regrets about the president's remarks are these: I'm sorry
he overlooked the hundreds of thousands of abandoned and needy
children abroad; among them was Gracie Anne, who was born in China.</TE>
<TE>   More, I wish he had bored in on the reason that some parents end
up adopting overseas: This nation's adoption system is a mess. Too
many profit-minded lawyers. Too much deal-making. Too many
disappointments. Too many changing rules and unsettled legal
protocols about the rights of biological parents versus those of
adoptive parents.</TE>
<TE>   That's not necessarily the case with the 130,000 American foster
children now available for adoption. They were the focus of the
president's remarks, and they're deserving. Bush's next
challenge--and let's hope he's up to it--is to standardize adoption
procedures nationwide, eliminating the doubts and making way for what
he called this "extraordinary act of love."</TE>
<TE>   I know people with empty space on their laps. I can attest to the
joy of filling it up.</TE>

<HD>Barbarism Runs Rampant in the Holy Land</HD>
<DH>Atrocities are now a tactic accepted by both sides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUSSEIN IBISH</AU>
<BD>Hussein Ibish is communications director for the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest atrocity in the Middle East, in which an Israeli F-16 jet
fired a missile into a civilian neighborhood in Gaza in a successful
attempt to kill a noted Palestinian, is emblematic of the degree of
barbarism that has come to characterize this hideous conflict.
Inevitably and predictably, the attack took the lives of many
innocents, including at least nine children, two of them infants.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wasted no time in crowing that
this horror, which would certainly meet any reasonable definition of
the term "terrorism," should be counted as "one of the great
successes." No matter that the murder of Salah Shehada, one of the
top leaders of the military wing of Hamas, left in its wake so many
dead children, as well as more than 100 others wounded and at least
five houses destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   While apologists for Israel's brutalities were quick to boast
about the Israeli army's efforts to avoid civilian casualties, this
assassination by air raid indicated with stark undeniability the
utter lack of concern for those who might have gotten in the way.
Some pundits were even reduced to chiding Shehada for "making sure he
was surrounded by his wife and children and other civilians," as if a
family deserves to be killed for living in the same house.</LD>
<TE>   This wanton brutality and cynical apologies for it are, of course,
perfectly mirrored on the Palestinian side by Shehada's colleagues in
Hamas and their apologists, who have come to regard the murder of
Israeli civilians in buses, discos, cinemas and pizzerias as not only
acceptable but somehow heroic.</TE>
<TE>   The extent to which Palestinian extremists see themselves as
fighting all of Israeli society, men, women and children in everyday
activities anywhere in the country, has been well recognized in the
United States because of the appalling suicide bombings. What is less
well recognized, but no less significant and immoral, is the degree
to which the Israeli government too has adopted an attitude in which
the entire population of Palestinians is the target.</TE>
<TE>   This is demonstrated by the killings of militants' families, which
look increasingly less "accidental" as the conflict drags on.</TE>
<TE>   This attitude is also demonstrated when Israel destroys the homes
of those suspected not just in suicide bombing attacks but other
activities directed against the occupation. How else can one explain
the plan--later rejected by Israel--to expel relatives of suspected
militants?</TE>
<TE>   And finally, what other mind-set could have resulted in the
killing of more than 1,000 Palestinian civilians in less than two
years, hundreds of them children?</TE>
<TE>   Both sides grope for rationalizations and evidence of their own
"moral superiority." Many Palestinians claim that the occupation
justifies resistance by any means necessary. Many Israelis claim that
they in fact never target civilians, and those 1,000 deaths were all
the result, in effect, of tragic accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Others, including Americans, openly embrace the idea that
targeting civilians is a good idea. Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz
has advocated the destruction of an entire Palestinian village in
revenge for each suicide bombing attack, and Washington lawyer Nathan
Lewin has demanded the murder of the entire families of suspected
suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   And while the Bush administration has called for restraint on both
sides, it registers moral outrage only when Israelis are killed.
Many, if not most, of the suicide bombings have been specifically
condemned by the president or his spokespeople, which is entirely
proper. Despite the fact that Israel's use of an American-made and
-supplied F-16 in an assassination outside of its borders is a clear
violation of the Arms Export Control Act, this latest outrage is
unlikely to break the dismal pattern of moral one-sidedness.</TE>
<TE>   One has to ask what it was that the Israeli government hoped to
achieve by killing such a prominent Palestinian in such a
spectacularly ruthless matter. This question is particularly
pertinent given that it came just hours after Hamas' spiritual leader
said the organization would consider ending suicide bombing attacks
if the Israeli troops withdrew from the recently reinvaded
Palestinian cities, as President Bush and the U.N. Security Council
have demanded.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon knows perfectly well that the inevitable result of this
assassination, particularly given the extraordinary brutality with
which it was carried out, can only lead to grim vengeance from Hamas.
This in turn will provide him with further excuses to reinvade and
reoccupy Palestinian areas in the West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Pervasive moral blindness is mirrored by strategic blindness.
Sharon and Hamas kill in the name of a military victory that will
never come.</TE>
<TE>   These nominal enemies are in reality partners in the cause of
violence over negotiations and war over peace. Anyone who applauds or
excuses their massacres and terrorism, on either side, is an
accomplice.</TE>

<DH>What better place than L.A. for ethical capitalism?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TORIE OSBORN</AU>
<BD>Torie Osborn is executive director of the Liberty Hill
Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First, President Bush's Wall Street backdrop read "corporate
responsibility." Then, in Birmingham, it was "strengthening our
economy." In both venues the theme was the same: higher standards for
U.S. business.</LD>
<LD>   As the president proclaimed: "There's no capitalism without
conscience ... no wealth without character."</LD>
<LD>   What Bush seems not to realize is that the ultimate measure of
capitalism with conscience is neither ethical accounting nor faith in
business leaders. It's whether corporations treat the men and women
who work for them and the communities in which they do business
fairly, as respected and valued partners.</LD>
<TE>   If Bush's call for capitalism with conscience is to be truly
embraced, we need to talk about the elephant in the room: the yawning
gap between rich and poor. We have become the nation with the
grossest economic inequality of any industrialized nation in the
world, and addressing this will take more than anti-fraud SWAT teams
and an end to bogus bookkeeping.</TE>
<TE>   What better place to embrace these reforms than Los Angeles, the
epicenter of the nation's wealth-and-poverty divide?</TE>
<TE>   Capitalism with conscience will mean reinvesting in strategies to
equalize income and opportunity. While it's highly unfashionable to
discuss these days, that means higher taxes, not tax cuts. Even Adam
Smith, the original free-marketeer, saw the critical role of taxes
under capitalism. Writing in 1776, he said: "A goal of taxation
should be to remedy inequality of riches as much as possible by
relieving the poor and burdening the rich." Locally, business can
embrace capitalism with conscience by bringing wages up to par with
the cost of living.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica hotels that have opposed that city's
groundbreaking living-wage law could heed the president's call for a
new ethic of responsibility by ending their campaign to overturn the
ordinance that voters and the Santa Monica City Council have
endorsed. In the last five years, the living wage has proved to be
one of the nation's most successful anti-poverty measures, raising
families above the poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A.'s Koreatown, the highly profitable Assi supermarkets could
recognize the union that the men and women who work there have formed
in the hope of securing better-than-poverty wages.</TE>
<TE>   The problem of reform is not business' alone to solve. City
government can encourage more innovative job training programs like
one that received Los Angeles City Council approval last month. In
the first year of this $2-million pilot program, L.A. Metropolitan
Alliance's Healthcare Careers Program will train 250 Angelenos for
health-care industry jobs that come with a future, not French fries.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy will present its
plan for a citywide policy requiring community benefits like
living-wage jobs, job training and affordable housing set-asides as a
condition for public subsidy in private developments. City Council
adoption of the plan would mark another important step toward
achieving capitalism with conscience in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The philanthropic sector also could play a more active role than
it has in the past. At its best, philanthropy blows on the sparks of
social change. It serves as an incubator for new approaches to social
problems. But most foundations spend less than 4% of their assets in
grants each year. Nothing except precedent and timidity prevents them
from giving away more.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent speech, Lance Lindblom, head of the Nathan Cummings
Foundation, called on the nonprofit sector to "redress the imbalance
between the incentives for the focused self-interest of our economy
and economic institutions; and the self-sacrifice, altruism and
compassion of our human essence." This isn't a task for any one
sector, but can't we all move in that direction? That would represent
true wealth with character.</TE>

<HD>Simon's Mini-Disclosure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a reason wealthy business executives--think Al Checchi--have
not done well over the years at winning high office in California,
especially the governorship. Running a company or investing the
family fortune, even if the executive is fabulously successful at it,
is very different from heading a government. Bill Simon Jr., the GOP
candidate for governor, illustrated that gap Monday when he
grudgingly made his income tax returns public--sort of.</LD>
<LD>   Simon, whose job is shepherding the family money, insisted for
months that no law required him to make the returns public. He is
right about the law. But once an executive, movie star or plumber
announces for public office, he or she gives up considerable privacy.
It is standard these days for candidates to release their income tax
returns, allowing voters to judge whether the candidate paid a fair
share of taxes--Simon seems to have--and whether sources of income
could generate conflicts of interest with official duties.</LD>
<LD>   Simon has never held public office, so he has no record by which
voters can judge him. Since business success is offered as his
principal credential, voters deserve to know how he did it and how
well he did it. Simon has been reluctant to discuss his finances at
all.</LD>
<TE>   After the Internal Revenue Service revealed this month that it was
investigating whether an offshore tax shelter in which Simon invested
was illegal, the pressure intensified. However, Simon could hardly
have made the "release" less helpful.</TE>
<TE>   Aides turned over more than 1,000 pages of tax documents to
reporters, who, barred from using cameras and recorders, got to look
at them for only two hours. No help allowed from accountants or tax
lawyers, either. The reporters had to use blank pages given them by
the campaign, not their own notebooks. The whole weird ritual smacked
of a college blue book test, except it was Simon continuing to try to
cheat voters out of a full picture.</TE>
<TE>   The reporters learned that Simon paid about $8.6 million in
federal taxes on $36 million in income from family trusts,
partnerships and interest and dividends for the years 1990 to 2000.
There were pages of income reports, such as the salary Simon receives
from the family investment firm, but little information about the
ultimate sources of the money, at least not for any reporter without
expertise in accounting or investing. The returns also revealed
nothing meaningful about the family trust itself, about where its
investments might be concentrated and what fees and taxes it paid.</TE>
<TE>   Businessman-candidate Simon did not engender any trust for himself
with his tax return stunt.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This time, Los Angeles County supervisors say they really want life
to improve for the 35,000 children in the county's foster-care
system. A majority say they hope to settle a massive class- action
lawsuit rather than oppose it in court. That's a new direction for a
board that for two years had fought strenuously to avoid complying
with state requirements that social workers visit each child at least
once a month.</LD>
<LD>   The class action, filed last week, alleges that the nearly 80% of
children in county custody who have emotional or mental problems are
not getting the help they need to finish school and lead productive
lives. It charges that these failures, by the county's Department of
Children and Family Services, the Board of Supervisors and two state
agencies, violate federal Medicaid and disability statutes. The
lawsuit also says the children are being denied their right under the
14th Amendment to personal safety and reasonable treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Katie T. is one of those youngsters. With her mother living on the
street and her father in jail, the county took custody of her when
she was 4. But neglect of the child only intensified during her 10
years in county care.</LD>
<TE>   Katie has been moved 36 times. She's had 18 stays at seven
psychiatric hospitals and seven stays at MacLaren Children's Center,
the county's so-called emergency shelter, where she currently lives.
Despite psychiatric assessments when Katie was 5 and 8 years old that
identified her serious emotional and mental health needs, she never
received the necessary treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Katie, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, is one of thousands of children
deteriorating in a foster-care maze. When the problems of these
children inevitably worsen, they languish in psychiatric facilities
or are labeled delinquent.</TE>
<TE>   In Illinois, Alabama and Washington, similar suits triggered a
major overhaul of child welfare agencies. The Illinois agency was
once so poorly managed and overwhelmed that it placed many children
out of state, far from families and friends. Now, reorganized and
more ably run, the agency finds homes, health services and schooling
for almost all its wards near their families.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits aren't themselves a solution. For years L.A. County has
paid big bucks to individual children or their families who sued
because of mistreatment or, in the worst cases, death at the hands of
foster parents. Yet the future has remained bleak for children stuck
in the system.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors recently fired the beleaguered director of children's
services, Anita Bock. Attracting a successor who can expertly take on
this troubled department won't be easy. That prospect should prod the
supervisors to make comprehensive changes. Doing so will mean
negotiating a settlement of the class-action lawsuit, avoiding the
expenditure of tax dollars on a court fight and then making sure that
all children get the therapy, schooling and medical care they need.</TE>

<LD>This month a hotel business group splattered San Francisco with 33
billboards asking versions of this exasperated question: "Why are
there so many people living on our streets when we spend more money
helping them every year?"</LD>
<LD>   Tough question, and none of the pat answers are fully accurate. In
truth, neither those who would turn fire hoses on the "lazy bums" nor
those who think that jobs are all that stand between the "homeless"
and productive lives have the magic formula for ending this intricate
problem.</LD>
<LD>   But the federal Shelter Plus Care program comes as close to a
solution as this nation has found. Since Congress created it in the
late 1980s, Shelter Plus Care has provided places to live, along with
job training, medication management and other services, to 15,000
Americans suffering from chronic mental illness and other serious
disabilities.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee is scheduled to
consider whether to restore about $90 million the Bush administration
wants to cut from the $193 million that Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) and others would give specifically to Shelter Plus Care in
fiscal year 2003. If those San Francisco hoteliers are really worried
about tourism, they'll put up billboards asking why anyone would even
think of taking money away from a program that has proven so
successful in moving people off the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, Shelter Plus Care programs, including the Fox-Normandie
Apartments in Los Angeles' Koreatown, Step Up on 2nd in Santa Monica
and Hillview Village in Pacoima, give people with mental illness a
chance to, as one resident put it, "get off our butts and do
something with our lives." What's more, 70% to 80% of the people who
take advantage of Shelter Plus Care stick with it--a dazzling success
rate for a program that serves one of the nation's most help-averse
populations.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's top housing official, Mel Martinez, has
acknowledged that 150,000 more units of supportive housing will be
needed over the next decade. He must know that this new demand cannot
be met without new money.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one has figured out the incantation to--poof--make the
problem of people living on the streets disappear. But unless the
Senate restores Shelter Plus Care's money, San Francisco and other
cities can expect tourists, businesspeople and poor urban families to
step around even more people living on sidewalks in ratty tents and
cardboard boxes.</TE>

<LD>Re "Foster Children's Care Inadequate, Suit Says," July 19: I have
custody of my two grandchildren out of Orange County courts. I live
in L.A. County. I am unable to get help with child care and so far
have not been given any expense money. To date I have spent, out of
my funds, more than $800 in the month the children have been with me.
Dental alone was $400.</LD>
<LD>   The social services agency asks us to help take care of these
children to keep them out of foster care and so they can be with
family members, then refuses to even try to help us do a good job.
Why can't the different counties work together on this? Why do
children suffer because of bureaucracy?</LD>
<LD>   I love my grandchildren but must ask if foster care might not be
more beneficial to them than my love and caring. Do they have to
choose between having relatives caring for them with love or
strangers caring for them for the social services agency to be of
help?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have watched the trials and tribulations of the L.A. County
Department of Children and Family Services from outside the system
for many years and must point out that there are many skilled and
dedicated employees of the agency who have worked under chaotic and
sometimes brutal conditions to keep serving the children in their
care. They have many years' experience in child welfare and are
mature, thoughtful people who know better than anyone how badly the
system is broken.</TE>
<TE>   I have shared many glasses of wine and dinners with them, listened
to their frustration over the lack of leadership at the highest
departmental level, the lack of experience and dedication to child
welfare and their struggles to keep children safe.</TE>
<TE>   I have gone on "ride-alongs" with DCFS workers and watched them
handle situations with skill, tact and a laser-like focus on the
needs of the child in question.</TE>
<TE>   As changes take place, as they must at the DCFS, I implore the
Board of Supervisors to listen to those experienced employees--the
ones who have worked tens of years in child welfare and who have good
ideas about ways to heal the system. They know. And they care.</TE>

<LD>Re "Dozens to Compete for LAPD Leadership," July 20: After reading
the qualifications of the committee members who will make the
recommendations for the next Los Angeles police chief I conclude that
the successful candidates will have to be liberal, black, Latino or
gay, attend four churches each weekend and believe lawyers are a boon
to society. The only point of view that is missing is that of the
citizen who wants protection from criminals.</LD>
<LD>   If ever a committee was formed to produce a camel, this one has
all the ingredients. It's made up of every group that has a bone to
pick with the Police Department. Thank God there are still candidates
dedicated enough to want the job. It's processes like this that give
life to secession.</LD>

<HD>U.N. Population Fund Deserves Our Support</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The withholding of $34 million from the United Nations Population
Fund is just another in a long line of actions that distance this
country from the world community (July 21). Bowing to the political
pocketbook dictates another policy that will prove to be hurtful to
the most needy. The action was taken based upon a lie that the money
funds disapproved-of practices in China. That has proved to be false,
yet the administration refuses to release the report.</LD>
<LD>   The U.N. Population Fund itself bars funding from going to
programs involved in coercion. The withdrawal of the U.S.
contribution will result in the downsizing of the program. Our
contribution alone, it is estimated, prevents 2 million unintended
pregnancies, nearly 800,000 induced abortions, 4,700 maternal deaths,
nearly 60,000 cases of maternal illness and 77,000 infant and child
deaths. This is a senseless action against those poor families of the
world that need a fair and healthy start.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am tremendously disappointed that the U.S. is withholding its
contribution to the U.N. Population Fund because I think that
overpopulation is a major component of almost every intractable
social problem faced by the human race, and I think that preventing
human lives from being initiated is a far better solution than
allowing people to be born who have no place in this world.</TE>
<TE>   Even though I am a member of a conservative, mainstream Protestant
church that favors abstinence and adoption over abortion, I
personally have no objection to abortion or contraception because of
the following reasons: Every child born should be actively wanted,
and no woman should be forced to have a child she does not want. The
educational benefits from the fund could also conceivably reduce the
amount of HIV among heterosexual women.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Amy Wilentz pens an eloquent portrait of Israeli life under terrorist
assault (Opinion, July 21). But she errs in her belief that the
terrorism would ease if Israel ceased to occupy the West Bank. The
goal of the Palestinian Authority is to destroy the state of Israel
and eliminate Jews from the Middle East. The Palestine Liberation
Organization was founded with the avowed goal of destroying Israel
when the West Bank was occupied by Jordan. The Palestinian Authority
has changed its name, but not its goal or its tactics of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Wilentz still believes that peace is within the reach of Israeli
politicians if they would only relinquish the West Bank to
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. It is not the West
Bank that Arafat wants, but all of Israel. Arafat and his cutthroat
crew hold peace hostage, and there is nothing the Israeli government
can do to rescue it.</LD>

<TE>   As a Jew, I find Wilentz pathetic. Her article is a whine of
despair characteristic of left-wing Jews who expect life on a silver
platter and are prepared to sell out Israel in search of an illusion.
Almost without exception Israeli Jews of other political persuasions
are strong of heart and mind and will overcome any difficulty Israel
faces. Better The Times had waited for a proud Israeli, aware of his
nation's history, to put rage to paper against the Palestinian
terrorists as Americans are doing against our terrorist enemy, Al
Qaeda.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Israel's Economic Gloom," Opinion, July 21: Jo-Ann Mort has
objectively described the pain and suffering of the Israelis while
putting her finger on the root cause, the continued occupation. As
long as the current government of Israel inflicts pain and suffering
on the Palestinians and engenders hopelessness, Israelis will
continue to suffer the fallout of that policy.</TE>
<TE>   If Prime Minister Ariel Sharon cared about his people he would
find his way to the peace table to negotiate an end to the
occupation. Many of us in the Jewish American community see peace and
an end to the occupation as both just and Israel's only hope.</TE>

<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While it is very sad to read of the suffering of the Israeli
people, in the interest of fairness please consider the suffering of
the Palestinians under brutal occupation. They have curfews, children
shot in the streets, schools and hospitals closed. All this suffering
on both sides could be eliminated if Israel obeyed the U.N.
resolutions and international law and withdrew from its illegal
occupation.</TE>

<TE>   Here is a simpler road map than that suggested by "Mideast Road
Map Needed" (editorial, July 19). When the maps Palestinians and
other Arabs use actually show a state of Israel--when they have
unequivocally renounced in words and deeds the intent to destroy
Israel--peace will follow. Palestinians need not give up the dream of
a state, but they and the Arab world must discard the dream of
destroying Israel. That is what the continuing strife is about, and
everything else merely adds to the obfuscation.</TE>

<LD>John Balzar has it all backward ("Wait, It Gets Even Worse,"
Commentary, July 21). Rather than the stock market decline destroying
people's retirement plans, actually it has saved Social Security.
People who were going to retire in their 60s are now going to be
laboring well into their 70s, paying into Social Security instead of
taking out of it.</LD>
<LD>   I credit President Bush with this incredibly clever method of
solving all our difficulties. And as long as he continues to fuel our
economy with deficit-financing, we should have no problems. This is
the same method Ronald Reagan used to create our modern economy in
the first place, one in which moral business leaders save us from the
excessive regulation of a government we cannot trust. Of course, now
that those business leaders have become the government, it's hard to
know whom to trust.</LD>

hear about misguided young men who have been captured as "prisoners
of war" and are beaten and sexually abused by their captors.</LD>
<LD>   If the Taliban were holding American soldiers as prisoners of war
and beating or sexually abusing them, the world would be in an
uproar. Our government would not stand for such crimes of war and
crimes against humanity. Why is it that when our friends are
committing these horrific crimes the world does not hear about it and
our country watches in silence?</LD>

<TE>   Your story continues to trouble me. Bahram must be only one of a
number of young men being held as slaves. Is anyone working to free
these boys, provide rehabilitation and return them to their families?
Is it just a matter of raising funds for ransom, or is there
something more systemic that can be done? Someone must care enough to
do something.</TE>

<DH>Monrovia: Police, media, wildlife officials and neighbors
are on hand in 14-hour standoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 300-pound black bear who ambled down from the San Gabriel
Mountains into a Monrovia neighborhood Tuesday probably only wanted
some avocados from the trees and whatever a few trash cans might
offer.</LD>
<LD>   What he got instead was a 14-hour standoff with police and state
Department of Fish and Game officials, a nose full of pepper spray, a
tranquilizer dart in the neck, and as he wobbled and woozily
collapsed in a backyard, several nips from an irate boxer named
Butch.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday evening, Billy the Bear, as the local children have
named him, was loaded into the back of a Fish and Game pickup truck
and hauled back into the mountains.</LD>
<TE>   He was expected to wake up hours later with a headache from the
tranquilizer but otherwise unharmed, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia police were first called about midnight.</TE>
<TE>   The call was routine. It's bear season in Monrovia, and police say
they field two or three calls each night. Officers went out and fired
a few beanbags and some pepper spray, expecting the bear to high-tail
it back to the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, about 3 a.m., he climbed a towering tree at Mayflower
Avenue and Hillcrest Boulevard. He stayed there for 14 hours.</TE>
<TE>   At first, only a few police and Fish and Game officials kept
watch. But soon, children, parents, and then a gaggle of television
reporters joined the gathering.</TE>
<TE>   As the afternoon wore on and the heat beat down, Billy came down a
few times, but scooted back up when officers approached to shoo him
toward the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably scared," said Nick Carbone, 14.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he has a way down," worried his friend, James
Elliot, 14, as the bear peered from the branches, panting in the heat
and darting nervous glances at the cameras and guns trained on him.</TE>
<TE>   But minutes later, about 5 p.m., Billy did descend. He slithered
down the tree as gracefully as a 4-pound kitten, dropped to the
ground and peered warily at the crowd. He carefully picked his way
among shrubs and started to make a run for it across the driveway,
apparently toward the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   And then: Boom!</TE>
<TE>   Officers fired a beanbag intended to spur him on. It had the
opposite effect, and Billy was up the tree faster than most of the
television cameras could follow his movements.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hoping he wouldn't go up," said Monrovia Police Capt.
Terry Dochnahl. "We're just trying to get him to run home."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, officers tried a new tack. They began firing
beanbag rounds at him in the tree.</TE>
<TE>   Children gasped, and the bear began to moan softly and scramble
from branch to branch.</TE>
<TE>   "Awww, poor thing," said Cathy Bowlin. "I feel sorry for him."</TE>
<TE>   Like most residents in the area, Bowlin has had her share of bear
sightings. But she hasn't had the problem of some of her friends,
whose trash cans were stolen almost nightly and carried into the
hills until the owners figured out how to bolt them down.</TE>
<TE>   Bears even have broken into a few houses this year, shattering
windows and heading straight for refrigerators and food cupboards,
Dochnahl said.</TE>
<TE>   "They trash the house," he said. "And one thing they always do is
leave their calling card, either on the Oriental carpet or on your
favorite bedspread."</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia seems to get more bear visits than other communities,
Dochnahl said, perhaps because of its old-growth avocado trees and
nearby watershed. Dochnahl said he was familiar with Monrovia's most
famous bear, Samson. The "hot-tub bear," who died last year at the
Orange County Zoo, gained international fame for frolicking in a
Monrovia spa.</TE>
<TE>   Like most things in Southern California, black bears aren't
natives. In 1933, 27 black bears made the trip by truck from Yosemite
to the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains, courtesy of the
Department of Fish and Game. It is estimated that 400 now roam the
Angeles National Forest. Officials said they try to avoid killing
bears. Some that have repeatedly broken into houses have been
euthanized, but others have been taken to remote locations.</TE>
<TE>   In July 2001, a bear was killed after it bit a woman near La
Verne, severely injuring her arm. In 1994, sheriff's deputies shot a
bear 14 times when it wandered into a residential community in Azusa
as children were headed to school.</TE>
<TE>   But officials told children Tuesday as they waited for Billy to
come down that the bear would not be harmed.</TE>
<TE>   About 5:30 p.m., Billy came down again.</TE>
<TE>   This time, he took off running. Police officers gave chase,
shouting at residents as they ran.</TE>
<TE>   "Folks, get back in your house right now!" yelled one officer.</TE>
<TE>   Again, Billy confounded officers. Instead of returning to the
mountains, he ducked into a construction site. Officers ran after him
through several more backyards, and, as it became apparent that Billy
intended to take this route and not the road back to the mountains,
they decided to tranquilize him.</TE>
<TE>   It took about five minutes for the sedative to take affect.</TE>
<TE>   As Kevork Panossian walked into his backyard, the bear barreled
toward him. Panossian's boxer nipped at the bear, who was too woozy
to defend itself. Then Billy passed out, and officials loaded him
onto the truck.</TE>
<TE>   Panossian said it wasn't his first encounter. Friday night, he
said, a bear walked onto his patio and grabbed a 25-pound bag of dog
food. Taking a seat outside the family room, the bear ate the whole
thing.</TE>

<HD>Wetlands Housing Project Prevails Over Environmentalists'
Appeal</HD>
<DH>Bolsa Chica: Despite opponents who vow to carry on a
32-year fight, Orange County supervisors OK plan for 388 houses near
Huntington Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest skirmish in a 32-year war, the Orange County Board of
Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously rejected a bid by
environmentalists to derail plans for nearly 400 homes on part of the
Bolsa Chica mesa near Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors, who have historically green-lighted the developer's
proposals, endorsed the Brightwater project on a 4-0 vote.
Environmentalists plan to continue challenging the developer,
Hearthside Homes, which still needs approval from state and federal
agencies before construction begins.</LD>
<LD>   "We expected the board to pave over the mesa," said Paul Arms, a
member of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, which appealed the county
Planning Commission's approval of the project.</LD>
<TE>   Brightwater would have 388 homes, an underground water reservoir
and 28 acres of open space on the 106-acre upper bench of the
two-tier mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy Dunn, executive vice president of Hearthside Homes, said, "We
were very pleased that the board agreed with the Planning
Commission."</TE>
<TE>   The California Coastal Commission is expected to consider the plan
in early 2003, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's vote is the latest twist in the long-running saga of
Bolsa Chica, an unincorporated coastal wetlands area surrounded by
Huntington Beach. Developers originally proposed a marina, a hotel
and as many as 5,700 homes in the late 1970s. That plan and several
others have been approved by county and state agencies, only to be
scaled back after environmental legal challenges.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, 4,884 homes were proposed around 1,100 acres
of preserved wetlands. By 1996, the project had shrunk to 3,300
homes. A year later, the state paid $25 million for 880 acres. That
parcel was added to 300 acres that landowner Signal Landmark had
given to the state for wetlands preservation in 1973. The resulting
Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve is the largest wetlands in Southern
California. A separate project to restore tidal flushing to the
wetlands is underway with $100 million from the state and the ports
of Long Beach and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the struggle is over the remaining 230-acre mesa that
overlooks the wetlands. Hearthside wants to build as many as 1,235
homes on the upper and lower parts of the mesa. The fate of the lower
mesa is tied up in the courts. The county Planning Commission
approved the Brightwater plan in May.</TE>
<TE>   The Land Trust appealed, arguing that Hearthside is trying to
piecemeal a larger project on the entire mesa and that the
development would destroy an archeologically significant
8,000-year-old Native American coastal village. The trust also argued
that environmental documents were outdated, planned buffers to
protect sensitive habitat are too small and compensation for the
impact on the environment and traffic is improperly left to the
future.</TE>
<TE>   "Enough is enough," Huntington Beach resident Joseph Jeffrey said.
"This project has been studied, revised, compromised and modified
more than any other project in Orange County. It's time to move on."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson said the downsizing of the project helped
make it acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists vowed to continue fighting the project.</TE>

courtroom to two misdemeanor counts of petty theft.</LD>
<LD>   Hugo Rojas, 33, who heads the Hawthorne Youth Commission and was

acting on the advice of his attorney in entering the plea.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm pretty disappointed, but I trust his judgment," Rojas said.
"I've been disrespected since the beginning of this, and basically
I'm tired of coming" to court.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appeals court Tuesday denied actor Robert Blake's request
that a bail hearing be ordered and his murder charge reduced.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, 68, has been held without bail in Men's Central Jail in
downtown Los Angeles since his April 18 arrest in the murder of his
wife, Bonny Lee Bakley. She was fatally shot in Blake's car near a
Studio City restaurant in May 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys Paul L. Hoffman and Harland W. Braun had asked
the 2nd District Court of Appeal to order the trial judge to conduct
a bail hearing for Blake.</LD>
<TE>   The actor, who starred in the 1970s television series "Baretta,"
has pleaded not guilty to murder, two counts of soliciting murder and
conspiracy with the special-circumstance allegation of lying in wait.</TE>

<HD>Consumers Are the Key in Budget</HD>
<DH>Finances: Sales tax revenue is crucial in lean times. But
officials fear a nervous public will cut back on spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Already severely battered by the stock market, state coffers could
suffer even bigger losses because of the recent bust on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Though the stock market morass may hurt the state's balance sheet
by diminishing taxable personal income, possibly more dangerous at
this point are the revenues that could evaporate if nervous consumers
quit spending.</LD>
<LD>   A decline in revenues generated from capital gains and stock
options is not expected to deliver the same direct hit on the
California budget as the burst of the Silicon Valley technology
bubble and coinciding dip in the stock market that contributed to the
current $23.6-billion budget gap.</LD>
<TE>   The reason: Stock-option and capital-gain revenues had already
fallen so dramatically that state officials were counting on less of
them than in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   Revenues from stock options and capital gains climbed to $17
billion in the 2000 budget year before plunging to about $6 billion
last year.</TE>
<TE>   The current budget, which remains mired in the Assembly, relies on
about $7 billion from the two sources.</TE>
<TE>   Unclear, however, is what role shaken consumers could have on the
budget. The state is counting on the sales tax to generate $21
billion. That's a sizable amount that could be eroded if shoppers,
particularly wealthy ones, rein in their spending. Sales and use tax
receipts for June came in $122 million below the forecast.</TE>
<TE>   If that trend continues, the double threat of a devastated stock
market and weak sales could cause the $9.8-billion shortfall forecast
for 2003-04 to mushroom.</TE>
<TE>   The state's total revenue for May and June came in about $650
million below forecasts. Lawmakers have set aside nearly $1 billion
in reserve, which Gov. Gray Davis is widely expected to increase when
the spending package hits his desk.</TE>
<TE>   For now, neither the Department of Finance, the state agency that
crafts the governor's version of the budget, nor the state's
independent legislative analyst's office plans to revise its revenue
forecast.</TE>
<TE>   "I think at this stage it's hard to roll [Wall Street's woes] into
the revenues, but you know that it's something we need to continue to
monitor and watch in coming months," said nonpartisan Legislative
Analyst Elizabeth Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "This is kind of a point-in-time phenomenon," said Betty Yee,
chief deputy director of the Department of Finance. "We're obviously
closely monitoring it, because we've had a huge reliance on stock
market revenues."</TE>
<TE>   Finance officials pin their hopes on a pair of upbeat signs that
the economy is stabilizing: Job losses are moderating and housing
demand remains strong despite a slowdown in construction.</TE>
<TE>   A partisan standoff in the Assembly over the $99-billion budget,
which is 24 days overdue, could result in changes, including a
reduction in spending or additional taxes. Republicans, four of whom
are needed to approve the spending package and send it to Davis, are
holding back because the plan already contains nearly $4 billion in
new taxes and other new revenue to help close the budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   GOP legislators are calling for additional spending cuts to fill
the $4-billion hole, but they face strong opposition from the

<HD>Exposing Ticket Camera Flaws</HD>
<DH>Audit: State study finds red-light surveillance reduces
accidents, but that oversight of programs is lacking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The automated cameras that snap photos of motorists who run red
lights help reduce intersection accidents but oversight of such
programs is often lax, making cities that use the cameras vulnerable
to lawsuits, according to a state audit released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The audit also found that the red-light cameras--used by 20 cities
in California, including Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and Long
Beach--rarely generate hefty ticket revenues. In fact, only San Diego
and Oxnard reported making significant returns above the cost of
running the camera systems.</LD>
<LD>   The audit by California State Auditor Elaine Howle also found that
some cities--none of which were named--have used the photos to
investigate other crimes besides red-light violations.</LD>
<TE>   Howle said the auditing team's attorneys believe state law
prohibits such use of the photographs.</TE>
<TE>   "In view of these conflicting interpretations of the law, the
courts will ultimately decide whether local governments are violating
the red-light camera law when using the photographs in criminal
investigations," the audit concluded.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Libertarian Party of California criticized the
use of red-light cameras, saying law enforcement agencies that use
the photographs to investigate other crimes are abusing the program
and violating the privacy of motorists.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally foreseeable that this would happen," said David
Molony, executive director of the Libertarian Party of California.
"The price [we are paying] is we are losing privacy rights."</TE>
<TE>   But the program has some avid supporters too.</TE>
<TE>   "My 8-year-old son, Brent, was killed by a woman speeding through
a red light because she was late to work," said Toni Adams, a Brea
mother who counts herself as a fan of the red-light enforcement
program.</TE>
<TE>   "Our family will never be whole again. Those seconds saved by
running a red light can cost someone their life."</TE>
<TE>   Since being introduced to this country from Europe a decade ago,
the red-light cameras have proliferated throughout the nation, from
Alexandria, Va., to Beaverton, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The cameras, installed on poles near dangerous intersections, are
linked to sensors in the pavement and synchronized with the traffic
lights to snap photos of cars that cross a line after the light turns
red.</TE>
<TE>   Private firms hired to operate the cameras use the photos to
discern the license plates and identify the drivers. If the photo is
clear and the violation is obvious, local police are contacted and a
citation is mailed to the car owner.</TE>
<TE>   The audit, which studied seven of the 20 California cities that
use the cameras, found that only 23% of the potential violators are
cited. The most common problems: blurry photographs and vehicles
without front license plates.</TE>
<TE>   In California, red-light violations resulted in 93 deaths and
nearly 15,000 injuries in 2000, according to the California Highway
Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The audit found that accidents declined by an average of 10% in
cities that deployed red-light cameras.</TE>
<TE>   But the technology has not come without controversy. Last year, a
judge threw out nearly 300 citations in San Diego after ruling that
the city failed to closely supervise the private company hired to
install and run the cameras. The city has since suspended the camera
program.</TE>
<TE>   The audit warned that other cities must also closely monitor the
private firms that operate the cameras or risk similar rulings and
civil judgments.</TE>
<TE>   It also recommended that cities regularly inspect the cameras and
monitor the companies handling the photographs.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Affiliated Computer Services, the nation's
largest provider of red-light cameras, promised to work with local
cities to implement the audit recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome any recommendations that minimize legal challenges and
further citizen and driver confidence and support," said spokeswoman
Janis Langley.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Police Chief David Bejarano said he agrees with the
audit's findings and plans to implement all the recommendations
before reactivating the city's red-light cameras in September.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the setbacks, Bejarano said the red-light cameras served a
valuable purpose in San Diego, reducing accidents 14% citywide and
30% at those intersections where the cameras were installed.</TE>
<TE>   Bejarano and other law enforcement officials said they have not
used the photographs from the red-light cameras to investigate other
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   But a Long Beach police spokesman said lawyers for the city
believe police can use the photographs to investigate crimes
committed by the motorists who run red lights.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if a driver strikes a pedestrian while running a red
light, the photograph of the car can be used to prosecute the
motorist for the accident, said Long Beach Det. David Lauro.</TE>
<TE>   In the city of Los Angeles, the red-light camera program sparked a
debate in City Hall after the vendor, Affiliated Computer Services,
delayed installation of eight cameras because of a dispute over the
citation fees. The dispute has since been settled.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Los Angeles officials said the program has yet to generate
significant revenues.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intention was always to prevent traffic accidents," said
Adena Tessler, an aide to Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski. "It was
never our intention to make money."</TE>

<CX>   Red-light cameras--An article in Wednesday's California section
incorrectly reported the effect that automated red-light cameras have
had on traffic accidents in San Diego. Since the red-light cameras
were discontinued last year, accidents have increased 14% citywide
and 30% at those intersections where the cameras were installed.</CX>

<HD>Simi Valley Man Testifies Family Tried to Kill Him</HD>
<DH>Trial: He says his wife and stepdaughter beat him with bats
after setting his mattress on fire, but attorney says the women were
defending themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Childs said he awoke suddenly to find the head of his mattress
in flames. Scared and confused, he rushed from the bedroom of his
Simi Valley home to find his family.</LD>
<LD>   He said he saw his stepdaughter, then felt a baseball bat against
the back of his head--then again, and again and again, as he held up
his arms to protect himself.</LD>
<LD>   "It was as though it was a nightmare," Childs told a Ventura
County jury Tuesday, recounting his version of an early morning
attack March 25. "I couldn't believe what was happening to me. I
didn't know what to do."</LD>
<TE>   Childs, 57, was among the first to testify Tuesday in the
attempted murder trial in which his wife and stepdaughter are
accused. Eileen Shannon Childs, 37, and her daughter, Jennifer Lee
Childs, 19, are charged with trying to burn and beat Larry Childs to
death by setting fire to his bed and then attacking him with baseball
bats.</TE>
<TE>   Because the couple's two young boys were in the house at the time
of the fire, Eileen Childs also faces child endangerment charges.
Additionally, she is accused of felony grand theft for allegedly
stealing $132,000 from her husband by forging his signature on an
insurance check.</TE>
<TE>   As Larry Childs spoke on the stand--at times having to pause to
regain his composure--the defendants sat expressionless.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend the mother-daughter duo conspired to kill
Larry Childs in an attempt to collect on a $1.4-million life
insurance policy.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted to use the money to further Jennifer Childs' career as
a pop singer, pay off debts and possibly open a Jiffy Lube franchise,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee told the jury during opening statements.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the oldest motive in the book--greed. Simple greed," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Public Defender Jean Farley, who represents Jennifer
Childs, called the prosecution's theory "preposterous."</TE>
<TE>   Farley said her client has a "lucrative" contract with a Torrance
music production company and had no desire to buy out that contract,
as alleged by the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Recording under the name Jenni Childs, the teenager has a demo CD
and a Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Farley said the two women were defending themselves against Larry
Childs, whom she described as having a "Jekyll and Hyde" personality.</TE>
<TE>   Screaming, Larry Childs grabbed the two women by the hair and
dragged them across the room after the mattress in the family's
master bedroom caught fire, Farley said.</TE>
<TE>   "They did exactly what they should have done, which is try to get
free of him," Farley said during opening statements.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Childs, tall, broad-shouldered and dressed in a white
button-down shirt and brown slacks, depicted the events leading to
the incident as a typical Sunday for the family.</TE>
<TE>   That morning, he said, he had helped his boys--Zachary, 8, and
Jacob, 11, both on Little League teams--practice their pitching and
hitting. After dinner he tucked the boys in and went to bed about
10:30 p.m., he said.</TE>
<TE>   When he awoke about 5 a.m., he testified, he saw that the
mattress--placed on the floor because of his bad back--was on fire. A
candle, bowl of grapes and hand towel found near his bed March 25
were not there when he went to sleep the night before, he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Childs said he tried to squelch the flames with a pillow,
then ran from the room, screaming, "Eileen, the house is on fire!"</TE>
<TE>   After being hit with aluminum bats by his wife and stepdaughter,
he testified, he grabbed two drinking glasses from the kitchen to
douse the flames. When the fire was out he tried to flee, but
Jennifer Childs blocked the front door and he was hit again from
behind, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he never tried to hit back. When Lee, the prosecutor,
asked why, he began to choke up and said, "They're my family."</TE>
<TE>   Testimony continues today in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Proposal Sets Aside 4,000 Acres for 'Great Park'</HD>
<DH>Land use: It would be among nation's largest. Developers
would bid on the other 15% of the base for retail space, sites for
3,400 homes. The Irvine Co. is bowing out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of negotiations, Irvine and the federal government
unveiled a plan Tuesday that calls for developers to create one of
the country's largest urban parks at the mothballed El Toro Marine
base in exchange for the right to build there.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would set aside 4,000 acres--about 85% of the available
land at the base--for sports fields, museums, wildlife corridors and
other public uses, in keeping with the city's vision for a "Great
Park."</LD>
<LD>   The Navy announced that it would sell the base to the highest
bidder after Orange County voters in March rejected a proposed
airport at the site. That prompted critics to warn that tens of
thousands of homes would be built and that the promised park would
vanish.</LD>
<TE>   The land will still be auctioned off to developers, but building
will be restricted to clusters on the remaining 738 acres of the
base. Permits will be granted for 3,400 homes and 2.9 million square
feet of retail space.</TE>
<TE>   The developers will have to turn over the rest of the land to the
park as a condition of sale. They will also be required to fund the
development and maintenance of the park. Under the plan, the Navy
will pay to clean up any remaining hazardous waste from military
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "We will create one of America's greatest metropolitan parks right
here in the center of Orange County," Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said.
"[It] will be developed and maintained in perpetuity with private
dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Even as pro-airport advocates continue to press their case in
lawsuits, Navy officials said their decision is final and that they
will move forward with the plan even if the March vote is overturned
in court.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed park would be four times the size of San Francisco's
Golden Gate Park. Irvine officials said it would be developed over 10
years, but parts could be open to the public by mid-2005.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a dream come true," said Michael Pinto, president of the
Laguna Canyon Foundation. He and other conservationists said they
were delighted by the setting aside of 1,200 acres to complete a "sea
to sage" wildlife corridor stretching from Crystal Cove State Park to
Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Development industry analysts say bidders will likely line up for
an opportunity to own some of the El Toro land, even if it means they
have to put most of the acreage they buy--and millions of additional
dollars--into the park.</TE>
<TE>   "Availability of land in central Orange County is at a premium,"
said Richard Gollis, principal of the Concord Group, a Newport Beach
real estate consultancy for builders of master-planned communities.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers would also have development rights already in place,
fast-tracking the approval process and allowing construction to start
right away, thus saving them millions of dollars on land-use studies
and potential lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   As much as half the residential development would be mixed among
shops and offices in a proposed transit village, which would include
a new Metrolink station near the Irvine Spectrum. Nearby would be a
39-acre expansion of the Irvine Auto Center and 117 acres zoned for
research and development facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Gollis said companies nationwide have expressed interest in the
base and he expects a lively bidding war after Irvine completes the
process of annexing the land from the county about a year from now.</TE>
<TE>   One developer that is not interested--to the surprise of many--is
The Irvine Co. The land is adjacent to its Irvine Spectrum complex,
as well as its proposed 12,000-home Northern Sphere Project. Analysts
had predicted that the company would buy any El Toro land that came
on the market, if only to keep competition away.</TE>
<TE>   Affordable-housing advocates, who hoped more units would be set
aside for low-income workers, expressed some disappointment with the
plan. The proposal requires one quarter of the homes built to be
"affordable." But under current guidelines, such homes could still
cost in the high $200,000s.</TE>
<TE>   The park will also include 769 acres of meadows, a 164-acre sports
park, a 151-acre "exposition area" that could be used by cultural
institutions to build museums or libraries, 307 acres of agricultural
land, and 582 acres of public golf courses, a cemetery and veterans
memorial, and a "commercial recreation" district. The plan also calls
for setting aside 276 acres for university purposes, land where Cal
State Fullerton hopes to build a satellite campus.</TE>

<LD>A former volunteer wrestling coach at Moorpark High School has
pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old female student, a
Ventura County prosecutor said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Paul Fonseca, 23, remained in Ventura County Jail on
Tuesday, pending a sentencing hearing scheduled for Aug. 16, said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tamara Bogosian. He faces more than four years in
state prison.</LD>
<LD>   Before the start of a preliminary hearing last week, Fonseca
admitted to three felonies, including having unlawful intercourse
with a minor, penetration with a foreign object and oral copulation.</LD>
<TE>   Fonseca was an unpaid coach during the wrestling season that ended
in February.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested later that month after high school officials
notified the Ventura County Sheriff's Department of allegations that
he was sexually involved with a student.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth sex charge will be dropped at sentencing.</TE>

<LD>The owner of a Woodland Hills telemarketing company was sentenced to
five years and 10 months in federal prison Monday for fleecing stock
investors out of nearly $1.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   Employees of Assured International Inc., owned by Sam Harris, told
victims, most of them retirees, that the firm was about to go public
and that they would double their money when it did. But prosecutors
said the planned public offering was bogus. Assured held itself out
as a manufacturer and distributor of high-quality latex gloves and
condoms, a claim authorities said was also phony.</LD>
<LD>   Harris, 48, of Newbury Park, pleaded guilty in March to charges of
conspiracy and criminal contempt. The contempt charge grew out of his
violation of a 1999 injunction obtained by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, barring the sale of stock in Assured.</LD>
<TE>   After the injunction was issued, Assured continued to operate out
of rented apartments in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In May, four of Harris' associates were convicted of conspiracy,
mail fraud, wire fraud, securities fraud, contempt of court and
perjury.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Kuykendoll, 53, of Thousand Oaks; Henry Perrin, 60, of Van
Nuys; and Sharman Walker, 49, and Anthony Durant, 43, both of Canoga
Park, are scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 12.</TE>

<HD>3 Sentenced in Hate Crime; Critics Call Terms Too Light</HD>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>To the dismay of immigrant-rights activists, three teenagers from an
affluent neighborhood were given only moderate sentences Tuesday for
a hate-crime attack on five elderly Mexican laborers two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   One was given eight months in a local youth camp, one was
sentenced to the California Youth Authority for up to seven years,
and a third was sent to state prison for a 90-day evaluation.</LD>
<LD>   "We are very disappointed," said Christian Ramirez, director of
the U.S.-Mexico program of the local American Friends Service
Committee. "We feel the crimes they committed were ... against our
entire community."</LD>
<TE>   Convicted of eight felonies, the teenagers could have been
sentenced to a maximum of 12 to 15 years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   The three were among eight teens who beat, robbed and shot a group
of migrants in their 60s and 70s during a surprise attack on a
makeshift camp east of Del Mar on July 5, 2000. All have admitted
their involvement in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Hector Jimenez, head of the office's hate-crime
unit, said he was particularly disappointed that Judge James Milliken
did not give a tougher sentence to Michael Anthony Rose, 17.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Jimenez noted, all eight of the teens, from the upscale
Rancho Penasquitos neighborhood, now have two "strikes," and a third
felony conviction anytime in their lives could mean a sentence of 25
years to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Milliken sentenced Rose to the California Youth Authority, which
can detain him until he is 25. Steven James Deboer, 18, was sent to
state prison for a 90-day evaluation, after which Milliken will
decide if he deserves more time behind bars. Nicholas Paul Fileccia,
18, was sent to a local youth camp for eight months. Four other teens
received a similar range of sentences last month. The eighth teen
faces sentencing later this month.</TE>

<HD>Owner of Hollywood Hotel to Stand Trial on Charges of
Arson, Murder, Fraud</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The owner of a Hollywood hotel that was destroyed by a fire last year
in which two people were killed was ordered Tuesday to stand trial on
charges of murder, arson and insurance fraud.</LD>
<LD>   His stepfather, also accused in the blaze, was set free at the end
of the pair's preliminary hearing. Citing insufficient evidence, Los
Angeles Superior Court Judge Carlos Velarde ruled that 68-year-old
Joseph Donald Lewellen of North Hills had no financial stake in the
Palomar Hotel.</LD>
<LD>   But the judge said there is probable cause that Juan Jose Ortiz,
45, of North Hills was responsible for the Aug. 16 fire.</LD>
<TE>   Ortiz and Lewellen were not in the hotel at 5473 Santa Monica
Blvd. when it burned. Authorities believe that Ortiz's brother,
Arturo Ortiz, who lived in and managed the hotel, set the fire. He
died in the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Tenant Norma Galindo, 38, also died when she fell from a
fourth-floor window just after passing her two small children to
rescuers.</TE>
<TE>   During the 20-day preliminary hearing, prosecutors presented
evidence that Juan Ortiz stood to gain $900,000 in insurance claims.</TE>
<TE>   Arson investigators testified that eight plastic gasoline
containers were strategically placed in various unoccupied rooms.
Arturo Ortiz was wearing two layers of clothing when his body was
found. He had been caught off guard when the fire began prematurely,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jean Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   Daly said Juan Ortiz and his brother planned the fire to rid
themselves of the property, which faced $500,000 in repairs mandated
by the city Building and Safety Department.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a money pit," Daly said. "It was swallowing up money,
and money had to be put in it."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz's attorney, Charles L. Lindner, said his client had no
reason to torch the hotel, because it was profitable.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palomar Hotel was a moneymaking engine that just needed a few
repairs," Lindner said.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz is being held without bail pending his arraignment on Aug.
6.</TE>

<HD>Leo McKern, 82; Character Actor Brought Rumpole to Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leo McKern, a distinguished character actor who was indelibly
identified with the short, round and irascible English barrister of
television's "Rumpole of the Bailey" series, died Tuesday in Bath,
England, after a long illness. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   McKern starred in the series based on the Rumpole stories of
writer and former barrister John Mortimer. Created for British
television and imported to the United States in 1980 as part of PBS'
"Mystery!" series, it ran on and off for seven seasons, ending in
1995.</LD>
<LD>   Critics agreed that the fleshy-faced actor with the supple
baritone so fully inhabited the role of defense lawyer Horace
Rumpole--a more colorful, curmudgeonly and British version of Perry
Mason--that it was impossible to conceive of any other actor fitting
the part.</LD>
<TE>   "Leo comes from Sydney, and Australians are born with one great
advantage: They have almost no respect for authority," Mortimer once
said. "Rumpole's disdain for pomposity, self-regard and the soulless
application of the letter of the law without regard for human values
came naturally to him."</TE>
<TE>   McKern left school at 15 to help support his family during the
Depression. The youngest of three sons, he was hired as an apprentice
engineer in a refrigerator factory where his father and brothers also
worked.</TE>
<TE>   He had not worked there long when he was struck in the eye by a
piece of steel. Doctors operating with red-hot needles botched the
surgery to repair his retina. He recalled that the operation was not
painful, "but you hear the hiss and smell your eye cooking."</TE>
<TE>   He lost the eye and replaced it with one of glass. He was fond of
tapping it with a pencil during rehearsals to unnerve his fellow
actors, or burying it in a mound of spaghetti and then complaining
loudly to the waitress for befouling his food with such an
unappetizing object.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter Abigail, who also played a barrister in "Rumpole,"
once described him as "a spoilt 5-year-old" with "incredible
presence."</TE>
<TE>   He studied at a commercial art college before being drafted into
the Australian army in 1940. While in the service, he requested a
10-day leave to marry a woman he had met at the art school, but
failed to return for 20 days. Faced with severe punishment, he
concocted a story that his bride had run off with an American
serviceman. He managed to squeeze out some tears while telling his
tale of woe to the commanding officer.</TE>
<TE>   The officer found his story so convincing that he gave McKern a
small fine instead of locking him up.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I decided then that I'd become a full-time actor," McKern
told London's Daily Telegraph newspaper in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   His wife eventually did desert him for another man--McKern's best
friend, whom he described as "a much nicer bloke than me." After the
marriage ended, he met a Sydney stage actress, Jane Holland, and
married her in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, he made his London stage debut as Forester in
Shakespeare's "Love's Labour's Lost" with London's historic Old Vic
Company. Soon after, he was playing Guildenstern to Michael
Redgrave's Hamlet, also at the Old Vic.</TE>
<TE>   He worked steadily in London theater through the next two decades,
while also amassing a solid string of film credits in roles ranging
from Thomas Cromwell in "A Man for All Seasons" to a cult leader in
the Beatles' "Help."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it was television that brought him the widest acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   McKern started his television career in 1967 with a role as the
repressive "No. 2" in "The Prisoner," the British drama starring
Patrick McGoohan that became a cult classic.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he was featured in the series "Reilly--Ace of Spies" and
several television movies.</TE>
<TE>   "Rumpole" evolved a few years after he finished the 1970 movie
"Ryan's Daughter." He had come across a Rumpole story and was
impressed by the vivid characters and the quality of Mortimer's
writing.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't you write a short series, say six?" he asked Mortimer.</TE>
<TE>   Mortimer wrote the scripts, London's Thames Television bought the
rights, and the show debuted in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "Rumpole of the Bailey" offered a raucous view of the British
legal system, from the petty bickering within Rumpole's law office to
the incompetent "darlings" on the bench at Old Bailey, the central
criminal courthouse in London.</TE>
<TE>   The main character was a rumpled, exasperating, acerbic specialist
in bloodstains and murder, who was always jowl-deep in a
controversial defense of a pornographer, say, or a devil worshiper.
His motto: "Never plead guilty."</TE>
<TE>   He spouted poetry at the wrong moments, and relished quaffing the
cheapest burgundy available--usually "Chateau Fleet Street" or
"Chateau Thames Embankment."</TE>
<TE>   He was always in conflict, particularly with his indomitable wife,
Hilda--"She Who Must Be Obeyed." Yet McKern made him an endearing
crank, as "lovable as a grumpy old panda," a Wall Street Journal
critic said.</TE>
<TE>   After the series ended, the classically trained actor returned to
the stage. In 1999, he was preparing for a Sydney Opera House
performance of the 18th century comedy of manners "She Stoops to
Conquer," when he remarked on how difficult it was to leave Rumpole
behind.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how many years it is since I did the last Rumpole,
but that's all people talk about or remember," he complained.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Mortimer paid tribute to McKern, calling him "a
wonderful actor who not only played the character but added to it,
brightening it and bringing it fully to life."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife and two daughters.</TE>

<HD>Don't Split 9th Circuit, House Panel Is Told</HD>
<DH>Appeals: Chief judge opposes a bill to divide the
nine-state court, long a target of conservatives. But 'we are too big
now,' a colleague says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the nation's largest, should
not be broken in two, the court's chief judge told a House Judiciary
subcommittee Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at a hearing called in the wake of the court's
controversial decision declaring the Pledge of Allegiance
unconstitutional when recited in public schools, Judge Mary M.
Schroeder, said, "It is wrong to realign circuits or not realign them
and to restructure courts or to leave them alone because of
particular judicial decisions or particular judges."</LD>
<LD>   Instead, she said, legislators should allocate money for
additional judgeships on the court, which covers nine Western states.
No new judges have been added to the 28-judge court since 1984,
although the caseload has doubled, she said.</LD>
<TE>   Conservative congressmen view the existing court as a hotbed of
liberal activism and have called for changing its makeup. In April,
Rep. Michael Simpson (R-Idaho) introduced legislation that would
redraw the 9th Circuit to include only California, Nevada and
Arizona. The bill would create a new 12th Circuit, comprising Alaska,
Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and the U.S. territories
of Guam and the Mariana Islands.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was heard in committee for the first time Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "One could take these unique circumstances of the calling of the
hearing and conclude it is an attempt to punish the 9th Circuit for
its decision on the Pledge of Allegiance," said Rep. Howard L. Berman
(D-Mission Hills).</TE>
<TE>   Berman said he has reviewed the issue and has concluded that the
court should remain whole.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing Tuesday of the subcommittee on courts, the Internet
and intellectual property, some members of the Judiciary Committee,
as well as another 9th Circuit judge, questioned the court's ability
to manage its huge caseload.</TE>
<TE>   "The only consideration should be optimal size for a judge to do
his job," said 9th Circuit Judge Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain. "We are too
big now."</TE>
<TE>   The court has twice as many pending cases as the second-busiest
5th Circuit, which comprises three states. The 9th Circuit takes an
average of 15.8 months to hear a case once an appeal is filed, versus
an average of 10.9 months for all courts of appeal, according to
federal data. This is evidence that the court has grown too
cumbersome and needs to be divided, some members of the legal
community said.</TE>
<TE>   "Justice delayed is justice denied," Idaho Atty. Gen. Alan G.
Lance testified at the hearing. "We in the West are not getting it."</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that the 9th Circuit's decisions are often
overturned. From 1990 to 1996, the Supreme Court struck down 73% of
the circuit's rulings it reviewed. In 1997, the high court reversed
27 of 28 rulings by the circuit. Since 1997, the Supreme Court has
overturned 26 rulings by the 9th Circuit in unanimous opinions.</TE>
<TE>   In its decision last month, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit
said reciting the pledge in public schools violated the
separation-of-church-and-state clause of the Constitution because of
the words "under God." The ruling is on hold pending an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   By dividing the court in two, Lance said, the new courts could
have "commonalities of interest." The three states in the Colorado
River basin are most likely to hear death-penalty appeals, he said,
while the northwestern states connected with the Columbia River basin
share similar Native American and environmental concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long way from Honolulu to Seattle, no matter what circuit
you are in," responded Schroeder, the 9th Circuit's chief judge. "You
can't legislate geography."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have contended in the past that the only way to divide
up the court's caseload equally would be to place a portion of
California in the new circuit, which could ultimately result in
conflicting interpretations of federal law in the same state.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative legislators have vowed to continue the fight--now
three decades old--to break up the court.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced a similar bill July 15.
He has also vowed to place an amendment to split the 9th Circuit in
"most every bill" until the full Senate votes on the issue.</TE>

<HD>Dave Carter, 49; Folk Music Writer Toured With Joan Baez</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Carter, 49, a respected songwriter in the folk music scene, died
of an apparent heart attack July 19 in Hadley, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Carter had just returned from a run when he was stricken and died
a short time later. He was scheduled to perform Saturday with his
longtime musical partner Tracy Grammer at the Green River Festival in
Greenfield, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Oxnard, Carter was raised in Texas and Oklahoma. His
mother was a fundamentalist evangelist and his father a
mathematician. Carter studied piano, guitar and cello and began
writing music at an early age.</LD>
<TE>   He earned a master's degree in music from the University of
Oklahoma, and worked as a computer programmer and studied Jungian
psychology before turning full time to music in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Carter formed a duo with Grammer, a fiddler, in 1998 and released
their first album, "When I Go," the same year.</TE>
<TE>   They signed with the Signature Sounds label and released three
CDs, "Tanglewood Tree," "Drum Hat Buddha" and "When I Go."</TE>
<TE>   Carter and Grammer toured with singer Joan Baez earlier this year.
In a recent interview with the Boston Globe, Baez praised Carter's
songs, saying, "Dave is masterful with words, and there's a real
spiritual connection in there."</TE>

<HD>Raymond F. Taft, 83; Competitive Masters Swimming Champion</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raymond F. Taft, 83, a champion in masters swimming, died Friday at
Kaiser Hospital in Redwood City of complications from a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1970s, Taft helped found the masters swimming format,
which offers competitive swimming to people 19 and older.</LD>
<LD>   He held world and national swimming records, and won several
national and international championships.</LD>
<TE>   A native of San Francisco, Taft began swimming in junior high
school. In 1940, he had the world's fastest time in the 100-meter
backstroke, but World War II prevented him from competing in the
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the Army during the war, he returned to the Bay
Area and, with the help of his wife, opened a swim school.</TE>
<TE>   Taft, who underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 1990, was inducted
into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1996 for his
individual accomplishments and his efforts on behalf of masters
swimming.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Taft was ranked in the top 10 nationally for his age
group in 11 events, including top rankings in four events.</TE>

<HD>Simon Shows Poor Form by Offering a Fleeting Glimpse of
Tax Returns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Step up, step up, California! I gotcher top-secret Bill Simon tax
returns right here, every last page! It's a miracle of the campaign,
a spin-defying stunt, and there's only one place you can lay your
peepers on these papers--right here!</LD>
<LD>   How did I accomplish this feat, you may ask? How did I outwit the
Simon campaign, which gave reporters only a few hours to digest a
thousand pages that would leave Alan Greenspan puzzling?</LD>
<LD>   How did I put one over on my own colleagues, who had to turn
clockwise three times, say "Mother, may I?" and give the secret
cub-reporter handshake, just to be allowed in the door to take a
gander?</LD>
<TE>   High-tech and chutzpah, my friends, high-tech and chutzpah. As I
flipped through the pages, I switched on a high-speed spy video
camera hidden in the pink azaleas on my hat ... and then, borrowing a
page from that American heroine Fawn Hall, who smuggled out
classified documents for her Iran-Contra boss Oliver North, I too
simply dropped the video into my high boots and strolled out.</TE>
<TE>   And what did I find? Shockers, ladies and gentlemen. You may want
to cover the kiddies' ears. Trusts that make the CIA look as
forthright as a church picnic. Shelters to make the Caymans blush.
There's more, plenty more, and for the small price of admission, my
friends, you too can gaze upon these fiscal freaks. Who will be
first? Thank you, sir, go right on in. Don't be shy, folks, come
right on up--this way to the egress.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I didn't really see the thousand-plus pages that the Simon
campaign laid out for the press. I wasn't there in the Santa Barbara
Room of the Hyatt Hotel in Sacramento on Monday. And if I had been,
even campaign drones might have noticed something suspicious about a
woman wearing boots in July.</TE>
<TE>   So I don't know what was in those pages. The point is, even people
who saw them don't know what was in them, either.</TE>
<TE>   It was an exercise in the ridiculous, and in a kind of inverted
political genius. For months Bill Simon has been campaigning as man
whose business acumen can redeem California.</TE>
<TE>   But when it came to particulars--such as the tax returns that
virtually every candidate up to and including George W. Bush
customarily makes public--Simon's message was that they're private,
and voters should simply take it on faith that when it comes to
business, a rich guy knows what's what.</TE>
<TE>   Gray Davis' campaign was trumpeting every squirming minute of
these months, and it got under Simon's skin. At one point he compared
Davis to some hybrid of Karl Marx and Big Brother for harping on
whether Simon paid his "fair share."</TE>
<TE>   But of late, with some of the nation's top CEOs rampaging through
their firms like serial killers, Simon's tangled lines of defense
weren't going to work much longer, even after he rather desperately
promised to disclose his returns if he were elected--the tax version
of Richard Nixon's promise to reveal a "secret plan" to end the
Vietnam War only if Americans elected him president.</TE>
<TE>   At last--and here's where the devilish campaign genius comes
in--the exasperated Simon campaign said, fine.</TE>
<TE>   You want his tax returns?</TE>
<TE>   OK, pal, here they are, whomp, whomp, two huge volumes, more than
a thousand pages in all, a decade's worth of returns.</TE>
<TE>   You've got until 9 p.m. No cameras, no recorders, no photocopying,
and no ringers--meaning no professional tax experts who might
actually understand what they're looking at.</TE>
<TE>   So start writing, suckers.</TE>
<TE>   On short notice, a few political reporters get a few hours to sort
through a decade's worth of immensely complex taxes and figure out
what's going on--a single hit-and-run chance to see tax documents
that Simon surely had a squadron of accountants working for weeks to
prepare.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't showing tax returns, it was flashing them.</TE>
<TE>   Now the campaign can say with bland truth: Oh yes, we released our
tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   (This may not put an end to it, if it's the Internal Revenue
Service and not mere reporters insisting on answers. The IRS recently
filed court papers that name Simon and others as beneficiaries of a
tax shelter that the government says could be illegal. Simon was not
accused of wrongdoing, and describes the matter as a dispute between
the IRS and the accounting firm of KPMG. The IRS has demanded
documents from KPMG and another accounting firm for an investigation
of what federal officials call abusive tax shelters. The IRS matter
upped the pressure on Simon to show his hand.)</TE>
<TE>   The campaign is counting on the likelihood that, come November, no
one but the press and the late-night comedy writers will remember the
preposterous conditions, like the fact that the Simon campaign only
wanted reporters to use special Simon-supplied paper to take notes
on. (Was it infused with disappearing ink?)</TE>
<TE>   It's politics, without a doubt, perhaps politics at its
manipulative best. But as is so often the case, it's also a long way
from democracy.</TE>

<HD>William L. Pierce, 68; Ex-Rocket Scientist Became White
Supremacist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>William L. Pierce, a rocket scientist turned neo-Nazi writer who used
a mix of intellect and hate to rise to the top of the American white
supremacist movement and become the "godfather" of skinheads, died
Tuesday in his West Virginia compound.</LD>
<LD>   He was 68. The cause of death was renal failure, a spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce, who freeze-dried rabbits and stockpiled guns in
preparation for Armageddon, wrote the novel "The Turner Diaries," a
hate-filled book thought to have inspired Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy J. McVeigh.</LD>
<TE>   From his fenced-off compound in Hillsboro, W. Va., the tall,
avuncular Pierce commanded an army of 1,500 skinhead followers, under
the banner of the National Alliance, with dozens of chapters across
the country and around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce called for the establishment of all-white "homelands" and
the expulsion of blacks and Jews, and disseminated ideas through the
Internet, books and rallies. The most recent National Alliance event
was 10 days ago, a march in Gainesville, Ga., organized to intimidate
the town's large--and growing--Latino population.</TE>
<TE>   Watchdog groups consider the National Alliance the most dangerous
white supremacist organization, partly because Pierce helped spread
its message to educated and professional people.</TE>
<TE>   "William Pierce created a very regimented, sophisticated network,"
said Deborah Lauter, Southeast regional director for the
Anti-Defamation League. "He was the godfather of hate in this
country. I imagine his death will be a blow to the movement."</TE>
<TE>   Pierce is credited with extending the reach of the skinhead
movement to angry teens by buying a white-power recording studio,
Resistance Records, which churns out lyrics like: "Did 6 million Jews
really die or was it just a Zionist lie...." He also designed a video
game called Ethnic Cleansing.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters say that he was misunderstood and that despite his
image as a violent separatist, he was in fact a gentle man who liked
walking through the woods with his Persian cat, Hadley, on his
shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, Dr. Pierce is one of those great men who will be
better appreciated after he's gone," said Chester J. Doles, a
National Alliance leader in Georgia. "I mean, some of his teachings
were just too advanced for his time."</TE>
<TE>   William Luther Pierce was born in 1933 in Atlanta, the son of an
insurance agent and journalist. He went to Rice University as an
undergraduate, received his doctorate from the University of Colorado
and then taught physics at Oregon State University. He also worked on
jet propulsion at a Pratt &amp; Whitney laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1970s, Pierce had left the scientific world to join
the ranks of the growing Aryan movement. In 1974, he founded the
National Alliance in Arlington, Va. Ten years later, he relocated to
the hills of West Virginia, where authorities monitored him but
mostly left him alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The Turner Diaries" is his best-known work, a fictional story
published in 1978 about a group of neo-Nazis who violently overthrow
the government.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors called the novel "a blueprint" for the
Oklahoma City bombing, with McVeigh using the same
explosive--ammonium nitrate fertilizer--as Pierce's character in the
book and setting off his device about the same time, 9 a.m. McVeigh
was a known acolyte of Pierce's, and a passage from "The Turner
Diaries" was found in McVeigh's car after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike white supremacist leaders imprisoned for their connections
to violent acts, Pierce was never convicted of a serious crime.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, he was diagnosed with widespread cancer, said
Billy Roper, a National Alliance official.</TE>
<TE>   But he chose to continue living in his compound and died of kidney
failure in his room on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce is survived by two sons and a brother.</TE>
<TE>   National Alliance officials would not discuss who will succeed
him.</TE>

<HD>San Francisco May Join Battle Over Pot by Growing Its Own</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated by federal efforts to stymie the medicinal use of
marijuana, San Francisco is considering a novel and potentially
provocative new twist--growing its own pot.</LD>
<LD>   A measure is headed onto the November ballot asking San Francisco
voters whether the municipal government should explore cultivating
and distributing cannabis to the seriously ill.</LD>
<LD>   By giving marijuana use for medical reasons the city's blessing,
the Board of Supervisors hopes to ease legal pressure on patients and
undercut continuing efforts by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration to shut down clubs that distribute the drug.</LD>
<TE>   But a move into pot farming by the city would almost certainly
intensify the court fight over conflicting state and federal laws.
Though use of marijuana is legal in California and seven other states
if approved by a doctor, pot remains a banned drug in any
circumstances under federal law.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, this does challenge federal law and the DEA," said Mark
Leno, the San Francisco supervisor who pushed the measure onto the
ballot during a board meeting Monday. "It has to be done. No one
should have to go on the street to find this medicine."</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure is advisory, and would allow officials to
examine the pitfalls and possibly pull back if obstacles to starting
a pot distribution system seem too great.</TE>
<TE>   If the city presses ahead, the federal government would almost
certainly challenge it in court.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's unfortunate the supervisors are putting this on the
ballot," said Richard Meyer, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
spokesman in San Francisco. "I just can't see the city being in the
business of growing pot."</TE>
<TE>   Some backers of medical use of marijuana say the city's endeavor
might simply be written off as an end-run by a region regarded by the
Bush administration as eccentric.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of the country looks at us as the land of fruits and
nuts," said William Panzer, an Oakland attorney who has defended
several patients prosecuted for using pot. "But the more that
politicians are willing to stand up and say, 'Let's stop this
insanity,' it's helpful."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis and state lawmakers have balked at stepping into
the pot distribution business for patients.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has also remained opposed to a push for identification cards
for patients who use marijuana for medical reasons.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco, meanwhile, has unabashedly embraced the medical
marijuana movement. Last year, the city declared itself a sanctuary
for patients who use the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past two years, it has issued about 3,700 identification
cards for marijuana-using patients through the health department.</TE>
<TE>   The debate has been particularly intense in San Francisco because
of the large number of AIDS and HIV patients in the city. Leno and
other supporters of medical use of marijuana say the drug helps in
easing the effects of AIDS-related wasting, the nausea of
chemotherapy, as well as the discomfort of glaucoma and multiple
sclerosis.</TE>

<HD>Chaim Potok, 73; Chronicler of Jewish Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chaim Potok, an ordained rabbi and best-selling novelist whose
fiction often probed the dueling personal and spiritual demands of
the Jewish faith versus the values of secular American society, died
Tuesday at his home in suburban Philadelphia. He was 73 and had been
diagnosed with cancer in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   While steeped in the spiritual traditions of his Orthodox Jewish
upbringing, Potok drew liberally on the literary traditions and
worldviews of many other cultures. In fact, it was his youthful
encounter with two novels deeply rooted in issues of Catholicism,
Evelyn Waugh's "Brideshead Revisited" and James Joyce's "Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man," that inspired him to write fiction
himself.</LD>
<LD>   Potok succinctly stated his view of literature's mind-expanding
value in a 1997 interview with the Mars Hill Review. "Literature
presents you with alternative mappings of the human experience," he
said. "You see that the experiences of other people and other
cultures are as rich, coherent and troubled as your own experiences.
They are as beset with suffering as yours. Literature is a kind of
legitimate voyeurism through the keyhole of language, where you
really come to know other people's lives--their anguish, their loves,
their passions."</LD>
<TE>   It was this ability to empathize with and project himself into
other cultures and historical circumstances, along with his
formidable storytelling gifts, that helped Potok attract large
international audiences of many faiths. From his breakthrough and
best-known novel "The Chosen" (1967) through eight more novels, short
stories, plays and children's fiction, Potok synthesized his broad
learning and experience into works that bore a profoundly humanist
stamp.</TE>
<TE>   And although that secular quality upset some Jewish readers and
scandalized some members of the Jewish press, many other readers and
critics applauded Potok's fearlessness and skill in exploring the
internal fissures in modern Jewish life and belief.</TE>
<TE>   For many non-Jewish readers, his work provided a vivid
introduction to Jewish life in the post-World War II period, to its
daily joys and familial rites that could be alternately enriching and
smothering.</TE>
<TE>   Those conflicts provide the central motif in "The Chosen," whose
hero, Danny Saunders, discovers a rich, complex world beyond the
confines of his Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in 1940s Brooklyn.
Nominated for a National Book Award, the work was made into an
acclaimed 1981 film starring Rod Steiger, Maximilian Schell and Robby
Benson. A few years later the novel was adapted into a Broadway
musical starring George Hearn and Gerald Hiken, with book by Potok,
music by Philip Springer and lyrics by Mitchell Bernard. A play based
on "The Chosen" will have its West Coast premiere Sept. 12-Oct. 13 at
the Miles Memorial Playhouse in Santa Monica, in a production of the
Los Angeles Repertory Company and the West Coast Jewish Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Born Feb. 17, 1929, in the Bronx, N.Y., Herman Harold Potok was
the son of businessman Benjamin Max Potok and Mollie Friedman Potok,
immigrants from Poland. He was fond of saying that he grew up in a
Hasidic world without "the beard and the earlocks." He later changed
his first name to Chaim.</TE>
<TE>   Potok said his father had wanted him to be a professor of the
Talmud in a yeshiva. When he told his mother that he wanted to become
a writer, she said that was fine--as long as he was a brain surgeon
who wrote stories on the side.</TE>
<TE>   An excellent student, Potok received his bachelor's degree summa
cum laude in English literature from Yeshiva University in 1950. He
was ordained a rabbi in 1954 at the Jewish Theological Seminary and
in 1965 earned a doctorate in philosophy from the University of
Pennsylvania. He also served as an Army chaplain on the front lines
during the Korean War, a life-altering experience that would later
find its way into his fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Personal and cultural dislocation was a recurring theme in Potok's
work. It occupied a central place in his early fiction, such as his
controversial 1972 novel "My Name Is Asher Lev," in which a Jewish
artist infuriates his community of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, when he
decides to paint Crucifixion scenes, hoping to discover a visual
syntax to express his mother's suffering. Finding no such imagery in
his own Jewish faith, with its historic ban on iconography as a form
of idolatry, he turns to Christian symbolism instead: the
Crucifixion, the madonna and the Annunciation.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1978 interview with Christianity Today, Potok explained that
for the book's artist protagonist, the Crucifixion has "no religious
significance" but is "an aesthetic vessel," a "form," a "motif" that
the artist "fills with his own being."</TE>
<TE>   He often compared the historical state of Jewishness with the
existential condition of the writer: simultaneously at home in the
world and yet always exiled from it, a citizen of his or her
community, but also a perpetual wanderer of the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Potok's fiction grappled with the post-Holocaust experience of the
Jewish people and the unresolvable question of why some perished
while others were spared. Many of his works suggest that survival is
both a blessing and a curse, and that any form of salvation comes
with strings attached in the form of obligations. As a character in
one of his fictional works puts it, "the past is erased without
stories." Yet the past for Potok's characters was as likely to be a
burden as a balm.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1992 novel "I Am the Clay," set in Korea, he examined the
way individual lives can be transformed by massive social upheaval
from a perspective half a world removed from the Jewish American
enclaves of his youth.</TE>
<TE>   He addressed similar themes, on a very different scale, in his
books for children and young adults, such as "The Tree of Here."
Illustrated by Philadelphia Inquirer editorial cartoonist Tony Auth,
the book follows the emotional journey of a boy whose family is
moving to a new home.</TE>
<TE>   In other works aimed at young people, Potok addressed such
universal subjects as bullies and the struggle of coping with
parental divorce. Though some reviewers found his children's fiction
to be overly schematic and didactic, others praised its perceptive
evocations of young people's fears and dreams.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his writing, Potok was a painter, creating works
redolent with symbolism in an expressionistic style, and a humanities
professor at the University of Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   He also was editor for many years of the Jewish Publication
Society in Philadelphia. Among his tasks was working on a team of
editors who last year produced a 1,560-page translation and
commentary on the Torah, the first five books of the Bible. This was
the first Torah translation and commentary produced by Judaism's
Conservative movement.</TE>
<TE>   Potok also wrote nonfiction, including "Wanderings" (1978),
presented as one man's history of the Jews, and "The Book of Lights,"
which examined good and evil as seen through the kabbala, the
enigmatic form of theosophy created by mystic rabbis.</TE>
<TE>   Potok met his future wife of 44 years, psychiatric social worker
Adena Sarah Mosevitzky, at a summer camp where both were counselors.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Rena and
Naama, and a son, Akiva.</TE>

<LD>Two Buena Park police officers suffered minor injuries early Tuesday
while stopping burglary suspects who rammed their vehicle into a
patrol car, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   One officer suffered back injuries; the other sprained an ankle.</LD>
<LD>   The officers were responding to a call from the parking lot of the
JCPenney warehouse in the 6000 block of Orangethorpe Avenue about
1:30 a.m., said Buena Park Police Sgt. Rich Pena.</LD>
<TE>   He said guards spotted two men breaking into cars and called
police.</TE>
<TE>   As the men sped away, they "crashed intentionally" into one
officer's car, then reversed their vehicle and tried to flee again,
Pena said.</TE>
<TE>   But the second officer was able to stop the car by ramming it, and
the men surrendered, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The men were identified as Marcos Sanchez, 24, and Luis Humberto
Gonzales, 22, both of Los Angeles. They were booked into the city
jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon against a peace
officer and auto burglary.</TE>

<LD>The homeless population in Monterey County has increased about 45%
during the last three years, according to a survey compiled by social
workers.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives from a coalition of organizations that provide
services to the homeless identified 2,681 homeless people during a
two-day count in February. The report states that nearly one-third of
the homeless people were families, but most were single men.</LD>
<LD>   Children who left foster care because they were too old to be
adopted were found among the homeless, the report states.</LD>
<TE>   Better transitional housing is needed for those children, said
Maria Giuriato of the county's Community Action Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The high cost of living and lack of affordable housing are the
primary reasons for the growing number of homeless, officials said.</TE>

<LD>A Hanford priest accused of raping a 16-year-old girl will stand
trial Aug. 19 after rejecting a plea bargain that would have sent him
to prison for three years.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors offered Father Miguel Flores, 34, the three-year
sentence in exchange for a guilty plea to a lesser charge.</LD>
<LD>   "Father Flores' position regarding this matter has not changed,
and that is he denies the allegations against him," said his
attorney, Rick Conway of Hanford.</LD>
<TE>   Flores was being asked to plead guilty to one count of unlawful
sexual intercourse with a minor and to admit to witness intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   The priest is charged with three counts of forcible rape, three
counts of statutory rape, dissuading a witness and criminal threat
charges. If convicted of all charges, he could spend up to 27 years
in prison.</TE>

<HD>Air Terminals Evacuated After Security Breach</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A security breach prompted officials to evacuate both terminals at
Oakland International Airport for more than an hour Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   An elderly woman without a plane ticket apparently walked through
a security checkpoint exit and into a secured area without being
screened, said airport spokesman George Turner.</LD>
<LD>   When she realized that she had breached security, she returned to
the checkpoint, said Joe Wong, an operations specialist.</LD>
<TE>   The airport immediately evacuated both terminals about 6:45 p.m.
while airport personnel and Oakland police questioned the woman and
authorities inspected the area, Wong said. Authorities released the
woman after determining the breach was an accident.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers began trickling back inside about 8 p.m. to be
re-screened and it took until about 10 p.m. for air traffic to begin
returning to normal. Planes were ordered to wait on the tarmac until
authorities gave the all-clear.</TE>

<HD>Wildfire Threatens Some of Oldest Sequoias</HD>
<DH>Nature: More than 1,000 residents and campers leave as a
fast-moving blaze burns 38,000 acres in a national forest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KERNVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A rapidly expanding wildfire raged out of control in Sequoia National
Forest on Tuesday night, threatening some of the largest and oldest
trees in the world and forcing the evacuation of more than 1,000
residents and campers.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze, which had blackened more than 38,000 acres of brush and
timber and destroyed at least 10 structures by nightfall, was moving
toward the Freeman Creek Grove, a stand of towering redwoods in the
heart of the 328,000-acre Giant Sequoia National Monument. Some of
the trees in the grove are more than 1,200 years old.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the efforts of more than 1,000 firefighters on the ground
and about a dozen water-dropping tanker planes and helicopters in the
air, the wind-whipped fire continued to spread late Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "They're working the best they can, but it's extremely tough out
there," said Denise Alonzo, a U.S. Forest Service fire information
officer. "The winds are gusty, there's a lot of dry brush, and the
slopes are very steep."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Mathes, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, said the
sequoias' massive trunks can survive most forest fires, but flames
spread by underbrush to upper limbs can kill the trees.</TE>
<TE>   At nightfall, the fire was still 30 miles from the most renowned
trees in the area: Giant Forest, which is in Sequoia National Park
and home to General Sherman, said to be the largest tree in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   General Sherman is 274 feet tall, with a trunk more than 36 feet
in diameter. The tree is believed to be perhaps 2,500 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said someone started the fire Sunday
afternoon--deliberately or accidentally--in brush near Roads End, a
tiny campsite community in the rugged Kern River canyon about 20
miles north of Lake Isabella. The flames spread quickly through the
dry chaparral, driven to the treetops by strong, fluctuating winds.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze, called the McNalley Fire, advanced 12 miles to the
north and west in the first 48 hours, burning log cabins and other
buildings and forcing the evacuation of Johnsondale, a mobile home
community on South Creek, and Ponderosa, a hamlet of cottages and
cabins on Peppermint Creek.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of summer visitors, including scores of Boy Scouts, were
evacuated from camps throughout the mountainous area, crowding the
twisting, narrow roads with hastily packed vehicles..</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday night, the flames were approaching Camp Nelson, a small
resort town on the south bank of the upper Tule River.</TE>
<TE>   Skies turned reddish brown as clouds of smoke swept over Camp
Nelson, but Alonzo said the closest flames were still more than a
mile from the center of town. Fire units were redeployed to protect
the community.</TE>
<TE>   As night fell, no homes were in immediate danger, but the area is
known for its erratic, gusty winds, and fire officials warned that
the blaze could spread in any direction at any time.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters said temperatures in the national forest are expected
to top out near 90 degrees today with continuing winds and
dangerously low relative humidity. Lightning from thunderstorms could
ignite more fires tonight, the National Weather Service said.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials say the dry Southwest is facing one of the worst
fire seasons in years. About 3.7 million acres have burned in
California, Arizona and Colorado so far this year, more than twice
the 10-year average for the period of 1.7 million acres.</TE>

<HD>Garciaparra Has a Happy Birthday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nomar Garciaparra found a unique way to celebrate his 29th birthday:
with three home runs in one game.</LD>
<LD>   Garciaparra connected three times--giving him a record-tying five
home runs in two games--and had eight runs batted in to lead the
Boston Red Sox over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 22-4, Tuesday in the
opener of a day-night doubleheader at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   The Devil Rays salvaged the day by rallying for five runs in the
ninth inning and a 5-4 second-game victory. Jared Sandberg hit a
three-run homer off Ugueth Urbina (0-6) to spoil a strong outing by
Boston starter Derek Lowe.</LD>
<TE>   But it was Garciaparra's performance in the opener that
highlighted the day.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't see days like this coming," Garciaparra said after the
opener. "You never say, 'I feel good. I'm going to hit three.' "</TE>
<TE>   Garciaparra, 29, became the first major leaguer to have a three
home-run game on his birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just good timing," said Garciaparra, who was one for five
in the nightcap.</TE>
<TE>   Garciaparra homered off Tanyon Sturtze (1-10) and Brandon Backe in
a 10-run third inning, then hit a grand slam in the fourth off Backe.</TE>
<TE>   Garciaparra homered twice Sunday at New York. It was the 26th time
a player had hit five homers in two games.</TE>
<TE>   Boston, 9-1 against Tampa Bay this season, hit seven homers in the
opener.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 4, Texas 1--John Olerud hit a tiebreaking, two-run double
in the eighth inning at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   A key error by 10-time Gold Glove catcher Ivan Rodriguez helped
the AL West-leading Mariners score three times in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   With one out, Jeff Cirillo hit a high pop in foul territory in
front of the Mariner dugout.</TE>
<TE>   But the ball bounced out of Rodriguez's mitt and, given another
chance, Cirillo singled off Jay Powell (2-2).</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, Minnesota 7--Frank Thomas hit the longest homer in new
Comiskey Park history--a shot estimated at 495 feet--as the White Sox
ended Minnesota's six-game win streak.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas' two-run drive in the fourth inning cleared the left-field
bleachers. Magglio Ordonez and Aaron Rowand also homered for the
White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Buehrle (13-7) was staked to an 8-1 lead and left with the
victory after giving up 10 hits and six runs in 5 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Osuna came in to get the last out for his seventh save.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 9, New York 3--Danys Baez lost his shutout bid in the
ninth inning at Cleveland but led the Indians to a win over the
Yankees, who also lost All-Star catcher Jorge Posada to a freak
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Posada was cut on the left ear when struck by Milton Bradley's
backswing in the fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Posada, who didn't lose consciousness, was taken to a hospital for
stitches.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh inning, Bradley, this time batting left-handed,
also hit substitute catcher Chris Widger on the helmet with his bat.
Widger was not injured.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 10, Kansas City 1--Mark Redman pitched eight impressive
innings and Wendell Magee drove in four runs at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers set season highs for runs and hits. Magee, Randall
Simon, Shane Halter and Brandon Inge each had three of Detroit's 19
hits.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Ibanez singled home the Royals' run in the seventh, giving
him 17 RBIs in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto at Baltimore, ppd. rain--The game will be made up Aug. 24
as the first part of a day-night doubleheader.</TE>

<HD>Michael Andretti Purchases a Team</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: CART's leading driver becomes majority owner
of Team Green, which may move to Indy Racing League.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Driver Michael Andretti, who has more wins than any other driver in
CART history, became a car owner Tuesday when he and two partners
purchased Team Green from owner Barry Green.</LD>
<LD>   Andretti, 39, is the majority owner in a group that includes
Green's brother, Kim, and Kevin Savoree.</LD>
<LD>   The new team, which will begin operation Dec. 1, will be known as
Andretti Green Racing.</LD>
<TE>   Although Indy Racing League sources said it is expected that
Andretti will move his team to the IRL next year, he was reluctant to
make a definite statement with 10 races remaining on the CART FedEx
schedule. He will race Sunday in Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to do the Indianapolis 500, that is a race I really want,"
he said. "It is all going to come down to the sponsors. I don't have
anything solid. We hope to have an announcement in 60 days."</TE>
<TE>   Indy is an IRL race, although CART drivers, including Andretti the
last two years, have competed in it.</TE>
<TE>   Andretti holds the record for leading the most laps at the Indy
500 without winning. In 13 starts, his best finishes are a second in
1991 and a third in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   A major reason for Andretti's move to IRL would be to have Honda
as his engine manufacturer. He and Team Green now drive Honda-powered
Lolas in CART, but Honda has announced it will build engines only for
IRL teams next year.</TE>
<TE>   Andretti, with Motorola as his sponsor, is part of a three-driver
team with Paul Tracy and Dario Franchitti, both of whom are sponsored
by Kool.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at all our options," said Andretti. "Kim, J-F
[Thormann, managing director of Andretti International] and I will do
what we believe is in the best interests for Andretti Green Racing
and all of its employees."</TE>
<TE>   Mario Andretti, Michael's father and a former Indy 500 winner and
Formula 1 champion, recently announced that he planned to form a CART
team in partnership with Carl Haas and Paul Newman for the 2003
season.</TE>
<TE>   The two apparently have no connection.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Andretti leads CART drivers in wins with 42, the last one
coming in this year's Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael and I have enjoyed a close and productive relationship
dating back to our days at Kraco Racing," Green said. "When he joined
Team Green last year Michael mentioned he was interested in owning a
race team at some stage of his career, but it wasn't until last
winter that he approached me about buying the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw this as a perfect opportunity not so much to sell Team
Green, but to pass it on to my brother, Kevin and Michael."</TE>
<TE>   Green said his decision to sell had nothing to do with his recent
conflict with IRL officials at this year's 500, where it was ruled
that Tracy passed winner Helio Castroneves after a yellow caution
flag had been displayed on the next-to-last lap. Green and Tracy
contended that the pass was made before the caution.</TE>
<TE>   Team Green won the 1995 Indy 500 and the CART championship with
Jacques Villeneuve.</TE>
<TE>   If Andretti and either Tracy and/or Franchitti move to the IRL, it
will be body blow to CART, which is already struggling with a
shortage of drivers.</TE>

<HD>Zito Puts Angels in Their Place</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Left-hander shuts them down and A's win, 2-1, to
pull into virtual tie for second place with Anaheim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel Manager Mike Scioscia looked forward to Tuesday night's game
against the Oakland Athletics and the start of the second series in
less than a week between the AL West rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Five days before, Oakland left-hander Barry Zito and two relievers
had shut out Scioscia's team. But much has changed for the Angels in
the short time since.</LD>
<LD>   "This is where the schedule adds some flavor to the matchups,"
Scioscia said.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome against Zito and the A's bullpen, once again, was
anything but sweet.</TE>
<TE>   Zito and four relievers squelched several threats as the A's
defeated the Angels, 2-1, before 25,370 at Edison Field and moved
into a virtual tie with the Angels for second place in the division.</TE>
<TE>   "We had opportunities, and Zito, again much like in Oakland when
we had something started, he made some terrific pitches to get out of
some jams," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland shortstop Miguel Tejada saved at least one run with his
glove in the fifth, provided Zito and the A's with all they needed
with a two-run homer in the sixth against Kevin Appier--and opened
the door for the Angels in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels trailing, 2-1 and Oakland closer Billy Koch on the
mound, pinch-hitter Adam Kennedy hit a high pop-up to shallow left
field. Tejada settled under it, but the ball popped out of his glove
for an error.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein's sacrifice bunt advanced Kennedy to second, but
Darin Erstad lined out to left field and Koch got Tim Salmon to hit a
ground ball to first baseman John Mabry for his 25th save.</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended the Angels' three-game winning streak and left them
and the A's two games behind the Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   It also spoiled an outstanding performance by Appier, who gave up
two runs and four hits in eight innings, his longest outing of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I just pitched on the wrong night," Appier said.</TE>
<TE>   Zito, who became the first 14-game winner in the American League,
had not allowed a run in three consecutive starts. He had pitched 21
1/3 scoreless innings dating to July 7.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up five singles, struck out five and walked four in 6 1/3
innings as Oakland won for the 17th time in their last 20 games
against the Angels and improved to 7-3 this season against them.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, Zito and two relievers combined on a six-hit shutout
that gave the A's a 2-0 victory that dropped the Angels four games
behind the Mariners entering a weekend series against the AL West
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels responded by blowing out the Mariners, 15-3, in the
series opener, then posted consecutive come-from-behind victories to
sweep Seattle for the first time since 1998 and pull to within one
game of first place.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were batting .307 with runners in scoring position, but
they had only two opportunities against Zito, who has lost only once
since April 30.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' first two batters reached first base against Zito, but
neither advanced. Eckstein walked and was retired on a force play on
Erstad's ground ball to Tejada, and catcher Ramon Hernandez threw out
Ertsad trying to steal second base.</TE>
<TE>   Zito issued three more walks through the first four innings but
did not allow a hit until the fifth when Shawn Wooten and Scott
Spiezio started the inning with consecutive singles.</TE>
<TE>   Zito struck out Jose Molina and Benji Gil before hitting Eckstein
with a pitch to load the bases. It was the major-league leading 17th
time Eckstein was hit.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, however, had their hopes dashed when Erstad laced a
line drive to the hole on the left side of the infield where Tejada
made a diving catch to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada's role in the outcome was just beginning.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the sixth, Appier walked Scott Hatteberg before
Tejada stepped to the plate and bombed a 2-and-2 pitch over the
left-field fence for his 21st homer and a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The homer extended Tejada's hitting streak to 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   "When you make a great play and then you go to bat, the pitcher
better be careful because you're really happy," Tejada said. "You go
to the plate with a lot of confidence."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels threatened again in the sixth when Garret Anderson
singled with one out and Shawn Wooten singled one out later. Zito,
however, got Spiezio to pop out to second baseman Mark Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels finally broke through in the seventh after Jose Molina
led off with a single and Benji Gil hit a fly ball to deep left field
for an out.</TE>
<TE>   A's Manager Art Howe replaced Zito, who had thrown 112 pitches,
with Chad Bradford, who had not allowed a run in his last 10 outings
and had stranded each of the 15 runners he inherited over his last 17
games.</TE>
<TE>   Bradford got Eckstein to hit a ground ball to Tejada, who forced
Molina at second, but the speedy Eckstein scored when Erstad drilled
a shot down the first-base line that he legged into a triple.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon, who was six for 11 in the first three games of the
homestand, took a called third strike to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had a chance to tie the score in the eighth when Troy
Glaus and Wooten hit one-out singles against Jim Mecir.</TE>
<TE>   But Spiezio took a called third strike on a 3-and-2 pitch and
pinch-hitter Orlando Palmeiro hit a ground ball to Ellis, who threw
to Tejada at second base for a force out.</TE>

<HD>Rogers Says No, So Reds Obtain Moehler</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After several days of mulling it over, left-hander Kenny Rogers on
Tuesday blocked a deal that would have sent him to the Cincinnati
Reds for three minor leaguers.</LD>
<LD>   Rogers invoked a no-trade clause in his contract, deciding to keep
his word that he would play out his contract with the last-place
Texas Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   The Reds lobbied Rogers to approve the deal that was arranged over
the weekend. General Manager Jim Bowden spoke with the pitcher
several times by phone. Rogers decided it was more important to keep
his wife and two kids in Texas.</LD>
<TE>   The Reds then went with their backup plan, trading three minor
leaguers to Detroit for right-hander Brian Moehler.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Yankees said accusations by an admitted mobster that
their players fixed games in the 1970s were "beyond belief."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Franzese said this week on HBO's "Real Sports with Bryant
Gumbel" that players on a team he wouldn't identify in the 1970s owed
money to the Columbo crime family.</TE>
<TE>   HBO reported the team in question was the Yankees, and Franzese
said the Yankees back then "had some gambling issues."</TE>
<TE>   "The charges made by Franzese are absolutely beyond belief,"
Yankee spokesman Howard Rubenstein said. "He's a discredited former
hoodlum, and it's an outrage that any credence would be given to him
with his bad reputation as he seeks personal publicity. The Yankees
know nothing about any of these claims."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Seth Etherton was returned to the Reds after baseball
voided his waiver claim by the Yankees. Baseball voided the claim
because Etherton wasn't able to pitch. He was returned to the Reds,
who put him back on the 60-day disabled list.... An arbitrator ruled
against Graeme Lloyd, deciding the former Montreal Expo reliever must
accept his trade to Florida.... Philadelphia put pitcher Robert
Person on the 15-day disabled list because of elbow pain.... Ned
Martin, the radio and television voice of the Boston Red Sox for 31
years until his retirement in 1992, died Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>This Will Be Her Toughest Opener</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Memories will flow for Betty Mabee, whose
husband, John, died in April after years as Del Mar fixture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>For decades every July, John Mabee would put on his best clothes, go
out to the racetrack he nurtured and entertain a table full of guests
on opening day.</LD>
<LD>   "That's what's going to make it tough," Betty Mabee said. "John
not being there."</LD>
<LD>   She was talking about today's 63rd opener at Del Mar, the first
her husband will miss since the Eisenhower administration. John
Mabee, a horse owner since 1957, spent the last 32 of his 80 years in
the Del Mar boardroom, first as a member and then as president and
chairman of the track. He suffered a major stroke this spring and
died April 24.</LD>
<TE>   He was married to the former Betty Murphy for 60 years, a romance
that began during the Depression when they rode their horses to a
schoolhouse in Middle America. Betty and her son Larry, 59, are
carrying on. Betty has even moved into the boardroom at Del Mar, only
the second woman in track history to hold such a post.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope there will be more," she said. "There are a number of
women in racing who are very qualified."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Harper, the president and general manager of Del Mar, welcomed
the newest Mabee to the board several months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't imagine Del Mar without a Mabee on the board," Harper
said. "With Betty, we get a remarkable woman who has the expertise
and a warm and special style besides."</TE>
<TE>   There's a bit more to her plate than just the racetrack. On the
personal side, her husband left behind Golden Eagle Farm, a 568-acre
sprawl in Ramona, and hundreds of horses, all kinds of horses: Horses
in training, horses on layup, yearlings, unraced 2-year-olds,
stallions waiting for the next breeding season and about 170
broodmares in California and Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Having worked with her husband while they cranked out three
Eclipse Awards for breeding and six state breeding awards, she does
not need a crash course in the nuances of the game. The sheer
quantity of horseflesh under her watch might be daunting, but she is
not blanching from the task.</TE>
<TE>   "My son and I are well-grounded people," she said. "Larry's spent
his whole life in the family's other businesses, such as grocery
stores and real estate, and he's a man of many talents. He can bring
a lot of those sound business principles to the racing and breeding
side."</TE>
<TE>   The first thing Mabee had to do following her husband's death was
to quash all the rumors. The most obvious speculation was that Golden
Eagle might go away, which would leave a cavernous hole in the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like there was a different story every day, one more
outlandish than the other," Mabee said. "The dumbest one I heard was
that we were considering the sale of all our stallions in a package.
We might need some downsizing, but we're not going to be doing
anything like that."</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Eagle stallion contingent is led by General Meeting,
who after eight crops and almost 300 foals is ranked second, to
Smokester, among California-based stallions. A son of Seattle Slew,
General Meeting has sired General Challenge, winner of the Santa
Anita Derby, Santa Anita Handicap and Pacific Classic, and Excellent
Meeting, a filly who won four Grade I races and earned $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Classic, first run in 1991, is a $1-million race that
John Mabee urged his board to approve in order to give Del Mar an
identity that he felt it lacked. The Mabees won the first running
with Best Pal, who had earned $5.6 million and was already retired
when he suffered a fatal heart attack at the farm in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Betty Mabee looks at Golden Eagle's equine inventory and realizes
that many horses must go.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just got to reduce our breeding and racing stock," she
said. "With all the horses we've accumulated, it can become an
endless cycle. You look at all the 2-year-olds we have, and it just
makes you ill. If we don't do something, we'll end up racing them
against each other when they're ready to run."</TE>
<TE>   Golden Eagle has consigned eight horses--including two fillies and
one colt by General Meeting--for the yearling sale that will be held
at the Del Mar HorsePark on Aug. 11-12, and more Mabee bloodstock
will be seen this fall at California sales as well as at Keeneland in
Lexington, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Betty Mabee has been steeling herself for an opening day
without her husband. She believes in strength in numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "I've invited a lot of the people that John would have had if he
were still here," she said. "People that gave me support at a time
when John wasn't well. He had two strokes, you know, and after the
first one he wasn't totally incapacitated. He actually did quite well
after that. But then the second stroke hit him and that was just too
much."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, will
not run in the Haskell Handicap at Monmouth Park on Aug. 4. He is
likely to run against older horses in the Pacific Classic, another
$1-million race, at Del Mar on Aug. 25. War Emblem is owned by the
Thoroughbred Corp. of Prince Ahmed bin Salman, who died of a heart
attack Monday.... Sunday Break, with a stifle injury, is also out of
the Haskell. The high weight in the race will be Came Home, who was
assigned 122 pounds, two fewer than War Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   The Thoroughbred Corp. has a horse in both divisions of today's
Oceanside Stakes. Johar will run in the first half and Ecstatic is
entered in the second.... With no family members actively involved in
the prince's racing interests, it is likely that his horses will
eventually be sold.... Mizzen Mast, idle since winning the Strub at
Santa Anita in February, won't be ready to run in the San Diego
Handicap on Aug. 4.</TE>

<HD>Roberts Changes Dodgers' Luck</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He sparks two-run rally in seventh inning of 8-6
win over Padres. Gagne gets save.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The umpires blew calls that cost them games, their hard-hit balls
were caught, marginal outfielders robbed them with spectacular
defensive plays, they couldn't catch a break ... blah, blah, blah,
Dodger center fielder Dave Roberts was beginning to think.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm done saying we're snake-bit, we're unlucky, and all that
stuff," Roberts said. "The bottom line is we've had opportunities to
win every single game [since the All-Star break], and we just haven't
found a way.</LD>
<LD>   "You can say all you want about things not going your way, but at
the end of the year we'll either be in the playoffs or out. No one is
going to feel sorry for us. When you're struggling, you're almost
looking for bad things to happen. I want to turn it around and make
our own breaks."</LD>
<TE>   Roberts took his words to heart Tuesday night, sparking a two-run,
tiebreaking rally with a walk and stolen base to lead off the seventh
inning in the Dodgers' 8-6 victory over the San Diego Padres before
25,680 in Qualcomm Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   On a day the Dodgers hoped to bolster their sagging offense with
the acquisition of utility player Tyler Houston in a trade with
Milwaukee, Paul Lo Duca and Adrian Beltre each homered, and the
Dodgers, who had lost 11 of 13 games, scored their most runs since
July 2.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy exhausted almost all of his bullpen, using five
relievers behind starter Andy Ashby, and closer Eric Gagne nailed
down the victory by striking out three of four batters in the ninth
for his 35th save.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the result of us putting pressure on them the whole
game--their pitchers had to work for every out," Roberts said. "The
formula is simple. We hit some big home runs tonight, but we're not a
home run-hitting team. We have to have good at-bats all through the
order."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, who is batting .294 with a .366 on-base percentage, and
Alex Cora had two simple, yet exceptional at-bats in the seventh.
After the Dodgers blew a four-run lead in the sixth, Roberts, with
the score tied, 6-6, opened the seventh with a walk off Padre
reliever Jeremy Fikac and stole second, his 28th stolen base, ranking
him second in the National League.</TE>
<TE>   Cora dropped a perfect sacrifice bunt to the left side, but Padre
third baseman Phil Nevin's throw sailed over Ryan Klesko's head for
an error, allowing Roberts to score and Cora to take second.</TE>
<TE>   Cora took third on Lo Duca's groundout and, after Shawn Green was
intentionally walked, Eric Karros hit a sacrifice fly to center off
reliever Tom Davey to give the Dodgers an 8-6 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "With what Dave Roberts has done for us all year long ... it's
safe to say he's been out there," Tracy said. "This guy has been on
base, he's stealing bases, getting big hits, driving in big runs."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts had some company Tuesday night. The Dodgers, who scored 29
runs in the previous 12 games, an average of 2.4 runs a game, scored
three runs in the third to take a 3-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby singled with one out, Cora singled with two out, and Lo
Duca, mired in a one-for-25 slump, hit a towering, three-run home run
to left, the Dodgers' first home run in seven games, Lo Duca's sixth
homer of the season and his first with runners on base.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre's two-out solo homer in the fourth made it 4-2, and the
Dodgers increased it to 6-2 in the fifth when Lo Duca doubled with
two out, Green singled and Karros hit a two-run double to
right-center to snap his streak of 12 games without a run batted in.</TE>
<TE>   But Ashby and relievers Jesse Orosco and Giovanni Carrara couldn't
hold it. Pinch-hitter Gene Kingsale's two-run triple and Ramon
Vazquez's RBI groundout in the sixth pulled San Diego within 6-5, and
Ron Gant, who made two spectacular defensive plays to thwart the
Dodgers Monday night, grounded an RBI single to right off Carrara to
tie the score, 6-6.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers, who moved into second place in the NL West but
remained 2 1/2 games behind Arizona, recovered to mount a
counter-strike in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in an offensive rut--we were setting up innings but not
finishing them," Tracy said. "But we did a very good job of
sustaining an attack tonight with good consecutive at-bats."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Get Houston in a Trade</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Utility player is acquired from Brewers for two
minor leaguers, adding power and versatility to the bench.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers added some power and versatility to their bench and a
potential motivational tool for their underachieving third baseman
when they acquired utility player Tyler Houston from the Milwaukee
Brewers on Tuesday for minor league pitchers Ben Diggins and Shane
Nance.</LD>
<LD>   Houston, who his batting .302 with seven homers and 33 runs batted
in, can play third base, first base and the outfield, has some
experience as a catcher and should add some pop to a bench that is
the weakest of the three teams--Arizona, San Francisco and Los
Angeles--competing for the National League West title.</LD>
<LD>   But the left-handed hitting Houston's best position is third base,
and with Adrian Beltre batting .238 with 10 homers and 37 RBIs before
Tuesday's game against San Diego, it's very possible Houston could
platoon with Beltre, providing more balance to a predominantly
right-handed-hitting lineup that has averaged 2.5 runs since the
All-Star break.</LD>
<TE>   "We need another left-handed hitter, but I'm not going to suggest
this is the outs for Adrian Beltre," Manager Jim Tracy said.
"[Houston] creates all sorts of options for us."</TE>
<TE>   Some in the organization, however, believe Beltre, 23, would
benefit from a little competition, because he has never really been
pushed in five seasons. And with the Dodgers in a three-team race for
the division title, they can't afford to be too patient while Beltre
struggles to find a consistent stroke.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're in a situation at this time of the year where
the object is to win games," Tracy said. "You have to use the people
you need to win games, and right now, offensively, we're not really
driving the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Beltre said the trade should help the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm cool with anything here," said Beltre, who homered in the
fourth inning Tuesday night. "I'm not the one making the decision. I
know I'm not playing good, so I can't tell them anything. I can't be
mad or disagree with it because I'm not playing the way I should be
playing right now."</TE>
<TE>   Houston, who has a .347 on-base percentage, 15 doubles and two
triples, was ecstatic about going from a team with the second-worst
record (34-67) in the major leagues to a team in playoff contention.
He will join the Dodgers on Friday in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally excited about being a Dodger," Houston, 31, said by
telephone from Houston, where the Brewers lost to the Astros on
Tuesday. "Being in contention will bring more spark, more fun to the
game, because it's been hard going to the park for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Houston, who grew up in Long Beach and was a huge Dodger fan as a
kid, said he'd be very interested in re-signing with the Dodgers
after this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who will receive a player to be named from Milwaukee
as part of the deal, will be responsible for about $600,000 of
Houston's $1.625-million contract. Houston will be a free agent after
this season.</TE>
<TE>   To make room for Houston on the 25-man roster, the Dodgers
probably will designate reserve outfielder Hiram Bocachica for
assignment. To make room on the 40-man roster for Houston, the
Dodgers designated triple-A pitcher Craig House for assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good player, a good utility guy," Dodger right fielder
Shawn Green said of Houston, whose pinch-hit, three-run home sparked
an eight-run, seventh-inning rally that gave the Brewers an 8-6
victory over the Dodgers on May 21.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a little pop in his bat. It's a good pickup."</TE>
<TE>   Diggins was a first-round pick in 2000, a right-hander who signed
for $1.5 million out of the University of Arizona, but he had only
progressed to Class-A Vero Beach, where he was 6-10 with a 3.63
earned-run average and 101 strikeouts in 114 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Nance, an 11th-round pick in 2000, was 11-3 with a 4.17 ERA for
triple-A Las Vegas. The left-hander earned the victory at the
triple-A All-Star game.</TE>

<LD>What are arguably the two most anticipated race meets of the year
begin today.</LD>
<LD>   Four hours after Saratoga begins its 36-day run at Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., Del Mar kicks off its seven-week season.</LD>
<LD>   Some things never change by the beach. As usual, the first race is
a route, meaning the race will start in front of the grandstand and
there will be a roar from the crowd when track announcer Trevor
Denman sends the field of $20,000 3-year-olds on its way.</LD>
<TE>   The second race is on the turf--that also has become a
tradition--and the third is a maiden sprint for 2-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   The Oceanside Stakes again will be run in two divisions. The first
prep for the $300,000 Del Mar Derby on Sept. 7, the Oceanside, which
is run at one mile on the turf, has been run in divisions every year
since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain Rage, a winner of three consecutive turf stakes during
the winter and spring at Santa Anita, heads the stronger first
division. Trained by Bob Baffert, who has led the standings five
consecutive years at Del Mar, Mountain Rage will be favored against a
field that includes Rock Opera and Johar.</TE>
<TE>   In the second division, Mutinyonthebounty, a winner of two of four
in Ireland, England and France, will make his U.S. debut for trainer
Beau Greely.</TE>
<TE>   Saratoga will start its meet with a 10-race card. The main event
is the $150,000 Schuylerville Stakes, a Grade II at six furlongs for
2-year-old fillies.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Full fields are the norm at Del Mar and the
second is a particularly contentious event for older claimers at 1
1/16 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Baffert. In the last five Del Mar meets, he has won 133
races. He has won the Del Mar Futurity six years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: A.C. Avila. The trainer, who was winless at Hollywood
Park, will try to get off to a better start at Del Mar when he sends
out Great Alarm in the first and Pick Of The Valley in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Taormina and California
Lite in the fourth, singling Mountain Rage in the fifth and using A
Touch Of Grey, My Friend Lumpy, Kinston and Window B. in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Final for Hollywood Park: 3/169. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $14.20/$954.80. Total money bet: $1,120.</TE>

<LD>   St. Louis has Thomas penciled in to start as a weakside
linebacker.</LD>
<LD>   He was a three-year starter at middle linebacker at UCLA.</LD>
<TE>   The outside spot generally entails more pass-coverage
responsibilities, but the Rams believe that with his 4.5 speed in the
40-yard dash, Thomas is capable of handling the pass-coverage duties.</TE>

<HD>Diamondbacks Rally to Defeat Rockies</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quinton McCracken hit a two-run double and Tony Womack followed with
a two-run homer as the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied in the eighth
inning to defeat the Colorado Rockies, 8-5, Tuesday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   The Diamondbacks took a 4-1 lead into the eighth before both teams
scored four times.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona closer Byung-Hyun Kim blew his fourth save in 30 chances,
giving up a three-run double to Juan Uribe that capped Colorado's
comeback. Kim (4-1) wound up with the win.</LD>
<TE>   Todd Jones (1-2) got the loss after giving up all four Arizona
runs in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Womack drove in three runs, hitting a run-scoring single in the
fifth before his drive into the right-field seats in the eighth. It
was his second homer and first since April 6--a span of 329 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grace also homered for Arizona. Junior Spivey doubled twice
and singled.</TE>
<TE>   Spivey's two-run double gave the Diamondbacks a 4-1 lead in the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona starter Brian Anderson left after giving up a double to
Brent Butler with one out in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Walker followed with a run-scoring single off reliever Mike
Myers, a left-handed specialist who then hit Todd Helton with a
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, San Francisco 0--Matt Morris pitched eight sharp
innings and Jim Edmonds homered to lead the Cardinals at San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Tino Martinez hit a two-run double and Edmonds added an RBI double
for the Cardinals, who won their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The injury-riddled Giants, playing with a depleted lineup, lost
for the third time in four games.</TE>
<TE>   Morris (12-6) struck out eight to beat the Giants for the second
consecutive start. He gave up six hits and walked three.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds, Jeff Kent and Reggie Sanders, the Giants' Nos. 3-4-5
hitters, all missed the game with various injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was out with a right hamstring strain and could miss up to a
week. Kent missed his second straight game with soreness in his upper
leg, and Sanders was out with a mild right hamstring strain.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Montreal 3--Mike Piazza and Mo Vaughn each hit two-run
homers at New York and Jeff D'Amico won for the first time in nearly
two months.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos lost their fifth straight game, but more importantly
watched All-Star right fielder Vladimir Guerrero leave because of a
bruised left knee after crashing into the wall to rob Jeromy Burnitz
of an extra-base hit.</TE>
<TE>   The catch was one of the only highlights for the slumping Expos,
who less than two weeks ago seemed poised to make a surprising run at
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   But after acquiring slugger Cliff Floyd on July 11, the Expos are
just 3-10. Floyd has offered little help, batting only .200 with two
RBIs for Montreal. He was hitless in 17 at-bats before doubling in
the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets, who looked lost coming out of the All-Star break, have
won eight of 10 to move four games over .500 for the first time since
May 31 and back into wild-card contention.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, Florida 3--Henry Blanco and Rafael Furcal had RBI
singles in a three-run fifth inning at Miami as Tom Glavine and the
Braves ended the Marlins' four-game win streak.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine drove in a run with a suicide squeeze and won for the
second time in as many starts--both against Florida--after six
winless outings.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up three runs and nine hits in 5 1/3 innings for his 237th
victory, moving past Whitey Ford for 50th place on the career list.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Milwaukee 4--Pete Munro pitched seven strong innings at
Houston as the Astros sent Milwaukee to its ninth straight loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros are 4-0 in the games Munro has started since being
called up from triple-A on June 27.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, Chicago 4--Scott Rolen hit a tiebreaking three-run
homer in the seventh inning at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   With the score 4-all, Matt Clement hit Pat Burrell with a pitch
with two out in the seventh and gave up a single to Travis Lee.
Rolen, the first batter to face Kyle Farnsworth, sent a 3-and-2 pitch
through a strong wind into the left-field bleachers for his 16th
homer of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 7, Pittsburgh 2--Austin Kearns drove in four runs and
Reggie Taylor had his first career pinch-hit homer at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Kearns drove in runs with an infield single and a double off Kip
Wells and later added a sacrifice fly, making the Pirates pay for
walking Ken Griffey Jr. ahead of him all three times.</TE>

<LD>Newly appointed France Coach Jacques Santini will not be shaking up
the national team, even though the reigning European and former world
champion was ousted in the first round of the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   "Why should I change everything?" Santini, 50, asked in an
interview with France Football magazine published Tuesday. "Have you
heard of a top player or a top team who never failed?</LD>
<LD>   "Most of the players who will play qualifying games will be the
players who competed in the last international tournaments."</LD>
<TE>   Defending champion France was drawn into an easy qualifying group
for the 2004 European Championship in Portugal, with only Cyprus,
Israel, Malta and Slovenia standing in its way.</TE>
<TE>   Santini could have an additional task soon. FIFA is expected to
award the 2003 Confederations Cup to France rather than selecting the
United States to play host to the eight-nation tournament next
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Milan Eyes Rivaldo</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian midfielder and World Cup winner Rivaldo, a free agent
since his release by Barcelona, is being pursued by AC Milan.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, who doubles as
president of AC Milan, has given the go-ahead for the team to try to
sign Rivaldo, 30, even though he probably will demand a large signing
bonus and a salary close to the $7.5 million per year he was earning
in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo said in a television interview in Spain that the return of
Dutch Coach Luis Van Gaal to Barcelona was the reason he and the club
had agreed to part.</TE>
<TE>   "Van Gaal is the main cause of my departure," he said. "I don't
like Van Gaal and I am sure he doesn't like me, either."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. to Play Denmark</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. under-21 women's national team will play Denmark today
and Greece on Friday as it tries to defend its title in the
eight-nation Nordic Cup tournament in Finland. A goal by Penn State's
Joanna Lohman gave the U.S. a 1-0 victory over host Finland in the
opening game Monday. The Americans must win their group to reach
Sunday's championship game.</TE>
<TE>   MLS Adds All-Stars</TE>
<TE>   Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber used his
commissioner's picks to add midfielders Marco Etcheverry of D.C.
United and Joselito Vaca of the Dallas Burn to the league's All-Star
team that will play the U.S. national team Aug. 3 at RFK Stadium in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Selected as reserves by San Jose Earthquake Coach Frank Yallop,
who will coach the All-Star team, were Earthquake goalkeeper Joe
Cannon, defender Wade Barrett and forward Ariel Graziani, as well
midfielder Chris Klein of the Kansas City Wizards and Dallas forward
Jason Kreis.</TE>
<TE>   Gazza to MLS?</TE>
<TE>   Free agent Paul Gascoigne, 35, will be given a tryout Friday by
D.C. United, which would have to clear room under the salary cap to
bring the former England national team midfielder to MLS.</TE>

<TE>   Update--If the playoffs began today this would be a first-round
matchup, which is why the game is important to Portland. The Fire is
the hot team, winning 10 of its last 11 games. But Portland is 1-7
lifetime against the Sparks, and has lost the last five meetings
between the teams. Ukari Figgs continues to make the draft-day trade
between Portland and Los Angeles look good for the Fire, averaging
9.4 points and 3.5 assists. Figgs is also the WNBA's top free-throw
shooter (.927). Spark forward Latasha Byears, sidelined the last two
games because of a stress fracture in her right knee, is day-to-day.</TE>

<HD>Williams' Children Are Unable to Settle Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INVERNESS, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Two of Ted Williams' children withdrew their request to settle
privately the dispute with their half sister over the Hall of Famer's
remains.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Goldman, an attorney for John Henry Williams and Claudia
Williams, filed the motion in Citrus County Circuit Court on Tuesday,
saying the elder daughter, Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell, has "no
intention of making any good faith effort to reach a private
understanding."</LD>
<LD>   Ted Williams died July 5 and his body was then sent to be frozen
at Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona, under the orders of
John Henry Williams and Claudia Williams. Ferrell is seeking to
retrieve her father's body from the Arizona lab, cremate it and
sprinkle his ashes off the coast of Florida, as Williams' will
dictates.</LD>
<TE>   Neither Goldman nor Ferrell's attorney, Richard Fitzpatrick,
immediately returned calls Tuesday seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Chip Tuttle, a spokesman for Williams' estate, said: "It appears
the Williams family will not be able to resolve this matter privately
and will move forward to seek help from the court."</TE>

<HD>Top-Seeded Haas Gets Run Out by Qualifier</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Bogomolov, ranked No. 278 in the world, wins by
6-4, 6-4 upset in first round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alex Bogomolov Jr., a 19-year-old qualifier from Miami, upset
top-seeded Tommy Haas of Germany, 6-4, 6-4, in a late-night
first-round match of the Mercedes-Benz Cup on Tuesday night at Los
Angeles Tennis Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm feeling incredible," Bogomolov said. "I've been waiting for
this a long time, my whole life. It hasn't kicked in yet. I'm going
to dream about it tonight and wake up and tomorrow hope it's real."</LD>
<LD>   Bogomolov, ranked No. 278 in the world, broke Haas, ranked third,
in the first and ninth games of the first set and the third and fifth
games of the second set to pull off the victory.</LD>
<TE>   Haas was playing his first tournament since losing in the fourth
round of the French Open.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, his parents were seriously injured in a motorcycle
accident June 8, and Haas took time off to be with them.</TE>
<TE>   "When you haven't competed in a while, you get a little rusty,"
Haas said. "I obviously gotta get back into it, get my mind back into
it, but I don't really think it was anything mentally on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like my parents are in good hands now, and I feel like I
can get back to my thing, but it's going to take a couple of weeks."</TE>
<TE>   At least one match followed form.</TE>
<TE>   The fearsome topspin forehands, two-fisted backhand brilliance
from the baseline and devastating determination were all there,
unleashed on Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark with predictable results. No.
2-seeded Andre Agassi rolled over Carlsen, 6-3, 6-1, in a first-round
match.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi, the tournament winner last year and in 1998, broke Carlsen
in the eighth game of the first set and gained momentum from there,
taking command in the second set.</TE>
<TE>   Carlsen won the first game, but Agassi took the last five in a row
to begin his quest to become the first player to win the tournament
twice in a row since Richard Krajicek in 1992 and '93.</TE>
<TE>   That just might help take the sting out of a year that Agassi said
has been disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   A seven-time Grand Slam winner, he did not play the Australian
Open because of a wrist injury and lost in the quarterfinals of the
French Open and the second round at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   His lone tournament title was in a clay-court event in Rome, and
before Tuesday, he hadn't played since Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't going out expecting to play very well. I just tried to
have a good work ethic tonight," he said. "I need to get out there
and get to work. It's a great challenge at this particular moment.
This can still be a great year, but it's going to take a lot of hard
work."</TE>
<TE>   Carlsen, ranked 107th in the world, actually made Agassi, ranked
seventh, work in the first set, showing impressive depth and variety
on his shots as he attempted to move Agassi back and forth and off
the baseline.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like there was some good versatility, and I got a look at
a lot of different kinds of shots," Agassi said.</TE>
<TE>   Carlsen broke in the third game of the first set for a 2-1 edge,
but Agassi broke back the next game, and called the shots thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   In other first-round matches:</TE>
<TE>   George Bastl of Switzerland, who upset Pete Sampras in the second
round at Wimbledon, could not get past a healthy Gustavo Kuerten.</TE>
<TE>   Kuerten won, 7-5, 7-6 (7), in his first hard-court match since a
first-round loss to Julien Boutter of France at the Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel well. I felt efficient," Kuerten said. "I wish I could
play more matches to get the competition feeling. There's an energy
by competition that you only get by playing."</TE>
<TE>   Kuerten entered the tournament gingerly after undergoing
arthroscopic surgery on his right hip Feb. 26.</TE>
<TE>   The three-time French Open champion, seeded fifth in this
tournament, has played sparingly this year and his best showing on
any surface has been in the quarterfinals of clay events at Mallorca,
Spain, and Hamburg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice. I like this tournament," he said. "I feel much, much
better. I feel comfortable. I have a little more confidence in my
game and my body."</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Sebastien Grosjean soundly beat American qualifier Jack
Brasington, 6-1, 6-2, after recovering from a strained left thigh.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CARRILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as swift as he is on the hard court, Brian Vahaly has done the
same in the ATP rankings.</LD>
<LD>   Vahaly, a main-draw wild card at the Mercedes-Benz Cup, has moved
488 spots on the ATP Tour in the last 12 months. It's the fastest
gain of any player ranked in the top 200.</LD>
<LD>   Not bad for a player two years removed from the University of
Virginia.</LD>
<TE>   Vahaly just turned 23 and is ranked 118th in the world.</TE>
<TE>   And if he continues to play the way he did at UCLA's Grandstand on
Tuesday, he could crack the top 100 soon.</TE>
<TE>   Vahaly used his quickness and took advantage of a frustrated
Davide Sanguinetti of Italy, upsetting the 54th-ranked player, 6-3,
6-1, in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Sanguinetti, smacking the ball over the venue wall on the last
return, stormed off the court angry at a handful of linesmen calls.</TE>
<TE>   "They are so bad," said Sanguinetti referring to the judges as he
cleared a path to avoid fans outside the venue. "The calls they made
didn't give me a chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   Next for Vahaly is a second-round match today against No. 4 Andy
Roddick.</TE>
<TE>   And Vahaly, who won his second ATP Tour match, doesn't believe
Roddick will be easily frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   "He's usually doing the frustrating with his 140-mph serves," said
Vahaly, four years older than Roddick. "I'm just going to have to
fight off his serves. It will be tough, but I have nothing to lose."</TE>
<TE>   "He's at the top and I'm just trying to get there someday. Vahaly,
from Atlanta, jumped on Sanguinetti, who is enjoying his best year
with two titles. Sanguinetti struggled returning serves with his
backhand, recording only eight of 29 points.</TE>
<TE>   Sanguinetti sprayed the ball everywhere and even appeared to aim
one at a linesman.</TE>
<TE>   Vahaly took the first set, 6-3, and easily won the first two games
of the second. Sanguinetti took the third game, but after falling
behind began yelling at chair umpire Tony Nimmons over calls.</TE>
<TE>   He even threw his racket onto the court, causing fans to cheer.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had him right there," said Vahaly after hearing
Sanguinetti tell Nimmons the calls were brutal. "The calls went both
ways and you just never want to get caught up in that.</TE>
<TE>   "It just slows you down and I just want to keep moving."</TE>

<HD>Armstrong Stays in Good Position</HD>
<DH>Cycling: He catches up to Beloki of Spain near finish line
and maintains overall lead of 4:21.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LES DEUX-ALPES, France</DL>
<LD>Spanish rival Joseba Beloki surprised Lance Armstrong briefly in
Tuesday's 15th stage--the longest of the Tour de France at 140.43
miles--by surging ahead in the final stretch.</LD>
<LD>   But Armstrong kept his overall lead of 4 minutes 21 seconds by
giving chase and crossing the line just behind Beloki to clock the
same time.</LD>
<LD>   "Les Deux-Alpes, it's not too hard, it's not good for attacking,"
Armstrong said after the stage, which Colombian rider Santiago Botero
won in 5:55:16.</LD>
<TE>   Armstrong was ninth, 6:41 off the pace but remains on target to
win his fourth consecutive Tour.</TE>
<TE>   The mountain stage from Vaison-la-Romaine in the southern Provence
region to this ski station was the first in the Alps this year. But
it wasn't as hard as the two earlier legs in the Pyrenees--both won
by Armstrong--or the trek to the top of the Mont Ventoux, in which he
extended his lead.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it is much easier than today's stretch from Les Deux-Alpes
to La Plagne, which features three exceptionally difficult climbs.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong prefers to be aggressive and attack in the harder
stages, in which rivals are less likely to match his pace. At the
Plateau de Beille in the Pyrenees and on the Ventoux, the Texan left
Beloki stranded as he sprinted to the summit.</TE>
<TE>   The ride to La Plagne takes Armstrong over the Col de la Madeleine
mountain pass, which he tackled last year in one of his biggest stage
wins. Memorably, he grimaced in apparent pain during that climb, then
sprinted up the last stretch to L'Alpe d'Huez. He later acknowledged
he had bluffed his rivals into thinking he was tiring.</TE>
<TE>   Botero's win was his second in this Tour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 Tour champion, Jan Ullrich, was banned from cycling for
six months after testing positive for amphetamines.</TE>
<TE>   Ullrich was given half the maximum suspension and was fined
$1,400, the German cycling federation said.</TE>
<TE>   A three-person disciplinary panel decided to impose the minimum
penalty because it determined that Ullrich did not take the
amphetamines to enhance his performance.</TE>

<TE>   At a Glance</TE>
<TE>   Highlights from the 15th stage of the Tour de France:</TE>
<TE>   Stage: 140.43 miles from Vaison-la-Romaine in the southern
Provence region to Les Deux-Alpes, a ski station. It's the longest
stage of this year's race.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Santiago Botero of Colombia, in 5 hours 55 minutes 16
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   How others fared: Three-time defending champion Lance Armstrong
retained the overall lead despite finishing the stage in ninth place,
6:41 behind Botero. Armstrong's lead over second-place Joseba Beloki
in the overall standings was unchanged at 4:21.</TE>
<TE>   Next stage: 111.5 miles from Les Deux-Alpes to La Plagne,
featuring three exceptionally difficult climbs.</TE>

<HD>Williams Is Facing the Hidden Truth</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Enigmatic running back, now with Dolphins,
has been battling social-anxiety disorder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a running back for the New Orleans Saints, Ricky Williams would
repeatedly hurl his body into a wall of 300-pound defensive linemen,
yet he was too unnerved to take off his helmet during interviews. He
would allow his mail to accumulate for days, fearful his neighbors
were watching his every move. Even trips to the grocery store turned
into harrowing ordeals.</LD>
<LD>   "I would hide from people in the store," he said. "If I saw
someone, or if I thought someone was looking at me, I'd run to the
next aisle."</LD>
<LD>   Williams, 25, who now plays for the Miami Dolphins, rapidly
developed a reputation as one of the NFL's strangest players, a
Heisman Trophy winner whose accomplishments on the field were
eclipsed by his bizarre personal antics. It wasn't until a year ago
that he was diagnosed with social-anxiety disorder, a syndrome that
leaves sufferers with an intense fear of scrutiny by people in social
situations. With therapy and medication, he has made what he and
others believe are dramatic steps toward a normal lifestyle.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm finally at peace with myself," he said Tuesday. "I'm getting
through this. I'm definitely at a point where I can help a lot of
people."</TE>
<TE>   According to the National Institute of Mental Health,
social-anxiety disorder, which affects about 5.3 million adult
Americans, usually begins in childhood or early adolescence and can
be treated successfully with targeted psychotherapy or medications.</TE>
<TE>   Painfully shy since his childhood in San Diego, Williams said he
did not feel the full effects of the disorder until his rookie season
with the Saints. He sought therapy when he hit an emotional rock
bottom a year ago, was diagnosed with the disorder and began taking
Paxil, an antidepressant for which Williams is a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Williams will discuss his disorder with reporters today in a
national conference call. He is being paid to speak out about his
problem by GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Paxil.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking out also helps him lay the groundwork for a fresh start
with the Dolphins, who traded for him in the off-season and see him
as the missing piece for a franchise that has had only three
1,000-yard running backs since 1973. The Dolphins, who begin training
camp Monday, sent New Orleans this year's first-round pick and a
third-rounder next year that would escalate to a first-rounder if
Williams rushes for 1,500 yards this season.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how he plays, Williams figures he can serve as an
inspiration to anxiety sufferers everywhere. After all, there once
was a time he was too fearful to leave his New Orleans home, let
alone sign autographs and chat with fans.</TE>
<TE>   "After the season, I'd wake up in the morning, then lay around the
house all day," he said. "I'd get dressed and walk toward the door to
go out, then I'd sit down thinking, 'Naw, I'll probably see somebody
out there.' I don't really watch TV, so I had nothing to do."</TE>
<TE>   He spent much of his time tinkering with gadgets he would use for
a few days, then shelve. He used the Internet to buy three Palm
Pilots. "Anyone who knows me, knows I'm not one to be organized," he
said. He also bought a portable DVD player and two camcorders. "I had
nowhere to use them; I never left the house."</TE>
<TE>   If forced to attend a dinner event, he would hide in the restroom
until the last possible moment. He hunkered down on flights, staring
out the window the whole way. He always asked for tables in the dark
corners of restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Most puzzling was his refusal to take off his helmet--complete
with darkened visor--during interviews. He would sit on the floor in
front of his locker and speak so softly that questioners would have
to kneel to hear his responses. Once, quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver
eavesdropped on a Williams interview and stage-whispered commentary.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Texas call him Ricky Williams, but he's really Ricky
Weirdo," Tolliver joked. "I'm telling you, he's going to go postal
one day."</TE>
<TE>   The dread-locked Williams struggled mightily throughout his rookie
season, rushing for 884 yards in 12 games--1,240 yards fewer than he
gained in 11 games as a senior at Texas. He scored 28 touchdowns in
his final season as a Longhorn and two as a rookie for the Saints.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he was the only member of that New Orleans draft class.
Former coach Mike Ditka traded all of the team's picks to Washington
in order to move up and grab Williams with the No. 3 selection. The
two struck a now-famous pose on the cover of ESPN The Magazine, with
Ditka as groom and Williams as bride.</TE>
<TE>   Is it odd that a football player so sensitive to watchful eyes
would agree to wear a wedding dress on the front of a national
magazine?</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was funny," Williams said. "I wasn't aware that I
had social-anxiety disorder at the time, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Williams struggled with injuries throughout his three seasons with
the Saints but became progressively more productive. He rushed for
1,000 yards in 2000 and 1,245 last season. Ditka was gone, though,
and Williams never truly connected with Coach Jim Haslett, who saw
him as flaky and noncommittal.</TE>
<TE>   And Williams was. He flirted with a professional baseball career,
almost walking away from football after his second season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 22 years old and had all the money I'd ever dreamed of," he
said. "But I wasn't happy."</TE>
<TE>   He spent that summer in San Diego, his hometown, and a friend's
mother found a psychological therapist for him. When he returned to
Louisiana, he began sessions with Janey B. Barnes, a therapist in
Baton Rouge. She diagnosed his disorder.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first met him, he was unable to look me or anyone else in
the eye," Barnes said. "He would duck his head, turn his head away.
He was frightened by people looking directly at him and had
difficulty speaking with people one on one.</TE>
<TE>   "Teammates thought he was just this arrogant kid who didn't want
to be a team player. He desperately wanted to be one."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to therapy, Barnes recommended him to a doctor who
prescribed the medication. The results were dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the months," Barnes said, "he's made a lot of headway."</TE>
<TE>   Although he has become more comfortable in public settings during
the past year, Williams has still had problems with coaches and
run-ins with the law. He was arrested in Crowley, La., in February
for driving 126 mph, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest in
April after he missed a court date. He resolved the matter by paying
a fine.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., pulled him over last month and
ticketed him for driving without a license and having an expired tag.
The Dolphins arranged get-to-know-you meetings between Williams and
the Fort Lauderdale chief of police.</TE>
<TE>   Saint players were levied $180,000 in fines last season for
missing or being late to team meetings and various other offenses.
Williams was responsible for $85,000, taking a serious bite out of
his paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   "There were times when Ricky felt like he was paying the Saints
for the right to play football," agent Leigh Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those slip-ups are attributable to youth, Steinberg says,
and to the fact Williams had no natural peer group as a rookie
because he was the only draft pick.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is convinced things will be different in Miami, and looks
forward to "playing for a coach [Dave Wannstedt] who likes me." He
has taken up photography and Web-site design and now says he feels at
ease in public settings. He has even gotten a chance to use some of
those gadgets he bought during his homebound days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible," he said. "It's a chance to start over."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel players voted Tuesday to authorize the executive board of the
Major League Baseball Players Assn. to set a strike date.</LD>
<LD>   Pitcher Scott Schoeneweis, the Angels' player representative, said
the Angels unanimously approved the measure during a meeting before
batting practice.</LD>
<LD>   "If we do set a strike date, it's in order to spur the negotiation
process," Schoeneweis said. "If the negotiations aren't spurred by
that, we would have to strike.</LD>
<TE>   "That's the purpose of setting a date, to hopefully get things
moving."</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis said possible strike dates were discussed, but he
would not specify what those dates were and would not say if the
Angels voted on a specific date.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure when the actual date needs to be set," Schoeneweis
said. "Obviously, it would be set and made public to allow both sides
to get to the table to not have to reach that climax."</TE>
<TE>   The Times, citing baseball sources, reported Monday that the union
had tentatively targeted Sept. 16 to begin the sport's ninth work
stoppage unless progress is made quickly in negotiations. In response
to the report, Don Fehr, executive director of the union, informed
players in a memorandum a date had not been selected.</TE>
<TE>   "That [date] has not been discussed, has not been voted upon and
has not been approved," Schoeneweis said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy raised his batting average to .301
Sunday with two hits against the Seattle Mariners, but he was not in
the lineup against left-hander Barry Zito on Tuesday. Benji Gil
started in his place.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, who bats left-handed, sat regularly against left-handers
during the second half of last season. He was batting .245 in 49
at-bats against left-handers this season and .313 in 233 at-bats
against right-handers.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy pinch-hit in the ninth for Gil and got aboard on an error
but was stranded at second base.</TE>
<TE>   Gil, who bats right-handed, was batting .356 in 45 at-bats against
left-handers. He went 0 for 2 with a walk Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Serving Up Hope</HD>
<DH>Dedication, a cornerstone of Agassi's career, is essence of
his school</DH>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Neat in their crimson and navy uniforms, safe in this brick courtyard
shadowed by barred windows, the forgotten children of this town's
forgotten neighborhood gather at their school for morning
announcements.</LD>
<LD>   A little hand shoots up.</LD>
<LD>   There are no tennis courts here, no tennis photos here, no tennis
spoken here.</LD>
<TE>   But the little hand belongs to a little boy who cannot help
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Tanaka?" he asks the principal. "My mother said that Mr.
Agassi is playing this morning at Wimbledon. Can we give him a good
thought?"</TE>
<TE>   The principal nods and, instantly, another little hand shoots up,
then another, then another.</TE>
<TE>   The children are pointing to a place 5,000 miles away, then, just
as suddenly, they are praying.</TE>
<TE>   Their hands still raised, their scratchy pleadings fill the sky
with the sounds of a most unusual pep rally.</TE>
<TE>   "Good luck, Mr. Agassi!"</TE>
<TE>   "Do your best, Mr. Agassi!"</TE>
<TE>   "We're thinking about you, Mr. Agassi."</TE>
<TE>   Across the ocean, the founder of the Andre Agassi College
Preparatory Academy is listening.</TE>
<TE>   "I hear the children all the time," Andre Agassi says softly. "I
hear them on the court. I hear them in my sleep."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some athletes give autographs.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi teaches children how to write.</TE>
<TE>   Some athletes hang around needy children for an afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi is hanging around for a childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Using nearly $2 million of his own money, he has helped build and
open a public school that is the antithesis of his city and his
sport.</TE>
<TE>   Located in the capital of glitz, it sits amid dull, sagging houses
and trash-lined streets.</TE>
<TE>   Built with money made on a tour known for selfish brats, it is a
gleaming brick and steel monument to selflessness.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all learned, if you take away hope, you create a suicide
bomb," Agassi said. "More than anything, this is about hope."</TE>
<TE>   Hope, in the form of 150 children from mostly single-parent,
depressed homes.</TE>
<TE>   Hope, with no tuition and admission based on a blind lottery.</TE>
<TE>   Hope, with an Agassi attitude.</TE>
<TE>   The hours are longer than a regular public school, there are
classes on Saturday, and expectations are high.</TE>
<TE>   If children break rules, they work with the school janitor to
instruct them on life without schooling.</TE>
<TE>   If the parents aren't actively involved with the children's work,
both are asked to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "Before you get here, you hear both good and bad," said Calinda
Wells, mother of third-grader Caleah. "But when you get here, you
realize, it's all good.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, they push your kids to excel. Yes, they demand respect. But
no, that's not bad."</TE>
<TE>   The school is already so popular after one year that there are
more than 150 people on a waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   More amazingly, after one year the school is still spotless inside
and unmarked by graffiti outside.</TE>
<TE>   "There really aren't words to describe it," Las Vegas councilman
Lawrence Weekly said.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Catha had words, in the form of a scream, when she learned
that her third-grade son Paul had been admitted this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I grabbed the letter out of the mailbox and couldn't help
myself," she said. "Everybody in the neighborhood is talking about
this place."</TE>
<TE>   And talking about Agassi, who, at 32, has made the difficult leap
from the cover of tabloids to the dignified position as one of this
country's leading public service athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "God bless Mr. Agassi," said Anita Earl-King, a mother of one of
the students. "I don't know much about tennis, but I know about this
community, and what he's done for us has made him a hero here."</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, local bookmakers would not have dared make odds on
tennis' fast-lane, hard-charging star using his legacy to embrace
children so unlike him.</TE>
<TE>   The school is mostly African American, mostly poor, mostly kids
who have never even owned a tennis racket.</TE>
<TE>   "People have actually come up to me and said, 'Why can't we find a
black person to come in here and do this?' '' Weekly said. "My answer
has always been, 'I don't care if this man is green and he's from
Mars. Andre's heart is in the right place and his money is honest."</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, you would have thought Brooke Shields would go bald
before Agassi would be spotted listening to children serenade him
with, "Wind Beneath My Wings."</TE>
<TE>   But that is what happened last fall during one of the school's
first open house ceremonies, catching the founder by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I stood there with tears streaming down my face," Agassi said.
"It was so pure ... so pure."</TE>
<TE>   Pure joy, during the half-dozen times that Agassi has visited the
place.</TE>
<TE>   Pure hell, during those moments when he's trying to figure out how
to pay for the rest of it.</TE>
<TE>   The school began with grades 3-5 last year. It will add sixth
grade this year, and continue adding grades every year until the
school serves kindergarten through 12th grade.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of completing the school will be an additional $26
million.</TE>
<TE>   The state is loaning them the land and paying money for every
student, as with any public school. Contributions from various
fund-raisers also help, particularly the annual Agassi Foundation
Gala here in late September, which has raised as much as $4 million
in one night.</TE>
<TE>   But Agassi knows the bucks literally stop with him.</TE>
<TE>   And he knows that he no longer has a choice.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten pretty scared about it at times," he said Sunday
afternoon while preparing to defend his title in the Mercedes-Benz
Cup at UCLA.. "The idea of all these kids counting on you ....</TE>
<TE>   "I have got to come up with that money. You can't take a child
from third to sixth grade and then say, 'Good luck!' "</TE>
<TE>   Especially not now, with success stories flying around the desert
like an Agassi volley.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on plastic slipcovers in her modest home several miles
away, Anita Earl-King talked about her fourth-grade son Jamaal.</TE>
<TE>   He was told he had reading problems. He was told he would always
be behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we go to Agassi, and they tell him that he can read well,
and they work with him until he does," said the medical clerk. "They
gave us hope. They showed us Jamaal can be whatever he wants to be."</TE>
<TE>   There are certain days during the year when students are not
required to wear uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   "But Jamaal is so proud of his school, he wears his uniform on
those days anyway," Earl-King said.</TE>
<TE>   There are dozens of stories like that one from Agassi parents,
many of whom have never seen him play tennis, and couldn't care less.</TE>
<TE>   They bring their children to a school where, on a recent morning,
a third-grade teacher hands out that night's homework to a class
cheer.</TE>
<TE>   "And why do we cheer?" asks the teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "Because if we gripe, we get more homework," chant the students.</TE>
<TE>   When the school opened last year, not one student was reading at
grade level. After one year, the entire school is at least at grade
level.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder that during a recent trip to the supermarket,
Agassi was stopped by a woman begging for an application for her
child?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm amazed by the entire thing as much as anybody," Agassi said.
"I'm not a bright person. But I surround myself with people who are
smarter than me."</TE>
<TE>   The idea for a school came from that team, which was reacting to
the work that was being accomplished at the nearby Andre Agassi Boys
&amp; Girls Club.</TE>
<TE>   "The people at the club saw so much potential in the kids, they
wondered if we couldn't work with them more than a couple of hours a
day," said Julie Pippenger, executive director of the Andre Agassi
Charitable Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Pippenger and Perry Rogers, the foundation's president and
longtime Agassi friend, decided that a full-time school was the only
option.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people thought it was risky," Agassi said. "It was going
to be like riding your money on the blackjack table. You had to keep
putting money up there with the chance of losing everything."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he said, the decision was easy.</TE>
<TE>   "My question is, how can you not want to give back?" he said. "How
can you grow up and succeed and not want to share that success with
your community?"</TE>
<TE>   In February 2001, they took that risk, breaking ground at the same
time they were helping alter Nevada's charter school legislation to
allow them longer school days and a more flexible curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   The school was completed and opened a couple of weeks before the
Sept. 11 tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   On that day, Agassi made his first of several unannounced visits.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to see why we continue fighting," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When he comes to the school, often with wife Steffi Graf and their
son, he asks for no special privileges.</TE>
<TE>   They'll slip into the back of a class, watch for a few minutes,
sit with some of the kids at the computers, check out the artwork and
leave.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm there, it's like nothing I've ever felt in my life,"
Agassi said.</TE>
<TE>   There is a sign on the door of Agassi's gift.</TE>
<TE>   "Share the pride, step inside," it reads.</TE>
<TE>   A tiny step for many. A giant step for one.</TE>

<HD>Evans Won't Take Bait and Belt 'Swinging Friar'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Dodger General Manager Dan Evans was sitting in the stands behind
home plate at Qualcomm Stadium Monday night, maybe the last place I'd
ever expect to see a Dodger general manager sitting again.</LD>
<LD>   The previous Dodger Goof, Kevin Malone, sat there a year ago,
challenged a heckling Padre fan--Jim Esterbrooks--to a fight, and a
few days later was fired.</LD>
<LD>   Now, I swear I couldn't possibly make this up, but when I arrived
at the ballpark Tuesday I received word Evans had gotten into it with
"The Swinging Friar," the Padre mascot, while sitting in the same
place where Malone had lost it.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I stopped laughing, I realized what a big story this might
be. I was told Evans had become so upset with The Friar he had
complained to Padre management, making him the first GM in baseball
to achieve full-fledged tattler status. Once this came out, I could
see Fox entertaining the idea now of matching Tonya Harding against
the winner of the bout between The Tattler &amp; The Friar.</TE>
<TE>   As the story goes, Evans was on a cell phone talking about a
trade, and The Friar had just come down to the field level seats to
visit a youngster who had received a heart transplant. It'd be a
better story, of course, if Evans tripped The Friar as he made his
way down to visit the youngster with the heart transplant, but I've
never thought he was all that quick on his feet.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea what the general manager of the Dodgers looks
like," the Friar told me in an exclusive interview. "I noticed this
guy on a cell phone, who wasn't paying any attention to the game, so
I kind of nudged him to watch the game."</TE>
<TE>   I asked The Friar by any chance if his name was "Jim Esterbooks,"
but he said, "no, I'm Al."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN MALONE got upset he had yelled to Esterbrooks, "You want to
fight, mouth?" so I asked Al if Evans had called him, "mouth," or had
challenged him to fight. Before he answered, I reminded him this
might be his only chance to get it on with Tonya Harding, but he said
the guy with the cell phone had expressed no interest in duking it
out.</TE>
<TE>   Now The Friar does not speak when in full costume, so it wasn't
like he had brought up the names of Mike Trombley, James Baldwin or
Terry Mulholland with Evans. So I wondered what had upset Evans so
much that he would be moved to become a tattletale.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know this is the first time you and I have talked to each
other, and it took divine intervention in the form of The Friar,"
Evans said, and I had no idea the Dodgers employed executives with a
sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked him what deal he was working on when interrupted by
The Friar, Evans said, "How do you know I was talking about a trade?
Maybe I was checking my voice mail for your call, or checking in with
99."</TE>
<TE>   Now I'm used to Dodger executives saying things and then having no
idea what they're talking about, so I had to ask for clarification:
"99?"</TE>
<TE>   "You know, agent 99," said Evans. "Get Smart."</TE>
<TE>   Get a third baseman who can hit, I thought, but I kept that to
myself and asked why he would put himself in the same position as
Malone--given the history in this place?</TE>
<TE>   "That has nothing to do with me; I've sat in the stands all year.
There really wasn't any incident with the mascot; I just wanted to be
able to watch the game, and once he moved there was no issue."</TE>
<TE>   Then he couldn't help himself, once more going David Letterman on
me: "I'm a Catholic, so it's not like I could just tell a Friar to
get lost."</TE>
<TE>   I have to give the Dodgers credit, no matter who they have working
as GM, they keep me laughing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHO SAYS Dodger general managers are incapable of learning on the
job? On Tuesday night Evans' seat behind home plate remained empty.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON SUNDAY the Dodgers conducted Autograph Day outside Dodger
Stadium, and left a line stretching around the stadium full of kids
disappointed after not getting to one of the players before the
session was called off.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a group of about 25 or 30 there for a birthday party, and
we were in line for about an hour and came within eight or 10 feet of
Andy Ashby when the players left," said Kevin Kratzer, who e-mailed
both The Times and the Dodgers to express disappointment on behalf of
his 5- and 12-year-old sons. "Nobody in the line behind us knew what
was going on and were still standing there waiting to get an
autograph in the hot sun, and the players were already gone. It just
wasn't handled well."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers did not respond to Kratzer's e-mail, but when I
contacted Derrick Hall, the Dodgers' VP for making things right, he
agreed with Kratzer.</TE>
<TE>   "By design, every child under 14 years of age should get an
autograph," Hall said. "We should have a stack of autographs to hand
out if something like this happens. We do three of these Autograph
Days, and divide the team into thirds so players have to do this only
once ..."</TE>
<TE>   I certainly wouldn't want a major league baseball player to
surrender an hour of his time twice a season to give autographs.</TE>
<TE>   "It just doesn't make sense to disappoint future Dodger fans,"
Kratzer said.</TE>
<TE>   I can't tell you how long Kevin Brown has had me waiting for his
autograph.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Michael Axelrod:</TE>
<TE>   "I've noticed when you write about the Chargers your columns are
insightful and very funny. However, when writing about the Dodgers
you come across as mean-spirited and vindictive. Why do you think
this is?''</TE>
<TE>   Because you're a Dodger fan?</TE>

<LD>The Dodgers will take advantage of off days Thursday and Monday and
skip Odalis Perez's next start in the rotation, in hopes that nine
days between games will refresh the fatigued left-hander.</LD>
<LD>   Perez, 23, has thrown 144 1/3 innings this season, 49 more than he
has thrown in any of his three previous big league seasons, and he
appeared to hit a wall in late June.</LD>
<LD>   After going 9-3 with a 2.33 earned-run average in his first 16
games, Perez has gone 1-4 with a 7.31 ERA in his last five starts,
giving up 23 earned runs on 41 hits in 28 1/3 innings. He was hit
hard in Monday night's 5-2 loss to the Padres, giving up three earned
runs on eight hits, five for extra bases, in five innings.</LD>
<TE>   "He's way out beyond anywhere he's gone as far as innings
pitched," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "He's 23, he's in
unchartered waters, and he also had a Tommy John [arm] surgery [in
2000]. This is the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   After Kazuhisa Ishii pitches today's series finale against San
Diego, Hideo Nomo, Omar Daal and Andy Ashby will pitch this weekend
in San Francisco. Ishii, Nomo and Perez (on Aug. 1) will start in
Cincinnati next Tuesday through Thursday.</TE>

<TE>   Darren Dreifort's scheduled three-inning simulated game was
canceled Tuesday because the right-hander, who is recovering from
major elbow surgery, has a sore right knee, an injury that will push
back his anticipated minor league rehabilitation assignment
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Dreifort will return to Los Angeles today to be examined by Dr.
Frank Jobe, Dodger team physician, and he will likely undergo an MRI
test. Trainer Stan Johnston said the injury was sustained over a
period of time and not the result of a recent trauma. Dreifort was
able to throw lightly in the bullpen Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be nothing, it could be something, we'll wait and see,"
Dreifort said. "If it was serious, I wouldn't be walking, so I'm not
overly concerned."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, the No. 2 batter in Tracy's
original lineup Tuesday night, was scratched because of a strained
lower back, an injury he sustained while ranging far behind the
second base bag to field a grounder and make an off-balance throw to
first in the fifth inning Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, who has nine hits in his last 18 at-bats, underwent
several hours of treatment and was given muscle relaxants. He said it
was a little more serious than the back injury that plagued him
earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely tweaked it or pulled it a little more," Grudzielanek
said. "I couldn't sleep much [Monday] night. This couldn't have come
at a worse time."</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek will be re-evaluated today but is doubtful for the
series finale.</TE>
