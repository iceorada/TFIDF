<LD>Five men in suits and tuxedos move among the green felt tables at the
Magic Castle's Inner Circle Ballroom in L.A., where posters of
magicians, past and present, line the wall. "Watch this," says Brian
Ochab, a 34-year-old actor from Detroit as he performs a
sleight-of-hand trick in which a card travels from his hand to end up
inside a tiny box on the bar, outside his reach. As the box is opened
to reveal his folded card inside, the audience gasps and Ochab takes
a bow.</LD>
<LD>   Nearby, an older magician in a black velvet jacket makes a crystal
ball disappear into a handkerchief, while David Shimshi, a younger
magician, flamboyantly spins cards in twirls around his body without
touching them.</LD>
<LD>   On this Wednesday evening, the magicians compete in the "Strolling
Olympics," a competitive event in which performers are judged by a
panel of their peers. Organizers from the Academy of Magical Arts
envision it as the equivalent of stand-up comedy at the Improv.</LD>
<TE>   The magicians run the gamut from purists--close-up magicians who
perform card tricks--to hyphenated performers such as Hillel Gitter,
a self-described "clown- tomime" whose performance includes "acts of
mime, clowning and magic." This evening, Gitter, whose long, curly
gray hair flows to the shoulders of his powder-blue jacket, is not
performing but judging the competition. He is impressed by the
talent, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Around 9 p.m., the contest wraps up, and judges confer, counting
their ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Shimshi wins the competition, carrying home a trophy created
especially for the occasion and a check for $50.</TE>
<TE>   After the competition, Ochab explains that he was drawn to magic
when he met a magician on a movie set where he was working as an
extra. As he got to know the magic community in Los Angeles, "I was
surprised to see there were so many young magicians," says Ochab.
There is a "hipness to [magic] that wasn't there before," says Ochab.
"We've moved past the old idea of the bad tux and the bad jokes."</TE>
<TE>   In the library, which only practicing magicians can enter,
librarian Gordon Bean sits behind a desk topped by a skull, a couple
of reference books and several decks of playing cards. "Magic is
poetry," he says. "Close-up [magic] is haiku."</TE>
<TE>   Making people believe in illusions is indeed magic, adds Bean,
"particularly in this town, where people think they've seen
everything."</TE>

<TE>   The Secret to His Success</TE>
<TE>   Writer John Ridley stands on the Universal Studios lot, taking a
minute for a cell phone chat about his concept of success, which
seems to have a lot to do with sheer persistence.</TE>
<TE>   It's Thursday morning and he says he's operating on about three
hours of sleep, up late and out early working on one of the three new
pilots he penned for next season. At this moment, he's still buzzing
from a pitch meeting with a producer. It went well and Ridley's
upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   After this phone call, he's headed to his publicist's office to
talk about his fifth book, "Conversation With a Mann" (Warner Books)
due out in six weeks. The book debuts days after the May 31 release
of his new film "Undercover Brother," a 1970s-style action-comedy
starring Eddie Griffin and Denise Richards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not always like this," Ridley says of the hectic pace,
during the phone interview. "It's just a busy time of year."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley, 35, is a former stand-up comic who got his start in
Hollywood in the early 1990s as a TV writer. Over the years, he
earned a reputation for dark and violent stories laced with comedy,
and he has ridden out the vicissitudes of Hollywood. He wrote the
original screenplay for 1999's "Three Kings," but divorced himself
from the project when the lead character was changed from a black man
to a white man and ultimately received "story by" credit.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley's current pilots show his range. For ABC/Touchstone
Television, he's written a show about two children whose parents are
part of an ancient clan of warriors battling evil. He's also doing a
half-hour comedy, sans warriors, loosely based on his relationship
with his wife, Gayle. His third pilot, for UPN, is an hourlong drama
about two brothers and their struggling hip-hop record label.</TE>
<TE>   "I come up with an idea, pitch it as a movie first, then a TV
show, then a book," he says. The successful concepts are always "the
idea that nobody wants in the first place. Then, you do it once, in
one format, and everybody wants it."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Ridley is eager to talk about his new book, the story of a
Harlem-born comic in the 1950s determined to become the first black
stand-up comic to appear on TV's "Ed Sullivan Show." It's a book, he
says, that incorporates almost everything he has learned from working
in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   That lesson: "You can't allow other people to set your standard
for success."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sightings:</TE>
<TE>   At a book party for Paul Jasmin at Les Deux Cafe in Hollywood last
week, celebrities flocked to toast the photographer who makes them
look so good. (Jasmin also had a stint in the movies as the voice of
Norman Bates' mother in "Psycho.")</TE>
<TE>   Among those celebrating the publication of Jasmin's book,
"Hollywood Cowboy," were Christina Ricci, Sofia Coppola and her
husband, director Spike Jonze, Kelly Lynch, Cameron Diaz, Daryl
Hannah and artist Robert Graham.</TE>

<LD>Did you know that the bones in prehistoric animal skeletons you see
at museums are not always from the same animal? Paleontologists often
use a combination of bones from different animals to create a
complete skeleton.</LD>
<LD>   When paleontologists go on fossil digs, they seldom find the
complete skeleton of a dinosaur in one place. Instead they may find
partial skeletons in the same area. In order to rebuild and display a
complete dinosaur, scientists combine the bones from many different
animals into one skeleton for display.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes missing bones are never found. To create a complete
skeleton for display in a museum, scientists often have to fill in
the missing pieces. They work with other scientists to obtain these
bones, or they use research and scientific knowledge to complete the
skeletons. They do this by creating replacement bones from plaster.</LD>
<TE>   Some rare and delicate bones are used strictly for research and
cannot be put on display. Instead substitute bones are created from
plaster molds for display.</TE>
<TE>   At the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Claremont, the
Allosaurus skeleton is actually a cast from the bones of five partial
skeletons uncovered at a single quarry in central Utah. When this
dinosaur was discovered, it had vertebrae different from any other
known dinosaur, so it was named Allosaurus, or "different lizard."</TE>

<DH>Eugenia Kim's daring hats have a passionate following.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRONWYN GARRITY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eugenia Kim sips chardonnay by the window in the lounge at the Hotel
Casa Del Mar in Santa Monica. It's drizzling this afternoon, but the
view is quintessential L.A: endless blond sand, blue ocean and
desolate pier with its lights blinking into the wet haze. Kim,
wearing a saucer-sized red beret to one side of her bleached bob,
says the scene reminds her of "The Great Gatsby" and lights a
cigarette, looking for a moment like one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's
creations.</LD>
<LD>   If, as the author wrote, "personality is an unbroken series of
successful gestures," then Kim has struck out. Two astonished
employees, who spot her lighting up, sweep her out the doors. By the
time she reenters, she has become The Smoker. As she refastens her
mini-beret to her now damp bleached bob, Kim notices that people in
the lobby are watching her with curiosity. A front desk attendant
roots through a drawer and proffers a cigarette of his own. Dropping
the donation into her pocket, she returns to her table, an accidental
criminal. Or a brand-new celebrity.</LD>
<TE>   She's quitting soon, she says, but a law against smoking? "Where
am I?" Kim, the 28-year old, Korean American "It girl" of millinery,
is described as a "genius" and affectionately, as a "basket case" by
those who know her. Sarah Brown, Vogue's beauty editor, who met Kim
during their summer together at the Radcliffe Publishing Course,
admits that "when people meet Eugenia for the first time, it isn't
always apparent how smart she is. She seems whimsical and nutty. But,
she's drawing on a wealth of literary and cultural influences."</TE>
<TE>   The oldest daughter of Korean immigrants, Kim grew up in
Pittsburgh and attended Dartmouth, where she took premed classes and
was infamous for wearing hot pink instead of the Ivy League uniform
of preppy pullovers and duck boots. Much to her parents' chagrin, Kim
switched her major to psychology and later decided to become a
literary editor.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, she attended the prestigious five-week Radcliffe
Publishing Course, where students make connections and enjoy "sherry
hour" with some of the biggest figures in the industry. After
arriving in New York, Kim landed a job at Conde Nast, publisher of
Vogue, Glamour and other magazines as a "rover"--assisting at any
publication that needed her. She was fired, however, for "being
disorganized," and, say Conde Nast insiders, "for leaving the office
at all times for sample sales."</TE>
<TE>   Kim's stint at Conde Nast instilled in her, if not order, at least
an unquenchable interest in fashion. Then 23, she enrolled in a hat
design course at Parsons School of Design in Manhattan and poured her
energy into creating. "There were hat farms all over our apartment,"
recalls her then-roommate, Ava Scanlon. "We were finally kicked out
because she was spray-sizing in the apartment, in the halls, outside,
everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   That first year, Kim had a taste of success, albeit one with no
commercial value. "She was spray-painting Mohawk headbands," Scanlon
says, "ugly, fluorescent orange things, and Gen Art [a collective of
young artists] displayed them even though no one wanted to buy them."
Putting that look behind her, Kim, who describes herself as obsessive
and compulsive, knew when she was onto something with a new design
when she wore it on the street and people stopped her to ask where
she'd bought the hat. That year, 1997, she founded her eponymous
design firm, which now sells to stores in Tokyo, Paris and London.</TE>
<TE>   These days, magazine editors, celebrity stylists and Hollywood
stars count themselves among her fans. Jennifer Lopez, Nicole Kidman,
Alicia Keys, Jennifer Connelly, Cuba Gooding, Janet Jackson and Dave
Mathews have been glimpsed in Kim's classic cloches, soft leather
newsboys or eccentric fedoras. Yunnie Kim, the owner of Fred Segal
Tiara, Santa Monica, calls the hats "special pieces that sell to a
special clientele." Though Tiara is a jewelry store, people come for
the hats, often purchasing three or four at a time, for $75 to $1,100
a piece. "</TE>
<TE>   Now 28, and an established designer, Kim has discovered her
biggest fans in Los Angeles. This year, she says, L.A. shoppers have
bought her hats at nearly three times the rate in New York,
previously her largest market. L.A. boutiques such Fred Segal Tiara,
Curve and Diavolina have increased orders, particularly of the silk
newsboys and straw sun hats.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, you feel like a wacko wearing a hat in L.A," says
Sarah Stewart, women's buyer of Maxfield, who recently placed the
store's first order with Kim. "That's why people here like the
newsboy. It's casual and cool." Donna Nunley, a sales associate at
Curve says that the straw hats and newsboy caps sold as soon as they
hit shelves. "They [customers] hear we're carrying Eugenia Kim hats
and they come in--just for that."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, Kim's work has been sought for runway shows
by designers, including Donna Karan, Cynthia Rowley, Catherine
Malandrino, Alice Roi and Alvin Valley, among others. Roi says Kim is
extremely creative and hard-working. Valley calls her pieces
"classic, elegant, urban, edgy."</TE>
<TE>   Much of her work evokes a classic 1920s spirit. Kim admits that
the reference is intentional. "I admire that era because it was a
really feminist time," she says. "Women had a lot more freedom,
intellectually and otherwise," than they'd ever experienced before.
They won the right to vote and became more active, playing golf and
tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Hats, without which a lady didn't dare go out, adapted
accordingly. Wide brims were pulled in tighter, the fabric softened,
and the decorations grew subtler and less ornate. Or, as Kim says:
"Twenties hats were more beautiful, flattering and less encumbering
than the heavy ones of the Victorian era."</TE>
<TE>   Kim also believes that the '20s resonate with her generation. The
young people of World War I experienced conflicting feelings of
disillusionment, self-indulgence, moral reevaluation and especially,
hope. The time held, as Fitzgerald wrote, "all the iridescence of the
beginning of the world."</TE>
<TE>   The designer recalls feeling a similar range of emotions in the
wake of Sept. 11. "I started thinking about my role in society--I was
feeling useless--and I watched the people in my shop, and I realized
that hats make people happy, and that's important right now. Hats are
about fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   She recently created a whole collection of hats based on Gatsby's
fictional borough, West Egg. She inscribed text on a ribbon
encircling the hats' crowns. "Whatever shall we do this afternoon?"
reads one in old-fashioned courier font. One leather cloche is cut to
look like traditional flapper hair, with yolk-like yellow and white
dripping over the edge of one cheek--a playful presentation of West
Egg.</TE>
<TE>   Emma Forrest, a British novelist and owner of several Eugenia Kim
originals, says she loves the "mad, genuinely inspiring" hats Kim
spins out. "I imagine her ideas as curly," Forrest says, "and coming
directly out of the top of her head into these big, crazy hats." Kim,
who recognized the name on Forrest's credit card when the author
shopped at her store, ultimately asked Forrest to collaborate on a
project that would wrap her words around beaver felt fedoras.</TE>
<TE>   "I had sex with my roommate's boyfriend against the wall outside
her bedroom ... I refused to take my hat off," reads the bestselling
hat of the bunch, penned in graffiti by Forrest--on a flattened
snake. "It looks like a ribbon," Kim says of the snake. "It isn't at
all gruesome. In fact, Nicole Kidman bought one without the
graffiti."</TE>
<TE>   Now she is offering a number of beaver and felt cloches with black
leather ruching and--take a deep breath--a white mink's head with a
tiny red bow near its ear. "Cute!" exclaimed one retailer when she
spied the hat at an April trade show at downtown's New Mart.</TE>
<TE>   Kim's most expensive hats literally make use of whole animals.
"Utilizing a fox's entire head, with legs on one side and tail on the
other," Kim says. "I eliminate a lot of waste. No one uses these
parts, and I don't like that they're thrown away." Where would such a
thing sell? "They love it in Japan."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Kim discovered in a Manhattan vintage store some
preserved beetles from the 1920s. Sealing them in a glaze of
polyurethane, she fastened the bugs to hats last fall. This spring,
the bugs are woman-made.</TE>
<TE>   This grande modiste's personal favorite? A hat based on Sanrio's
"Hello Kitty," constructed of white felt, black leather whiskers and
topped with a red silk bow. (The face is set on the wearer's head at
an angle.) Though Sanrio's image is often derided as
misogynistic--the female cat has no mouth--Kim considers the
character "the ultimate, Asian feminist."</TE>
<TE>   For her, the cat's power is passive aggressive: "'I'm going to get
what I want through feminine wiles,' which is what, of course, a cat
is," she explains. "I'm not saying it's right. But, it's power, and a
lot of women do it." Kim loves the design because it is a perfect
circle, because it looks a bit like her logo, and because "it makes
everyone who sees it happy."</TE>
<TE>   How could it be that Angelenos, known for their sun worshipping,
are leading the hat pack? "A hat is drama," Kim says. "Everybody
wants to be the life of the party sometimes." Maybe we're all a
little bit like, "Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, [who] sprang
from his Platonic conception of himself."</TE>

<HD>His News Will Be Fit to Print, Says Riordan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 72, Richard Riordan still sends guys half his age home with
bruises from the Saturday-morning basketball games he plays at Venice
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Now the former L.A. mayor would like to bloody The Times' nose by
starting a newspaper "that wants its readers to fall in love with Los
Angeles."</LD>
<LD>   "This town needs a paper that has an intellectually honest
perspective on local news and respects its readers," said Riordan,
who unsuccessfully sought the GOP's nomination in last month's
gubernatorial primary and believes neither that campaign nor his
mayoral administration received fair or accurate coverage from The
Times. "I don't think any paper should have a monopoly, and The Times
has a death wish for Los Angeles," he said. "It would like to see the
city destroyed, and 99% of the local news it prints is negative, and
that hurts the city.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not suggesting that The Times ought to engage in boosterism
or dishonest reporting," said the lawyer and venture capitalist,
whose personal worth is thought to exceed $100 million. "I'm just
against the paper's intellectual dishonesty and political
correctness."</TE>
<TE>   What Riordan envisions for his own paper is something modeled on
the New York Observer, a blend of columns, local news, reviews and
analysis. He plans to act as editor in chief and currently is meeting
with candidates for the managing editor's job, some of whom "we've
flown in from out of town."</TE>
<TE>   According to Riordan, he is conducting "meetings every day" on the
project, which he hopes to launch as a five-day-a-week broadsheet,
"though it could be once or twice a week."</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to use a lot of features by freelancers," Riordan
said. "There are so many good writers in Los Angeles, particularly in
the movie industry, and many of them would work for low rates to see
their stuff in print. On the economic side, we're going to try not to
have too many full-time people--probably about 40. We'll have a lot
of columns, local news, quality gossip, film history, a page on
what's good and bad on the Internet and short movie reviews that
people can understand and that don't give the plot away."</TE>
<TE>   One of the columnists Riordan already has approached is retired
Times City Editor Bill Boyarsky, whose column The Spin was widely
read by local politicos. However, Boyarsky, who teaches political
science at USC and works at the Center for Governmental Studies
there, said he was too busy to do more than contribute occasional
articles.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he will put up part of the estimated $5 million
analysts say will be required to launch the new paper, though he said
"several people have come to me already about investing." (The
recently launched New York Sun, a culturally and politically
conservative five-day-a-week broadsheet, raised $20 million,
including a substantial investment by Canadian-born financier Conrad
Black.)</TE>
<TE>   One name investment bankers have linked with Riordan's project is
Rupert Murdoch, whose extensive local holdings include Fox Studios
and Broadcasting as well as the Dodgers. Riordan declined to discuss
Murdoch or any other potential investor by name.</TE>
<TE>   Asked where he would seek readers for the paper he hopes to put on
newsstands by September, Riordan said he had been advised "to stand
on the highest point in Pacific Palisades and to go after everybody I
could see from that point."</TE>
<TE>   Pollster and political strategist Arnold Steinberg, a longtime
Riordan advisor who resigned from the gubernatorial campaign over
strategic differences, said, "No one should underestimate Dick. He
can call upon a vast network of social and business relationships to
help him succeed.... But he could hurt himself and the newspaper by
dominating editorial policy. People have to feel that this newspaper
will take on sacred cows. That's tough, because Dick is so terribly
well connected that good stories are likely to offend some of his
friends. This cannot be a paper for Westside Hollywood liberals who
don't like The Times' movie reviews."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vanity Press?</TE>
<TE>   "Only the written word endures," wrote the wishful Latin poet
Horace.</TE>
<TE>   But writers and editors know that paper is a fragile thing. Hence
their frequent efforts to extend its shelf life--and
profitability--by binding it between hard covers. Vanity Fair editor
Graydon Carter, for example, has revived efforts to create a
publishing imprint that would bear the perennially profitable Conde
Nast magazine's name but which would be distributed by an existing
publishing house.</TE>
<TE>   Carter already has held preliminary talks with Random House,
Knopf, Nicholas Calloway, Assouline and Talk Miramax. Carter was in
London this week "straightening out some problems with Vanity Fair's
British edition." But a spokeswoman explained that the magazine's
proposed imprint envisions producing a half-dozen or so titles over
four years. They would not be book-length expansions of the
magazine's feature articles but topical anthologies of articles as
published, as well as photographic collections from Vanity Fair's
archives. The latter would follow the path beaten to numerous coffee
tables by the magazine's recent collection of Hollywood photos.</TE>
<TE>   Carter expects to have a publishing deal by the fall and to launch
the imprint sometime next year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Novelist, screenwriter and critic David Freeman is author of "One
of Us" and "A Hollywood Education." His screenplays include "Street
Smart" and "The Border." Freeman says:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very near the end of a book, which I now believe is going to
be called 'It's All True.' It's the story of a man named--for the
moment, at least--Henry Wearie, who is a screenwriter. Through his
voice and experiences, the novel is a fictional history of Los
Angeles and Hollywood over the last 25 years. It's a period marked by
astonishing changes in the movie business and in the city. The movie
business is characterized by the change from independent production
companies to the utter lunacy of the multinationals. The changes in
Los Angeles are exemplified by the Farmers Market, where I, actually,
and Henry, fictionally, breakfast every morning and have for many
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Henry, I think, reflects the great middle among Hollywood
screenwriters. He had one sizable hit early on, a number of smaller
successes and a great many unmade scripts since. There's a bit of
movie business salami that rings in his mind: 'If you have a hit when
you're young, you'll never leave.'"</TE>

<HD>This Leggy Accessory Goes Out on a Limb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valli Herman-Cohen;Michael Quintanilla</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a little fashion sleight of hand, or rather, arm, that
appeared in the fall 2002 collection of Eisbar shown on the runway of
the Coalition of Los Angeles Designers show last week.</LD>
<LD>   The leg warmers that accessorized the new women's collection were
originally intended to be sleeves, said Eisbar co-founder Bobby
Benveniste, who said this week that he was inspired by a pile of
castoff jacket parts last season. The designers had converted men's
motorcycle jackets to vests, which left extra parts.</LD>
<LD>   "We had all these extra sleeves, and I thought, what are we going
to do with them?" he said. Voila! Leg warmers! "We don't want to call
them leg warmers, because people will be scared off by that. So we
named them cobertos, which means 'covers' in Portuguese."</LD>
<TE>   When worn over shoes, the suede, leather or denim cobertos look
like either tall spats, the shaft of boots, or a type of, yes, leg
warmer, but not a sleeve. "We wanted to do leg warmers anyway," said
co-designer Kiernan Lambeth. "It was sort of a happy accident."</TE>
<TE>   The look of spats and leg warmers has been brewing on the streets
of L.A. and will be featured in the fall collections of Chanel,
Marjan Pejoski and Guy Laroche, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Benveniste said he hopes that the new accessory will become an
inexpensive and unique drawing card for the rest of the women's line,
which debuts this fall.</TE>

<TE>   Dudes in Designer Duds</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, let's rewind to last week's fashion action at the
Millennium Biltmore Hotel, where local politicos--dudes in designer
duds--took to the catwalk for the Los Angeles Women's Foundation
fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Backstage, the likes of City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, Sheriff Lee
Baca and speaker emeritus of the California State Assembly Antonio
Villaraigosa chatted about Gucci, Armani and Zegna.</TE>
<TE>   Because he wears a uniform for work, Baca said, he appreciates
fine clothes and owns more than 20 suits "which tend to be charcoal,
black and gray in athletic cuts."</TE>
<TE>   "For me, style is about looking good in clothes that speak to your
height and weight. I wear clothes that are fashionably suited to my
size," he said, adding that he prefers European cuts, especially Yves
Saint Laurent. But he's not opposed to shopping for a bargain, as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "If I buy an off-brand label, I pay attention to the tailoring and
usually have the coat taken in on the sides. I go for a conservative
and balanced look, but with quality in mind," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa said his personal style is "somewhat relaxed, but if
I had a choice, it would be Armani suits. I love the way they hang on
the body." Delgadillo is a Donna Karan fan and is especially fond of
DKNY ties for his striped shirts. Gordon Davidson, artistic director
and producer of the Center Theatre Group, said his style is "very
mixed. Because I have to raise money, I'm in suits for the boardroom,
but when I'm with actors, I dress alternative."</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Richard Riordan said, "The sloppy square look is my
usual attire. I try to look like Clint Eastwood but always end up
looking like Adam Sandler."</TE>

<HD>Jean-eology Keeps Right On Evolving</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: Please explain why the rage in women's fashion
is to wear pants that look as if the occupant accidentally was
brushed by bleach. As a man, I can only shake my head when spotting
women dressed in this style, and point out that big blotches of white
around a gal's behind only serve to highlight it.</LD>
<LD>   Who came up with this ridiculous fashion, and why do women wear
it?</LD>
<LD>   --DON'T GET IT</LD>
<TE>   Dear Don't: There's a lot more going on here than just some funky
jeans. Your question brings up the issue of trends--how they get
started and why they catch on, as well as why people wear things that
are perceived by some as one notch below clown clothes. (And don't
forget, this isn't limited to women--men can go way off course, too.
Let's all think about those open-toed slide shoes for a moment.)</TE>
<TE>   The pants you started seeing last year are antique wash or vintage
wash jeans, called that because they're distressed to look old, with
lighter, worn patches usually on the thighs and backside. They might
be accented with "whiskers," so named because the creases that
normally form at the top of the leg are bleached out, giving the look
of animal whiskers when the wearer stands up.</TE>
<TE>   Bleaching or distressing jeans is nothing new and goes back some
40 years. The jean-eology also includes sandblasted, stonewashed, and
acid wash denim. We're not surprised to see the vintage look again,
since everything in fashion eventually comes back around for a
second, third or fourth incarnation. (So far there have been no
leisure suit sightings, but we're keeping an eye out.) But it's new
to the teens and 20-somethings who are the targeted demographic for
the style, and they love it. One reason it became a trend and found
success might be because it's a perfect complement to the peasant
blouses and prairie/western looks that abound--also retreads that
look fresh and new to this generation, which has put its own spin on
things.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that you think these jeans look goofy doesn't surprise
us. Men and women are forever shaking their heads at the clothes worn
by other generations. But let's not forget that fashion is often
about pushing the envelope. Although it's been pushed too far for
your taste in this instance, it's not going to stop.</TE>
<TE>   But don't worry; even though these vintage wash jeans have stuck
around for a while, they'll be replaced by something else in the
blink of an eye. Denim is such a wardrobe cornerstone and a malleable
yet sturdy fabric that designers are always doing something to it,
whether it's dyeing, ripping, cutting, studding, embroidering or
pounding it into near oblivion. Anything that can be done to jeans
will be. Stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: My parents are all, like, you can't get a
tattoo or like, another piercing until you're, like, in college! And
I was totally, like, that's not fair! What should I do?</TE>
<TE>   --LIKE, FRUSTRATED</TE>
<TE>   Dear Like: Like, grow up, move out of the house, and then you can
mark up your body however you, like, want! We're all, what's the
rush? And do you have to, like, do everything your friends do? Like,
don't be a sheep!</TE>
<TE>   As for the rest of you underage souls who are feuding with your
parents over the same thing, one piece of advice: Listen to them.
They've been on the planet a lot longer than you.</TE>

<LD>"I hate nature," my teenage niece once proclaimed. "Seen one tree,
you've seen them all."</LD>
<LD>   Hiking on my favorite trail in the Santa Monica Mountains, as I do
most weekends, I see more than trees. There are panoramic views of
the coastline and the Pacific's changing moods, a varying display of
wildflowers, even occasional celebrity sightings--Kate Capshaw,
Michael Crichton and Anthony Hopkins, among others, tackle the hilly
path a few canyons away from the Getty Museum. A sign at the trail
head warns against mountain lions and prohibits dogs, but lizards are
plentiful. I've seen snakes slithering out of the grass, and the
group of friends with whom I exercise are careful to warn other
hikers when a serpent has been spotted.</LD>
<LD>   On a recent Sunday morning, we'd walked for only a few minutes
when we suddenly stopped. Two rattlesnakes blocked our way. By
detouring slightly, we could have passed them, but in the time it
took us to debate a strategy, (better to sneak slowly or whiz by?) we
became entranced. The snakes were engaged in some sort of ritual. We
quickly sensed we were witnessing something extraordinary, a
spectacle none of us had ever encountered.</LD>
<TE>   The snakes, each about 3 feet long, rose up, perpendicular to the
ground. With a foot between them, they held their position, then, as
if on cue, pulled farther back, where they remained immobile for a
beat. Then they slammed together. They wriggled on the ground,
wrestling in the dust, then disengaged. Once again, they faced each
other, their linear bodies extended straight up. Separately, but as
precisely as synchronized swimmers, they carved a slalom pattern in
the air. Advancing and retreating, a crescendo of activity followed
by a period of rest, the serpentine ballet was so exquisitely
choreographed that "Bolero" might have been playing.</TE>
<TE>   As we watched, we assigned meaning to the snakes' darts and
feints. We crafted a narrative. The broader snake was a male. The
other, a female. They were mating, we decided. The sensuality of
their instinctual movements, the way they teased each other and
collided with what seemed to be passion wasn't that different from
human sexuality. How interesting, we thought, that this simpler
species flirted, that they were as playful and seductive as if they
were a man and a woman in Eden.</TE>
<TE>   Interesting, but wrong. "What you saw was a combat dance," Russ
Smith, curator of reptiles at the Los Angeles Zoo, tells me. "It was
two males in a territorial spat, or they were struggling to decide
who would get to breed a female in the area. In most cases, it's a
prelude to mating. It's a competition thing in which the stronger
male wins out. The weaker one isn't hurt, other than his pride."</TE>
<TE>   Smith assures me that the combat dance is much more dramatic than
reptiles copulating. "Consider yourself lucky," he says. "I've been
hiking in this area for years, and I've never seen it out in the
wild. We know it happens, and we've all seen photographs of it. I've
seen reptiles mating outside the zoo, but I've never run across a
combat dance."</TE>
<TE>   People pay thousands of dollars and travel great distances to go
on safari to observe exotic animals in their native habitat. Close to
home, in a city known more for its urban sophistication than its
natural wonders, we lucked into a Discovery Channel dream. Fault us
for having sex on the brain, for being so narcissistic that we
likened animal behavior to that of amorous humans. But before we
began to analyze and misinterpret, we watched in silence, knowing we
were in the presence of something rare and beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   There is no way to estimate the number of rattlesnakes in the
foothills around Los Angeles, but it's a sure bet that any found in
this area are of the family Crotalidae. "People say they've seen
diamondbacks in Los Angeles, but that's impossible," Smith says. "All
we find around here are southern Pacific rattlers."</TE>
<TE>   The combat dance of the Crotalus viridis helleri, or southern
Pacific rattlesnake, can last half an hour, till one of the warriors
tires and slinks away. We lingered for at least 10 minutes, alerting
advancing hikers of what lay ahead. Most were too afraid to look, an
unfortunate and unwarranted reaction, according to the reptile
expert.</TE>
<TE>   "Rattlesnakes aren't aggressors," Smith says. "There are about 17
fatalities from rattlesnake bites in the U.S. each year, but most of
the people who are bitten are trying to catch or kill the snakes. A
large percentage are young men between 18 and 25, and when the
incidents are investigated, it's found there's often alcohol
involved. How badly someone is poisoned will depend on the size of
the snake. The majority of adults will survive a rattlesnake bite
without much problem. The situation is more serious with children.
The main thing is to get medical attention as quickly as possible."</TE>
<TE>   If we had interrupted the snakes' macho posturing, the rattlers
would have gone into hiding, not attacked. A snake will only bite and
inject venom if it's cornered or harassed. It saves its poison for
defense and can inflict venomless bites in less threatening
situations.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, a rattlesnake's first reaction will be to lie perfectly
still and hope you won't see him. The rattle on their tail is a
warning device for larger animals, signaling them not to step on the
snake. A lot of harmless snakes will vibrate their tails, as a
nervous reaction to a threat. Most problems develop when people mess
with the snakes."</TE>
<TE>   From the time they're 2 or 3 years old, snakes mate in the spring
and six months later give birth to litters of eight. In captivity,
rattlesnakes live more than 20 years. In the wild, they have to hunt
for food and resist predators. Red tail hawks, coyotes, mountain
lions and bobcats prey on rattlers. When the surviving snakes of the
Santa Monica Mountains pick up the scent of an ovulating female
snake, they will combat dance again, but it's unlikely we'll ever
catch them at it. Their shows aren't scheduled for sightseers, which
is why there aren't a lot of people who can say, "Seen one combat
dance, seen them all."</TE>

<LD>Maria and her younger brother Alfonso are on a day trip with their
Uncle Ruben, who is a nature guide. They are crawling around on the
ground inside a domed, grass-covered shelter.</LD>
<LD>   "Did the Indians really live in houses like these, Uncle Ruben?"
Maria asked.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, Maria," Uncle Ruben said. "This is the type of home that
Native Americans lived in. It's a large, half-dome structure, covered
with thick bundles of cattail grass."</LD>
<TE>   "This is better than my fort in the backyard," Alfonso said
excitedly. It was dark and cool inside the grass hut.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the kitchen?" Maria asked with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "It's right here," Uncle Ruben responded, pointing to the circle
of stones in the middle of the shelter. "Remember how I showed you
that people often cooked by putting their food directly on rocks such
as these?"</TE>
<TE>   "Ugh," Maria said.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's do it," Alfonso yelled.</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't you get all dirty living in a house like this?" Maria
asked, turning up her nose.</TE>
<TE>   "Not really," Uncle Ruben said. "One learns how to live outdoors.
Would you like to see how Native Americans made their soap?"</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso and Maria sat up straight, "Yes!" they said.</TE>
<TE>   They got out of the shelter and Uncle Ruben led them to a large
yucca plant, which had long pointy leaves that were very sharp.</TE>
<TE>   "Be careful," he warn-</TE>
<TE>   ed the children. He care-</TE>
<TE>   fully cut off a few of the lower leaves. "See how strong they
are?" He demonstrated, trying unsuccessfully to break the leaf.
"Let's go to the stream."</TE>
<TE>   At the stream, Uncle Ruben told Alfonso and Maria to shred the
yucca leaf into threads. They all dipped their yucca threads into the
water and rubbed them together between their hands. A thick frothy
soap resulted.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," Alfonso yelled, delighted with this new discovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, we'll never get dirty again," Maria said.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben just smiled.</TE>

<HD>They're Disrobing and Disarming</HD>
<DH>A new national touring version of 'The Full Monty' is
witty, though it has its flat moments. Ultimately, it's difficult to
resist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pity "The Full Monty." A slam-dunk musical sensation based on a
sleeper hit of a movie goes to Broadway, but a funny thing happens on
the way to "It" status: Mel Brooks' "The Producers" steals all of the
Tonys and then, to add insult to injury, an even more eye-opening
commedia dell' genitalia opens in New York, not so humbly called
"Puppetry of the Penis."</LD>
<LD>   If "Puppetry of the Penis" opened across the street from
Giordano's, the Chippendales-like club in Buffalo that serves as the
setting for the Americanized musical of "The Full Monty," which show
would the ladies select? Probably the puppets, at least for some
variety, but let's suspend disbelief: Let's pretend that it's
present-day Buffalo and there is only beefcake in leather G-strings
to choose from.</LD>
<LD>   It is this time and space--upstate New York, neglected urban core,
a place of malls, steel girders and no viable prospects--that is
presented by "The Full Monty," which opened Wednesday night at the
Ahmanson Theatre. This is a new national touring production of a show
that is proving itself a durable franchise; after debuting two years
ago at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, the show is still going on
Broadway and has opened in London, among other international markets.</LD>
<TE>   The saga of six unemployed steel mill workers who decide to strip
for cash and, as it turns out, even more-needed self-worth, "The Full
Monty" has been moved from its cinematic home, Sheffield, England;
instead of pints, guys talk about the football Bills.</TE>
<TE>   Despite jokes you can see coming from Ithaca and an opening 20
minutes that feel awfully sluggish and expository, "The Full Monty"
is nevertheless difficult to resist in the end. The sets are clever
and streamlined, the pacing spry. The talented core cast, under the
direction of Jack O'Brien and choreographer Jerry Mitchell, nicely
moves from disparate strangers to a unified band of reluctant
strippers.</TE>
<TE>   Audiences, to be sure, walk into this nearly three-hour show with
a working definition of what's in store. This is perhaps no surprise,
given that the 1997 movie was, in the words of President Bush, "a
uniter, not a divider," drawing in art-house snobs and people who
generally don't go to foreign movies, fearing they will have to read.</TE>
<TE>   There was a dark story of male aggression and desperation there,
but the movie turned the socioeconomics of its setting into comedy
with a bite.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Searchlight, which was behind the movie, had every reason to
believe the story would work as fodder for musical theater. And the
same unambiguous, plucky appeal that made the movie a hit pervades
the musical, augmented by a Terrence McNally book that is
well-structured and often witty but also stretches into polemics and,
at times, surprisingly flat exposition. The score, by David Yazbek,
is a more consistent pleasure, imbuing the show with wit and heart.</TE>
<TE>   Our six protagonists are led by deadbeat-ish but big-hearted dad
Jerry Lukowski (Christian Anderson). Desperate to raise the money
needed to pay his child support, Jerry alights upon the idea of
forming an all-male revue of local guys for a one-night-only
performance, a misadventure in which he's joined initially by his
overweight pal Dave (Michael Todaro).</TE>
<TE>   As Jerry, Anderson gives a somewhat pinched performance (you can
hear him clearly enough but can't sense who he is), though the show
really isn't about emotional heavy lifting, and it's easy enough to
intuit Jerry's anger and immaturity. Todaro as Dave is an amiable
sidekick, nimbly underselling his character's hapless self-loathing.</TE>
<TE>   If the show is a bit flat at the outset, when just the two of them
are onstage, the cavalry arrives soon enough. Cleavant Derricks as
Noah "Horse" T. Simmons makes the most of "Big Black Man," which
spoofs, well, a certain form of envy.</TE>
<TE>   While "The Full Monty" is a guy thing, the most consistent and
dynamic moments of comic relief come from two female characters set
up for just this purpose: Heidi Blickenstaff as Vicki Nichols,
hyperventilating wife of laid-off company man Harold Nichols, and
Carol Woods as Jeanette Burmeister, who shows up in "The Full Monty"
as if special-ordered from Central Casting.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanette, ostensibly, arrives as the accompanist for the guys as
they rehearse their dance act. But her role is really more of a
seen-it-all show-biz commentator, armed with zingers. "If you want to
be in show business, you should be spayed first," Jeanette says at
one point. Sing it, sister.</TE>
<TE>   And Woods does sing, kicking off Act 2 with "Jeanette's Showbiz
Number." By then, Yazbek's music has probably already won you over.
In the film of "The Full Monty," 1970s disco provided a comedic
counterpoint to the losing war the characters were waging against
their machismo (the film's standout moment coming when the guys are
in the unemployment line, cryptically gyrating despite themselves to
the strains of Donna Summer's "Hot Stuff").</TE>
<TE>   McNally tries to replicate this moment with a funeral scene, but
it seems forced and, ultimately, not entirely necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Yazbek's score, meanwhile, is no homage to disco; lyrically, it's
a riff on contemporary guy culture, with music that never strains to
be overtly memorable or bombastic. Hired to write the music for "The
Full Monty" after amassing an eclectic resume (he's formed his own
bands, has producing credits for the pop band XTC and spent a year as
a writer for David Letterman), Yazbek brings to "The Full Monty" a
light comic touch.</TE>
<TE>   Most winning are a number in which Jerry and Dave play around with
different ways to help would-be suicide victim Malcolm (Geoffrey
Nauffts) off himself, and "Michael Jordan's Ball," in which the guys
mimic basketball moves as means of exploring their less masculine,
hoofer sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Let It Go," the striptease number that closes the show, leads up
to the will-they-or-won't-they issue that gives the story its central
gimmick. Except it's not all that climactic; in fact, the moment of
truth arrives almost as a throwaway, an obligatory piece of business
for which audience participation is enlisted, the stripping version
of karaoke.</TE>
<TE>   By then, "The Full Monty," is running on goodwill, not tension.
The big moment arrives, sort of, but is that all you people can think
about?</TE>

<LD>No one waited for the morning paper when seeking early details about
Tuesday morning's crash in which a mile-long freight train ran
through two warning lights and slammed head-on into a Metrolink
commuter train.</LD>
<LD>   Television was the logical choice, of course, as Los Angeles
stations and 24-hour news networks moved swiftly to offer instant
sound bites and striking pictures of a rail debacle so deadly that
the collision site in Placentia resembled a combat zone.</LD>
<LD>   It was signature live coverage from a news medium that speeds from
one deafening boom to the next. That is not only helpful at times,
but worthy of praise.</LD>
<TE>   Yet TV news is also the caboose on its own runaway freight train
of action and violence, one doomed by its own devices, unfortunately,
never to catch up or see beyond the next blind curve. It's usually
first to arrive and react. When it comes to providing context and
locating connections that enhance understanding, though, it's pretty
much a dismal flop.</TE>
<TE>   That's the case now, as it was a decade ago during the Los Angeles
riots.</TE>
<TE>   They erupted after a Simi Valley jury acquitted four white LAPD
officers in the beating of African American motorist Rodney King,
despite videotape of him being thrashed savagely as he lay on the
ground. King had been drunk and speeding in a residential area when
finally pulled over. He was no angel, but in the minds of many Los
Angelenos, even less so were the cops who walloped him like a pinata
or did nothing to stop the beating that night while being secretly
taped by a nearby resident with a minicam.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder the verdicts were greeted by outrage in parts of the
city, exploding like a Molotov cocktail and touching off an urban
inferno.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the riots were the best of times for local
stations--a story of broken windows and heads they could zoom to
instinctively, with cameras rolling. If not for Bob Tur reporting
live for KCOP from his chopper above turbulent Florence and Normandie
in South-Central L.A., for example, Reginald O. Denny would probably
be dead today. Denny was the white trucker who had been pulled from
his vehicle by blacks and repeatedly kicked and smashed in the head
with a brick and other objects as he struggled in a daze to rise from
the pavement. Only after witnessing the attack on TV did four blacks
courageously speed to that intersection and rescue Denny from his
vicious assailants.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, it was the worst of times for local stations, as
they wandered like mindless "Night of the Living Dead" zombies
through one column of smoke after another, one looting after another
and one chaotic hot spot after another, beaming back one live TV
picture after another.</TE>
<TE>   If Tur's chopper footage was Denny's savior, live knee-jerk
coverage also was a big chunk of the problem, as stations, after
talking nonstop legalese during the televised trial, went back to
doing what they always did.</TE>
<TE>   Chasing crime.</TE>
<TE>   Some history: The riots could not have come at a worse moment
media-wise, given the pitiful level of TV reportage here at the time,
in part because stations had responded to the recessionary soft
economy by replacing many seasoned reporters with lower-paid green
ones. Covering a massive civil disturbance is challenging even for
veterans. But these starry-eyed boys and babes arrived here with no
tools at all to cover an outbreak of lawlessness that found many of
them choking on fumes and their own adrenaline. Nor did they know
much of the working-class areas being torched and decimated in what
some would call an "uprising," neighborhoods historically gripped by
poverty, drugs, gang violence and police abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Not that many of their more experienced TV colleagues performed
much better, given their careers as generalists crisscrossing L.A. in
news vans, their coverage of people of color limited mostly to live
stand-ups while blacks and Latinos were led off in handcuffs or
shoved into police cars.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking for itself was the ugly reality of crimes by rioters,
along with collateral damage and casualties. Almost surreal, though,
was the commentary of reporters and especially some anchors who,
roaring through their own warning lights, sought to earn their gaudy
salaries by injecting themselves into stories and fearlessly
dispensing advice to police and city government.</TE>
<TE>   TV's missteps were stunning. No one witnessing it would forget one
reporter being debriefed by an anchor after she had watched a store
looted in South Los Angeles. He: "Did you get the impression that a
lot of those people were illegal aliens?" She: "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   How did she know? One concluded either that these TV sages were
predisposed to believe that undocumented immigrants were
automatically thieves or that the looters had "Illegal" stamped on
their foreheads.</TE>
<TE>   Also perilous were the mixed messages that stations delivered.
Even as most anchors wisely called for cool, street reporters played
airwaves Russian roulette by thrusting live mikes in front of anyone
who would talk. Many obliged, including firebrands calling for
violence in the streets as cameras spread their inflammatory tirades.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, several stations repeatedly reran the King video,
surely aware of its potential to ratchet up anger. TV also egged on
the very violence it was condemning by bathing in hot lights hostile
demonstrations at Parker Center and other locations, blinding police
and making them potential targets.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to turn your lights on," one cop was heard shouting
at a TV crew, "turn them on the crowd, not on the officers."</TE>
<TE>   There were subtler sins. Frequently referring to King only as
"Rodney" tended to infantilize him, the equivalent of calling a black
man "boy." TV fed another misconception by focusing almost entirely
on African Americans' disapproval of the King verdicts, bolstering an
us-against-them scenario that made it appear whites universally
applauded the trial's outcome. Not so.</TE>
<TE>   Time often has a way of knotting loose ends. Two of the four
acquitted police officers were later convicted in a second King trial
in federal court, and physical debris from the riots vanished long
ago, even though emotional residue remains.</TE>
<TE>   How would stations respond if there were similar riots today?
Would they be less impulsive and more responsible? One can only
speculate, but watching them go berserk over Robert Blake's recent
arrest in connection with the murder of his wife bred no optimism.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, many of the media were buried by the wreckage of
their own performance 10 years ago, smoky ruins that have proved
harder to clean up than the pockets of L.A. that came under attack.</TE>

<DH>The cold 'Salton Sea' enthusiastically revels in sleaze
immersion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"We encourage the support of this unique natural resource," the
producers of "The Salton Sea" piously state in the film's closing
credits, though it is not at all clear how having the goodwill of a
smug and tawdry film is going to help that natural landmark. With
friends like this, the Salton Sea will have no need of enemies.</LD>
<LD>   Taking issue with efforts like "The Salton Sea," cold and
unemotional films that couldn't be more pleased at the opportunity to
enthusiastically drag audiences through unhappy material, is as
futile as getting mad at the wind.</LD>
<LD>   As long as a young male audience thinks de facto glamorized drug
addiction is endlessly fascinating, as long as filmmakers feel
immersing themselves in a sleazoids-on-parade world of transgressive
characters is completely cool, as long as studio executives assume
they're acting responsibly if they tack a credits footnote about
substance abuse treatment next to that silly plea for the Salton Sea,
movies like this will continue to be made. And frequently. It's not
clear when and how watching women getting brutalized and seeing a
starved, rabid badger taking realistic swipes at a terrified man' s
private parts added up to mass entertainment, but that's the world
we're living in now.</LD>
<TE>   Written by Tony Gayton ("Murder by Numbers") and directed in his
feature debut by D.J. Caruso, "The Salton Sea" does have a few things
in its favor, including noticeable visual style (Amir Mokri is the
cinematographer) and a story line that takes longer than 10 minutes
to unfold. But a futility and impotence surround those qualities;
they play as no more than window dressing vainly attempting to
camouflage distant, off-putting material.</TE>
<TE>   Given that scenario, it's not surprising to find Val Kilmer and
Vincent D' Onofrio in the film's leading roles. Both men are fine
actors, but there are probably no two performers who are more in love
with playing dress-up to the exclusion of everything else, with
submerging themselves body and soul in weird characters, the weirder
the better.</TE>
<TE>   "The Salton Sea" opens with a jejune, overly familiar moment that
is probably meant to be haunting. A man (Kilmer) sits calmly playing
the trumpet as his surroundings go up in flames, trying to determine
his own identity. Is he Danny Parker or Tom Van Allen, he asks in
pseudo-sensitive voice-over, "avenging angel or Judas Iscariot. You
decide who I am." Oh, brother.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Parker, it turns out, is a complete speed freak, a character
who lives in a world of days-long drug binges that the film
re-creates in careful, loving and increasingly tedious detail. Which
is just how Kilmer physically creates his character, down to Danny's
extensive tattoos, elaborate chains, silver death's-head rings on
nearly every finger, and pomaded, green-tinged hair.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to convey how pleased with itself this film is to
be inside what it presents as the daring, fascinating world of
"tweakers," one of numerous slang phrases for methamphetamine users
and the drug itself that come up again and again in the screenplay as
verbal convincers for its authenticity. Even the film itself must
sense how off-putting this is, because it has Danny say in
voice-over, "I know what you're thinking. Don't give up on me yet."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that fascinates "The Salton Sea" more than users
are the twisted, cardboard criminals that inevitably swarm into this
world and who we are shanghaied into spending time with. For
instance:</TE>
<TE>   * Bobby (Glenn Plummer), a completely addled dealer who
hallucinates spiders and occupies himself beating the girlfriend he
keeps stashed and squashed underneath his mattress;</TE>
<TE>   * Quincy (Luis Guzman), a surly lout always shown either just
about to or just having finished beating the tar out of his
unfortunate girlfriend Colette (Deborah Kara Unger);</TE>
<TE>   * Morgan (Doug Hutchison) and Garcetti (Anthony LaPaglia), the
vicious and corrupt police officers we've come to expect in an
atmosphere like this;</TE>
<TE>   * Pooh-Bear (D'Onofrio), the film's lowlife piece de resistance,
who spends his spare time re-creating the Kennedy assassination with
pigeons standing in for the first family. In an especially charming
touch this rascal, named after the A.A. Milne character always
getting his nose caught in the honey jar, has inhaled so many drugs
his nose had to be very obviously amputated. And yes, we get to see
the gnarly remains.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually "The Salton Sea" reveals who Tom Van Allen is and how he
relates to Danny, and frankly it's a tossup which character you least
want to spend time with. "So who am I after all is said and done?"
Danny/Tom asks once more at the close. "You tell me. I'm too tired."
That makes two of us, pal, that makes two of us.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong violence, drug use, language and some
sexuality. Times guidelines: extensive drug use and a strong scene of
a rabid badger menacing a defenseless human.</TE>

<DH>In the stylized 'Night at the Golden Eagle,' denizens and
crooks of a romanticized L.A. skid row dream big.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year or so ago, filmmaker Adam Rifkin met Donnie Montemarano and
Vinny Argiro, lifelong pals from Brooklyn, and was so taken with
their colorful personalities and stories he soon realized he had at
last discovered the leads for his next film, "Night at the Golden
Eagle"--never mind that the two men had no acting experience.</LD>
<LD>   Rifkin's gamble paid off, for the two prove to be naturals,
without a trace of self-consciousness. The result is a stylized
melodrama, oozing in picturesque skid row seediness and given an aura
of poignant authenticity by the sturdy, vital presence of Montemarano
and Argiro.</LD>
<LD>   The film opens with Argiro's Mic meeting Montemarano's Tommy at a
prison, where he is being released by his warden (James Caan, in a
cameo). (Montemarano actually served 11 years for a racketeering
conviction.) Upset that Mic no longer has his car, Tommy suggests
stealing another instead of taking the bus. He's only half-joking
because we quickly discover that Tommy is a small-time crook who is
forever going too far and often bringing down Mic with him.</LD>
<TE>   Mic is nevertheless thrilled to be with his old pal again and
outlines his dreams for their future. Mic's been living in a dingy
old L.A. skid row hotel, the Golden Eagle, and clerking at a nearby
porn store. But he's managed to save up $2,500 for them to start new
lives in Las Vegas as blackjack dealers and has already purchased a
pair of bus tickets so they can take off the next morning. It hardly
leaves Tommy time to louse up what Mic realistically sees as the last
chance either of them will have for a decent, stable existence.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Rifkin pulls back to place Tommy and Mic in the
context of the people and events in the same night at the Golden
Eagle. A subplot soon emerges with seasoned streetwalker Sally (Ann
Magnuson) being told by her tough pimp Rodan (Vinnie Jones) to show
the ropes to teenage Lori Ann (Nicole Jacobs), a runaway with dreams
of becoming an actress. Lori Anne brings out the protective, maternal
instincts in Sally. Rifkin counterpoints the complexities of Tommy
and Mic's friendship with the one developing between Sally and Lori
Ann, with Mic and Sally emerging at the wiser but more vulnerable in
the parallel relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Living in the room below Mic is Cornelius Maynard, the surviving
half of a famed team of dancing brothers, and he is beautifully
played by the great Fayard Nicholas, the surviving half of the
legendary Nicholas brothers. Sam Moore (part of the legendary R&amp;B
group Sam and Dave) is Sylvester, his TV-watching pal with
delusions--or so they seem--of grandeur past. Miles Dougal is a
sullen, bored young clerk; nearby outside is a homeless bag lady,
played by none other than Russ Meyer favorite Kitten Natividad, who
is unrecognizable until she has a drug-induced dream in which she
imagines herself in a ball gown dancing with a man in white tie and
tails.</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin's script has considerable theatricality, with some touches
of dark humor and sentimentality, and Rifkin goes with that tone with
appropriate panache. His skid row is romanticized, with the residents
living in artful, bohemian decay instead of outright stark squalor,
and it's been a long time since skid row-vicinity hookers looked as
good as Sally and Lori Anne. Since Rifkin struck gold with
Montemarano and Argiro, it's too bad he didn't stick longer with them
and back off on his more familiar take on streetwalkers' sordid,
brutal existence. That said, the always-distinctive Magnuson
illuminates the extreme degree of willed self-denial Sally must exert
if she is to survive.</TE>
<TE>   All of Rifkin's key people are dreamers living marginal,
impoverished existences, except for Cornelius Maynard, who like
Fayard Nicholas himself, has known real fame and acclaim and is
warmed by golden memories. Suffused with an apt sepia glow by
Rifkin's highly creative cameraman Checco Varese, "Night at the
Golden Eagle" is a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with
ease and confidence.</TE>

<DH>'Dogtown and Z-Boys' revisits a legacy of agility and
attitude.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You could draw a straight line, as the new documentary "Dogtown and
Z-Boys" doesn't hesitate to do, between the Z-Boys, a scruffy group
of outlaw Southern California surfers and skateboarders of the 1970s,
and a modern extreme-sports movement so pervasive it's gotten into
the Olympics and onto U.S. postage stamps.</LD>
<LD>   And don't the Z-Boys know it.</LD>
<LD>   What audiences might not know but can guess from the film's
self-congratulatory tone is that this doc was co-written and directed
by Stacy Peralta, a Z-Boy himself. Also Vans, the sneaker company
oh-so-casually mentioned as the Z-Boys' shoe of choice, financed the
film. Isn't it wonderful when friends help friends?</LD>
<TE>   This chumminess points to flaws in what could easily have been a
better documentary. Certainly the Z-Boys' story is a compelling and
culturally significant one, and the vintage footage that goes along
with it is really something to see.</TE>
<TE>   Shot by Craig Stecyk and Glen E. Friedman back in the 1970s, the
home movies of the Z-Boys, especially superstars-in-the-making Jay
Adams and Tony Alva, showing off the moves that revolutionized
skateboarding, are fluid, stylish and original, and having the chance
to watch them in their prime is a wonder.</TE>
<TE>   But as graceful as this group is on the board, that's how
graceless it tends to be off it. They're defiant bad boys to the
core, full to bursting with in-your-face animosity, still boasting
decades later about the fights they got into back in the day.</TE>
<TE>   On one level, who can blame them? They did it their way and made
it work, becoming celebrities and influencing kids all over the
world. On the other hand, that undeniable success can't hide that
it's truly tiresome to spend 90 minutes in their self-satisfied
company. Few things in this life age less attractively than bad boys
who never felt the need to grow up.</TE>
<TE>   Though director and co-writer (along with production designer
Stecyk) Peralta has created a clever visual package for his story, a
more impartial filmmaker might have understood the need for other
voices to balance against all that attitude, might have understood
how hungry the film makes us for even a single non-adulatory moment.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's not surprising that there was only one girl on the
original Z-Boys team, it is a bit of a shock to realize that except
for her, not a single woman is interviewed for this project. Mothers,
sisters, even current or former wives might have provided a different
perspective, as might the grown-up versions of those lithesome
girlfriends glimpsed in the home-movie footage. But anyone unlikely
to burnish the image apparently wasn't allowed near the camera.</TE>
<TE>   Convincingly narrated by Sean Penn, "Dogtown" gives a detailed and
fascinating picture of the Z-Boys phenomenon. It all started in
Dogtown, a marginal neighborhood including parts of Venice, Ocean
Park and South Santa Monica and described by the boys as "the last
great seaside slum," and "where the debris meets the sea."</TE>
<TE>   The catalyst for the team was the Jeff Ho &amp; Zephyr Production Surf
Shop, founded by Ho, Stecyk and Skip Engblom to produce customized,
ahead-of-the-curve surfboards. The future Z-Boys started as
youngsters who surfed around the jutting piers of the Pacific Ocean
Park amusement zone, used the surf shop as a clubhouse and pioneered
a surfing-inspired style of skateboarding that blossomed post-1972
when resilient polyurethane wheels came into vogue.</TE>
<TE>   Using that vintage footage, "Dogtown" shows how the Z-Boys'
skating style took an unexpected turn when a 1970s drought emptied
swimming pools across the L.A. area and led to "the birth of
vertical," the creation of skateboarding moves that went up curved
walls for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from illuminating how Stecyk's articles in SkateBoarder
magazine helped turn the Z-Boys into a phenomenon, "Dogtown" is at
its dramatic best with mini-profiles of its two biggest names, Adams
and Alva. The Adams segment especially, which shows the most
naturally gifted of the Z-Boys regretful about the bad choices he
made in his life, provides the kind of thoughtful introspection this
film could have used a lot more of.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for language and some drug references. Times
guidelines: bad language and attitude.</TE>

<HD>With Conviction, a Look at Convictions</HD>
<DH>'The Exonerated' collects true tales of those who were
wrongfully placed on death row. It's vivid and thought-provoking at
the Actors' Gang.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To speak of life-or-death stakes in "The Exonerated" is, for once, no
exaggeration. Created and directed by New York-based Jessica Blank
and Erik Jensen from interviews they conducted with former death row
inmates whose wrongful convictions were eventually overturned, a
riveting Actors' Gang staging examines capital punishment and the
justice system in chilling terms.</LD>
<LD>   By depicting the stories of six innocent people (out of 100
similar cases and rising), this devastating docudrama proves more
profound and persuasive than any rhetorical pitch to abstract moral
principles.</LD>
<LD>   In some respects, Blank and Jensen's effort was simplified by the
drama inherent in the facts. Nevertheless, the work benefits from the
skillful way the stories are interwoven and paced to build tension
and momentum. Rising to the importance of their task, a talented
Actors' Gang ensemble makes the most of this charged material.</LD>
<TE>   In direct-to-the-audience narratives culled almost entirely from
the survivors' own words, we meet victims from all walks of life and
different parts of the country. Some were targets of political
expediency--the need to close a case at any cost--like a yoga teacher
(Adele Robbins) who spent 16 years in prison for the murder of two
Florida state troopers, 13 of which came after an acquaintance
admitted he had falsely accused her. Or the mild-mannered farmer
(Brian Powell) who was asked to hypothesize a "vision statement,"
imagining how he might have killed his parents. It was then
introduced as a confession at his trial.</TE>
<TE>   Others bore the stigmata of racial animus, like the
sweet-tempered, naive black teenager (Ben Cain) who was held
incommunicado for a week before signing a confession drafted for him.
Or the fiercely eloquent former seminary student (Richard Lawson) who
serves as the central narrator, charged for a murder--in a state he
hadn't even visited--solely on the basis of his skin color.</TE>
<TE>   All of these people shared only the unsettling predicament of
being in the wrong place at the wrong time, unable to defend
themselves against circumstances that conspired against them. As one
reminds us, it can happen to anyone.</TE>
<TE>   While many of the protagonists had the nobility to make peace with
their experience, the fact that they eventually regained their
freedom offers scant comfort. There is no way that white former
bartender Kerry Cook (Ken Palmer) can erase the invectives carved
into his flesh during his stay in prison. Former jockey Robert Hays
(Ken Elliott) was unable to regain his racing license to pursue his
occupation after his release. And Jesse Tafero, whose story we hear
only second-hand, was unavailable for interviews, having undergone a
horrific electrocution that required three jolts and took 13 minutes,
before evidence proving his innocence came to light.</TE>
<TE>   While capital punishment occupies the forefront here because it is
irreversible, the underlying indictment embraces the broader
fallibility of our justice system. There is no way to dismiss these
stark case histories as statistical aberrations--we can and must do
better.</TE>

<HD>A Return to Normal After 9/11</HD>
<DH>The latest Arbitron ratings show listeners falling back
into old habits, causing numbers for some news and talk stations to
drop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After tuning to news and talk stations following the September
terrorist attacks, Southland radio listeners have started punching
their old presets again, while the alternative rockers at KROQ-FM
solidified their grasp at the pinnacle of local ratings, according to
the latest figures released by ratings service Arbitron.</LD>
<LD>   The folks at KROQ (106.7) seem to have signed at least a year's
lease on their perch at the top of Southern California standings,
posting an impressive fourth straight quarter as the highest-rated
station in the Los Angeles-Orange County market and grabbing 5.1% of
the audience. The winter 2002 ratings, charting the period from Jan.
3 to March 27, also showed gains by hip-hop outlet KPWR-FM (105.9)
and adult contemporary KOST-FM (103.5).</LD>
<LD>   But the disparities between the fall and winter ratings among
Southland news, information and talk stations weren't as severe as
those in the rest of the country. Talker KFI-AM (640) was fourth in
the region with a 4% share of the audience, dipping slightly from
4.2% in the fall, while rival KABC-AM (790) fell a bit farther, from
2.6 to 2.2--the same figure it had in the summer.</LD>
<TE>   "The spikes seemed to be more pronounced the closer you were to
New York, and of course New York had the biggest spikes," said Ron
Rodrigues, editor in chief of the trade journal Radio &amp; Records. The
most extreme example was New York City's all-news station WINS-AM,
which Arbitron determined had a staggering 70% share in the hours
after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't as much, if any, of a spike in Los Angeles or the
Western markets," Rodrigues said, suggesting that trend started Sept.
11. On the East Coast, the attacks began while most people were
driving to or were already at work, so most of them got the news that
day from radio and simply stayed with the habit. On the West Coast,
the events happened while most people slept, and they awoke to the
news on television.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor may be that some listeners stuck with their
favorite stations, such as KKBT-FM (100.3) "The Beat," which
increased its news reports at the time to keep people abreast of
events, said the urban station's vice president and general manager,
Nancy Leichter.</TE>
<TE>   "It made us better," she said. "I think that's why we didn't lose
in the fall. People tune in to us for more than just music."</TE>
<TE>   No matter where they were getting their information, Rodrigues
said, "people are still listening more than they did before. A lot of
the audience moved from the all-news stations to talk stations."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, though KFI and KABC dropped somewhat, and KLSX-FM (97.1)
held steady, all three talk stations were higher than in winter 2001.
Meanwhile, among the all-news stations--both owned by Viacom's
Infinity radio unit--KNX rose slightly, while KFWB dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Moore, vice president and general manager at Infinity's KLSX,
said sister station KROQ hasn't tied its fortunes to the rise and
fall of pop's flavor of the month--meaning the station not only can
showcase new bands, such as System of a Down or the Strokes, but draw
from the catalog of older alternative acts that have been around as
long as the station has. He noted that, during a recent U2 concert in
L.A., Bono thanked KROQ from the stage for playing the band's music
for the past two decades.</TE>
<TE>   KROQ also scored well in the battle of morning-drive shows, a key
part of the day in local radio. Morning duo Kevin &amp; Bean improved on
their best-ever showing, a 5% share in the fall, to 5.1% among
listeners 12 and older.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a couple of guys on the radio who happen to be funny,"
Kevin Weatherly, KROQ's vice president of programming, said of his
morning team. "They've been on the air now for 12 years, and the
listeners have finally caught on to what we've known all along."</TE>
<TE>   However, they remain far behind top-rated Renan Almendarez Coello,
on Spanish-language KSCA-FM (101.9), who slipped but still maintained
his dominance. Known as "El Cucuy," Coello still holds a huge lead in
spite of dropping from 7.5% of the audience to 6.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Among listeners ages 25 to 54, the primary demographic for radio
advertisers, Kevin &amp; Bean placed third, at 5%, while second-place
Howard Stern on KLSX dropped to 5.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The winter-quarter numbers showed KKBT-FM "The Beat" and KPWR
"Power 106" heading in different directions. The Beat dropped from
third overall to ninth compared with the previous quarter and second
to fifth place in the morning, where comedian Steve Harvey's show had
been steadily chugging ever higher in the ratings since it started in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Power 106, on the other hand, jumped from seventh to second
overall, increasing its ratings from 4% of the audience to 5%, and
from eighth to fourth in the morning. KPWR's numbers had declined
from summer to fall, while KKBT's went up.</TE>
<TE>   "We never believed in the first place we were ever a '4' [rating]
radio station," said Dianna Obermeyer, senior vice president of Emmis
Communications/Los Angeles, which owns Power 106. She said the winter
numbers were the best ratings book for the station since the summer
of 1995, and said the fall figures were just a quirk, noting that the
station was second in both the spring and summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Our programming remains constant, our personalities are the
same," she said, adding that she is even more optimistic about her
station's future, predicting that it will get a boost from
much-anticipated new albums coming out from rappers Nelly and Eminem.</TE>
<TE>   Leichter also blamed a ratings aberration for KKBT's decline from
fall to winter, the fact that Arbitron was switching from using 1990
Census figures to 2000 numbers as the basis for its sampling.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it was just sort of a fluke. There are wobbles. It's just
the vagaries of Arbitron," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigues joked that it's common for stations to attack the
messenger, blaming Arbitron for their ratings troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "Radio programmers are very quick to take the credit when they
have a good book," he said. And when the numbers go down? "It's like
a field-goal kicker: if you miss it, it was because the snap was bad
or the wind was blowing."</TE>

<HD>Basic Cable, Network TV Chip Away at Carlin's Seven Dirty
Words</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL FARHI</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detective Vic Mackey is not a very nice man. A rogue TV cop in the
grand tradition of rogue TV cops, Mackey (Michael Chiklis) dispenses
his own brand of street justice, roughing up perps and intimidating
informants. And gosh oh golly, can he ever swear.</LD>
<LD>   On "The Shield," a new series on cable's FX network, Mackey bags
the bad guys with a vocabulary that would shock Dirty Harry. He
describes a drug suspect as a certain bodily orifice. He uses a
common expletive, twice, and refers to a sex act in no uncertain
terms.</LD>
<LD>   And this before the first commercial break on the first episode.</LD>
<TE>   That "The Shield" is a weekly series on basic cable, available in
almost 80% of U.S. television homes, says something about the state
of profanity on television. Mostly it is this: Just when it seems
that TV networks are drawing the line, they move the line again.</TE>
<TE>   In "A Season on the Brink," a made-for-TV movie carried on ESPN
last month, basketball coach Bobby Knight (played by Brian Dennehy)
drops the F-word 15 times in the first 15 minutes. MTV's "The
Osbournes," about a real-life family, is so riddled with crude words
that the bleeps almost outnumber the audible words. In recent months,
a crass word for "jerk" has popped up on "The Practice," "NYPD Blue"
and "ER."</TE>
<TE>   Viewers who subscribe to HBO may be used to such things, what with
that network's foulmouthed gangsters, convicts and single gals ("The
Sopranos," "Oz," "Sex and the City," respectively). But HBO's
customers pay monthly fees to receive programs that are more explicit
than those on the rest of TV. The news here is that the rest of TV is
closing the gap: Basic cable and broadcast--the most widely available
form of television--are getting increasingly down and dirty.</TE>
<TE>   Even the previously sacrosanct "family hour" (8-9 p.m.) isn't
inviolate. Between 1996 and 2001, the frequency of profanities
roughly tripled on the leading networks during the hour once set
aside for feel-good fare like "Little House on the Prairie,"
according to the Parents Television Council, an organization that
monitors TV content. Fox rang up almost four crude words per hour on
average, most among the Big Four (Fox, CBS, NBC and ABC), the PTC
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe the process has been driven by "Sopranos" envy--a
desire by producers to mimic the critically acclaimed HBO series. The
groundbreaking show is casually laced with the kinds of words that
George Carlin once said could never be mentioned on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, there's a real frustration among writers and directors
that they don't get to play with the same toys as those in pay TV,"
said Bryce Zabel, a producer who is chairman of the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   But Dick Wolf, producer of the "Law &amp; Order" programs on NBC,
rejects that argument: "It all comes back to storytelling," he said.
"There are no bad words in Shakespeare, and he seems to have done all
right."</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the middle, network executives say what's acceptable is
necessarily a moving target, etched in sand, not stone. As social
mores evolve, they say, television is always hustling to keep up.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last [few] years, certain words have become more a part of
the culture," said Martin Franks, who oversees CBS' standards and
practices department. "In a world in which eighth- and ninth-grade
schoolyards are filled with more words than we'd allow on our air, at
some point you have to ask who is protecting whom, and from what."</TE>
<TE>   That is, in fact, much the way the federal government sees it.
When he was asked recently at a broadcast industry convention whether
the Federal Communications Commission had been lax in enforcing
regulations aimed at "indecent" speech on radio and TV, FCC Chairman
Michael Powell responded: "This is an increasingly diverse society.
Claiming there is just one community today is just not true.... Our
society is supposed to be strong enough to sustain" a diversity of
views.</TE>
<TE>   Up until the early 1980s, the three leading networks subscribed to
a common code, making TV content reasonably uniform in tone. But this
was abandoned under antitrust pressure from the federal government
and independent broadcasters. Since then, each network has been free
to define its own notions of acceptable behavior and language. The
process has become increasingly complicated by competition; each
network now has to weigh its decisions against those of dozens of
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's prime-time viewers are younger than CBS' and therefore, the
network says, more tolerant of profanity. "In the proper context, if
some [swear word] is well motivated and germane to the story, there
is an acceptance by our core audience," said Roland McFarland, Fox's
chief censor. McFarland said context, experience and audience
expectations guide Fox's review of scripts. The rule of thumb: Don't
surprise or jar viewers with something they didn't expect to hear.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers hardly seem exercised by the increasing trash talk.
Network representatives say offensive language ranks low on the list
of things that viewers complain about--far behind the two biggest
bugaboos, program preemptions and cancellations.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's experience with "Season on the Brink" suggests audiences
may be ready for even more profanity. ESPN showed two versions of its
movie simultaneously--one uncut on ESPN, another on ESPN2 with the
salty language excised.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers chose the foulmouthed Knight over his bleeped-out twin by
a margin of nearly 7 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Is everything up for grabs? Fox's McFarland says no, that strong
taboos remain in place against racist or sexist insults. "That is
where we truly draw the line," he said. "We take great care in
eliminating that" from Fox programs.</TE>

<HD>'freshmen' Makes the Grade With Authentic View of College
Life</HD>
<DH>Tom Huang's film surprises with its impressive depth and
detail of characterizations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Huang's "freshmen" is far removed from the usual college movies,
as amusing as they can sometimes be, and so authentic it's like
eavesdropping on life.</LD>
<LD>   It was supposed to be a 50-minute graduate-school thesis film at
Loyola Marymount University, but Huang got a green light from his
faculty advisor by not showing him his entire script in order to have
access to university equipment and facilities to complete, with an
assist from friends, the 121-minute feature over the course of one
year.</LD>
<LD>   Huang's ruse has paid off. With wit and detachment, Huang follows
four freshmen, who meet in a history discussion group in their first
quarter at Los Angeles University--read Loyola.</LD>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the four have differing personalities and
backgrounds; what is surprising is the impressive depth and detail of
Huang's characterizations, his keen ear for dialogue and his ability
to get his actors to seem to be living their roles. Much of the time
it is easy to forget that "freshmen" is fictional and not a
documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Tonisha (N.D. Brown) is an African American from Compton who
cannot afford to drop her part-time supermarket cashier's job. Huang
casts himself as San, a Chinese American whose brush with an affront
during Rush Week causes him to question his cultural identity for the
first time and realize that he knows next to nothing of his heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Kohler's Rick is a nice but insular kid from Baltimore who is
unintentionally racially and ethnically insensitive. Margaret
Scarborough's Judy is a pretty Kansan who becomes giddy at the
prospect of sorority life.</TE>
<TE>   These likable young people become friends, seeing each other
through various crises, one of them decidedly major. We see them
evolve three-dimensionally: Tonisha, for example, can become
understandably irritable under the heavy load she's carrying,
wondering whether she has the stamina and resolve to fulfill her
dream.</TE>
<TE>   Confusing San's quest for self-acceptance is that he finds himself
dating both Judy's mature and lovely roommate (Wendy Speake) and a
pretty Chinese American student (Mary Chen). Supported first by Rick
and then the others, Judy, wholly unexpectedly, faces the greatest
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Variety's reviewer aptly remarked that "freshmen" is a solid
calling card for Huang and his cast. Although Huang wrote terrific
parts for his actors, including himself, they all exhibit the talent
and focus to bring their characters fully alive. Wisely, Huang
concentrated on his story and people rather than camera angles.</TE>
<TE>   "Freshmen" could have benefited from tighter editing and more
stylish structuring, yet even though it runs too long, it is so
involving that the length doesn't detract that much from its
impressive impact.</TE>

<HD>Cambodian Pushes for Revival of Film Industry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENIS D. GRAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TAKHMAU, Cambodia</DL>
<LD>Cambodia's once-robust movie world lies beneath the rice paddies,
where the bones of glamorous stars molder together with miles of
classic celluloid that Khmer Rouge zealots strung out to measure
distances.</LD>
<LD>   It's been more than two decades since the fall of the fanatic
communist regime, but there's been no return to the heyday of
Cambodian cinema, which created more than 300 films, some recognized
across Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Today, there's not a single 35mm camera in the impoverished
country. There's only one movie theater, compared with 33 before the
Khmer Rouge terror. And just half a dozen feature films, virtually
all made with significant foreign input, have appeared in the past 23
years.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the odds, a handful of die-hards are determined to revive
Cambodian film. One is Ly Bun Yim, a rare survivor from the old days,
when he was probably Cambodia's finest and most successful director.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I die, I want to share my knowledge with a new
generation--free of charge," says the 60-year-old moviemaker.</TE>
<TE>   He proudly gives a tour of a three-story structure, fringed by
palm trees, that he is building as a filmmaking center on the
southern outskirts of the capital, Phnom Penh. For now, its rooms
feature mounds of cement, piles of planks and raw brickwork. But in
his mind's eye, Ly Bun Yim sees glittering sets, an auditorium and a
classroom filled with budding actors and directors.</TE>
<TE>   He dreams that Cambodia's revived movie industry will co-exist
proudly with foreign imports, as in other Asian nations, such as
Japan, Taiwan and Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   Ly Bun Yim, a farmer's son who fell in love with photography as a
boy, is now gathering funds to purchase a camera and other equipment
and plans to direct several films, including a Romeo-and-Juliet story
based on a classic Cambodian tale.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first truly home-grown products of recent decades is
now showing to audiences willing to pay three times the ticket price
for foreign films. "Decho Domen" tells of a womanizing hero who drove
out Thai invaders in the 12th century.</TE>
<TE>   The film cost $160,000 to make--a huge sum by Cambodian
standards--and was shot on video, which was remastered onto 35mm film
in California.</TE>
<TE>   Other recent Cambodian films have depended on foreign funds and
technical expertise. Last year's "Puos Keng Kon," or "Giant Snake,"
was as much Thai as Cambodian, and Rithy Pan, arguably the country's
finest director, lives mostly in France and depends on foreign
backing.</TE>
<TE>   Cambodians shot their first movies in the 1940s, when Prince
Sihanouk, now the king, churned out films that won little praise from
serious critics but racked up awards at his own film festivals.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he helped usher in the golden era, from the mid-1960s to
the early '70s, when Cambodians flocked to their own films despite
the popularity of imports from India, Hong Kong and the West. Then in
1975, the Khmer Rouge crushed the U.S.-backed government.</TE>
<TE>   "The Khmer Rouge regarded movies as entertainment for the
bourgeoisie that had to be destroyed, and that included the actors,
directors and producers themselves, as well as the equipment and
movies," says Som Sokun, who heads the Ministry of Culture's film
department.</TE>

<HD>Diverse Influences Help Artists Produce Beats Without
Borders</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>World music has always occupied a somewhat hazy position within the
recording industry, largely because of its enormously diverse range.
Embracing styles that can generally be described as pop music,
traditional music and classical--with frequent crosscurrents between
each--it is a genre that resists the usual pigeon-hole definition the
industry prefers.</LD>
<LD>   In general, that's a blessing for the world music fan. But the
record business, recognizing the appeal of unusual and unfamiliar
sounds, has worked hard to fit them into what it knows best: the
territory of pop music. The result has been the emergence of a parade
of hybrid world music forms. Although different in origin, they are
strikingly similar in their reduction of an extraordinary assortment
of complex rhythms to repetitive dance beats, and in their
replacement of traditional modes and scales with layers of synth
sounds and wearying melodic riffing.</LD>
<LD>   Given the relatively small amount of musically rewarding material
within that particular world music arena, I've chosen to focus this
report on the most appealing releases of the first quarter of 2002,
recordings that, for the most part, illustrate the variety, rather
than the fusion aspects, of the music that is happening around the
globe.</LD>
<TE>   Start with a few divas. And, in this case, with divas who all have
connections--although very different connections--with Portuguese
culture:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angelique Kidjo. "Black Ivory Soul" (Columbia). Benin-born Kidjo's
music has suggested linkages with Brazil in the past, but never so
strongly as in this collection, her debut outing on Columbia. Among
the highlights are collaborations with Brazilian greats Carlinhos
Brown and Vinicius Cantuaria, with such fine instrumentalists as
guitarist Romero Lubambo playing prominent roles. It's one of Kidjo's
most engaging and musically memorable CDs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Monica Salmaso. "Voadeira" (Blue Jackel Records). The relatively
unknown (in this country) Brazilian singer has a superb voice, one
that follows in the tradition of artists such as Elis Regina and Gal
Costa. Her program of largely unfamiliar material is delivered in
relatively modest instrumental settings, allowing her honey-toned
contralto to take center stage. Salmaso makes her first Los Angeles
appearance Sept. 8 at the Hollywood Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mariza. "Fado Em Mim" (Times Square Records). The title means "The
Fado in Me," and Mariza, still in her 20s, has already become a vital
practitioner of the Portuguese vocal art. She sings a program
blending classic fado with newer works, endowing them with a rich
assortment of vocal timbres and a subtle sense of theatrical timing.
Mariza, too, makes her Hollywood Bowl debut this year, on July 14.</TE>
<TE>   Irish/Celtic music manages to be extremely popular--I probably
receive more albums in this genre than any other--and closely in
touch with its roots (rock bands such as U2 are an entirely different
matter):</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mick Moloney. "Far From the Shamrock Shore" (Shanachie Records).
Talking about roots, here is a wonderful anthology tracing Irish
history in the U.S. via 17 songs performed by singer Maloney and a
gifted group of players (including, among others, Eileen Ivers, Bruce
Molsky and John Doyle). The set, aside from its winning music, also
includes immensely informative essays examining the history of each
tune.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Sounds of Ireland" (Columbia Legacy). Continuing to mine
Celtic riches from its musical vaults, Columbia has released five
more CDs featuring some of the artists who were most influential in
bringing the music to wider public attention in the mid- and late
20th century: "The Chieftains 7," "The Chieftains 8," "The Chieftains
9: Boil the Breakfast Early," "The Best of the Chieftains" and "The
Best of the Clancy Brothers &amp; Tommy Makem."</TE>
<TE>   The Rough Guide books on world music are invaluable sources of
information. As a kind of audio companion to the books, the company
has been publishing a series of CDs, sometimes organized around a
specific geographic area, sometimes surveying an individual style.
The most recent albums are typical of the broad selection of choices
in the Rough Guide recording catalog:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Paris Cafe Music: Bal Musette to Rock Musette." Think of Paris
cafes and what immediately comes to mind is the sound of the
accordion and the voice of Edith Piaf. Both are heard in this
eclectic gathering. But so are some original musette sounds (the
musette is actually a kind of mini-bagpipe) and songs from the
Auvergne as well as the more contemporary interpretations of bands
such as Ramses and Les Primitifs du Futur (who feature cartoonist
Robert Crumb playing mandolin and banjo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Bollywood: The Glitz, the Glamour, the Soundtrack." It's called
"Bollywood," but it's actually the film industry of Bombay, India,
which produces more films than Hollywood itself. Most are musicals in
which attractive young film stars lip-sync songs to performances by
the industry's famous recording artists. The collection features two
of the best-known: the sisters Asha Bhonsle and Lata Mangeshkar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Haiti: African Heartbeat of the Caribbean." A fascinating look at
the rich but often overlooked music of the world's first black
republic. The startling diversity of the selections underscores
Haitian music's seeming contradiction of retaining powerful African
elements while remaining wide open to influences from Cuban son,
Dominican merengue, American jazz, funk and soul.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Nigeria &amp; Ghana: Juju, Afrobeat, Fuji." Selections from two of
Africa's most musically vital countries, from the early rhythms of
highlife to the more contemporary minimalism of Fuji, with selections
from E.T. Mensah (the "king of Highlife") to the exuberant King Sunny
Ade.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan: Sufi Sounds From the Qwaali King." The
great Pakistani qwaali singer is well represented in collections
released in the U.S. This group of eight tracks, drawn from eight
albums, touches upon Khan's classical repertoire, as well as his more
popularly oriented efforts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Louisiana: A State of Musical Giants." The Mississippi Delta may
be best known as the birthplace of jazz, but it is also the home to a
cornucopia of other musical styles, including Cajun, zydeco, blues
and gospel. All are represented in this collection, which includes
(among many others) tracks by Champion Jack Dupree, Dr. John,
Beausoleil, Buckwheat Zydeco and Irma Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Bellydance." Here it is, the perfect soundtrack for tying a scarf
around your hips and doing it yourself. Although the music is clearly
aimed at accompaniment, the presence of such fine musicians as oud
player Rabih Abou Khalil and multi-instrumentalist Omar Faruk
Tekbilek is an added benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is the great, multicolored musical tapestry
reaching from Europe to the east, the product of an array of cultures
constantly interacting and overlapping with each other:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Silk Road: A Musical Caravan" (Smithsonian Folkways). The
Silk Road, crisscrossing from Europe to Asia, brought trade, art,
technology and ideas from one culture to another, with music a
prominent part of the mix.</TE>
<TE>   This two-CD collection, produced in collaboration with the Silk
Road Project, an international global initiative founded by cellist
Yo-Yo Ma, includes 47 tracks embracing entries from Afghanistan,
China, Iran, Mongolia and other Asian and Eurasian nations along the
Silk Road. The music is an extraordinary display of sounds and
rhythms, of brilliant virtuosity and exotic timbres, of nomadic
music, spiritual music and minstrelsy.</TE>

<HD>'T-Files' Portrays the Dark Side of Teen Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of the young cast members have done TV commercials, shows and
music videos; most have performed in school or community productions.
But communicating, not expert acting, is what the expletive-laden,
pop music-driven, rough-edged, angry and painfully sincere
teen-centric play "The T-Files" is all about.</LD>
<LD>   Presented at the newly opened Brick Box space in Hollywood by the
California Youth Theatre and BB's Kids Professional Teens, "The
T-Files" offers up the dark side of adolescence. Personal stories
relate the anguish of isolation, domestic abuse, taunting and
bullying, sex, drugs, secret fears--and parents, tuned out, absent or
seriously dysfunctional.</LD>
<LD>   Performed by students, ages 13 to 20, from Southland middle
schools, high schools and colleges, and set on a graffiti-splashed
high school campus, the play was developed in a series of
improvisations by Belinda Balaski and her BB's Kids group.</LD>
<TE>   Professional director Corky Dominguez has given the grim
testimonials a theatrical shape, with strobe-light effects, a loud,
angry rock beat, frozen tableaux of teens in various groupings as
background to the action, and characters who step out of the story
into a spotlight to share their thoughts and histories, despair and
rage.</TE>
<TE>   It's uneven in execution, and some actors are more adept than
others at maintaining character and dramatic rhythm, but the cast's
emotional involvement is palpable in the show's escalation of events
involving a desperate, taunted, drug-using girl named V, who gains
access to a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Other anxious, tormented or sad teens who are part of the story
are Heather, the daughter of a wife-beater, who perpetuates the
pattern with her abusive boyfriend, Will; V's boyfriend Chico, who
sells drugs and shakes down other students for cash; and cheerleader
Holly, who learns that her cheating boyfriend has given her
chlamydia. Kids struggling with not fitting in are new kid Jesse,
nerdy Sean, high-achiever Daisy and Aiesha, a good student with a
secret past.</TE>
<TE>   Four different casts perform in rotation. At a recent matinee,
Marion Elizabeth and Nino Aldi were alarmingly convincing as V and
Will, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   As unremittingly fraught and rough-edged as this production is,
with its adult language, violence and sexual themes, it nevertheless
communicates the vulnerability and fear--and the need for caring
parental involvement--behind those closed-off, we-know-everything
facades.</TE>

<TE>   "The T-Files," Brick Box, 1608 Cosmo St., Hollywood, Fridays and

<HD>Phil Donahue Steps in to Balance the Scales</HD>
<DH>Television: Amid the talk-show ascendancy of conservatives,
the veteran host's return later in the year is something of a shock
to liberals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NOEL HOLSTON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's hear it for free enterprise. Under what other system would a
big corporation give a communist a nightly national talk show because
its executives believe he can make them richer?</LD>
<LD>   Not that MSNBC pundit-to-be Phil Donahue is really a communist, or
even a socialist. He's never advocated the overthrow of the
government, unless stumping for a Ralph Nader presidency counts as a
coup attempt. No matter how pink his designated prime-time opponent,
Fox News Channel star Bill O'Reilly, might paint him before their
face-off begins later this year, Donahue is nothing but an
old-fashioned, unapologetic, card-carrying liberal. But that in
itself is so rare nowadays in the electronic media that serious
leftists are in a state of shock and disbelief.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very unusual decision," said Peter Hart, co-host of
"CounterSpin," a weekly radio program produced by Fairness and
Accuracy in Reporting, a nonprofit organization that watches the
media for right-wing bias. "What will be interesting to see is what
kind of audience response [Donahue's program] gets. It could be a
breakthrough for the left on American television."</LD>
<TE>   FAIR is founded in part on the notion that the left typically gets
the short end of the media stick. Some people--including perhaps
former CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg, author of "Bias," a
bestseller that charges rampant liberal prejudice among the major
networks' news divisions--may dispute that. But the apolitical
numbers are pretty clear: Conservative commentators in the Rush
Limbaugh vein dominate talk radio from coast to coast, and the cable
news revolution has steered the balance of TV punditry starboard as
well.</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly may see himself as a "no-spin" gadfly, not a
conservative, but it's not feminists, tree-huggers and social-justice
crusaders who have made him the biggest drawing card in cable news.
His "O'Reilly Factor" is on FNC twice a night, Monday through
Saturday. Conservative Alan Keyes can be heard nightly on MSNBC,
while CNBC also has given the Wall Street Journal's editorial board
its own weekly show.</TE>
<TE>   Political southpaws, meanwhile, can count FNC's weekend "News-
watch," which includes FAIR founder Jeff Cohen in its panel of four;
Bill Moyers' weekly half-hour on PBS; and two of the political
pugilists on CNN's "Crossfire."</TE>
<TE>   Except FAIR doesn't consider "Crossfire's" latest nominal
liberals, veteran Democratic Party strategists James Carville and
Paul Begala, properly credentialed leftists at all. "Begala and
Carville are guys who got Bill Clinton elected," Hart said. "They're
centrists. They're even further from the left than [their
predecessor] Bill Press."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Colmes, the left-leaning half of FNC's "Hannity &amp; Colmes"
duo, gets no better marks. "He's probably a bit more liberal than
Begala or Carville," Hart said. "He's also a whole lot less forceful.
He tends to sit back. Sean Hannity dominates that show."</TE>
<TE>   Why there are so few truly leftist commentators on TV--people who
might challenge fundamental assumptions of our economic system and
our lifestyle and broaden the national conversation--is hard to
pinpoint. It's not as though liberals have dwindled to a tiny
minority--remember, half the people who voted in the 2000
presidential election, give or take a few, sided with the Democrat.
But they apparently don't have the same urge to have their beliefs
reinforced--or dittoed--on a daily basis as some conservatives do.</TE>
<TE>   Hart believes that the corporate ownership of TV and radio is a
factor. "Media owners don't want to hear that message articulated
very often," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he also acknowledges that the left simply hasn't produced TV
or radio personalities as commanding and entertaining as Limbaugh and
O'Reilly. He mentioned former Texas agriculture commissioner Jim
Hightower, whose syndicated radio show never caught on, and
filmmaker-provocateur-author Michael Moore ("Roger &amp; Me," "Stupid
White Men") as possible candidates, but it's hard to imagine either
of them doing a nightly show.</TE>
<TE>   Hart noted that liberal-progressive magazines like In These Times
and the Nation might be a good place to find potential TV stars, but
he also pointed out that there's "no infrastructure to develop that
on the left."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why Phil Donahue, 66, is suddenly, bizarrely, the Great
White-Haired Hope of both the American left and a cable network owned
by General Electric. They both need a recognizable, articulate
entertainer to improve their respective competitive edges.</TE>
<TE>   Politics make for strange bedfellows, commerce stranger still.</TE>

<LD>   Latin Grammys Opt for Los Angeles Again</LD>
<LD>   The Latin Grammy Awards ceremony--the target of political protests
last year when the show tried to move to Miami--will stay in Los
Angeles this year, the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences announced Thursday. The third annual event will be held
Sept. 18 at Hollywood's new Kodak Theatre, site of this year's Oscar
awards.</LD>
<TE>   Seemingly cursed in 2001, the fledgling awards show was pulled out
of Miami because Michael Greene, the academy's president and chief
executive, said planned protests by Cuban exiles posed too great a
threat to guests. Moved back to L.A. at the last minute, the show was
ultimately canceled due to the attacks of Sept. 11, the day it was
scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Greene said Thursday that the political climate was still not
right for a move to Miami, headquarters of the Latin music industry.
He has been talking to officials there, however, and leaves the door
open for next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of us were ready to go down that road for
2002," Greene said. "If we ever go down to Miami, we're going to make
sure it will be a community-embraced event. Once burned, it's your
fault. Twice burned, it's my fault."</TE>
<TE>   Two new award categories have been added this year: best
contemporary tropical album and best Christian album, bringing the
total to 41. The show will be televised nationally by CBS and
distributed to 130 countries.</TE>

<TE>   Jewel Injured in Horseback Accident</TE>
<TE>   Pop singer Jewel broke her collarbone and her first rib when she
was thrown from a colt Wednesday at the Texas ranch of her boyfriend,
rodeo star Ty Murray.</TE>
<TE>   Though Jewel (whose full name is Jewel Kilcher) will not be
hospitalized, she will need to wear a collar and a sling for at least
four weeks. She had been scheduled to begin a European tour in Italy
on May 10. That's likely to be canceled, but the singer is expected
to proceed with her U.S. tour, due to begin June 14 in Tampa, Fla.</TE>

<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Warrant Issued for Art Critic Hughes</TE>
<TE>   An arrest warrant has been issued in Australia for Time magazine
art critic and broadcaster ("The Shock of the New") Robert Hughes,
after he failed to appear in court to face charges of dangerous
driving, BBC News reports.</TE>
<TE>   The charges arose from a 1999 crash in which Hughes was nearly
killed. His rental car collided with another vehicle in western
Australia, leaving him in a coma for five weeks. Three occupants of
the other car were also hurt, one seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes issued a statement in New York, where he lives, saying the
injuries he sustained were still serious and prevented him from
making the long trip.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest warrant, issued in Perth, is only effective in that
part of Australia. The court set another hearing date of July 4 to
allow Hughes time to return.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Hughes' wrecked car went on display in an art gallery
in Perth.</TE>

<TE>   Gilmore Award Goes to Polish Hungarian</TE>
<TE>   The Gilmore Artist Awards are the classical-music equivalent of
TV's "The Millionaire," doling out money to unsuspecting recipients.
Unlike most competitions in which artists vie for the prize, the
Gilmore committee travels the world and secretly evaluates pianists
who are unaware they've been nominated.</TE>
<TE>   This year's winner is Polish Hungarian pianist Piotr Anderszewski.
He will be handed a check for $300,000 ($50,000 in cash and $250,000
for a career-related project of his choice)--one of the more
lucrative awards in classical music. Past winners have used the money
to buy a new piano, commission new music or embark on a recording
project.</TE>
<TE>   Anderszewski, 33, who records exclusively for Virgin, will make
his debut as a Gilmore Artist at the 2002 Keyboard Festival in
Kalamazoo, Mich., which opens Saturday and continues through May 11.
The prize is named for the late Irving S. Gilmore, a Kalamazoo
businessman and keyboard enthusiast.</TE>

<TE>   Tylenol Ad a Conflict of Interest for ABC Doctor</TE>
<TE>   ABC News medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman may be getting
a headache from a Tylenol radio commercial she recorded in February,
according to USA Today.</TE>
<TE>   Narrating a commercial is a violation of ABC's ethics rules for
journalists. Snyderman acknowledged the mistake, conceding that she
"didn't use the best judgment in the case."</TE>
<TE>   Though such breaches of company policy generally result in
suspension, ABC insiders think that punishment is unlikely because
she delivered her mea culpa so quickly.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Thomas Friedman will host a
series of documentaries on the Discovery Channel, beginning next
year.... Dick Wolf ("Law &amp; Order") and Studios USA are developing a
prime-time remake of the classic cop series "Dragnet," to run at the
earliest in 2003, Variety reports. No network deal is yet in
place.... Craig Kilborn, host of CBS' "The Late Late Show With Craig
Kilborn," has signed on for another two years.... Singer Jerry Lee
Lewis and his wife, Kerrie, announced they will divorce but will
continue their business relationship.... The opening date for buying
tickets to the Sept. 21 B.B King Blues Festival at the Santa Barbara
Bowl has been changed from Saturday to May 4.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is something tantalizingly elusive about the
objects--sculptures, photographs and videos--in Roman Signer's
current exhibition of recent work. Though presented on their own
terms (not merely as documentation), each seems to reflect the
essence of a piece rather than embodying it entirely.</LD>
<LD>   This essence--and Signer's true medium--is the event: the
ephemeral instant of interaction between two or more carefully chosen
items: a bullet and a tabletop, a kayak and a gravel road, a heater
and a block of ice. The Swiss artist's approach to the dynamics of
the event, refined over several decades, is characterized by a
Zen-like lucidity. Composed with simple, elemental items, a clean
aesthetic and a dry sense of humor, each work resonates with the
spare potency of haiku.</LD>
<TE>   Many of the works hinge upon a moment of impact or explosion. In
one video, for example, 100 grapefruit-sized iron balls, hanging from
the ceiling of a gallery in a symmetrical grid, fall simultaneously
into an equal number of soft clay bricks--a spectacularly noiseless
sight. (Several of the clay-embedded balls are installed individually
nearby.) Another quiet gesture of violence is contained in a
sculpture called "Shot (Schuss)" (2002), which consists of a simple
wood table with a jagged hole at the center, made, on some previous
occasion, by a bullet shot through a curved metal tube that is
affixed to the underside of the table.</TE>
<TE>   Other works explore duration and the anticipation of collapse: a
hot iron in a video slowly burns through the top of a wooden crate as
it floats in a body of water; an oil barrel balances precariously on
an inflated balloon that's been stuffed between the rungs of a tilted
ladder. Installed directly in the gallery, this last piece makes the
possibility of collapse an ever-present threat.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most memorable works in this thorough and wonderfully
satisfying exhibition--one of the few exhibitions of his work yet to
be mounted in the United States--is "Two Wheels (Zwei Ra der)"
(2002), which consists of a tall industrial fan positioned so that
its wind circulates a bicycle tire affixed to a wall. Though almost
laughably simple, the perfect alignment of the piece exemplifies the
peculiar but rather beautiful logic of Signer's style--a style that
moves beyond self-congratulatory cleverness in search of perfect
alignment, however transient.</TE>

<TE>   Yamamoto Leaves Space for Imagination to Enter</TE>
<TE>   The title of Japanese artist Masao Yamamoto's current exhibition
of photographs, his first in Southern California, is "Nakazora," a
Buddhist term that means "empty air" or "the space between sky and
earth." The title, at least in translation, aptly characterizes the
refined sense of spaciousness that pervades both Yamamoto's images
and his method of installation.</TE>
<TE>   The images are fragmentary, poetic and occasionally abstract. Most
depict landscapes and natural subjects; when human beings appear,
their presence is minimal. It is a quiet, muted and very delicate
world, stewing in a sense of meditation and personal reverie. Color
is employed sparingly but wisely; soft sepia and gray tones
predominate.</TE>
<TE>   There are hundreds of images in all--most snapshot-sized or
smaller (some are only an inch or two wide)--and the majority are
fixed directly to the walls in scattered arrangements that resemble
frozen swarms of sepia-toned butterflies. The personal scale and
elegant arrangements bring out the best in the images, lending each
the quality of a tiny treasure.</TE>
<TE>   Framed groupings of three or four pictures in another room are
considerably less striking; while the juxtapositions are intelligent,
the works feel prefabricated--as though for easy sale--and the images
are stifled by the artificial confines of the frame.</TE>
<TE>   For its overall effect, the work relies unabashedly on the
romanticism of the aging photograph: Each image is conscientiously
manipulated to look handled, with creases and tattered edges to match
the dusty tones.</TE>
<TE>   While the same tendency might have led a lesser artist down the
road of greeting card sentimentality, Yamamoto's eye for clear,
intelligent beauty ultimately prevails. There are simply no dull
images, and many that are nearly perfect: a very faint wisp of cloud
that resembles a ballerina; a gaggle of geese silhouetted against a
yellowing sky; a single orange flower and a corner of blue curtain
against a wall of glowing white.</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame that the real world isn't always this lovely.</TE>

<TE>   Mallmann Moves Toward Light at End of the Tunnel</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement explaining the genesis of his new series of
paintings, Arturo Mallmann describes entering a house that was built
into the side of a mountain in a remote village in Morocco. Inside,
he found himself following a corridor that led deep into the earth;
it grew darker, cooler and more ominous as he progressed until, he
says, "I became afraid that if I kept walking I was going to be
erased from existence."</TE>
<TE>   If Mallmann's journey to Morocco inspired the series as a
whole--fragments of his photographs from the trip emerge from time to
time, preserved beneath his thick, glassy paint-like relics--it is
this moment of anxiety in the corridor that seems to structure all of
the individual works. Some version of the proverbial light at the end
of the tunnel--the light Mallmann likely encountered when he began to
move out of the corridor--glows at the center of every painting,
while blackness creeps in ominously around the edges.</TE>
<TE>   The works are heavy, dark and earnestly expressionistic. The
compositions are, at their best, very simple: Most involve some sort
of passageway or alley and a draped, roughly hewn figure or two,
occasionally in the company of a burro or camel. In the smaller works
(around 20-by-15 inches), this arrangement elicits a compelling
intensity. The depth of field, though sketchily conveyed, is pointed
and daunting. A genuine sense of spiritual awe reverberates through
the fluid paint, and one understands Mallmann's fear of disappearing:
The darkness is thick and viscous, the light celestial.</TE>
<TE>   The larger works lose some of this focused intensity. In
attempting to incorporate the space, Mallmann spreads his
compositional tricks thin and inadvertently sacrifices the sense of
mystical abstraction. The loose articulation of the figures is also
less persuasive on a larger scale; they seem not so much spirit-like
as simply unformed.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the conviction behind the series is commendably sincere
and leaves one longing for a journey of one's own.</TE>

<TE>   Tevis Invites Viewer to Look Through Porthole</TE>
<TE>   In a body of recent prints on view at Goldman Tevis, Tom Baldwin
has abandoned his standard rectangular format to explore the
proportions of the circle. In the porthole-like prints that result,
Baldwin's characteristic fragments of free-floating color seem to
have found a new center of gravity.</TE>
<TE>   The works come in two diameters--123/4 inches and 30 inches--and
line opposite walls in even rows. The smaller of these--ink-jet
prints made in collaboration with Gilbert Bretterbauer--are
characterized by a compelling sense of exploration. Flat, generic
forms such as disks, squares, stripes and floral shapes jostle cozily
within the format, as if searching for an optimal balance. The colors
are bold and happily artificial (baby blues, corals, hot pinks, deep
purples and greens ranging from lime to olive). The compositions are
tight and energetic.</TE>
<TE>   The larger works lack the taut dynamism of the smaller--the
centrifugal force loosens its hold and the shapes float more
haphazardly--but convey instead a pleasant element of disintegration.</TE>
<TE>   Their colors are softer--half of the works are dominated by warm
reds, oranges and tans, while the other half tends toward blues--and
the shapes more varied.</TE>
<TE>   The inclusion of five photographs depicting the lush greenery of a
park or nature preserve--agreeable if unspectacular photographs in
their own right--seems at first idiosyncratic, even unnecessary, but
ultimately supports the show's explorative mood.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the series as a whole feels a little like a walk in the
park; where the path leads is not so important as the shapes and
colors one encounters along the way.</TE>

<HD>KXLU Fund-Raiser Razes Roof</HD>
<DH>The station's shindig at Knitting Factory pulses with
variety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio station KXLU-FM (88.9) took over the Knitting Factory on
Wednesday for its "Fundrazor" benefit, which featured a wide-ranging
bill that reflected the eclectic spirit of Loyola Marymount
University's venerable outlet.</LD>
<LD>   At times, many crowded into the club's tiny Alter-Knit Lounge to
see such acts as versatile sonic radicals GoGoGo Airheart and locally
popular rockers the 400 Blows. Others hung out in the bar to see and
be seen while listening to various DJs spin their stuff.</LD>
<LD>   Common threads included the surprisingly far-reaching legacy of
'90s grunge-rockers Mudhoney, whose influence was heard in the
aggressive shrieks of Pleasure Forever as well as in Autolux.
Careening from droning to fierce, the L.A. trio Autolux sculpted an
angular, modern, distorted yet melodic sound that bore the imprint of
the Pixies' sharp alt-pop, and might have made some listeners think
of the psychedelic thrash of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.</LD>
<TE>   Hip-hop was another recurring style in the main room.</TE>
<TE>   The Beat Junkies featured five turntablists, all scratching out
and mixing up at once for a cacophonous, if sometimes tedious, sonic
brew.</TE>
<TE>   Though only marginally more interesting, at least the
Visionaries--whose five socially conscious rappers were backed by the
Junkies' Rhettmatic--worked the usual rap-concert cliches with real
enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   Things ran so far behind schedule in the main room that De Facto,
one of the more anticipated acts, had to truncate its set to 15
minutes rather than the allotted half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   Co-founded by bassist Omar Rodriguez and drummer Cedric Bixler,
who played guitar and sang, respectively, in the now-defunct
indie-rock darling At the Drive-In, the group also featured former
Long Beach Dub Allstars keyboardist Ikey Owens. They didn't have much
time to set a mood, but the spaced-out dub-reggae instrumental groove
they managed to get rolling was pretty cool.</TE>

<HD>Some Humorous Life Lessons Are Shared in 'Other Brother'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Other Brother" is a perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy
about two Harlem brothers (Mekhi Phifer and Andre Blake), one square,
the other hip--or so he thinks. Phifer's Martin has always been a
solid citizen, reliable and courteous, who has a nice townhouse on
the landmark Striver's Row. Blake's Junnie is a player who has a way
with women and is notoriously undependable.</LD>
<LD>   Martin has terrible luck with women, and after the latest has
proved unfaithful, he eventually lets his brother talk him into
teaching him how to be a player. The lessons sink in only too well,
threatening a budding attraction between him and a new neighbor
(Tangi Miller).</LD>
<LD>   Feature-debuting writer-producer-director Mandel Holland and his
crew bring a high professional sheen to "The Other Brother," and
Holland's large cast is attractive and assured, with Phifer
continuing to shine with the star quality evident from his first
screen appearance in Spike Lee's "Clockers." Michele Morgan plays a
loyal but wise ex-girl friend of Junnie's, and Ebony Jo-An is the
brothers' mother, quickly charmed by Junnie even if she can see
straight through him but so swift to depend upon the serious Martin
that she forgets to show him affection and respect. "The Other
Brother" unobtrusively grows more serious as its progresses. The
timelessly beautiful Carmen de Lavallade has a nifty cameo.</LD>
<TE>   Refreshingly, "The Other Brother" shows those parts of Harlem that
rarely make it to the screen--handsome Victorian townhouses and
gracious parks that are the equal of the most charming sections of
Greenwich Village. Cinematographer Matthew Clark not only captures
their beauty but also brings a warm glow to the entire film.</TE>

<HD>Future Shock at the Hand of Slasher Icon Jason</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm really the wrong person to ask why Jason Voorhees and his "Friday
the 13th" series of slasher films have been allowed to live for more
than 20 years. Among such icons of the cinematic abattoir as Norman
Bates and Freddy Krueger, Jason has seemed the least interesting or
imaginative. The hockey mask and elaborate cutlery were shamelessly
ripped off from other, scarier movies. And the whole "Friday the
13th" franchise has been the most persuasive argument against slasher
movies since it exists solely to show how many extravagant ways there
are to eviscerate the human body.</LD>
<LD>   Example: In "Jason X," the 10th in the series and the first since
1993's "Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday," there's one nasty bit
where a pretty blond's face is shoved into a sink full of liquid
nitrogen, frozen solid and smashed like a china tea set. If this gets
your pulse racing, then you are what the producers had in mind when
they decided that Jason needed to be revived for a "new generation."
Why? What did they do?</LD>
<TE>   This live-action cartoon begins in the not-too-distant future
when, having determined that Jason (Kane Hodder) cannot be executed
by any known means, sexy scientist Rowan (Lexa Doig) has decided that
he needs to be put in long-term deep freeze. Somehow, she and the Big
Guy end up in a high-tech refrigerator, only to be thawed in 2455 by
a starship crew that acts as if fashion and lingo have been frozen
since, like, last week.</TE>
<TE>   From there, it's like a dinner-theater version of the "Alien"
movies without the good grooming. One by one, the pert young crew is
slammed, sliced and gutted, each death more numbing and senseless
than the last. Lisa Ryder's bright-eyed android is the only agreeable
diversion.</TE>
<TE>   As for how Jason buys it this time around, all I'll say that if
this doesn't finish him off, nothing will. (Wouldn't you know?
There's yet another cheap opening for more of this junk.) If they've
run out of interesting things to do with Jason, why don't they make
him a goaltender? He's already got the mask.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong horror violence, language and some
sexuality. Times guidelines: If you can't keep your kids from seeing
this kind of movie, have them rent "A Nightmare on Elm Street." At
least it's original--and scary.</TE>

<HD>'Vulgar' Hardly Begins to Describe This Tale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY SHEEHAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those eager few who have been thirsting for a movie about the
homosexual gang rape of a clown need wait no longer. From the
cracking tarmac and peeling paint of a (really, really) depressed New
Jersey suburb comes "Vulgar," an independent effort emanating out of
the circle surrounding writer-director Kevin Smith ("Clerks,"
"Dogma"), who this time out settles for merely executive producing
and, to use the term generously, acting.</LD>
<LD>   The writer-director is Bryan Johnson, who also appears in the film
as the best friend to Will Carlson (Brian Christopher O'Halloran, the
still-appealing star of "Clerks"), a nice young man making a poor
living as a children's party clown named Flappy.</LD>
<LD>   Will's over-showcased kindheartedness has failed to land him many
gigs or even much in the way of common courtesy--either from the
alcoholics who litter his frontyard or, particularly, from his
abusive mother (Jay Petrick), whose nursing-home bills eat up most of
Will's income.</LD>
<TE>   In desperation, Will comes up with a plan. He'll transform himself
into Vulgar, an adult party clown who shows up as a joke "stripper"
in place of the real thing. But his first job turns out to be a ruse.
His employers are a trio of sadists, the foul-mouthed, brutal Ed
Fanelli (Jerry Lewkowitz) and his two deranged sons, the obese
Frankie (Ethan Suplee, an actor often exploited for his appearance)
and skinny Gino (Matt Maher).</TE>
<TE>   To this point, Johnson has mimicked the Smith shooting style: He
backs his camera up against the nearest wall and herds all his actors
into the frame, no matter how awkwardly (the movie was shot in 16mm
and blown up to 35mm).</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, actors adjust their loud line readings to the proximity
of the microphone rather than to the expressive needs of a scene.
Given the tin-eared dialogue, this isn't the drawback it might have
been.</TE>
<TE>   During the rape scene, though, Johnson suddenly evokes memories of
low-budget masters of the past. He uses distorting lenses, quick
cuts, smart set-ups; even the dialogue is miked better. What you're
watching, though, is awesomely coarse. Careful use of the off-screen
space keeps the sexual abuse from being too visually graphic. But the
family rapists describe what they will do and have done in the most
obscene language imaginable and then coerce Will into repeating it.
The improved technique may attract you, a little, but this action
repulses you, a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson does seem to have some psycho-sexual ax to grind amid all
this visual and sexual crudity. For instance, women barely figure in
the action, with Will taking on various stereotypical feminine
attributes. But good luck finding meaning in all this mess.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: Two scenes of sadomasochistic,
homosexual rape, including graphic moments of degradation and verbal
abuse.</TE>

<HD>A 'Vanya' That Glows With Humor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Kathleen Foley; David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who has ever doubted that a Chekhov play can be a categorical
hoot should rush to see "Uncle Vanya" at the Met.</LD>
<LD>   Originally workshopped by the Classical Theatre Lab, this "Vanya,"
which played a limited engagement at the Actors' Gang earlier this
year, is simple, streamlined, stripped of all but the most essential
technical rudiments. (Necessarily so, since the production shares the
stage space with Circle X's current offering, "An American Book of
the Dead.")</LD>
<LD>   In the context of this bare-bones physical staging, director Bruce
Katzman devotes his attention to pacing and nuance, bringing forth
Chekhov's evanescent humor with apparent effortlessness. There's a
trick, of course. In Chekhov, every line and gesture must be rooted
in absolute psychological truth. Stress a laugh line, pander for
tears, and the game is lost. The endangered aristocrats of Chekhov's
microcosm are best left capering in comical agony, like exotic
butterflies dancing on the pins that will eventually impale them.</LD>
<TE>   Katzman, who has taught Chekhov workshops from England to
Argentina, understands the depths of dichotomy in Chekhov's work, the
effete earthiness and languid energy that must inform any successful
interpretation. Fortunately, Katzman has assembled a near-perfect
cast that attacks the play with both delicacy and rigor. What results
is very much an actors' production, no-frills and soul-satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Vanya, played with urgent goofiness by Weston Blakesley, must cope
with the skewering new knowledge that his former brother-in-law,
Serebryakov (Orson Bean), is not the academic genius of his
imaginings, but a neurasthenic poseur who has bled his late wife's
estate dry. To make matters worse, Vanya unrequitedly adores Yelyena
(Elizabeth Karr), Serebryakov's much younger wife. Meanwhile, Vanya's
physician friend Astrov (Kevin McCarty) simmers with lust for
Yelyena, while Serebryakov's plain-Jane daughter Sonya (Barbara Lee
Bragg) adores the oblivious Astrov from afar.</TE>
<TE>   And so the roundelay goes. The virile McCarty interacts with
Karr's fast-melting ice maiden to sizzling effect. Despite some line
flubs, Bragg delivers a full-bodied Sonya, a far cry from the typical
milquetoast interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   An especially effective Bean plays his buffoonish character cut
and dried and close to the bone--and is all the more hilarious for
that. The cast includes Alexander Well, Nancy Jeris, Sara Shearer and
Rob Kendt, all impressive in lesser roles.</TE>

<TE>   "Uncle Vanya," the Met Theatre, 1089 N. Oxford Ave., L.A. Sundays,

<TE>   Archibald MacLeish's 'J.B.'  Gets a Striking Revival</TE>
<TE>   Potent theatricality has always overridden the textual pretensions
of "J.B.," and so it proves in the current Buffalo Nights production.
Though Archibald MacLeish's 1959 Pulitzer Prize-winning retelling of
the Book of Job has nothing on King James, director Brian Kite and
his exuberant company achieve considerable impact.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish's verse drama utilizes a circus setting, placing two
clowns (Gibson Frazier and Marco Sanchez) in the roles of God and
Satan, who wreak havoc upon the title character (Michael Goorjian) in
successive vignettes, interrupted by an off-stage prompter (voiced by
Victor Garber) of metaphysical import.</TE>
<TE>   Kite's energetic staging is thankfully light-handed, deftly
offsetting the author's plummy excesses from interactive pre-show
roustabouts (Jeff Maynard, Maury Sterling and Kevin Weisman) to the
quietly hopeful finale.</TE>
<TE>   Frazier's Jehovah figure, mercurial rather than stentorian, is
remarkable, recalling Roddy McDowall. As his opposite number, Sanchez
is equally impressive in his droll, rational malevolence. Goorjian's
touching hero builds to a heart-rending, hollow-eyed climax.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Tucker's understated wife leads an estimable ensemble, with
the various characterizations of Maynard, Sterling and Weisman almost
stealing the show.</TE>
<TE>   The physical production is striking, with Kristen McCarron's unit
set, Kara McLeod's witty costumes, Craig Pierce's superb lighting and
Craig Wolynez's expert sound creating a surreal, Fellini-esque arena.
Such integrity renders the inevitable post-9/11 analogies acute, and
distinguishes this exceptional revival.</TE>

<TE>   The Laughs Enrich 'Divine Treasure'</TE>
<TE>   Now a U.S. resident, Cuban-born playwright Raul de Cardenas taps
into the vicissitudes of aging and the frustrations of assimilation
in his cheerful but somewhat simple-minded comedy, "Divine Treasure
of Youth" at the Bilingual Foundation of the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   The story revolves around Juan (Don Potter, alternating with
Hecmar Lugo in the Spanish-speaking cast), an elderly Cuban immigrant
who came to the U.S. on a raft. Now living in Brooklyn with his son
and his wife, Juan feels increasingly displaced when his grandson
brings home his pregnant girlfriend, stretching their extended family
to the breaking point. But when Juan moves to his other son's
apartment in Yonkers, he falls afoul of his demanding
daughter-in-law, who eventually orders him out of the house.</TE>
<TE>   Rejected by the local mission, Juan takes to the streets. But he
doesn't stay homeless long. Never mind that he is indigent and, as we
learn, impotent as well. An attractive and financially independent
widow soon offers him a warm heart and a bed.</TE>
<TE>   That falsely feel-good happy ending stretches believability to the
breaking point. However, there are enough laughs and sheer energy in
this good-natured play to compensate for the plot holes. Director
Ernesto Miyares, who also translated the piece, goes for the obvious
in his staging, and that's mostly to the good. The slightly
heightened delivery serves the comic rhythms well.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Nesme, who plays Juan's twin sons, Kiko and Cuco, has the
right style down cold, as does Goreti Da Silva (alternating with Ana
Alfonso) as Juan's comically affected daughter-in-law, Mireya. Diana
De Barros is adorable as a pregnant teenager whose candid chatter
about sex flabbergasts her Old World father-in-law-to-be.</TE>
<TE>   The problem in the English-speaking production is Potter in his
crucial comic role. Although pleasingly puckish, Potter stumbles over
virtually every line, a nerve-racking experience for the audience, as
it must be for his fellow performers. Potter's all-too-obvious
struggle, and the bag of actor's tricks he employs as stalling
devices, badly tarnish this "Treasure."</TE>

<HD>The New World, as Told by a Czech</HD>
<DH>It's true. Dvorak did indeed write the most famous American
symphony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dvorak in America Festival, the second installment in what
Pacific Symphony promises will be an annual examination of American
music, culminated Wednesday at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center with the most famous "American" symphony. That Dvorak's
Symphony No. 9 ( "From the New World") is the best known symphony
written in this country is not open to question. But one object of
this festival has been to delve into just what it means to write
American music and, in this case, whether a score written in the 19th
century German style by a Czech composer really could be called an
American symphony.</LD>
<LD>   The festival's artistic advisor Joseph Horowitz and UC Santa
Barbara Dvorak scholar Michael Beckerman devised illuminating and
entertaining arguments that it is, indeed, possible. In the end, at
least one listener still heard the beloved symphony as a romantic
idealization of an America that never existed rather than as a true
work of the American spirit. But even so, the passionate advocacy
worked to the music's advantage, inspiring performers and audience
alike. The evening ended with a thrilling performance of the "New
World" Symphony conducted by Carl St.Clair, that had the Pacific
Symphony playing at its peak and that encouraged us to hear familiar
music anew.</LD>
<TE>   Dvorak wrote the "New World" during the first of the three years
he spent teaching in New York. As a nationalist in his own country,
he was plainly interested in all aspects of native music, and his
"American" symphony plainly makes apparent his enthusiasm for the
Native American and African American music he encountered here. He
also stated that parts of Longfellow's "The Song of Hiawatha"
inspired the Largo and Scherzo movements of the symphony.</TE>
<TE>   Following up on the poetic references, Beckerman created a
"Hiawatha Melodrama," in which passages from Longfellow's poem were
read by the actor Francis Guinan as the orchestra performed
selections from the symphony's last three movements. The texts were
cleverly selected and, sure enough, the Scherzo's opening timpani
strokes stood in nicely for the tom-toms accompanying the poem's
dancing warriors. The bird song in the Largo was suitably evoked by
Longfellow's pecking and fluttering jays and magpies, thrushes and
blackbirds.</TE>
<TE>   To further set the mood, during the performance of the full
symphony, slides of American period paintings were projected to
illustrate the inner movements. The sad tune of the Largo goes well
with sentimental tributes to a dying race, as it does with languorous
views of plantations, and probably hundreds of other scenes. The
slide show was a good one, although the stage light was not darkened
enough to make it particularly effective. What made a fine effect,
though, was the lowering of the house lights during opening wind
chords of the Largo, allowing the music to take us off into distant
lands.</TE>
<TE>   But it was nonetheless hard to hear the so-called American
"accent" in the music. Some of the thematic material may be of
American origin, but the use of it is purely European. And the real
value of the "New World" is its ability to transcend Longfellow, who
doesn't have many readers these days beyond the occasional
politically incorrect parents who may still read their kids to sleep
with the sentimental verse. No amount of imagery will change the fact
that Indians dance, in the Scherzo, to music that is a direct tribute
to Beethoven.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Czech view is to see this symphony as an expression of
homesickness. Given the problematic influence this symphony had on
those insecure American composers who used it as a manual on how to
write American music, the Czech view is one many Americans these days
are also glad to embrace. St.Clair conducted the symphony like an
American, happy to accept the surface for what it is--hard edges,
sharply defined rhythms and lots of dramatic outbursts, and that
created the sense of freshness. On the other hand, European
conductors often give the score a more introspective, elegiac tinge.</TE>
<TE>   The first half of the concert demonstrated something of the
American musical life Dvorak encountered and maybe helped explain why
his example was so powerful. The best reason today to hear Victor
Herbert's trite Cello Concerto No. 2 is to demonstrate how much
better suited the German emigre would be to the operettas he later

<HD>Careering Into Romance</HD>
<DH>Though a bit retro in its treatment of the love versus job
conflict, 'Life or Something Like It' benefits from the chemistry of
its stars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the amiably glossy if naggingly old-fashioned Hollywood romantic
comedy "Life or Something Like It," Angelina Jolie's Lanie Kerrigan,
a Seattle newscaster, declares that her life is perfect. She loves
her job, has a fiance (Christian Kane) who is a famous baseball
player--and now she has a chance at a network slot that will make her
a nationwide celebrity. That is, if she lives long enough to land it.</LD>
<LD>   A cocky, independent cameraman (Edward Burns) has maneuvered her
into interviewing Prophet Jack (Tony Shalhoub, bearded and shaggy), a
street character who predicts (a) how tonight's football game will
turn out, (b) that there will be hailstones tomorrow and (c) that she
will be dead within the week. Shaken but dismissive, Lanie is a
little nervous when Jack proves right as to the winner of the big
game, then gets plenty scared when hailstones hit Seattle the next
day. Burns' Pete, who doesn't hesitate to tell Lanie that she is the
most delusional, self-involved, self-absorbed woman he has ever met,
suggests that she might avoid Jack's dire prediction if she changes
the kind of person she is.</LD>
<TE>   Writers John Scott Shepherd and Dana Stevens and director Stephen
Herek are clever in the way they play out Lanie's fate, which, not
surprisingly, finds her discovering that her baseball star lover
seems pretty simple in contrast to the wise and witty (and sexy and
handsome) Pete. Lanie has taken her blond glamour look from Marilyn
Monroe but lacquered it over and poured her gym-toned body into
tight, high-style Dolce &amp; Gabbana power suits.</TE>
<TE>   Pete manages to reach--or so it seems--the real woman beneath the
sleek veneer, so Lanie just might stave off imminent mortality.
Ultimately, the film turns on the old love versus career conflict,
and as a result it seems a bit sexist. It's hard not to believe that
if it were Pete who had a shot at the big time that the filmmakers
might not insist so strongly that a man would have to make Lanie's
choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Life or Something Like It" is an adroit crowd-pleaser, and Jolie
and Burns exude charisma and the right chemistry, with Stockard
Channing in a terrific take on a veteran media star who is Lanie's
idol. But the film has a distinct retro undertow, and its point of
view toward women is, if anything, a step back from those Rosalind
Russell career girl movies of the '40s.</TE>

<HD>PAX Offers an Interminable 'Error'</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A disgruntled cyber-hacker with a serious appetite for destruction
sets his sights on ultimate revenge tonight in the almost comically
dramatic TV movie "Terminal Error" (8 p.m., PAX).</LD>
<LD>   Timothy Busfield ("thirtysomething") plays bad guy Elliott Nesher
by, essentially, channeling Microsoft's Bill Gates, complete with a
sweaty mop of hair, dweebish eyeglasses and omnipresent smirk.</LD>
<LD>   Nesher, bounced from his partnership in a software powerhouse
called AutoCom, privately declares war not only on the company's
chief executive, Brad Weston ("Finding Forrester's" Michael Nouri)
but also on the fictional California city where AutoCom is based and
on technology in general.</LD>
<TE>   Nesher's diabolical idea is to slip a virus into the computer
system at AutoCom headquarters, which will enable him to spread his
lethally disruptive plan throughout the company's global network,
from the hometown's traffic-signal system to a nuclear plant in the
Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot to chew on for a 93-minute movie and, this being the
PAX channel ("the family entertainment broadcast network"), Weston's
wife (Marina Sirtis) and son (Matthew Ewald) have bull's-eyes on
their foreheads as well. Before long, all three Westons are running
for their lives--but as a family.</TE>
<TE>   As the movie wears on, its rather interesting nugget of a concept
begins unraveling with the precision of a computer program, with each
scene in the last half hour more ludicrous than the previous one.</TE>
<TE>   By the end, when the family's fractious internal chemistry has
been healed by shared experience against the forces of evil, any
viewers who are still tuned in may breathe a sigh of relief--for
themselves more than for the Westons.</TE>

<HD>Aetna Shares Rise 13% on Medical Plan Gains</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Second-biggest U.S. health insurer reports
$64.9-million operating profit as principal division jumps back into
the black.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aetna Inc. shares rose 13% after the second-biggest U.S. health
insurer said its medical plans showed their first profit in a year
and a half.</LD>
<LD>   The Hartford, Conn.-based company posted a net loss of $2.83
billion, or $19 a share, including a $2.97-billion noncash charge,
mostly for the write-down of the value of past acquisitions, compared
with a loss of $48.2 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Before special items, Aetna's profit rose to $64.9 million, or 44
cents a share, from $15 million, or 10 cents a share, a year ago.
Analysts on average expected profit of 3 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue fell to $5.26 billion from $6.43 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna's health-care business had an operating profit of $44.7
million in the first quarter, contrasted with a loss of $72.7 million
a year earlier. The company also operates a group insurance unit and
a pension management business.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Aetna rose $5.93 to $49.91 on the New York Stock
Exchange and helped fuel a broad rally in health insurance stocks,
which have been among this year's biggest gainers on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive John Rowe is raising some premiums more than 20%
and reducing costs to deliver on his promise of profit from
operations this year.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna also is dropping millions of unprofitable customers and
working with doctors to control spending for laboratory and radiology
services.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna expects 2002 profit from operations, excluding the
write-down of acquisitions, of $1.25 to $1.35 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Rowe said he plans to reduce overhead costs by $300 million this
year and won't rule out job cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Premiums are expected to rise 18% this year, ahead of medical cost
increases of 15% to 16%.</TE>
<TE>   The premium increases have helped Rowe drive away unprofitable
business. Membership will fall to 14 million by the end of the year,
from 15 million in the first quarter, Aetna said. Aetna had
17.2million customers at the end of last year.</TE>

<HD>Neupogen Sales Boost Amgen Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amgen Inc. reported a 12% increase in first-quarter profit Thursday,
driven by higher sales of its chemotherapy-related drug, Neupogen.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $340.9 million, or 32 cents a share, from
$304.9 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 12% to
$1.01 billion from $901.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen raised its sales forecast for the year, buoyed by optimism
about Neulasta, a longer-acting treatment for chemotherapy patients.
The drug, a second-generation version of Neupogen, was launched this
month.</LD>
<TE>   Amgen said sales growth in 2002 would be in the low-20% range. The
previous estimate of sales growth in the mid-teens did not reflect
sales of Neulasta, which boosts production of infection-fighting
white blood cells.</TE>
<TE>   However, the updated forecast does not take into account Amgen's
pending $16-billion acquisition of Immunex Corp. Shareholders of both
companies will vote next month on the deal, which is expected to
close by June.</TE>
<TE>   Immunex has run into a series of production problems with Enbrel,
the rheumatoid arthritis drug that drove the Amgen deal. The company
announced this week that an Enbrel factory under construction in
Rhode Island will open later than expected, probably not until the
third quarter of this year. The company lowered its estimate of 2002
Enbrel sales to $900 million from $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen executives, in a conference call with analysts, acknowledged
that the delay could affect their sales projections for Enbrel,
estimated at $1.6 billion in 2003. Amgen executives said they would
not be able to fully assess the situation until after the merger. But
George Morrow, Amgen sales and marketing executive vice president,
said, "Clearly, some assumptions have deteriorated."</TE>
<TE>   Amgen reported that combined sales of anemia drugs Epogen and
Aranesp grew 10% in the quarter to $551 million, up from $503 million
for only Epogen a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Rejects Andersen's Proposal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department rejected a settlement offer that accounting
firm Arthur Andersen made to avoid a trial on an obstruction of
justice charge, a lawyer for the firm said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The rejection was received late in the day, Rusty Hardin said. "We
are now preparing for trial," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Hardin had sent a letter to the Justice Department on Wednesday
restating Andersen's position in the negotiations when talks broke
off last week. Andersen, Enron Corp.'s former auditor, is accused of
destroying documents that might have interested Securities and
Exchange Commission investigators.</LD>
<TE>   Before talks broke off, Andersen had agreed to publicly admit
wrongdoing in the destruction of documents, people familiar with the
matter had said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Andersen, which has lost more than 225 U.S. audit
clients this year, is struggling to stem its disintegration. The
accounting firm agreed Wednesday to sell most of its risk-consulting
business to staffing company Robert Half International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Trial is set for May 6 in Houston. There is a pretrial hearing
planned for today.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times reported Thursday that the Andersen letter
offered fewer concessions than prosecutors were seeking when
settlement talks broke down.</TE>
<TE>   Two federal grand juries are investigating whether fraud
contributed to Enron's collapse in the biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history.</TE>
<TE>   The government's probe of possible criminal wrongdoing at Andersen
has expanded to include Nancy Temple, an Andersen in- house lawyer,
people familiar with the matter said.</TE>
<TE>   Temple sent a memo to Andersen auditors working on Enron's books
in October, reminding them of the firm's document destruction policy.</TE>
<TE>   She has been told she's under criminal investigation by the
Justice Department, the Wall Street Journal reported.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The ever-hotter real estate market helped the nation's two largest
title insurance carriers boost first-quarter earnings and revenue to
record levels for any January-to-March period, usually the slowest
time in the real estate market.</LD>
<LD>   The largest, Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine, more than
doubled its net income to $101million, or $1.14 a share, from last
year's first-quarter profit of $45million, or 52 cents. Revenue rose
41% to $1.1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   First American Corp. in Santa Ana reported net income of
$44.1million, or 57 cents a share, more than double its profit of
$20.6million, or 30 cents, earned in the same period last year.
Revenue grew 30% to $1billion.</LD>
<TE>   "This year has started out as a year driven by robust resale
volumes with interest rates" still at low levels, said Fidelity's
president, Patrick F. Stone.</TE>
<TE>   In other Southern California company earnings:</TE>
<TE>   International Rectifier Corp., an El Segundo-based microchip maker
and power management company, posted a 75% decline in fiscal
third-quarter profit, but said orders jumped as it sold more
proprietary technology products.</TE>
<TE>   Net income fell to $12.2 million, or 19 cents a share, from
$47.9million, or 73 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.
The company's results were in line with forecasts of a 19-cent profit
among analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue dropped to $178.6 million from $276.0 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Corinthian Colleges Inc. said fiscal third-quarter profit rose
55%. The Santa Ana-based operator of more than 60 colleges expects
full-year results will beat analysts' estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Net income rose to $11.1 million, or 50 cents a share, in the
period ended March 31, from $7.2 million, or 33 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 35% to $88.3 million from $65.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Unilab Corp., a Tarzana-based medical testing firm, posted
first-quarter net income of $8.7 million, or 25 cents a share, versus
$3.2million, or 12 cents a share, in the year-ago period.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue rose to $103.9million from $95.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   * OSI Systems Inc., a Hawthorne-based seller of
optoelectronic-based components and systems, posted fiscal
third-quarter net income of $2.3 million, or 17 cents a share, versus
$329,000, or 4 cents, a year ago. Revenue rose to $32.1 million,
versus $29.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Guitar Center Inc., a Westlake Village-based retailer, posted
net income of $3.4 million, or 15 cents a share, down from $5
million, or 22 cents, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose to $251.5
million, versus $213.2 million a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Apria Healthcare Group Inc., a Lake Forest-based operator of
home health-care services and products, posted net income of
$23million, or 41 cents a share, for the first quarter, an increase
from $17.1 million, or 31 cents a share, in the same period a year
ago. Quarterly sales rose 11% to $301.3million.</TE>
<TE>   Apria also said it has hired Lawrence A. Mastrovich as chief
operating officer. Mastrovich left the company a year ago to become
president and chief operating officer of TechRx Inc.</TE>
<TE>   * New Century Financial Corp., an Irvine-based specialty mortgage
banking company, reported that first-quarter profit climbed to
$30.9million, or $1.21 a share, contrasted with a net loss of
$2.6million, or 17 cents, a year ago. Revenue more than doubled to
$112.3million from $48 million.</TE>
<TE>   * RemedyTemp Inc., an Aliso Viejo-based staffing company, said
second-quarter net income fell 93% to $191,000, or 2 cents a share,
for its fiscal second quarter ended March 31.</TE>
<TE>   It earned $2.7 million, or 30 cents, for the same quarter a year
ago. Revenue declined 18% to $106.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Sicor Inc., an Irvine-based pharmaceutical company, said
first-quarter profit doubled to $22.5million, or 19 cents a share,
from $11.9 million, or 11 cents, in the same period a year ago.
Revenue increased 30% to $109.6million.</TE>

<HD>Chrysler on Profitable Track</HD>
<DH>Autos: The unit posts $111-million operating profit, ending
six quarters of losses, and says it should at least break even this
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>In a sign that its far-reaching turnaround plan is starting to bear
fruit, Chrysler Group on Thursday reported an operating profit of
$111 million in the first quarter and said it was on track at least
to break even this year.</LD>
<LD>   The profit, on revenue up 11% to $13.9 billion, marked a dramatic
about-face from the $1.2-billion operating loss that Chrysler
Group--made up of the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands--suffered in
the first quarter a year ago and ended six consecutive quarters of
red ink.</LD>
<LD>   Chrysler Group does not report net earnings, but its parent,
DaimlerChrysler of Germany, took a $300-million charge for
restructuring at its U.S. unit that is the former Chrysler Corp.</LD>
<TE>   "We were able to further overachieve on the cost side," Chief
Executive Dieter Zetsche told journalists at Chrysler Group's
headquarters in this Detroit suburb. "The company is better than we
thought a half-year ago."</TE>
<TE>   Stuttgart-based DaimlerChrysler had an operating profit of $900
million for the quarter, up from a loss of $500 million a year
earlier. On a net basis, DaimlerChrysler earned $2.3 billion, or
$2.31 a share, boosted by the sale of an information technology and
telecommunications subsidiary, virtually a mirror image of
DaimlerChrysler's net loss of $2.1 billion, or $2.05 a share, in the
first quarter of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Zetsche said Chrysler's turnaround was on track despite
uncertainties in the domestic economy, the war on terrorism and
violence in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "Assuming the economy continues to develop positively, Chrysler
may do better than break even and show a profit for the full year,"
Zetsche said.</TE>
<TE>   He cited strong sales in the quarter of the completely redesigned
Dodge Ram pickup truck--launched at the worst possible time, one week
after the September attacks, when vehicle sales were at a virtual
standstill--and the Jeep Liberty sport utility vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chrysler story was definitely good news," said Ephraim Levy,
an auto industry analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's. But "Chrysler's
story is still one of competition being the No. 1 issue .... The
areas that have been Chrysler's strength remain under pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Rival auto makers have introduced numerous well-received and
competitively priced models in recent years in the market segments in
which Chrysler is traditionally strong: minivans, pickup trucks and
mid-size SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting some support from the overall economic
development, but at the same time the competitive environment is
very, very tough," Zetsche said.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese yen, for instance, has strengthened 28% against the
U.S. dollar since January 2000, giving Japanese auto makers a
significant price advantage in the American market, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler's U.S. sales fell 8% to 542,199 cars and trucks in the
first quarter from 596,811 vehicles in the same period a year
earlier, according to Autodata Corp. Chrysler had a 13.8% share of
the U.S. market in the quarter, down from 14.4% a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler Group had an operating loss of $1.7 billion in the second
half of 2000 because of a bloated cost structure, missteps in product
pricing and intense spending on rebates and other incentives to boost
sales.</TE>
<TE>   The company lost about $2 billion in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In February of last year, Zetsche announced a turnaround plan that
revolved around deep cost cutting and included eliminating 26,000
jobs, slashing dealer subsidies, closing six factories and reducing
production elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Cost cutting is progressing rapidly, Zetsche said. The company
eliminated 20,500 jobs last year, ahead of schedule, and trimmed an
additional 600 last quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "The low-hanging fruits are already harvested. So by addressing
more items, we are able to continue our momentum in this category,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Such actions include reducing reliance on precious metals and
replacing chrome wheels with chrome-plated wheels.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler stock fell 50 cents on Thursday after the earnings
report, closing at $46.09 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Digital TV Copyright Concerns Tentatively Resolved by Group</HD>
<DH>Tech: Broadcast flag embedded in programs would prevent
Internet redistribution, working group tells lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After months of negotiations, a working group of technology and
entertainment companies said Thursday that it has reached a tentative
resolution of one of the key stumbling blocks slowing the roll-out of
high-definition digital television.</LD>
<LD>   At a hearing in Washington, industry leaders told lawmakers that
they were only weeks away from coming up with the final plan to
implement a technology, known as a "broadcast flag," that will
address most of the copyright concerns of television producers.</LD>
<LD>   Entertainment companies have resisted making their programs
available in high-definition television because of concerns that
content would be copied and redistributed via the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   The broadcast flag would be embedded into digital programs sent
over the air. It would permit consumers to make copies of digital
programs, but prevent them from sending copies over the Internet
without permission.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the
Internet praised the private-sector progress and said they saw no
need to step in with a broad government mandate. Several members
criticized a bill pending in the Senate--which was backed by several
Hollywood studios--that calls for the government to resolve the
technological hurdles if they aren't settled within 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe that the best solution is a private-sector
solution," said Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who chairs the
subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   A final agreement is expected by May 17, said Paul F. Liao, chief
technology officer of Panasonic, formally known as Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. Liao is a representative for five major
technology firms in the working group.</TE>
<TE>   One electronics manufacturer, however, called upon Congress to
intervene in the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Philips Consumer Electronics said the working group has been
closed to smaller firms and is not considering alternative
technologies that might stem piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence J. Blanford, president of Philips, also expressed concern
that the technologies will hinder the ability of consumers to make
personal copies of movies and music that they have purchased.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment leaders deny such claims.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to shut down innovation," said Jack Valenti,
president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America. "We just want to
protect private property from being pillaged."</TE>
<TE>   Congress has been pressuring the industries to resolve their
differences to meet a 2006 deadline for television broadcasters to
deliver all programs digitally.</TE>
<TE>   But despite five years of prodding by federal regulators, nearly
three-quarters of the nation's 1,240 commercial television stations
won't meet the government's Wednesday deadline to begin airing
digital TV, according to a report released Thursday by the General
Accounting Office.</TE>
<TE>   The delays--which stem from lack of finances, copyright issues and
TV transmitters destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks--are a setback for
the industry advocates and policymakers who believe the technology
can help create thousands of jobs and boost the economy.</TE>
<TE>   They also are shining an unflattering light on the laissez-faire
policies of Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael K.
Powell, who told broadcasters this month to get on board with digital
TV "or it will run over you." Critics say tougher FCC rules, rather
than tough talk, is what's needed to speed up the digital transition.</TE>
<TE>   Digital TV "still has incredible potential for being a driver of
economic growth and job creation, but its promise has been held back
for far too long due in part to the reluctance of policymakers to
insist forcefully on more progress and to inter-industry jockeying
for advantage," said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), the
telecommunications subcommittee's ranking member.</TE>

<HD>Disclosures Send Dynegy Shares Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a series of disclosures that had echoes of Enron Corp., Dynegy
Inc. reduced earnings estimates Thursday and said the Securities and
Exchange Commission is examining a gas supply transaction--triggering
a 30% decline in its stock.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy said the gas transaction, known as Project Alpha, will
result in a revision of Dynegy's 2001 cash flow statement. The
Houston energy company's stock fell $8.09 to close at $19.21 on the
New York Stock Exchange and brought a warning of a potential credit
downgrade by Moody's Investors Service, the Wall Street debt-rating
firm.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded Dynegy's debt one notch
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Dynegy Chief Executive Chuck Watson said the company remains
strong despite the setbacks, which include $313 million in
first-quarter charges related to the company's unprofitable
telecommunications operation and to unexpected losses at the Northern
Natural Gas pipeline, which Dynegy got from Enron as part of the
failed merger between the two firms.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy said it will meet first-quarter earnings estimates of
$173million, or 41 cents a share, for recurring net income before the
charges are taken into account. For the year, Dynegy lowered its
earnings guidance to $2 to $2.05 a share, down from previous guidance
of $2.26 a share.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is more disappointed than I am right now about some of
these things," Watson said Thursday in a conference call with
analysts and investors.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy over Project Alpha was ignited by a Wall Street
Journal article April 3 that likened the transaction to some of the
special-purpose entities that hastened Enron's downfall. Watson said
it was a legitimate deal that produced $80 million in tax savings
last year, while supplying Dynegy with significant amounts of natural
gas.</TE>
<TE>   The story prompted a request for a meeting by the SEC's accounting
staff as well as a separate informal inquiry by the SEC's Fort Worth
office, he said.</TE>
<TE>   During a meeting last week with SEC accounting and enforcement
staff in Washington, Dynegy executives agreed to change the way the
firm accounted for cash from the transaction in 2001, settling the
SEC's accounting questions, Watson said. He said the inquiry by the
Fort Worth office continues.</TE>
<TE>   The $300 million generated by the transaction in 2001 will be
accounted for as a financing activity rather than an operating
activity, Dynegy said. The restatement will not affect the balance
sheet or the income statement for last year, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors probably overreacted to the news, said Chris Ellinghaus,
an analyst with Williams Capital Group, who has a "buy" rating on
Dynegy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the first energy company to find itself the subject
of an SEC inquiry and it won't be the last," Ellinghaus said. Most of
the companies, including Williams Cos. and Calpine Corp., have seen
their stock rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Howald, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais Securities,
downgraded Dynegy to "add" from "buy" because of uncertainties facing
the company, particularly from the debt rating agencies, which are
holding Dynegy barely above "junk" bond territory.</TE>
<TE>   "An energy marketing and trading company needs an investment-grade
credit rating to be successful," Howald said. "It's a slippery slope
that they're on right now."</TE>

<LD>Walt Disney Co. reported a profit turnaround Thursday for the latest
quarter despite declining income at all four of its business units,
while media rival Viacom Inc. posted a significant loss because of an
accounting write-off related to its Blockbuster Video unit.</LD>
<LD>   But excluding extraordinary items, both companies beat Wall
Street's expectations, despite being hurt in the quarter by a
sluggish economy and a downturn in advertising.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at Disney and Viacom indicated that the advertising
recovery seemed to be underway, and that has helped fuel a run-up in
both stocks so far this year.</LD>
<TE>   Advertising accounts for 50% of revenue at Viacom, which owns the
broadcast CBS and UPN networks; cable channels, including MTV, BET
and Nickelodeon; the Infinity Broadcasting radio group; and an
outdoor billboard unit.</TE>
<TE>   Disney also is advertising-dependent because of its ABC network,
radio and television stations, and cable channels, including ESPN,
Disney Channel and ABC Family.</TE>
<TE>   At Disney, cost cutting helped turn a profit of $259 million, or
13 cents a share, for its fiscal second quarter, ended March 31. That
contrasts with a loss of $567 million, or 26 cents, in the same
quarter last year, when the company wrote off $996 million in costs
for shutting down its Go.com Web site and some retail stores.
Analysts expected earnings of 10 cents a share for the latest
quarter, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's revenue declined 2% to $5.9 billion from $6.05 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Although ABC's declining ratings hurt its television network
division, Disney officials were buoyed by signs of improvement at its
theme parks. President Robert Iger characterized an uptick in
international travel as "gradual rather than dramatic," and said a
shift in strategy at the consumer products division also was starting
to show results.</TE>
<TE>   "The message of the second quarter, as with the first, is that
Disney continues on track," said Disney Chief Executive Michael
Eisner.</TE>
<TE>   At Viacom, a $1.5-billion write-down on the value of Blockbuster
to conform to new accounting rules resulted in a first-quarter loss
of $1.11 billion, or 63 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the accounting change, Viacom earned $367 million in the
quarter, or 21 cents a share, besting Wall Street's estimate of 16
cents a share. A year earlier Viacom earned $354million on the same
accounting basis.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue fell 1% to $5.67 billion from $5.75 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom officials predicted that the yearlong advertising slump had
hit bottom. President Mel Karmazin said Viacom profit would grow at a
double-digit rate for the year. He said TV and radio advertising has
increased recently, after declining by 9% and 4%, respectively, in
the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The bright spot for Viacom was its cable networks, where quarterly
sales increased 5% and cash flow improved by 12% over the previous
year. MTV had its highest-rated first quarter ever among viewers aged
12 to 34, because of the popularity of "The Osbournes," a new reality
show based on musician Ozzy Osbourne's family. Revenue at the
entertainment division, which includes Paramount Pictures and Simon &amp;
Schuster publishing, climbed 7%, and cash flow was up 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom shares closed at $49.81, down 38 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange. Disney shares were up 48 cents to $25 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, electronics and entertainment giant Sony Corp. posted a
lower-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter loss Thursday. But Sony
predicted a strong rebound in profit for this fiscal year because of
brisk sales of its PlayStation 2 video game consoles.</TE>
<TE>   For the quarter ended March 31, Sony posted a loss of $43 million,
contrasted with a profit of $122million a year earlier. Sales fell 2%
to $14.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Sony said its turnaround will get even stronger in the months
ahead and predicted income of $1.2 billion for the fiscal year ending
in March 2003.</TE>
<TE>   For the fiscal year just ended, Sony's profit fell 9% to $119
million, while sales rose 4% to $59 billion.</TE>

<HD>California Median Home Prices Top Record $300,000</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Cost of single-family dwellings surges 19%
from year earlier on short supply and low rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Median home prices in California topped $300,000 for the first time
last month, as tight supplies and low mortgage rates continued to
drive the market.</LD>
<LD>   The median price of a single-family home surged to $305,940, up
nearly 19% from a year earlier, the California Assn. of Realtors said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of existing single-family homes grew 13% in March from a
year earlier, to an annual rate of 586,230, the group said.</LD>
<TE>   Buyers were drawn to the market largely by low mortgage rates and
greater consumer confidence in March, the group said. In addition,
sellers were helped by a diminishing number of available homes,
boosting prices. In tight markets such as Southern California,
multiple bids became more common.</TE>
<TE>   California posted the highest median prices in the nation last
month--exceeding even Hawaii, where the median dropped from $312,800
in February to $299,000 in March, according to industry officials.</TE>
<TE>   The March figures in California were up 2.2% from February. But
escalating prices are keeping more people out of the market for
starter and move-up homes, industry officials noted.</TE>
<TE>   "While it is good news for homeowners," said CRA President Robert
Bailey, "it's a cause for concern as affordability becomes a serious
issue for more and more families in the state."</TE>
<TE>   Absent a marked increase in production statewide, a separate study
sponsored by the Fannie Mae Foundation said people of all income
levels will find fewer options to purchase homes, or will be unable
to afford rental homes without doubling or tripling up at a much
greater rate.</TE>
<TE>   Affordable housing is becoming more scarce nationwide. In March,
the median, or midpoint, price for an existing home was $153,000, a
6.7% increase from a year earlier, according to a report released
Thursday by the National Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Sales nationwide fell 8.3% to an annual rate of 5.4 million units
in March from an upwardly revised pace of 5.89 million units in
February. But combined with record sales earlier this year, the
robust pace during the quarter exceeded the group's forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Low mortgage rates have kept home seekers in the market even as
prices increase, said Martin Edwards Jr., president of the national
real estate agents group, based in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages remained under 7% for
the third week in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Affordability for many buyers remains favorable, Edwards added,
though in certain high-priced markets, the industry needs to focus
more on programs that allow low- and moderate-income renters to
become first-time homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   But in California, those potential buyers and others are squeezed
by an inadequate supply of housing.</TE>
<TE>   Home builders must double their rate of production each year of
this decade in order to fill the state's housing needs, the Fannie
Mae Foundation report said. The conclusion echoes findings from
another study released earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   That study released earlier said that cities and counties should
be exempted from state-mandated requirements to plan for low-income
housing if they allow a certain number of rental and multi-family
units to be built.</TE>
<TE>   The study, by USC demographers Dowell Myers and Julie Park,
suggests that one unintended consequence of state laws designed to
increase the amount of low-income housing is political bickering
among local officials that "has helped turn the spigot off of new
housing construction."</TE>
<TE>   "The housing crisis in California is one of inadequate supply of
all housing, and of multifamily housing in particular, regardless of
the income level of the occupants," Myers said. "Once housing can be
provided in the required volume, price escalation will ease and all
housing consumers will be better off."</TE>
<TE>   But state officials said housing laws are not to blame. "There's
no way we could agree with any assessment that the housing element
process in any way limits or results in inadequate housing
production," said Cathy Creswell, deputy director for the Department
of Housing and Community Development that administer state housing
laws.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires cities to plan for, but not necessarily build,
low- and moderate-income housing. The USC study says local
governments should not be required to complete those plans if they
build a certain number of rental homes, regardless of whether the
units are affordable for low- and moderate-income residents.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would not lead to more luxury housing because the
need for low- and middle-income housing is overwhelming, Myers said.
The report added that new construction could be spurred by cities
receiving a larger fiscal incentive to build housing, and by
restoring federal tax credit subsidies for developers of multifamily
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Except during the years of the Great Depression, the study says
the slow pace of development during the 1990s is unprecedented in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary figures show that 148,300 units were built last year.
The state estimates 220,000 or more new homes are needed annually to
keep pace with growth. The stock of vacant rental and houses is now
virtually depleted, the study says.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Healthcare West, Union Reach Accords</HD>
<DH>Labor: Agreements result from one of the biggest organizing
drives of private-sector health workers in the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After several years of often-contentious organizing and negotiations,
the Service Employees International Union has reached labor contract
agreements with Catholic Healthcare West that cover 9,000 workers at
20 hospitals in California.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, which is to be announced today, is the culmination
of one of the biggest organizing drives of private-sector health
workers in the state. And it comes after a tough campaign that at one
point sparked debate among the national clergy about the Catholic
church's role in labor disputes.</LD>
<LD>   The contracts, which must be ratified by workers, would provide an
overall wage and benefit increase of 10% annually for the two-year
life of the agreement. The union said that the pay increases would
range from 14% to 28% over two years and that all regular workers
would receive new medical insurance fully paid by the employer.</LD>
<TE>   The workers covered include registered and licensed vocational
nurses, respiratory therapists and food service workers at nine
hospitals in Northern California and 11 in Southern California,
including Northridge Hospital Medical Center and St. Mary Medical
Center in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The contracts would establish joint union-management committees to
work out staffing issues, which have been a contentious matter at
many hospitals as they have grappled with a worsening shortage of
nurses. If the committees cannot agree, the issue would go to binding
arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   "It means I have a voice," said Ingela Dahlgren, a registered
nurse at Northridge Hospital who was a member of the bargaining team.
She said she believed these joint committees would ultimately lead to
improved patient care, by helping address the high turnover and
shortages that sometimes have led to a nurse's overseeing as many as
14 patients at one time.</TE>
<TE>   Amid such conditions, the SEIU and the California Nurses' Assn.
have aggressively stepped up their organizing drives in recent years.
SEIU officials called the settlement with Catholic Healthcare West a
breakthrough that would help them in ongoing organizing efforts at
other hospitals in the state. Although employees at Kaiser Permanente
and public health workers are unionized, most in the private sector
are not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a remarkable first contract," said Lisa Hubbard, a
spokeswoman for the SEIU.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Klein, a spokesman for Catholic Healthcare West, the state's
largest not-for-profit hospital system in California, with 38 medical
centers, said that the contract settlement was in the best interest
of employees and patients. He declined to comment about the terms of
the agreement or how the labor contracts would affect the finances of
Catholic Healthcare West.</TE>
<TE>   Based in San Francisco, Catholic Healthcare West is in the middle
of a three-year restructuring plan after coming under significant
financial stress. Over the last decade, many hospitals have been
struggling with dramatic cuts in government reimbursements and
pressure from health insurers as well as work force shortages and the
swelling number of uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   The contract settlements conclude an organizing campaign that
early on was rife with allegations that managers at three Catholic
hospitals were using religious authority to dissuade workers from
joining a union.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations ignited a spirited debate among church activists
and labor supporters. Two of the three hospitals--St. Francis in
Lynwood and Robert F. Kennedy in Hawthorne--are no longer part of
Catholic Healthcare West.</TE>

<HD>HP Trial Wraps Up; Judge Promises Swift Decision</HD>
<DH>Courts: Fiorina explains why she told a big investor that
its vote was important to their "ongoing relationship.''</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WILMINGTON, Del.</DL>
<LD>The courtroom battle to block Hewlett-Packard Co.'s acquisition of
Compaq Computer Corp. came to an end Thursday without a knockout blow
by either side.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor William Chandler III of Delaware's Chancery Court has
ordered each side to submit final briefs by midnight tonight.
Chandler said he expects to rule quickly, although the volume of
materials presented in the three-day trial suggests to some experts
that the opinion may take several days or longer.</LD>
<LD>   Legal experts say the company will almost certainly appeal to the
Supreme Court of Delaware if dissident HP director Walter Hewlett
prevails in his lawsuit to void the merger vote.</LD>
<TE>   Final certification of the proxy vote to confirm the merger is
expected at any time. HP hopes to launch the merged company May 7. It
will conduct a regularly scheduled shareholder meeting today;
Hewlett's term on the HP board also ends today, as HP board members
failed to renominate him.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett's suit claims that HP officials misrepresented key data
about the merger's benefits and hid financial weaknesses from
shareholders and from its own board. It alleges that HP Chief
Executive Carly Fiorina and others used threats and promises of new
business to coerce institutional shareholders, including Deutsche
Bank, to support the merger.</TE>
<TE>   In a dramatic moment Thursday, Hewlett attorney Stephen Neal asked
Fiorina to read from a transcript of her conference call with
Deutsche Bank held early on March 19, the day of a shareholder
meeting at which the merger vote was concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Near the conclusion of the call, Fiorina told Deutsche Bank
officials that the vote "is of great importance to our ongoing
relationship." Minutes later, Deutsche Bank switched some 17 million
of its proxy votes from opposing to favoring the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina's statement was perhaps the closest thing to a smoking gun
in the trial. Neal implied that she had compelled Deutsche Bank to
change its votes by suggesting that future business with the
technology giant could be at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina angrily disagreed. "It's crystal clear from the
transcript" that Deutsche Bank did not interpret her comment as a
threat," she said on the stand. The complete transcript was not
publicly released.</TE>
<TE>   "The relation between persuasion and coercion is a very fine
line," said Charles Elson, director of the Center for Corporate
Governance at the University of Delaware. Chandler's conclusion may
depend on Fiorina's tone and inflection, the rest of what's on the
tape, and the history of HP's relationship with Deutsche Bank, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the trial, some legal experts suggested that Chandler would
use this case to reconsider the legal balance of power between
shareholder rights and corporate prerogatives.</TE>
<TE>   But perceived weaknesses in Hewlett's arguments--reflected in HP's
calling just two defense witnesses, questioned for less than three
hours--and the high standard for invalidating a shareholder vote
makes that prospect less likely, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a narrow ruling," said Reinier Kraakman, professor
of law at Harvard University. "I don't see it as a case that presents
the factual backdrop for a strong ruling on the matters of law."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Palo Alto-based HP rose 17 cents to $17.38 in New York
Stock Exchange trading Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Dollar Slumps on Investor Unease</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Currency's weakness and renewed oil jitters send
gold to two-year high. Dow steadies after early losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dollar slumped Thursday amid growing investor uneasiness over the
speed and strength of the U.S. economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Gold rose to a two-year high, in part on concerns about the
dollar's weakness and on renewed jitters over oil supplies.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks closed mixed on Wall Street, with most indexes little
changed, on fairly heavy volume.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrials gained 4.63 points to 10,035.06, and the
Nasdaq composite inched up from Wednesday's 51/2-month low, adding
0.36 point to 1,713.70.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar took center stage on world markets, falling to a 31/2-
month low against the euro, the Canadian dollar and the British
pound, among other currencies. It also fell to a six-week low against
the Japanese yen.</TE>
<TE>   Recent economic data have been spotty. The government Thursday
said workers' wages and benefits rose at the slowest pace in three
years in the January-to-March quarter. Reports Wednesday showed sales
of new homes slowing and a decline in durable goods orders in March.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows an economy that is in recovery, but it is a tentative
one," said Mark Zandi of Economy.com in West Chester, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   A country's currency typically reflects global investors' faith in
the economy. A strong currency often means foreigners are eager to
buy a country's assets, such as stocks. A weak currency can mean
foreigners are selling those assets and taking their money elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. stocks and bonds don't look particularly good. It just seems
we are in a bit of a period of uncertainty, and it looks like some of
the long-dollar positions are starting to be cut," said Ralph
DelZenero, senior trader at Bank One.</TE>
<TE>   The euro's value rose to 89.8 cents, up from 89.2 cents Wednesday
and the highest since early January.</TE>
<TE>   The yen appreciated to 128.63 per dollar from 129.64 on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although the dollar's weakness so far is not severe--especially
considering how strong the currency has been in recent
years--analysts are concerned because the massive U.S.
current-account deficit shows how dependent the country is on foreign
financing.</TE>
<TE>   In commodity trading, near-term gold futures in New York jumped
$3.80 to $308.10 an ounce, a two-year high. Gold's price is up from
$279 at year-end.</TE>
<TE>   Near-term crude oil futures added 35 cents to $26.73 a barrel
after rising as high as $27.20 on concerns that Saudi Arabia may
threaten to use oil as a weapon to push the U.S. to rein in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, the Dow industrials traded below 10,000 for much
of the day but rallied in the last hour. The index last closed below
10,000 on Feb. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 16 to 15 on the New York Stock Exchange,
though losers had a 19-to-16 edge on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury bond market did not appear shaken by the dollar:
Long-term yields fell, with the 10-year T-note dropping to 5.09% from
5.11% on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Brokerage stocks slumped on fresh concerns about state and
federal investigations of the industry's practices. Merrill Lynch
slid $2.15 to $42.50, Goldman Sachs lost $2.28 to $77.21, and Lehman
Bros. dropped $2.24 to $57.91.</TE>
<TE>   * Some technology stocks rebounded from their recent slide.
Microsoft added 71 cents to $53.73. Corning gained 23 cents to $6.83.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold stocks were mixed despite bullion's gain. Barrick Gold rose
31 cents to $19.51, but Agnico Eagle fell 70 cents to $14.20.</TE>
<TE>   * HMO stocks continued to surge amid strong industry earnings.
WellPoint Health jumped $3.36 to $74.84; UnitedHealth added $1.01 to
$87.</TE>

<HD>Earnings at Major Oil Companies Fall Sharply</HD>
<DH>Energy: Firms cite lower prices, economy. But outlook lifts
shares of Chevron, Unocal, others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Led by ChevronTexaco Corp., several major U.S. oil companies said
Thursday that their first-quarter earnings were battered by lower oil
and gas prices and the worst refining and marketing business climate
since the mid-1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Unocal Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. also posted sharp
earnings declines.</LD>
<LD>   The industry should see a better second quarter, when companies
expect to benefit from a spike in energy commodity prices and higher
retail gasoline prices during the summer driving season.</LD>
<TE>   "We have seen the bottom and are likely to improve significantly,"
said oil company analyst Fadel Gheit of Fahnestock &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco, the nation's second-largest oil
company, posted first-quarter net income of $725 million, or 68 cents
a share, down 70% from net income of $2.43 billion, or $2.29, a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it would have made $931 million, or 88 cents a
share, if not for $132 million in expenses stemming from Chevron's
takeover of Texaco six months ago and a $74-million charge to account
for a setback on its investment in Houston power wholesaler Dynegy
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding those items, earnings were 88 cents a share, beating the
consensus analyst estimate of 70cents a share, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Conoco Inc., which is awaiting U.S. government
approval of its merger with Phillips Petroleum Co., said
first-quarter earnings fell 84% from a year earlier, and Phillips
posted a $25-million loss.</TE>
<TE>   Conoco had net income of $104million, or 16 cents a share, down
from $653 million, or $1.03, a year earlier. Excluding one-time gains
and losses, the company earned 9 cents a share, falling 11 cents
short of the expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the most difficult quarter we've experienced in four
years," Conoco Chairman and Chief Executive Archie Dunham said.</TE>
<TE>   At Bartlesville, Okla.-based Phillips, the per-share loss was 7
cents, contrasted with a profit of $516million, or $2.01 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 77% to $9.4billion from $5.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo-based Unocal said first-quarter earnings plunged 93%
after energy prices fell. Net income dropped to $22 million, or 9
cents a share, from $295 million, or $1.18, a year earlier. Revenue
fell 53% to $1.04 billion from $2.21 billion as mild weather and the
slumping economy cut fuel demand.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based Occidental said first-quarter earnings fell 95%
to $25 million, or 7 cents a share, from $484 million, or $1.30, a
year earlier. Revenue fell 44% to $2.53billion from $4.48 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A rise Thursday in oil prices and the stronger outlook for the
second quarter helped lift shares of oil companies on the New York
Stock Exchange even after the dismal quarterly results. ChevronTexaco
rose to $85.90, up 90 cents; Conoco rose to $28.22, up 42 cents;
Phillips traded 60 cents higher to $60.67; and ExxonMobil Corp.
gained 24 cents to $40.54. Unocal gained 5cents to $37.47, and
Occidental fell 3 cents to $28.52.</TE>

<HD>PacBell Overbills, Consumer Group Says</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Net users are often double-charged, report
alleges. Firm says problem has been fixed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Pacific Bell has engaged in a pattern of double-billing and
overcharging more than 100,000 of its high-speed Internet service
customers, then misleading California regulators about the extent of
the problem, according to a report released Thursday by a San Diego
consumer group.</LD>
<LD>   The 700-page report from the Utility Consumers' Action Network, or
UCAN, details extensive billing problems that it says routinely left
angry SBC PacBell customers fighting for months to rid their bills of
overcharges and unauthorized fees.</LD>
<LD>   The report accused the state's largest phone company of signing up
customers for Internet services they never ordered; charging
customers undisclosed fees and costs; and disconnecting local phone
service for nonpayment of disputed Internet charges.</LD>
<TE>   UCAN's report also included testimony from employees who said they
were instructed not to record complaints about billing for high-speed
Internet service but instead to pass them on to an affiliate that
does not report such numbers to regulators.</TE>
<TE>   The report will be filed with the California Public Utilities
Commission as part of a continuing state investigation into the
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Shames, UCAN's executive director and a frequent critic of
SBC PacBell, said the phone company has broken four state laws and
could be liable for more than $100 million in state fines and
penalties for its conduct.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell spokesman John Britton dismissed UCAN's allegations as
old news about billing problems resolved long ago.</TE>
<TE>   "What he's done is just repackaged the same information and
somehow made it $100 million," Britton said of Shames' report. "There
were larger billing systems issues occurring back in the beginning of
2001, and we believe we've taken care of them."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the report seems to jibe with the flood of complaints that
has been logged in the last year with the state PUC about billing
problems with the phone company's high-speed digital subscriber line
Internet access service, commonly known as DSL service.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell is the state's largest local phone company, serving
nearly 10 million customers. The company, a subsidiary of SBC
Communications Inc. of San Antonio, is among the largest DSL
providers in the country, with an estimated 700,000 customers in
California. UCAN, after a five-month investigation, estimated that
about 15% of SBC PacBell's DSL customers had some billing problem.</TE>
<TE>   In July, state regulators sent SBC PacBell a letter about the
mounting billing complaints and warned the company that its actions
may be violating state laws. They ordered SBC PacBell to "correct
these problems immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The billing complaints continued, however, and in January, UCAN
filed a formal complaint with regulators.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, the PUC launched an investigation into similar
billing problems as well as into allegations that the phone company
underreported the number of DSL complaints it had received.</TE>
<TE>   In state-mandated quarterly reports covering 2001, SBC PacBell
listed zero complaints about its DSL service. State officials said
they had documented more than 280 complaints about the service during
that period and more than 700 complaints over three years.</TE>
<TE>   Britton, the SBC PacBell spokesman, said the report of zero
complaints was an administrative oversight and that the company did
not know it was required to include DSL complaints lodged with
affiliated companies, such as DSL provider SBC Advanced Solutions
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   A revised filing listed more than 200 complaints, and after the
PUC began its investigation, SBC PacBell sent regulators "box loads
and box loads of information [about DSL complaints]--about 10 boxes
in all," said Sheri Inouye, a PUC spokeswoman. The commission is
scheduled to issue a report next week, she said, that will include an
updated complaint tally based on the new data.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, several customers told reporters that continuing DSL
billing disputes with SBC PacBell have repeatedly left them in
jeopardy of losing basic phone service.</TE>
<TE>   Howie Knodt of Chula Vista, Calif., said he ordered SBC PacBell's
DSL service as part of a promotion that included a Compaq computer if
he signed up for two years of service. When he started getting the
bills in early 2001, he said, they included double charges for a
$21.95 monthly computer fee.</TE>
<TE>   First, employees told him the problem was a computer glitch, and
his account was credited for the overcharge.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, beginning in May or June, every month, the bill was wrong,
and then I had to call and go through the whole thing over again,"
Knodt said. "I just cringed when I got the phone bill.... I started
getting letters saying I was delinquent."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, it seemed the double billing had stopped. "But I got my
bill last month," Knodt said, "and the problem was back."</TE>

<HD>Ross Plans New Distribution Center</HD>

<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ross Stores Inc. said Thursday that it is opening a distribution
center in Southern California as part of the retailer's ambitious,
four-year expansion program.</LD>
<LD>   The new 1.3-million-square-foot facility in Perris, about 70 miles
southeast of Los Angeles, will handle operations now done by the
company's Northern California distribution center.</LD>
<LD>   Newark, Calif.-based Ross, which has boomed along with other
value-priced merchants, has nearly doubled its store openings since
the late 1990s, when the company opened about 30 stores each year.</LD>
<TE>   Now with 465 stores in 22 states, Ross will open between 50 and 55
stores, increasing square footage by just more than 11%. The company
expects to maintain that growth rate for the next few years, said
Katie Loughnot, the company's director of investor relations. By the
end of 2005, Loughnot said, Ross will operate nearly 700 stores--a
50% growth in the store base in four years. Ross is projecting sales
in 2005 of $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles area has Ross' largest concentration of stores,
with more than 60. There are 90 stores in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Ross shares gained 96 cents to close at $39.87 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of two Executive Life policyholders' suits against Credit
Lyonnais died when a federal appeals court upheld a ruling by a trial
court that California's insurance commissioner has "exclusive
standing" under state law to bring such claims.</LD>
<LD>   More than 300,000 Executive Life policyholders claim they lost
$4.7 billion when France's sixth-largest bank took over the failed
life insurer.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision could affect
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's suit against Credit Lyonnais,
which seeks at least $2 billion in damages. U.S. District Judge A.
Howard Matz on Monday indicated he's inclined to dismiss Lockyer's
suit on the same exclusive standing principle. Matz said he would
wait to see what the 9th Circuit said on two appeals before issuing a
final order.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said first-quarter earnings tumbled as
combined sales of three key drugs fell 90% on fierce competition from
cheaper generics, sending shares to a five-year low.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based drug giant said company revenue shrank 7% to
$4.3 billion, excluding nonrecurring items. Profit from continuing
operations fell 30% to $875 million, or 45 cents a share, beating
estimates by 2 cents.</LD>
<LD>   The firm warned this month that earnings in the quarter would
decline by as much as 30% because of competition from generic forms
of its cancer drug Taxol, diabetes treatment Glucophage and anxiety
medicine BuSpar.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal will be able to ask a jury for "speculative"
damages from musician Courtney Love, a Los Angeles Superior Court
judge ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Love and Universal are battling over the status of the singer's
contract after she stopped recording for the label in 1999. Love
argues that California law allows artists to terminate contracts
after seven years. If she wins, the precedent may encourage other
artists to break their contracts.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Fumiko Wasserman sided with Universal, ruling that it is
eligible to receive the so-called speculative damages, or estimates
of potential losses, from Love if a jury finds she didn't have the
right to stop recording music.</LD>
<TE>   Wasserman also denied Love's argument that Universal couldn't
transfer her contract to another record company without her
permission.</TE>

<LD>Edwards Lifesciences Corp. said rival Medtronics Corp. agreed to pay
$20 million to settle patent litigation. As part of the agreement,
Medtronics will license two Edwards patents used in heart valve
repair, and pay Edwards unspecified royalties on sales of products
produced under the license.</LD>
<LD>   Edwards, based in Irvine, is the market leader in heart repair and
replacement valves, an $800-million annual market. The payment from
Medtronic represents about 30% of the estimated $60 million to $70
million spent annually on heart repair valves.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement also represents one-third of Edwards' 2001 net
income of $63 million. Edwards said it would be reported as a
one-time gain in the second quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Edwards said a separate patent dispute with Medtronics concerning
a heart-valve replacement technology will be submitted to binding
arbitration, with a hearing set for June.</TE>
<TE>   A patent infringement suit by Edwards against St. Jude Medical
Inc. of St. Paul, Minn., the world's biggest maker of mechanical
valves, is pending in federal court in Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and FleetBoston Financial Corp. were notified
that they may be charged with illegally demanding excess fees for
shares in initial public offerings during the Internet boom, a person
familiar with the situation said.</LD>
<LD>   The National Assn. of Securities Dealers alerted both banks that
it plans to pursue an enforcement case, the person said. Securities
regulators have been investigating for two years whether Wall Street
firms taking companies public solicited kickbacks from investors at a
time when stocks often would triple on the first day of trading.</LD>
<LD>   A J.P. Morgan official acknowledged that the firm had been
notified about potential charges but declined to comment. A Fleet

<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission jumped into the swelling
stock-analyst controversy Thursday, saying it has launched a formal
investigation of whether Wall Street researchers intentionally misled
investors during the 1990s bull market.</LD>
<LD>   Some critics said the SEC looks as if it's coming late to the game
and was pushed to take a bigger role in the wake of startling
allegations about analysts' conduct made public this month by New
York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC said it has probed analyst practices informally over the
last year but conceded that it is pursuing an official investigation
in part based on recent revelations about analysts' behavior.</LD>
<TE>   A formal inquiry lets SEC lawyers issue subpoenas to those under
investigation instead of simply requesting information from them.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC announcement underscores the degree to which analyst
conduct has become a hot issue on Wall Street and in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators and politicians have focused on analysts' alleged
conflicts of interest since the demise of the bull market two years
ago. But the issue assumed a dramatically higher profile 2 1/2 weeks
ago when Spitzer released evidence that was highly critical of
analysts at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   In a court filing, Spitzer unveiled a series of e-mails in which
Merrill's Internet analysts questioned the validity of their stock
picks in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Despite publicly lauding the shares, the analysts privately
disparaged them as "junk" and "crap" and indicated that their
bullishness was primarily aimed at luring lucrative investment
banking work for the firm. Merrill has denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer met with SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt on Wednesday in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The analyst controversy has potentially far-ranging implications
for Merrill and other brokerages. Besides the damage to their public
image, the firms could face a legal nightmare if charged with civil
or criminal securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's stock fell $2.15 to $42.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Thursday and is down 21% since Spitzer's broadside April
8.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill has sought a settlement with Spitzer, but the two sides
are said to be far apart in negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC rarely confirms its investigations publicly, but it may
have felt compelled to do so because Spitzer had stolen the political
thunder, observers said.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics have blasted the SEC for what they perceive as a slow
and reluctant crackdown on Wall Street wrongdoing, and said the
agency may be embarrassed that a lesser-known regulator seems to be
leading the charge against brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little late in the day. This [analyst] stuff is 2 years
old," said Saul Cohen, an attorney at Proskauer Rose in New York.</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said Pitt has moved aggressively on
the issue, and she downplayed speculation that the SEC was miffed at
the publicity accorded to Spitzer. "This is something the SEC was
already looking at and working on. There's no competition for who
gets to the courthouse first," Harlan said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC already had been working with the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange on a series of
reforms proposed to limit analysts' conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has set a May 8 vote on that package.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's formal investigation gives political cover to both it
and Spitzer, said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   "Spitzer needed [other regulators] to join him because otherwise
the industry could say, 'This is someone you never heard of and he is
just a strange lone wolf,'" Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   And though the SEC may feel it is being dragged into the matter,
"They have to show they are cooperating and working with Mr.
Spitzer," Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen state securities regulators, including California's,
announced this week that they have formed a task force to investigate
analysts with Spitzer, who is known to have subpoenaed other major
brokerages in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department also is looking at the issue for possible
violations of criminal fraud statutes.</TE>

<HD>Slatkin Is Taken Into Custody for Questioning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reed E. Slatkin, the money manager to Hollywood luminaries who
admitted to having lost $255million during a 15-year fraud spree, was
taken into custody in federal court in Los Angeles on Thursday to
await months of questioning by investigators.</LD>
<LD>   The co-founder of EarthLink Inc. agreed last month to plead guilty
to 15 counts of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. He returns to
court Monday to enter his plea to charges carrying a potential
sentence of as many as 15 years.</LD>
<LD>   Slatkin, 53, of Santa Barbara, will try to win a lesser sentence
by helping prosecutors and bankruptcy lawyers seeking to identify
additional assets and defendants.</LD>
<TE>   Slatkin's attorney, Brian Sun, said his client is eager to
cooperate. An attorney for a creditors committee, Richard Wynne, said
he hopes to begin distributing "significant" amounts of recovered
funds to investors by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   One unusual provision of Slatkin's plea agreement allows him to
request a lighter sentence because of the "psychological impact of
his association with certain individuals and/or groups," a reference
to his long involvement in Scientology.</TE>
<TE>   A Church of Scientology statement said Slatkin was excommunicated
because he "abused his position of trust to prey on his fellow
members of the church." Slatkin hasn't been a practicing minister in
any Scientologist church since 1983, the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin sat motionless, in an open-collared white shirt and sport
coat, his eyes downcast, until U.S. Magistrate Rosalyn M. Chapman
called him forward. She asked if he realized he was signing away his
rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, your honor," Slatkin murmured, barely audible.</TE>
<TE>   She denied Slatkin's request to take his pain and blood-pressure
medications to the Metropolitan Detention Center, saying a prison
doctor would prescribe appropriate drugs.</TE>

<LD>* Optical network equipment maker JDS Uniphase Corp. announced it is
cutting an additional 2,000 jobs as it posted a $4.3-billion loss for
its fiscal third quarter. For the three months ended March 30, the
company lost $3.19 per share, compared with a loss of $41.8 billion,
or $36.63 per share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding special
items, the company lost $66million, or 5 cents per share, compared
with a profit of $160 million, or 14 cents per share, a year ago. The
company reported sales of $262million for the third quarter, compared
with $920 million for the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   * Overture Services Inc. earned $29.3 million in the first quarter
as more businesses paid to have their Web sites listed prominently in

almost tripled to $142.8 million from $52 million.</LD>
<LD>   * Ingram Micro Inc., the biggest computer-products distributor,
reported a first-quarter loss as sales dropped 22% amid slow economic
growth. The loss was $265.4 million, or $1.74 a share, compared with
net income of $26.4 million, or 18 cents, in the year-earlier period.</LD>
<TE>   * Internet car seller Autobytel Inc. posted a wider net loss after
a restructuring charge but said it expected to post a net profit in
the second quarter. Autobytel reported a first-quarter net loss of

<LD>Network Associates Inc. shares fell 20% after the anti-virus software

accounting errors, and the company withdrew its $225-million offer
for the rest of McAfee.com Corp. The shares dropped $4.86 to $18.89
on the New York Stock Exchange. They sank as low as $17.40, paring as
much as $931.8 million from the company's market value. McAfee.com

<LD>   Network Associates booked sales and expenses incorrectly when the
company was run by Bill Larson, who quit as chief executive in

<HD>Tyco Cancels Plan to Split Into 4 Firms</HD>
<DH>Conglomerates: Chairman says proposal was a mistake. The
firm will cut 7,100 jobs, spin off its financial services unit. Its
shares fall 20%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd., a once-thriving conglomerate now fighting to
right itself, Thursday abandoned its controversial plan to bust the
company apart and instead will lay off 7,100 people and close 24
facilities, mainly in its electronics and telecommunications units.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco said it does plan to unload one division, its big financial
services arm CIT Group, through an initial public offering of CIT's
stock. But Tyco's stock--whose sluggish performance was a key impetus
behind the original breakup plan--plunged an additional 20%, or
$5.15, to close at $20.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, as
investors snubbed the revised strategy and Tyco also warned that its
future earnings would trail expectations.</LD>
<LD>   "It's difficult for investors to have a lot of confidence in Tyco
because they keep changing the plan," said Andy Palmer, who holds
Tyco bonds in the $2 billion of fixed-income assets he helps manage
at ASB Capital Management Inc.</LD>
<TE>   There were other announcements that underlined the turmoil at the
Bermuda-based concern, which is managed from Exeter, N.H. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Tyco posted a loss of $1.9 billion for its fiscal second quarter
ended March 31 because of $3.3 billion in pretax charges. The biggest
charge, $2.3 billion, reflected a write-down in the value of its
undersea telecommunications network.</TE>
<TE>   * Tyco also lowered its earnings forecast for the rest of its
fiscal year, to $2.60 to $2.70 a diluted share, before various
one-time charges. Analysts had expected $3.14 a share, according to
Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   * In a blunt letter to stockholders, Tyco Chairman L. Dennis
Kozlowski said that the breakup plan announced Jan. 22 was a
"mistake" and that he is "aware that Tyco's management has let you
down."</TE>
<TE>   But he also decried "the wave of rumors and misleading press
reports" of Tyco's accounting practices and other problems, saying
they damaged Tyco's business.</TE>
<TE>   * Tyco said it hopes to raise up to $7.2 billion from CIT's public
offering, which would rank among the largest U.S. IPOs. But that's a
22% haircut from the $9.2billion Tyco paid to buy CIT just a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Kozlowski said he and other senior managers will not receive
bonuses this year. Over the last three years, Kozlowski received more
than $330 million in total compensation, according to Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the plants to be closed are in California, but Tyco
spokesman Brad McGee declined to immediately identify them, saying
the plants had yet to be notified by headquarters. The 7,100 jobs
being cut represent 3% of Tyco's 242,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco, with revenue of $36 billion in fiscal 2001, was built from a
spree of acquisitions during the 1990s. Besides its interests in
financial services, telecommunications and electronics, it's a
leading maker of fire alarms, security systems, medical products,
valves and pipes, and plastics and adhesives.</TE>
<TE>   Though hardly sexy, these lines made Tyco a hot company in the
latter half of the 1990s, and its stock rose nearly sevenfold from
'95 through '98 alone. Tyco also patterned itself after another
hugely successful conglomerate, General Electric Co.</TE>
<TE>   But Tyco's luster started to tarnish in late 1999, when critics
began questioning its accounting practices and its stock fell
sharply. The questions grew as the Enron/Arthur Andersen debacle
unfolded and, although Tyco and Kozlowski have steadfastly defended
the company's accounting, Tyco's stock continued to lag.</TE>
<TE>   Then Tyco stunned Wall Street in January with its plan to abandon
the GE model and instead break into four public companies, along with
plans to sell its plastics and adhesives group. The rationale: The
quartet's stock prices together would trade higher than Tyco's stock
alone, and the individual units would give Wall Street better
"transparency" about their financial health and accounting.</TE>
<TE>   But "we came up with the wrong solution," Kozlowski said in his
letter. "In retrospect, it is now clear that we took the market by
surprise ... and failed adequately to take into account the
extraordinarily fragile market psychology and hostile environment
that has distracted and damaged our business in recent months."</TE>
<TE>   Even before its drop Thursday, Tyco's stock had plunged 46% since
the breakup plan was announced, and now more than $53billion of
investors' wealth has vanished since the strategy was unveiled.</TE>

<HD>Messier Names New Canal Plus Chairman</HD>

<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>In another move to defuse a management crisis, Vivendi Universal
Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier on Thursday promoted a popular
program director to head Vivendi's French pay-TV unit.</LD>
<LD>   Dominique Farrugia, 39, was named chairman of Canal Plus, one of
two positions previously held by Pierre Lescure, who also was
chairman of the holding company Canal Plus Group until he was fired
last week by Messier.</LD>
<LD>   Lescure's ouster and Messier's decision to bring in Xavier Couture
from a rival station, outraged Canal Plus employees.</LD>
<TE>   Lescure is an icon of French broadcasting and well liked by his
staff. But he couldn't stem steep financial losses at the channel.
Farrugia's appointment is seen as a conciliatory gesture by Messier.</TE>
<TE>   Like Lescure, Farrugia is well liked within Canal Plus and is seen
as someone who understands the company culture.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail to employees Thursday, Farrugia said Lescure was "in
agreement and support" of his appointment.</TE>
<TE>   In other steps to solidify his management team, Messier promoted
two senior executives. Philippe Germond, chairman of Cegetel Group,
Telecoms International and Vivendi Universal Net, also now will
oversee Vivendi's distribution and technology efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Agnes Touraine was named senior executive vice president for
Vivendi's European business. Touraine will continue as CEO of
Vivendi's publishing division.</TE>

<HD>Baja Fresh Hopes IPO Will Bring $58 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresh Enterprises Inc. of Thousand Oaks, which owns the Baja Fresh
Mexican Grill chain of restaurants, filed Thursday to go public. The
firm will attempt to cash in on what has been a hot market for
restaurant stocks this year.</LD>
<LD>   The company told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it
hopes to raise as much as $58 million in the stock offering.</LD>
<LD>   Fresh Enterprises has 157 company-owned and franchise-operated
restaurants nationwide, with more than half in California. The
company opened 55 of its restaurants last year.</LD>
<TE>   "The market potential outside of California is pretty good for
Baja Fresh," said Stephen Spence, an analyst with St. Louis-based
Kenny Securities. "In the fast-casual [restaurant] area, investors
are receptive."</TE>
<TE>   Stocks of many casual restaurant chains have been hot this year:
The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 16 small-cap casual-dining stocks has
surged 22% and hit a record high Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Baja Fresh markets itself as an upscale alternative to traditional
fast food, although less expensive than sit-down Mexican chain
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The average check per restaurant guest is $7.50, the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which opened its first restaurant in Newbury Park,
Calif., in 1990, was founded by Jim and Linda Magglos.</TE>
<TE>   The company's sales last year totaled $78 million. But profit was
slim: Net income was $41,000.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh Enterprises said it would use the net proceeds from the
initial public offering for general corporate purposes, including
repayment of $1.5 million to Jim Magglos. Expansion costs would
absorb $30 million of the IPO proceeds, the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Fresh Enterprises plans to open 22 company-owned
restaurants and 37 franchise-owned restaurants, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   The filing didn't indicate how many shares the company plans to
sell or the expected price per share. The firm plans to list the
stock on Nasdaq under the symbol BAJA.</TE>
<TE>   A competitor of Baja Fresh, Carlsbad-based Rubio's Restaurants
Inc., went public in May 1999 at $10.50 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio's stock (ticker symbol: RUBO) rose as high as $15.69 in
1999, then plunged as low as $2.56 in 2000. The shares have since
recovered somewhat, to $8.24 as of Thursday on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Banc of America Securities, Credit Suisse First Boston and Thomas
Weisel Partners will underwrite Fresh Enterprises' stock sale.</TE>

<HD>$459 Million in Cuts Are Considered for Fiscally Strapped
L.A. Schools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND and ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing its worst budget crisis in a decade, the Los Angeles Unified
School District is debating whether to increase class sizes,
eliminate specialized programs for immigrant students and cut funding
for counselors, nurses, assistant principals and other staff.</LD>
<LD>   The 736,000-student district is studying those steps and other
reductions totaling $459 million--about 9% of its general fund
budget--to balance its books in the coming school year. Final votes
by the school board are expected next week, along with continued
protests by parents and teachers.</LD>
<LD>   Officials have recommended $239 million in cuts directly affecting
schools and another $42 million from administrative offices. The rest
of the savings would come from delaying expansions in many other
areas, such as after-school programs and staff for gardening and
maintenance.</LD>
<TE>   L.A. Unified officials said they do not anticipate layoffs, but an
undetermined number of teachers, administrators and other employees
could be bumped to different jobs within the district next year if
their current positions are eliminated. This would occur as Los
Angeles schools anticipate 12,500 additional students.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously working through a very difficult time," said
district Supt. Roy Romer, who is proposing the cuts. "The only way
we're going to survive is to redouble our efforts."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers, parents and some school board members said they fear
that the austerity measures could undermine progress in test scores
and lead to deterioration of campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Under Romer's plan, many classes in grades four to 12 would rise
by two students, pushing some above 40 seats. Among the changes,
specialized classes for failing second-graders who have been held
back would double in size, to 20 students.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would defeat the whole purpose of the class," said
Eileen Morris, one of three teachers who work with struggling
second-graders at Carson Elementary School. "Most of our children
have a variety of learning challenges. When we have 10 students, we
get to work with each child each day."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the current tension, district officials said there is
little money to pay for a 5% raise sought by United Teachers-Los
Angeles in ongoing contract negotiations. Union leaders insist that
the money can be found if the district cuts deeper into its central
offices and reduces consultant contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "Read my lips: Hands off the classroom. Hands off the students.
Hands off class size increases, counselors, nurses," Day Higuchi, the
president of the Los Angeles teachers union, told the school board
Thursday during a meeting to review the budget. "Your proposal is
shortsighted."</TE>
<TE>   Another speaker urged the school board to protect library aides at
a time when the district is aggressively pressing literacy reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not want to see the school libraries closed half the day,"
said Connie Moreno of the California School Employees Assn., which
represents the aides.</TE>
<TE>   The budget reductions are necessary because of increased costs for
special education, workers' compensation and legal services, among
other things, Romer said. State funding, his staff said, is not
keeping pace with those and other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Romer's plan contains dozens of cuts, touching on such varied
activities as school police, transportation and accounting. On
Tuesday, the school board is scheduled to cast a long series of votes
on the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The trustees have expressed reservations about several proposals,
particularly those eliminating some programs for preschoolers and
dropouts.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a total lack of creativity and thoughtfulness in this
budget," board member David Tokofsky said in an interview. "The most
energetic teachers, counselors and nurses will leave. They will never
come back."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, individual schools would see their general fund budgets
reduced by 4% while central administration and the 11 local district
offices would be cut 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Schools that receive extra federal money for low-income children
would use those funds to help make up for the lost district revenues.
But critics stressed that those campuses would have less money for
nurses, counselors and psychologists.</TE>
<TE>   The precise impact on schools will not be known for weeks. After
the school board votes, principals will begin assembling their own
campus spending plans.</TE>
<TE>   Several school administrators said they are apprehensive about
having to choose among essential services.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine not having nurses and psychologists?" said
Sheridan Cole, interim principal of Berendo Middle School in the Pico
Union district. "That would be a devastating loss to a school."</TE>
<TE>   School Nurses May Be Cut</TE>
<TE>   Hollenbeck Middle School Principal Victoria Castro said her Boyle
Heights campus may have to cut funding for nurses. "In a high-poverty
area like this, sometimes a school nurse serves as a first stop for
the medical care for a family," said Castro, a former school board
member.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers are trying to avert closure of the Bellagio Road Newcomer
School in Bel-Air, which serves 390 immigrant children from El
Salvador, Guatemala, Korea, China, Armenia, Russia and elsewhere. The
students, in third through eighth grades, would be enrolled at
general schools throughout the district under the budget axing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to see many kids maybe even drop out, because it's
very difficult when you come here brand new," said Barbara Ellis, a
teacher at the school. "We have a very clear understanding of what
those children need and how to help them."</TE>
<TE>   The district's budget crisis is the most serious in a decade,
officials said. In 1992, the district had to slash $400 million from
a $3.8-billion budget. It did so partly by cutting employee salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Romer on Thursday accused board members of "micro-managing" the
budget and urged his bosses to make difficult if unpopular decisions.
"We have a budget ... in this district that is going to be very
painful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several school board members objected to Romer's plan to do away
with four early childhood centers for a savings of $1 million. Among
those is the Berkeley Avenue Children's Center in Echo Park, attended
by 39 students, ages 2 to 5.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and staffers said students will not get the attention they
receive at Berkeley if they are transferred to larger schools.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to get their priorities straight," said teacher Valerie
DeLong. "If they want a student to do well in elementary school,
they've got to invest the money in early childhood education."</TE>
<TE>   Marcela Lucero recalled that a teacher noticed how her 5-year-old
son had trouble cutting with scissors because he is left-handed.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher was able to buy left-handed scissors for him to
practice cutting.</TE>
<TE>   "If he was at a bigger center, I don't know ... if they would have
noticed that."</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley has two teachers, a principal and eight staff members who
may be transferred elsewhere. "It's sad because I get so attached to
the children and their parents," said Principal Thelma Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen the children when they came and couldn't speak a word
of English," Cruz said. "Now they sing and dance."</TE>

<HD>2 Convicted in Flap Over 'RocketBelt'</HD>
<DH>Courts: Inventor was abducted by ex-partner and another man
trying to recover jet backpack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men were convicted Thursday of kidnapping, false imprisonment and
extortion in a long-running battle with a former partner over a Buck
Rogers-like belt.</LD>
<LD>   A jury in Van Nuys found Thomas Laurence Stanley, 57, of Sugar
Land, Texas, and Christopher James Wentzel, 54, of North Hollywood
guilty on all counts. Both face life in prison when they are
sentenced June 7 in Los Angeles Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   The men lured Bradley Wayne Barker, 47, from Arkansas to Los
Angeles in November 1999 with the promise of a job on a Hollywood
movie set, the prosecutor said. When Barker arrived, they held him
against his will, sometimes handcuffed and in a box, for eight days
in an attempt to learn where he hid the RocketBelt 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The jet backpack was designed to lift a person into the air for a
few seconds. The belt, one of three in the world, was developed and
built by Stanley and Barker over three years.</TE>
<TE>   Their business partnership soured in 1994, when Stanley accused
Barker of padding manufacturing costs. After that, Barker set up a
company with another Texan, Joe Wright, that sued Stanley and won
control of the RocketBelt. In a later case, Stanley won a
$10.2-million default judgment against Barker and possession of the
belt. He never got it, despite his elaborate efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys Dale R. Atherton and Donald J. Calabria tried to
focus jurors on the often brutal relationship between the two
inventors. Barker once beat Stanley in the head with a hammer,
according to testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The defense also argued that Stanley and Wentzel were acting as
bail bondsmen and holding Barker so he would not skip out on an
Arkansas court date. Jurors rejected the argument.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is no one deserves to be put in a box," juror
Clara Acosta said outside court.</TE>

<HD>Blake Won't Face Death Penalty if Convicted</HD>
<DH>Crime: Life without parole would be maximum sentence.
Sister of actor's slain wife is not upset: 'It doesn't lessen the

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles prosecutors said Thursday they will not seek the death
penalty against Robert Blake, the 68-year-old actor accused of
fatally shooting his wife last May.</LD>
<LD>   Blake still faces a sentence of life in prison without parole if
he is convicted of killing Bonny Lee Bakley on May 4, 2001, near a
Studio City restaurant. He is being held without bail at Men's
Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Bakley's sister, Margerry Bakley, said she was not upset by the
prosecutors' decision.</LD>
<TE>   "It doesn't lessen the charge," she said. "He's still facing life
in prison with no parole if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need more of this unnecessary pain and suffering."</TE>
<TE>   The decision by the district attorney's office came after a
committee of prosecutors considered factors including the actor's
age, whether he had previous felony convictions and the circumstances
of the alleged crime, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee reviewed a memo prepared by prosecutors Gregory A.
Dohi and Patrick Dixon outlining the evidence against Blake and the
mitigating and aggravating circumstances, said Asst. Dist. Atty.
Peter Bozanich, who heads the office's special circumstances
committee.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, best known for his 1970s television series "Baretta,"
was arrested at his Hidden Hills home last week, and Monday pleaded
not guilty to charges of murder, soliciting murder and conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   His bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, 46, of Burbank, pleaded not guilty
to conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's lawyer, Harland W. Braun, said Thursday that the
prosecution's decision not to pursue the death penalty relieves some
of the pressure felt by those involved with the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is just absolutely wonderful that they did it so
early," Braun said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege Blake shot Bakley, 44, while she sat in the
couple's car near Vitello's restaurant, where they had dined earlier
in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have said Blake was unhappy in his marriage. According
to Braun, prosecutors will try to prove that Blake tried to hire two
stuntmen who worked on "Baretta" to kill Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   Bozanich said Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley did not influence the
decision not to seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The panel that made the decision consists of the office's top nine
officials and three experienced trial deputies, who rotate into the
position every three months.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner said he created the committee to
make sure the death penalty is applied consistently throughout the
county. He said Thursday's decision follows the office's
long-standing policies.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School and former
federal prosecutor, said the prosecution's decision was not
surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally, the district attorney's office has not charged
domestic violence cases with the death penalty," Levenson said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, although prosecutors may say Blake's celebrity was not a
factor in their decision, Levenson said it would weigh on jurors'
minds.</TE>
<TE>   Trying for the death penalty would have increased the media frenzy
around the case, said Franklin E. Zimring, a professor at UC
Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the ghosts every Halloween is the ghost of the O.J.
Simpson trial," he said. "So raising the stakes in a situation where
you don't have to is something best avoided."</TE>
<TE>   But Zimring said prosecutors give up a bargaining chip by choosing
not to seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "The tactical advantage which is surrendered in excluding a death
penalty on the quick side," he said, "is the ability to provoke a
plea."</TE>

<HD>Navy Makes No El Toro Promises</HD>
<DH>Land use: Officials, meeting with O.C. and Irvine leaders,
hope to have a plan to dispose of the base ready by May 31. They say
they'll honor zoning vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Navy officials arrived in Orange County on Thursday with pledges of
cooperation but no promises about what will happen at the former El
Toro Marine base after the land is sold to private buyers.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Secretary of the Navy H.T. Johnson and the U.S. General
Services Administration's Gordon Creed spent the morning meeting
individually with Orange County supervisors and the afternoon with
Irvine city officials. The Navy hopes to have its plan to dispose of
the property in place by May 31. Irvine hopes to annex the base early
next year.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson told supervisors that he would honor base zoning approved
last month by Orange County voters that calls for parkland and
limited development; that vote killed the county's plans for an
airport. But he gave no guarantees about existing activities at the
base, including stables, a golf course, recreational vehicle storage
and agricultural leases.</LD>
<TE>   The Navy has said it will honor subleases in effect on March 5,
but only a lease with Bordier's Nursery falls into that category.</TE>
<TE>   "They just want to get the base off their hands," Board of
Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad said. "They have no idea how
it's going to be parceled or what the price is going to be. If
[someone] wants the land for agriculture, they're going to have to
buy it. If they want to have horse stables, they'll have to buy it."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who declined to be interviewed, acknowledged that the
courts could overturn last month's vote--a suit challenging the
election has been filed by airport proponents--and that annexation by
Irvine isn't assured, Coad said.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine officials have said they hope to circulate an environmental
review required for annexation by Sept. 1, with approval in January
by the Local Agency Formation Commission, which oversees annexations
and incorporations. City officials were still in meetings Thursday
and couldn't be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer said he left his meeting convinced the
Navy will work with Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "If they have to go the extra mile to make the deal work with
Irvine, they have to make that happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said he was heartened that the officials couldn't answer
all the supervisors' questions. That showed, he said, that they did
not have their own agenda and would work with Irvine on the answers.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith, a longtime supporter of a commercial
airport at the base, said his message to Johnson and Creed was that
annexation will be a complicated undertaking. Irvine's previous
applications to take over the base were withdrawn because the city's
documents were incomplete. Among the studies is a financial review
showing how the city will pay for servicing the new area.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a huge process," Smith said. "Their being ready
to annex by the end of the year is a myth. The system doesn't work
that way. I don't think the Navy recognized that."</TE>
<TE>   Protecting county taxpayers from paying any more for the upkeep of
the 4,700-acre base was the main concern of Supervisor Jim Silva. The
cost was to be about $7million this year. Navy officials have said
they will end the county's responsibility for the base June 30.</TE>
<TE>   "I have concern about the additional cost to the county," said
Silva, who sits on LAFCO as a county alternate and will vote on
Irvine's annexation request.</TE>
<TE>   Coad and her advisor/husband, Tom Coad, said they became familiar
with sales of federal property in the 1960s when they bought land at
Camp Elliott in San Diego. The sales brochure promised the area would
be developed into neighborhoods with parks and schools. Nearly 40
years later, nothing has been built and the property remains in
litigation, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Only three years ago, they were still sweeping for spent
ordnance," Cynthia Coad said.</TE>

<HD>Agency in Jobs Scam to Return $2.4 Million</HD>
<DH>Welfare: Agreement comes in plea of no contest to misuse of
funds, falsifying records.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Hollywood job training agency that fleeced the city and county of
millions in a welfare-to-work scheme agreed Thursday to return $2.4
million in public funds, the district attorney's office said.</LD>
<LD>   In a sampling of records studied, nearly all of the 1,900 jobs
that the United Community Resources Agency claimed to have found for
clients were phony, prosecutors said. Money that was supposed to be
spent on helping refugees and other recent immigrants find those jobs
instead accumulated in the agency's bank accounts, the district
attorney's office said.</LD>
<LD>   At an arraignment hearing Thursday, the agency pleaded no contest
to misuse of public funds and falsifying public records.</LD>
<TE>   The investigation began in October 2000 when a group of employees
gave the district attorney's office employment records they thought
were fraudulent, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jennifer Snyder said.
Investigators looked at a sampling of those records and found that as
much as 85% of them claimed that jobs had been found for clients at
companies that either didn't exist or were listed with false
addresses and phone numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the kind of thing that gets the Golden Fleece Award,
because public dollars are being just frittered away," said Snyder,
who heads the district attorney's internal welfare fraud section.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the district attorney served search warrants and
seized the $2.4 million in the agency's bank account, which the
agency has agreed to forfeit. Under its plea, the agency also will
abandon $800,000 in current billings to the county and city.</TE>
<TE>   The training agency's board of directors said in a written
statement that it was "deeply troubled over the charges."</TE>
<TE>   "Until today, our organization's 28-year history was notable for
the excellence of our programs, which received wide commendation,
and, until this recent series of events, had an enviable track
record.</TE>
<TE>   "The actions in question eluded not only our board of directors
and independent accountants but, until recently, city and county
grant program auditors."</TE>
<TE>   The agency began as the United Chinese Restaurant Assn. Cooking
School but changed its name and mission after welfare reform took
hold in the mid-1990s, Snyder said. The county Department of Public
Social Services contracted its welfare-to-work programs to that
agency and 13 other nonprofit groups. The agency seemed like a good
fit for refugee programs, Snyder said, because staff members could
speak several languages.</TE>
<TE>   From 1998 to 2001, the value of the agency's contracts doubled to
more than $4 million, according to tax filings and audit reports.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, the county audited the agency and discovered
falsified client records. Rather than rescind contracts, the county
ordered the agency to refund the $68,858 in question.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that discovery, the county departments of Public Social
Services and Community and Senior Services continued paying the
nonprofit to administer training programs. Since 1999, the training
agency has received nearly $7 million in revenue, 94% of which came
from government contracts.</TE>
<TE>   When its money was seized in October, however, the agency closed
its doors and the county sent its clients to other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney also has charged the agency's executive
director, Angelita Gonzalez, with misuse of public funds, falsifying
public records and grand theft. She has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The theft charge stems from the agency's pursuit of another $2
million in contracts for the coming year, allegedly knowing job
placement claims were false. That money was not paid.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Sobel, an attorney representing Gonzalez, said agency
employees could have falsified documents without his client's
knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   He added, "No one's saying the agency didn't do its job of helping
people."</TE>
<TE>   The agency's attorney, Michael Artan, also blamed employees.</TE>
<TE>   "It is apparent that something improper happened," he said. "It
seems to us it occurred at the lower levels of the organization."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the plea agreement, the agency will aid the
investigation.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Write-Ins Lose in Court</HD>
<DH>Elections: Judge denies requests to put them on the mayoral
runoff ballot, leaving only one name voters will face.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The unprecedented Long Beach mayor's race landed in court Thursday,
and the end result may make the upcoming election all the more
peculiar: The June runoff ballot will carry only one name, but there
are two additional candidates--both write-ins.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very interesting case," Los Angeles Superior Court Judge
Dzintra Janavs said after the Thursday morning hearing, at which she
heard arguments from attorneys for the city of Long Beach and the top
three vote-getters in the April 9 mayoral primary.</LD>
<LD>   The judge denied the requests of the first- and third-place
finishers--termed-out Beverly O'Neill and Norm Ryan, who initiated
the proceedings--to have their names on the June ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Voters in this city of 461,500 who approved term limits, Janavs
observed, clearly did not envision "this glitch that nobody
anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent O'Neill pulled off a rare feat in placing first as a
write-in candidate in the primary. Vice Mayor Dan Baker placed
second, and Ryan, who previously wrote a utility tax cut proposition,
placed third among six candidates. A runoff election was forced
because no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan said he will run as a write-in candidate should he decide not
to appeal Janavs' ruling. "One way or the other," he said, "I'm in
the race."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach's election law includes a voter-approved ordinance
limiting any elected city official to two terms. But the ordinance
does allow a termed-out politician to run as a write-in candidate.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's hearing, attorneys offered contrary interpretations
of that ordinance and other election code subsections.</TE>
<TE>   There was ample invoking of the voters' intent, the will of the
voters, the rights of the voters. More than one attorney used the
word "absurd" to describe an outcome that would leave one candidate
on the ballot in a runoff election.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan's lawyer argued essentially that, by virtue of being a
termed-out incumbent, O'Neill is not a qualified candidate, as
required of the two finalists for the general election. As a result,
he said, Baker and Ryan would be the top two finishers, and thus
Ryan's name should join Baker's on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge disagreed, saying that to do so "leaves out a whole
batch of voters who voted for O'Neill."</TE>
<TE>   Janavs said she saw no grounds for, or the fairness in, a
third-place finisher from the primary competing in a runoff meant for
two. That, she said, is "the biggest problem I see you have.... It
just doesn't make sense."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill filed a cross-complaint in Ryan's case, seeking to have
her own name placed on the ballot were the judge to decide the ballot
needed two names.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney argued that voters might think that there was only
one candidate in the race if O'Neill's name was not added to the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But her success in the primary belied that, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Janavs ruled that Long Beach's term limits law clearly does not
allow "a maxed-out candidate" on the ballot.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed President Bush's nominations of
attorneys Percy Anderson and Jack Walter to become federal district
court judges in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson, 52, and Walter, 57, were tapped for federal judgeships
by Bush's father in 1992. However, their nominations died without
action by the Senate in the waning days of his administration.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's action had been eagerly awaited at the Los Angeles
federal courthouse. With six judicial vacancies, the 21 active U.S.
District Court judges have had to bear an exceptionally heavy
caseload for many months.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very excited," Chief U.S. District Court Judge Consuelo B.
Marshall said after learning of the Senate's unanimous vote. "We have
waited a long time for this."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall said the average caseload now exceeds 300 per judge, a
record high.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, 52, a political independent, is a partner at the law
firm of Sonnenschein, Nath &amp; Rosenthal. Walter, 57, a Republican, is
a senior partner at Walter, Finestone &amp; Richter, a firm he founded.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from UCLA School of Law, Anderson worked for
three years at San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services before
joining the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles in 1979. He left the office in 1985 for private practice,
specializing in civil litigation and white-collar criminal defense.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson served on the Christopher Commission, which investigated
racism and brutality in the Los Angeles Police Department more than a
decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Loyola Law School, Walter served as a federal
prosecutor from 1970 to 1972. He won a conviction in a major case
involving a gang of sophisticated thieves that burglarized a Laguna
Niguel bank, rifled every safety deposit box and escaped with
millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Walter later joined a national law firm and subsequently founded
his firm, which specializes in complex civil cases. He has served for
more than 20 years on a panel of attorneys who represent indigent
defendants in criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson and Walter were unanimously recommended to the White
House last year by a six-member screening committee of Republican and
Democratic lawyers. An American Bar Assn. screening committee gave
both men its highest rating.</TE>
<TE>   No date has been set for a swearing-in ceremony.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Give Old School New Life Awaits OK</HD>
<DH>Oak View: Shuttered campus would be converted into a
library and community center, if residents agree to pay.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The campaign to turn a former elementary school into a library and
community center may soon be won by Oak View residents--if they are
willing to pony up the needed funds.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Supervisor Steve Bennett said he expects the board
to approve the county's purchase of the closed Oak View School from
the Ventura Unified School District for the asking price of $1.2
million. That action should come May 7 or 14.</LD>
<LD>   But for the sale to go through, Oak View residents must vote to
raise their property taxes by up to $49 a year. That money would
support not only the purchase of the 4.63-acre property but also pay
to turn the school into a family resource center featuring community
services, parks and a larger site for the Oak View Library.</LD>
<TE>   For assessment purposes, the community has been divided into three
zones. Residents of Zone A, in the immediate area of the school site,
would be assessed the full $49 per year. Residents of Zones B and C
would be assessed $24.50 per year. The added amounts would appear on
residents' property tax bills.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, county supervisors received a survey showing
that more than 60% of Oak View residents would support the annual
assessment if it meant the Mahoney Avenue school would be converted
to public use. The campus was closed in the summer of 2000 with
students relocating to Sunset Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   For only the third time in county history, the vote will be
conducted by mail. Bennett said he expects ballots to go out at the
end of May with voters having 45 days to return them.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Bradley, assistant registrar of voters for Ventura County,
said the assessment only needs a simple majority to pass.</TE>
<TE>   Time is of the essence for the vote.</TE>
<TE>   The county has already submitted a purchase offer to Ventura
Unified, with an Aug. 10 deadline for closing escrow. The county
wants to have the ballots counted in time to get the added tax
assessment on the bills that are mailed out in July.</TE>
<TE>   "From all indications, it looks like it's going to work," said
Christy Madden, community development manager with the County
Executive Office.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the anticipated revenue from the passage of the
special assessment, she said, funding for the project would come from
$496,000 in state bond money earmarked for community centers and
parks.</TE>
<TE>   The county is negotiating with local nonprofit agency Interface to
manage the center.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said the idea behind the purchase is to lease the property
to nonprofit groups that serve community needs.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Leigh Melander said a number of groups have expressed an
interest in the site, including Help of Ojai and the Ojai Birth
Resource &amp; Family Center.</TE>
<TE>   As steering committee chairwoman for Community Works!, a group
leading the drive to preserve the school site, Melander said the
recent commitment of $100,000 by the Ojai Valley Library Friends and
Foundation has jump-started the grass-roots campaign to turn the site
into what she hopes will be a multiservice center for the Oak View
community.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Kemper of the foundation said the group committed the funds
for the estimated $550,000 cost of renovating the proposed
3,690-square-foot library site. Currently the library is housed in a
2,000-square-foot building on Ventura Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "This will basically double the size of the library, and we can
expand hours," Kemper said. The library is open 24 hours a week now.</TE>
<TE>   Another benefit of the move, Bennett and others said, is that a
site off Ventura Avenue would be much safer for children who study at
the library after school.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's money was given in the form of a challenge grant,
meaning it is contingent upon the passage of the special assessment
and that the community raise additional funds toward the cost of the
renovation.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't just want to throw $100,000 out there, but it is the
library foundation's perspective that this is money we want to spend
on the project," Kemper said.</TE>
<TE>   While tax measures often are difficult to pass, Don Facciano,
president of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., said he wouldn't
write off this one.</TE>
<TE>   "The cause is good, and the place is just sitting empty," he said.
"The residents seem to want to support it."</TE>
<TE>   Community meetings have yielded positive responses, Melander said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are in pretty good shape," she said about the upcoming
vote. "If the community really wants it, they will find it in their
hearts and wallets to support this."</TE>

<HD>Riots Are Invoked in Union Drive</HD>
<DH>Labor: Organizers targeting a Koreatown market say
inequities of '92 remain. Store rejects group's complaints.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latino workers in a nasty labor dispute with a major Koreatown
supermarket tried to gain leverage Thursday by exploiting the
upcoming 10th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots.</LD>
<LD>   The workers said management of the bustling Assi market is
perpetuating the kind of economic inequality that many social
activists have blamed for widespread looting that accompanied the
riots.</LD>
<LD>   "We only want fair wages and equal treatment for our work," said
Aurelio Ramirez, 33, one of about two dozen employees and supporters
who pushed aside security guards and marched inside the market
proclaiming, "Justicia! Justicia!"</LD>
<TE>   All wore red and yellow T-shirts emblazoned with the name of their
incipient organization, the independent Immigrant Workers Union.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters were soon ushered out of the store without
incident.</TE>
<TE>   But activists said a catalog of charges--including allegations of
discrimination against Latinos, violation of wage laws, denying
workers a 10-minute break and illegally dismissing one
employee--would be filed later with federal and state labor
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting the phalanx of protesters and journalists inside the
market was Kevin S. Kim, an attorney representing the market. He
called the complaints groundless.</TE>
<TE>   "The company has complied with all the labor laws, regulations and
public policies," Kim told reporters assembled amid shelves of fresh
vegetables and sacks of rice imported from Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Organizing the action was the Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates,
or KIWA, a nonprofit group funded by private foundations that has
worked on issues arising from one of Southern California's most
crucial labor-management relationships: Korean and Korean American
employers and their large work force of Latino immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Korean entrepreneurs, often families, employ low-wage Latino hands
at a wide range of job sites, including mom-and-pop grocery stores,
garment factories and restaurants. Few of these workers have union
representation. KIWA, with a staff of Korean and Spanish speakers,
has sought to fill the void by representing workers in
labor-management disputes arising in Koreatown, where many Latino
immigrants live and work.</TE>
<TE>   The labor activists acknowledged using the riot anniversary as a
tactic to pressure the market owners to improve conditions for
workers, many of whom earn little more than the California minimum
wage of $6.75 an hour. Employees at unionized supermarkets routinely
earn double that amount or more.</TE>
<TE>   A March vote asking Assi's 150 or so workers if they wanted to
unionize resulted in a virtual tie--labeled a victory by management,
which successfully fought back the organization effort after an
acrimonious battle. Owners of other Koreatown markets and businesses
watched the conflict closely, fearing a spreading current of
unionization and higher labor costs.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides are challenging disputed votes in the March election
before federal labor officials.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, union advocates handed out pamphlets titled, "10
Years After '92's Civil Unrest--Economic Disparity in Koreatown."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Assi--part of a larger group of affiliated markets with
outlets in Orange County and on the East Coast--has only been at the
Koreatown site on West 8th Street site for four years. Kim, the
management attorney, dismissed as spurious the asserted link between
the labor dispute and the riots.</TE>
<TE>   Union activists say the underlying issues of economic disparities
and ethnic tensions roiling the market were also part of the
combustible mix that exploded on the streets 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Koreatown was a major target of rioters and looters, some angered
by the earlier fatal shooting of a black girl by a Korean shop-owner
who said she feared for her life and received a light sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to say that how Korean employers treat their Latino
workers is race relations," said Paul Lee, a KIWA official who is
coordinating the unionization drive.</TE>
<TE>   "If you treat them well, and you pay them well, then you're
helping race relations."</TE>

<HD>Does Burger TV Ad Inhabit a Values-Free Zone?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I told myself it was just a TV commercial about a cheeseburger. Not
something to get worked up about. It was supposed to be funny. Hey,
I'm a funny guy; why wasn't I laughing?</LD>
<LD>   It's probably because deep down, we're all sick little puppies,
and the commercial dredged up an uncomfortable moment from long ago.
Even so, I was still willing to forget about the commercial until
Laguna Hills businessman Michael McLean contacted me and said he was
royally outraged by it.</LD>
<LD>   So, here we go. The spot was aired for the AM PM convenience
stores and shows father and son in a van, chowing down on burgers,
nachos and sodas. Dad turns to son and goes over the story they're
going to tell Mom--namely, that they had salads for lunch.
Apparently, Mom is a stickler for healthier stuff than that found in
burgers and nachos.</LD>
<TE>   Father and son square their stories, and the commercial ends with
Dad suggesting they get some breath mints to further conceal their
deed.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, the cover-up is complete.</TE>
<TE>   That's what riled McLean, a 51-year-old husband of 30 years and
father of a grown son. What kind of message does that send, he asks,
in an age when Enron and Arthur Andersen, not to mention some
elements in the Roman Catholic Church, are covering up misdeeds?</TE>
<TE>   It's just a commercial, I timidly offer.</TE>
<TE>   "Funny you should mention that," he says. "They're just
commercials as long as they stay within certain lines of
responsibility. For example, if Mom had popped out and busted them on
the spot, OK, that's a commercial. That's satire."</TE>
<TE>   McLean makes the point that children saw that commercial. If it
was supposed to be funny, he says, "this one slipped through some
startling cracks. I see no sense of social responsibility
whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   Wait a darn minute, says Kris Kaligian, the advertising manager
for BP West Coast Products, the parent company of the convenience
store chain that adjoins Arco service stations and operates in five
Western states.</TE>
<TE>   She reiterates that the commercial "is intended to be humorous."</TE>
<TE>   Kaligian is extremely good-natured in the face of McLean's
complaint, but that's not to say she's dismissive of him. But neither
does she seem inclined to lapse into a lengthy philosophical defense
of the commercial.</TE>
<TE>   "You get positive and negative feedback on advertising," she says.
"Advertising is one of those things; it happens to be something that
elicits reaction--some foreseen and some unforeseen."</TE>
<TE>   I ask if the ad team anticipated adverse reaction to the
father-son commercial. Or if the thinking is that even negative
reaction would generate buzz about the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We're never looking for negative feedback," Kaligian says. The
food in the commercial is sold at the minimarkets, and the intent,
"obviously, was to have a humorous message ... and to sell
cheeseburgers."</TE>
<TE>   My verdict? I don't share McLean's outrage, but I should. He's
raising a legitimate issue, and I winced at the commercial just as I
assume many others did.</TE>
<TE>   Here's why I didn't like it: Thirty-five years ago, Dad and I
headed for some local nighttime outing. Once in the car, however, Dad
informed me we were instead taking a 90-minute trip to an out-of-town
racetrack that he liked.</TE>
<TE>   Fine by me. Except ... the next thing out of his mouth was that I
wasn't to tell Mom.</TE>
<TE>   I remember being greatly bothered by that. I was equally close to
both parents and wanted no part of deceiving Mom nor squealing on
Dad. Worse, though, was knowing that Dad would instigate such a scam
and include me as a co-conspirator.</TE>
<TE>   The incident stuck with me, with a weird twist I've added only in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   What if, I asked myself, Mom was in on it? What if Dad's strategy,
even if misguided, was to let me think he and I shared a secret?
Father-son bonding on a road trip?</TE>
<TE>   I've embraced that diagnosis. That Dad, what a scamp.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, he's gone to that great paddock in the sky and
can't be quizzed. Mom could probably clear the whole thing up.</TE>
<TE>   If I ever decide to ask her about it.</TE>
<TE>   Which I won't.</TE>

<HD>Pomona Priest Charged With Abuse</HD>

allegedly molesting two sisters in 1997-2001, and could face up to
eight years in prison. He will be arraigned today.</DH>

<LD>A Pomona priest was charged Thursday with four felonies for allegedly
molesting two sisters over four years, becoming the first Archdiocese
of Los Angeles pastor to face prosecution since the sexual abuse
scandal rocked the church nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   Father Honesto Bismonte, 72, an associate pastor at St. Joseph's
Catholic Church, will be arraigned today via a video hookup from the
West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, according to San
Bernardino County prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors charged Bismonte with three felony counts of lewd and
lascivious acts with a child under 14 and one felony count of lewd
and lascivious acts with a child 14 or 15.</LD>
<TE>   Briye McCann, a deputy district attorney, said she filed two
counts for each victim, with the first count covering the first two
years of abuse and the second count covering the second two years.</TE>
<TE>   "The charges involving a child under the age of 14 mean he could
face a much more lengthy sentence," said McCann.</TE>
<TE>   The charges involving a child under 14 carry a maximum state
prison term of eight years. The charge involving a 14- or 15-year-old
carries a maximum of three years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   McCann said the priest committed the crimes between 1997 and 2001,
when he rented a room from the girls' aunt in her Fontana home.</TE>
<TE>   The girls, who are sisters, would frequently visit their aunt's
home.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters, now 13 and 17, told Fontana police that the priest
touched them over and under their clothing about 50 times, said Sgt.
Robert Beltran.</TE>
<TE>   Bismonte was arrested Monday and held on $200,000 bail.
Archdiocese officials learned of the allegations last week and put
the priest on leave, said Tod Tamberg, an archdiocesan spokesman. An
anonymous tipster reported Bismonte on an archdiocese hotline for
sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday from jail, Bismonte declared his
innocence and blamed a cultural misunderstanding for the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   He said hugging and other physical contact with children are far
more accepted in his Philippine culture.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry this has come this far," he said, blaming the wave of
current allegations against priests for his plight.</TE>
<TE>   Bismonte acknowledged taking the girls to the park to play on the
swings.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to wrestle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bismonte said he believed that the girls came forward because of
publicity over abuse accusations against priests.</TE>
<TE>   "The plaintiffs' credibility is weak," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, Bismonte was assigned to St. Joseph's, which
also operates a school. He served previously at St. Anthony of Padua
in Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran said the allegations were reported to a school official,
who informed the county Department of Children and Family Services.
Social workers contacted Fontana police.</TE>

<HD>New Lease on Life for San Quentin</HD>
<DH>Prisons: State wants to modernize the facility and replace
its outmoded death row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS and JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- In an abrupt reversal, the state has commuted the death
penalty for California's famous San Quentin prison, deciding instead
to modernize the aging fortress and build new facilities for
condemned killers.</LD>
<LD>   Confronted with the high cost of constructing replacement prisons
and potential delays that could stretch as long as 10 years,
corrections officials acknowledged Thursday that they have decided to
give San Quentin a new lease on life.</LD>
<LD>   "It's looking more and more like we will stay at San Quentin,"
said Stephen Green, assistant secretary of the Youth and Adult
Correctional Agency. "The more we looked at the numbers for
decommissioning San Quentin and building replacement facilities, the
more expensive those projects seemed to be."</LD>
<TE>   The decision was a surprise turnaround for state officials who had
pushed for years to shut down the 150-year-old, red-roofed prison
whose decaying buildings require constant and costly maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   With its 600 condemned inmates, the prison's death row outgrew its
quarters long ago and is severely overcrowded.</TE>
<TE>   Green said that although there has never been an escape from death
row, its obsolete design raises continual worries about security and
guard safety. The exercise yard, for instance, is enclosed with a
wall about 35 feet from the shoreline--a design that would never be
found in a modern prison.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Green added, two condemned inmates were able to hide
behind a shower facility before being discovered with a rope ladder
and a hand-drawn map of the area immediately outside the walls.</TE>
<TE>   And in another incident, two prisoners breached a control room in
an apparent effort to take hostages. Green said they were subdued
because there were five correctional officers in the control room at
that time, instead of the two who are normally on duty there.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the clamor to close the prison were local officials and
developers, who envisioned housing projects or civic facilities on
the 432 acres of waterfront real estate on San Francisco Bay in Marin
County.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of moving death row inmates to other maximum-security
facilities and constructing new prisons to house the others at San
Quentin, Green said state officials have come up with a plan: build a
new modern death row on the site and rehabilitate the remaining
buildings for minimum-security prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   He said the proposal still has to be presented to the Legislature
and the governor for approval.</TE>
<TE>   One key lawmaker, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco), already likes the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably makes more sense than trying to build a new prison,"
Burton said Thursday. "There were no easy answers. This is probably
the best of the solutions, although in Marin County everybody had
their eyes on that property."</TE>
<TE>   Burton said he had not objected to the closure but had fought
plans to move Death Row inmates to out-of-the-way facilities. With
capital punishment such a controversial issue, he said death rows
should be located "close to lawyers, close to the media and close to
those who want to protest for or against it."</TE>
<TE>   Burton, who personally opposes the death penalty, said those
criteria left the state prison in Folsom as the only other logical
site, but local residents there "weren't too crazy about that idea."</TE>
<TE>   The new solution, "very" tentatively estimated by Green to cost
$199 million, calls for the construction of two facilities at San
Quentin designed to house 968 death row inmates. The complex on the
west side of the property, commonly called "the ranch," would include
a new death chamber and a medical facility so condemned prisoners
would no longer be taken to local hospitals when there is a serious
injury or illness.</TE>
<TE>   The portion of San Quentin that serves as a reception center for
new inmates would be rehabilitated and converted to housing for
minimum-security prisoners. Its reception function would be taken
over by California State Prison Solano in Vacaville.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Joe Nation (D-San Rafael) said he had not seen the
proposal but noted that past estimates predicted the cost of
renovating the prison would far exceed the cost of replacing it with
new facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, this facility houses the most violent criminals in
California in an urban area, and it's not a safe facility," said
Nation, whose district includes the prison. "The status quo won't
work, but the state is facing a $20-billion shortfall, and we need to
be sure that whatever we do is in the best interests of the
taxpayers."</TE>

<HD>Boost School Security, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: Fences and police presence are among the
grand jury's suggestions. Educators caution against prison-like
settings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County high schools need more security, including perimeter
fences, surveillance cameras and police officers to further reduce
the chances of a Columbine-type incident, according to a grand jury
report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the panel's lengthy and pointed recommendations, several
school officials said that turning campuses into prison-like
environments would not stop a gunman and sends the wrong message to
the community.</LD>
<LD>   "What's right for one school may not be right for another school.
This needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis," said Don Austin,
general counsel for the Ventura Unified School District, one of three
districts criticized in the report.</LD>
<TE>   "Perimeter fencing does not guarantee the safety of kids," Austin
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Columbine, as well as a shooting that left two dead
at Santana High School in San Diego County and a deadly police
shooting last year at an Oxnard school, grand jurors visited 20 area
high schools to investigate security measures.</TE>
<TE>   While the panel lauded schools for having safety manuals and
emergency plans, the grand jury found four schools had no established
programs to check for weapons. They were identified as Ventura, Buena
(Ventura Unified), Oak Park and Nordhoff (Ojai Unified) high schools.</TE>
<TE>   The report also states that five campuses are far too accessible
to nonstudents.</TE>
<TE>   "Members of the Grand Jury were able to walk onto the school
grounds of Nordhoff, Buena and Ventura high schools during school
hours with no detection. A staff person at Ventura High School
eventually challenged us," the report stated.</TE>
<TE>   Although not named in the report, the other two high schools could
include campuses in Santa Paula and Fillmore, which have partial
fencing such as at the other three schools, said Charles Weis, the
county's superintendent of schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Every school has different safety needs and when you start to say
that all of them have to have this or have to have that, you lose
some of the context of the pressing safety issues," Weis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Fences are good but they are not the answer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Weis cited both Columbine High in Colorado and the January 2001
killing at Hueneme High in Oxnard, where police fatally shot
17-year-old Richard Lopez, who had walked onto the campus undetected
and put a gun to the head of a female student.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, the schools had fencing and police or security
guards on duty.</TE>
<TE>   Weis and others said the report--which contains only suggestions
and is not binding--was accurate and necessary but is best utilized
as a reminder that schools cannot become complacent about safety and
must continually evaluate security policies, conduct campus
inspections and offer good counseling services.</TE>
<TE>   Austin said most schools are vigilant on warning employees to be
on the lookout for strangers. Austin said he was recently at Citrus
Glen School in Ventura when he was stopped by a maintenance man for
not wearing his district-issued identification badge.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury report also found a majority of the county's
schools conduct regularly scheduled safety meetings and have
procedures in place for screening people who enter and leave campus.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to fencing, the report suggested high schools can
deter crime with surveillance cameras and full-time peace officers,
now in place at several area campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The report specifically notes the need for schools to adopt an
attitude described as "we are Columbine," in which educators
acknowledge that security measures are necessary in the safest of
neighborhoods, where crime may be low and family incomes high.</TE>
<TE>   It is a philosophy, the grand jury report states, that has been
utilized by Simi Valley and Royal high schools, which, like all
schools in the county, work closely with law enforcement to establish
safety plans.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura High officials said they met earlier this week after
receiving the report and plan to convene again next week to draft a
response. School officials are still debating the need and the cost,
Austin said.</TE>
<TE>   Nordhoff High Principal Dan Musick said his district is planning a
campus modernization project next year in which several buildings
would be reconfigured to essentially cocoon the campus.</TE>
<TE>   "It will make it much more difficult to get in," Musick said.</TE>

<HD>'Missing Body' Murder Trials Are on the Rise</HD>
<DH>Advances in crime lab and DNA technology aid prosecutors in
trying cases once considered rare and risky.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Long Beach real estate agent Bruce Koklich's wife failed to show
up for work on a Monday morning in August, he reported her missing
and offered a $100,000 reward for information on her whereabouts.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives launched an extensive search but didn't find Jana
Carpenter-Koklich. They did, however, discover drops of her blood in
her abandoned car and in the bedroom she shared with her husband.</LD>
<LD>   "In this case, it didn't take very long to make us start believing
that foul play was involved," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt.
Ray Peavy.</LD>
<TE>   Koklich was arrested in January on suspicion of his wife's murder,
even though her body never turned up. He is now out on bail awaiting
a preliminary hearing in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Once considered rare and risky, murder trials in cases in which
the bodies are missing are becoming increasingly common.</TE>
<TE>   Since the first "no body" conviction in the nation based solely on
circumstantial evidence in 1957, prosecutors have successfully tried
defendants in a number of such cases where victims were believed to
be dropped from airplanes, pushed into the ocean or buried next to
freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have been aided by advances in crime lab and DNA
technology that can link a suspect to a crime scene without a body.
They have also benefited from a change in attitude among some jurors,
who no longer consider a body critical evidence in a murder case.</TE>
<TE>   At least twice recently in Los Angeles County, defendants were
convicted despite missing bodies.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2000, a man was found guilty of kidnapping and
murdering his half sister, the wife of Los Lobos guitarist Cesar
Rosas.</TE>
<TE>   Later that same month, the victim's bones were found buried in the
Santa Clarita Valley after the killer told detectives where to look.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a Pomona woman and her live-in boyfriend were convicted
of murder and child abuse in the death of the woman's 3-year-old
daughter. The child's body was never found.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors acknowledge that it is still a challenge to try a
murder case without being able to show jurors photographs of the
victim's body or without presenting a medical examiner's testimony
about the autopsy.</TE>
<TE>   First they must persuade a jury that a murder has occurred before
they can go about proving who committed it.</TE>
<TE>   "The success rate is mixed," said Robert Pugsley, a professor at
Southwestern University School of Law.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the hardest things in the world is to convince a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt that the person killed somebody where the
[victim] was never found."</TE>
<TE>   Whether jurors are likely to accept that a murder victim could
simply vanish also depends on the defendant, Pugsley said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors might believe that a member of an organized crime ring or a
person with a lot of money could get rid of a body, he said, but they
might be less likely to think an average husband or wife could do the
same.</TE>
<TE>   To convince jurors that a murder has taken place, prosecutors say
the key is showing that the missing person's life came to a complete
and sudden halt.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter-Koklich, for example, was described by family and
friends as punctual, but authorities said she missed several
appointments and failed to return phone calls beginning the weekend
before her disappearance. She also apparently didn't contact her
father, former state Sen. Paul Carpenter, even though he was in very
poor health. She has not been heard from since.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles prosecutor Stephen Kay has stressed the everyday
routines of victims in the no-body cases he has tried.</TE>
<TE>   In one, Charles Manson associate Bruce Davis was convicted in 1972
of the murder of ranch hand Shorty Shea after Kay showed that Shea's
life routines had suddenly halted. Though a transient, Shea always
called his mother at Christmas, sent her candy on Mother's Day and
regularly bugged a producer friend for a job, Kay said.</TE>
<TE>   In such cases, prosecutors also rely more heavily on eyewitnesses,
incriminating statements and documents.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1957 case, L. Ewing Scott was convicted of murdering his
wealthy wife, Evelyn, who disappeared from their Bel-Air home two
years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors showed that Scott had been forging his wife's name on
checks for living expenses. The only remnants of the 63-year-old
woman were her eyeglasses and dentures buried under leaves on
property near her mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Scott was sentenced to life, but was freed in 1978. He died seven
years later.</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire Boys Club leader Joe Hunt was convicted in 1987 of
killing Beverly Hills con man Ron Levin, whose body was never found.
Prosecutors said Hunt killed Levin to avenge a high-stakes investment
hoax and raise funds for his business fraternity. Hunt was sentenced
to life without parole.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a Newport Beach man accused of killing his wife and
dumping her body into the ocean was convicted of first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argued that Eric Christopher Bechler killed his wife
to collect on her $2-million insurance policy. The key witness was
Bechler's girlfriend, who testified that he admitted murdering his
wife and making up a story about her falling into the sea. Bechler
was sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives who investigate cases of vanished persons consult with
the FBI, issue national bulletins and run checks on credit cards and
driver's licenses before concluding that the person is not alive.</TE>
<TE>   "In today's computerized world, records are kept of everything,"
Peavy said. "If there is absolutely no activity anywhere, it's like
checking that person's pulse and [discovering] they're dead."</TE>
<TE>   Often, the investigations produce physical evidence--a shoe print,
a hair, a tire track--that may make prosecutors' job a little easier.
But there is always the lingering doubt, the possibility that the
alleged victim could walk through the door, Peavy said.</TE>
<TE>   That can make for fascinating courtroom debate. In a 1985 case, a
defense attorney argued that there was no proof that her client, Musa
Has, 20, had killed Hollywood resident Marshall Sowder, 67, because
his body was never found.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Ray Mireles, in his closing argument, countered: "The
defense concludes maybe Marshall Sowder will come walking through the
door.... Well, with the evidence, I suspect that if Marshall Sowder
comes walking through the door, he'll be walking hand in hand with
Jimmy Hoffa."</TE>
<TE>   Has, who said Sowder never returned from a Hawaiian vacation, was
convicted of voluntary manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, jurors decide that the defendant has not committed
the murder or that prosecutors have failed to prove their case beyond
a reasonable doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Former Reseda auto shop owner Harvey Rader, for example, was
acquitted in 1992 of killing a former Israeli soldier and his family
in a case with a lack of bodies, weapons or eyewitnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Even when they do convict, jurors are hesitant to recommend the
death penalty in no-body cases.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a natural reluctance in imposing the ultimate punishment
on someone whose conviction rests on killing somebody who cannot be
found," Pugsley said.</TE>

<HD>Toll Board Sees a Merger as Cure for Ills</HD>
<DH>Roads: Underused, debt-ridden San Joaquin route would gain
in pact with busier Foothill and Eastern turnpikes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with a shortage of customers and dire financial warnings,
directors for the San Joaquin Hills toll road on Thursday authorized
a merger with a second county toll agency in an effort to deal with
the turnpike's growing debt.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous vote comes nearly three months after a major Wall
Street ratings agency downgraded more than $1 billion in San Joaquin
toll road bonds to junk status because traffic and revenue for the
15-mile highway continued to fall far short of projections.</LD>
<LD>   Board members for the second toll agency, which oversees the other
two Orange County tollways, the Eastern and Foothill, are scheduled
to cast a deciding vote on a merger June 13.</LD>
<TE>   The San Joaquin has struggled financially from the start, never
quite recovering from its early years, when revenue dipped to only
50% of projections.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of financial analysts, which examined the toll agency's
ledger books and recommended a merger, said that even with an
infusion of as much as $400 million, the agency would fail to
establish long-term financial stability.</TE>
<TE>   Directors of the San Joaquin were warned Thursday that without
quick action--such as a merger--the agency would miss crucial bond
payments as early as 2005 and would probably default by 2012 unless
revenue grew 11.5% annually.</TE>
<TE>   The toll for drivers on the San Joaquin was recently raised to a
maximum of $3 for a one-way trip, which could eventually generate
needed revenue--or, as some suggest, discourage customers. A further
rate hike is not anticipated right now.</TE>
<TE>   A merger of the two toll agencies, creating a single board and
combining all revenue and debt, would put the joint debt at roughly
$4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have previously worried that while a merger could prop up
the San Joaquin's sagging finances, it could drag down the more
successful Eastern and Foothill tollways.</TE>
<TE>   That second toll agency is operating at a much healthier 110% of
projected revenue. At least one of its board members is eager to
consider a merger.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the toll roads have been a success, and we want to
continue along in that vein," said Peter Herzog, a Lake Forest city
councilman. "This is just some of the bumps and grinds."</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin, which stretches from Newport Beach to San Juan
Capistrano, has had its share of bumps. In January, revenue was 82%
of projections but has since slipped to 77%, said board Chairwoman
Linda Lindholm, a Laguna Niguel city councilwoman.</TE>
<TE>   "Each month it went down, and when it hit 77%, I told myself I
don't think we are going to make our debt [payments]," Lindholm said.
"Now is the time to take these steps."</TE>
<TE>   If the board failed to act, it ran the risk of creating a domino
effect that could further erode Wall Street's ratings of the toll
bonds, undermine the agency's borrowing ability and affect other toll
agencies, analyst Mark T. Young said.</TE>
<TE>   Young said another ratings downgrade is likely without a merger.</TE>
<TE>   Previous downgrades have already hurt toll road investors by
lowering the value of $789 million in uninsured bonds issued in 1997
and $220 million in revenue bonds sold in 1993. An additional
$795million in San Joaquin Hills bonds sold by the agency in 1997
still retain an AAA rating because they are insured.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Diehl, chairman of the Foothill/Eastern toll board, said a
decision whether to merge will come down to "what is the best for all
of Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill/Eastern agency still hopes to add a 16-mile southern
extension that would eventually serve San Clemente and push into San
Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you what the vote will be in two months, but we
would be foolish if we didn't take a look at what is the best
structure for us," Diehl said. "We still have quite a bit of
[research] for our board to do."</TE>
<TE>   A merger would allow the joint $4 billion in debt to be
restructured under a new agency, analysts said. They added that
consolidation would add efficiency and streamline operations.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin toll road opened in 1996. After its first year,
revenue was 50% short of projections. Bonds had been sold in 1993
assuming that annual revenue would grow an average of 6.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The agency refinanced a majority of its debt in 1997, reducing the
interest rate from 7.6% to 5.7%, resulting in significant long-term
savings.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue and traffic have increased in recent years, but not
enough.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin board also instructed its staff to work with a
Foothill/Eastern agency committee to plan for a new board structure,
select traffic and revenue consultants and prepare a joint-powers
agreement.</TE>

<HD>Freight-Line Safeguards Fell Short</HD>
<DH>Crash: Investigators of the fatal Placentia wreck are
trying to determine why the train sped up at a yellow light instead
of slowing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON, ERIC MALNIC and TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Checks and balances established by Burlington Northern-Santa Fe to
make sure that train crews heed critical warning signals along the
track failed to prevent Tuesday's fatal crash of a freight train and
a Metrolink commuter train, investigators said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   BNSF procedures call for the conductor and engineer aboard trains
to call out the color of each track signal as they approach it, a
two-voice system meant to ensure that signals are not missed.</LD>
<LD>   The crew is also supposed to use a checklist to write down the
color of each signal as it is passed, according to BNSF engineers.</LD>
<TE>   Yet National Transportation Safety Board investigators said the
two-man crew did not heed a yellow signal about two miles from the
Placentia crash scene.</TE>
<TE>   The signal should have been visible from as far as a mile away,
according to one engineer who is familiar with the line.</TE>
<TE>   The yellow light called for the crew to slow to 30 mph, but the
train actually sped up to 48 mph, officials said. A minute and a half
later, the crew encountered a red signal but couldn't stop the train
before it slammed into a double-decker Metrolink train, killing two
passengers and injuring hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   "Both [crew members] are supposed to observe for the signal," said
lead federal investigator Mike Flanigon.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the things, an area, that we're certainly looking
at and trying to understand ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have ruled out mechanical problems and said there
was no evidence of a fire or other on-board emergency that would have
distracted the freight crew. They stressed that they have found no
indication of criminal wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators Thursday morning tested track conditions using
equipment identical to that involved in the crash. They found that
the signal lights were working and visible, though Flanigon said the
skies might have been more overcast Thursday than on the day of the
crash.</TE>
<TE>   One locomotive engineer who has participated in dozens of accident
investigations said the track approaching the signal lights does not
have sharp curves or bends that might have obstructed the crew's
view.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the train did not begin to slow until it reached the second
light, indicating that the crew might not have reacted before seeing
the Metrolink train on the track ahead, said the engineer, who spoke
on condition he not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't see how this could have happened," the engineer
said.</TE>
<TE>   The freight-train engineer, Darrell Wells, 48, of Dana Point, and
the conductor, Dean E. Tacoronte of Needles, both declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Flanigon said that Wells had several years' experience as a
conductor, but only about one year of experience as an engineer.</TE>
<TE>   He said the crew's work shift did not exceed federal guidelines,
although he noted that crew fatigue has been identified by the NTSB
as a problem in different areas of public transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Wells started work about 51/2 hours before Tuesday's 8:10 a.m.
crash and was off duty for the 221/2 hours before his shift began,
BNSF work schedules show. Before that, Wells worked a 12-hour shift
that ended about 4 a.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Tacoronte had been off for 101/2 hours before the shift began, the
records show. He worked a seven-hour shift the day before the crash,
and an eight-hour shift two days before.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators questioned the crew members Thursday but
declined to reveal what they said. Federal officials plan to review
their personnel files, including their training, experience, medical
histories and any prior incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Blood tests administered immediately after the crash, a routine
procedure after a major incident, showed no sign of alcohol use by
any crew member.</TE>
<TE>   Findings from the drug tests are expected to be released today.
Two commuters were killed in the Tuesday crash: Robert Kube, 59, of
Moreno Valley and Lawrence Sorensen, 48, of Riverside. Both men died
from blunt-trauma injuries. Flanigon said 159 people were treated for
injuries at 13 hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation at the scene wrapped up Thursday, Flanigon said,
and the first car from Train 809 was loaded aboard a flatbed truck to
be shipped to a Metrolink yard for further study.</TE>
<TE>   One of the questions is how passengers on Train 809's first car
were injured. Flanigon said investigators were interviewing
passengers to determine where they were seated.</TE>
<TE>   Some passengers on the train complained that their stomachs and
torsos had slammed into the tables between the train's benches.</TE>
<TE>   "The other work that will be ongoing will be to determine the
nature of the injuries, to look at where those people were sitting in
the car, how they might have been injured," Flanigon said.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea [is] to look at the equipment design to identify
anything that can ... improve the safety of the equipment."</TE>
<TE>   Initial findings could be completed in three months, and the final
report in nine months to a year.</TE>

<HD>Plan May Doom Fish</HD>
<DH>Klamath Basin: Report says irrigation could lead to
species' extinction, but official is optimistic about a solution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal biologists have tentatively concluded that two species of
endangered fish could face extinction if the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation proceeds with its 10-year plan to provide irrigation
water to farmers in the Klamath River Basin.</LD>
<LD>   Farmers have worried that the draft report, issued Thursday by the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, would cause water to be routed from
newly planted farm fields to benefit fish.</LD>
<LD>   A bureau spokesman expressed optimism, however, that the report
signals that a Draconian farmers-or-fish decision in allocating water
could be avoided.</LD>
<TE>   "We think this draft opinion provides us some flexibility to
provide irrigation water to our farmers and meet the needs for the
fishery," said the bureau's Jeff McCracken. A spokesman for the
farmers said Thursday that he had not yet seen the report.</TE>
<TE>   After public review and comments, a final report will be issued
June 1.</TE>
<TE>   The basin was racked by protests last summer when irrigation water
was held back from hundreds of farmers after the Fish and Wildlife
Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service concluded that the
94-year-old federal irrigation project aiding farmers was threatening
suckers and coho salmon with extinction.</TE>
<TE>   A 1995 federal solicitor's opinion states that endangered species
get priority for water in the basin, followed by Indian tribes who
fish for salmon and then by irrigators who supply the farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say the supply of water is far more plentiful
this year because of increased snowmelt and rain along the
Oregon-California border.</TE>
<TE>   But the basin is still not flush with water, and forecasts issued
April 17 predict that incoming water will be 73% of normal from April
to September.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from half a dozen federal agencies are now struggling to
satisfy the needs of water users up and down the Klamath River.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau of Reclamation officials already assured farmers they will
receive water. The bureau and wildlife regulators say they will work
together to devise ways to irrigate fields and protect the endangered
shortnose and Lost River suckers.</TE>
<TE>   The draft report describes ways the bureau could avoid driving the
fish toward extinction, such as adopting a more accurate formula for
predicting water flows.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Keppen, executive director of the Klamath Water Users Assn.,
representing farmers, said he had not yet seen the Fish and Wildlife
report and could not assess its potential impact on farmers.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he is waiting for a similar report from the National
Marine Fisheries Service on how the irrigation project would affect
threatened coho salmon that also depend on Klamath water. That report
was due out two weeks ago but has been twice delayed.</TE>

<AU>GEORGE WEIGEL</AU>
<BD>George Weigel is senior fellow of the Ethics and Public
Policy Center in Washington and author of "Witness to Hope: The
Biography of Pope John Paul II" (HarperCollins, 1999). He returned
Monday from Vatican City.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pope has flatly condemned clerical sexual abuse. The American
cardinals have met in Rome to get strict clergy personnel policies on
a fast track to Vatican approval. Every senior leader in the Catholic
Church is now focused intensely on the crisis.</LD>
<LD>   In this moment of pause between the historic Vatican meetings this
week and the U.S. bishops' June meeting in Dallas, could everyone
please take a deep breath so that a few essential points can be
clarified?</LD>
<LD>   * This is not a pedophilia crisis. It is a crisis of sexual abuse,
which takes three forms.</LD>
<TE>   Pedophilia, or sexual predation on prepubescent children, is the
most revolting expression of clerical sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The age-old problem of priestly misbehavior with women is another
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Report after report over the past four months has made
unmistakably clear, however, that the overwhelming majority of
clerical sexual predators in recent decades are homosexual priests
abusing teenage boys and young men.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops faced this in Rome, and it is high time that the media
face it too.</TE>
<TE>   Headlines and television teasers about the "pedophilia crisis" or
"child sexual abuse crisis" are false and misleading.</TE>
<TE>   * It is no accident that the bulk of the abuse cases recently
reported took place between the mid-1960s and the late 1980s, a
period in which a culture of dissent took root in American
seminaries, theology faculties and church bureaucracies and in which
clerical discipline broke down.</TE>
<TE>   There can be no question that this culture of dissent contributed
massively to a breakdown of discipline, which in turn contributed to
a serious outbreak of clerical sexual abuse. Men who adopted habits
of intellectual self-deception in the seminary--pretending to accept
church teachings that they really didn't believe and had no intention
of teaching--are more likely to lead lives of self-deception in their
sexual conduct.</TE>
<TE>   By the same token, it is no accident that there have been few
cases of clerical sexual abuse reported from the 1990s, when the
reform of the seminaries that was demanded by Pope John Paul II began
to take hold and when most bishops in the United States adopted
stringent policies for dealing with abusers.</TE>
<TE>   * This is not a crisis of celibacy. It is a crisis caused by men
failing to live the celibacy that they solemnly promised to God and
the church.</TE>
<TE>   A quick glance at the national registry of sex offenders
demonstrates that sexual abusers often are married men; indeed, most
sexual abuse takes place within families.</TE>
<TE>   This is a crisis of priestly identity. Ill-prepared priests who
were not taught to live chastely and who thought of themselves
primarily as religious functionaries were not going to weather the
storms of our sex-saturated culture.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, priests who really believe that they are what the
Catholic Church teaches they are--living icons of the eternal
priesthood of Christ--do not behave as sexual predators.</TE>
<TE>   * It has been widely suggested that the Vatican meetings this week
produced another waffle. They did not.</TE>
<TE>   A careful reading of the cardinals' statement makes clear that
there will be zero tolerance for true pedophiles (past, present and
future) and zero tolerance for serial sexual abusers (past, present
and future).</TE>
<TE>   The remaining question is what is to be done in the case of a
priest who falls from grace once, repents, truly amends his life and
lives his vows of celibate chastity in integrity for years or
decades.</TE>
<TE>   If that fall involved genuine pedophilia, my sense is that the
bishops still would want to depose him, as indeed they should; some
actions disqualify a man from further ministry, period.</TE>
<TE>   But should such a "one strike and you're out" policy extend to a
priest who had a brief consensual affair with a woman a
quarter-century ago and has led an exemplary life since? Most
Catholics would probably say no, and they would be right.</TE>
<TE>   This is, at bottom, a crisis of fidelity. It will not be resolved
by the church adopting a "Catholic Lite" strategy--abandoning
priestly celibacy, dumbing down Catholic sexual ethics--as
progressive joy riders on the crisis are suggesting.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic Lite helped cause the crisis. The path to genuine reform
is for the church to become more Catholic, not less.</TE>

<HD>Blacks Would Pay a Price for Secession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERWIN CHEMERINSKY</AU>
<BD>Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at
USC, conducted an independent review of the LAPD Board of Inquiry's
report on the Rampart scandal for the Police Protective League.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The decision to deny LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks a second term
revealed once again a city deeply divided along racial lines. For
example, the political fallout from the fight over Parks, and more
generally from the continuing racial chasm in Los Angeles, is
surfacing in the bitter fight over secession. It also sure to affect
the battle over the selection of Parks' replacement and future races
for the City Council and mayor.</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, the decision about Parks would seem to have
little to do with the likely vote in November as to whether the San
Fernando Valley, and perhaps other areas, will secede. But the fight
over Parks could greatly affect, if not ultimately decide, Valley
secession.</LD>
<LD>   The African American community in Los Angeles resides almost
entirely in the area that would remain in Los Angeles if secession
occurs. Some African American leaders have suggested that blacks
might be better off politically being a larger percentage of a
smaller city. Losing the fight over Parks' reappointment may be
perceived as a reflection of dwindling African American political
influence and thus generate black support for secession.</LD>
<TE>   The irony is that part of the impetus for secession has come from
some whites in the San Fernando Valley who would prefer to be in a
new city in which whites are a majority.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, secession must be approved both by a majority of
those voting in the area that is seeking to become a separate city
and also by a majority of all voting in the entire city. Strong
African American support for secession could tip the balance in the
latter vote in favor of breaking up Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But secession would come at a high price for the African American
community. Supporters of Valley secession repeatedly claim that the
Valley pays more in taxes than it receives in city services. If so,
then losing this tax base obviously would hurt the rest of Los
Angeles. The result likely would mean less revenues for the city and
therefore less government services.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, a smaller Los Angeles might be much worse off in
competing for funds from Washington and Sacramento. The African
American communities in Los Angeles long have received less than
their fair share of city services; they could end up with even less
if secession is approved.</TE>
<TE>   If the defeat of Parks for a second term increases the likelihood
of Valley secession, then Mayor James Hahn's opposition to Parks
could be his political undoing. Hahn was elected last June by a
coalition primarily consisting of African American voters and those
in the West Valley. Hahn, who received 82% of the black vote, has
greatly angered this core constituency. Without substantial black
support and without the Valley vote, it is almost impossible to see
Hahn being reelected.</TE>
<TE>   Underneath the surface of all of this is a growing divide between
the African American and Latino communities in Los Angeles. For
example, there were sharp disagreements along racial lines in the
commissions considering new election districts for both the City
Council and the Los Angeles Unified School District. Secession
probably would lessen the political power of the Latino community,
which would be split between the East Valley in the new city and East
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   All this creates a complicated and troubling political and racial
picture. This must be dealt with, not ignored. First, those opposing
secession need to make a compelling case that the African American
community would be hurt if the city broke apart.</TE>
<TE>   The supporters of secession offer an idealized vision of a
smaller, more responsive city. Foes of secession need better answers
and need to emphasize the great uncertainty over the costs of
secession, especially in the provision of government services.</TE>
<TE>   Great care also must be taken so that the search for a new police
chief not become a racial battle ground. The Police Commission needs
to articulate clear criteria for evaluating candidates and needs to
be sure that all communities have input in the selection process.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, efforts must be made to heal the wounds caused by the
bitter fight over Parks' reappointment and the growing division
between African Americans and Latinos. There are not easy solutions,
but ignoring these problems won't make them go away.</TE>

<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody talks about honor anymore, certainly not male honor, so this
is going to sound very old-fashioned. And nobody, except the hippest,
most artfully abstruse academics, thinks of wars in terms of gender
paradigms.</LD>
<LD>   But the war on terror is just such a war. It's a war about
cultural masculinity, ours versus theirs.</LD>
<LD>   Western masculinity is in remarkably good shape at present. Part
of the reason is, of course, that physical bravery, one of the
cardinal masculine virtues of old, is popular again after Sept.
11--more popular, one could argue, than it has been since the sexual
revolution of the 1970s. Suddenly everybody understands why it's not
such a bad idea to have a few stolid, burly guys in uniform around
when the enemy attacks. It seems to have finally dawned on us that
machismo has its upside, a considerable one, in fact, that might just
save us in a crunch.</LD>
<TE>   Interestingly, American masculinity wouldn't have come out looking
so good on Sept. 11 if it hadn't been thriving on Sept. 10. Those
men--and a few women--ran into those burning buildings because their
cultural cues told them it was their duty to do so. I am
distinguishing here between gender (masculinity or femininity) and
sex (maleness or femaleness); gender being cultural, sex being
biological. Thus in both men and women, cultural masculinity had been
provided an outlet in the form of a firefighter's or a police
officer's uniform. Those people knew what they were supposed to do,
what they instinctively felt inclined to do, and they did it. Both
they and society benefited as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Consider, by contrast, an equivalent situation in the Arab world:
the unveiled girls who were caught recently in a fire at their school
in Saudi Arabia. Because the girls were not dressed in proper hijab,
male rescuers did not go in to rescue them. Their fragile
masculinity--the same fragile masculinity that has led Muslim clerics
for generations to opportunistically misinterpret the Koran's
teachings on women--also prevented them from saving innocent lives.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the same insecure and thwarted masculinity that compels
so many Muslim extremists to oppress women also may be what compels
them to commit acts of terror such as the string of senseless suicide
bombings that Palestinians, both men and now a few women, have
committed in Israel. We have heard many reports in the past seven
months of high unemployment in the Arab world coupled with huge
population of people under 25. This is true in the West Bank and Gaza
as well. Should we be surprised when this results in violence? Take
crowds of young men, give them nothing to do, no hope for the future,
someone to blame for their misfortunes and no outlet for their
masculine instincts, and you have a breeding ground for terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Much as we may not like to admit that we are animals, naturalists
and researchers have emphasized that unsocialized males are
dangerous. In parts of Africa and Asia, for example, certain
elephants have been known to attack and even kill other animals,
unusual behavior for this generally docile, nonpredatory mammal.
After researching the phenomenon, specialists found that the
marauding culprits or "rogue" elephants were males who had been
improperly socialized as a result of having left the matriarchal
elephant society at too young an age and having gone unsupervised for
too long.</TE>
<TE>   Are we immune to such an outcome simply by virtue of being human?
Many studies of adolescent boys have shown that we are not.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, there is a place for the classic masculine virtues--for
courage and strength and unflinching resolve in the face of
danger--in any civilized society, This has been true throughout human
history, embodied in the three major monotheistic faiths, all of
which are patriarchal. But fundamentalist Islam has gone to
misogynistic extremes--a bad sign for the state of Islamist
masculinity.</TE>
<TE>   When religion and culture clash and the balance of instinct and
socialization is offset, disaster results. That is why we are
unlikely to solve our terror problem until the Middle East solves its
masculinity problem.</TE>

<HD>Car Makers' Vintage Whine</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When regulators began cleaning up auto exhaust 30 years ago, the
reaction from the car makers was that it couldn't be done. When cars
were required to have catalytic converters, one industry executive
said the cost could mean "business catastrophe."</LD>
<LD>   General Motors claimed their customers didn't want seat belts and
that air bags "are not viable because they are not economically
practical." In recent weeks, as the U.S. Senate debated proposed new
fuel mileage standards (which were ultimately voted down), the auto
makers claimed that stricter standards would make the sport utility
vehicle extinct and put soccer moms at risk in tinny little unsafe
vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   And here they go again. The same hyperventilated claims are being
made in Sacramento as the state Senate considers AB 1058, by
Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills).</LD>
<TE>   The measure requires the state Air Resources Board to adopt
standards for controlling carbon dioxide in auto emissions, a modest
but important effort to attack the problem of global warming. True,
California can't stop global warming on its own, but it can lead the
pack in cleaning up emissions, as it always has.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that no standard would be fixed before 2004 or become
effective until the 2008 model year; the auto makers are screaming
that they can't do it. They claim the bill "would destroy consumer
choice and destroy entire fleets of vehicles." An industry ad
campaign warns of higher gas taxes, reduced speed limits, a "tax on
driving" and "fees on new vehicles." There is no evidence the bill
would result in any of these things.</TE>
<TE>   The auto makers claim the only way to get better gas mileage is to
build little, lightweight vehicles--that beloved SUVs would be
reduced to virtual golf carts. But the technology exists to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions in other ways. European car makers have
agreed to cut such emissions by 25% by 2008. They already have
reduced them by 6%, and their vehicles got heavier and more powerful,
not less.</TE>
<TE>   AB 1058 gives the manufacturers wide latitude in developing the
technology. Hybrid electric SUVs, for instance, are already in the
works. The standards would have to be cost-effective and
technologically feasible and not cause harm to the California
economy.</TE>
<TE>   The auto makers' response is the same old cry of wolf. Can't be
done. Costs too much. But somehow seat belts and air bags and
previous emission controls got done, and cars and trucks are better
than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee can continue this
long, fruitful crusade for a better and safer environment by
approving AB 1058 when it considers the measure, as early as Monday.</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates was combative and evasive in his 1998
testimony in the federal antitrust trial of the giant software
company. Wearing casual clothes and rocking back and forth, he
suffered what appeared to be frequent bouts of amnesia. In his
testimony this week, Gates was much more refined, wearing elegant
outfits chosen by his wife, summoning a sharp memory and at least
initially responding ''Yes, sir!'' to his questioners.</LD>
<LD>   Although Gates' demeanor was more stylish, his insistence that
Microsoft had not tried to squash competition was no more believable
than three years ago. His ultimately obstinate testimony underscores
why U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly should reject
the toothless proposed federal settlement with Microsoft. Microsoft's
own vice president in charge of Windows, Christopher R. Jones,
admitted to her Thursday that the federal plan would do nothing to
loosen the company's vise-tight control of the PC software market.</LD>
<TE>   Gates began his testimony by dismissing the states' key
demand--that Kollar-Kotelly allow PC makers to equip units with a
stripped-down version of Windows that would allow consumers to choose
which components to add. Gates testified that removing any part of
the inseparable Windows operating system would so afflict the "health
of the PC ecosystem" that it would force him to withdraw from the
market the software on which 95% of the world's computers depend. Oh,
right. And maybe he will also hold his breath until his face turns
blue.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, however, even Gates was forced to admit that his
firm already made a bare-bones operating system--called Windows XP
Embedded--that did just what the states had asked. Consumers can't
use Windows XP Embedded, not because doing so would plunge the world
into chaos but because Microsoft's truculent licensing terms bar
consumers from running the system on PCs.</TE>
<TE>   If Judge Kollar-Kotelly rejects the federal settlement, as she
should, she will have to choose among the 19 extremely complex
alternative remedies suggested by the states. While she won't be able
to satisfy all of the states' demands, Windows XP Embedded gives her
at least one alluringly simple and elegant solution.</TE>
<TE>   If ordinary consumers had access to it, they could avoid
"bloatware"--the unrequested features that average people never use
but that are likely to make their PCs crash. Consumers could build
truly personal computers--machines designed not to extend one
company's stifling dominion but rather to meet their own day-to-day
needs.</TE>

<LD>After 37 years as a pioneer within the Los Angeles Police Department,
Chief Bernard C. Parks exits Parker Center four months before the
scheduled end of his five-year term. He wisely has decided not to
pursue a pointless legal battle against the Police Commission's
refusal to reappoint him. His retirement, which in effect takes place
next week with the start of a long vacation, requires the city to
speed up the selection of the next chief.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Chief Mike Bostic will be in charge until the Police
Commission chooses an interim chief. Meanwhile, a head-hunting firm
hired by the city's personnel department will conduct a nationwide
search for candidates to  lead the Police Department. The selection
of the next chief will also be guided by a blue- ribbon panel of
citizens selected by commissioners. Two members of the commission
will join that panel as it develops criteria for a new chief.</LD>
<LD>   The next chief must complete the job of reform; in the context of
the LAPD, that means showing by example that the department must
answer to civilian oversight. But before that can happen, the next
chief must focus on boosting officer morale and improving day-to-day
police work in order to fight crime.</LD>
<TE>   In talking about his plans, Parks said city secession "is the most
important issue confronting the city.... I want to evaluate the pros
and cons so that I will be able to influence others to vote
appropriately on this issue." We hope the chief will indeed study the
issue, because when he does we believe he will conclude that the
splitting of Los Angeles would not enhance crime prevention and
policing; a former police chief would be in a unique position to make
that case.</TE>
<TE>   Parks will also consider a run for the 8th City Council District,
in South and southwest Los Angeles. If he decides to seek elected
office, Parks will need to demonstrate that he has more on his mind

appointment to a second term. Parks would have to show how he would
address the various needs of that community.</TE>
<TE>   As he begins a new chapter of an already political life, Chief
Parks is free to leave bitterness behind and look forward to playing
a constructive role in the region, through public life or private
enterprise.</TE>

<LD>Re "'Slave of Allah' Wounds Justice," Commentary, April 23: We read
of Zacarias Moussaoui on trial for complicity in the monstrous crime
of Sept. 11. Uncooperative, vituperative behavior and rejection of
court-appointed legal counsel may, it is said, earn him the death
penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Could this be exactly what the defendant is trying to achieve?
Imagine the worldwide uproar, not just in Arab states, if we were to
execute or incarcerate a Muslim based on what is said to be
circumstantial evidence. Martyrdom on a colossal scale! If there are
any doubts about this person's guilt, he should be well-photographed
and fingerprinted, have a DNA sample taken and then be ejected to his
country of origin.</LD>

<TE>   People can try to understand the terrorists' position all they
want, but here you have an actual terrorist, Moussaoui, describing it
in his own words ("Moussaoui Says He Prays for U.S. Ruin," April 23).
They're not just against Israel, or just against Israel and the U.S.
Moussaoui "called upon Allah to vanquish the non-Muslim forces in the
world." So that's our crime. We're not Muslims. And for that the
terrorists would like to condemn us to death.</TE>
<TE>   People don't want to believe that the terrorists just want to kill
everybody who isn't part of their own little group, but there it is.
That's their plan. It isn't about peace on Earth. It isn't about the
Palestinians. It's just a stupid plan to kill everybody who's not a
Muslim.</TE>

<TE>   As an American and a Jew, I am appalled that U.S. District Judge
Leonie Brinkema would even consider allowing Moussaoui, a man whose
quest is for the destruction of America and Jews everywhere, to rule
our courts. How dare we allow Moussaoui to call the shots in our
court of law?</TE>
<TE>   To allow his request of a computer in his jail cell, or consider
allowing a nonjury trial, makes me angry, frustrated and dumbfounded.
How do we allow a person of this hate mentality the availability of a
computer? Trust me, if there is a way to spread the "word," this
hatemonger will find it. Daniel Pearl should have been as lucky. Just
think, if he could have availed himself of a computer, maybe he would
be alive today.</TE>

<HD>Nixon Library Reveals the Family History</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "2 Nixon Daughters, 1 Big Feud," April 23: I was somewhat
astounded about how Richard Nixon's daughters, Tricia and Julie, were
engaged in a family fist-fight over the control of the Nixon library
in Yorba Linda. I was never a fan of President Nixon, but I visited
the library a couple of years ago. The nine-acre setting is elegant
and appropriate. The staff was courteous and informative. The
exhibits were interesting, and on the subject of the Watergate
scandal, the library doesn't pull any punches. The institution deals
directly with the subject and clearly displays information about the
burglary and subsequent cover-up that destroyed his presidency. It is
a great history lesson for all to see.</LD>
<LD>   My late father, who had an eighth-grade education and became a
self-made man in the garment industry, once told me that "if it ain't
broke, don't fix it" and "never do business with your relatives."
Sage advice. Too bad the Nixon daughters don't seem to have my dad's
common sense.</LD>
<LD>   Arthur A. Lord</LD>
<TE>   Tarzana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nixon was bright and insightful about others but blind to himself
and a paranoid control freak. The negative parts of his personality
brought his presidency down. It looks like his daughters inherited
the same characteristics in differing proportions. It's ironic that
his library is suffering from an ignominious battle--just as his
presidency did--because of the flaws in his personality that he
passed on to his daughters.</TE>

<LD>Re "2 Die, Hundreds Hurt as Trains Crash Head-On," April 24:
Automobiles, trucks and airplanes have seat belts. Why don't trains
and buses (especially school buses)? How many of the dead and injured
in Placentia would have suffered less if they had been wearing seat
belts? Beyond the physical and emotional loss, consider the cost to
Metrolink of all these insurance claims.</LD>

<LD>   Woodland Hills</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why isn't there a federal system of rail traffic control as there
is for air traffic? Shouldn't train engineers be able to speak
directly with each other as well as with dispatchers or controllers?
The system of block signals is at least a century old. Surely we can
do something better than that. For example, very inexpensive GPS
satellite technology could be used to determine the exact location of
every train in the country. Perhaps if the driver of the commuter
train had known that the freight train was on the same track, and had
the two drivers been in communication with each other, the accident
could have been avoided.</TE>

Jon Diamond and his clients were as concerned with the quality of
life in the communities that their type of business destroys. Do we
really believe they are concerned for our environment? The businesses
that Diamond represents wreak havoc on every community in which they

<LD>I am in full agreement with John Balzar's April 25 column on
motorcycle noise. For some reason, these riders think they have a
right to make such excessive noise, noise that causes conversations
to stop, people to cringe and cover their ears and sets off auto
alarms. This is a problem in my Long Beach neighborhood of Belmont
Shore/Belmont Heights, where I have brought it to the attention of my
councilman and the local police. One merchant whom I communicated
with was afraid there might be retaliation if he asked them to be
respectful of the neighborhood.</LD>

<LD>Chris Kraul and William Orme's April 21 news analysis of the damage
caused by the Bush administration's mishandling of the coup in
Venezuela demonstrates the failure of the Machiavellian "ad hoc-ism"
advocated by the Kissinger school of thought. The United States is
strongest when we are true to the very principles upon which this
nation was founded. It is for that reason there are streets, squares
and even children all over the globe named after American leaders who
stood true to these principles.</LD>

<LD>I wonder if those who truly care about the Palestinian people will
put as much pressure on the Arab and Muslim leaders to help build a
peace-loving state as they put on Israel to let the bomb factories
and terrorists prevail. Will they pressure the world leaders to
ensure the financial donations to the Palestinians are being used to
build a decent community, or will they remain silent as the money is
funneled for suicide/homicide bomb belts and the like? Will the
Palestinians start teaching their children to work together with
Israel and engage in meaningful dialogue, or will they continue to
teach them that murdering their own children and other innocent
Israelis is honorable?</LD>
<LD>   Israel has no imperialistic intentions and will pull out and stay
out of the refugee camps so long as the murdering of innocent
Israelis stops. Israel will continue to strive to negotiate a peace
settlement. What can we look forward to from the Palestinian
leadership?</LD>

<TE>   Your April 24 article on the vicious Palestinian justice meted out
on the supposed Israeli collaborators misses the point. The brutal
and cowardly murder of these people reflects the total lack of
morality and justice that is characteristic of the Palestinian
Authority. To blame it on the void created by the Israeli incursions
is biased reporting. If this is really true, then how come this sort
of thing happened repeatedly before Operation Defensive Shield was
carried out?</TE>

<TE>   I share Robert Scheer's viewpoint (Commentary, April 23) that "the
truths on both sides of this war are unfathomably ugly" and "the
media have performed a great service in alerting the world to them."
But he seems to imply that the great majority of Jews in the U.S.,
Israel and worldwide condone the actions of Ariel Sharon and the
Israeli army. Just because the hawks are more vocal does not
necessarily mean they are the majority. There must be countless Jews
in Israel and throughout the world who are horrified not only by the
suicide-homicide bombers but by the Israeli response in decimating
entire villages and their frequently innocent inhabitants.
Unfortunately, they have apparently chosen to be a "silent majority."</TE>

<TE>   While sympathizing with the innocent Palestinians in Jenin, I
think their misery and the recent bloodshed were brought to them by
no one but Yasser Arafat and his fanatic Islamic groups, who envision
peace through violence, not the negotiating tables. Anyone believing
in global peace and security, as well as human life, must condemn
terrorism and not ever support it as a legitimate tactic. Israel is
fighting in self-defense, as any other country would. If Islamic
militants had not used the innocent Palestinian kids, men and women
as their protective shields, hostage in their homes, we would have
not witnessed Jenin's severe casualties.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am outraged that UC Davis has shown such insensitivity to the 105
students who were erroneously sent letters of acceptance ("High
School Student From Germany Appeals UC Davis Acceptance Foul-Up,"
April 20). The clerical error was the fault of the university, as it
readily acknowledged. As the mother of a freshman at UC Berkeley, I
know firsthand the pressures young people face today in choosing a
college.</LD>
<LD>   Why should the young student from Germany have to endure even
greater stress as a consequence of this bureaucratic mistake? His
3.73 GPA and 1150 SAT score were below the median for incoming
freshmen at Davis, but were they lower than all the other students
who were correctly accepted? The article states that few appeals are
ever granted this late in the selection process, but in view of the
school's culpability, I think that this young man and the other
students should be admitted as provisional and allowed to prove
themselves worthy of continuing there just like all the other
incoming freshmen.</LD>

Dean (letter, April 22). Well, considering the large increase in the

accumulating wealth.</LD>

there, Los Angeles detectives said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Merced de los Santos, 56, was charged with murder in 1986 by Los
Angeles County prosecutors after witnesses identified him as the man
who shot an acquaintance, 26-year-old Francisco Esparza, during an
argument.</LD>

resident saw the case profiled on "America's Most Wanted" and gave
police an address in Mexico.</LD>

<DH>Legislature: California falls in line on increased
contribution limits for 401(k) and individual retirement plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI and MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- State lawmakers approved legislation Thursday that will
allow millions of Californians to contribute more money tax-free to
401(k) plans, individual retirement accounts and education IRAs.</LD>
<LD>   Bills introduced by Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett (D-San Leandro)
and Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena) change the state's tax code so that
it conforms with federal tax incentives adopted last year.</LD>
<LD>   The state's delay in making the changes has created confusion and
anxiety for many Californians, who feared their 401(k) contributions,
for example, were in jeopardy of being disqualified if they took
advantage of the federal enhancements.</LD>
<TE>   "This is important for every Californian who is worried about
their retirement and who is concerned about saving for their
children's education," said Corbett, chairwoman of the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee, of her AB 1122. "These issues hit
home in just about every household in the state."</TE>
<TE>   Scott said the disparity addressed with his SB 657 has "drawn more
mail and constituent response than any other issue this year."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation touches tax-conscious Californians in a key way:
It allows them to reap benefits from the federal changes on both
their federal and state tax bills. Both measures make the conformity
changes retroactive to Jan. 1, which will be reflected on returns
filed by next April.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis is expected to sign both pieces of legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have new federal laws to allow individuals to put more
into deferred savings for their retirements, it makes sense to
conform at the state level," Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal law will boost allowable contributions to IRAs from
$2,000 to $5,000 by 2004, and to educational IRAs from $500 to
$2,000. It also will increase annual limits for contributions to
401(k), 403(b) and 457 retirement plans from $10,500 to $15,000 by
2006.</TE>
<TE>   Without the conforming actions by the state, a Californian who
contributed $3,000 this year to a tax-deductible IRA--the maximum
tax-free contribution for federal tax purposes, up from last year's
$2,000 limit--could expect to pay state taxes on the $1,000
difference.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers previously sent Davis another conformity bill by
Corbett, AB 131, which makes it easier for public employees to take
pension assets with them as they move from public- to private-sector
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The tax conformity legislation sailed through the Senate but met
resistance in the Assembly from Republicans, who floated a series of
amendments to eliminate what they argued were six tax increases
embedded in the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear the taxpayers of this state cannot count on this
Legislature to protect them," said Assemblyman Russ Bogh (R-Cherry
Valley), who reminded lawmakers that Davis has pledged not to support
tax increases this election season.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, who hold a 50-30 majority in the Assembly, rebutted the
Republican arguments and defeated the amendments, saying the measures
simply mirrored the federal changes. Both bills ultimately passed on
a 42-17 party-line vote.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the dispute was whether short-term revenue increases
resulting from the changes represent a tax increase.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans called the measure a tax hike because it would
initially result in a windfall of more than $260 million to state
coffers. They charged Democrats with structuring the cash flow to
help combat this year's massive state budget shortfall. Democrats
noted the treasury gains would be short-lived and said the measure
would result in little to no increase in tax revenue over time and
would actually cost the state tax revenues in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   Corbett emphasized the need for lawmakers to find a way to conform
to the federal rules without further exacerbating the state's
financial situation. California is expected to face a budget
shortfall of $20 billion or more.</TE>

<HD>Woman Found Guilty of Extortion</HD>
<DH>Court: She is the fifth in an Armenian crime ring convicted
in a plot against a businessman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal jury on Thursday convicted the last of five Armenian
organized crime figures accused of carrying out a kidnap-extortion
plot against a prominent Armenian businessman who arrived in the
United States seeking political asylum.</LD>
<LD>   Sousanna Ounousian, 38, of Van Nuys was found guilty of extortion,
conspiracy to commit extortion, and receiving the proceeds of
extortion, after a 10-day trial in Los Angeles federal court.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian set a July 22 sentencing
date for Ounousian, who faces up to 45 years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   The target of the plot was Armen Karakhanyan, a once well-to-do
businessman in Armenia who fled to the United States two years ago
after being imprisoned for speaking out against the government there.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving in Los Angeles, Karakhanyan was introduced to Ounousian
and the others, who volunteered to help him in settling.</TE>
<TE>   But early last year, authorities said, the businessman's new
friends turned on him, demanding that he help them in a bogus
check-cashing scheme.</TE>
<TE>   The ring members knew where the rest of his family was living in
Moscow, and warned that he would face the same kind of trouble he
encountered in Armenia unless he cooperated.</TE>
<TE>   Over a six-week period, Karakhanyan cashed a number of bad checks
at his bank, giving the proceeds to Ounousian, according to Assistant
U.S. Attys. James Aquilina and Brian Hoffstadt. Ordered next to cash
a large, fraudulent check drawn on a Spanish bank, Karakhanyan
instead went into hiding in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   The extortionists suspected that he had fled to Moscow, where his
wife, Elmira, was living. Investigators said the ring arranged for
associates in Russia to kidnap Karakhanyan and force him to return to
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, several unidentified men invaded his wife's
apartment and abducted a man they thought was Karakhanyan. It was a
cousin. In several phone calls to Karakhanyan's wife, the kidnappers
threatened to kill the cousin unless their demands were met.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Karakhanyan contacted the FBI. Under the agency's
protection, he returned to Los Angeles and resumed his dealings with
members of the ring, who now claimed he owed them $144,000. Despite
repeated threats, authorities said, Karakhanyan continued to meet
with the suspects until the FBI gathered enough evidence to obtain an
indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Ounousian was the only one to go to trial. The four others pleaded
guilty to charges ranging from extortion to hostage-taking conspiracy
and await sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   They are: Ounousian's husband, Pogos Ketchedjian, 39, of Van Nuys;
Ashot Manukyan, 48, of Los Feliz; Hovannes Igarian, 38, of Los Feliz;
and Hovsep Keshishian, 36, of Glendale.</TE>

<HD>Execution Sought in Van Dam Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Suspect charged in kidnapping, murder of the
7-year-old girl faces trial next month. A gag order is imposed.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors announced Thursday they will seek the death penalty for
David Westerfield in the kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Danielle
van Dam, who disappeared from her home Feb. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed engineer, lived two doors from
the Van Dam family in the upscale Sabre Springs neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst opted to seek the death penalty "after
full and careful consideration," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek.</LD>
<TE>   At the same court hearing, defense attorneys surprised Superior
Court Judge William Mudd by saying they will not seek to delay the
trial, which is scheduled to begin May 17.</TE>
<TE>   "In my 30 years in law, I have never heard of a death penalty case
in this or any community to go [to trial] this quickly," Mudd said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has ruled that the trial can be shown on television,
Mudd has continued to seal pretrial motions.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said trying to control what information is released in
the case "is like trying to control Jell-O. Once you think you have
it contained, it oozes out somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield also is charged with a misdemeanor count of possession
of child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd ruled that the defense cannot have copies of the pornography
allegedly seized from their client's home computer.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek had told Mudd that it would be improper for prosecutors to
provide copies of the child pornography because duplicating such
material is illegal.</TE>
<TE>   He added that prosecutors at trial will introduce evidence showing
Westerfield retained pictures of underage girls "engaged in sexual
positions."</TE>
<TE>   Mudd also imposed a gag order on all lawyers and witnesses.</TE>

<DH>Services: Senior center volunteers go grocery shopping for
those unable to leave home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nina Mageary can play with her grandchildren, chat with her neighbors
and watch TV. But she can't go grocery shopping.</LD>
<LD>   About a year ago, the 80-year-old North Hollywood resident had a
stroke. Not long after, her doctor advised against driving.</LD>
<LD>   "He said I might get dizzy and not know when [the dizziness] was
coming on," the small woman with shoulder-length white hair and warm
blue eyes said while seated at her kitchen table.</LD>
<TE>   At first, Mageary's son and daughter helped. They would go to
Smart &amp; Final and buy loads of groceries. Too many, Mageary said.</TE>
<TE>   But since her son and daughter each had a small child and other
responsibilities, it became difficult for them to continue the
shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Mageary found herself in a bind, until, out of the blue, she got a
call from the East Valley Multipurpose Senior Center in North
Hollywood, informing her that there were volunteers ready to pick up
her shopping list and money, buy her groceries, bring them back and
chat for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Six months since she took the center up on its offer, Mageary
looks forward to visits from volunteer Tanya Russell every other
week. The two women, one of eight pairs matched through the center,
talk on the phone and make an appointment for their grocery day.</TE>
<TE>   Participation is beneficial for the volunteers and the seniors,
center officials say. The volunteers do something that makes them
feel good, the seniors get help with a basic necessity, and both gain
lasting friendships.</TE>
<TE>   Lynda Schwartz, the center's shopping coordinator, said she just
wishes more seniors would participate.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to recruit seniors, believe it or not, because we
have the volunteers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Russell arrived at Mageary's Bellingham Avenue home
at 10:20 a.m. to go over the list. It had the usual items: coleslaw,
blueberry muffins, tissues. By 11 a.m., Russell, 75 and newly retired
from her job as a community college financial aid officer, was at a
Ralphs store two blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the layout very well," Russell said. "I just zip through."</TE>
<TE>   After checking out, Russell stopped to explain why she enjoys
grocery shopping for Mageary.</TE>
<TE>   When she was growing up in the Bronx, Russell said, she lived on
the top floor of an apartment building, just above two elderly women
who paid her 25 cents to do their shopping.</TE>
<TE>   A quarter was a lot to a 13-year-old girl back then, said Russell,
who often clips coupons for Mageary's favorite items while flipping
through her Sunday paper. "That's when I learned to comparison shop,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Back at Mageary's house by 11:30 a.m., Russell unpacked the
groceries. She said shopping for her friend is no chore.</TE>
<TE>   "I really, really like her," she said. "This is a win-win
situation. I get what I want. She gets what she wants."</TE>

<HD>Sepulveda Corridor Gets First of 5,000 New Trees</HD>
<DH>Arbor Day: The planting of 27 purple leaf plums is part of
plan to add shade and beauty along the boulevard from Mission Hills
to Harbor City. Mayor praises effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In honor of Arbor Day today, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn
displayed the first of about 5,000 shade trees Thursday that will be
planted along Sepulveda Boulevard from Mission Hills to Harbor City.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not only going to beautify the area, but will help clean
up air pollution and provide shade, which will help with energy
conservation," Hahn told residents and city officials gathered along
a median in Van Nuys, where 27 purple leaf plum trees were planted.
"Some people would have looked at this and seen a desolate piece of
property. We saw a piece of property with potential."</LD>
<LD>   Until Wednesday, the median that fronts houses along Sepulveda
Boulevard from Haynes to Lemay streets was a dirt strip that
occasionally attracted discarded furniture. Neighbors in the nearby
Midvale Estates tract were in the midst of applying for a city grant
to plant trees in the median when they discovered the city was
already planning to do it.</LD>
<TE>   "I got a call from my partner, who said, 'You're not going to
believe this,'" said real estate saleswoman Cathy Cressy, who lives
two blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of applying for money to plant trees, Cressy said, the
residents will ask for funds to plant ground cover.</TE>
<TE>   The tree planting is part of the Department of Water and Power's
$8-million Trees for a Green L.A. program, which calls for planting
200,000 shade trees throughout the city during the next two years,
most of them on residential property. The Sepulveda greenway will be
planted by members of the Los Angeles Conservation Corps.</TE>
<TE>   Several observers at Hahn's news conference said the tree planting
is a goodwill gesture by city officials who want Los Angeles to stay
united.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to see [the Valley] secede," said Robert
Bonfiglio, a facilities operations manager at a local studio.</TE>
<TE>   Residents interested in signing up for planting workshops can call
(800) 473-3652.</TE>

<HD>Assembly Seeks HMO Review Panel</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Legislators defer efforts to require added
coverage pending an analysis of costs and benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rising medical costs are stymieing California legislators' attempts
to require HMO coverage for such benefits as infertility treatments,
bone density screenings and hearing aids.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly leaders agreed this week to temporarily shelve such
proposed mandates on health plans and instead support the creation of
a commission to weigh costs and medical benefits of each possible new
coverage requirement.</LD>
<LD>   "We need a better process of evaluation than we have right now,"
said Helen Thomson (D-Davis), chairwoman of the Assembly Health
Committee. Commissions to evaluate similar health mandates are used
in 11 states, she added.</LD>
<TE>   HMO industry leaders say that if the 18 bills for various
treatments pass, California employers and consumers would have to pay
an increase of more than $3 billion for coverage. Such added costs
would further exacerbate a crisis of affordability in private and
public health insurance, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Even without any expanded benefits, the California Public
Employees' Retirement System agreed this month to pay insurers a 25%
increase in premiums next year. Some of that increase will be passed
on to the 1.2 million state and local government workers and their
families, as well as retirees.</TE>
<TE>   Private employers also expect to face double-digit rate increases,
although not to the same extent as the pension fund.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear there has to be some balance," Thomson said. "We
simply can't afford to cover every possible service. On the other
hand, the industry has frequently cried wolf. This commission will
help find the truth and help us set our priorities."</TE>
<TE>   The bills in Sacramento would, among other things, require
coverage for bone marrow donor testing, ovarian cancer screening,
wigs for cancer patients and enhanced substance abuse treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the proposed mandates would increase costs for the state,
which pays for public insurance programs. Facing a budget deficit of
$17.5 billion or more, the state can ill afford any additional
expenses, said Assemblyman Robert Pacheco (R-Walnut), who also
supports a commission.</TE>
<TE>   Health plan representatives say they are not trying to prevent
patients from receiving care or to stonewall all the bills. Last
year, they supported a law requiring coverage for patients
participating in cancer clinical trials.</TE>
<TE>   That said, many previous mandates "have been passed without any
understanding of what they cost," said Walter Zelman, president of
the industry's California Assn. of Health Plans.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Insurance Committee has used a task force led by the
California HealthCare Foundation to evaluate mandates. In 1999, the
working group studied the cost of requiring extra coverage for mental
health, diabetes education, hospice care and contraception. All those
became law. Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) has said she wants to
use a similar structure to evaluate pending bills.</TE>
<TE>   If a commission is established, it must give ample consideration
to the medical benefit of proposed treatments, not just their costs,
consumer advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, people need to get the care that they
need," said Anthony Wright, director of organizing for Health Access.
"We need a real process to actually look at these treatments and say
in certain instances, 'Maybe this is medically necessary.'"</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Patricia Wiggins (D-Santa Rosa) said she has mixed
feelings about the delay for her bill, which would mandate coverage
of hearing aids. As a hearing-impaired person, she says, she knows
the value of hearing aids and the benefits they provide.</TE>
<TE>   "My big concern is the opportunity to get relevant information to
those that will be making these evaluations," Wiggins said.</TE>

<HD>Holden May Admit Rule Violations</HD>
<DH>Politics: The L.A. councilman considers stipulating to
breaking city limits on campaign financing, for the second time. He
could face fines of $155,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Councilman Nate Holden said Thursday that he might admit
having violated city campaign finance rules on more than two dozen
occasions, but asked for another day to consider his next step.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got to think about so much. It's ironclad if we stipulate,"
he said after a city Ethics Commission hearing on the matter
Thursday. "I've decided to sleep on it."</LD>
<LD>   Holden and his campaign treasurer, Anne Froehlich, are charged
with having committed 31 violations during the 1999 campaign that
could result in up to $155,000 in fines. A commission audit concluded
that Holden accepted 11 donations exceeding the $500 contribution
limit for City Council races, and requested public matching funds
twice for 20 contributions. Each violation could result in a fine of
up to $5,000.</LD>
<TE>   Near the end of the six-hour hearing, Holden and Froehlich
appeared to be on the verge of conceding the violations as long as
they received ample opportunity to describe mitigating circumstances
during the penalty phase of the proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   In many instances, Holden and Froehlich said they found the
violations themselves and voluntarily returned money that exceeded
the contribution limit.</TE>
<TE>   "There may have been some mistakes on my part, but ... we
certainly worked very hard to identify people who gave us money and
return all of it that we found we shouldn't have accepted," Froehlich
said.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Miriam Krinsky had started reciting each
violation individually, to receive confirmation of each stipulation,
when Assistant City Atty. Anthony S. Alperin reminded Holden and
Froehlich that stipulating meant they would be admitting breaking the
law. It was at that point that they decided to consider the matter
further.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Holden lashed out at the commission's staff,
saying he was unfairly being singled out and discriminated against.
Holden was fined $27,500 two years ago for similar infractions during
his 1995 campaign--violations he stipulated to because he said
otherwise they would have been publicized five days before the
election.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been political at all times," he said. "Who's responsible
for it, I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Commission Executive Director LeeAnn M. Pelham declined to comment
on the allegations, saying only: "I think the commission's case will
speak for itself."</TE>
<TE>   The hearing is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. today at Los Angeles
City Hall.</TE>

<HD>John Mabee, 80; Empire Was Built on Markets and Horses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Mabee, who parlayed a $2,000 investment in a mom-and-pop grocery
store into a financial empire that included a supermarket chain, an
insurance company and one of thoroughbred racing's most successful
breeding and racing farms, has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Mabee, who suffered two strokes in the last two years, the most
recent less than two weeks ago at his Golden Eagle Farm in Ramona,
Calif., died Wednesday night at a care facility in Del Mar, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   A hard-nosed businessman, Mabee made headlines in 1997 when he
battled with Chuck Quackenbush, California's state insurance
commissioner, and received $20 million when his Golden Eagle
Insurance Co. was first taken over by the state and then sold.</LD>
<TE>   At the time, Golden Eagle was the third-largest provider of
workers' compensation coverage in California and was thought by the
state to be on shaky financial ground because of inadequate cash
reserves. But Mabee said that Quackenbush's investigation of Golden
Eagle was politically motivated.</TE>
<TE>   The supermarkets and the insurance premiums might have paid the
bills, but it was the breeding, selling and racing of his horses that
stimulated Mabee the most.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch John Mabee during a race," the bloodstock agent Rollin
Baugh once said. "You'll see the enthusiasm of an 18-year-old kid
from a person who is basically cool and reserved."</TE>
<TE>   Mabee bought his first two horses for $6,000 at a Del Mar yearling
auction in 1957. He had visited the Del Mar track--where he would
later become president, board chairman and overseer of an $80-million
rebuilding program in the 1990s--four or five times a year and,
remembering his affection for horses while growing up on a small
family farm near Des Moines, decided to dabble in the racing
business.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea when I bought those two yearlings," he said many
years later, "that I would end up as the leading breeder in the
country."</TE>
<TE>   At his death, Mabee's horse operation, based at his 568-acre
spread in Ramona and buttressed by his wife's active participation,
was still going full-bore. About 400 horses, including seven
stallions, are stabled at the Ramona farm, and about 170 broodmares
are spread between the California property and three farms in
Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   "No one man has had more involvement in racing in California, or
has done more for Del Mar in particular than John," said Joe Harper,
president of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club.</TE>
<TE>   Golden Eagle Farm gave California horse breeding a national
presence in a business traditionally dominated by Kentucky horsemen.
Mabee bought shares in top Kentucky stallions, breeding his mares to
the likes of Nijinsky II, Secretariat, Mr. Prospector and Seattle
Slew. Golden Eagle-bred horses won 206 races last year and earned $5
million, which ranked seventh nationally. Mabee's own runners won 60
races and earned $2.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Mabee led all North American breeders with purses of $7
million, and he also won the owners' title with earnings of $5.4
million. He won Eclipse awards, racing's highest honors, for breeding
in 1991, '97 and '98. In 1998, horses he bred earned a leading $8.2
million.</TE>
<TE>   "People think it's a sport," Mabee once said, "but if you're going
to breed and race, it's like becoming a doctor. It takes 12 years to
become a doctor, and it took 12 years or more to learn the horse
business."</TE>
<TE>   Mabee's best horse, Best Pal, won three $1-million races and
earned $5.6 million, the second-highest total for a California-bred.
But Best Pal, not regally bred, was given little chance before he
raced. It was estimated that he would have brought no more than
$10,000 at auction, so Mabee kept him and had him castrated, which
meant that he could not earn high stud fees.</TE>
<TE>   Racing from 1990 to 1996, Best Pal won 18 of 47 starts, including
some of the premier races in California--the Hollywood Gold Cup, the
Santa Anita Handicap and the 1991 Pacific Classic at Del Mar, a
$1-million race that Mabee had just installed at his own track. Best
Pal finished second to Strike the Gold in the 1991 Kentucky Derby and
ran fifth in the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   John and Betty Mabee grew up six miles apart on opposite sides of
the Iowa-Missouri state line, but they didn't meet until high school
and married two years after graduation. Mabee became an apprentice
carpenter and later was a construction foreman in Henderson, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, when their son Larry--their only child--was 3 months old,
they piled into the family car and moved to San Diego. Mabee first
worked as a carpenter knocking out casting forms for ocean-towed
concrete barges.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he bought a mom-and-pop grocery store for $2,000. By the
1950s, he had launched the Big Bear chain, which grew to about 30
stores. He sold it in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, he bought the Golden Eagle insurance license for $2.8
million. The company's premiums reached $700 million by the
mid-1990s, but the California Department of Insurance, concerned that
$69 million in unsecured loans was owed to Mabee, seized Golden Eagle
in January 1997 and began seeking buyers.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Mabee pressed on with his horse interests.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a pleasant memory of every week in the horse business," he
said. "We have horses running almost every day, and we have horses
that win almost every week. I get enjoyment out of all the wins, even
the victories that come from horses I've sold. Day in and day out,
you can't beat it."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son and his wife of 60 years, Mabee is survived
by three grandchildren. The family asks that, in lieu of flowers,
contributions be made to the Aseltine School for the learning
disabled in San Diego.</TE>

<HD>MTA OKs $5 Million for Disabled</HD>
<DH>Transit: Increase in spending keeps pace with inflation,
but won't prevent cuts in service. Riders protest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board voted Thursday to
increase spending on services for the disabled by $5 million, enough
to keep up with inflation but insufficient to ward off a scheduled
cut in services starting in August.</LD>
<LD>   Some directors of the agency said they will continue to look for
ways to maintain some of the paratransit services, including same-day
rides at a reduced cost.</LD>
<LD>   The spending decision came on the same day that the MTA board gave
its unanimous support to decentralizing the sprawling local bus
system into five smaller service sectors, each with its own governing
council. Still to be ironed out is how much power the MTA board will
delegate to each of the regions.</LD>
<TE>   MTA Director Zev Yaroslavsky, a county supervisor and chairman of
a Valley group exploring a breakaway from the MTA, warned that board
members will "have a war on our hands" if they dally too long in
establishing regional control.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA leaders face another emotionally charged issue as they
continue to ponder how much service to provide for the disabled, and
how to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, patrons of the county's largest paratransit provider,
Access Services Inc., can call a dispatcher 24 hours a day and get
picked up for a ride in a special van or car in as little as 45
minutes. The cost, depending on distance traveled, is $1.50 to $4.</TE>
<TE>   But confronted with a 30% surge in ridership, the board of Access
Services voted two months ago to cut services starting in August,
because it feared it would not meet its $63.8-million budget. More
than 90% of that money comes from the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed cuts include requiring riders to schedule pickups a
day in advance. If riders want same-day pickup, they would have to
pay much higher fares or use a taxi subsidized for up to $13.50.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of advocates for the disabled and paratransit users--many
arriving from all corners of the county in their wheelchairs--spoke
out passionately before the MTA board Thursday to ask for $10 million
in additional funding to maintain the current level of services.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue is huge for those of us who use paratransit," said
Yael Hagen, of Chatsworth. "Without the ability to have flexibility
in this service ... we stand to lose our ability not just to get to
places but to live life, to deal with unexpected things."</TE>
<TE>   Some speakers said they live on fixed incomes and cannot afford
the higher fares. Others have protested that taxi cabs have been
known to reject riders with wheelchairs or guide dogs.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, another speaker told board members that the high cost
of accommodating disabled riders is hurting service for others.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned that this authority is paying too much [for
paratransit] and too little for its [other] constituents," said
Kymberleigh Richards, a spokeswoman for Southern California Transit
Advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA currently provides $1.65 or less in subsidies for every
bus or rail ride, but $25.68 per paratransit ride, according to the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   The scheduled cuts would still leave the transit giant in
compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act, which only
requires next-day services, MTA staff members said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this allows them to provide ADA service, plus a little
bit extra," said MTA Chief Executive Roger Snoble. "We think it is a
good deal from our part."</TE>
<TE>   But advocates for the disabled say the cost of service should not
be an issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't disable the disabled," said Charlotte Brodie of Mission
Hills, whose daughter relies on paratransit. "Now that the disabled
have found their independence and freedom, don't take it away from
them."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, an MTA board member,
asked the agency to look into the possibility of allocating "some
funds to provide some services" above and beyond those authorized
Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in N. Hollywood Death Arrested in Mexico</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man whom police sought for 16 years in connection with a North
Hollywood slaying has been captured in Mexico and will be tried there
for the crime, Los Angeles detectives said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Merced de los Santos, 56, was charged with murder in 1986 after
witnesses identified him as the man who shot an acquaintance,
26-year-old Francisco Esparza, during an argument in a parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   Police Det. Vince Bancroft said authorities pursued De los Santos
for years without success. Then in February 2001, a North Hollywood
resident saw the case profiled on the television show "L.A.'s Most
Wanted" and gave police an address in Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   The following month, the Los Angeles Police Department's foreign
prosecutions unit went to Mexico City and filed the case with the
Mexican court, which issued an arrest warrant. Authorities
''continued checking various locations where he had been seen by
witnesses, and eventually he showed up,'' Bancroft said.</TE>
<TE>   De los Santos was arraigned on the murder charge Feb. 7 in federal
court in the Mexican state of Nayarit, U.S. authorities said. He is
to be tried in Mexico because he is a Mexican citizen, police said.</TE>

<HD>Soccer Mom's Daughter Calls Inventor Bell the Object of Her

<LD>"Who is your hero and why?" the Daily Pilot asked some grade school
kids in Costa Mesa. Alina Carnahan, 8-year-old pragmatist, replied:
"Alexander Graham Bell, because he invented the telephone so after
soccer practice you can call your mom and it doesn't take a long
time."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of great names: On a trip to New Zealand, Sue Crose of
Redondo Beach snapped a shot of a roadway sign that included two
names that have been paired in this country too (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   And listen, you Republicans out there, I don't want to hear any
comparisons to the New Zealand sign that appeared here earlier in the
week--the one for Puke Puke Road.</LD>
<TE>   Spacey stuff: Fashion items at the Space and Aviation Memorabilia
auction this weekend at the Santa Monica Museum of Flying (see
accompanying) include:</TE>
<TE>   * A Soyuz 3 cosmonaut's white leather helmet with "white mesh top
... complete with earphones, two microphones and a cable" (bidding
price: $1,500-$2,000).</TE>
<TE>   * And for $500 to $750, you can grab an astronaut's "1970s partial
pressure suit pants used to limit blood flow to the lower
extremities" during some maneuvers. (I get the same effect when I try
to put on my old size 34 Levis.)</TE>
<TE>   Hot air: Some unusual quotes from local news programs collected
this year on the media Web site www.ronfineman.com:</TE>
<TE>   * Colleen Williams of KNBC-TV Channel 4, in a piece on a popular
rental car, said it was "renting like hotcakes." (Fineman, a radio
newsman, commented that he didn't know anyone who rented hotcakes.)</TE>
<TE>   * Harold Greene of KCBS-TV Channel 2, in a bit of shameless
plugging, said: "If you watch the CBS crime show 'CSI,' you know how
important a good crime lab is to police work."</TE>
<TE>   * Mario Solis of KNBC, in a promo for his sportscast, proclaimed
that it had been a good day for auto racing, adding: "If you like
crashes, it was even better."</TE>
<TE>   * Mia Lee of KCAL-TV Channel 9 said on Presidents Day, Feb. 18:
"The nation's first president would have celebrated a birthday
today." Actually, George would have celebrated it on Feb. 22, his
real birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Famous draft dodgers: The recent pro football draft will make
millionaires of some college stars. But the event nevertheless lacked
the star power of the 1974 World Team Tennis draft. To garner some
publicity, the Boston Lobsters drafted Elton John in the 10th round,
the Hawaii Leis took Bill Cosby in the 13th round, and the L.A.
Strings selected Johnny Carson in the 14th round. (None signed, by
the way.)</TE>
<TE>   Before sports became such big, serious business, some other
leagues had drafts with light moments too.</TE>
<TE>   When Larry Brown became New York Nets coach, he selected Vic Sison
in the 10th round. Sison was an equipment manager at UCLA. Then there
was the time Minnesota Vikings Coach Norm Van Brocklin couldn't
remember whom he was drafting in the 20th round. He blurted out "John
Wayne." Asked what college Wayne attended, Van Brocklin responded:
"Fort Apache State."</TE>
<TE>   Stupid criminal tricks: The Beach Reporter said a woman screamed
when her purse was stolen in Redondo Beach. Witnesses chased the
thief and found him hiding in an appropriate place: a trash can.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: In the classifieds of a San Diego County newspaper,
Steve Wiener spotted an item that mentioned a Jack Russell "terror."
Must be murder on the carpet.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bishop Thomas J. Grady, 87, who oversaw the completion of the
National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., in
1959, died of a kidney ailment Sunday at his home in Altamonte
Springs, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Grady served as director of the shrine, the largest Catholic
church in the Americas, from 1956 to 1967.</LD>
<LD>   The building of the mammoth Romanesque and Byzantine-style shrine
began in the 1920s with a massive underground Crypt Church, but
construction had been on a two-decade hiatus when then-Msgr. Grady
took over as director.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Chicago, Grady was ordained in 1938 and received a
master's degree in English from Loyola University in Chicago. He
taught at a Chicago prep school and served as a senior administrator
at the Mundelein seminary before becoming director of the shrine.</TE>
<TE>   He left that post after being elevated to auxiliary bishop in
1967. He served in the Chicago Archdiocese until 1973, when he was
named the second bishop of Orlando, Fla. He retired in 1990.</TE>

<HD>Richard McKelvey, 57; Caltech Professor Tested Vote
Theories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard D. McKelvey, 57, a professor at the California Institute of
Technology best-known for his role in developing mathematical
theories of voting, died of cancer Monday at his Altadena home.</LD>
<LD>   He pioneered the use of laboratory experiments to test theories of
voting and other group behavior. Working with his Caltech colleagues,
McKelvey explored the effect of various voting rules on the accuracy
of jury verdicts, the effect of polls on election outcomes, and
impasses in negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   He discovered that the majority-rule voting system does not
necessarily lead to compromise or "middle-of-the-road" decisions,
contrary to conventional wisdom, but can produce more extreme
results. This was one of his major contributions, colleagues said.</LD>
<TE>   McKelvey also initiated a Turing contest, named after famed
computer scientist Alan Turing, that will award a prize to the
theorist who best predicts how people behave in strategic situations.
The contest, which will include leading scholars in economics and
game theory, will be held this summer.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Oberlin College in Ohio, McKelvey earned a master's
degree in mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis in
1967, and a master's and doctorate in political science from New
York's University of Rochester in 1970 and 1971. In 1979, he joined
the faculty at Caltech, where he was the Edie and Lew Wasserman
Professor of Political Science and director of the William D. Hacker
Social Science Experimental Laboratory.</TE>

<LD>David Wood, 77, a former soloist and rehearsal director for the
Martha Graham Dance Company who founded the dance program at UC

muscular dystrophy.</LD>
<LD>   Wood danced with Alwin Nikolais, Jose Limon and Doris Humphrey,

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Goodfader, 62, a Venice restaurateur, businessman and community
activist who was involved in the refurbishment of the beach
boardwalk, died of lung cancer April 19 at his home in Venice.</LD>
<LD>   Goodfader, who moved to Venice in 1975, owned the Sidewalk Cafe
and an open-air vending area. Both businesses are on the boardwalk,
as is Small World Books, which is run by his wife, Mary. He also
owned the Break Shot, a sports bar in West Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   As a community activist, Goodfader fought for cleaner restrooms,
more lighting, and other health and safety issues on the Venice
boardwalk.</LD>
<TE>   A native of Winthrop, Mass., Goodfader earned a bachelor's degree
in electrical engineering from Worchester Polytechnic Institute in
1960. After serving in the Army, he worked as an engineer for
Sylvania and was involved in designing special lighting on projects
such as the Apollo space capsule.</TE>
<TE>   He came to Los Angeles as Sylvania's West Coast sales manager, but
soon became an entrepreneur. His previous businesses included the One
Life natural food store in Santa Monica, the Green Bean restaurant in
Culver City and the Sidewalk Cantina in Venice.</TE>

<HD>Paul R. Porter, 94; Economist, Consultant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul R. Porter, a self-taught economist whose varied career included
being the editor of a socialist magazine, a ranking Marshall Plan
administrator and an advocate for the renewal of inner cities racked
by rioting and social ills, has died. He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Also known internationally as a business consultant, Porter died
Sunday at a hospital in Sarasota, Fla., after a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Porter had been a labor organizer and magazine editor in Wisconsin
when he severed his socialist ties in the spring of 1941. He resigned
publicly from the Socialist Party's national executive committee to
protest the party's opposition to U.S. Lend Lease legislation to help
Britain during World War II.</LD>
<TE>   He went on to hold a series of key government jobs during the
1940s and early '50s. As chairman of the War Production Board's ship
stabilization committee, he helped establish labor standards in
shipbuilding.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1940s, he became a U.S. member of the European Coal
Organization and was U.S. alternate to W. Averell Harriman as
representative to the Economic Commission for Europe. He also was a
top deputy of the U.S. team that helped devise NATO.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1940s, he was chief of the U.S. Mission for Economic
Affairs in London and then joined the Economic Cooperation
Administration as head of its mission to Greece in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   After trying to create reforms in Greek labor and economic
policies, he was promoted to assistant ECA administrator and was a
close advisor to Marshall Plan steward William H. Draper Jr.</TE>
<TE>   He rose to deputy for economic affairs for Europe at the Mutual
Security Agency, a successor to the ECA. He resigned from that
position in 1953, amid congressional hearings into his old socialist
ties.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to start Porter International Co., which in the 1950s
and '60s fostered overseas production of U.S. goods through licensing
agreements between firms in the United States and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   He sold the business in 1967 and spent the next several years
researching and writing "The Recovery of American Cities," a
controversial book published in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   In hearings before Congress and also as an urban affairs professor
at Cleveland State University, he spoke about his blueprint for
weaning cities off federal dependency and reshaping inner cities
losing their tax base as wealth flowed into the suburbs. He compared
his ideas to a Marshall Plan for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He argued for a government-supported jobs program and
public-private partnerships. He also wrote that the inner-city poor
should follow blue-collar jobs into the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   A few city neighborhoods should be razed entirely and rebuilt with
high-income housing to stabilize the tax base, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At one hearing before the House Committee on Banking, Currency and
Housing, Porter was asked whether the movement of blacks to the
suburbs would dilute their political power.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it might, but I don't know of any way we can tell people
that they ought to stay in a city where they are unable to find jobs,
merely in order to support a candidate for office on the basis of
race," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have to find a more constructive solution than that."</TE>
<TE>   Porter was born on a farm in Drexel, Mo., and grew up in Kansas
City, Mo. He was a journalism graduate of the University of Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Socialist Party in his early 20s and wrote for such
publications as Revolt while a labor organizer.</TE>
<TE>   He was president of the Philadelphia taxi drivers union until
tuberculosis sidelined him for a year. After recuperating, he was
editor of the Kenosha Labor newspaper in Wisconsin from 1935 to '41.</TE>
<TE>   His socialist past was investigated twice during his years in
government, first in the early 1940s by Rep. Martin Dies Jr.
(D-Texas), chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate
Un-American Activities. No actions were taken against Porter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, Sen. Homer S. Ferguson (R-Mich.), a member of the Senate
subcommittee on foreign aid appropriations, said Porter needed
vetting because he was in a position to disseminate aid money
intended to stem Communist influence in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Powerful industrialists such as Henry J. Kaiser spoke out on Mr.
Porter's behalf, but Ferguson demanded his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The hearings brought up Porter's former marriage to Eleanor
Nelson, who as Eleanor Nelson Soyring was active in Communist-tinged
labor circles. They had long been divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than risk harming the aid program, Porter resigned. He
viewed the rest of his work in the private sector as a means of
carrying on the work he could not complete in government.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include four children from his second marriage and seven
grandchildren.</TE>

Vegas slot machine, cursing, muttering, even yelling in frustration
as they punch the keys.</LD>
<LD>   They are engineers and conductors for Burlington Northern Santa Fe
railroad who are checking their work schedules.</LD>
<LD>   "Look at this!" one conductor from Los Angeles exclaimed, seeing
that there was only one conductor ahead of him before he would be
sent back out on the rails. It was after 2 a.m. Wednesday, and he was
still tired from his previous run.</LD>
<TE>   The Motel 8 is a terminal motel, with a bank of rooms contracted
out to the railroad for its workers' use.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the railway company said it maintains high
safety standards. "I have never worked for a safer company," Lena
Kent said. "They are a leader in industry safety."</TE>
<TE>   But the railroad men--and they were all men at the motel Wednesday
morning--said irregular shifts, along with work rules that can
unexpectedly land them far from home, make for a sometimes
frustrating and exhausting job--though one that is well paid and
exhilarating. And as they talked about the job's challenges, their
thoughts turned again and again to the freight train that collided
head-on with a Metrolink passenger train Tuesday in Placentia,
killing two and injuring more than 160.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary indications are that human error caused the crash,
with engineer Darrell Wells running through two warning lights. He
and conductor Dean E. Tacoronte were injured. Fatigue is being
examined as one possible cause.</TE>
<TE>   More than two dozen of the men's fellow workers here said that
although they had no idea what had happened, fatigue was a likely
possibility, even though the two men had not been scheduled for any
extraordinary hours shortly before the crash. All the train workers
said that sleep deprivation and grueling schedules were the most
serious safety issue on the freight trains, and that perhaps this
week's tragedy would bring about change.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the workers said scheduling changes could go a lot
further toward preventing fatal crashes. They'd like regular
schedules, and to know in advance when they'll be off.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules are written in blood here," one engineer said. "The
only time they change is when people are injured or die."</TE>
<TE>   Logs of Wells' and Tacoronte's schedules obtained by The Times
show that Wells had been off for 22 hours, after working in the Los
Angeles train yard from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. His wife lives in Needles,
friends said, but he often stays with his mother in the San Fernando
Valley. Tacoronte had been off for about 10 hours, after working from
9:15 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. the day before the crash, and 4 p.m. to
midnight the day before that.</TE>
<TE>   Shifts that vary from daytime to nighttime work have frequently
been cited by safety experts as a potential factor in causing
accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Because of commuting time and other factors, colleagues said
Tacoronte would have had a maximum of six hours of uninterrupted
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Both men reported for duty at 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, according to the
logs, scheduled to make a "long run" to Barstow 149 miles away.
Instead, nearly six hours later, they had only reached Placentia. It
was not clear at what time the train pulled out of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I wonder the most is why did it take five hours to go
35 miles? I don't know Darrell and Dean's situation that night, but I
imagine they were definitely tired," said a fellow conductor.</TE>
<TE>   Both men probably knew that because of the delays, they risked
being "dead headed" on the tracks, forced to stop the train after 12
hours rather than reach their destination, and wait for a van to pick
them up and shuttle them to the nearest terminal motel, like the one
in Barstow.</TE>
<TE>   Because of past concerns about fatigue-related crashes, Federal
Railroad Administration law limits train-operator work shifts to 12
hours. Workers say that they agree with the law but that being
marooned repeatedly in a company motel far from home with no pay is
not their idea of time off.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked 11 hours and 10 minutes," said Danny Lobb, 26, of
Bakersfield, sprawled on a sofa late Wednesday afternoon. Lobb and an
engineer had worked through the night bringing freight from
Bakersfield to Barstow, arriving shortly after 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Eight hours later, he was waiting for a call to go back to work,
never having been home. He has missed more of his 8-year-old
daughter's birthdays than he has attended, and he and his wife
regularly reschedule their anniversary celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "Doing this job, you don't have a life," said Shane Adams, 38, a
conductor out of Bakersfield. "Your significant other is the guy in
the engine with you."</TE>
<TE>   But Adams, who is a second-generation railroad man, said he loves
the job when he is out on the rails.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you get out of the yard, it's great," he said. "You're out
in the open."</TE>
<TE>   He and others said the pay is good--$80,000 to $100,000 a year
depending on how many weeks in a row one is willing to work.</TE>
<TE>   And many of the men still carry the romance of the trains in their
blood. They wear traditional trainman's overalls and relish the lingo
and legends of the profession.</TE>
<TE>   But as much as they love the work, most of the men said that in an
age of mega mergers and cut corners, it has become harder to be well
rested and do their jobs right.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many, many times when I should be in my pajamas in bed,
and I'm out there working," one conductor said.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokeswoman Kent said that was also untrue.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a policy that if anyone is too fatigued, they can request
time off, and it will be granted automatically," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There are rules aplenty related to safety. No wedding rings can be
worn--so a finger can't be ripped off while a worker is climbing
around heavy equipment. Sunglasses are mandatory, to block out
blinding glare. And in every engine there is a chirping "alerter"
machine that must be reset by the conductor or engineer every 30
seconds, either by pushing a button or moving other equipment in the
car, such as the throttle.</TE>
<TE>   If neither one resets it, it reaches an earsplitting pitch
designed to wake even the heaviest of sleepers.</TE>
<TE>   Kent said workers know before they choose to take the jobs it is a
"24-hour industry." She added: "If we shut down in the middle of the
night, we shut down transportation of goods literally across the
country."</TE>
<TE>   The men understand that, but say having regularly scheduled days
off, for instance, would make a big difference.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now they own us 24 hours a day, seven days a week," said
one engineer, as he climbed back in the company van shortly before
midnight, to head out on another long haul across the desert.</TE>

<HD>Coronary Care Unit to Open at Los Robles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Robles Regional Medical Center is opening a $3.4-million coronary
care unit designed to reduce the need to divert patients to other
hospitals because critical care beds are full.</LD>
<LD>   The new unit, part of a $130-million expansion and renovation
project launched four years ago at the Thousand Oaks hospital, will
add 10 beds for heart patients who require urgent care.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, hospital officials say, too many patients--nearly two
dozen a month on average last year--have been turned away because the
medical center's intensive care unit has been full.</LD>
<TE>   "This means we are going to be more available for the patients in
our community," said critical care manager Jenny Rech, who provided a
community tour Thursday of the new facility, which is equipped with
private rooms, skylights and state-of-the-art beds.</TE>
<TE>   "No one likes to be on diversion, but unfortunately all of the
hospitals in Ventura County have been plagued by overcrowding," Rech
said. "This is a real milestone. Hopefully, this will help eliminate
the problem, at least for our immediate area."</TE>
<TE>   Every hospital in Ventura County has been forced to divert
patients at least a couple of days this year, according to the
Ventura County Emergency Medical Services Department.</TE>
<TE>   Los Robles is often among the hardest hit.</TE>
<TE>   In January, for instance, the medical center was closed to
intensive care patients for at least a portion of 29 days. That was
more than any hospital in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the medical center was on diversion an average 19 days
each month, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Frank Schillo knows the situation at Los
Robles firsthand.</TE>
<TE>   Suffering in March 2001 from a heart condition caused by blocked
arteries, the 68-year-old Thousand Oaks resident had to be sent to
St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard--20 miles from his
home--for triple-bypass surgery.</TE>
<TE>   While he had a good experience at St. John's, Schillo said he
would have preferred being closer to home to make it easier for his
family to visit.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of a surprise when I got in the ambulance and they
told me I couldn't go to Los Robles," said Schillo, now fully
recuperated. "Fortunately for me, the time factor did not make a big
difference. But in a situation where minutes can make a difference,
[having more beds] can really be important."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital has already completed a $6.5-million,
12,000-square-foot emergency room with private rooms. And plans call
for a 200,000-square-foot patient wing and 520-space parking
structure, with a cost for both projects put at $120 million.</TE>
<TE>   Los Robles spokeswoman Kris Carraway-Bowman said hospital
officials are especially pleased with the new coronary care unit
because it addresses a pressing need in the fast-growing region.</TE>
<TE>   The new facility will open Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Carraway-Bowman said officials expect the addition of 10 beds to
the existing 20-bed ICU will cut the hospital's diversion rate by at
least half.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the business of helping people and it's frustrating
when you can't," she said. "We just decided that no longer was
acceptable."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A leader of the Red Cross chapter here resigned Thursday following an
independent review panel's recommendation that he and two others be
removed.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Duddles said he was leaving his post as chairman of the
chapter's board of directors immediately for personal reasons.</LD>
<LD>   Duddles' resignation came after a review panel said he, chapter
CEO Dodie Rotherham and Vice Chairman Rod Lanthorne should be ousted
because they had lost "effectiveness and standing in the community."</LD>
<TE>   The review by the 14-member panel followed criticism of the
chapter's handling of financial aid intended for victims of the 2001
wildfire in Alpine, east of San Diego. Victims, local officials and
members of the chapter's board complained that organization leaders
blocked efforts to disclose how such donations were spent and
thwarted reform efforts.</TE>

<HD>Van-Leasing Program Targets Farm Workers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kings County has launched the nation's first van-pool program for
farm workers. Officials showed off new white vans Wednesday that farm
workers can lease to drive co-workers to the fields or packinghouses.
The vans meet new safety regulations required for vehicles that
transport farm workers.</LD>
<LD>   Commuting safety has been a major concern in recent years after a
series of deadly crashes, including one near Five Points in 1999 that
killed 13 tomato pickers</LD>
<LD>   Using $3 million of state and federal money, 48 vans and four
buses have been purchased. The program initially will provide
transportation in Kings, Tulare and Kern counties but spread to
Fresno this summer after funding increases to $5million. It is
expected to provide transportation to 100,000 workers.</LD>

<HD>Alarcon Aims to Secure Rates for Valley City</HD>
<DH>Legislation: State senator seeks to stop the DWP from
charging more to local customers if the region secedes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state lawmaker who hopes to become mayor of the proposed San
Fernando Valley city moved Thursday to protect Valley ratepayers from
what he said would be unfair water and power prices in the event the
region secedes from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   State Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) said he was incensed at the
possibility that Los Angeles might try to charge higher utility rates
in areas that leave the city. He introduced legislation Thursday to
prohibit cities from doing just that.</LD>
<LD>   ''This is just an issue of fairness,'' Alarcon said. ''Whatever
happens with secession, the people in the Valley have basically
helped build the Department of Water and Power, and they should not
be charged higher rates.''</LD>
<TE>   The issue has significant political implications for both sides of
the secession debate. Opponents of breaking apart the city could
raise the specter of higher electricity and water bills to dampen
enthusiasm for secession, while supporters insist that the Valley
taxpayers deserve protections from unfair rate increases.</TE>
<TE>   The measure comes a day after city officials resisted a breakup
plan proposed by the Local Agency Formation Commission that would bar
L.A. from charging different DWP rates in breakaway areas.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon, who said earlier this month that he intends to run for
Valley mayor if LAFCO places secession on the November ballot,
amended his earlier bill asking the University of California to study
alternatives to secession.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction from city officials was swift--and not altogether
serious.</TE>
<TE>   ''I've never heard of Sacramento changing something that fast,''
said Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, a LAFCO board member, noting
that the panel has just three weeks to decide whether to put
secession to a citywide vote. ''I think we all need to take some time
and come back and look at this with cooler heads.''</TE>
<TE>   Ron Deaton, the city's chief legislative analyst, said he thought
the power to run municipal utilities and set rates was embedded in
the state Constitution--and therefore immune to Alarcon's challenge.</TE>
<TE>   While politically clear cut, the water and power issue is legally
murky. LAFCO has received conflicting legal opinions, with the county
counsel saying the agency does not have the power to split the DWP
system between Los Angeles and the Valley, and the state legislative
counsel disagreeing.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists, meanwhile, began gearing up their campaigns.
Leaders of the Valley and Hollywood secession groups announced
Thursday that they have hired the political consulting firm of
Goddard Claussen Porter Novelli.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has run dozens of successful ballot measure campaigns in
California, including the 2000 campaign for Proposition 39, which
allows school bonds to be adopted with 55% of the vote instead of a
two-thirds majority.</TE>
<TE>   ''They know how to help their clients communicate on contentious
issues in ways that resonate with voters,'' said Jeff Brain, the
president of secession group Valley VOTE.</TE>

<HD>Tighter School Security Urged</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: Among its findings, the grand jury says
fences would help.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Ventura County high schools need more security, including perimeter
fences, surveillance cameras and police officers to further reduce
the chances of a Columbine-type incident, according to a grand jury
report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the panel's lengthy and pointed recommendations, several
school officials said that turning campuses into prison-like
environments would not stop a gunman and sends the wrong message to
the community.</LD>
<LD>   "What's right for one school may not be right for another school.
This needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis," said Don Austin,
general counsel for the Ventura Unified School District, one of three
districts criticized in the report. "Perimeter fencing does not
guarantee the safety of kids," Austin said.</LD>
<TE>   In the wake of Columbine, as well as a shooting that left two dead
at Santana High School in San Diego County and a deadly police
shooting last year at an Oxnard school, grand jurors visited 20 area
high schools to investigate security measures.</TE>
<TE>   While the panel lauded schools for having safety manuals and
emergency plans, the grand jury found four schools had no established
programs to check for weapons. They were identified as Ventura, Buena
(Ventura Unified), Oak Park and Nordhoff (Ojai Unified) high schools.</TE>
<TE>   The report also states that five campuses are far too accessible
to nonstudents.</TE>
<TE>   "Members of the grand jury were able to walk onto the school
grounds of Nordhoff, Buena and Ventura high schools during school
hours with no detection. A staff person at Ventura High School
eventually challenged us," the report stated.</TE>
<TE>   Although not identified in the report, the other two high schools
could include campuses in Santa Paula and Fillmore, which have
partial fencing such as at the other three schools, said Charles
Weis, county superintendent of schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Every school has different safety needs and when you start to say
that all of them have to have this or have to have that, you lose
some of the context of the pressing safety issues," Weis said.
"Fences are good but they are not the answer."</TE>

<HD>Toll Board Sees a Merger as Cure for Its Ills</HD>
<DH>Transportation: An Orange County agency wants to join with
another so its underused, debt-ridden route can be helped by two that
attract more drivers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with a shortage of customers and dire financial warnings,
directors for the San Joaquin Hills toll road on Thursday authorized
a merger with a second county toll agency in an effort to deal with
the turnpike's growing debt.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous vote comes nearly three months after a major Wall
Street ratings agency downgraded more than $1 billion in San Joaquin
toll road bonds to junk status because traffic and revenue for the
15-mile highway continued to fall far short of projections.</LD>
<LD>   Board members for the second toll agency, which oversees the other
two Orange County tollways, the Eastern and Foothill, are scheduled
to cast a deciding vote on a merger June 13.</LD>
<TE>   The San Joaquin has struggled financially from the start, never
quite recovering from its early years, when revenue dipped to only
50% of projections.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of financial analysts, which examined the toll agency's
ledger books and recommended a merger, said that even with an
infusion of up to $400 million, the agency would fail to establish
long-term financial stability.</TE>
<TE>   Directors of the San Joaquin were warned Thursday that without
quick action--such as a merger--the agency would miss crucial bond
payments as early as 2005 and would probably default by 2012 unless
revenue grew 11.5% annually.</TE>
<TE>   The toll for drivers on the San Joaquin was recently raised to a
maximum of $3 for a one-way trip, which could eventually generate
needed revenue--or, as some suggest, discourage customers. A further
rate hike is not anticipated right now.</TE>
<TE>   A merger of the two toll agencies, creating a single board and
combining all revenue and debt, would put the joint debt at roughly
$4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have previously worried that while a merger could prop up
the San Joaquin's sagging finances, it could drag down the more
successful Eastern and Foothill tollways.</TE>
<TE>   That second toll agency is operating at a much healthier 110% of
projected revenue. At least one of its board members is eager to
consider a merger.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the toll roads have been a success and we want to
continue along in that vein," said Peter Herzog, a Lake Forest city
councilman. "This is just some of the bumps and grinds."</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin, which stretches from Newport Beach to San Juan
Capistrano, has had its share of bumps. In January, revenue was 82%
of projections but has since slipped to 77%, said board Chairwoman
Linda Lindholm, a Laguna Niguel city councilwoman.</TE>
<TE>   "Each month it went down, and when it hit 77%, I told myself I
don't think we are going to make our debt [payments]," Lindholm said.
"Now is the time to take these steps."</TE>
<TE>   If the board failed to act, it ran the risk of creating a domino
effect that could further erode Wall Street's ratings of the toll
bonds, undermine the agency's borrowing ability and affect other toll
agencies, said analyst Mark T. Young.</TE>
<TE>   Young said another ratings downgrade is likely without a merger.</TE>
<TE>   Previous downgrades have already hurt toll road investors by
lowering the value of $789 million in uninsured bonds issued in 1997
and $220 million in revenue bonds sold in 1993. An additional $795
million in San Joaquin Hills bonds sold by the agency in 1997 still
retain an AAA rating because they are insured.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Diehl, chairman of the Foothill/Eastern toll board, said a
decision whether to merge will come down to "what is the best for all
of Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill/Eastern agency still hopes to add a 16-mile southern
extension that would eventually serve San Clemente and push into San
Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you what the vote will be in two months, but we
would be foolish if we didn't take a look at what is the best
structure for us," Diehl said. "We still have quite a bit of
[research] for our board to do."</TE>
<TE>   A merger would allow the joint $4 billion in debt to be
restructured under a new agency, analysts said.</TE>

<HD>UC Finds Spot for Student</HD>
<DH>Education: Santa Cruz campus will admit South Korea
resident who was one of 105 people mistakenly accepted at UC Davis.
He had turned down only other offer.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the students involved in the UC Davis admissions office
foul-up--a glitch involving 105 rejected applicants mistakenly sent
acceptance letters--has found another home in the UC system.</LD>
<LD>   The student, S.K. Lee, a 19-year-old from South Korea, has
accepted a hastily arranged offer to attend UC Santa Cruz.</LD>
<LD>   His lawyer, Benjamin Y. Kim of El Segundo, said Lee had turned
down the other university that admitted him, Hanyang University in
South Korea, after receiving his bogus acceptance letter from UC
Davis.</LD>
<TE>   After Lee received a "notice of error" from UC Davis, he was left
with no arrangement to attend college in the coming school year. As a
result, Davis admissions officials contacted their counterparts at
Santa Cruz, and Lee was admitted there. Lee, who was born in New York
but raised mainly in South Korea, plans to major in psychology at UC
Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 105 affected applicants, the only other one known to have
appealed wasn't as lucky as Lee. Yuta Sakane, a senior at a German
American school in Berlin, was turned down in his appeal to UC Davis.</TE>
<TE>   However, Sakane was accepted at other U.S. schools, and said
Thursday that he expects to attend the Maryland Institute College of
Art.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans for a 202-unit apartment complex near equestrian land in
eastern Simi Valley were stalled this week by the city's Planning
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioners voted 4 to 1 Wednesday to deny a proposal to greatly
increase the density allowed on the six-acre site proposed for the
apartments. Zoning does not currently allow an apartment complex.</LD>
<LD>   The majority of commissioners said the proposed Spanish Villas at
the Park complex was not compatible with the rural character of the
neighborhood. The vote followed an outcry by horse owners and other
residents on nearby Leeds Street.</LD>
<TE>   City policy allows Los Angeles-based MW Development and Simi
Valley Investment Co. to ask the City Council to reverse the Planning
Commission's ruling in the coming weeks.</TE>

<LD>As far as the Baltimore Orioles are concerned, Pedro Martinez already
is back to peak form.</LD>
<LD>   The three-time Cy Young Award winner made his second consecutive
exceptional start, limiting the Orioles to one hit in seven innings
as the Boston Red Sox avoided a three-game sweep with a 7-0 victory
Thursday at Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez (3-0) had a season-high 10 strikeouts and held Baltimore
hitless until Gary Matthews Jr. lined a clean single to right with
two out in the sixth. He walked one and hit a batter.</LD>
<TE>   In his previous outing on April 19, Martinez gave up only one hit
in eight innings against Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   "Pedro has done this to a lot of other clubs," Baltimore Manager
Mike Hargrove said. "Good pitching will stop good hitting, and Pedro
was awfully good today."</TE>
<TE>   Limited to 18 starts last year because of tendinitis in his right
shoulder, Martinez has given up only four earned runs in his last
four starts after being tagged for seven earned runs in three innings
against Toronto on opening day, dropping his ERA from 21.00 to 3.38.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 6, New York 2--Miguel Tejada hit a three-run homer, Greg

<TE>   Texas 11, Toronto 9--Pinch-hitter Herbert Perry tied the score

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Eckstein Wants More Walks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The job of a leadoff man is to get on base any way he can, but one
way shortstop David Eckstein gets on base is risky for the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Eckstein's .333 on-base percentage ranks second on the team to
outfielder Orlando Palmeiro, but he has drawn only two walks while
being hit by a pitch five times.</LD>
<LD>   Getting hit by a pitch is a trademark for Eckstein, who set a
major league rookie record by being hit 21 times last season.
Eckstein, who stands so close to the plate that a wayward inside
pitch often hits him, has been hit at least 20 times in each of his
four full seasons in pro ball and never has been seriously injured.</LD>
<TE>   He did suffer a broken hand when hit by a pitch in a college
summer league, and such an injury now could devastate the Angels.
Backup shortstop Benji Gil is on the disabled list because of a
severely sprained ankle--his return is not imminent--and top
shortstop prospect Alfredo Amezaga is batting .200 at triple-A Salt
Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, I'm not going up there trying to get hit," Eckstein
said. "I've been fortunate enough to get hit in spots where it hasn't
caused much damage."</TE>
<TE>   It is less painful, and just as productive, to draw a walk.
Eckstein drew 43 last season, a number he doubled in his best minor
league seasons. As a patient hitter, and one listed at 5 feet 8, it
is almost inconceivable he has drawn only two walks in 21 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely need to be walking more," he said. "You want to work
the pitcher as best you can. But right now, a lot of people are
throwing a lot of strikes, and you don't want to take them and hope
they get called balls."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Sele won 32 games in his two years with the Seattle
Mariners. The Mariners did not offer him a contract last winter, and
club officials told him they preferred to spend their money on
offense.</TE>
<TE>   But after the Mariners reportedly offered a four-year contract in
excess of $30 million to pitcher Jason Schmidt, suspicion mounted
that the Mariners were concerned Sele, 31, would not remain
productive for the life of a long-term contract.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt eventually re-signed with the San Francisco Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Sele signed with the Angels for three years and $24 million, the
richest contract the team has awarded to a free-agent pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   In his first four starts for the Angels, Sele is 0-2 with a 6.65
earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   In an ESPN column last week, Peter Gammons quoted an unnamed scout
on Sele thusly: "I think he is in decline. Still a pro and a smart
pitcher but the decline in his stuff barely allows him to compete at
this level."</TE>
<TE>   Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said during the Angels' visit to
Seattle this week: "I don't see that. He's a pitcher that will
compete very well. He'll give you innings and give your team the
opportunity to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he a shutout-type pitcher? No. But there aren't too many of
those around."</TE>

<HD>Rockies' James Fights With Cab Driver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colorado Rockies' reliever Mike James fought the cab driver who
brought him to Cinergy Field for a game Thursday night in Cincinnati
and wound up with scrapes and torn clothes.</LD>
<LD>   James said the driver went in the wrong direction, then took
offense when he told him to turn around. They fought after the driver
dropped him off at a stadium gate.</LD>
<LD>   The right-hander said he wasn't seriously hurt and was available
to pitch against the Reds. He didn't plan to file a police report,
and police said the cab driver had not filed a report Thursday
evening.</LD>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate you can't pick your cab driver," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rockies' Manager Buddy Bell talked to James after he arrived in
the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   James, a former Angel, had scrapes above his eye, on his cheek and
along the side of his neck following the fight. He also tore his
pants.</TE>
<TE>   He said the cab driver went in the wrong direction after picking
him up from the team's downtown hotel, heading past Paul Brown
Stadium and away from Cinergy Field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Athletics exercised their 2003 option on Manager Art
Howe, who has led the team to consecutive playoff appearances.</TE>
<TE>   With a move called "just a formality" by General Manager Billy
Beane, Oakland added another year to its commitment to Howe, the A's
manager since 1996. Back then, Howe had a two-year contract with a
one-year option--and he's been working year to year ever since.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Johnson broke the middle finger on his pitching hand in a
freak mishap, an injury that will sideline the Baltimore Oriole
right-hander for about three weeks. The Orioles put Johnson on the
15-day disabled list. Johnson fractured his finger on the hard dirt
of the mound while going through his pitching motion.... St. Louis
put left-hander Bud Smith on the 15-day disabled list because of a
strained left shoulder, the fifth Cardinal starting pitcher to be
sidelined this season.... Toronto pitcher Chris Carpenter returned to
the 15-day disabled list because of right shoulder tendinitis.... New
York Yankee pitcher Sterling Hitchcock gave up one run and three hits
over six innings in a minor league rehab start for Class-A Tampa. It
was Hitchcock's second start since being put on the 15-day disabled
list because of a lower back strain.</TE>

<KH>PORTLAND NOTES</KH>
<HD>Anderson Rebounds From Flu</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Anderson, a reserve guard who sparked the Trail Blazers when
Ruben Patterson and Bonzi Wells were ineffective in Game 1, managed
to play 25 minutes Thursday despite not practicing Monday and Tuesday
due to stomach flu.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson was able to work out Wednesday, but Trail Blazer Coach
Maurice Cheeks didn't declare him fit to play until Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Cheeks had been so concerned about the former Clipper
that he told Portland reporters Tuesday he would visit his home to
deliver a meal and check on him personally. Cheeks ended up calling
Anderson instead.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm sure he's going to be a little weaker than he was Sunday,"
Cheeks said of Anderson, who had 22 points on eight-of-14 shooting in
Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Cheeks planned to test Anderson in Game 2, bringing him in earlier
than usual. Anderson entered with 4:50 left in the first quarter. He
scored six points in 13 minutes by halftime and finished with 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Dale Davis took three shots, making one, and had five
rebounds in 24 foul-plagued minutes in Game 1. Cheeks believed it was
important to keep Davis on the floor and get him more involved
offensively in Game 2. Instead, Davis was ejected in the third
quarter after two technical fouls with five points and seven
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When a reporter asked Cheeks about coaching his first playoff
game, Portland's first-year coach quickly corrected him. "Two playoff
games now," he said with a chuckle. "I'm pretty much the same as I
was as a player. [Besides], it's not about me, it's about our players
on the court."</TE>

<HD>Kiper Had Tremendous Upside for Television</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mel Kiper Jr. used to have competition for being the king of the
draftniks, says Bob Sansevere of the St. Paul Pioneer Press.</LD>
<LD>   Then TV put Kiper clearly in the forefront.</LD>
<LD>   "Mel Kiper won't remind anyone of Mel Gibson," said Sansevere,
"but the other draftnik extraordinaire, Joel Buchsbaum, looks like he
stepped off the set of 'Revenge of the Nerds.' While Kiper got to
stay in front of the camera, Buchsbaum was asked to never leave his
mother's basement again."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Laker record for playoff field-goal
percentage?</TE>
<TE>   Hick image: Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette acknowledged
that "Pittsburghers love to make fun of West Virginia."</TE>
<TE>   For example, he says that Don Ireland, who worked as the
public-address announcer at Pitt football games, became famous with
this little joke: "At a Pitt-West Virginia game, Ireland informed the
crowd that a tractor with West Virginia plates had its lights on. The
license plate, Ireland said, was E-I-E-I-O."</TE>
<TE>   Now you know: Mary Newton Bruder writes a column called "The
Grammar Lady" for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. A reader wanted to
know the origin of the word "bunt" in baseball. Her reply: "The word,
meaning to push or shove, comes from the British dialect of 1760-70
as a variant of butt--the action of a goat pushing its head against
something."</TE>
<TE>   Weighty matter: Maryland football Coach Ralph Friedgen, who weighs
about 350 pounds, has asked boosters to donate $1,000 a pound if he
can lose 50 pounds. Ultimately he'd like to shed 100.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gordon of the St. Louis Dispatch wonders: "Does this mean
that Maryland will schedule fewer cupcakes on its nonconference
schedule?"</TE>
<TE>   Oakspeak: Charles Oakley of the Toronto Raptors, commenting on the
Celtics in the playoffs: "Boston had its ups and downs. Now they're
back. They got the transmission fixed and they're back on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the high-dollar teams are flipping around now. They're
still high-dollar, but they're flipping."</TE>
<TE>   They keep on going: If experience is the determining factor, don't
be surprised if the Utah Jazz upsets the Sacramento Kings in their
NBA playoff series. John Stockton played in his 175th playoff game
and Karl Malone in his 165th Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Scandalous: An item in Newswire on Thursday said that U.S. table
tennis player Barney Reed Jr. was suspended for two years for a
doping violation.</TE>
<TE>   Who's next? A marbles champion?</TE>
<TE>   Really? Ed Sherman in the Chicago Tribune: "You have to feel sorry
for the people trying to write promos for Bulls' games. A late-season
WGN-Channel 9 ad for a recent Bulls-Toronto game actually said, 'Both
teams want to win, but only one can.'"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Kurt Rambis, 59.2%.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "We recently
discussed the possibility Rick Reilly may become the first
millionaire sportswriter if he accepts an offer from ESPN the
Magazine after his current $500,000-or-thereabouts contract with
Sports Illustrated expires in November."</TE>
<TE>   Reilly is a former Times sportswriter.</TE>

<KH>COLLEGE BASEBALL ERIC STEPHENS</KH>
<HD>Peavey Experiences Power Surge at USC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On college baseball's biggest stage last year, USC's Bill Peavey
realized that he could be a big-time performer.</LD>
<LD>   In the Trojans' College World Series opener against Georgia, the
immense first baseman hit two home runs in an 11-5 victory. In his
first CWS at-bat, Peavey hit a pitch from Jeremy Brown well over a
30-foot wall in straightaway center field.</LD>
<LD>   USC didn't win another game in the tournament and Peavey didn't
get another hit. But the blast left an impression.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, it was definitely one of the highlights of my career," he
said. "I hit that one pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Peavey has been making a big impression on Pacific 10 Conference
pitchers lately. The senior took apart Washington State last weekend
with nine hits, including three home runs and three doubles, in 11
at-bats. The performance earned him national player of the week. He
added another home run Tuesday in a 10-8 victory over No. 25 San
Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   Peavey is hitting .390 with 11 home runs and 51 runs batted in,
surpassing last year's totals of seven homers and 48 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Mike Gillespie has wondered why it has taken the
6-foot-4, 245-pound Peavey longer to become the slugger he was
expected to be when he arrived on campus. "He came in as this big guy
that supposedly had all this power and you only saw it from time to
time," Gillespie said. "But confidence does a lot for a person. I
think what he did in Omaha did wonders for him."</TE>
<TE>   Peavey was determined to have a big senior season. He worked out
rigorously last summer in his hometown of Brisbane, a suburb of San
Francisco. He maintains his routine during the season, often arriving
at Dedeaux Field in the morning to do agility drills.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that I was a little big," Peavey said. "I was overweight.
I needed to drop 15 to 20 pounds and I think I picked up a lot more
flexibility."</TE>
<TE>   Peavey went undrafted out of high school but he is playing his way
into the June amateur draft. Gillespie is impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been a tireless worker in the weight room," the veteran
coach said. "I think he deserves a ton of credit for that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge (29-13, 9-3) is back in the Top 25 for the
first time since the preseason. The No. 23 Matadors will try to stay
there in a big three-game Big West Conference series at No. 11 Cal
State Fullerton (29-12, 10-2).</TE>
<TE>   Northridge is one game behind first-place Fullerton and a half
game behind second-place Long Beach State. Tonight's series opener
features Matador left-hander Bill Murphy (8-2, 2.85) against
Fullerton right-hander Wes Littleton (7-2, 1.46).</TE>
<TE>   Both teams are hot. Fullerton has won seven in a row and 15 of 18.
Northridge has won 10 of 12.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Long Beach (26-12, 8-1) got ready for its Big West series

<HD>Little Things Add Up to a 3-2 Dodger Defeat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Maybe it was the lethargic feeling that often accompanies a day game
after a night game in the Eastern time zone, but the Dodgers seemed
to be in a bit of a haze Thursday in their 3-2 loss to the Pirates,
and it had little to do with Pittsburgh starter Josh Fogg.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger pitcher Hideo Nomo issued six free passes in six
innings--five walks and one hit batter--and three eventually scored.
Nomo also failed to get a sacrifice bunt down after Chad Kreuter's
leadoff double in the fifth.</LD>
<LD>   First baseman Paul Lo Duca's throwing error in the third keyed the
Pirates' two-run inning, Cesar Izturis was thrown out in the eighth
inning on an ill-advised attempt to advance to third on a grounder to
the hole at short, and the Dodgers went one for 10 with runners in
scoring position.</LD>
<TE>   Those were far too many shortcomings for the Dodgers to overcome
against seven Pirate pitchers before 16,264 in PNC Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have won this game," Lo Duca said. "We had some good
at-bats, but we didn't get the hits when we needed them. It was one
of those games where we weren't shut down. We could have scored eight
or nine runs, and we only scored two."</TE>
<TE>   That's two more than Lo Duca felt the Pirates should have scored
in the third inning. Pittsburgh had runners on first and second with
one out after Jack Wilson was hit by a pitch to lead off, Fogg bunted
him to second and Adrian Brown walked.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham Nunez grounded to Lo Duca, the Dodger catcher who was
making his second start of the season at first base. Lo Duca fielded
the ball cleanly and took one step toward first before shifting gears
and throwing low and away to second for an error that allowed the
Pirates to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo got Jason Kendall to pop to second for the second out, but
Brian Giles ripped a two-run single to right for a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's plain and simple, I throw the ball 80 feet--it's not that
hard--we win the game," Lo Duca said. "My first inclination was to
step on first base to get the second out, but I turned and threw to
second. I didn't set my feet, and my mechanics weren't good. As soon
as I showed indecision, I should have gone to first."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca would not cite inexperience at the position as a factor.</TE>
<TE>   "I played 30 games there last year and made only one error, and it
wasn't a throwing error," Lo Duca said. "It's not that hard of a
play. The bottom line is it cost us the game."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca may have been too hard on himself. His error was costly,
but it was not the only play that cost the Dodgers the game and a
chance for a three-game sweep of the National League Central
Division-leading Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Though Manager Jim Tracy would not criticize Izturis' decision in
the eighth, his attempt to take third was certainly questionable.
With the Dodgers trailing, 3-1, the speedy 22-year-old opened the
inning with a flare to right field that Rob Mackowiak dropped for a
two-base error.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca followed with a slow roller to the left side. The general
rule for a runner on second is to hold on a grounder in front of you,
but Izturis took off for third. Wilson, the Pirate shortstop,
shoveled to third baseman Mike Benjamin, who applied the tag.</TE>
<TE>   Had Izturis held, Lo Duca might have beat out the grounder for a
single. At the very least, instead of a runner on second with one
out, the Dodgers had a runner on first.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to berate a guy for doing that," Tracy said of
Izturis. "He felt he could make it, and it was a slow-hit ball. It
wasn't a negative in this game."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca was forced at second on Shawn Green's fielder's choice,
Brian Jordan was hit by a pitch, and Adrian Beltre's RBI single
pulled the Dodgers within 3-2. But Pirate first baseman Kevin Young
made a nice stab of Mark Grudzielanek's hard grounder down the line
to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo (2-3) emerged from Thursday's game with a 2.35 earned-run
average in five starts, but control problems have been a recurring
theme--in his three losses, Nomo has walked 15 and hit a batter.</TE>
<TE>   A leadoff walk to Armando Rios in the sixth was also costly
Thursday. Craig Wilson bunted Rios to second, and Jack Wilson's
two-out RBI single gave Pittsburgh a 3-1 lead and its eventual
winning run.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving up walks is something that can't be helped," Nomo said
through an interpreter. "I'm not really bothered by them. I'm more
bothered by the fact we lost the game. Walks are part of the game,
but one reason we lost today is I failed to get a bunt down."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Green (.220) May Be Trying Too Hard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Shawn Green leads the Dodgers with three home runs and 14 runs batted
in, but the right fielder hasn't been an offensive force. He's
batting .220, the lowest average of any regular, has more strikeouts
(22) than hits (18), and has grounded into a team-high five double
plays.</LD>
<LD>   "He's pressing a bit, trying too hard, trying to do too much--I
know because I was in the same boat not too long ago," left fielder
Brian Jordan said. "He's swinging at a lot of pitches, and I know
he's more patient than that.</LD>
<LD>   "But sometimes when you're trying to do too much, you start
swinging at everything. It's like you look at the strikes and swing
at the balls. That's when you know you're pressing."</LD>
<TE>   Green's hard first-inning single to center field Thursday against
the Pirates snapped an 0-for-12 skid. He also knocked in a run with a
fourth-inning groundout.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one swing away from being very good," Manager Jim Tracy
said. "He could take one swing, and everything will be good for the
next 500-something at-bats. I don't worry about this guy.... He's
struggling. I've seen this before. It's not something we need to push
the panic button about."</TE>
<TE>   Green, who bounced back from a similar season-opening, two-week
slump last season to hit .297 with 49 homers and 125 RBIs, said he
hasn't felt very comfortable in the batter's box.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty obvious, I think," Green said. "I'm swinging at bad
pitches and fouling off good ones to hit. I've got to battle through
it. If I throw together a few good at-bats, that will be a good
starting point. Right now I'm just trying to scratch and contribute
where I can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No matter how hard pitcher Omar Daal or his agent pushes for a
trade, the Dodger left-hander isn't going anywhere right now. Daal,
who is 2-0 with a 1.31 earned-run average in two starts for injured
ace Kevin Brown, wants to be a full-time starter but will return to
the bullpen when Brown comes off the disabled list, probably Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't consider it--it doesn't make sense for our club,"
General Manager Dan Evans said. "Until Brown and [Andy] Ashby are
completely healthy and have thrown a number of games, it doesn't make
sense...."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brown, on the disabled list because of an inflamed elbow, threw 61
pitches off a mound Thursday and reported no pain, no problems, and
no increased swelling. The right-hander will throw another bullpen
session Saturday and is expected to be activated Tuesday night.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Cubs are among baseball's biggest disappointments, a

Sammy Sosa is batting .320 with eight home runs but has only 12 RBIs.
Cleanup batter Fred McGriff (.225) has struggled, and No. 5 hitter
Moises Alou (.158) is off to a slow start after missing 14 games
because of a strained right calf. Left-handers Perez, Kazuhisa Ishii
and Daal are a combined 8-1 with a 2.37 ERA in 10 starts.</TE>

<HD>GAME 2 REPORT</HD>
<DH>Charting The Lead: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PORTLAND 18 LAKERS 27</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: In the days since Game 1, Portland Coach Maurice
Cheeks talked at length about getting better shots, showing more
patience with the ball and playing tighter defense on the Laker
guards. So what happens? The Trail Blazers were impatient and only
occasionally shadowed Kobe Bryant and Derek Fisher with any
determination as they moved up the court. So far, listening to their
coach and shooting do not appear to be Trail Blazer strengths.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: What possible reason could there be for the
Trail Blazers' reluctance to follow Cheeks' game plan? Oh yeah, that
has been their method of operation for years.</LD>
<TE>   Winning number: The Lakers led by as many as 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Trail Blazers made six of 22 shots (27.3%) and
Rasheed Wallace missed all six of his attempts, bad omens for
starters for a team in desperate need of positive developments.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant, Fisher 7; Trail Blazers--Bonzi
Wells 6, Dale Davis 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Samaki Walker 8, Shaquille O'Neal 5;
Trail Blazers--Davis 5, Scottie Pippen 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   PORTLAND 37 LAKERS 51</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The Trail Blazers continued to brick their way
toward another early playoff elimination, missing 15 of 22 shots.
They played well enough defensively to put themselves into the game,
but they couldn't seem to make a shot outside of a few feet.
Meanwhile, the Lakers were making 21 of 42 (50%) by halftime and were
threatening to turn Game 2 into a runaway. Wallace finally made a
basket, but he scored only eight points in the half on four-for-13
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Ruben Patterson, self-proclaimed
Kobe-stopper, spiked the ball in anger after committing a needless
foul in the final moments of the quarter. Fisher made two free
throws, giving the Lakers a 14-point lead at the break. Nice way to
end another poor half.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Bryant made three of six shots, a sign that he's
picking his spots against Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Trail Blazers also can't seem to make free
throws, hitting only five of eight.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 7, Fisher, Devean George 5; Trail
Blazers--Wallace 8, Wells 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 4, George 3; Trail
Blazers--Wallace 3, Derek Anderson 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   PORTLAND 63 LAKERS 77</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Tick, tick, tick. You knew it was only a matter of
time before the Trail Blazers lost their cool. It happened, as if on
cue, when Davis got angry after he was called for a foul. Davis spied
the bouncing basketball and booted it into the stands, drawing his
second technical foul of the quarter and earning an early trip to the
locker room. Davis also left his teammates without their starting
center. Wallace and Shawn Kemp had to guard O'Neal for the final
16:12. Remember Game 2 last year when the Trail Blazers drew five
technical fouls in the first quarter?</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Why not a 20-point Laker lead by now? The
Lakers seemed to be playing only well enough to frustrate the Trail
Blazers, which isn't all that difficult, come to think of it.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers:  L.A.'s Kings 1, Colorado 0 in overtime. Good
morning, Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: A 6-foot-11, 225-pound guy (Wallace) cannot defend
a 7-1, 335-pound dude (O'Neal). It's the law of the court.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 13, Bryant 6; Trail
Blazers--Wallace 13, Pippen 7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 4, Robert Horry 2; Trail
Blazers--Wallace 5, Pippen, Davis 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   PORTLAND 96 LAKERS 103</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Horry blocked Wallace's layup, sending Bryant and
O'Neal off on a break with only Pippen back for the Trail Blazers.
O'Neal, streaking toward the basket, accepted a pass from Bryant on
the left wing and soared over Pippen to deliver a thunderous
left-handed dunk. It gave the Lakers an 87-67 lead with 8:30
remaining. Game over? Not so fast, the Trail Blazers would cut the
Laker lead to 98-92 before running out of gas in the final moments.
Bring on San Antonio in the next round. Or is it Seattle? Or Utah? Or
Sacramento? Whatever. It doesn't seem to matter. The Lakers keep
finding ways to win.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A calm, cool and collected group of Trail
Blazers. At this rate, Game 3 on Sunday will mark the final time this
explosive group of personalities will be together. Look for an
overdue overhaul this off-season in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Bryant had only 19 points, but O'Neal scored 31.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Trail Blazers failed to shoot better than 40%
for the second game in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 8, Fisher, Rick Fox, 4; Trail
Blazers--Pippen, Wallace 10.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Bryant 4, Fox 3; Trail Blazers--Pippen
4.</TE>

they had talked about for three days, like posting up Rasheed
Wallace, Bonzi Wells and Ruben Patterson, and instead fired away from
the perimeter, missing most of them, trailing by 21 and finally
losing, 103-96.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Patterson committed a flagrant foul against Shaquille
O'Neal. And Dale Davis got two technicals 27 seconds apart in the
third period, the second for kicking the ball--not that he was tired
of playing Shaq or anything--was ejected and tore off his jersey as
he stomped off to the dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   This is also a Laker-Trail Blazer tradition. A year ago, Davis
elbowed Robert Horry in the throat in Game 2 and was suspended for
Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the Blazers, they're still the Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to compose myself," Coach Maurice Cheeks said at the
postgame news conference. "So I don't get a technical....</TE>
<TE>   "We lost a little composure. It was a little disappointing that we
did it, because for the most part we've been pretty good all year
long and in the first game.</TE>
<TE>   "Had we not lost our composure ... because we made an incredible
run to get back into the game....</TE>
<TE>   "It's just something that had to be addressed and it was
addressed."</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the Trail Blazers squabbled among themselves so badly,
they may not have noticed the playoffs had started. They now have a
new coach, Cheeks, whom they like ... which, of course, just gives
them one less thing to complain about.</TE>
<TE>   As was the case with Mike Dunleavy a year ago, Cheeks seems less
like a basketball coach and more like a juggler ... on a log floating
on the river ... surrounded by alligators.</TE>
<TE>   The hits just keep happening--Ts, ejections, distractions. Damon
Stoudamire, the Portland native who is one of their most personable
and popular players, next week will go before a grand jury that will
vote on whether to indict him on felony drug charges. The case is
scheduled to be heard May 2--the day between Games 4 and 5 of this
series, should they be needed.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire went one for eight from the floor in Game 1, scoring
four points, and all but admitted later his court case is getting to
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I have too many things going on inside my mind right now," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Said co-captain Scottie Pippen between games, in what didn't seem
a suggestion of perfect confidence:</TE>
<TE>   "I hope our mind-set is fine. I don't know what everybody is going
through in their personal lives--I'm sure we all have our different
issues--but we can't bring them onto the basketball court.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all I can say. We have to try to focus on what we have to
do in our job and whatever is going wrong, you can deal with after
the season or after the game is over with.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm talking about everybody in general. We can't bring our
personal problems on the court with us."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, Stoudamire went one for seven from the floor, scoring
two points, with or without his personal problems.</TE>
<TE>   For the Lakers, this was like ordering out for pizza, or in this
case pigeons.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, you may remember, weren't red-hot coming into the
postseason, nor were they overwhelming in Game 1, but they looked
better in Game 2 and now are feeling better about themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The Blazers are checking availability at resorts in the Caribbean
and South Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "I think L.A. right now with Shaq leaves you thinking night in,
night out whether or not you're really going to be able to contain
him," Pippen said before the game. "And when you are able to contain
him, can you keep the other guys from having big, big games?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that a lot of teams had better ways of figuring us [the
Michael Jordan-Pippen Bulls, who won six titles] than we're able to
figure out Shaq....</TE>
<TE>   "I still feel good about our chances in the series. It's a fun
series. It's one that, you know you're playing against the best team
out there right now. If you can just compete with them and get a game
away from them....</TE>
<TE>   "That's what our goal is, to try to get a game. Then we can feel
real good about ourselves going home with the series tied."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they're going home 0-2. You can't win them all, or in the
Blazers' case in this rivalry recently, very many of them.</TE>

<KH>HORSE RACING BILL CHRISTINE</KH>
<HD>No Maybes About It, Mabee Was the Boss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Mabee had a lot of horses. Some said that he had just as many
trainers.</LD>
<LD>   Mabee, who died Wednesday night near Del Mar, the racetrack he
loved and nourished, waded into racing by buying a couple of cheap
yearlings in 1957, did a crash study of the breeding side of the
business several years later and by the 1970s no one connected with
his burgeoning racing and breeding operation doubted who was in
charge. Short on stature, Mabee was a show-up guy who ruled with a
big stick. In the insurance game, Mabee was a CEO who was known to
sign every claim check, and in racing every one of his horses bore
the owner's fingerprints.</LD>
<LD>   He made the rounds of trainers at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park, Del
Mar and Northern California tracks, hiring Hall of Famers such as
Charlie Whittingham, Ron McAnally and Richard Mandella to train his
horses, but also giving the so-called little guys such as Ian Jory a
chance.</LD>
<TE>   Indicative of Mabee's demanding ways was that Best Pal, his best
horse, had three trainers. The first was Jory, only 31 when the
2-year-old gelding came to his barn in the spring of 1990.</TE>
<TE>   If Mabee had known that Best Pal had much of a future, it's
unlikely the horse would have been sent to the little-known Jory.</TE>
<TE>   But Best Pal and Jory were a good team, winning races from the
start, and by the end of the year Mabee's horse was one of the best
juveniles in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble was, Best Pal picked the biggest race of his young career
to run his worst race. Later he showed that by and large the deeper
Eastern tracks would always be to his disliking, but in 1990, at the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Belmont Park, nobody knew.</TE>
<TE>   Because Best Pal hadn't been nominated as a foal for $500,
Mabee--one of the founding directors and early rule makers of the
Breeders' Cup--had to pay $150,000 to buy his way into the Juvenile.
At 9-5, Best Pal ran sixth, earning $10,000. Even for a plutocrat,
that was a bottom line that was unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Back in California, Best Pal rebounded to win the Hollywood
Futurity under Jory, but the next year he had to hit the road again,
finishing second in the Kentucky Derby and fifth in the Preakness.
Jory didn't know it, but the Silver Screen Handicap at Hollywood Park
in mid-June was his Rubicon. Best Pal was second again, this time on
a track he was supposed to prefer, and Gary Jones was hired to
replace Jory.</TE>
<TE>   "When John Mabee called and asked if I wanted Best Pal, I said
yes," Jones would say later. "Because if I didn't take him, I knew
he'd wind up with some other trainer."</TE>
<TE>   For Jones, Best Pal had some of his finest hours, including
victories in the Pacific Classic, the Santa Anita Handicap and the
Hollywood Gold Cup, but he ran 10th--after Mabee had paid a $360,000
supplement--in the 1993 Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita, and
Jones' days were numbered. When the horse came back from a needed
rest in mid-1994, Mandella was the new trainer. There was one more
Breeders' Cup try--for another $360,000 supplement--and Best Pal
earned $60,000 for finishing fifth at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Mabee's impatience sometimes extended to the press. For one thing,
he blanched at seeing Earl Scheib's name in print, mainly because in
1988 the Los Angeles automobile painter tried to wrest away the
racing license from the Mabee-led Del Mar Thoroughbred Club.</TE>
<TE>   Scheib was the optimist's optimist, applying for a 20-year lease
even though he was well past 80.</TE>
<TE>   As an insurer, Mabee's bag was the lucrative workers' compensation
field, but he also underwrote horses, and in that realm was a step or
two ahead of his clients. Alydar, in stud at Calumet Farm, was
insured for a reported $36.5 million, and Mabee's company was good
for $5 million of it.</TE>
<TE>   By the fall of 1990, Alydar was approaching his 16th birthday, and
Mabee called J.T. Lundy, president of Calumet, to ask that the
coverage be reduced to $2 million after the existing policy ran out
in December. Alydar had been unconscionably overbred, which would
devalue his yearlings, and Mabee knew this. Lundy wouldn't budge, and
in October, Mabee notified Calumet that he wouldn't be insuring
Alydar in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Alydar, in what was described as a stall accident, died under
mysterious circumstances in November 1991. Lundy was found guilty in
2000 of bank fraud, conspiracy and bribery.</TE>
<TE>   Mabee and the other insurers paid off. "We should not have ever
paid the claim," Mabee told The Blood-Horse magazine in 1998,
"because our policy said that if he was insured for more than $21
million [by all companies], the policy was null and void. But they
provided proof of loss, saying that the total was only $21 million."</TE>
<TE>   It was one of those rare times that John Mabee ever backed off.</TE>

<LD>Hollywood Park is not the only track in California where Friday night
racing is resuming.</LD>
<LD>   Approximately 15 minutes after Hollywood Park's opener tonight,
Bay Meadows will also begin to run under the lights, although the
horses didn't flood the entry box for the program.</LD>
<LD>   Only 50 horses are scheduled to run in the eight races. Nine
fillies and mares racing for a $6,250 claiming price in the sixth
race is the night's biggest field. Four races have only six entrants
and two others drew only five.</LD>
<TE>   Locally, things are better. The average field for the nine races
is more than nine, including two races with 12, one with 11 and
another with 10.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the number could shrink, considering how many horses
were scratched off the program two days ago. Fourteen horses were
scratched either in the morning or during the day on the first of 65
programs at Hollywood Park, meaning there were only two races that
had more than eight runners.</TE>
<TE>   The initial Friday night card features the first grade stakes of
the spring-summer season. Six fillies and mares were entered in the
$100,000 Wilshire Handicap, a Grade III at one mile on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Chris McCarron, who has won the race five times, more than any
other jockey, will be a longshot this evening. He will ride Eurolink
Raindance for trainer Ben Cecil. The Irish-bred mare ended a long
losing streak when beating Autumn Rhythm and three others in an
allowance race at Santa Anita last month.</TE>
<TE>   The one to beat is Crazy Ensign. An Argentine-bred mare owned by
El Faruk Stable and trained by Richard Mandella, she won the Miss
America at Bay Meadows three weeks ago and has won six of 16 in her
career. She was a double Group I winner in her native land.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The eighth at Hollywood Park is an interesting
allowance race at seven furlongs. Contention runs deep in the field
of eight.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Julio Canani. The trainer began the meet well, winning
grass races with The Price Spirit and Ladies Din on opening day.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in tonight's second race. The 12 participants
are 0 for 64.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Bull Ryder, Glitterbend and
Full Strike in the sixth, Come Back Ronnie and Road To Slew in the
seventh, singling Rimador in the eighth and using Fresh Broccoli,
Like Magic and Sweet Potato in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/3. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $5/$15. Total money bet: $32.</TE>

<LD>UC Irvine's search for a new athletic director to replace Dan
Guerrero won't begin until next week and figures to last into the
summer.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor Ralph Cicerone said he doesn't have a list of
candidates ready to replace the popular Guerrero. He said he would
put together an on-campus search committee to compile a list of
prospects for a job he said is more attractive than it was in 1992
when Guerrero arrived.</LD>
<LD>   "Because of the state it is in," Cicerone said. "He left it in so
much better condition than when he found it."</LD>
<TE>   Guerrero was hired Thursday as UCLA's athletic director. He will
succeed Pete Dalis.</TE>
<TE>   Cicerone said he plans to hire someone on an interim basis soon.</TE>
<TE>   One possible candidate is Rob Halvaks, an associate commissioner
with the Big West Conference who worked in the Irvine athletic
department for 10 years and still lives in the city. He said he
hasn't given much thought to the position but wouldn't rule out his
interest.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly [hadn't] given any thought about it until
[Commissioner] Dennis [Farrell] brought it up the other day," he
said. "I have been away from campus for 13 years and I'm not really
sure if I want to go back into that school environment."</TE>
<TE>   Another possibility is Cal State Dominguez Hills Athletic Director
Ron Prettyman, who was a finalist for the Cal State Fullerton
opening. Prettyman was out of town and unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Petrina Long, Irvine's senior associate athletic director, said
she will not pursue the position.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Carroll, who was Fullerton's athletic director from 1985-91,
said he had no interest in the job. He is in charge of finance for
Irvine athletics.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>One-third of their top line was missing Thursday night when the Kings
took the ice for Game 5 against the Colorado Avalanche.</LD>
<LD>   Left wing Adam Deadmarsh, who had combined with center Jason
Allison and right wing Ziggy Palffy for seven of the Kings' nine
goals and nine of their 15 assists in the first four games of the
series, stayed home in Manhattan Beach after suffering a strained
neck Tuesday night in Game 4.</LD>
<LD>   "Adam's a fierce competitor and he wants to be in the lineup more
than anything," King Coach Andy Murray said before Game 5, "so
obviously he's not feeling real good about the fact that he's not
capable of playing tonight."</LD>
<TE>   The Kings planned for Deadmarsh to accompany them to Denver, but
with his neck still stiff about an hour before their Wednesday
afternoon flight and no chance that he could play, they opted to have
him treated by a specialist in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Second-line winger Cliff Ronning, who sat out Game 4 because of a
possible concussion, also did not make the trip.</TE>
<TE>   With Deadmarsh sidelined, Murray brought back rookie Jaroslav
Bednar, who played in the first two games of the series before he was
benched. The Czech winger started on the first line, but Murray also
tried Steve Heinze, Craig Johnson and Mikko Eloranta with Allison and
Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh, who suffered a series of nagging, minor injuries in the
first two months of the season, had played in 63 consecutive games.
He accumulated a career-high 62 points in the regular season, among
them 29 goals, and had one goal and three assists in the first three
games against the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   He was injured early in the third period of Tuesday night's 1-0
loss while diving headfirst into the end boards trying to check
Avalanche defenseman Adam Foote. His head at first glanced off
Foote's left leg, perhaps partially cushioning the blow.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it's scary," King center Bryan Smolinski said. "Any
time a guy goes in head-first like that, it's awful. Thank God he's
OK and he's only got a sore neck."</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh's availability for Saturday's game is undetermined.</TE>
<TE>   Ronning's availability is day to day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Avalanche right wing Milan Hejduk, who accounted for 21 goals and
44 points in 62 regular-season games after registering 41 and 79 in
80 games last season, did not play Thursday night. But he is close to
returning to the lineup after sitting out since Feb. 28 because of an
abdominal strain.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically on a day-to-day basis we're going to evaluate his
situation, and when the medical staff feels he's ready to go, he'll
be in the lineup," Coach Bob Hartley said before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not there yet. Things look very promising, but let's stay
calm and take one game at a time."</TE>

be their end, the Kings dramatically extended their season Thursday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Felix Potvin turned aside 26 shots and Craig Johnson scored 2
minutes 19 seconds into overtime, giving the Kings a 1-0 victory over
the Colorado Avalanche in Game 5 of their first-round Stanley Cup
playoff series.</LD>
<LD>   In front of the usual sellout crowd of 18,007 at the Pepsi Center,
defenseman Jaroslav Modry fired a shot at the charging Johnson and
happily saw it deflect off his right skate and past Avalanche
goaltender Patrick Roy.</LD>
<TE>   The victory, which ended an eight-game road winless streak, cut
the Kings' deficit in the series to 3-2, with Game 6 on Saturday at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "They say only good things happen when you put the puck on the
net," Modry said. "I saw Craig wide open in front of the net and
tried to hit him. It worked out good. He's a hero and we're going
back home for Game 6."</TE>
<TE>   A reluctant hero, maybe. Johnson said he only got in the way.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to get to the net and hopefully get a
deflection," he said. "Mo did a great job to get it on net, and I
found some open space and luckily it went in."</TE>
<TE>   The real hero, he said, was Potvin, whose shutout was the eighth
of his career in the playoffs, his third by 1-0 in 12 playoff games
against the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   The play of Potvin and the defense in general helped the Kings win
on the road for the first time since March 18 in a game they started
without wingers Adam Deadmarsh and Cliff Ronning, sidelined because
of injuries, and ended without defenseman Philippe Boucher, who left
in the first period after suffering an eye injury.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a dedicated group," Johnson said. "We've had our backs to
the wall all year. We've fought hard. We just wanted to play another
day."</TE>
<TE>   Only 16 of the 186 teams that had lost three of the first four
games of a best-of-seven NHL playoff series before this season, or
8.6%, had rallied to win the series, but one was the Kings, who did
it against the Edmonton Oilers in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   And, faced with the same predicament last season, the Kings won
Games 5 and 6 against the Avalanche, both 1-0, before losing in Game
7.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have to remind our team of anything," King Coach Andy
Murray said before the game. "They know what's facing them tonight.
They know that we're going to see a formidable opponent, a very
determined opponent on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "Our feeling is that we don't have to win the series tonight. We
have to win one hockey game, and we're more than capable of that."</TE>
<TE>   After last season, the Avalanche didn't need to be reminded.</TE>
<TE>   "You never want to let an underdog stick around any longer than
possible," Avalanche winger Dan Hinote said. "Every game that they're
here, they're going to get stronger, just like they did last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, that's in the back of our head. We know that's part of
their character. They don't ever give up, whether it's 3-1 or 2-0. It
would be us not learning from the past if we were to ignore it. We
learned from it, and we know what to expect."</TE>
<TE>   Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley also knew what to expect, but he said
what happened last year would have little bearing on Thursday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't live in the past," the coach said. "Elvis is dead."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their predicament, the Kings are still very much alive in
the series, though struggling to put the puck into the net.</TE>
<TE>   They hadn't scored against Roy since the second period of their
3-1 victory Monday night in Game 3, a span of 153 minutes 50 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Already without Deadmarsh and Ronning, who didn't make the trip,
they watched Boucher skate off with 4:41 to play in the first period
after a shot by Avalanche defenseman Darius Kasparaitis caromed off
either teammate Stephane Yelle or King defenseman Mattias Norstrom
and struck Boucher above the right eye.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, meanwhile, hasn't fared a lot better against
Potvin. By the time the game ended, they'd scored one goal in more
than 176 minutes, though Steven Reinprecht's second-period goal
Tuesday night at Staples Center was enough for a 1-0 victory in Game
4.</TE>
<TE>   Not even power plays helped. The Kings' league-leading unit, which
had scored once in only six opportunities in the first four games of
the series, had the man-advantage twice in the second period but
managed only two shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche also was 0 for 2 through two periods. It was soon 0
for 3 after its third opportunity expired 17 seconds into the third
period.</TE>
<TE>   About five minutes later, Avalanche captain Joe Sakic rang a shot
from the left point off the crossbar. With 7:43 left in the period,
the Avalanche was given another opportunity, after King defenseman
Mathieu Schneider was called for elbowing Alex Tanguay, again putting
the home team on the power play.</TE>

<KH>LAKER NOTES</KH>
<HD>Jackson, Pippen Certainly Have Special Kind of Rivalry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson always is so sure about Scottie Pippen, because of the
six championship rings and the countless battles they shared.</LD>
<LD>   They admire each other still, to the point where Jackson shouts
things during games, if not at Pippen, then certainly to be heard by
him.</LD>
<LD>   He smiles and Pippen tries not to, but they both know, and usually
that's good enough.</LD>
<TE>   Pippen has not played well against Jackson's Lakers. Maybe it's
because Jackson's Lakers have Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. Maybe
it's because Jackson's Lakers have Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not playing against Phil," Pippen said tersely. "I'm playing
against his team."</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship has remained sturdy, Pippen said, "but I've got
to beat his team."</TE>
<TE>   Asked specifically about his play--he averaged 6.5 points on 26.8%
shooting in four regular-season games--Pippen said, "Season ended up
2-2. So, who cares?"</TE>
<TE>   Not Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "I've not thought about Scottie's game in those terms," Jackson
said. "He's 37? We have to understand this is a basketball player
playing on a terrific level and doing a lot of things for his
basketball team. His poise, his control, his ability to move the
basketball for his team, and do some things defensively that's
important for them all. He's not shot the ball well, and that's just
part of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that Scottie's filled up a lot of stat sheets over the
years, though this isn't a time when stats are important to him. It's
developing his team's game that is."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By the end of June, Jackson could have more playoff wins than any
coach in history.</TE>
<TE>   He has 143 after Thursday's victory. Pat Riley leads, with 155.
Jackson could reach 156, if the Lakers win their third consecutive
NBA title.</TE>
<TE>   Another championship would give Jackson nine as a coach, tying him
with Red Auerbach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers made it clear they intended to take advantage of
Rick Fox in the post in Game 2, particularly with Bonzi Wells.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel as though we don't have anyone to stop it," Fox said.
"I take that as a personal challenge. It's a slap in my face."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers have played more playoff games-- 673 on their
veteran roster entering the postseason--than any team in the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, with 636, ranked second. Robert Horry's 134 playoff
games led the Lakers.</TE>

<HD>Win Fits Lakers to a T</HD>
<DH>Game 2: With O'Neal scoring 31 points and Trail Blazers
missing shots and losing cool, L.A. takes 2-0 edge after 103-96
victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers are a victory from their now annual playoff dismissal of
Portland, that far from leaving the Trail Blazers behind for the
third consecutive season.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal had 31 points and 14 rebounds Thursday night at
Staples Center, and the Trail Blazers were nearly as brutish as they
promised they'd be, and then for fun everyone watched Dale Davis
morph into Dennis Rodman.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers were 103-96 winners, primarily because they maintained
their poise while Maurice Cheeks' guys were kicking theirs around the
arena. But that's an old story for the Trail Blazers, still fragile
after all these years.</LD>
<TE>   "We lost a little composure," Cheeks said after the Trail Blazers
were hit with four technical fouls and the ejection of center Davis.
"I was a little disappointed that we did it."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won the first two games of the best-of-five
series. Game 3 is Sunday at the Rose Garden, where the Lakers will
play for their second first-round sweep of the Trail Blazers in two
years. As it was, they won their sixth consecutive playoff game
against Portland, beginning with the memorable Game 7 of the 2000
Western Conference finals, when the Lakers overcame a 15-point
fourth-quarter deficit to advance to the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   They've all been frantic, it seems. Behind by 21 points halfway
through the final quarter, the Trail Blazers twice drew within six,
causing pileups in the aisles as people stopped on their way up the
stairs to gape.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, just as Scottie Pippen and Rasheed Wallace began to make
shots, a game jammed with 57 personal fouls closed, and all the
Lakers had done by mid-way through the final quarter had held up.</TE>
<TE>   "That game had many faces," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, freed from Game 1's triple-teams by a Trail Blazer defense
that tried to pressure the Lakers into turnovers, made 12 of 20
field-goal attempts and seven of nine free throws. Derek Fisher
scored 18 points, 12 in the first half, and Rick Fox had 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant scored 19 points. He missed 16 of 21 shots, but again
was a regular at the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   "I like playing physical, so when they play physical they're just
playing into my hands," O'Neal said. "And we should have beat this
team by 20."</TE>
<TE>   They didn't because the Trail Blazers got hot in the fourth
quarter, the first of eight in the series in which they shot well.
The rest of the game consisted of the Lakers playing soundly and the
Trail Blazers missing jumpers, and getting angry.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, apparently frustrated by his inability to slow O'Neal and
the officials' inability to help, took two technical fouls within 27
seconds in the third quarter. The second came when he kicked the
basketball into the seats. On his way out, he stripped off his jersey
and scowled at the jeering crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "Guarding Shaq and getting fouls called on him as opposed to not
getting them in return, I think that could be frustrating for him,"
Cheeks said.</TE>
<TE>   By the end, the Trail Blazers also had accumulated a flagrant foul
(by Ruben Patterson, on O'Neal), and two players--Pippen and Bonzi
Wells--fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough when you know what a loss for your basketball team
does in a situation like this in a five-game series," Fisher said,
"so their emotions were running a little higher than they probably
were in [Game 1]."</TE>
<TE>   In between all of that, O'Neal was powerful and clever, scoring on
turnaround jumpers and drop steps and free throws and once, in the
fourth quarter, a left-handed fastbreak dunk that slayed the place.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal shrugged off the flagrant foul, and the Patterson glare,
perhaps because Patterson thought better of the glare and later
apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a playoff game and nothing can really break my composure or
break my spirits," O'Neal said. "We're up two games to none, and we
don't want to go up there and mess around with this team. We're going
to try and do away with them on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   They got around finally to playing Game 2, four days from Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Although so much time had passed between games, the arena had a
playoff vibe that wasn't there Sunday. There were spontaneous
standing ovations and chants for a three-peat, energy not often
evident in afternoon games.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson entered the game with 1:53 left in the first quarter and
was booed. He picked a spot along the lane, smirked and gestured
upward, asking for more, which he got.</TE>
<TE>   A minute later, he thrilled the crowd by taking an eight-foot
jumper and missing it by two feet.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson ended the first quarter defending Robert Horry, but
started the second in his usual place, across from Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers missed 31 of 44 shots in the first half, and so
the Lakers held a 51-37 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Cheeks altered his defense, initially sending Pippen at Rick Fox
and Wells at Bryant. The strategy was to give Pippen the easier
defensive assignment, allowing him to roam and disrupt.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers pressed harder and longer than they had in Game
1. As Patterson had said, "We don't think they have good
ballhandlers."</TE>

<LD>Dan Gurney made a career of building and driving race cars, but on
Wednesday he unveiled his pet project at the Petersen Automotive
Museum, the Limited Edition Grand Prix Alligator motorcycle.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of sitting on top of the motorcycle, the rider sits inside
its elongated design, providing a lower center of gravity and greater
handling.</LD>
<LD>   It also stops on a dime.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll see how much of a niche we have carved out, if any," said
Gurney, who turned 71 on April 13. "If the response is excellent, the
next step will be to get some investment partners and go to the next
threshold, which we haven't defined yet. I've carried this thing [to
this point], now we'll see what it stirs up."</TE>
<TE>   Gurney is producing 36 Alligators--30 of them for sale at
$35,000--out of his All American Racers shop in Santa Ana. Blue with
a white racing stripe, the carbon fiber Alligator weighs 320 pounds
and is coated with the same paint used on the No. 36 Eagle Formula
One car that Gurney raced in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Perry King was the first of about a dozen people who have
bought an Alligator.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got 21 motorcycles, and this is going to be the one I ride
all the time," King said. "It makes you feel like you're in a Formula
car, an open-wheel car but on two wheels."</TE>
<TE>   That isn't surprising. Gurney's team applied many of the design
principles of his race cars to the motorcycle, and he said his son,
Justin, played an integral role in its appearance. It was a project
that had been on the backburner until the demise of All American
Racers' CART team. With the extra time, the Alligator became a focal
point.</TE>
<TE>   Gurney's passion for motorcycles began before he was a teenager
when he read a book written in 1913, "The Speedwell Boys and their
Motorcycle."</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting," said Gurney, who estimated he had invested $10
million in the project. "One of the things that's nice about it,
unlike a racing car--which you cannot taste without being a racing
driver--a street-legal motorcycle is something I can ride and our
friends and customers can ride.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a huge difference. In many respects, there's more freedom
of design for something street legal than racing the way it has
evolved."</TE>
<TE>   The result is a modified Honda four-stroke single, air-cooled,
fuel-injected motorcycle with a top speed of about 140 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing League team owner A.J. Foyt has hired Greg Ray to
drive the No. 11 Chevy-powered Dallara for the rest of the season.
Ray, signed through 2003, replaces Eliseo Salazar, who suffered a
torn vertebral artery in a crash April 16 during testing at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Alta Loma driver Jaques Lazier will probably miss the rest of the
IRL season after surgery Wednesday on a fractured vertebra, suffered
in a crash with Tomas Scheckter in Sunday's Firestone Indy 225 at
Nazareth, Pa. He will wear a brace for eight to 12 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Supercross</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Carmichael can practically assure himself of a second
consecutive EA Sports Supercross title if he can stay on his 250cc
Honda Saturday in Salt Lake City. With 306 points, Carmichael holds a
24-point lead over David Vuillemin of Corona with two races
remaining, including the season-ender May 4 in Las Vegas. Vuillemin,
on a Yamaha, can pick up 25 points with a victory.</TE>
<TE>   With his victory last week in Texas, Hesperia's Travis Preston
moved into the 125cc Western Regional series lead with 130 points on
his Honda, 10 more than 16-year-old phenom James Stewart of Haines
City, Fla., riding for Kawasaki.</TE>
<TE>   Perris</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's Cory Kruseman will be trying to win his third
consecutive main event Saturday at Perris Auto Speedway when Vista
Paint presents the NAPA Auto Parts/Auto Trader Magazines SCRA Sprint
Cars.</TE>
<TE>   Kruseman won 12 times last season at Perris, including six in a
row during one stretch. The 2001 SCRA champion has 54 career
victories, one less than all-time leader Rip Williams of Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove's Tony Jones, who is second in the series, and
third-place Richard Griffin of Silver City, N.M., a three-time
champion, will be in the way of Kruseman; the three are separated by
23 points in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale Speedway will have one of its busiest nights of the year
Saturday when it presents six classes of racing on its two oval
surfaces of third- and half-mile distances.</TE>
<TE>   The Jani-King Late Models compete in Round 2 of the Miller Lite
Big 10 Challenge, along with the American Race Trucks, the Ultra
Wheel Super Trucks, the Grand American Modifieds, the Ford Focus
Midgets and the Russell USAC Triple Crown Pro Series Presented by
Yokahama.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Jim Lewis, who published Hot Rod and Performance magazine and
produced the Action Motorsports trade shows in the 1990s, died April
18. He was 55. A memorial is planned for Tuesday at Joe's Garage, 36
Auto Center Dr., Tustin, at 6 p.m. The family asks that in lieu of

<HD>He's a Little Rusty for Victories</HD>
<DH>NASCAR: Wallace hasn't won since last year at Fontana, and
he would welcome the chance to honor Earnhardt again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year ago, Rusty Wallace won the NAPA Auto Parts 500 at California
Speedway on what would have been the late Dale Earnhardt's 50th
birthday, then he honored the Winston Cup legend by holding a huge
flag with the No.3--Earnhardt's old number--out the window of his
winning Ford Taurus on his victory lap.</LD>
<LD>   Earnhardt, killed on the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500, has
been gone for more than a year now, and Wallace said Thursday that he
no longer thinks of "the Intimidator" every day.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes, it's every other day," he said.</LD>
<TE>   But he still has that flag, and he wouldn't mind getting it out
and flying it again after Sunday's race, what with Monday being
Earnhardt's 51st birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, I'd love to win it again and carry that flag again," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Winning is something Wallace knows lots about. In 22-plus seasons
of Winston Cup racing, he has won 54 times and was NASCAR's champion
in 1989. But it doesn't get any easier and although he's third in the
standings this season, behind leader Sterling Marlin and runner-up
Matt Kenseth, he hasn't motored down Victory Lane since that day here
last April.</TE>
<TE>   "These championships now are coming down to very, very tight
finishes, and so you can't afford to give up anything," he said. "I'm
trying to lead more laps on the racetrack so I can build up those
points--that's real important. Consistency's probably the most
important and that's what we've been this year--real consistent.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been among the top 10 and top five finishers and finishing
the races. My mind is all over the points, but I would like to get a
win knocked out real soon and I can't think of a better track than
right here."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the trying will be more fun on the moderately banked
two-mile track than it was last weekend on the high-banked 2.6-mile
superspeedway at Talladega, Ala., one of two tracks--Daytona is the
other--where NASCAR mandates the use of carburetor restrictor plates,
which slow the cars, leading to pack racing and, almost inevitably,
multi-car accidents. There was a doozy at Talladega, involving 24
cars--the day after a 27-car pileup there in a Busch series race.</TE>
<TE>   "This is completely different," Wallace said. "You can't even
compare it to Daytona and Talladega. Those two racetracks are
unbelievably exciting for the fans, but for a driver, it's like going
to the dentist to get a root canal.</TE>
<TE>   "At the [high-banks], a huge part of it is the car. At tracks like
this, it's more driver and the car. It's more of a 50-50 [breakdown].
At a restrictor-plate racetrack, it's 70% car, 30% driver. At a track
like this, the driver has a ton more input."</TE>
<TE>   In a 500-mile race, drivers like that feeling of control.</TE>
<TE>   "If the race is going real smooth, if you're not having a problem
with tire wear or the way your car is handling, you are definitely
looking at fuel mileage, looking into fuel windows--how far can we
make it on fuel? Can we shortstop this guy?</TE>
<TE>   "The drivers before, they used to kind of say, 'I'm just going to
save my stuff the first half of the race and later on, when it really
counts, we're going for it.'</TE>
<TE>   "But nowadays, the equipment's so good and everybody's having such
good luck with their engines, man, nobody's slowing down. They're
running every single lap like it's a qualifying lap--the whole,
entire 500 miles.</TE>
<TE>   "So if you can get that track position, you keep that car up front
in that clean air, that'll definitely make it handle good and make it
run better. That is super, super important, track position.</TE>
<TE>   "There is strategy--a lot of strategy goes on--but it changes from
pit stop to pit stop. If I had to choose something I really need the
most, I'd say it's handling, making sure the car handles the very
best it possibly can. 'Cause the engine's a given, the pit stops are
a given, so the way to outrun these guys on the racetrack is with a
good-handling race car."</TE>
<TE>   Late-race strategy helped Wallace win here last year. He had a
healthy lead when Mark Martin and Ward Burton tangled on Lap 231 of
the 250-lap race. At first, Wallace was going to pit, figuring
everyone else would go in for fresh rubber. Then he and his crew
reconsidered. He stayed out--and so did everyone else. Then he held
off a charging Jeff Gordon when racing resumed.</TE>
<TE>   If pit stops are a given, as Wallace observed, he is finding they
are not quite the given they were a few seasons ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of conversation going on now during pit stops
because of the hardness of the tires," he said. "Goodyear's built us
a tire that's extremely durable, extremely bulletproof and extremely
hard. Because of that, the tire's not wearing out and, honestly, it's
been real hard to pass because of it. A lot of guys are not even
stopping for tires, or just putting right-side tires on.</TE>
<TE>   "So now they're looking at softening the compound for the second
half of the year.... Racing's got to be a little bit
follow-the-leader 'cause the tires won't wear out and everybody's
cars are handling good and it's hard to pass cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Pit stops have been real tough to figure out lately 'cause, like
I say, some guys don't even pit [when they normally would]. It'd give
you a headache, trying to figure it out, with the cars all running
the same and tires don't wear. You're trying to figure out whether
you need two tires or four tires or just gas."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace figured it out last year. And he may just have it figured
out this year too.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the same car," he said. "It's called Mad Max and it's my
favorite little hot rod."</TE>

<HD>Celtics Put 76ers in Bad Situation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson shook off the rust, but his Philadelphia 76ers couldn't
shake off Paul Pierce.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce made the go-ahead three-point shot with 1:36 left Thursday
night to lead the Boston Celtics to a 93-85 victory over the 76ers at
the FleetCenter and send the defending Eastern Conference champions
to the brink of elimination.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a whole different game in the fourth quarter because
everything's on the line," said Pierce, who overcame early foul
trouble and 10 consecutive misses to score 11 of his 25 points in the
final quarter. "That's when the pressure is on."</LD>
<TE>   Boston took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series despite 29
points from Iverson, who missed the final 14 games of the regular
season because of a broken hand and struggled in the playoff opener.</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 is at Philadelphia on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Not in a million years did I think we'd be in this situation,"
Iverson said. "We are looking forward to going back home and playing
in front of our fans and getting the same energy they had here."</TE>
<TE>   Antoine Walker had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Pierce also had
10 rebounds for the Celtics, who are in the playoffs for the first
time since 1995--the final season of the Boston Garden and before
Walker or Pierce entered the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not playing like it is their first experience in the
playoffs, and I think that's kind of neat," 76er Coach Larry Brown
said. "They're playing with a lot of poise."</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers led, 81-77, with 3:21 left to play when Tony Battie made
a basket and Pierce followed with a jump shot--only his second basket
of the half--to tie it. Pierce followed with a three-point basket
from the right side to give Boston an 84-81 lead it never
relinquished.</TE>
<TE>   Walter McCarty, a reserve who had 16 points in the series opener,
made three of four free throws, had a big rebound and a made key
steal in the final minute. He finished with 10 points.</TE>

<HD>Williams Witness to Testify</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A former college basketball player will testify against Jayson
Williams under a plea bargain in the case of a limousine driver shot
to death inside the former NBA All-Star's estate.</LD>
<LD>   Kent Culuko, 29, pleaded guilty Thursday in Superior Court in
Flemington to tampering with evidence and witnesses. He agreed to
testify against Williams and co-defendant John Gordnick, 44, and
could avoid serving any time in jail under a provision of a state law
for first-time offenders.</LD>
<LD>   Culuko, who played at James Madison, admitted in court that he
wiped the gun and moved it after the shooting and told the other
people in the room to say they were downstairs when it happened.
Culuko said he did these things at Williams' request.</LD>
<TE>   Williams is charged with manslaughter in the Feb. 14 death of limo
driver Costas Christofi. Prosecutors say the co-defendants, both
friends of Williams, tampered with evidence to make it look as if the
victim, not the former New Jersey Net, fired the gun.</TE>
<TE>   Culuko's lawyer said his client soon backed off that claim.</TE>

<HD>Eligibility Rules for Preps Widened</HD>
<DH>NCAA: High school basketball stars can now declare for NBA
draft without losing chance to play in college.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High school basketball players can now declare for the NBA draft and
be drafted without giving up their college eligibility, the NCAA
board of directors decided Thursday, and in a surprising turnaround,
the group determined the rule will be in effect for this year's
draft.</LD>
<LD>   That leaves little time for high school players and their legion
of "advisors" to sort out the advantages and disadvantages.</LD>
<LD>   This much is clear: It's not a free pass to see where a player
stands.</LD>
<TE>   The NCAA earlier was under the impression an NBA team would hold a
players' rights for one year.</TE>
<TE>   But NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre said that under the league's
collective bargaining agreement, a team would hold a players' rights
until one year after his college career, and he could not re-declare
for the draft.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as long as a player doesn't sign a contract or hire an
agent, he would retain his eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   That means a prospect who throws his name in the ring only to see
an NBA team take a flier on him late in the second round still could
go to college, play several seasons and even become national player
of the year. But he couldn't ever become a lottery pick and the team
that drafted him would have dibs, at a bargain price. Nor would an
undrafted player be able to declare for the draft again.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, high school players lost their college eligibility if
they declared for the draft whether they were drafted or not. College
players retain their eligibility if they withdraw before the deadline
or aren't picked, but lose their eligibility if they are drafted.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fair," said Fairfax High Coach Harvey Kitani, the
coach of Evan Burns, the McDonald's All-American who has signed with
UCLA and is expected to play for the Bruins rather than try the NBA.
"It definitely was not right or fair to penalize the high school kid
who did the same thing a college kid did. That wouldn't hold for a
second in a court of law."</TE>
<TE>   The territory isn't entirely foreign to NBA teams, one general
manager pointed out, because they are used to drafting European
players who might not immediately come play in North America.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Blake, the NBA director of scouting, said it could even be
good strategy for an NBA team to take a raw prospect in the second
round and hope he would go to college and develop into a steal of a
player.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're only talking about a few high school kids," he said.
"Somebody thought a bus was going to deliver 100 high school kids. It
hasn't happened."</TE>
<TE>   Though the draft decision is attention-grabbing, Ohio State
President William Kirwin, chair of the NCAA board, called the group's
endorsement of academic reform measures "most significant."</TE>
<TE>   The board voted unanimously to ask the NCAA executive council to
study how to implement rules related to academic performance--the
most dramatic of which would bar teams from postseason play if they
didn't live up to yet-to-be established standards.</TE>
<TE>   "The penalties we have in mind are quite severe," Kirwin said.
"It's probably several years down the road, but I genuinely believe
we will not turn back."</TE>
<TE>   In other action, the group approved new criteria for Division I-A
membership that will go into effect in 2004, including a requirement
that football teams must average at least 15,000 in attendance for
home games.</TE>
<TE>   Also approved, as expected, was emergency action allowing incoming
football players to participate in voluntary off-season workouts
conducted by strength and conditioning coaches--a reaction to safety
concerns after last year's rash of football deaths.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the moratorium on the number of postseason bowl games
was lifted, and football teams with 6-6 records will be eligible
after the 2002 season, with no decision made about future years.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeping changes in amateurism rules sought by outgoing NCAA
President Cedric Dempsey have fallen mostly by the wayside.</TE>
<TE>   A proposal to allow projected high draft picks to take out $20,000
loans was discussed and remains tabled indefinitely.</TE>

<LD>A good short game and some luck can save a golf score. Mark
Calcavecchia proved that Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Calcavecchia made three miraculous pars in the middle of his
round, then needed only 11 putts over his last 11 holes to shoot a
seven-under-par 65 for the first-day lead in the PGA's Greater
Greensboro Chrysler Classic in North Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   Calcavecchia's bogey-free round at Forest Oaks Country Club was

<HD>Blues Eliminate the Blackhawks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For St. Louis goalie Brent Johnson, the end of his long shutout
streak was no big deal.</LD>
<LD>   He allowed three goals in the second period but wore an ear-to-ear
grin after the Blues overcame a two-goal deficit to advance to the
second round of the playoffs with a 5-3 victory over the Chicago
Blackhawks in Game 5 on Thursday at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   "It's such a great feeling with these guys in this room," Johnson
said. "They never say die and they play with so much heart and so
much emotion."</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, in his first season as a starter, blanked the Blackhawks
in Games 2, 3 and 4, and he is one of only five goalies in NHL
history with three shutouts in a playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   After 3 hours 26 minutes 45 seconds without allowing a goal, he
gave up the three, the last two on consecutive shots, as the
Blackhawks took a 3-1 lead. After St. Louis rallied to tie the score,
Jamal Mayers' goal at 6:23 of the third was the difference.</TE>
<TE>   Mayers, who scored a career-best nine goals in 77 regular-season
games, broke the tie by whipping a turnaround shot from the right
circle that went between Chicago goalie Steve Passmore's pads. Ray
Ferraro set up the goal by kicking the puck to Mayers from behind the
net.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Tkachuk made it a two-goal lead, scoring with 4:04 to go.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Mellanby got his third goal of the series for the Blues.
Scott Young and Chris Pronger also scored, and Al MacInnis had two
assists for the Western Conference's fourth-seeded team.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 5, Montreal 2--Brian Rolston scored a short-handed goal in
the second period to help the Bruins even the series, 2-2, at
Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Boston's Kyle McLaren was assessed a five-minute match penalty
with 1:17 left in the third period when he flattened Richard Zednik,
who scored both Montreal goals, with an elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Zednik was motionless as he was treated on the ice for about five
minutes. He was removed on a stretcher and taken to a hospital with a
suspected concussion, fractured nose and broken jaw.</TE>
<TE>   Rolston, who had nine short-handed goals in the regular season,
picked off a soft pass at the blue line and beat Jose Theodore with a
shot between the pads at 15:46 of the second period to make it 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins took a 3-0 lead on goals from P.J. Stock, Bill Guerin
and Martin Lapointe. Zednik scored his first goal on a power play at
14:14 of the second.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Vancouver 0--Sergei Fedorov scored two first-period
goals and assisted on another as the Red Wings won their third
straight game in the series after losing the first two games at home.</TE>
<TE>   Just 4:02 into the game at Detroit, Fedorov put the Red Wings
ahead, 1-0, with a slap shot between the circles. Then the Red Wings
chased Dan Cloutier with two goals in a 1:57 span later in the
period.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Dominik Hasek, who made 25 saves, played his third
straight solid game.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd Devereaux's goal gave Detroit a 3-0 lead and sent Cloutier to
the bench after stopping just six of nine shots.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Once the Kings got Colorado into overtime, they knew that they had
the defending Stanley Cup champions right where they wanted them.</LD>
<LD>   Displaying the character that has been a trademark under Coach
Andy Murray, the short-handed Kings gutted one out Thursday night
with a 1-0 victory over the Avalanche in front of a standing-room
only crowd at Pepsi Center.</LD>
<LD>   Winger Craig Johnson will go down in the books as the player who
scored the winning goal of Game 5, but it was truly a team effort for
the Kings, who trail, 3-2, in the best-of-seven series. The teams
will meet again for Game 6 Saturday afternoon at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   "We're back against the wall and we're not going to go down
without a fight," said forward Bryan Smolinski. "We know what they
are throwing at us. It's not a big secret."</TE>
<TE>   With forwards Adam Deadmarsh and Cliff Ronning home with injuries,
the Kings lost another top-line player in the first period when
defenseman Philippe Boucher left the game because of an eye injury
after being hit by a puck.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of falling apart with so many key players down, the
Kings tightened their chin straps and gave it everything they had.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy [Murray] did a good job with the lines," Smolinski said. "He
got everybody into the game and rolled the lines a couple of times.
He got some key matchups that worked."</TE>
<TE>   In the playoffs, the Kings have won five overtime games in a row,
dating to last year's postseason run that included two overtime
victories over Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "We have lots of pride in our locker room and maybe they think
it's going to be easy," said defenseman Jaroslav Modry, who gave
Johnson the pass to set up his winning goal. "But every game is
different. We know that we will show up and battle as tough as we
can. We will play as hard as we can every single game, every single
shift. That's our motto. We've been doing it all year. We've been in
tight games since Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' season could easily be over today if not for the play
of goaltender Felix Potvin, who was at his best down the stretch,
finishing with 26 saves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of fun, especially when you're on the winning side,"
Potvin said. "It's not much fun on the other side. For us, it's do or
die. I give credit to that line that was on the ice for OT. They were
really buzzing and throwing pucks at the net and that's usually how
you win."</TE>
<TE>   Just as they did in the first four games of the series, the Kings
matched Colorado blow for blow.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that Colorado Coach Bob Hartley had the final line change
because the Avalanche was at home, Murray threw a few twists at him
with his lines.</TE>
<TE>   Murray started the game by having his players keep their time on
the ice short, and Colorado had trouble adjusting in the first
period. Without Deadmarsh, Murray opened with Jaroslav Bednar skating
with Jason Allison and Ziggy Palffy, but he didn't stick with that
trio.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Steve Heinze or Smolinski and sometimes even Ian
Laperriere skated on the Kings' No. 1 line.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a lot of players tonight, moving guys in and out,"
Murray said. "It was the players who really made the difference. It
was a game where the two goalies just battled so hard against each
other."</TE>
<TE>   In the first period, the Kings had a couple of promising scoring
chances, Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy was up to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Smolinski had his rebound attempt from the left circle stuffed by
Roy nearly six minutes into the game. About two minutes later,
Boucher had a blast stopped, followed by Palffy's back-hander from
the slot that was smacked away by the Avalanche goalie.</TE>
<TE>   In the second period, the Kings didn't get the same type of looks,
as Colorado's defense clamped down. After getting eight shots in the
first, the Kings had only one over the first 10 minutes of the second
and finished with only five in the period.</TE>
<TE>   While the King offense was a little stagnant, Colorado's attack
began to pick up steam. But what Roy did to the Kings in the first
period, Potvin did the same to the Avalanche in the second.
Colorado's Alex Tanguay, Steven Reinprecht and Joe Sakic each had
great chances to score.</TE>
<TE>   In an evenly played third period, the Kings seemed to gain more
confidence with each save made by Potvin, setting the stage for
Johnson's heroics in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of heart and our team plays hard," Johnson said.
"But the key was the play of Felix. He was outstanding tonight. He
played an unbelievable game and he kept us in."</TE>

<LD>Toronto Maple Leafs' captain and leading scorer Mats Sundin will sit

<LD>   The Leafs won the first two games of the best-of-seven series, but

<HD>It's a Far Cry From Normal for Maddux</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greg Maddux was standing at his locker, trying to figure out the
worst game of his career, when teammate Vinny Castilla walked by with
a bawling child.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no crying in baseball," someone said, trying to lighten
the mood.</LD>
<LD>   "Too bad," Maddux replied, not even cracking a smile.</LD>
<TE>   The four-time Cy Young Award winner surrendered a career-high 10
runs in 42/3 innings, and the Arizona Diamondbacks routed the Atlanta
Braves, 11-5, Thursday night at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "I embarrassed my team, my manager and myself," said Maddux, whose
ERA went from 0.75 to 3.78. "I've got to figure it out, so it doesn't
happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Damian Miller drove in four runs as the Diamondbacks took two of
three from the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux (2-1), bothered this season by a sore back, was knocked out
during a horrendous fifth. He gave up eight runs--a career high for
an inning--and walked four, tying his high.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the walks were intentional and a crucial error by Wes Helms
made four of the runs unearned. Still, that didn't ease the sting for
Maddux, who had never given up more than eight runs.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't forget this--never," Maddux said. "If I forget this,
I'm stupid."</TE>
<TE>   In all, Maddux walked five and hit a batter. Most stunning of all,
he threw more balls (52) than strikes (48).</TE>
<TE>   Hardly the kind of performance one would expect from one of
baseball's best control pitchers. Last year, Maddux set an NL record
by going 721/3 innings without a walk.</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, St. Louis 6--Pinch-hitter Mark Johnson hit a
tie-breaking home run against Dave Veres (2-2) in the eighth at New
York--the Mets' first homer in 301 at-bats since April 15.</TE>
<TE>   New York scored five runs in the fifth to rally from a 5-1 deficit
and take two of three from St. Louis, which lost for the ninth time
in 11 games.</TE>

<HD>Still No Place Like Home for Lieber</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Cub right-hander improves to 14-0 in last 15
starts at Wrigley Field by defeating Giants, 2-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Jon Lieber doesn't care which way the wind blows at Wrigley Field.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago Cubs won their 15th consecutive Wrigley Field game
started by Lieber, defeating the San Francisco Giants, 2-1, Thursday
as Sammy Sosa homered and Delino DeShields had the go-ahead RBI.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no idea what it is. And whatever it is, and I don't even
want to think about it," Lieber said.</LD>
<TE>   He is 14-0 in his last 15 starts at home, and the Cubs won the
other game too. In his first appearance since missing a scheduled
start on April 20 because of elbow soreness, he gave up one run and
six hits in eight innings and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   Lieber (3-0) hasn't lost at home since he was defeated by
Arizona's Randy Johnson last May 18. Lieber is 25-16 in 60 career
appearances at Wrigley.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I came here to pitch, I've enjoyed it," Lieber said.</TE>
<TE>   When the game started, the wind was blowing out to right at gusts
up to 36 mph, making right field very inviting for left-handed
batters.</TE>
<TE>   But Lieber, a right-hander, was successful against Barry Bonds,
who went 0 for 4 after sitting Wednesday night to rest his sore left
hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds made out on Lieber's first pitch in each of his first three
at-bats, before finding some patience and looking at four pitches his
last time up in the eighth. Lieber still struck him out.</TE>
<TE>   "Lieber has been beating me since Pittsburgh," said Bonds, who is
five for 36 (.139) against Lieber. "He's been giving me trouble since
way back. Certain pitchers can just get you, and Lieber has been one
of those guys."</TE>
<TE>   Lieber had to be good because Livan Hernandez (4-1) gave up only
seven hits in his second complete game this season. Antonio Alfonseca
earned his fourth save.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa homered in the fourth inning, his eighth homer of the season
and fifth in his career against Hernandez. Sosa has a .385 career
batting average (15-for-39) against the right-hander.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs won two of three from the Giants, giving Chicago (8-12)
its first series win of the season.</TE>

<HD>Skate Reforms to Be Proposed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Figure Skating Assn., saying it feels compelled to "redeem
the reputation of this great sport" in the wake of the Salt Lake City
judging controversy, said Thursday it will propose a three-pronged
reform initiative at the International Skating Union Congress in
Japan in early June.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, as announced by USFSA President Phyllis Howard,
would address the current judging system, the selection of
international judges and the sanctioning of judges.</LD>
<LD>   "We must institute these reforms now to ensure a level playing
field to all the talented, young skaters who devote their lives to
skating excellence and the dream of a championship medal," she said.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal suggests determining skaters' placements by the
median mark because it "represents the statistical consensus among
the judges and puts the greatest weight where the experts
collectively agree," Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   It also recommends appointing a committee to determine the
distribution of judges to avoid a geographic bias, and recommends
that any judge or federation official who is guilty of an ethical
violation should be permanently banned from judging or officiating.</TE>
<TE>   Judging became a hot topic at the Olympics, when French judge
Marie-Reine Le Gougne said she had been pressured by her federation
to vote against her conscience in the pairs competition. She was
suspended by the ISU, and Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier
were declared co-gold medalists with Russians Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze. Le Gougne faces a hearing Monday and Tuesday at
ISU headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.</TE>

<HD>Disappointed Son Doesn't Rise in Ojai</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Brett Van Linge, hoping to join his father as a
champion, instead is eliminated, 6-2, 6-2, by Venice's Melnick in the
first round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like father, like son?</LD>
<LD>   Brett Van Linge wished.</LD>
<LD>   Trying to continue a family tradition of tennis success, Brett Van
Linge, an Irvine Woodbridge High senior, lost Thursday in the first
round of the CIF interscholastic singles division of the 102nd Ojai
tournament.</LD>
<TE>   The 6-2, 6-2 loss to Jeff Melnick of Venice ended Van Linge's
effort to become an Ojai champion like his father, Jerry, who won
doubles titles in the men's open invitational division in 1977, '79,
'80 and '81.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to see myself do that," Brett said, shaking his head at
his father's achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that I had to play well to win and it was just a bad day.
But you're gonna have days like that."</TE>
<TE>   Brett, the No. 1 player on Woodbridge's team, has had more of
those days than his dad did at Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   Brett lost in the second round last year, and he was hoping to get
at least that far this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating," he said, "but it's a tough tournament."</TE>
<TE>   His father understands stiff competition. Besides the four doubles
titles he won with two partners, he also lost in the men's open
singles final in 1980 to Pasadena resident Tom Leonard, with whom
Jerry teamed to win his last three Ojai doubles titles.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to [play] right here," Jerry said as he watched Brett
complete his match at Thacher School. "It brings back the memories."</TE>
<TE>   They are mostly good ones for Jerry, if not Brett, who said, "I
had a really slow start and never really got a rhythm going today."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he did, but it was all wrong. He was broken twice in the
first three games and trailed, 0-4, before finally taking a game off
Melnick.</TE>
<TE>   "When that happened, I pretty much looked forward to finishing the
set and hoped the second one would be better," Brett said. "It's hard
to see that, but I'll try to learn from this and then put it behind
me."</TE>
<TE>   The match was difficult for Jerry Van Linge to watch. "[Brett's]
fighting himself right now, not this guy," he said. "He can hit all
the shots, although today you wouldn't know it."</TE>
<TE>   In high school competition this season, Brett is 48-6 in sets. His
losses have been primarily to higher-ranked opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between him and those guys is a couple points,"
Woodbridge Coach Ric Barth said. "He's got to pick his spots, and
he's got to be able to win the big points more consistently."</TE>
<TE>   Brett has eschewed most junior tournaments this year in favor of
working out on his own and with his father, who is his primary coach.</TE>
<TE>   With Brett leading the way, Woodbridge (14-5, 7-0), ranked No. 9
in The Times' poll, is closing in on its third consecutive Sea View
League title. The Warriors were runners-up to Irvine University in
the Southern Section Division II playoffs last season.</TE>
<TE>   Brett, who will attend Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on a tennis
scholarship next season, and Jerry, who still teams with Leonard to
form one of the top men's 45 and men's 50 age-group doubles teams in
Southern California, often join forces in father-son tournaments. The
Van Linges advanced to the round of 16 in last year's USTA Father-Son
National Championships.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to get any better, but as he improves, our team
gets better," Jerry said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Today is moving day. Thousands will be heading north on U.S. 395 to
take part in Saturday's Eastern Sierra general trout-fishing opener,
and the California Highway Patrol will be out in force.</LD>
<LD>   It'll be no picnic for those in the black-and-whites. Their motto
is, "We don't need the business," said Sgt. Gary Parrott of the
Bishop office, but they're aware that business will be brisk today.</LD>
<LD>   The day before a trout opener is unlike any other. The vehicles
come in all shapes and sizes, and travel at speeds ranging from
dreadfully slow to exceedingly fast, which is a potentially deadly
mix.</LD>
<TE>   "If they're all traveling fast, that's not necessarily a bad
thing," Parrott says. "But when you have fast vehicles suddenly
coming up on very slow vehicles, the results can be ugly."</TE>
<TE>   He referred particularly to "weekend warriors" in old, overloaded
recreational vehicles that have a particularly tough time making the
uphill climb into the high country.</TE>
<TE>   Parrott asks drivers of these vehicles to use their flashers as a
warning to others while creeping up steeper inclines such as Sherwin
Grade. He says citations will be issued to those failing to pull over
when five or more vehicles are backed up behind them, just as they'll
be issued to those traveling at exceedingly high speeds.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate the importance of driving responsibly, Parrott
points to five accident-related deaths on Eastern Sierra highways so
far this year. Fatal accidents typically occur when one vehicle
drifts into oncoming traffic, but also during unsafe passing
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing too many of these grinders, where people get
impatient and try to pass a mile-long string of cars and ... wham!"
Parrott says. "People aren't aware that there are dips in the highway
deep enough to hide a Mack truck. You'll think it's clear and start
passing, only to have one of these trucks appear right in front of
you."</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, construction crews have been busy--especially
in problem areas--working toward the ultimate goal of providing a
divided thoroughfare with two lanes drivable in either direction,
which will eliminate the head-on collisions for which U.S. 395 has
become notorious.</TE>
<TE>   "Only when that's completed will I be truly relieved," Parrott
says.</TE>
<TE>   Scorched-Earth Policy</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has posted
no-vehicle-access signs around a five-mile portion of the Owens River
seared by a fire last month.</TE>
<TE>   The river's banks, made accessible by the fire, are sure to be
attractive to fishermen, but they are being asked to keep their
vehicles on existing roads and to tread carefully to enable a
speedier recovery of riparian habitat.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire was never determined, but suspicions remain
that it was set intentionally to provide foot access.</TE>
<TE>   Those witnessing suspicious activities on the Owens River are
asked to call the DWP at (760) 872-1104, or the Inyo County Sheriff's
Department at (760) 873-7887.</TE>
<TE>   On Thin Ice</TE>
<TE>   If you intend to ice fish, you'll basically be risking death. This
is the assessment of authorities throughout Inyo and Mono counties,
who credit unseasonably warm weather recently with creating dangerous
conditions at the usual opening-weekend ice-fishing lakes.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Paranick, director of emergency services for the Mono
County Sheriff's Department, warns, "The life expectancy when falling
through the ice is sure death unless someone can pull you out or they
can pull themselves out, which is highly unlikely."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most popular ice-fishing destinations is South Lake, at
9,800 feet atop Bishop Creek Canyon. "I have bad concerns,"
concessionaire Gary Olson said. "The inlet is open water and the
pools by the springs area in Boiler Cove are showing. There is a lot
of water beginning to show around the edges and [Southern California
Edison] is beginning to raise the level of the water. It is rising
slowly, but this will cause the ice to crack."</TE>
<TE>   With any luck, Edison and Mother Nature will have combined to
eliminate the desire someone might have to try to walk on water.
Nearby Lake Sabrina is free of ice and North Lake is mostly open
water. Twin Lakes in the Mammoth basin has mostly open water and Lake
Mary above Twin is breaking up.</TE>
<TE>   Local Freshwater</TE>
<TE>   * Concessionaires at Orange County's paid-admission lakes are
using various means of luring anglers away from the Eastern Sierra.
Irvine Lake, for example, has stocked 10,000 pounds of rainbow and
steelhead trout, and is giving stuffed tackle boxes to the first 125
kids Saturday and Sunday. Nearby Santa Ana River Lakes has gone
strictly big fish, stocking 4,000 pounds of trophy-size trout for its
annual Sierra Grand Opener, which began Thursday. Corona Lake in
Riverside County also has a Sierra Grand event in progress.</TE>
<TE>   * Catch of the week: It weighed only 3.7 pounds, but by red-ear
sunfish standards, that's a monster. San Diego's Phou Aphaivong
reeled in the big perch from San Vicente, a San Diego city-run lake.
The catch is a county record.</TE>
<TE>   Local Saltwater</TE>
<TE>   * The focus for many this weekend will be on halibut. Going up
against the Eastern Sierra opener is Saturday and Sunday's Santa
Monica Bay Halibut Derby, with the top prize a two-week fishing and
sightseeing expedition in South Africa. Cost is $50. Details: (310)
450-6556.... A charity tournament benefiting the 976-TUNA youth
fishing program is scheduled May 4, with boundaries from Point Fermin
on the Palos Verdes Peninsula to Huntington Pier. The weigh station
is Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach. Cost is $35 per person. Details:
(562) 435-4093, or www.sycoflb.com or www.976tuna.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Catch of the week: This week's whopper required a trip all the
way to Clipperton Island off Costa Rica. It's a 268-pound yellowfin
tuna landed by Charlie McGhee of Encinitas during a long-range trip
aboard the Red Rooster III out of San Diego. The boats are still
fishing Clipperton because Mexico's Revillagigedo Islands remain
under a government closure.</TE>
<TE>   Wave of the Future</TE>
<TE>   There's a new surfing tour in town. The Foster's Pro Surfing Tour
kicked off this week at Lower Trestles south of San Clemente with the
Foster's Cup, a two-star Assn. of Surfing Professionals World
Qualifying Series event and the first stop on the inaugural Foster's
tour.</TE>
<TE>   The spectator-friendly event continues through Saturday and
involves some of surfing's best. Among the top names in the lineup:
reigning ASP world champion C.J. Hobgood of Satellite Beach, Fla.;
2002 champion Sunny Garcia of Kauai, Hawaii; and a slew of local
surfers ranging in expertise from world class--Pat O'Connell, Taylor
Knox, Mike Parsons, etc.--to up and coming.</TE>
<TE>   Day of the Seal</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Mammal Care Center at Fort MacArthur in San Pedro is
holding its annual International Day of the Seal fund-raiser and open
house Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   It will be an eye-opening experience for many as the staff and
volunteers have their hands full with dozens of sick animals, mostly
sea lions suffering from domoic acid poisoning, a natural event
caused by toxic algae blooms that occur to some extent annually in
offshore waters.</TE>
<TE>   The event will feature narrated lectures of the work that goes on,
as well as information booths, activities for kids and a fund-raising
raffle. Admission is free but donations will be accepted. Details:
(310) 548-5677 or www.mar3ine.org.</TE>
<TE>   A Day for the Dogs</TE>
<TE>   Rattlesnakes are out early this year, so the timing of this
weekend's San Gabriel Valley Chapter of Quail Unlimited's annual
Snake Avoidance Clinic for Dogs is perfect. It's Saturday and Sunday
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Sierra Vista Dog Park in Sierra Madre.
Cost is $55 per dog. Details: (626) 355-3832.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   The catch last weekend of an 815-pound tiger shark off Australia's
eastern shore was both impressive and startling. In its stomach was a
human skull, arm and pelvis. Police on Wednesday said the bones
belonged to a 52-year-old Sydney resident who was washed into the sea
while fishing from rocks on April 2.</TE>

Trail Blazers covered their locker room grease board with white
towels before Thursday's playoff game.</LD>
<LD>   They were fearful of members of the media seeing and stealing
their plays. It is a fear as common in the hieroglyphic-schemed NBA
as a fear of baggy shorts and slam dunks.</LD>
<LD>   Call it Ink-Stained-Wretchaphobia.</LD>
<TE>   A bit later, in the Lakers' eventual 103-96 victory in Game 2 at
Staples Center, we learned what the Trail Blazers were hiding.</TE>
<TE>   And now, rest assured, we understand why.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers didn't want anybody to see the play where a
barking Dale Davis kicks a basketball toward the stands and then
stalks off barebacked like the dog that he is.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers didn't want anybody to see the play where Ruben
Patterson throws Derek Fisher to the ground, then bounces the ball to
the rafters when called for a foul.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers didn't want anyone to see how their complicated
attack calls for Scottie Pippen sitting on the floor and pouting, or
Rasheed Wallace jumping at the official and cursing.</TE>
<TE>   If we had seen the grease board, we might have seen the blueprints
for the airballs, the bad alley-oops, the quick misses, the lost
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, under the circumstances that have lifted the Lakers to a
two-games-to-none advantage, there was only thing wrong with the
white towels.</TE>
<TE>   There should have been more of them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to compose myself," said Trail Blazer Coach Maurice
Cheeks afterward, rubbing his forehead.</TE>
<TE>   He later admitted, "Yeah, we lost a little composure. It was a
little disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   And so unfortunate.</TE>
<TE>   Despite closing the gap to six points late in the game against the
bored Lakers, the Trail Blazers were generally so lousy, it obscured
the fact the Lakers were pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   Those who measure such things will agree that after a sluggish
opening game, the Laker playoff run officially began with two-tenths
of a second remaining in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, faced with an open last-second shot that he takes
every single time in the regular season, instead passed the ball to
Rick Fox in the corner.</TE>
<TE>   Fox made a three-point shot at the buzzer, then leaped and pointed
at Bryant in surprised and sincere gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant getting everyone involved, Fox making his shots, the Lakers
grabbing momentum as a clock hits 0:00?</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, it's spring sweeps at The Lake Show.</TE>
<TE>   If only there was more drama.</TE>
<TE>   If only the Trail Blazers didn't resemble a Bob Saget sitcom.</TE>
<TE>   I never thought I'd write these four words, but here goes:</TE>
<TE>   I miss Arvydas Sabonis.</TE>
<TE>   I miss the Trail Blazers of a couple of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   I miss those teams that could actually compete consistently in
these big games against the Lakers, making them fun, making them
worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "We got caught up in the game too much," said Portland guard Derek
Anderson. "We need to channel our emotions in the right way."</TE>
<TE>   You think?</TE>
<TE>   What has happened to this once-great rivalry was most evident with
8:19 remaining Thursday, when Robert Horry blocked a silly Wallace
runner, knocking the ball to Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant flew downcourt past Anderson while Anderson was complaining
to the referee.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant then flipped it to Shaquille O'Neal, who hit a flying
left-handed dunk over Pippen followed by a six-step monster stalk in
front of the Laker bench.</TE>
<TE>   Remind you of anything?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, O'Neal's celebrated monster stalk after his alley-oop
dunk against the Trail Blazers in the celebrated Game 7 victory in
the 2000 Western Conference finals did not seem like that many steps.</TE>
<TE>   But the point was made.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers haven't been the same since blowing a 15-point
lead in the fourth quarter of that game.</TE>
<TE>   Since that game, the Lakers have won five consecutive playoff
games against the Trail Blazers, with the losers never coming closer
than seven points.</TE>
<TE>   Hard to believe that Pippen is considered a championship player.
Not in playoffs against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   He simply cannot focus against his former mentor and current
antagonist Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Hard to believe, also, that Wallace is one of the league's best
power forwards. In this sort of games, he's more of a circus
sideshow.</TE>
<TE>   Hard to believe that this Trail Blazer team won 12 consecutive
games this season and actually beat the Lakers earlier this month in
Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Once again in the playoffs, when these dysfunctional folks are not
covering up their boneheaded strategy with white towels, they are
waving them.</TE>

<LD>Bill Gibbs appears to have the fastest boat in the Tommy Bahama
Newport to Ensenada Yacht Race, but he doesn't think he can beat the
record. He just hopes he can beat the curse.</LD>
<LD>   "If we finish I'll be happy," the Ventura sailor said. "If we do
better than finish, I'll be ecstatic."</LD>
<LD>   The 55th edition of the world's largest international sailboat
race, renamed for its first title sponsor, is scheduled to send off
the first of about 450 boats at noon today from a split starting line
set just outside the Newport Harbor jetty.</LD>
<TE>   Gibbs and five friends will be sailing the largest multihull, his
52-foot catamaran, Afterburner.</TE>
<TE>   Multihulls, which don't need keels for stability, are inherently
faster than heavily ballasted monohulls. That's why the multihull
record for the 125-nautical-mile race, 6 hours 46 minutes 40 seconds
by Steve Fossett sailing the 60-foot Stars &amp; Stripes catamaran in
1998, is five hours faster than the monohull record of 11 hours 54
minutes by Roy E. Disney's 73-foot Pyewacket in that same
extraordinarily windy race.</TE>
<TE>   Fossett was the first ever to finish before sundown; Disney's was
the first monohull ever to finish before midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Gibbs, 47, didn't finish at all. "That was our very
first race with the boat," he said. "We went right out and broke the
mast, about 9 o'clock at night. ... We were way in front of
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs isn't sure his boat is exorcised of the demons it may have
brought with it from New Zealand, where he bought it 16 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The previous owner had bad luck," he said. "The big race in New
Zealand is similar to the Ensenada race in length. He must have raced
it from '87 to '99 and won less than half the time. The joke was that
he won every time he finished."</TE>

<LD>There was no popping of champagne corks, no dumping of Gatorade on
someone's head, not even any high-fives.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, few would have predicted the Southern Section, made up
of 529 schools, would vote overwhelmingly to make athletes who
transfer without moving ineligible to compete at the varsity level
for one year.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday in Long Beach, the vote to impose transfer
restrictions beginning with the 2003-04 school year was anticlimactic
because support had grown like a tidal wave, uniting private and
public schools, athletic powers and weaklings.</LD>
<TE>   Something changed. Call it outrage at the repeated, blatant
attempts by parents and coaches to manipulate rules in the hope of
winning.</TE>
<TE>   Every school has been affected by transfers. Every principal has a
story to tell. Every coach has an experience to relate.</TE>
<TE>   It was time to return high school sports to its roots, where
athletes are supposed to compete on a level playing field, learn
life's lessons and may the best team win.</TE>
<TE>   "It reached critical mass," said Gary Murphy, principal at West
Hills Chaminade and one of the strongest supporters of transfer
restrictions. "Everybody has been affected, where they've lost kids
and gotten kids and didn't know what to do with them. It's dawning on
people that nobody's going to rescue us, and we have to do it
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, when the state Legislature passed the open-enrollment
law to give parents the option of choosing schools outside their
neighborhood, many high school programs have engaged in a game of
brinkmanship.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches and administrators have forgotten lessons about loyalty
once taught by their parents and grandparents in favor of enrolling
any teenager who walks in off the street and can run, jump or hit and
help the team win immediately.</TE>
<TE>   The examples of unworthy athletic exuberance helped generate an
overflow of outrage.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Mission Hills Alemany hired a club basketball coach,
Darryl McDonald, to coach its boys' team. Three former club players
attending nearby San Fernando transferred to Alemany, which went from
0-12 in league play the previous season to co-champion.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, running back De'Andre Scott of Alemany was tired of
losing, so in the middle of the season, he transferred to Santa Fe
Springs St. Paul. In his second game with St. Paul, he rushed for 115
yards and scored three touchdowns against Alemany, the school he had
attended for three years when its football team went from winning to
losing.</TE>
<TE>   This winter, basketball player Mustafa Asghari of Woodland Hills
Taft was removed from the team by his coach for not following
instructions. He changed residences, enrolled at Van Nuys Birmingham
and played in seven league games, twice facing his former teammates.
After the season, Asghari tried to re-enroll at Taft with another
address change so he could graduate with his friends, but the school
refused to take him back.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would allow Asghari to play immediately if he had to
do it over again, Birmingham Coach Al Bennett declined to answer. But
Bennett promised a new philosophy starting next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care if I win a game," he said. "I'm going to keep only
the kids I can coach and that I can develop into a real team."</TE>
<TE>   This month, Kevin Fitzpatrick, a junior third baseman at Woodland
Hills El Camino Real, was stuck on the bench. He had only one at-bat
when he quit the team and transferred to Reseda Cleveland, which was
0-3 in league play.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzpatrick was put in Cleveland's starting lineup. He had a
double on Monday in an upset of defending City champion Chatsworth.
The player he replaced, sophomore third baseman Chris Honeycutt, had
spent all summer, fall and spring working hard in the Cleveland
program, only to lose his spot.</TE>
<TE>   None of the transfers broke any rules, but were they appropriate
and were the decisions by the coaches to play the transfer students
ethically correct?</TE>
<TE>   These are difficult, unresolved issues faced season after season
because the number of transfers has reached record proportions.</TE>
<TE>   The action taken by the Southern Section will discourage many from
transferring, but not all. Parents with the financial resources can
simply move and make their children eligible immediately. Others
could find "redshirting" a year on junior varsity not so bad.</TE>
<TE>   Hardship waivers will be available, but Southern Section
Commissioner Jim Staunton warned that he'll approve only legitimate
hardships that are "unforeseeable, unavoidable, uncorrectable acts."</TE>
<TE>   The City Section has scheduled a vote for March 2003 to decide
whether to approve similar transfer restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, parents can always go to court and challenge the
constitutionality of requiring their child to sit out one year of
varsity competition for transferring without relocating.</TE>
<TE>   But those on the front line don't seem to care. Only 11 league
representatives out of more than 70 voted against the proposal. The
landslide vote Thursday shows that people have decided to take a
stand. They're fed up with individuals trying to disrupt the system.</TE>
<TE>   "You can still choose your school," Murphy said. "Just do it
before ninth grade. Maybe they'll take a little more time and effort
in finding out what program they want. It will stabilize programs. It
will make teams feel more secure. We're going to stick our necks out
and if it hurts, it's still the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   For doing the right thing in Long Beach, those brave athletic
administrators deserve to celebrate. They've sent a message to the
rest of the state: Enough is enough.</TE>

<HD>Southern Section OKs Curb on Athletic Transfers</HD>
<DH>Meetings: Council approves proposal that will prohibit
students who change schools without moving from participating in
varsity sports for one year, starting in 2003-04.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Southern Section council on Thursday approved one momentous
transfer proposal and paved the way for another that collectively
could place a stranglehold on transfers for athletic purposes.</LD>
<LD>   The section council, meeting in Long Beach, overwhelmingly adopted
a proposal that will prohibit students who transfer without moving
from participating in varsity sports for one year, beginning with the
2003-04 school year. Students who transfer will be eligible to
compete at levels below varsity or in sports they haven't previously
played in high school.</LD>
<LD>   The council also instructed its representatives on the California
Interscholastic Federation's federated council to vote in favor of a
state proposal that would require school officials to certify that no
one connected with their booster clubs or athletic programs had
contact with transfers. The state proposal, which would go into
effect on a two-year trial basis starting with the 2002-03 school
year, faces a vote May 3.</LD>
<TE>   Southern Section Commissioner Jim Staunton said the section's
proposal should eradicate powerhouse athletic programs built by an
influx of out-of-district transfers who utilized open enrollment, the
state law that allows parents to choose what school their children
attend.</TE>
<TE>   "Principals said they would like to get back to one community
pitting their kids against another community and saying, 'We can beat
you,'" Staunton said.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Murphy, the Santa Ana Mater Dei High principal who represents
the Serra League, was one of 11 council members who voted against the
restrictions on open-enrollment transfers. Murphy said a majority of
the principals in his four-team league believed that "the options of
parents were being taken away under the new rule."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said the perception that Mater Dei's teams are stacked with
transfers is unfounded. Under open enrollment, Murphy said, three
times as many athletes have transferred out of Mater Dei as have
transferred in, mainly because of tuition costs.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy also voted against the statewide proposal, which would
require principals to sign a pre-enrollment contact form, because he
said it would put them on the line for things they "realistically
have no control over," such as contact by boosters.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the definition of a booster?" Murphy asked. "For example,
parents are at a cocktail party and so-and-so says, 'I know your son
goes to XYZ Catholic school and it's a wonderful school.' Then that
kid ends up transferring. Is that contact or not?"</TE>
<TE>   Staunton said Murphy was being overly cautious.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality will be that [principals will] have a pretty good
handle on it, and if they have any questions they can call us and
we'll advise them on it," he said. "We don't want to be out there
declaring teams ineligible willy-nilly because a parent talked to a
student when he was in second grade."</TE>
<TE>   Staunton acknowledged that the transfer restrictions could have
unfortunate consequences, such as a dramatic rise in the number of
frivolous hardship waiver appeals. That's why he is proposing to
strengthen the wording on hardship forms to indicate that they are
acceptable only under an "unforeseeable, unavoidable, uncorrectable
act, condition or event that is non-athletic in nature."</TE>
<TE>   Staunton is considering the implementation of a $75 administrative
fee to defray the costs of hearings to handle hardship appeals. The
fee would be paid by the school a prospective athlete hoped to attend
and would be reimbursed if the athlete won his or her appeal.</TE>

<LD>If there's one thing that made professional football this country's
No. 1 sport, it was television. Football is ideally suited for
television, and technological advances such as instant replay and
slow-motion helped propel it past baseball and everything else.</LD>
<LD>   The same thing is now happening with stock car racing. The sport
is in high gear, and television, with its in-car cameras, two-way
radio contact with drivers and such audio features as "Crank It Up,"
is helping push it into the No. 2 position.</LD>
<LD>   The NASCAR race on Fox from Talladega, Ala., Sunday drew a 7.0
national rating and blew away the NBA playoffs on NBC. The NBA games
going head-to-head against the race averaged a 4.0 rating, and the
national rating for Portland and the Lakers was a 5.9.</LD>
<TE>   The 7.0 for the Talladega race made it the third highest-rated
program of any kind for the week among male viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Even the NASCAR Busch Grand National races on Saturdays are
drawing big numbers. Fox's 2.5 average rating has made that series
the second most popular in motor sports behind the Winston Cup
series.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is primed for another big NASCAR weekend from California
Speedway in Fontana, highlighted by Sunday's Winston Cup NAPA Auto
Parts 500.</TE>
<TE>   On April 7, Fox's NASCAR coverage from the Texas Motor Speedway
drew a 3.3 national rating, the second highest of the weekend, behind
only a 3.5 for BellSouth golf. That may not appear to be that
impressive, but the race that day was postponed by rain. NASCAR fans
tuned in for the fill programming.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was a version of 'Survivor' for sports fans, NASCAR fans
would win for being the most loyal," said Chris Myers, the host of
Fox's pre-race shows.</TE>
<TE>   Myers was like most typical sports fans when he drew his NASCAR
assignment after Fox got involved two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "NASCAR was pretty far down on my list," he said. "I followed the
more traditional sports--football, baseball and basketball. But after
being exposed to it and the people in it, I'm a big NASCAR fan. There
is no spoiled bratty athlete syndrome in NASCAR."</TE>
<TE>   The Right Move</TE>
<TE>   David Hill, the chairman of Fox Sports, pushed hard for his
network to get involved with NASCAR, prompting Fox and FX to make an
eight-year, $1.6-billion deal with NASCAR before the 2001 season. NBC
and TNT chipped in with $1.2 billion over six years.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of doubting Thomases within our organization,"
Hill said. "It's always nice when your bet pays off in spades."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the first of the Fox-FX/NBC-TNT era, ratings zoomed up
36%, and they've held steady this year.</TE>
<TE>   Before the new television deal, NASCAR was all over the place,
with CBS, TNN, ESPN, ABC and TBS all involved. And most races were on
cable.</TE>
<TE>   Now the television coverage has been consolidated and for the most
part is on network television. Another plus for viewers is that News
Corp., Fox's parent company, acquired Speedvision in a $750-million
deal and relaunched it in February as Speed Channel, with a heavy
emphasis on NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   Speed Channel supplements the NASCAR coverage on network
television.</TE>
<TE>   The new television deal as a whole has NASCAR officials doing
cartwheels--or maybe in this case spinning doughnuts.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the many benefits of consolidating our television coverage
is the continuity it provides," said Paul Brooks, NASCAR's vice
president of broadcasting who works out of the organization's Los
Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of things along the way that really changed
the sport for the better and helped make it grow, and certainly
that's one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Fox this week won 11 Emmy Awards, topping all other networks. ESPN
finished second with six. Three of Fox's Emmys, including the one for
best live sports series, were for its NASCAR coverage. Fox's remote
NASCAR technical team won an Emmy, and the network also won for its
NASCAR graphics.</TE>
<TE>   A Star Is Born</TE>
<TE>   One of Fox's first moves when it got the NFL in 1993 was to hire
John Madden. One of Fox's first moves with NASCAR was to hire Darrell
Waltrip as its lead commentator.</TE>
<TE>   Waltrip does not fit the mold of a slick, smooth-talking
broadcaster. But in the world of NASCAR, "DW," as Waltrip is known,
is king. He's sort of to NASCAR what Terry Bradshaw is to the NFL--a
former champion with a winning personality. His down-home style fits
like a valve in a well-tuned engine.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is so high on Waltrip it has rewarded him with a new
four-year, $4-million contract, which puts him in a league with the
top-paid commentators in sports.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about NASCAR's popularity this week, Waltrip said, "They
have a lot to sell and have done a great job of selling it."</TE>
<TE>   As for television's role, he said, "We go places no one else goes
in sports."</TE>
<TE>   Controversy Brewing</TE>
<TE>   The condensed baseball Web casts on MLB.com apparently are going
over big with fans, getting about 650,000 hits a day. But they're not
going over big with executives at Fox and ESPN. The Web casts, they
claim, are infringing on their deals with Major League Baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "I've made no bones about it in conversations with baseball,"
Fox's Hill said. "We're unhappy with what they are doing. They are
undermining our telecasts. They claim they're bringing viewers to our
telecasts, but I don't buy that."</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   A plus for horse racing fans is the new two-hour race day show
from Hollywood Park on Fox Sports Net 2, "Trackside Live." The
TVG-produced show, usually on from 3-5 p.m., will be on tonight from
7-9 p.m. and Sunday's show will be four hours, 1:30-5:30 p.m.... With
Marv Albert still out because of injuries suffered in a limousine
accident last week, Paul Sunderland has drawn an NBC play-by-play
assignment this weekend. He'll work Saturday's Sacramento-Utah game
with P.J. Carlesimo.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   A surprise caller to Jim Rome's radio show Thursday was Albert
Belle, who vehemently denied what Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel
claimed in his book--that Belle used a corked bat. Belle also took a
few shots at Vizquel.... Paul Lo Duca now has his own weekly show,
"Behind the Mask," that airs Fridays at 5:10 p.m. on KXTA (1150)....
Doug Krikorian and Joe McDonnell broke the news on their
"McDonnell-Douglas" show on KSPN (1110) Thursday about Dan Guerrero
being the new athletic director at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Talk radio can sometimes be hazardous. Times columnist J.A.
Adande, a guest on "McDonnell-Douglas" Monday, was talking by cell
phone while stuck in traffic on the 10 Freeway when he got
rear-ended. "The natural thing to do in that case is curse, but
fortunately I didn't," Adande said.</TE>

<HD>UC Irvine's Guerrero Is Easy Choice for UCLA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Choosing among three comparable finalists for athletic director, UCLA
took the path of least resistance Thursday, hiring upbeat, outgoing
Dan Guerrero, a former Bruin baseball player who in the last 10 years
elevated UC Irvine into a thriving sports school.</LD>
<LD>   Guerrero, 50, will be introduced at a news conference today and
take over July 1 for Pete Dalis, who is retiring after 19 years in
the position.</LD>
<LD>   The other finalists, Boise State Athletic Director Gene Bleymaier
and UCLA associate athletic director Betsy Stephenson, had vocal
advocates and opponents in the athletic department and on a search
committee headed by vice chancellor Pete Blackman.</LD>
<TE>   Bleymaier, a former UCLA tight end, is a friend of Dalis and has
close ties to the Bruin football program. Stephenson, Dalis' top
assistant, was a favorite of those associated with the non-revenue
sports she supervised the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, in contrast, is relatively unknown to many UCLA insiders
and coaches despite his alumni status.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody who knows him says they like him, but around here, not
many people know him," said a Bruin administrator who declined to be
identified. "That worked in his favor because there were strong
feelings about [the other finalists], and Guerrero was below the
radar in terms of department politics."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say Guerrero can't play hardball. He was a second
baseman at UCLA who batted .343 from 1970-73 and still has a strong
arm, as Irvine Chancellor Ralph Cicerone discovered before tossing
the honorary first pitch at the Anteaters' baseball home opener in
January.</TE>
<TE>   "We played catch bare-handed to warm up my arm and the next day my
hand was bruised and swollen," Cicerone said.</TE>
<TE>   The chests of both administrators were puffed with pride because
the game marked the return of baseball at Irvine after a 10-year
absence. The tireless Guerrero was key to resurrecting the sport,
convincing a notoriously uninterested Irvine student body to pass a
referendum in 1999 that adds $33 to registration fees each quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The money has helped fuel $38 million of newly constructed and
renovated facilities in the last four years. Similar facilities
upgrades would be welcome at UCLA, a topic Guerrero undoubtedly
discussed with Blackman and UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale during
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Blackman, a 62-year-old former Bruin basketball player, wants to
see 37-year-old Pauley Pavilion renovated before he retires. The
project is in the discussion stage, and it will be incumbent on
Guerrero to move it forward.</TE>
<TE>   A $14-million renovation of the on-campus Acosta Training Center
is set to take place over the next two years. Some at UCLA whisper
that Guerrero could make a bold move and halt the project until more
funds can be raised.</TE>
<TE>   The current plan would improve weight and medical training
facilities and add locker rooms and meeting rooms, but the renovation
is less ambitious than recent projects at other Pacific 10 Conference
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "There is always room for improvement facilities-wise," football
Coach Bob Toledo said. "Look at what the schools in the Northwest
have done. That's what we need to do."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, who agreed to a five-year contract at $235,000 a year,
is all ears.</TE>
<TE>   "What any effective leader does is [identify] the leaders, talk to
them and assess the program," he said. "[I] have to find out what
UCLA does well and what needs to be improved."</TE>
<TE>   More than facilities will require examining. The athletic
department has been embarrassed by a series of NCAA violations and
other crises, including the handicapped parking scandal in 1999 and
the extra-benefits violation of star tailback DeShaun Foster last
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the school's signature program--men's basketball--has not
won a Pac-10 title in five years and is perceived by many as having
underachieved in Coach Steve Lavin's six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Although Guerrero fired 10 coaches in his first five years at
Irvine, he probably will refrain from using the ax on Lavin or Toledo
for at least a year. In fact, there is a strong feeling that only
Blackman and Carnesale wield the power to fire a high-profile Bruin
coach, and both men are said to be partial to Lavin and Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   Change is slow in a department where all eight associate or
assistant athletic directors besides Stephenson are UCLA graduates
and have been employed there for 20 years or more.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, few high-profile candidates showed interest in the
opening because of the relatively low salary and perception that the
athletic director lacks the power to make unilateral decisions on
matters of importance.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the challenges at UCLA are vastly different from those
at Irvine, a commuter school of 21,500 that fields teams in 23
sports.</TE>
<TE>   Besides resurrecting baseball, Guerrero's chief accomplishment was
hiring basketball Coach Pat Douglass in 1997. The Anteaters, who won
only one game the season before Guerrero became athletic director,
took the Big West Conference regular-season championship in 2001 and
shared it this season.</TE>
<TE>   There is no Anteater football team, but Guerrero's lack of
experience in that area does not bother Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   "The athletic director's job is to let the coaches coach and give
them the weapons to get the job done," he said. "I don't think it
matters that someone is from a school without a football team."</TE>
<TE>   It apparently didn't concern Carnesale, who made Guerrero the
first minority in UCLA athletic administration. He is one of four
Latino athletic directors in Division I-A.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a former Bruin athlete and it's wonderful to welcome him
home," Carnesale said. "We look forward to him making his mark in the
unmatched athletic tradition of this university."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero is glad to move north. UCLA might be only about 50 miles
from Irvine, but it is light-years ahead in athletic tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the chance to return to my alma mater and lead such a
prestigious athletic program are the reasons I embrace this
opportunity," he said. "I commend the outstanding work my
predecessors have done in guiding UCLA to the upper echelon of
intercollegiate athletics, and I look forward to building upon the
established excellence of the program."</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies his new challenge. Rather than launching sports from
scratch and turning around woeful losers, he must now measure success
in small increments because so many of the programs already are
established powers.</TE>
<TE>   There might be few days as satisfying as the one that came soon
after he had turned Cicerone's hand to cauliflower--the day he
watched the baseball team he resurrected post its first victory.</TE>
<TE>   The team Irvine beat? UCLA.</TE>

<HD>Pepperdine, Hawaii to Meet for Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pepperdine struggled at times but had too much firepower for
defending national champion Brigham Young Thursday night at Firestone
Fieldhouse in Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   The Waves shook off a loss in the third game and defeated the
defending national champion Cougars, 30-26, 30-24, 22-30, 30-25,
before 1,358.</LD>
<LD>   The victory earned Pepperdine a trip to Saturday night's Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation championship match against Hawaii (22-7).</LD>
<TE>   Pepperdine (27-4) won its 15th consecutive match and moved closer
to clinching a spot in the NCAA Final Four next week at Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the top-ranked Waves were to lose to the Rainbows, they
would be in consideration for the at-large berth to the Final Four.
But Pepperdine Coach Marv Dunphy doesn't want to leave anything to
chance.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do play for the MPSF championship and if you happen to
lose, there is an odds-on chance that you'll get in because of the
record," Dunphy said.</TE>
<TE>   "But then you're playing a guessing game and you're gambling that
you'll get chosen. I'm not a good gambler."</TE>
<TE>   Middle blocker Brad Keenan, who was named conference player of the
year Wednesday, was a force in the fourth game with six of his
match-high eight blocks. He put the Waves ahead for good by denying
BYU's Jonathan Alleman and Mike Wall on consecutive kill attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally learned how to block," a smiling Keenan said. "It
seemed like I couldn't block at all in those first two games."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine hit only .246 for the match (62 kills, 28 errors) but
had a balanced attack. Lance Walker had 14 kills, Keenan and Sean
Rooney had 13 and Fred Winters added 12. Chris Van Reusen added eight
kills with only one hitting error.</TE>
<TE>   Brigham Young (23-7) was led by Wall with 17 kills. The Cougars
were held to a .217 hitting percentage.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're a better team than us," Wall said. "But they're
beatable. They're not invincible. We could have done some things to
beat them."</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii defeated UC Santa Barbara, 30-27, 29-31, 31-29, 30-26.
Costas Theocharidis had 21 kills and Jose Delgado and Eyal Zimet had
11 apiece for the Warriors.</TE>

<LD>Bora Milutinovic, who led the United States to the second round of
the 1994 World Cup and who now is in charge of China's national team,
said Chinese players would be welcome to bring wives or girlfriends
to the World Cup, but only if they pay their own way.</LD>
<LD>   "As an old person, I am obviously not suitable to answer this
question," Milutinovic, 58, jokingly told Chinese reporters when
asked about conjugal arrangements for China's team.</LD>
<LD>   "I do not smoke, drink, and I don't indulge in women."</LD>
<TE>   According to Agence France-Presse, Milutinovic denied having said
that the Chinese Football Assn. would pick up the expense for wives
or girlfriends to travel to South Korea, where China will play Costa
Rica, Brazil and Turkey in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "Although I am old, I have a good memory, and I did not say that,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, if their families are willing to go to Korea at their
own expense, it is another matter."</TE>

<DH>Japan's imperial awards, which often go to bureaucrats, point up
its rigid, elitist ways and are in need of new selection criteria,
critics say.</DH>

<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>One's called the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with
Paulownia Flowers. Another is the meticulously described Order of the
Sacred Treasures, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon. Then there's the oddly
poetic Order of the Precious Crown, Ripple, evoking a hint of low-end
wine.</LD>
<LD>   The names may be reminiscent of a Monty Python skit, but the tributes
are among the most prestigious that Japanese citizens can receive for
their lifelong contributions to the nation.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, in 1971, a low-ranking government worker nominated for the
Order of the Sacred Treasure, Gold Medal, felt so inadequate at being
recognized that he committed suicide a week before the ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not qualified for the order," he wrote in his final note. "His
majesty would look at the list [and see how unworthy I am]."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, about 9,000 people, living and dead, will be honored by the
emperor. Bestowed with great pomp and circumstance, the awards are meant
to recognize the great achievements of the nation's very best native sons
and daughters and a handful of famous foreigners. But in the eyes of
some, they're also the epitome of everything that's wrong with Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "This system is really harmful," said Kei Mizusawa, author of the book
"The Decoration System Is Ruining Japan." "Honoring people based on their
titles rather than what they actually accomplished is a major impediment
to real reform in Japan."</TE>
<TE>   Japan started giving the awards in the 1870s in a bid to shake off
feudalism, hoping that the honoring of elites would inspire the masses.
The system--inspired by the French Legion of Honor and the British
tradition of knighting, and far stuffier than the U.S. Presidential Medal
of Freedom--borrowed elements from several European countries. The
winners were initially all chosen from Japanese government and military
circles.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, U.S. occupation forces put the kibosh on issuing
these trinkets of tribute, given their close association with war
criminals and imperial military traditions. Japanese conservatives spent
the next 19 years trying to bring the tribute system back, finally
succeeding in 1964 after a concession that civilians would be eligible as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the number of winners has ballooned to 20,000
annually, compared with at least 5,000 in France, Britain's 3,000 and
several hundred for the Medal of Freedom, raising concern about award
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   And although other nations have modernized and popularized their
national award systems--Britain honored the Beatles as early as 1965,
reasoning that the Fab Four did more for the country's image than a bevy
of bureaucrats--Japan has stuck to its rigid, elitist ways.</TE>
<TE>   The insular selection criteria have on occasion left the nation
embarrassed, as when global prizes are awarded to Japanese who haven't
been recognized in their own country. Most recently, the government's
Decoration Bureau, charged with overseeing the program, rushed to honor
author Kenzaburo Oe last year after he received the Nobel Prize in
literature--in 1994. He turned the government down.</TE>
<TE>   Today, nearly three-quarters of the public thinks that the award
criteria are overdue for reform, according to a poll released in January
by the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper. But change in Japan
tends to be slow, especially when it involves the imperial system, making
a significant departure unlikely any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   One major problem in the eyes of experts and the public is that 90% of
the top honors go to bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that ministry officials, who are responsible for selecting
the winners, have been embroiled in a parade of scandals over the past
decade and have badly fumbled the nation's economic, social and
industrial policies. Precedent and tradition dictate that the system
rumble on.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally against all these honors going to government officials,"
said Hideaki Nagasawa, a 40-year-old office worker in the food industry.
"Basically, these bureaucrats just end up awarding those inside their own
circle."</TE>
<TE>   Another concern is the way winners are chosen. In most categories,
applicants must be 70 or older and have held a top position for several
years. Some say this rewards archaic thinking, even as it encourages
senior officials to roost in important posts, blocking innovation and
younger colleagues' promotions.</TE>
<TE>   Under the system, which has changed little in 125 years, women are
ineligible for the highest awards. Instead, they're relegated to a lower
"women only" category with special bright yellow ribbons, presumably more
feminine-looking.</TE>
<TE>   "In Japan's so-called gender-equal society, people should be
recognized for their achievements, no matter their sex," said Kimiko
Yagi, professor of gender issues at Josai International University. "The
system is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   In a small nod to mass appeal, the government confers cultural awards
on popular figures, but these account for about five of the 20,000
dispensed annually. Those in favor of reform also complain that the
conservative selection system places far more weight on prestige and
large organizations than merit, entrepreneurship or any innovation that
might threaten the status quo--and help lead Japan out of its political
and economic morass.</TE>
<TE>   The system also carries some heavy historical baggage given its role
in World War II, when it inspired visions of imperial honor and the
prospect of official recognition.</TE>
<TE>   The rigid order of eight grades is closely associated with Japan's old
military structure. The date of this month's awards ceremony, the 29th,
is wartime Emperor Hirohito's birthday. And decorative medals are still
adorned with the blazing sun image found on battle flags throughout the
war.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole system elevates the old guard and undermines young people,"
said Tomokazu Ohsono, journalist and author of the book "Decoration
System: Behind the Scenes." "Most people don't realize how closely it's
tied to the old imperial system, although it clearly is."</TE>
<TE>   Although the honor and glory that come with this recognition are
arguably priceless, the cost gets pretty steep. Japan spends about $18
million annually on the medals, ribbons and boxes alone, not counting the
upkeep for about 65 bureaucrats and the estimated 100 artisans who
support the system. The Decoration Bureau won't disclose its total
budget.</TE>
<TE>   With the public starting to take more notice of the system's
inequities, a government committee recently mapped out the first real
reform in more than a century. Its recommendations include granting more
awards to ordinary people and ending the strict eight-tier ranking
system. But the power of tradition suggests that any change will be
modest at best.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty difficult to reduce the number of bureaucrats who win,"
said Kazumichi Sakamoto, a Decoration Bureau section head. "There are so
many people on the waiting list that it would be disruptive."</TE>
<TE>   Medals are handmade by Mint Bureau craftspeople drawing on skills once
used to hammer out samurai swords. Only the very best are allowed to work
on the most intricate medals, which can take up to six months to make and
cost $46,000 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   At a wooden desk littered with tools and brushes on the second floor
of a long, low building in Tokyo, artisan Hiroo Kato stoops over part of
a Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, First Grade, filing away
tiny imperfections he's spotted through a magnifying glass. Beside him
sits a glass jar with silver flecks collected from his labors. He worked
for 33 years before being given such a high-ranking medal to work on.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud," he says. "Sometimes when I see them giving out
awards on TV, I can't help but wonder if it's the one I worked on."</TE>
<TE>   President Eisenhower, recipient of an award in 1960, once called
Japan's medals the most beautiful in the world. And in the 1980s, Satoshi
Hakamada, a five-decade master craftsman, spoke angrily about how
occupying U.S. soldiers stole several from a safe shortly after the 1945
armistice.</TE>
<TE>   The emperor confers the awards at biannual ceremonies--April 29 and
Nov. 3--with the highest grades largely reserved for him and his family,
although President Reagan was given one, as were three Japanese prime
ministers. The orders and medals are made of gold, silver, pearls and
cloisonne bedecked with red, white, black, purple, yellow, orange and
blue ribbons.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of the very highest-ranking winners have theirs bestowed
personally by the emperor in ceremonies lasting about a minute. Lawmaker
Kanezo Muraoka, who rehearsed every step before his big moment last year,
said it was among the proudest days of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of lower-ranking recipients, meanwhile, have theirs handed
to them on chartered buses as they're routed through the palace for
pictures. Given the awards' 70-plus age requirement, moving the winners
and their spouses on and off the buses can be time-consuming.</TE>
<TE>   Those receiving the highest categories wear top-end frock coats or
special crest-emblazoned silk kimonos, which can cost upward of $12,000
and take 40 days to make.</TE>
<TE>   Once the awards are received, tradition dictates that recipients wear
them only at the most formal of events to preserve the dignity and
prestige of the system. As a result, many septuagenarians wear them only
twice: once at the ceremony itself and once in their caskets.</TE>
<TE>   Award holders quickly become the talk of their towns--and the target
of hungry salespeople--in much the same way U.S. lottery winners are
besieged. By regulation, only the recipient is allowed to wear the medal.
In reality, there's a vibrant secondhand market amid reports of
medal-bedecked collectors parading around their houses admiring
themselves in the mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Collectors pay upward of $150,000 for the rarest awards. Antiques
dealer Katsuo Nakahori was so taken with the awards, he squirreled away
100 during a lifetime of collecting. He even named his son after an
award.</TE>

<HD>Standard Set on Release of Rapists</HD>
<DH>Court: Ruling makes it harder for sex offenders who have served
their time to win freedom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court made it tougher Thursday for serial
sex offenders to win release from state mental hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   The state high court, acting in the case of serial rapist Patrick
Ghilotti, established a legal standard that will allow judges to keep
sexually violent predators locked up if two state-appointed mental health
experts determine that the inmate presents a "substantial danger" to
society.</LD>
<LD>   This will permit the state to commit offenders who are deemed to have
less than a 50% chance of attacking again, the court ruled. Defense
attorneys had argued that offenders should be released from state
hospitals unless they were more likely than not to rape or molest again.</LD>
<TE>   At issue was the meaning of a 1996 California law that allows the
state to commit repeat sex offenders after completion of their prison
terms if the felons are "likely" to commit sexual violence again.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling will affect hundreds of sex criminals who have been locked
up in California mental hospitals. It also will give the state a second
chance to keep Ghilotti confined to Atascadero State Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti, 46, was set to be freed in Marin County in December after
three mental health experts found that he was not "likely" to reoffend. A
Marin County judge and a Court of Appeal refused to stop his release, but
the state high court intervened.</TE>
<TE>   In its 5-2 ruling Thursday, the court said that Marin County Superior
Court Judge John S. Graham should again review Ghilotti's case to
determine whether his psychological evaluators complied with its new
"substantial danger" standard.</TE>
<TE>   If the judge determines that the evaluators failed to consider whether
Ghilotti remains a "substantial danger," the reports will have to be
redone and reviewed a second time.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Marvin Baxter, writing for the court majority, defined
substantial danger as "a serious and well-founded risk."</TE>
<TE>   That "does not mean that the risk of reoffense must be higher than
50%," Baxter wrote in People vs. Ghilotti, S102527.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the court said evaluators also may take into account
promises by the inmate to undergo therapy and take drugs to diminish his
sex drive.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, who filed a separate opinion in the
case, agreed that a judge should review Ghilotti's evaluations, but
objected to the new standard of "substantial danger."</TE>
<TE>   She said people should not be deprived of their liberty after serving
prison terms unless they are found to have greater than a 50% likelihood
of reoffending. She warned that the ruling may make California's 1996 sex
predator law vulnerable to a constitutional challenge if it is appealed
to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Almost any sex offender, regardless of his potential for future
violence, could be construed as likely to reoffend under the court's new
standard, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "While one clearly may prefer a scheme that confines all or nearly all
sexually violent predators beyond completion of their sentences--the
effective result of the majority's interpretation, despite its protests
to the contrary--that is not the scheme the Legislature chose," she
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's decision was the first to clarify the meaning of
California's Sexually Violent Predator Act, one of at least 15 similar
laws across the nation that permit repeat sex offenders to be committed
to mental institutions after prison.</TE>
<TE>   The act says the state may commit these offenders if they had multiple
victims and if at least two mental health experts determine that their
mental disorder makes them "likely" to attack again unless confined and
treated.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Legislature failed to define the meaning of "likely," the
court's determination that it means a "substantial danger" is consistent
with the law's purpose, Baxter wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "That purpose is to protect the public," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The decision also for the first time clarified that trial judges may
review the evaluators' reports and reject them, and that the
psychologists or psychiatrists who write the recommendations may consider
the fact that the inmate will continue to receive treatment for sexual
misconduct after being returned to the community.</TE>
<TE>   The state high court took the case on an emergency petition in
December. Gov. Gray Davis and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer asked the high
court to intervene and give the state's director of mental health the
power to override recommendations by psychological evaluators.</TE>
<TE>   The court rejected that approach. "This is not a plausible reading of
the statute," Baxter wrote.</TE>
<TE>   But Gov. Davis said Thursday that he was pleased with the court's
ruling. "I am convinced Mr. Ghilotti should remain locked up, and I
applaud the high court's wisdom in ensuring that proceedings to recommit
him can now go forward," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis recently backed a bill that would have allowed the director of
the Department of Mental Health to keep a sex offender in a hospital,
regardless of the recommendations of mental health evaluators. The
legislation failed.</TE>
<TE>   Justices Carlos R. Moreno and Janice Rogers Brown dissented in
Thursday's ruling, contending that the court could not require Marin
County Judge Graham to review Ghilotti's psychological evaluations
because the issue was not technically before the court.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno pointed out that the state Department of Mental Health and
Marin County prosecutors had failed to ask for such a review last year.
To order Graham to review the reports now would be appropriate only if
the judge had erred, he said. "The Superior Court in the present case did
not err," Moreno wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno, whose opinion was signed by Brown, favored the standard set by
the court for determining future danger, but he also amplified on it.</TE>
<TE>   He said the law requires "not just a risk of reoffense, but a high
risk of reoffense."</TE>
<TE>   "The risk of reoffense should be sufficiently high to distinguish the
'small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators' at
which the act is aimed from the general population of convicted violent
sex offenders, all of whom pose an elevated risk of recidivism," Moreno
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Frank J. Cox, chief deputy public defender for Marin County, said the
court's new standard will probably make it easier to commit sex offenders
to state hospitals after prison and to keep them in for long periods. But
he said he was glad that Ghilotti still has a chance at freedom, and will
not decide whether to appeal until Ghilotti's fate is known.</TE>
<TE>   "With good fortune, Marin County will release Patrick Ghilotti and we
will be on our way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cox said Ghilotti "should be released," but declined to speculate on
whether the trial court will determine that his evaluators complied with
the new standard.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti has been convicted of four rapes, and has admitted to six
others. After serving a 12-year prison term for the most recent rape, he
was committed to Atascadero, where he has spent the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Mayberg, director of California's Department of Mental Health,
said he was pleased that the court had provided a uniform standard for
evaluating predators.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the department believes Ghilotti could be released
safely if he were subject to certain conditions, such as mandated therapy
and drugs to reduce his sex drive. Ghilotti would have been returned to
Marin County without any supervision if the state Supreme Court had not
acted.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert R. Anderson, who has been fighting
to keep Ghilotti confined, said he was "pretty happy" with the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is a decision that advances public safety within the
state," Anderson said. "I think it will allow evaluators to make a more
reasoned assessment without being misguided by some type of belief that a
mathematical evaluation is required."</TE>

<HD>Asia's Wind-Borne Pollution a Hazardous Export to U.S.</HD>
<DH>Air: Dust, chemicals travel a long way. 'We're a small world,' one
scientist says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wind-borne pollution from China and neighboring countries is
spreading to California and other parts of the nation and Canada as a
result of surging economic activity and destructive farming practices
half a world away, according to new scientific studies.</LD>
<LD>   The research shows that a mix of pollutants, from dust to ozone to
toxic chemicals, travels farther than once realized.</LD>
<LD>   Federal air quality officials fear that the foreign-born pollution
will complicate efforts to cut smog and haze, and make it more difficult
to meet federal air quality standards in California and other parts of
the West.</LD>
<TE>   Although most of the pollutants are similar to ones already found in
North America, they do add to health concerns by slightly increasing
year-round concentrations of gases and tiny particles in the air,
according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   During peak winds, however, dust and smoke levels can approach or
exceed health-based standards. Federal scientists, too, are beginning to
probe the dust for bacteria and viruses that may be attached.</TE>
<TE>   The made-in-China label on haze over North America is partly due to
increased productivity of consumer goods ranging from patio furniture to
CDs to toys. But it also is a result of deforestation, over-grazing and
intensive cultivation of fragile soils.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at universities on both sides of the Pacific have been
tracking the haze for a number of years along its 6,000-mile journey,
using satellites and aircraft, land-based sensors and computer models.</TE>
<TE>   In one severe dust storm in spring 1998, particle pollution levels in
Oregon, Washington and British Columbia soared. In Seattle, air quality
officials could not identify a local source of the pollution, but
measurements showed that 75% of it came from China, researchers at the
University of Washington found.</TE>
<TE>   "A larger fraction of the haze we see is Asian, far more than we ever
dreamed," said Tom Cahill, professor of atmospheric science and physics
at UC Davis. "We're a small world. We're all breathing each other's
effluent."</TE>
<TE>   The amount of pollution reaching North America from Asia does not
equal that produced by the United States. But the impact of foreign-born
pollution is becoming more widely visible.</TE>
<TE>   The imported haze has recently been spotted at ski resorts from Lake
Tahoe to Aspen, Colo., and above Los Angeles and Vancouver, Canada. At
its worst, it can cast a faint, yellow hue across a 1,200-mile front from
Arizona to Calgary, Canada, and beyond before it peters out somewhere
over Greenland, studies show.</TE>
<TE>   "We may need to be more engaged in countries in Asia in helping them
clean up their industries and reduce pollution to protect the health of
Americans," said John Beale, deputy assistant administrator for air
programs at the Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   This week, scientists are launching a major new research project to
better understand the problem. Based in Monterey, dozens of scientists
plan to track pollutants reaching the West Coast. They have installed
wind and pollution sensors at coastal outposts from Goleta and Trinidad
in California to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   They will compare data with researchers in Japan, and study satellite
images from space and data from lasers aboard an airplane flying between
Seattle and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Called the Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation 2002
Project, the research effort will collect and analyze air pollution
samples through late May.</TE>
<TE>   What researchers don't fully understand yet is just how much pollution
drifts across the Pacific, its exact chemical composition, how it changes
once it reaches North America and how it affects the environment. They
also want to know how much air pollution comes from thousands of cargo
ships plying the Pacific to service the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   What they do know is that deserts in China and Mongolia are a major
source of pollution. Wind storms rake the Taklimakan and Gobi deserts,
where soil erosion is increasing, whipping towering clouds of dust miles
into the air. High-speed winds whisk them along at up to 1,500 miles per
day.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the pollution gets on that conveyor belt, it often doesn't run
into clouds or weather systems and doesn't mix or fall out of the air, so
you have largely undiluted pollution arriving in North America," said
Rudolf Husar, director of the Center for Air Pollution Impact and Trend
Analysis at Washington University in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   A process called desertification has intensified in China, home to
about 100 million peasant farms. As a result of drought, forest-clearing,
overgrazing and intensive cultivation, huge tracts have been stripped of
the vegetation that held the soil in place.</TE>
<TE>   Desertification affects one of every four acres in China today, Cahill
said.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous studies have linked microscopic airborne particles with a
host of health problems, including heart attacks, respiratory failure,
asthma and premature death. The smallest particles are too tiny to be
filtered by the body and penetrate deep into the lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Mixed with all the dust is another menace: Toxic and industrial
pollutants from farms, factories and power plants. China's coal-burning
power plants and factories emit roughly 40 million tons per year of
sulfur oxides, the most in the world and double the U.S. emissions of
that pollutant. "We're not breathing just dust, but dust and whatever
else has been deposited on it, like hundreds of compounds from man-made
pollution," said David Parrish, atmospheric chemist for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of all the mercury--a toxic metal--released in the
United States comes from fossil-fuel burning in Asia, said Daniel Jacob,
professor of atmospheric chemistry at Harvard University. Mercury is
found in some coal deposits and is released into the air primarily by
power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Also, pesticides that have been banned in the United States are part
of the fallout from dust blowing off farmland in China, said Dan Jaffe,
atmospheric chemist at the University of Washington. Among the pesticides
detected are DDT, toxaphene and dieldrin, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the United States, many of these pollutants are decreasing, yet in
these countries, the pollution is increasing," Jaffe said.</TE>
<TE>   Spring is when most of the pollution blows across the Pacific. For
example, after the 1998 dust storm, particle pollution levels across much
of the interior West tripled. An additional 20 to 50 micrograms of
particles were detected in valleys along the West Coast--equivalent to
one-third to three-quarters of the allowable particulate matter under EPA
pollution standards.</TE>
<TE>   Ozone also has been tracked moving across the North Pacific. In one
instance, concentrations at Cheeka Peak on the Olympic Peninsula in
Washington reached 70 parts per billion, 60% of the U.S. one-hour ozone
standard, Jaffe said.</TE>
<TE>   Ozone, a gaseous pollutant formed chemically in the air as emissions
from smokestacks, tailpipes and cleaning solvents react with sunlight, is
the common ingredient in smog, and highly destructive to lung tissue.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the year, however, pollution from Asia is less severe. Winds
wane in summer and the smog-conveyor belt slows down. Still, a steady
trickle of pollutants reaches North America throughout the year, adding 5
to 15 parts per billion of ozone, Jacob said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are unsure how the pollution affects the marine
environment. Dust can benefit marine ecosystems as minerals falling on
water enhance plankton. But dust blowing over the North Pacific sometimes
blocks about one-third of the sunlight reaching the ocean, reducing
energy available for biological productivity."We know it [haze] can
affect the weather in the North Pacific by cooling the air, but we are
trying to figure out what it means for climate and plankton," Cahill
said.</TE>

<HD>How the Looters Stole a Dream</HD>
<DH>Flight: Couple helped improve and unite a West Adams area. But when
their neighbors ransacked stores, it was time to leave L.A.</DH>
<SE>One in a series about the riots.
</SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing in front of his splendid Victorian above Tacoma's
Commencement Bay, Jeff Stvrtecky speaks of his years spent in the middle
of Los Angeles as if recalling a long-ago, passionate relationship that
just couldn't last.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a time when I loved L.A. so much . . . the culture, the
fun, the sun. . . . I couldn't imagine being anywhere else," he said as
the midmorning sun burned away the Puget Sound fog. "But you go through
stages in life, and other things become more important."</LD>
<LD>   Stvrtecky still loved Los Angeles after the 1992 riots, and still
believed in its potential. But after seeing his neighbors loot stores as
a gun battle raged in front of his house just off Western Avenue and
Venice Boulevard, he no longer wanted to live with its mood swings. "Los
Angeles had come back before, and I felt the city would come back [again
after the riots]. I just didn't want to wait."</LD>
<TE>   He and his companion, Jon Rake, moved in August 1993. Their home
lingered on a depressed market until Stephen Wallis and Eileen Ehmann
bought it and continued the journey.</TE>
<TE>   Patience ran out for a lot of Angelenos in the 1990s. Even before the
riots, Los Angeles residents were leaving the city by the thousands. Many
moved to neighboring counties, lured by lower housing prices or the
perceived safety of newer suburbs. Many others left the state entirely,
adding to population booms in other parts of the West.</TE>
<TE>   The number of Californians who left the state had begun exceeding
those who moved in from other states by 1991. The largest number of
California transplants moved to Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and
Colorado. The net outflow of Californians, measured by the Department of
Motor Vehicles, lasted until 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Because so many moved away, with so many individual reasons, the
migration cannot be pegged to a single event or motive. Los Angeles took
a series of hard blows in the space of just a few years: a faltering
economy and real estate market, racial tensions highlighted by the riots
and natural disasters such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Stvrtecky, a music conductor, and Rake, a choreographer, had already
been thinking of moving to Tacoma, Wash., before the riots. They owned a
house there that they rented out, and had dreams of starting a musical
theater company. A bed-and-breakfast inn they had run out of their house
in L.A.'s historic West Adams district had gone out of business. They
were gradually scaling back their commitments to L.A., but figured they
could stay years longer.</TE>
<TE>A Bullet Pierces Feeling of Security</TE>
<TE>   They had moved to West Adams in 1985, part of a wave of younger
couples and families. The newcomers often bought the homes of departing
seniors or neglected houses that had been occupied by renters. They
lovingly restored the early 20th century houses, which they often bought
at low prices, and bonded through neighborhood beautification work. They
prided themselves as multiracial urban pioneers just two miles from
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The riots reached them with a warning on April 29, 1992. They had been
watching television news in their living room, and knew rioters were
headed north, toward them. Then someone ran down their street and
announced the appliance store at their corner would be looted.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting started moments later. The appliance store's owner and a
group of young men Stvrtecky and Rake knew to be local gang members were
firing at each other. The gang members positioned themselves in front of
Stvrtecky's house, some of them firing from the porch.</TE>
<TE>   Rake was on the living room floor calling 911 when a bullet hit him.</TE>
<TE>   The shot passed through the house's siding, a stud and an overstuffed
chair before ricocheting in the living room, retaining only enough energy
to bounce off Rake's chest. The bullet didn't even break his skin. "I
actually thought it would be kind of a fun thing to talk about."</TE>
<TE>   More than the gunshots and fires, what horrified the pair was what
they began to see out of their living room window: their neighbors
returning from looting.</TE>
<TE>   "The devil took over that day," Rake said. "Even those we took to be
good people were swept up in it." The sight of people they knew running
home with shoes and televisions taken from nearby stores terrified them.
Good people had gone bad. Where were the police? Where would it stop?</TE>
<TE>Seeing Neighbors in a Different Light</TE>
<TE>   "The most fearful moment of my life," Stvrtecky said--including living
through last Sept. 11 while visiting Manhattan. Those villains were
strangers. These were people they knew and trusted, in some cases using
trucks or dollies to move their loot.</TE>
<TE>   "The appliance store was empty in 15 or 20 minutes. They were so well
organized," Stvrtecky said. "People lost their businesses to our own
neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   Stvrtecky became hysterical, saying "We're going to die!" over and
over. "I had to slap him," Rake recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of the National Guard restored order, Rake said. Feeling
safe again he was able to focus on what to do with no electricity and a
kitchen full of perishable food. He and others on the block faced their
plight the best way they knew how. They threw a party.</TE>
<TE>   Grills were fired up in frontyards, the barbecue smoke blending with
the smoke from the smoldering stores on Western. As they grilled the
contents of their refrigerators, the neighbors gazed up the street at the
armed Guard troops standing watch and took stock of their community.</TE>
<TE>   "Sitting on the porch, having a drink, talking through our fear," Rake
said. "It was disheartening. It was as if all of our hard work could go
up in smoke in a matter of hours."</TE>
<TE>   In past years, Rake had organized a neighborhood planting project that
lined the sidewalks with 200 magnolias, jacarandas and other trees. A
group had gathered on Saturday mornings with paint buckets, brushes and
rollers, walking through the neighborhood to paint over graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there was little talk of moving away but much discouragement.
"The fighter in me said to stay and fix it again," Rake said. "Another
part just felt defeated."</TE>
<TE>   In the days after the riot, he organized a massive neighborhood
cleanup. The White House got word of his work, and Rake was flown to
Washington in 1993 to accept an award from President Clinton. But even as
he continued his community work, Rake and Stvrtecky were tying up loose
ends to prepare for their move.</TE>
<TE>   "Enough was enough," said Stvrtecky, now 44. "We realized quality of
life was just too important to us."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the desire to escape traffic or crime. Tacoma's slice of
Interstate 5 during rush hour is as choked as an L.A. freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Stvrtecky and Rake live in a peaceful neighborhood, but on the day a
reporter visited them, the top story in the city's newspaper was of a
mass-murder trial involving members of a mostly Cambodian gang called the
Loc'd Out Crips. The cover story in the alternative weekly paper was a
piece on local white supremacists.</TE>
<TE>   Stvrtecky and Rake appreciate the fact that their new city's urban
problems are not right out their front door, but insist that was never
the point of their move.</TE>
<TE>   What they sought, and found, in Tacoma was a chance to fulfill their
musical ambitions. Los Angeles hardly needed another theater company or
choral group. Tacoma, which in the early 1990s was in the early stages of
a local arts renaissance, was eager for both.</TE>
<TE>Quickly Finding Roles in New City's Culture</TE>
<TE>   Within months of their arrival, Rake and Stvrtecky founded the Tacoma
Musical Playhouse, headed by Rake, and the Tacoma Master Chorale, run by
Stvrtecky. After first performing in church basements and school
auditoriums, Rake and Stvrtecky were able to convert an old movie theater
into a permanent venue for the groups.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, their lives became even more hectic than their fast-paced
life in Los Angeles. They usually don't wrap up their day at the theater
until rehearsals end about 10 at night.</TE>
<TE>   The work is so exhilarating they hardly miss the performances, night
life and restaurants they enjoyed so much in L.A. What they miss about
the city surprised them: In Tacoma, they don't feel as close to their
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "We hardly talk to anyone now," said Rake, 43. Part of it is due to
their round-the-clock work hours, and part of it is weather that often
precludes gathering outside, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tacoma has made them believe that one thing that pushed neighbors to
work together in West Adams was the sheer difficulty of living in urban
Los Angeles, tribulations too big to face alone.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the gunshots, the helicopters and the graffiti,"
Stvrtecky said. "One reason we're not as friendly with the neighbors here
is there aren't the issues here that draw people together" in West Adams.</TE>
<TE>   In the torpid real estate market after the riots, it took Rake and
Stvrtecky four years to sell their house, which they eventually let go
for about $100,000 less than they owed on it.</TE>
<TE>   Those who followed Rake and Stvrtecky's lead--swallowing hard, cutting
their losses and moving on from Los Angeles in the '90s--opened a door
for people such as Stephen Wallis and Eileen Ehmann.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Wallis, then 34, and Ehmann, 37, were ready to leave their
suburbs of Long Beach and Santa Monica to buy a house together.</TE>
<TE>   What they could afford in West Adams astounded them. If they were to
give life in the middle of the city a shot, they'd get an elegant
five-bedroom house for less than $200,000--about half the median price in
Santa Monica at the time. "We just couldn't believe we could get a house
like that," Wallis said.</TE>
<TE>   Five years after the riots, Wallis and Ehmann found conditions in West
Adams a bit like they were when Rake and Stvrtecky moved there. Property
values had plummeted, crime was among their neighbors' top concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The house had been damaged by careless tenants in the years it was
rented, spoiling some of Rake and Stvrtecky's restoration.</TE>
<TE>   But many of those who had labored to keep the neighborhood up were
still there, and other new residents were eager to join the area's
tradition of neighborhood activism.</TE>
<TE>Newcomers Help Make It 'Truly a Neighborhood'</TE>
<TE>   "We came at the right time. There were about five other young couples
who came in when we did. We had a lot of energy. We were all going to
protect our investment," Wallis said.</TE>
<TE>   Wallis, director of operations at the Grove shopping mall in the
Fairfax district, and Ehmann, a senior secretary at the Getty Center,
immersed themselves in community activities.</TE>
<TE>   Wallis and neighbors planted 26 new magnolias on their street,
replacing trees that had been damaged or died. He later found out the
original trees had been planted in the earlier effort led by Rake.</TE>
<TE>   "I picked up his crusade without knowing it," Wallis said.</TE>
<TE>   With their neighbors, they conducted a cleanup day, picking up trash
on the sidewalks between Pico and Washington boulevards and Normandie and
Western avenues.</TE>
<TE>   The projects led to friendships, and made them feel a little like they
lived in a small town in the midst of a metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   "I can literally walk from block to block, house to house, and know
everyone. It's truly a neighborhood," Wallis said. "It's full of great,
great people. We all watch out for each other--whites, blacks, Asians,
Hispanics, straights, gays," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wallis thinks race relations have continued to improve since the
riots, a perception confirmed by public opinion polls.</TE>
<TE>   What worries him more about the city's future is not so much racial
tensions, but the feeling that even when people get along and work
together, it's not enough. He and his neighbors win battles against
blight every week, but the war never stops.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling the neighborhood trash pickup, Wallis describes the
triumphant feeling in the community when they saw the clean sidewalks and
the small mountain of stuffed trash bags they had gathered.</TE>
<TE>   "Then within a week it was back. Tires, building debris" were again
dumped on the sidewalks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   So Ehmann, feeling fed up, got neighbors together and arranged for 66
waste baskets to be put up in front of neighborhood businesses. They
worked beautifully for a few months, until they stopped being emptied.
Then within a year most of them were stolen.</TE>
<TE>Old Couch Hauled Off and Another Appears</TE>
<TE>   It is still common for Ehmann and Wallis to wake up and find an
abandoned couch in front of their house. More couches, mattresses and
other garbage dumped at midnight always appear shortly after the previous
load is removed, as does the graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   Wallis faults the perpetrators for their disregard of others, but also
wonders why the city can't manage to keep neighborhoods clean. "Can you
imagine what it would be like if the city just functioned like a
municipality should? If we as individuals don't take it upon ourselves to
do something, it just doesn't get done here."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Ehmann said, she is willing to put in the time with her
neighbors to see that their area is kept up. She still enjoys the
camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   But she's wearying. She feels like her community is "trying to hold
back the tide, and sometimes it's a thing that's getting too big for us
to take on" without more support. "It's really tiring."</TE>
<TE>   She has never met Jeff Stvrtecky or Jon Rake, but she occasionally
sounds like them.</TE>
<TE>   "After living here a while I can really understand how people can say
'I've had it.' I'm not there yet, but I can really understand."</TE>

<HD>Long Distance May Face a Very Short Future</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Big firms see their profits fade as more customers go
wireless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As long-distance companies watch their calls and profits slip away
to rivals such as cellular phone networks, the day may soon come when
their business--once considered a pillar of American enterprise--ceases
to exist.</LD>
<LD>   Krystin Alexander is part of the reason. The 33-year-old New Orleans
resident no longer makes the distinction between a local and a
long-distance phone call. When she dials a number on her wireless phone,
she pays the same amount regardless of how many miles separate her from
the person on the other end of the line.</LD>
<LD>   "People with land lines have to pay long distance," said the executive
assistant at an engineering firm, who has gone completely wireless. "We
don't even think about that stuff anymore."</LD>
<TE>   Just as technology dissolved the notion of distance, it now is
dismantling one of the key industries built up around it. That, coupled
with changes in the laws governing local phone monopolies, has resulted
in a steady stream of bad news from blue-chip companies such as AT&amp;T
Corp. and WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Long-distance giant WorldCom, the parent company of MCI, said Thursday
that first-quarter profit plunged 78%. A day earlier, AT&amp;T said it lost
nearly $1 billion for the first three months of the year as it incurred
the defection of customers to wireless services, prepaid calling cards
and other less expensive alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   For both companies, call volume fell significantly as customers
continue to find other ways to reach out and touch friends and family in
far-off places. But revenue dropped even faster as competition and new
technology forced prices down.</TE>
<TE>   It's a trend hammering all long-distance companies--and one without an
apparent solution.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure it will ever get better for them," said Pat Comack, a
telecom analyst with Guzman &amp; Co. in Miami. "At the end of the day,
they're pretty much doomed. Long distance will be a memory."</TE>
<TE>   With it will be billions of dollars of shareholders' money. Once
considered among the safest bets for investors, shares of long-distance
companies have fallen sharply since the late 1990s. AT&amp;T, for instance,
closed Thursday at $13.49--down from $49.18 just three years ago--on the
New York Stock Exchange. And WorldCom's Thursday close of $3.53 on Nasdaq
is well off its 1999 price of $61.99.</TE>
<TE>An Increasingly Crowded Market</TE>
<TE>   The problem for traditional long-distance companies is that the market
they once had all to themselves is being bombarded by new competitors
such as wireless firms, Internet upstarts and cable providers. Even local
phone companies such as SBC Pacific Bell, which for years were excluded
from the market by law, are winning regulatory approval to offer
long-distance services.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the prices that long-distance companies can charge
to the customers they have managed to hang on to have been falling
steadily and now amount to just pennies a minute. That, in turn, helped
kill the mind-set that spending time on the phone was a luxury that must
be regulated by an egg timer.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an aura among my parents' generation that if someone's
calling cross-country, you should get to that call immediately because it
costs a lot of money," said Jeff Pulver, who publishes a newsletter based
in Melville, N.Y., about communications technology. "Other generations
assume that costs are associated with distance, but now it costs 2 cents
a minute. Cost has nothing to do with distance."</TE>
<TE>   For years, long-distance calls were more expensive than local calls
because providers such as AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint Corp. had to pay fees to
local phone companies to have their long-distance calls begin and end on
local networks. Over time, the Federal Communications Commission has
reduced those fees from several cents each to only half a penny apiece,
Pulver said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of cost is from originating and terminating a call, not how far
it goes," he said. The marginal cost of carrying a call farther on a
company's phone network amounts to "some fraction of a penny per call."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a new generation of upstarts such as Qwest Communications
International Inc. and Level 3 Communications Inc. built fiber-optic
networks that relied on more efficient Internet-style systems to move
voice and data traffic. The new networks allow vastly more calls to share
a single line by breaking them into packets and sealing them in their own
electronic envelopes.</TE>
<TE>   "Internet telephony has reduced costs by 80% to 90%," said Roger Wery,
a partner at PRTM, a telecommunications consulting firm in San Francisco.
"It's a dramatically different cost structure." Wery said his own monthly
long-distance bill has plunged from $300 eight years ago to less than $40
today.</TE>
<TE>   The long-distance business was essentially created in 1984, when the
federal government carved seven local phone monopolies out of AT&amp;T. The
company formerly known as Ma Bell could offer only long-distance service,
and the Baby Bells were allowed to handle only local traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years later, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of
1996, allowing local and long-distance companies to enter one another's
markets. But of the two, the local market has proved far more resilient
to competition.</TE>
<TE>   "When they broke up AT&amp;T in 1984, they didn't allow the [Baby Bells]
to offer long distance, so they created a long-distance industry,"
analyst Comack said. "When they passed the Telecom Act of 1996, they
destroyed the long-distance industry."</TE>
<TE>Carriers Try to Diversify</TE>
<TE>   Realizing that they were in danger of getting stuck in a low-margin
commodity business, long-distance companies responded by trying to
diversify.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T bought computer giant NCR Corp. and wireless provider McCaw
Cellular to gain entry into new markets. It also bought cable giants
Tele-Communications Inc. and MediaOne in an attempt to gain direct access
into consumers' homes and return to the local phone business. AT&amp;T has
since shed NCR and is in the process of selling the cable properties,
transactions that resulted in billions of dollars of losses.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom went on its own buying spree to become a company focused on
business services such as data networks, Internet access and Web hosting.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint has concentrated on building a wireless powerhouse, Sprint PCS,
that treats local and long-distance calls equally. Long-distance
companies still collect some money when wireless customers make
long-distance calls, but they can charge only wholesale rates with
razor-thin margins.</TE>
<TE>   And that ultimately benefits callers such as Alexander, who used to
spend about $70 a month making long-distance calls to friends and family
in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "My phone bills used to go through the roof," she said. "I used to
take them out of the mail and hide them from [my husband]."</TE>
<TE>   In July, when the couple upgraded from dial-up Internet access to a
high-speed cable modem, they decided to save some money by getting rid of
their land line altogether. Now they use e-mail and their wireless phone
to communicate instead. Alexander pays just $40 a month for 3,500 minutes
of air time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot more convenient," she said.</TE>

<HD>Lower Tax Receipts Could Double U.S. Budget Deficit</HD>
<DH>Revenue: A shortfall is likely, but administration officials say
there's still time to reverse the trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Individual income tax receipts are running far below expectations
this year, threatening to punch a $50-billion-plus hole in the current
federal budget and undercut efforts to pay for the 10-year,
$1.35-trillion tax cut.</LD>
<LD>   Daily Treasury Department reports show that receipts through
Wednesday, the latest date available, were $102.2 billion lower than at
the same time last fiscal year, with less than half the difference
traceable to the tax cut.</LD>
<LD>   The size of the shortfall has even some Republican budget experts
worried. "We knew there was going to be some reduction because of the tax
cuts," said G. William Hoagland, GOP staff director of the Senate Budget
Committee. "What's surprising is the order of magnitude of the reduction
not accounted for by the cut."</LD>
<TE>   Hoagland said that the slippage is likely to double this year's budget
deficit, which the Congressional Budget Office recently estimated would
run $46 billion, a sharp reversal from the huge surpluses of the late
1990s and early this decade.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me nervous," he said.</TE>
<TE>   White House and Treasury officials refused to comment publicly on the
tax downdraft but asserted privately there is still time for the trend to
reverse itself. Individual income tax receipts, which account for half of
Washington's annual revenues, swing wildly in April as taxpayers wait
until the last minute to pay, the U.S. Postal Service takes time to
deliver the checks to the Internal Revenue Service and the IRS makes
mistakes tallying up the money.</TE>
<TE>   However, with only four business days left in the month and with
evidence that well over two-thirds of the year's individual tax receipts
are already in, budget veterans and independent analysts said the odds
are high the government will come up substantially short.</TE>
<TE>   And, these officials said, the apparent source of the shortfall
suggests that the problem won't be transitory but rather could involve a
return to the budgetary nightmares that plagued Washington for most of
the two decades before the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "During the late '90s, there was a series of favorable federal income
tax surprises that pushed up revenues," said John Youngdahl, an economist
with the New York-based investment bank Goldman Sachs. "What we're seeing
is that these are now reversing."</TE>
<TE>   The recent shortfalls "are likely to be harbingers of revenue problems
that will be with us for some time to come," Youngdahl said.</TE>
<TE>   The chief source of the 1990s surprises was a boom in the
capital-gains taxes that people paid on their stock market winnings, as
well as similar bursts in tax payments on stock option gains and wage
bonuses. Although it will be months before the details are known,
analysts said it appears that most of the current falloff in revenues is
concentrated in precisely these areas.</TE>
<TE>   Federal budget officials had always assumed that tax revenues from
capital gains, options and the like would slip in the wake of the stock
market drop that began in the spring of 2000. But there are signs in the
recent Treasury reports that they substantially underestimated the extent
of the fall.</TE>
<TE>   While the reports through Wednesday show that individual income tax
revenues overall were down 11% from the same period a year ago, they show
that the portion of receipts that typically include capital gains--that
taxpayers handle when they settle up with the government on April 15
rather than having withheld from their paychecks during the year--had
plunged a whopping 64%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and budget experts said that the recent revenue falloff is
particularly disturbing because it has occurred during a period when the
stock market, though still far from its early 2000 highs, had partially
recovered, and when the economy, though technically in recession, had
continued to perform better than many expected.</TE>
<TE>   They said that the shortfall could mean Washington will no longer be
able to count on the kind of revenue burst from capital gains and related
sources it enjoyed during the late 1990s unless the historic stock market
boom of that time repeats itself--a scenario few expect. That would make
it very difficult for the government to recover from the deficit it is
expected to post this fiscal year, something that Bush administration
officials had said could be easily accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   "If these trends continue, it's bad news for the budget, and not just
for this year," said Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the
ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. "It indicates that the
deficit could be a much deeper, more intractable problem than we'd
thought."</TE>
<TE>   The political consequences could be almost as dire.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush came to office promising that a surplus-drenched
Washington had enough money to stash away Social Security and Medicare
savings for the impending baby boom retirement, spend more on such
programs as education and cut taxes by $1.35 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   Although the stock market plunge, a recession and the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks drastically changed national circumstances, White House
budget officials have insisted the combination would have only a
transitory effect on the federal budget--pushing it back into deficits,
but only by comparatively small sums and only for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Budget officials estimated that the combination of setbacks, plus the
tax cut, would trim individual income tax receipts by only $45 billion
this year, from $995 billion in fiscal 2001 to $950 billion this fiscal
year.</TE>
<TE>   But individual tax receipts are arriving at a pace that suggests that,
when fully collected, they will be about $50 billion short of the
administration's goal. In addition, some other tax revenues are also
running behind, according to budget experts.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, they said, the deficit for the curent fiscal year, which
began Oct. 1, is likely to double to $100 billion or more. By contrast,
Washington managed a surplus of $127 billion in the last fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, administration forecasts of returning to a surplus by
fiscal 2004 are likely to prove overly optimistic. The new tax receipt
numbers "raise some concern about the president's commitment to get back
to balance by 2004," said Hoagland, the Senate Republican staffer.</TE>
<TE>   Many budget analysts predicted that once the economy recovered,
Washington would return to something like the heady tax revenue days of
the late 1990s. But with the government set to issue new growth numbers
later today that show the economy expanding at a better-than-3% annual
rate during the first three months of the year, and still no improvement
in the tax revenue picture, hopes for a quick turnaround in the budget
situation are fading.</TE>
<TE>   The revenue shortfall will put added pressure on Congress to pare
spending and could fuel demands to slow or reverse portions of the Bush
tax cut. The president's proposal was premised on the notion that
Washington would collect $5.6 trillion in surpluses over 10 years, an
outcome that now seems highly unlikely.</TE>

<HD>Saudi Prince Warns Bush to Rein In Israel</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Leader predicts 'grave consequences' if the U.S. does not
do more to halt the violence. But he pledges that oil will not be used as
a weapon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia delivered a stern warning to
President Bush on Thursday that the United States would face what a top
Saudi advisor said were "grave consequences" if it does not rein in
Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Abdullah, the de facto ruler of the desert kingdom, spent five hours
at Bush's ranch in central Texas, the informality of the setting barely
masking the divisions in Washington's relations with one of its most
important Middle East partners.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, offering an upbeat account after the meeting, said the United
States and Saudi Arabia shared a vision of Israelis and Palestinians
living in peace. He said he and Abdullah had "established a strong
personal bond."</LD>
<TE>   He also said the Saudis had made it clear "that they will not use oil
as a weapon" in Middle East diplomacy. Abdullah's advisor, Adel Jubeir,
confirmed the pledge.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate that, respect that, and expect that to be the case,"
Bush added.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting, scheduled more than a month ago, took on increasing
importance by the day amid the Israeli-Palestinian violence. During the
last six weeks, Palestinian militants repeatedly engaged in suicide
bombings and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dispatched troops to
occupy Palestinian territory in the West Bank. Since March 29, Israeli
troops have confined Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to a
small corner of his headquarters in the city of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Reporting on Abdullah's sharp-edged message to Bush, Jubeir, the crown
prince's foreign policy aide, said: "If Sharon is left to his own
devices, he will drag the region over a cliff, and that does not serve
America's interest and it does not serve Saudi Arabia's interest."</TE>
<TE>   "If the United States doesn't do more to reduce the violence," he said
Abdullah told Bush, "there will be grave consequences for the U.S. and
its interests."</TE>
<TE>   He did not elaborate on what the consequences would be. Nor did the
Saudis say publicly what more they want the U.S. to do to influence
Sharon's policies.</TE>
<TE>   However, the U.S.-Saudi relationship, nurtured over many decades, is
built on Saudi oil, American weapons and a recognition that each country
needs the other--not just for economic reasons but also for maintaining
stability in the inflamed Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The United States buys 1.7 million barrels of Saudi oil a day, more
than twice the amount of 15 years ago, and is Saudi Arabia's biggest
customer.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudis in turn buy more American weapons than anyone else--$39
billion in purchases in the 1990s, a figure that in some cases has kept
individual U.S. businesses from going under.</TE>
<TE>   Jubeir said Saudi Arabia did not see oil as a weapon to be wielded in
its foreign policy battles.</TE>
<TE>   "Oil is not a tank. You cannot fire oil," he said, pointing the thumb
and forefinger of each hand as though they were pistols.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Abdullah are known for speaking bluntly, and Jubeir said the
crown prince did little to hide his growing dismay with the failure of
the United States to exert some muscle on Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   "He's direct and sincere and he doesn't mince his words--like the
president," he said of Abdullah.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking with reporters after Abdullah left the ranch, Bush said, as
he has in the past, that the Palestinian Authority must do more to end
terrorist attacks, and Israel must complete its withdrawal from the
territory it has recently occupied. He said Israel must end the standoffs
in Ramallah and Bethlehem, where its troops have besieged Palestinian
gunmen, civilians and others in the Church of the Nativity.</TE>
<TE>   The president said he and the crown prince, who left without speaking
to journalists, had agreed that "the world must join in offering
humanitarian aid to the many innocent Palestinians who are suffering."</TE>
<TE>   Though the meeting was drawn up with a wide agenda, reflecting the
reach of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, the accounts by Bush and a senior
administration official made it clear that the discussion was monopolized
by the efforts to calm the latest Middle East tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Bush had assured Abdullah that he would put more
pressure on Israel, the senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said, "The president talked again with the crown prince
about the responsibilities of all the parties" in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The official, offering an account that differed in tone from that of
the Saudi advisor, said Abdullah "expressed nothing as a threat to
U.S.-Saudi relations."</TE>
<TE>   The talks have been among the most anxiously awaited of the Bush
administration. Relations between the two countries, often skittish, have
been more on edge since the Sept. 11 attacks; 15 of the 19 suspected
hijackers were Saudis.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, a Saudi telethon for the Palestinian cause drew
widespread criticism in the U.S. By some accounts, it raised about $100
million--some of it going to the families of suicide bombers. The senior
U.S. official said that while Bush and Abdullah met privately, the U.S.
delegation questioned Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal "about
what had been going on here."</TE>
<TE>   The Saudis responded, the aide said, that the money was being used for
humanitarian needs and that they distinguished it from the help officials
say Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has given to families whose children
are suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah had twice put off visiting Bush, to show his displeasure with
the U.S. president's failure to become more engaged in seeking a
settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   He finally accepted an invitation in mid-March when Vice President
Dick Cheney visited him in Jidda. At that time, Abdullah was advancing
his own recipe for peace, Bush had come to recognize that he could not
avoid the conflict, and the U.S. was seeking allies for an expansion of
the war on terrorism, possibly targeting Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In the Saudi view, the Bush administration's reputation has been
called into question in the region because Israel ignored the president's
April 4 call to completely withdraw from the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah has been Saudi Arabia's day-to-day ruler since King Fahd, his
half-brother, suffered a stroke in 1995. The crown prince sponsored the
recent Arab League offer for normal relations with Israel in return for
an Israeli withdrawal from territory it has occupied since the 1967
Middle East war.</TE>
<TE>   Bush uses a visit to his 1,600-acre Prairie Chapel Ranch as a plum
held out to only the most important foreign leaders. Since taking office,
he has played host there to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah arrived for the meeting 10 minutes late, accompanied by
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. The foreign minister and the Saudi
ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar ibn Sultan, were in a
trailing limousine. Cheney and other senior officials were already at the
ranch. The president greeted Abdullah just outside the front door of the
ranch house.</TE>
<TE>   They met privately for about 75 minutes, with only a translator
present, the White House said. Later, they toured the spread, its grasses
growing green, the canyons hiding wildlife, the bluebonnets and pink
poppies in bloom.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a man who's got a farm and he understands the land," Bush said,
"and I really took great delight in being able to drive him around in a
pickup truck and showing him the trees and my favorite spots. And we saw
a wild turkey, which was good."</TE>
<TE>   "We spent a lot of time alone, discussing our respective visions,
talking about our families," he added. Throughout the day, Bush referred
to the crown prince as "your royal highness."</TE>

<HD>Chechen Rebel Chief Is Reported Dead</HD>
<DH>Russia: The notorious Khattab was slain in March, intelligence
agency claims, but even Putin seems skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The Russian intelligence service says it's true--but no one else
seems to be buying it just yet. Even President Vladimir V. Putin sounded
dubious Thursday about claims that one of Moscow's most hated enemies had
been killed in Chechnya.</LD>
<LD>   Islamic guerrilla leader Khattab is to Russians roughly what Osama bin
Laden and the Taliban's Mullah Mohammed Omar have become to Americans: a
sworn, ruthless nemesis who always seems maddeningly just out of reach.</LD>
<LD>   The Jordanian-born, Russian-educated radical with a reputation for
savagery has been one of the top three commanders of the rebels fighting
for independence in Chechnya, a predominantly Muslim Russian republic in
the Caucasus region. Russians consider him the rebels' main connection to
Bin Laden's terrorist network.</LD>
<TE>   His demise, if true, would be a major victory for Russian forces,
which have fought the rebels in Chechnya in two wars since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to think this is the case," Putin said in televised
remarks about the report. "In any case, I am sure that such an end is in
store for all these terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think we should wait until we get confirmation of this
information," he added, "[in order] to consider it absolutely objective."</TE>
<TE>   The FSB, the main successor agency to the KGB, said Thursday that it
would provide the Russian media with proof of Khattab's death soon. But
its announcement lacked any details about how and when Khattab--who goes
by one name--was killed or where his body was.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the Interfax news agency quoted an anonymous FSB source, who
indicated that Khattab was killed in an operation conducted by the
intelligence service in March.</TE>
<TE>   "We can declare this with a high degree of certitude because Khattab
has not surfaced. . . . He has not had any radio contacts, and the
activities of rebels in the area controlled by Khattab are
uncoordinated," Interfax quoted the source as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Zakayev, who was appointed by ousted Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov to represent the rebel side in proposed peace talks with
Russia, said the report of Khattab's death was groundless.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by telephone, he told Associated Press that Khattab was in
fine health and "at his post."</TE>
<TE>   A similar claim was made in a report on the Web site of the Kavkaz
Center, a pro-Chechen group.</TE>
<TE>   But Echo of Moscow radio, quoting an unnamed military source, said a
decapitated body that might be Khattab's was in a military morgue in the
southern city of Rostov-on-Don.</TE>
<TE>   That there is mystery surrounding his purported death is typical for
Khattab, about whom little is known. He reportedly is a veteran of wars
in Afghanistan and the Balkans and is thought to have joined the Chechen
guerrillas in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   According to news reports, Khattab is believed to have come from a
wealthy Jordanian family and once studied in Moscow. He led Islamic
fighters who attempted to spread insurrection to Dagestan, a Russian
republic bordering Chechnya--one of the factors cited by Russia in 1999
when it sent troops to put down the separatist-minded government of
Maskhadov.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, at least 3,000 Russian troops and uncounted Chechen rebels
and civilians have died in a grinding war that shows little sign of
abating.</TE>
<TE>   "Until you see the dead body, you cannot say someone is dead," Akhmad
Kadyrov, head of Chechnya's pro-Kremlin administration, told The Times in
a telephone interview. "Neither I personally, nor any of my people, have
seen Khattab's corpse with our own eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Kadyrov noted that there have been other occasions when Russians have
declared rebel commanders dead, "and then these field commanders would
resurface in a totally different corner of Chechnya alive and kicking."</TE>
<TE>   Because Khattab reportedly helped funnel funds from the Middle East
and Afghanistan to support the Chechen rebels, his death could mean more
than just the elimination of one more warlord, Kadyrov said.</TE>

<HD>'Roh Tempest' Blows Across South Korea</HD>
<DH>Politics: With a surprise showing in new U.S.-style primaries, an
obscure, left-leaning lawyer has become the front-runner in presidential
polls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INCHON, South Korea
</DL>
<LD>In a boisterous new experiment with U.S.-style primaries, a
relatively unknown human rights lawyer has emerged as the front-runner to
succeed Kim Dae Jung as president of South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   Defying all predictions, 56-year-old lawyer Roh Mu Hyun has surged in
polls in the last few weeks and is now shown as beating his closest rival
by 11 to 26 percentage points. So precipitous has his rise been that the
political pundits have nicknamed the phenomenon the Roh poong--the Roh
tempest.</LD>
<LD>   Although it is still early in the campaign--the election is scheduled
for Dec. 19--Roh's sudden emergence turns much of the conventional wisdom
about South Korean politics on its head. It had been widely assumed that
the next president would be conservative opposition leader Lee Hoi Chang,
who would likely put the brakes on Kim's Nobel Peace Prize-winning
"sunshine policy" of dialogue with North Korea.</LD>
<TE>   Roh is widely considered the most left-leaning of half a dozen
contenders for the presidency. A self-educated lawyer from Pusan, he made
his mark representing students and workers in the 1980s struggles against
South Korea's military dictatorship. As recently as 1990, he supported
calls for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, a stance that
practically defines the left in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of his new role as front-runner, Roh says that his views have
moderated since his days as a dissident lawyer and that he now supports
the presence of the 37,000 troops stationed here.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a man of dogma or ideology. You have to make concessions as a
responsible politician. If you are too principled, it is not possible to
govern. The main principle you have to respect is never to lie," Roh said
this month as he sat in a back room at the Inchon University stadium,
awaiting the results of the 10th in a series of 16 primaries being held
by the ruling Millennium Democratic Party to select its candidate.</TE>
<TE>A Self-Taught Man</TE>
<TE>   In his first interview since becoming front-runner, Roh said he would
follow many of Kim's policies, engaging North Korea in dialogue and, on
the domestic front, continuing with privatization and a series of
economic reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Roh has a calm and reassuring speaking manner, though his nervous
energy is betrayed by hands continually in motion. The third son in a
poor family--his father grew persimmons--Roh never attended high school
or college but nonetheless passed the bar examination by educating
himself. Despite the lack of formal schooling, he has a professorial
aura. He has written three books, one of them about his political idol,
Abraham Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   "I am envious of American democracy. I have a very high opinion of the
values on which America was founded," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Roh is virtually unknown outside South Korea, and in fact has
hardly left the country, he gained prominence in Pusan as a human rights
lawyer in the 1980s. Among his clients were students who staged a 1982
attack on the U.S. Information Service offices in Pusan to protest
American policy on the Korean peninsula; those tortured for protesting
the military dictatorship; and a student who was prosecuted for traveling
illegally to the North. He was eventually tapped by the political
opposition and in 1988 was elected to the National Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, however, Roh broke with Kim Young Sam, an opposition figure
who later became president. Roh protested that a political deal between
Kim and the conservative party then in power was tantamount to a betrayal
of principles. The stand cost him politically--he ran for mayor of Pusan
in 1995 and lost--but earned him a reputation as that rare species, a
politician of principle.</TE>
<TE>   The reputation was enhanced by his personal history. Madly in love
with the daughter of a man who had died in prison for his Communist
sympathies, he married her in defiance of his family, who warned that the
marriage would destroy his career.</TE>
<TE>   "He is known as a man of loyalty. That's more important than
experience," said Choo Mi Ae, 43, a former judge who was campaigning for
Roh last weekend at the Inchon primary.</TE>
<TE>   Actually what might be most important for Roh is a quirk of South
Korean geopolitics: He comes from the Gyeongsang region, where he
commands strong support despite the area's reputation for political
conservatism, but he also draws a following from the traditionally
left-leaning province of Cholla, home of President Kim. Although it
sounds trivial, it is the most likely explanation for Roh's meteoric
success in a political climate under the sway of regional rivalries that
are as fierce as tribal warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Snyder, Seoul representative of the Asia Foundation, calls Roh
the first serious presidential candidate who is clearly of the postwar
generation, referring to the Korean War, which ended in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leader Lee, 66, "is part of the generation struggling to
survive and to thrive economically after the war," Snyder said. "Roh Mu
Hyun's experience was defined more by the struggle against
authoritarianism. He's of that next generation that had to fight for
political freedom, and that generation has a much freer, more relaxed and
progressive outlook on the world."</TE>
<TE>   Another reason that a relative newcomer like Roh can succeed is that
the new primary system, modeled after the one in the United States, has
opened the field. In the past, candidates were tapped in back rooms by
party leaders.</TE>
<TE>Cheers and Mudslinging</TE>
<TE>   The primaries now are raucous affairs, American-style, with plenty of
balloons, cheerleaders, loud music. At Inchon, a working-class port
outside Seoul, the capital, the primary was held in a sports auditorium,
with supporters dressed in the colors of their favored
candidate--sometimes wearing masks of their candidates--cheering from the
bleachers above the basketball court.</TE>
<TE>   The new primaries have been accompanied by another American
phenomenon: mudslinging, which, though certainly familiar in South Korean
elections, is reaching new heights. Roh has been denounced in various
bits of colorful lingo as an extremist, a radical and a Bolshevik.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Roh has been in a virtual state of war with South
Korea's more conservative newspapers, which have accused him of a plan to
nationalize the press. Rhee In Jae, the former ruling party front-runner
who was forced to drop out of the primaries last week because of Roh's
surge in popularity, has accused President Kim of manipulating the
primaries to help Roh's candidacy. Others are examining Roh's old
statements, trying to show that he intends to reverse privatization in
deference to the unions and to dismantle large corporations.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems politically very radical, considering some of his
statements," said Chung Hyong Kun, a conservative assemblyman and a
staunch supporter of Lee. "I won't say that I wasn't surprised by this
surge of support for Roh, but such a sudden rise could also end up with
an abrupt descent. . . . I think one factor is a sense of fatigue with
the long-standing perception that Lee Hoi Chang is the only viable choice
for the next president. However, as time goes by, people will
coolheadedly assess and judge who is qualified."</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to boost its own image as a party of democracy, Lee's
Grand National Party is also holding a series of primaries, though it is
considered unlikely that anyone could beat Lee for the nomination. The
party's primaries will begin Saturday in Inchon and are expected to wrap
up next month.</TE>

<HD>A Year Later, Koizumi Loses Luster</HD>
<DH>Japan: The prime minister, who swept into office with high ratings,
failed to focus on the economy amid Cabinet disputes, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>As Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi marks his first
anniversary in office today, the once-dashing figure who stormed into
power with 80% popularity ratings, an open style and a sense of promise
reminiscent of the early Kennedy years finds himself more and more
beleaguered on all sides.</LD>
<LD>   The continued confusion has implications well beyond Nagatacho,
Japan's political center. Not only does it delay the day when the world's
second-largest economy might once again pull its weight and contribute to
global prosperity, but it also dashes the hopes of many ordinary Japanese
that someone can lead them out of the last decade of economic, political
and social difficulties.</LD>
<LD>   It's too early to write off Koizumi. A strong showing Sunday in two
closely watched local by-elections could give him a much-needed boost.
But increasingly, the leader once dubbed the "lion" is looking more like
a house cat, just another in a long string of ineffectual Japanese
leaders.</LD>
<TE>   "There were such high expectations when Koizumi took over," said
Hirokazu Matsumoto, an independent political and foreign relations
analyst. "Now people are hugely disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Turning around the economy, getting a grip on a corrupt political
system, banishing deeply rooted vested interests and tackling numerous
social problems--to name just a few of Japan's hurdles--would be a
herculean task for any politician.</TE>
<TE>   But Koizumi squandered his political capital and made key mistakes,
analysts say, failing to keep his eye on the central issue affecting his
supporters--the economy--even as he was increasingly diverted by Cabinet
disputes and intrigue within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP.</TE>
<TE>   When he has focused on economic and financial issues, the prime
minister has left some questioning the depth of his knowledge. "Koizumi
doesn't understand economics," said independent political analyst Minoru
Morita, citing the prime minister's dogged defense of spending limits
during a deep recession.</TE>
<TE>   The 60-year-old bachelor leader also underestimated the importance of
winning at least one significant economic reform battle early on, in
order to send a signal that he meant business, keep his adversaries on
the defensive and create momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Instead he tried to tackle a number of issues at once--including
postal reform, public works, the medical system, bloated
quasi-governmental organizations and the tax system--without
accomplishing much.</TE>
<TE>   For a third-generation LDP politician long exposed to back-room
dealing, he has also shown relatively little savvy in battling the old
guard adversaries in his party--arguably his greatest enemies. Politics
in any country is a messy business. But Japan--with its ingrained
tradition of payoffs, slush funds and single-party rule--plays a
particularly vicious game of hardball.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say it's essential for any prime minister trying to change
Japan's archaic political culture to have a tough street fighter in his
or her camp adept at fighting wily bureaucrats and entrenched
politicians. Instead, Koizumi filled his Cabinet with idealists and
uninspired party hacks.</TE>
<TE>   The leader was also hit with some bad timing as the economy
deteriorated far faster than expected after Sept. 11, emboldening old
guard critics who have argued against his reforms under the pretext that
more economic stimulus was the only solution.</TE>
<TE>   This and growing disenchantment have eroded his support among the
Japanese, who have seen unemployment rise to 5.3%, more companies go
bankrupt and increases in crime rates and social instability.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't live on my pension, and have real worries about the future,"
said Seiichi Sato, a 70-year-old retiree who works as a part-time
security guard in Tokyo to make ends meet. "Koizumi claims he's reforming
things. You hear him saying nice-sounding words. But he's using his
mouth, not his head."</TE>
<TE>   Many observers say a turning point came with Koizumi's handling of a
visit last summer to the Yasukuni shrine, where 14 Class A war criminals
are among those memorialized.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating the firestorm of disapproval from other Asian nations
over his appearance at the memorial, Koizumi moved his visit up two days
so it would not coincide with the Aug. 15 anniversary of Japan's wartime
surrender.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise appeased almost no one, offended his conservative
supporters and, more important, sent a signal that the principled man of
action would bend under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly the public and fellow politicians started to believe that
Koizumi lacked a backbone," said Hiroshi Takaku, an independent political
analyst. "From then on, his political enemies were increasingly willing
to engage him in a game of chicken."</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened political opponents ultimately forced him in January to
sack his popular but cantankerous foreign minister, Makiko Tanaka. The
result: His approval ratings were cut nearly in half, to about 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with previous prime ministers--poll numbers for his immediate
predecessor, Yoshiro Mori, languished around 9%--Koizumi still enjoys
relatively strong popular appeal. And it's not too late for him to regain
traction, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   But he needs to move quickly, they say, by convincing ordinary
Japanese that he has a blueprint for the future.</TE>
<TE>   A cartoon in Thursday's daily Asahi Shimbun newspaper shows Koizumi
sweating profusely on a treadmill as his political rivals watch gleefully
through a window.</TE>
<TE>   "That about describes it," said Naoto Matsuda, a 49-year-old office
worker in Tokyo. "He's putting lots of effort into going forward. But
he's the only one who thinks he's getting anywhere."</TE>

<HD>30 Leave Afghanistan in First Release of Pakistani Detainees</HD>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The Afghan interim government Thursday freed the first of hundreds
of Pakistani prisoners who were locked away for months in cramped,
squalid cells because they came to help the deposed Taliban regime fight
a "holy war" against the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The first 30 Pakistanis--elderly men with white beards and younger men
who were wounded--filed into a Pakistani military plane for the flight
home, guarded by heavily armed soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan said it would detain the men until authorities could verify
that they were citizens and determine whether they committed any serious
crimes. At the very least, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed
Khan, the men crossed the border without proper documents. Khan described
the release as a humanitarian effort on behalf of innocent or misled
people.</LD>
<TE>   The prisoner release was the beginning of a mass return of Pakistanis
detained in Afghanistan late last year when the opposition Northern
Alliance, backed by a U.S.-led air campaign, drove the Taliban regime
from power.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Afghan nor Pakistani officials had a count of how many
Pakistanis were being held in Afghan jails, other than to say they
numbered in the hundreds. But an official in Islamabad, the Pakistani
capital, said 695 prisoners would be freed by Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions in Afghan prisons are often atrocious. At Sheberghan prison
in the north, where some of those released Thursday had been held,
International Committee of the Red Cross began an emergency feeding
program last weekend because some prisoners were on the verge of
starvation.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,700 prisoners at Sheberghan were packed so tightly into cells
that they had to sleep in shifts. Authorities have begun to move some
prisoners into tents.</TE>
<TE>   Interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai agreed to the release after
a request from Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   Shazada Masood, advisor to the Afghan minister of tribal and border
affairs, said none of those released appeared to have links to Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network, which the U.S. blames for the Sept.
11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "They are old men who were fighting with the Taliban. They are not
convicted of any exact crime," he said. "They were simply deceived by the
Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the United Nations' refugee agency said about 353,000
Afghan refugees have returned home since a repatriation program began
about two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Of those, 327,000 returned from Pakistan, 17,000 from Iran, more than
8,900 from Tajikistan and 18 from Turkmenistan, said the Office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Some refugees have been living in exile since the Soviet Union's 1979
invasion of Afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>Milosevic's Army Chief Surrenders</HD>
<DH>Yugoslavia: Dragoljub Ojdanic turns himself in to the U.N. war
crimes tribunal in The Hague.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>Yugoslavia's former army commander turned himself in to the U.N.
war crimes tribunal here Thursday, insisting that he has "a clear
conscience."</LD>
<LD>   Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, 60, is the first of six indictees to make good
on a pledge to surrender rather than be arrested and extradited to the
court in the Netherlands. He is the most senior Yugoslav army officer to
face war crimes charges at the court.</LD>
<LD>   Ojdanic flew from Belgrade to Amsterdam on a regular Yugoslav Airlines
flight accompanied by a lawyer and his wife, who wept as he was taken
into custody.</LD>
<TE>   The former chief of staff was indicted in May 1999 with former
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is now on trial. Ojdanic faces
five counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or
customs of war, punishable by up to life imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Ojdanic is accused of ordering attacks on ethnic Albanian villages in
Kosovo between January and June 1999. He will plead not guilty at his
initial appearance today, according to one of his lawyers, Tomislav
Visnjic. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.</TE>
<TE>   Visnjic declined to comment on whether his client would testify
against Milosevic.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing to be ashamed of," Ojdanic said shortly before
surrendering. "I have a clear conscience."</TE>
<TE>   He joined 40 other suspects at the U.N. detention center in a seaside
suburb of The Hague.</TE>

<HD>Fraud Goes Through (Mansion) Roof, Georgians Say</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: Homes selling for upward of $3 million attract poorly
paid government officials as owners, adding to complaints of corruption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TBILISI, Georgia
</DL>
<LD>There is a suburb going up here filled with fantastic towers of
brick and steel, the kitschy dream homes of current and former officials
who could not afford to buy on their government salaries alone.</LD>
<LD>   The price tags: between $3 million and $4 million.</LD>
<LD>   That officials on meager state salaries--the head of government,
President Eduard A. Shevardnadze, makes only $190 a month--are buying
these homes is evidence, say Georgian analysts and journalists, of
colossal corruption.</LD>
<TE>   Georgia has absorbed about $900 million in U.S. aid during the last
five years, and the mansions raise disturbing questions about the value
of pouring dollars into a corrupt system.</TE>
<TE>   "The result of that aid in almost any sphere, except food aid, is very
hard to detect. One reason is incompetence of post-Soviet structures, but
corruption played an enormous role," said Anatol Lieven, a senior
associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in
Washington, who is writing a book on Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   In the post-Soviet era, Georgia was anointed by the West as a likely
candidate for future North Atlantic Treaty Organization membership, a
stable pipeline route for Western companies' oil and a reliable ally to
counterbalance Russian power in the region.</TE>
<TE>Disappointing Progress</TE>
<TE>   But its progress toward democratic institutions and a market economy
has been disappointing. The divide between rich bureaucrats and the mass
of disgruntled, impoverished Georgians is wider than ever.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest symbol of Georgia's failure to establish a stable
democracy was the April 2000 presidential election, which was sharply
criticized at the time by monitors from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe as fraught with balloting violations. The vote,
which kept Shevardnadze in office, rocked Western faith in the country's
ability to reform.</TE>
<TE>   In the grand new Tbilisi suburb, the houses jostle the eye, competing
for height as though a mob of frustrated Soviet architects had run amok.
But don't wander too close or ask too many questions about the owners, a
foreman at the construction site of one home warned journalists last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "A brick might fall on your head. We wouldn't want that," he growled.
"Now get out of here. I'm fed up with you."</TE>
<TE>   The story of the house that Tbilisi police chief Iosif Alavidze built
shows the lines of patronage in Georgian society, and the point at which
these fray and snap.</TE>
<TE>   In a controversy over the mansion's construction last spring, Alavidze
drew support from his boss, Interior Minister Kakha Targamadze, a
Shevardnadze loyalist. Insisting that there was no evidence of
corruption, Targamadze argued that the mansion was not registered in the
name of Alavidze but the chief's relatives.</TE>
<TE>   But Targamadze would not last long in his post. Nor would Alavidze,
nor some of his neighbors in the exclusive new suburb, such as Security
Minister Vakhtang Kutateladze and his deputy, Simon Nozadze.</TE>
<TE>   Alavidze resigned last summer, after photos of his and Kutateladze's
mansions were brandished in a government meeting by Justice Minister
Mikheil Saakashvili, an ambitious young populist who made his name
campaigning against corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Saakashvili was the next to go, resigning in anger a month later and
accusing Shevardnadze of failing to tackle corruption.</TE>
<TE>   The clamor for action reached a head last fall. Angry street protests
called for the resignation of government leaders after agents from the
Ministry of Security, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB, attempted to
raid independent television station Rustavi 2, which specializes in
airing exposes on state corruption.</TE>
<TE>Entire Cabinet Sacked</TE>
<TE>   Shevardnadze, weakened and unpopular, was forced to accept the
resignations of Kutateladze, who had ordered the raid, and Targamadze.
The president then sacked the entire Cabinet, though many of the
ministers were reappointed. Nozadze later stepped down.</TE>
<TE>   The shake-up cheered Georgia's anti-corruption campaigners and brought
significant change to the upper echelons of the Ministry of Security,
with a new and more open generation sweeping in.</TE>
<TE>   But despite these positive signs, many analysts see the steps as too
little too late.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Rondeli, director of the Georgian Foundation for Strategic
and International Studies, a think tank here, said the public wants an
end to corruption in the Interior and Security ministries and has been
disappointed by Shevardnadze's lack of action.</TE>
<TE>   "If you promise to do something a second time and fail, people's trust
is completely exhausted," he said. "Shevardnadze started some changes but
could not or did not want to continue them."</TE>
<TE>   Rondeli said that the reforms at the Ministry of Security were
encouraging but that the changes at the Interior Ministry were limited to
the minister's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "People have more contact with the Interior Ministry in life," he
said. "It's the police, the law. People want to feel some tangible
change."</TE>
<TE>   The president's critics argue that the superficiality of his fight
against corruption sends pessimistic signals about Georgia's prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Amid growing criticism, Shevardnadze relies for his survival on U.S.
support, and the fact that there is no obvious figure to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   In October, he negotiated an agreement with President Bush to bring
American soldiers here to train and equip a Georgian anti-terrorist
force. The deal is popular with Georgians.</TE>
<TE>   Shevardnadze is respected in the West as the former Soviet foreign
minister who helped end the Cold War, but his approval rating among
Georgians hovered at just 9% in recent opinion polls.</TE>
<TE>   The problem of corruption is deeply rooted. When Georgia was under
Russian control in czarist and Soviet times, it was almost a point of
honor to get around regulations laid down a thousand or more miles away.
But this eroded respect for the law.</TE>
<TE>   "This contempt for Soviet law has produced a kind of nihilism and a
contempt for all laws, even though they're now the laws of an independent
country," said Lieven, the analyst.</TE>
<TE>   The family is the bedrock of Georgian culture, and people rely on
powerful clan figures for protection, jobs, favors and goods or services.</TE>
<TE>   "The family takes precedence over everything else, including the law,"
Lieven said. "If everybody's loyalty is to their family, and the junior
officials see the senior officials are themselves plundering the state,
it becomes terribly difficult to create an ethic of national patriotism."</TE>
<TE>   Journalists who criticize Shevardnadze, such as Akaki Gogichaishvili,
anchor of Rustavi 2's investigative program "60 Minutes," tend to get
angry calls from the president's wife, Nanuli. (The program is not
related to the U.S. show of the same name.)</TE>
<TE>   Gogichaishvili says he has received anonymous death threats for his
reports, which often implicate officials in corruption. He alleges that
he received such threats in June 2000 from the prosecutor general's
office, an accusation denied by the agency. Once, the brakes on his car
were tampered with, the journalist says, and recently, he adds, someone
fired a shot through the window of his office, which was unoccupied at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Gogichaishvili believes that it was a warning shot to scare his team
off as they prepared a report on a Georgian army colonel who for years
allegedly had funneled Russian arms to criminals in the lawless Pankisi
Gorge, in northeastern Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   The program was aired recently. The colonel has not been arrested or
charged.</TE>
<TE>   Rustavi 2 journalist Georgi Sanaya was slain in July while
investigating suspected links between government officials and criminals
in the gorge.</TE>
<TE>   Valery Khaburdzania, the current security minister, has opened an
investigation into claims that officials from the Interior Ministry or
other agencies cooperated with criminals or Chechen rebels based in the
gorge.</TE>
<TE>   Gogichaishvili argues that Shevardnadze had no real base of support
when he came to power and that he won the loyalty of officials by turning
a blind eye as they grew rich through corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "So there's really no way that Shevardnadze would fight against
corruption," he said. "During all the years of the fight against
corruption, there has not been a single person who has been charged or
jailed."</TE>

<HD>Israel, U.N. Start Talks on Role of Jenin Mission</HD>

<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Negotiations with Israel over a U.N. investigation into its
three-week occupation of the Jenin refugee camp got underway here late
Thursday and will resume today, U.N. officials said, as the fact-finding
team prepares to leave for the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli delegation, arriving for talks at the U.N. Secretariat,
said it hoped to be able to resolve its concerns about the U.N.
mission--and to avert another Security Council meeting on the issue.</LD>
<LD>   Arab nations, with some European and Latin American support, submitted
a draft resolution to the council demanding Israel's cooperation with the
inquiry into the campaign in the West Bank camp but agreed to defer
debate on the proposal until after the Israeli-U.N. talks here.</LD>
<TE>   "They are down there hoping that this will fail," said an Israeli
official, who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   But Nasser Kidwa, the Palestinian representative at the United
Nations, said reports from U.N. officials indicated that they were
"making good progress."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli and U.N. officials would not comment on Thursday's
discussions.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli Foreign Ministry had given its approval to the
fact-finding mission last week but then requested its postponement or
cancellation Tuesday. The team is scheduled to leave today for the
region.</TE>
<TE>   In talks Thursday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan agreed to add two
military advisors to the fact-finding team--a key Israeli request--but
said the U.N. will not postpone the probe, according to spokesman Fred
Eckhard.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials objected to some people named to the Jenin mission
and to what they contend is its excessively broad mandate, which they
said could be interpreted to include other West Bank military operations.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Convict 4 in Assassination</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY
</DL>
<LD>In a makeshift courtroom Thursday, Palestinian officials hastily
convicted and sentenced to prison four men in the killing of an Israeli
Cabinet minister, steps taken in a bid to alleviate Israel's siege on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   Acting inside Arafat's battered and surrounded headquarters in the
West Bank city of Ramallah, a military officer took less than a day to
pronounce the men guilty of violating Palestinian national interests.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli officials immediately dismissed the procedure as a sham and
reiterated their demand that the men be extradited to Israel. Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said it was too bad they would have to be
tried twice.</LD>
<TE>   "They will anyway be brought to trial in Israel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians had hoped that by trying the suspects, who have been
holed up in Arafat's compound for weeks, Israel would ease its siege. The
blockade of Arafat's headquarters and the standoff between the Israeli
army and Palestinian gunmen at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity remain
the two most volatile unresolved remnants of Israel's massive three-week
West Bank offensive.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday's proceedings appeared to satisfy virtually no one.</TE>
<TE>   The men were accused of assassinating Rehavam Zeevi, Israel's
conservative tourism minister. He was shot three times at a hotel in East
Jerusalem in October.</TE>
<TE>   The convicted men are militants from the radical Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a leading faction of Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization. The PFLP claimed that it was avenging Israel's
earlier assassination of the faction's leader, Mustafa Zibri, better
known as Abu Ali Mustafa.</TE>
<TE>   Zeevi's slaying was the first of a top Israeli political official by
Palestinians, and it sent shock waves through Israel. Sharon sent tanks
into Bethlehem to pressure Arafat to arrest the suspects, then surrounded
his headquarters in December because the Palestinian Authority president
had failed to act. In thinly veiled threats, Sharon has let it be known
that he is considering storming the compound to seize the men.</TE>
<TE>   Videotape released by the Palestinian Authority showed the four men
flanked by armed guards at their trial. They appeared gaunt and unshaven.
One of the men, Ahed Ghoulmi, sat in a wheelchair, his leg bandaged.</TE>
<TE>   Ghoulmi, who heads the military wing of the PFLP, was sentenced to one
year in prison. Israel accuses him of ordering the killing, along with
the head of the faction, Ahmed Saadat, who was not tried.</TE>
<TE>   The convicted triggerman, Hamdi Quran, was sentenced to 18 years of
hard labor. The lookout, Basel Asmar, received 12 years, and the getaway
driver, Majdi Rimawi, eight.</TE>
<TE>   The videotape shows the men being led away. It is unclear where they
might serve their sentences, because most Palestinian jails have been
destroyed in Israeli attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Under interim peace accords, Israel can demand the extradition of
suspects, but the Palestinians can avoid that by prosecuting them in
their own courts.</TE>
<TE>   The PFLP condemned the convictions as a farce that brings shame on the
Palestinian people. In Gaza City, at the school of three 14-year-olds who
were killed this week by the Israeli army as they reportedly tried to
attack a Jewish settlement, teachers hailed the convicted men as heroes
who should be freed.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't they try the ones who killed Abu Ali Mustafa?" Principal
Basem Wahidi asked.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis, however, were dismissive of what Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer termed a show trial. Israel has accused the PFLP of car
bombings and other attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an Israeli minister killed in Israel, and it is Israel that
must put them on trial," said Tzipi Livni, minister without portfolio.
"There is no justice system there [in the Palestinian territories],
unless you call justice the lynching of people who helped Israel."</TE>
<TE>   She was referring to the recent slayings by Palestinian vigilantes of
alleged collaborators with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Zeevi's son, Yiftah-Palmach Zeevi, similarly decried Thursday's action
as an "imaginary trial that made a mockery of the state of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   "The assassination of a minister in the capital city--that is a blow
to Israel's sovereignty," he said. "I demand that the killers be brought
to trial in Israel, no matter in what condition."</TE>

<HD>Palestinians at Nativity Church Demand Meeting With Arafat</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Nine teens leave the complex, and two bodies are removed.
Both sides express optimism that a resolution to the long standoff is
near.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Negotiations toward a peaceful end to the three-week siege at the
Church of the Nativity hit a stumbling block late Thursday as encircled
Palestinians demanded a meeting with their equally besieged leader,
Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear whether the Israelis would permit such a meeting.
However, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon indicated that he might loosen
restrictions on the Palestinian leader, who is trapped by Israeli forces
in his compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah.</LD>
<LD>   "We hope we will get a positive answer any time," said Salah Tamari,
the lead Palestinian negotiator, adding that talks would not continue
without such a consultation. "It is crucial to meet Arafat."</LD>
<TE>   Nine teenagers and the bodies of two men were brought out of the
church Thursday afternoon, a minor breakthrough that had both sides
predicting a resolution soon to the crisis at one of Christianity's
holiest places.</TE>
<TE>   "There is very cautious optimism that the affair is closer to an end
today than it was yesterday," Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey, the Israeli
military's chief spokesman, told Army Radio.</TE>
<TE>   More than 140 Palestinians took shelter in the church when the Israeli
army advanced into Bethlehem on April 2 as part of its West Bank
offensive. Israel believes that about 30 are armed militants.</TE>
<TE>   About 80 priests, nuns and monks were trapped with the Palestinians at
the site, a large compound that tradition holds marks the site of Jesus'
birth.</TE>
<TE>   The status of those in the church has remained unclear. The Israelis
insist that at least some of the church leaders and Palestinians are
being held hostage. Those inside, as well as some who have left, have
denied the charge.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have remained in a tense standoff, exchanging fire
several times. The most recent incident came Wednesday, when an Israeli
soldier was injured and a Palestinian fighter was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Tension in the church has risen in recent days, as food and water
supplies have dwindled. More than 30 people, including several priests,
have fled during the standoff, according to the Israeli military.</TE>
<TE>   The primary sticking point remains the fate of those inside whom the
Israelis consider terrorists. Israel wants to try the men or have them
deported to another country. Palestinians have proposed sending them to
the Gaza Strip, but those in the church say that some of the gunmen are
rejecting even that option. In Gaza, the men might be an easy target for
informants or Israeli security strikes.</TE>
<TE>   One issue was resolved Thursday with the removal of the two bodies.
Palestinians said the men were shot by snipers. The Israelis declined to
comment on how they died but have said that troops fire only on armed men
in the church.</TE>
<TE>   About 3 p.m., nine teenage boys were seen leaving the church, their
faces covered with white surgical masks. Israeli soldiers fired smoke
grenades that obscured the view of the scene, but at one point the youths
could be seen carrying two coffins toward an ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers were held for questioning by Israeli security forces,
then released late Thursday. The army said they were given food and
medical care.</TE>
<TE>   One teen, Abdulhay abu Srur, 17, appeared worn and tired after his
release. He said the church smelled horrible and was badly damaged from
the firefights.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Palestinians still inside are police officers armed with
machine guns, he said, and morale remains high despite the problems.
Those inside have rejected exile as an option, Abu Srur said, adding,
"Life inside the church is a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Srur said he had been eating only lemon peels for days and had lost
more than 30 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   His weight loss seemed confirmed a few moments later when he walked up
the steps of the crowded tenement where his family lives in a refugee
camp in nearby Beit Jala. His mother shouted out when she saw him. "My
son was as big as a camel!" she said. "Look at him now!"</TE>
<TE>   The two badly decomposed bodies arrived at a nearby hospital in crude
wooden boxes. One coffin appeared to have been built from particle board,
the other from burned pieces of wood.</TE>
<TE>   Abir Nasman, the wife of one of the dead men, broke down in sobs when
the coffins arrived. She said her husband, Hassan, was a policeman who
had sought safety in the church during the Israeli invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Abir Nasman, who lost her first husband in another confrontation with
Israeli troops, said the 23-year-old policeman was not a militant. During
their final telephone call the day before he was shot two weeks ago, he
asked about his two daughters, ages 1 and 2.</TE>
<TE>   Nasman, 24, said her husband had died for the Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   "As a Muslim, there is a saying in the Koran: 'Whoever enters a holy
place is safe,' " said Siham Massalmeh, 44, Hassan Nasman's
mother-in-law. "How is it possible that my son-in-law was killed in a
house of God?"</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Energy Bill Linked to Conservation</HD>
<DH>Congress: Critics say it won't substantially reduce U.S. dependence
on oil. House version tilts to more production.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate approved a bill Thursday that would revamp the nation's
energy policy, paving the way for talks with the House on one of
President Bush's domestic priorities.</LD>
<LD>   The bill is a mix of relatively modest steps geared more toward
promoting conservation and the use of alternative power sources. The
House bill, taking its cue from Bush, is tilted more toward increasing
production.</LD>
<LD>   Left out of the Senate bill were two high-profile items: oil and gas
drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that is sought by
Bush, and tougher vehicle miles-per-gallon standards that
environmentalists want. Those defeats reflect the difficulty of passing
sweeping legislation in a narrowly divided Congress, and many were
disappointed by the final form of the Senate legislation.</LD>
<TE>   Critics say it falls short of the goal of substantially reducing U.S.
dependence on oil, terming it a step in the right direction but not a
leap. But after six weeks of often-acrimonious debate, the Senate
approved the bill overwhelmingly, 88 to 11.</TE>
<TE>   Both California senators, Democrats Barbara Boxer and Dianne
Feinstein, were among those opposing the measure. They say a provision
requiring ethanol to be added to gasoline would spike prices at the pump.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is packed with a wide range of measures. These include a
federal loan guarantee to spur construction of a $20-billion, 2,100-mile
pipeline to carry Alaska natural gas to the Lower 48 states and a
requirement that utilities generate more electricity from alternative
sources, such as sun and wind. It offers close to $15 billion in tax
incentives, roughly evenly divided between conservation and production
measures.</TE>
<TE>   It extends a cap on the nuclear industry's liability in accidents, a
provision designed to remove an obstacle to expansion of nuclear power.
It sets new energy efficiency standards for traffic lights. And it allows
states to let solo drivers of part-electric, part-fuel hybrid vehicles
use carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate vote came more than a year after rolling power blackouts in
California and energy price hikes throughout the country propelled energy
policy to the top of the Washington agenda. More recently, political
instability in the Middle East has underscored the issue's importance.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, an ex-oilman, unveiled a national energy plan in May that called
for expanding nuclear power, spending $2 billion for research on "clean
coal" technologies and opening more federal land to oil and gas
exploration, including parts of the Arctic refuge. The plan also included
some environmentally friendly measures, such as tax incentives for
residential solar power and fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles. Most of those
measures are in the House bill passed in August.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said Thursday that he looks forward to working with House and
Senate negotiators to produce a compromise bill. "It is imperative that
America increase its energy independence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has said the Senate bill does too little to promote
domestic production.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America echoed that
complaint, saying the measure falls "far short" of the domestic energy
production incentives in the House bill. But the group praised the Senate
bill for including tax credits for small, independent power producers.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental and consumer groups adamantly opposed to the House bill
had a range of criticisms about the Senate version. They charged it would
do little to promote cleaner fuels or to reduce global warming.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress should go back to the drawing board," said Anna Aurilio,
legislative director for the Public Interest Research Group, founded by
consumer advocate Ralph Nader.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) defended the Senate, saying that,
while it was "far from perfect, it's far and away better than the
disastrous effort put forward by the House."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry cited provisions that would take initial steps toward addressing
climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which scientists believe
contribute to global warming. A compromise plan agreed to Thursday would
set up a voluntary inventory of greenhouse gases and a registry for
companies that reduce their emissions of the gases. This registry would
be used to give companies credit for early reductions in any future
programs that call for cutting such emissions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more activity than we've seen on climate change in the
Congress, I think, ever, which is a very positive sign," said Eileen
Claussen, executive director of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change,
which works with companies that want to address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Republican-led House and Democratic-controlled Senate
said they are eager to strike a deal on a final bill.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, said he looks forward to negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill would permit oil drilling in the Arctic refuge. House
Republicans have said they plan to push for Arctic drilling, but Senate
Democrats are unlikely to accept any bill that includes it.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate measure calls for close to $15 billion in tax incentives to
promote conservation and production, compared with $33 billion in the
House version.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill does not include the provision--popular in the
politically important Midwest--to triple the amount of ethanol added to
gasoline to 5 billion gallons annually by 2012. But ethanol, made mostly
from corn, enjoys widespread support in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   In last-ditch efforts to alter the Senate bill, lawmakers rejected an
effort Thursday to include a measure seeking to limit the growth in oil
consumption by motor vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmakers also stripped the bill of a measure that would have
restored tougher Clinton-era efficiency standards for air conditioners
that were rolled backed by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   And they defeated a Feinstein move to delay by one year, until 2005,
the start date for adding ethanol to gasoline. Feinstein contended that
gas prices will rise because of the additional cost of bringing ethanol
from the Midwest to California. Ethanol advocates dispute that.</TE>
<TE>   "When the price of gasoline does spike and people are calling, I will
refer them to your office, senator," Feinstein said, scolding Sen.
Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) after he extolled the virtues of ethanol.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer said the bill does "more harm than good for the people of
California." Along with opposing the ethanol provision, she complained
about the Senate's rejection of a measure she said would have protected
consumers from gouging in electricity markets.</TE>
<TE>   Voting for the bill were 42 Democrats, 45 Republicans and independent
James M. Jeffords of Vermont. Opposing it were eight Democrats and three
Republicans.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Building Blast Injures 42</HD>
<DH>Explosion: Chemicals used by a sign company tenant are blamed.
Early terrorism fears led to radiation testing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A massive explosion caused by volatile chemicals ripped through a
Manhattan commercial building Thursday, scattering sheets of glass and
debris on the streets below and injuring 42 people, 12 critically.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the blast, which badly damaged the facade of a 10-story
structure in the Chelsea neighborhood, appeared to be an accident.</LD>
<LD>   But in a sign of the times--with worries about terrorism--victims who
were taken to hospitals were screened for exposure to radiation, just in
case.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no reason at this point to think there's anything suspicious
about this explosion," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said. "There were
volatile chemicals in the basement of this building, [and] a sign company
was using these chemicals."</TE>
<TE>   The explosion, which rocked the busy commercial neighborhood,
triggered mass evacuations of surrounding buildings and caused widespread
alarm in the area, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 firefighters rushed to the building on West 19th Street,
where investigators determined the blast originated in the basement near
the boiler room. New York Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said the
sign company, which some officials identified as Kaltech Co., recently
received shipments of acetone in 50-gallon drums. But he did not say
specifically what caused the blast.</TE>
<TE>   "The company does etching and uses very volatile materials to do that
etching," Scoppetta said. "We're still looking into possible links."</TE>
<TE>   The late-morning blast rattled nerves in a neighborhood that is only a
few miles from where the World Trade Center stood.</TE>
<TE>   "At first we all thought the worst, this might be a terrorist thing,
and nobody wants to go through that after 9/11," said Xanias Patterson, a
shop teacher in an adjacent building that was quickly emptied after the
explosion. "People were very scared, and the main goal was to get
everybody outside as quickly as possible."</TE>
<TE>   As police, fire and other emergency vehicles arrived, scores of dazed,
injured people sat on the sidewalks--some bleeding profusely from head
wounds and other injuries. Scores of evacuees stood nearby, gasping for
air after running down stairwells to the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a giant boom . . . it sounded like an airplane crashing." said
Bill Beek, who lives nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The deafening blast, which shook the narrow block between 6th and 7th
avenues, blew out office windows up and down the street and damaged
scores of parked cars. As a driving rain fell, traffic was tied up for
hours and power was cut off in the area at the Fire Department's request.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't help but be scared, at least at first," said Peter
Molina, who works in a building next to the sign company. "Especially
since some of the people who were sitting on the street were badly hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Six of those victims were taken to nearby St. Vincent's Hospital,
where doctors said they had life-threatening burns and broken bones.</TE>
<TE>   New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center treated eight
patients, including four in critical but stable condition. At Cabrini
Medical Center, doctors were treating three people with minor injuries; a
fourth was in intensive care with chest pains. All those badly hurt had
been standing outside the building when the explosion occurred, and some
were hit by falling glass.</TE>
<TE>   At Bellevue Hospital, four people were treated and released, and two
others were kept for observation.</TE>
<TE>   "Just when you think the city is beginning to calm down, this
happens," said John Heffernen, who rushed out of a nearby actors' studio
after the blast. "I guess everybody's still jumpy in New York."</TE>

<LD>They're getting hung out to dry in Southampton, N.Y. Folks there
who put clotheslines up in their frontyards now face fines of as much as
$1,000--even possible jail time.</LD>
<LD>   A zoning code amendment was passed Tuesday, drawing praise from those
who believe that nighties and knickers should be kept out of sight, and
grumbles from those who say line-drying should be encouraged because it's
more environmentally friendly than electric dryers.</LD>
<LD>   Lindy Michaud said the rule is meant to please wealthy summer
residents. For full-time residents like herself, it doesn't make any
sense, she says. "What do they care how I dry my laundry? When they buy
me a dryer and pay my electric bill, I'll take my clothes off the line."</LD>

<DL>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.
</DL>
<LD>A man serving jail time for trying to abduct a female bicyclist
pleaded not guilty Thursday in the slashing deaths of two female hikers
in a federal park.</LD>
<LD>   Darrell David Rice, 34, of Columbia, Md., is charged with four counts
of capital murder in the 1996 slayings. Laura Winans, 26, and Julianne
Williams, 24, were found bound and gagged at a secluded campsite in
Shenandoah National Park along the Appalachian Trail.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators described Rice as a violent misogynist who told the
women they "deserved to die because they were lesbian," according to
court documents.</LD>
<TE>   Fred Heblich, Rice's lawyer, would not comment on specifics of the
case Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Rice pleaded guilty to an unrelated abduction charge for
trying to force a bicyclist into his truck and attempting to run her
over. He was sentenced to 136 months in prison.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutors Rebuff Moussaoui's Bid for Meeting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Zacarias Moussaoui, the man indicted as a Sept. 11 accomplice,
tried to speak with prosecutors about the death penalty and classified
information but they refused, the government said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said they were informed of the request Tuesday by a jail
official, an indication that Moussaoui, who wants to represent himself in
the case, is already trying to do so.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui, however, cannot make that decision on his own. U.S.
District Judge Leonie Brinkema said she will rule after Moussaoui, a
French citizen, has a mental examination.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui's court-appointed lawyers, who remain in the case, were told
of the request by government attorneys and have asked Brinkema not to
allow the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   They submitted a pleading Thursday contending the government misread
the law by making this a death penalty case.</TE>
<TE>   In a written motion, prosecutors said, "Although we believed that it
would be legally permissible for us to speak with the defendant, we would
not have contact . . . without defense counsel present or without
permission from the court."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui asked Monday to represent himself, said he prayed for the
destruction of the United States and Israel, and accused his lawyers of
conspiring with the government for his execution.</TE>
<TE>   The request for a meeting with prosecutors demonstrates the
complications set in motion by his request, given the extensive
classified information in the case.</TE>
<TE>   If Moussaoui is allowed to represent himself, Brinkema would have to
decide how to handle secret material that normally would be provided to
defense lawyers with security clearances.</TE>
<TE>   The government has said it would seek Moussaoui's execution if he is
convicted of conspiring with the 19 hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment says his activities mirrored those of the attackers,
including taking flying lessons and expressing an interest in crop
dusters.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested in Minnesota when authorities became suspicious of his
conduct. He was in custody Sept. 11.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>A 2,400-acre wildfire sent thick smoke across wooded foothills
southwest of Denver on Thursday as firefighters labored in cooler weather
to protect hundreds of homes.</LD>
<LD>   Cloud cover, lighter wind and lower temperatures provided relief for
about 250 firefighters building lines around the blaze.</LD>
<LD>   "We're making hay," said Mike Frederick, who heads a 20-member crew
from Wilmington, Ill.</LD>
<TE>   Smoke dropped visibility at times to less than a quarter of a mile in
the area 35 miles from Denver. A barn and a shed were destroyed, but
there were no reported injuries. About 400 people remained out of their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   The fire crept within 30 feet of U.S. 285 in places. The highway
remained open, but motorists were prohibited from stopping.</TE>
<TE>   The fire started Tuesday in tinder-dry ponderosa, grass and brush in
an area popular with smokers. It spread quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Park County Sheriff Fred Wegener said three high school freshmen seen
in the area had been questioned. He said charges could be filed in the
next couple of days and two of the teens had hired attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey, a town of 4,400 people, was evacuated Wednesday afternoon and
four schools were closed when flames crept to within a quarter of a mile
of downtown. Three schools remained closed Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Most residents were allowed back in their homes by nightfall, when
cooler weather eased the fire threat, but the sheriff's department said
many areas were without electricity or water.</TE>
<TE>   A winter drought has triggered an early start to the wildfire season.</TE>

<DL>TRENTON, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>The mysterious New Jersey winner in last week's Big Game lottery
has come forward to claim his share of the $331-million jackpot, but
lottery officials said Thursday that a pool of office workers is also
laying claim to the $59-million cash prize.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously it sounds utterly confusing and convoluted, which it is,"
said Tom Rosenberg, spokesman for the state Lottery Commission, which has
launched an investigation to resolve the dispute.</LD>
<LD>   Three winning tickets were sold for the April 16 drawing, including
one in New Jersey. Erica Green, 20, has claimed the sole winning ticket
sold in Georgia. The third winner in Illinois has not yet come forward.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys for the dueling parties in New Jersey, as yet unidentified,
contacted lottery officials late Wednesday. The man's lawyer came in
person and presented the winning ticket, which officials validated,
Rosenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been validated. The winning ticket has been presented. That is
not in dispute," Rosenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The same afternoon, officials received a letter from a second attorney
claiming that his clients in the office pool had also won.</TE>
<TE>   The review "could take a day or a week," Rosenberg said. "Right now
things are very murky. Things are very cloudy."</TE>
<TE>   The winner's name will be revealed after the dispute is settled,
Rosenberg said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-GOP Chief Memo Tried to Sway Cheney on Energy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In a memo to Vice President Dick Cheney two weeks before a major
policy reversal, lobbyist and former Republican National Committee
Chairman Haley Barbour urged the Bush White House to adopt a pro-industry
stance on carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants.</LD>
<LD>   "A moment of truth is arriving," Barbour wrote Cheney on March 1,
2001, in a two-page document on his lobbying firm letterhead that was
copied to top White House officials and three Cabinet secretaries.</LD>
<LD>   "The question is whether environmental policy still prevails over
energy policy with Bush-Cheney, as it did with Clinton-Gore," Barbour
stated.</LD>
<TE>   The Commerce Department released a copy of the memo Thursday in a
court case brought by the conservative group Judicial Watch, which is
suing the Bush administration for records about White House energy
policy.</TE>
<TE>   The memo was one of thousands of pages of documents released by the
Commerce, Energy and Transportation departments.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing a policy switch two weeks after Barbour's memo, Bush went
back on a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Jimmy Orr said Bush was not unduly influenced by
the energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   In the memo, Barbour said he was "demurring" on the idea of whether
regulating carbon dioxide was "eco-extremism."</TE>
<TE>   But "we must ask, do environmental initiatives, which would greatly
exacerbate the energy problems, trump good energy policy, which the
country has lacked for eight years?" said the former RNC chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Among Barbour's 50 lobbying clients at the time was an industry
coalition, the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council.</TE>

<HD>Congress Hammers Out Preliminary Farm Bill</HD>
<DH>Policy: Negotiators agree on outline of a measure that would
increase spending on subsidies, conservation programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Breaking a stubborn impasse, House and Senate negotiators reached
agreement Thursday on the outlines of a farm bill that would vastly
increase federal spending on crop subsidies and conservation programs.</LD>
<LD>   The breakthrough came a day after President Bush traveled to South
Dakota and called on Congress to reach a quick compromise on the
legislation, which passed the House and Senate in significantly different
forms.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) announced
the agreement by negotiators, although sources familiar with the talks
cautioned that some changes were still possible, based on a pending cost
analysis.</LD>
<TE>   Negotiators want to draft a final bill that would increase spending
for farm programs--currently about $100 billion over the next 10
years--by about $73 billion. Most of the money will go to expand existing
programs that subsidize major crops such as corn, rice and cotton.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would significantly hike spending for conservation
measures. Harkin said the compromise would include a new conservation
program he had proposed, at a cost of $2 billion, which he said
represented the largest single new program under the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is rife with political significance because several of the
year's most hotly contested Senate races are in farm states, including
South Dakota. Although the House-Senate negotiations at times teetered on
the brink of collapse, neither party wanted to risk being blamed for the
failure of a bill that provides an economic lifeline to many farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators watered down a contentious provision in the Senate version
of the bill that would have slapped a firm $275,000-per-farm annual cap
on federal subsidy payments. Negotiators agreed to raise the cap to
$360,000, and leave a loophole that could allow some farmers to collect
even more.</TE>
<TE>   The stricter cap had been approved as a way to channel more funding to
small and mid-size farmers, and to dilute criticism that existing
programs concentrate too much money in the hands of big agribusinesses.</TE>
<TE>   But the cap met heavy opposition from a bipartisan coalition of
lawmakers from the South and West--including California's two Democratic
senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. These lawmakers said the
cap would disproportionately hurt cotton and rice growers, whose
subsidies are bigger because their costs are much higher than the growers
of other commodities.</TE>
<TE>   California farmers, who overall get relatively little federal aid, had
conflicting interests in the trade-off between funding larger commodity
payments and new funding for conservation and other programs. The state's
cotton and rice growers get significant federal subsidies and opposed the
cap. But growers of fruits and vegetables and other commodities not
covered by the subsidy program stood to benefit from proposed increases
in funding for conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said they were disappointed that the compromise did
not provide more for conservation programs and watered down the cap. Ken
Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said the reported
agreement was so loophole-ridden that it was toothless.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a joke," he said. "You have to ask why the Senate bothered."</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the conferees dropped a controversial provision meant to
help small livestock producers by limiting ownership of livestock by
meatpackers. That proposal was especially important to Sen. Tim Johnson
(D-S.D.), who is locked in a tough reelection fight and is a close ally
of the state's other Democratic senator, Majority Leader Tom Daschle.</TE>

<HD>House Votes to Split Up Embattled Immigration Service</HD>
<DH>Reform: The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were the catalyst for an
overhaul, which enjoys broad support in Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Capping years of frustration, the House voted Thursday to overhaul
the beleaguered Immigration and Naturalization Service, splitting up its
law enforcement and service roles into separate bureaus within the
Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   The bill passed, 405 to 9, reflecting overwhelming support to
straighten out an agency that has become legendary for bureaucratic
incompetence, most recently when it notified a Florida flight school that
two of the Sept. 11 terrorists had been approved for U.S. visas--six
months after they attacked the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   "It is beyond time to restructure one of the worst-run agencies in the
federal government," said House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), the bill's sponsor. INS, he said, stood for
"Ignoring National Security" or "Incompetent and Negligent Service."</LD>
<TE>   The Senate could begin to consider its own version of an INS overhaul
as early as next week. While lawmakers still differ over details, the
broad goal of reshaping the nation's immigration service sparks little
controversy and may be one of the least disputed goals of Congress this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the vote, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft visited Capitol
Hill, telling lawmakers, "We are committed to ending the INS as we know
it." The White House has offered a qualified endorsement of the House
proposal but wants to establish a stronger office inside the Justice
Department to oversee the bureaus that would handle enforcement and
routine service.</TE>
<TE>   "I am convinced it is time for reform," House Minority Leader Richard
A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said Thursday, reflecting the broad, bipartisan
support for the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Declared Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.): "The common goal of ridding our
system of an incompetent agency that costs people their lives is a worthy
one. . . . Unfortunately, it took the terrorist acts of Sept. 11 and one
bizarre INS foul-up after another to get the ball rolling."</TE>
<TE>   Long before Sept. 11, INS actions--and inactions--had given rise to an
army of critics. The immigration agency was lambasted for mishandling
paperwork, losing track of deportees and meting out justice with
different standards in different parts of the country. Lawful immigrants
complained of endless backlogs, and many blamed the INS for the nation's
burgeoning population of illegal residents.</TE>
<TE>   But last year's terrorist attacks elevated the chronic complaints to a
priority. Three of the 19 hijackers remained in the country after falling
out of legal status, including one who had been granted a student visa
and never reported to school.</TE>
<TE>   Some objections to the House bill reflected the view not that the bill
went too far but that it did not go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "The same people at the INS will be doing the same things they're
doing today, which are the same things that they were doing prior to
Sept. 11," complained Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.). He argued that the House
bill, rather than bringing fundamental reform, "simply rearranges the
boxes on the existing organization chart of INS."</TE>
<TE>   Under the House bill, a new associate attorney general for immigration
affairs would supervise the new divisions as the third-ranking official
within the Justice Department. Despite the high rank, critics questioned
whether the two new units would be left without a strong, unifying
leader.</TE>
<TE>   The White House contends that the proposed associate attorney general
would be in a weaker position than the existing INS commissioner. Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has been preparing a bill that is expected to
come closer to White House demands, and the White House has hinted that
it will work closely with the Senate to advance the INS overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   "You need an office at the top that has the ability to set the tone
for national immigration policy," said Larry Gonzalez, Washington office
director for the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed
Officials. Otherwise, he maintained, conflicting policies and messages
could emerge from the separate enforcement operations, such as the Border
Patrol, and more routine immigration services.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the Bush administration unveiled its own plan to remake
the INS, with a similar separation of enforcement and immigrant service
functions.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge has been promoting a
plan to merge the Border Patrol, which is part of INS, and the Customs
Service, which is part of the Treasury Department, in a new agency
responsible for border security. That proposal is being debated inside
the administration and enjoys at least some support on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials sought a low profile Thursday, signaling their support
for the White House approach while trying not to make new enemies in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "The service has always said that its goals for restructuring are the
separation of enforcement and service, the establishment of clear lines
of authority and improved accountability and performance," INS officials
said in an unsigned statement. "INS will continue to work closely with
Congress to achieve these objectives."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft described the INS overhaul Thursday as a work in progress,
implying that the administration hoped the emerging Senate bill would
more closely reflect the White House approach.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the end of the journey," the attorney general said. "This
is an important first step essential to the journey's end but not
sufficient to get us there."</TE>

<HD>Spy Trial for Retired Officer Is Postponed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge agreed Thursday to delay until possibly January the
espionage trial of a retired Air Force master sergeant accused of
plotting to spy for Iraq, China and Libya.</LD>
<LD>   The move by U.S. District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee in Alexandria, Va.,
gives defense lawyers and prosecutors more time to prepare for the
unusual death-penalty case against Brian Patrick Regan, 39.</LD>
<LD>   The judge will set a new trial date May 3 but advised lawyers to
consider Jan. 13 or later.</LD>
<TE>   Regan worked for the Air Force and briefly for TRW Inc., a defense
contractor, at the National Reconnaissance Office. He is charged with
three counts of attempted espionage and one count of gathering national
security information.</TE>
<TE>   Regan has pleaded not guilty. The case is unusual because it is the
first time in decades the government has sought the death penalty in an
espionage case and because prosecutors do not allege that Regan's actions
resulted in anyone's death.</TE>
<TE>   Even the judge noted in his 21-page decision Thursday: "It is fair to
say that the government's intent to seek the death penalty in this case
was unexpected in light of other espionage cases heard in this district."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Regan intended to offer Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein secret details about American satellites that could help Iraq
hide its antiaircraft missiles in exchange for $13 million in Swiss
currency. He also is accused of plotting to sell similar information to
China and Libya.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, the judge set an unexpectedly early trial date of
June 3. Regan's lawyers formally complained the date was too soon for a
death-penalty case, and even prosecutors noted that it would take at
least 45 days to obtain security clearances to allow defense experts to
examine classified documents. The two sides had proposed a Nov. 12 trial.</TE>
<TE>   The June trial date gave the sides just 43 days before testimony was
to begin.</TE>
<TE>   "This court regrets that defense counsel have the impression that the
court is more concerned with the speed of the so-called 'rocket docket'
than with fairness in this case," the judge wrote. The federal court in
the Washington suburb is known among lawyers as the "rocket docket"
because of the speed with which its criminal trials move.</TE>
<TE>   In agreeing to set a new trial date, the judge said Thursday that
defense lawyers showed him "good cause" why the trial should be delayed
because they supplied sworn statements by legal experts "describing what
work remains to be done on the case."</TE>
<TE>   The judge also said that he "has attended to the defendant's rights
since the beginning of this case," countering what he said were claims by
defense lawyers that "the court has exhibited indifference to the
accused's 6th Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel."</TE>
<TE>   The judge wrote that, by appointing some of the most prominent lawyers
available to work on Regan's behalf, he "provided the defendant with the
means necessary for a more-than-adequate legal representation." The judge
also noted that defense lawyers have had more than eight months since

<HD>Panel's Vote for Nuclear Waste Site Points to House OK</HD>
<DH>Legislation: The 41-6 tally gives a bipartisan endorsement to the
administration's Yucca Mountain plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A plan to bury the nation's nuclear waste in southern Nevada won
lopsided endorsement Thursday from a congressional committee, signaling
easy passage by the full House to override the state's objections.</LD>
<LD>   While approval from the House Energy and Commerce Committee had been
expected, the breadth of the margin gave a bipartisan stamp to the Bush
administration's effort to make Yucca Mountain a permanent site for tens
of thousands of tons of radioactive waste now stored in many states.</LD>
<TE>17 Democrats Join Forces With GOP</TE>
<TE>   In the panel's 41-6 vote, 17 Democrats joined 24 Republicans to back a
bill to allow the federal government to move ahead with opening Yucca
Mountain to receive waste as early as 2010.</TE>
<TE>   The vote came amid continuing scientific debate about the Yucca
Mountain plan. The site is about 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas and 215
miles northeast of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In an article to be published today in Science magazine, two
researchers who describe themselves as "pro-nuclear" contend that the
government should postpone decisions on Yucca Mountain until more is
known about its geology and the durability of storage devices.</TE>
<TE>   "A project of this importance . . . should not go forward until the
relevant scientific issues have been thoughtfully addressed," wrote
Rodney Ewing, a geologist at the University of Michigan, and Allison
Macfarlane, director of the Yucca Mountain Project at MIT.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing and Macfarlane wrote that politics rather than science is
driving the Yucca Mountain decisions, a view that Bush administration
officials vigorously dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. W. J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee, said Thursday's vote was "an enormous show of support" for an
administration plan backed by the nuclear energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether you like nuclear energy or not," Tauzin said, "this country
can't do without it."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush signed off on the Yucca Mountain plan in February, but
Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican, reversed that decision earlier
this month. Under federal law, a simple majority vote in both houses of
Congress is required to overrule Guinn.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin said a vote on the House floor would come within two weeks.</TE>
<TE>Gephardt Says Store It Where It's Produced</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) is among those
intending to fight the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it makes sense to have all this nuclear waste travel
across the country by truck or rail," Gephardt told reporters. He said he
favors a European approach: "Do your best to store this stuff safely at
the site where it has been produced."</TE>
<TE>   The six opponents in Thursday's vote were all Democrats, three from
California: Reps. Jane Harman of Venice, Lois Capps of Santa Barbara and
Anna G. Eshoo of San Mateo.</TE>
<TE>   Still, House opponents appear outmatched. In its last vote on Yucca
Mountain in early 2000, the House approved a waste-storage plan, 253 to
167. Most of the opponents at that time were Democrats. But some foes of
the earlier plan have now switched, including Rep. John D. Dingell of
Michigan, top Democrat on the commerce panel.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a surprise in the House, the focus of the battle would then
move to the Senate, where foes hope to make a last stand against the
Yucca Mountain plan. A Senate vote is projected for June or July.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, the Senate would seem a formidable obstacle for the
plan's advocates. Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the assistant majority
leader, and Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) are vehemently opposed to it. So is
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   But in this case, federal law bars most parliamentary maneuvers
against the legislation. Opponents have said their only hope to kill the
plan is to amass a 51-vote majority; so far they appear to be well short.</TE>
<TE>   In a Senate vote in May 2000 on the issue, 35 senators opposed nuclear
waste storage at Yucca Mountain. That vote upheld President Clinton's
veto of a Republican-crafted bill.</TE>
<TE>   Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham expressed confidence that in the
current dispute, the Bush administration would prevail.</TE>
<TE>   "The actions here in the House demonstrate the broad bipartisan
support we have to move ahead in this process," Abraham told reporters.
"At the end of the day, the Senate will follow the House's lead."</TE>

<HD>Judge Leans Toward Declaring Death Penalty Unconstitutional</HD>
<DH>Law: The tentative order, if upheld, would affect only federal
cases in three states. But reaction was swift and strong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in New York said Thursday that he was on the verge
of declaring the federal death penalty law unconstitutional because too
many condemned inmates have turned out to be innocent.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff issued the tentative order in a
pending narcotics and murder case in which two men face a possible death
sentence. If he makes the order final, the two defendants would still
face murder charges but could not be executed if convicted.</LD>
<LD>   At present, Rakoff's order is not binding on any other judge. If the
ruling is upheld by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, it will affect
federal death penalty cases in New York, Connecticut and Vermont. It
would have no effect on cases in state courts in the 38 states that have
capital punishment.</LD>
<TE>   However tentative, the order stunned death penalty lawyers and legal
scholars around the country. Some hailed Rakoff's order as a bold move,
while others decried it as absurd and predicted that it would be
overturned by a federal appeals court. The order comes at a time of
increased debate over the fairness of how capital punishment is
administered in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Our system of criminal justice, for all its protections, is
sufficiently fallible that innocent people are convicted of capital
crimes with some frequency," wrote Rakoff, a former federal prosecutor
who was appointed to the bench by President Clinton in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Innocent people are being sent to death row "with a frequency far
greater than previously supposed," Rakoff said, citing the fact that 12
men sentenced to death have been exonerated by DNA testing since 1984.</TE>
<TE>   DNA testing and other innovative measures "may enable us not only to
prevent future mistakes but also to rectify past ones by releasing
wrongfully convicted persons--but only if such persons are still alive to
be released," Rakoff wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The judge emphasized that the issue went beyond those exonerated
through DNA tests. He said there had been at least 20 cases over the last
decade in which defendants sentenced to death had been released from
prison "on grounds indicating factual innocence derived from evidence
other than DNA."</TE>
<TE>   The judge said an implicit assumption made by the U.S. Supreme Court
in a 1993 ruling--that U.S. judicial safeguards made it "highly unlikely"
an innocent person could be executed--is "no longer . . . tenable."</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Rakoff said that it is possible that an individual could
be executed before he had a full opportunity to demonstrate his innocence
and therefore would be deprived of due process of law.</TE>
<TE>   "If the court were compelled to decide the issue today, it would . . .
grant the defendants' motion to dismiss all death penalty aspects of this
case on the ground that the federal statute is unconstitutional," Rakoff
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that "prudence dictates" he allow the government one
last opportunity to be heard, Rakoff gave Justice Department lawyers
until May 15 to submit additional briefs and indicated that he would
issue a final ruling in June.</TE>
<TE>   Rakoff acted in response to briefs filed by attorneys Kevin McNally of
Frankfort, Ky., and Jean D. Barrett of Montclair, N.J., who respectively
represent Alan Quinones and Diego Rodriguez, the two men the government
is seeking to execute.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department decided to seek death sentences against
Quinones and Rodriguez, whose trial is scheduled to start in September,
over the advice of former U.S. Atty. Mary Jo White, according to court
documents.</TE>
<TE>   McNally hailed the ruling. "Actually, it is a pretty simple argument,"
he said. "How can a system tolerate the danger of executing innocent
citizens? It was triggered by this repeated avalanche of documented cases
of innocent people who had been sentenced to death."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the U.S. attorney's office in New York nor the Justice
Department had any immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   In briefs filed earlier, the government conceded that "research has
not uncovered a case addressing the precise point" raised by the defense
lawyers--"whether the death penalty violates due process, and is
therefore unconstitutional, because by its very nature, it cuts off a
defendant's ability to establish his actual innocence."</TE>
<TE>   However, the government contended that the defense argument flew in
the face of the Supreme Court ruling in the 1993 case known as Herrera
vs. Collins. In that decision, the high court ruled that a state death
row inmate who presents belated evidence of innocence is generally not
entitled to a new hearing in federal court before being executed.</TE>
<TE>   But Rakoff said the Herrera decision does not provide "the guidance
necessary" to resolve the issue in this instance because at this stage
the defendants are presumed to be innocent. In contrast, Rakoff wrote,
Herrera already had been convicted and had a tenuous claim of innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Elisabeth Semel, who runs the death penalty clinic at UC Berkeley's
Boalt Hall Law School, applauded the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "In recent years there has been a lot of discussion about the
procedural aspects of how the death penalty is administered. But Judge
Rakoff is talking about substantive due process--whether or not the
nature of the death penalty is such that in the modern era it by
definition deprives innocent people of the right to life," Semel said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rory K. Little, a professor at Hastings College of Law in San
Francisco, called the ruling "absurd" and predicted that it would be
overturned. "To say that the federal death penalty violates due process
of law is inconsistent with prior Supreme Court precedents," said Little,
who served on the Justice Department's capital punishment review
committee from 1996 to 1997. "I think he ruled with his heart, not with
his head."</TE>
<TE>   Added Kent Scheidegger of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in
Sacramento: "The fact that a handful of people have been cleared out of
many thousands sentenced to death does not change the constitutional
status of capital punishment."</TE>
<TE>   Two people have been executed under the current federal death penalty
law, enacted in 1994: Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J. McVeigh and Juan R.
Garza, for a drug-related murder in Texas. There are 20 people on federal
death row in Terre Haute, Ind.</TE>

<HD>It's Crunch Time for ABC's Jennings</HD>
<DH>Negotiations: The TV anchorman may be asked to take a pay cut, as
the news division tries to trim spiraling costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Speculation intensified in the television news business over
whether ABC News flagship anchor Peter Jennings is being asked to take a
pay cut along with others in the newsroom, prompting both the anchor and
ABC News management to issue statements.</LD>
<LD>   Jennings' contract expires this summer, and top management at ABC News
has said the network wants to keep the newsman, who is estimated to make
between $7 million and $10 million annually for anchoring "World News
Tonight"--on a par with NBC's Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather at CBS.</LD>
<LD>   Still, ABC's news division, with an annual budget of about $500
million, has been under strict cost restrictions in the last year,
eliminating 125 positions, letting some high-profile correspondents such
as Sheila MacVicar and Morton Dean leave, and asking many senior
employees to take pay cuts of as much as 25%.</LD>
<TE>   The financial crunch has been compounded by higher news-gathering
costs for covering the war in Afghanistan and the turmoil in the Middle
East. Moreover, across the industry, executives have been increasingly
focused on the fate of their morning news broadcasts--which have been
growing in viewers and profits--while evening newscasts have been on a
long downward trend that has stabilized only this year.</TE>
<TE>   Several people in the small circle of news talent agents and lawyers
have been saying for weeks that Jennings, 63, would be asked to take a
cut. The speculation went public this week with Internet and published
reports concerning the matter, which quoted anonymous sources.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many in the industry have been skeptical that ABC management
would ask Jennings to reduce his salary, given the signal that would send
coming on the heels of the revelation that ABC was willing to get rid of
"Nightline" if it could steal comedian David Letterman away from CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Letterman decided to stay at CBS, and ABC management and "Nightline"
recently made peace, with the issuance of mutually supportive statements,
but not before bitter words had been exchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Those involved in the negotiations limited themselves to short
statements that steered clear of the pay cut issue. In his, Jennings
said, "In more than 30 years, I've never commented on any contract
negotiations, nor have I negotiated publicly. I see no reason at this
time to change."</TE>
<TE>   ABC News President David Westin, meanwhile, said, "We have every hope
and expectation that Peter will be our principal anchor for many years to
come. We will not discuss Peter's or anyone else's contract in the press
in any way."</TE>
<TE>   Just in case, though, ABC executives have talked internally about
"Good Morning America" co-anchor Charlie Gibson as a possible replacement
for Jennings, people familiar with the situation said. Gibson's contract
also is due to expire soon.</TE>

<HD>Pa. Delays Auction of Gas Drilling Rights</HD>
<DH>Environment: A council calls for postponement until the public can
weigh in. Effect on state forest land is cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARRISBURG, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>State officials delayed the largest-ever auction of natural gas
drilling rights on public forest land Thursday after being criticized for
trying to keep the event from public scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   If auctioned, the leases could result in more high-pressure natural
gas drilling on state forest land, adding to the handful of high-pressure
wells and hundreds of shallow wells already there.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, a state environmental advisory council voted to
recommend postponing the auction pending further public comment after
hearing details for the first time from John C. Oliver, state secretary
for Conservation and Natural Resources.</LD>
<TE>   The council members, like environmental activists and members of the
public, did not learn about the auction until Oliver's department
advertised for bids in newspapers a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we followed our standard procedure with this lease, we
should have made our plans known well in advance," Oliver said Thursday.
"It became clear the public did not view this lease as 'standard.' "</TE>
<TE>   A public comment period will end June 15, Oliver said, and a decision
to reschedule the auction will be made by July 31.</TE>
<TE>   The auction had been scheduled to involve 141 tracts of state land
making up about 500,000 acres, an area representing nearly one-fourth of
the land run by the state's forestry bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The object of the gas industry's interest is a long streak of natural
gas captured in the fractures and faults of 400-million-year-old rock
along the Appalachian Mountains and beyond. Officials say it could
produce the state's most lucrative drilling harvest ever.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its depth--two to three miles, five times deeper than the
reach of traditional, shallow wells--the deposits have gone largely
unexplored.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists warn that the drilling and accompanying pipelines
and roads will shatter an unbroken swath of forest, upsetting sensitive
wildlife habitats and ruining recreation areas.</TE>
<TE>   They noted that Thursday's postponement did not appear to include
plans for an environmental impact statement detailing the potential risks
to public health and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in north-central Pennsylvania spiked in the last few years
after companies drilled successful wells across the state line in New
York, where the formation is closer to the surface and less expensive to
reach.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Donald Siegelman signed a law Thursday making lethal injection
the primary method of execution in Alabama, leaving Nebraska as the only
state exclusively using the electric chair.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning July 1, condemned inmates in Alabama will die by injection
unless they choose the electric chair.</LD>
<LD>   Siegelman said the change was a precaution in case the Supreme Court
rules the electric chair is cruel and unusual punishment. Prosecutors
backed the change.</LD>
<TE>   The Supreme Court this month blocked the execution of Alabama death
row inmate Gary Leon Brown, convicted of stabbing a man to death in 1987.
His appeal contended, in part, that the electric chair is cruel and
unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama's electric chair was last used in June 2000.</TE>

<HD>A Revamped Cole Returns to Its Home Port</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORFOLK, Va.
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. destroyer Cole returned to its home port Thursday a
stronger, better ship than when a terrorist bomb ripped it open and
killed 17 of its sailors a year and a half ago in Yemen.</LD>
<LD>   The Cole underwent $250 million in repairs over 14 months at Northrop
Grumman's Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., then began the trip to
Norfolk Naval Station last week.</LD>
<LD>   A steady rain fell as several hundred people waited under tents in a
parking lot at the base. As the ship came into view, people began waving
American flags and snapping photos.</LD>
<TE>   Ronald W. Francis drove five hours from his home in North Carolina to
honor the memory of his daughter, Lakeina Monique Francis, 19, a mess
management specialist who died in the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter is part of the ship. I want to visualize what she was
doing on the ship," Francis said.</TE>
<TE>   John Clodfelter, of Mechanicsville, Va., father of slain hull
technician Kenneth Clodfelter, 21, went to Mississippi to see the ship
depart and drove to Norfolk to see it dock.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that the Cole comes back. I want very much to let
those people that did this know that they haven't gotten away with it,"
said Clodfelter, fighting tears.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials blame Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network for the Sept.
11 attacks and the Cole blast, carried out by terrorists who pulled an
explosives-laden skiff alongside the destroyer as it refueled on Oct. 12,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy invited more than 600 service members, former Cole sailors
and relatives of the slain sailors to welcome the ship.</TE>

<HD>Newspaper Gets a Good-Natured Dressing-Down Over Misquote</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WICHITA, Kan.
</DL>
<LD>Barbara Bush decided it was breast not to take offense.</LD>
<LD>   The former first lady was in El Dorado this month to speak at Butler
County Community College. A reporter for the Wichita Eagle misheard her,
and the newspaper quoted her as joking about having three "breast sizes"
during her life, rather than three "dress sizes."</LD>
<LD>   The newspaper ran a correction the next day, but it recently received
a letter from Mrs. Bush. The paper ran the letter on its Sunday editorial
page.</LD>
<TE>   "I've just become abreast of your recent article, 'Barbara Bush wows
El Dorado,' " the letter began.</TE>
<TE>   "I am indeed a bosom buddy to two presidents, so I shared some of the
things I have learned in 76 years of life," she wrote. "That includes 57
years of married life, six children, 14 grandchildren, five wars, three
DRESS sizes, two governors, two parachute jumps, and now two presidents.</TE>
<TE>   "Your article has left this generally outspoken mother speechless, but
has given my children much to laugh about."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the typewritten letter was a hand-penned note: "I just
wanted to get this off my chest!"</TE>

<HD>Draft Rule to Let Mines Dump in Streams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has drafted a rule that would permit coal
and hard-rock mining companies to continue piling leftover rock and dirt
into the streams of nearby valleys.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists charged Thursday that the rule would allow companies
to fill waterways with mining wastes and toxins.</LD>
<LD>   "It is the most sweeping major rollback of Clean Water Act rules in
the last 30 years," Natural Resources Defense Council attorney Daniel
Rosenberg said.</LD>
<TE>   Environmental Protection Agency officials countered that the proposed
rule would merely permit industry to continue to do what it has been
doing for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't change the way we currently regulate," said Greg Peck,
deputy wetlands director for EPA.</TE>
<TE>   The rule, which the administration has said it will publish in final
form this month, would authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to give
permits for the discharge of waste into streams.</TE>
<TE>Approval From Congress Not Needed</TE>
<TE>   Coal and hard-rock mining companies have been pressuring the
administration for the rule change because they want to ensure that they
can continue piling leftover rock and dirt into nearby valleys, even if
they hold streams.</TE>
<TE>   The rule, which the administration can put into effect without
congressional approval, would particularly affect the Appalachian coal
fields of West Virginia and Kentucky, where it would permit a practice
that is permanently transforming the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Mining companies are using giant machines to remove the top several
hundred feet of mountain ridges to expose the low-sulfur coal that lies
in layers between rock and dirt. They have dumped excess rock and dirt
from the operations into hundreds of valleys, filling more than 1,000
miles of streams across the region.</TE>
<TE>   "In West Virginia, it will allow the destruction of hundreds of miles
of stream and hundreds of square miles of forests," said Joe Lovett, a
West Virginia lawyer who has represented Appalachian residents in suits
against mountaintop mining operations. "This is the Bush administration
carrying water for the coal industry."</TE>
<TE>   EPA Administrator Christie Whitman this week defended the change.
"It's not a giveaway to the mining industry. It doesn't allow activity
that isn't already underway."</TE>
<TE>   If finalized, the rule likely would undermine a pending lawsuit that
challenges the corps' right to permit coal companies to fill streams with
mining waste, the Bush administration and environmentalists agreed.</TE>
<TE>   A draft of the final rule, dated Feb. 28, was provided Thursday to The
Times by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials said the draft reflects the administration's plans,
although changes may be made before it is finalized. EPA spokesman Joe
Martyak said the agency will "soon" implement the new rule.</TE>
<TE>   A Clinton administration proposal, never put into action, had
considered designating some material, such as toxic substances, as
unsuitable fill. The Bush proposal has no such requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Also unlike the Clinton proposal, the Bush draft would not require
that companies abide by so-called effluent standards, which restrict the
amount of toxins that industries can release into waterways and wetlands
from solid fill.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Flynn, an attorney for the Boulder, Colo.-based Western Mining
Action Project, said the new rule could mean that more high-sulfur rock
dug up with gold and other minerals would end up polluting streams in the
West.</TE>
<TE>Some Trash Still Off Limits as Fill</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists complained that the EPA responded to the industry's
requests for changes to the rule but ignored thousands of requests from
environmental groups and their supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Peck said the new rule specifically would forbid tossing ordinary
trash--such as junk cars, old tires and discarded kitchen appliances.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the rule did not mean that the EPA condoned all the
effects of mountaintop removal mining.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA and other federal agencies are studying the effects of
mountaintop removal mining and plan to present an environmental impact
statement this summer that will include suggestions for any needed
regulatory changes, Peck said.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Cut Pollution at National Parks Gains</HD>
<DH>Environment: The EPA says it intends to back a proposal to reduce
emissions from power plants in the West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to clear away a veil of haze from the West's premier
national parks, the Bush administration announced Thursday that it
intends to approve plans to slash emissions from power plants and other
sources.</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting in Salt Lake City sponsored by the Western Governors
Assn., Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman
endorsed a pollution-control plan formulated by a partnership of nine
states, Indian tribes and environmental groups over the last decade. The
plan aims to cut pollutants that obscure visibility at many national
parks and wilderness areas.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe the plan that the partnership has presented is an
innovative approach to improving air quality, and EPA shares goals of
protecting some of America's most treasured national parks and wilderness
areas," Whitman said.</LD>
<TE>   Among the celebrated landscapes expected to benefit from the plan are
Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona and Bryce Canyon and Canyonlands
national parks in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Smoke from power plants, smelters and factories dotting the West is a
major source of haze that dramatically impairs visibility and rains acids
on fragile ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   The decision comes as the White House and Congress consider measures
to change the way power plants are regulated nationwide. While most of
that debate is focused on power plants in the Midwest, the plan Whitman
endorsed ensures significant pollution cuts will be made at coal-fired
generators across the West over the next 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   However, the need for stringent controls at the power plants has been
tempered by the need to ensure the plan is palatable to Western
businesses and politicians.</TE>
<TE>   The plan Whitman endorsed calls on power producers to voluntarily
reduce smokestack emissions. States, too, can opt out of the program
completely if they choose, although the EPA expects compliance to be high
because alternative control programs would likely be more onerous. The
plan affects power producers operating in California, Utah, Colorado,
Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   If power producers fail to meet voluntary pollution reduction targets,
the plan calls for launching an emission trading program under which
polluters can buy and sell pollution credits. Companies that fail to meet
their targets can buy credits from the ones that cut emissions beyond
what is required.</TE>
<TE>   The plan defers the most aggressive reductions for more than a decade,
allowing the power plants and smelters to continue to produce emissions
near today's levels through 2013. And it addresses only sulfur oxides.
Other haze-forming emissions, such as nitrogen oxides, are not scheduled
for controls at these power plants until 2008.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the most aggressive piece of regulation you've ever seen,
but there is much to be said for reaching this agreement through a
consensus process," said an EPA official.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, in a rare show of support for Bush administration environmental
policies, environmentalists endorsed the program and praised Whitman for
supporting it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real step in the right direction. It's a big step, it's
significant and it's praiseworthy," said Fred Krupp, executive director
of Environmental Defense, an advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for cutting sulfur oxide emissions by 26% over the next
16 years. Today, dozens of power plants across the West release 650,000
tons of the pollutant annually. Big smokestacks emit it high into the
air, where it spreads far, reducing visibility by half in some national
parks. Some of the oldest power plants have no emission controls.
Emissions from those generators would be reduced by about 85% by the end
of the program, the EPA said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists are particularly pleased with a provision that
allows no more than 480,000 tons of sulfur oxides by 2018, regardless of
how many power plants are operating in the West. Clean-air advocates said
that amounts to a pollution cap that ensures reductions will continue
even as power plants are built.</TE>
<TE>   To meet rising energy needs in California and other Western states,
power companies have proposed adding up to 50,000 megawatts of new
electrical generation across the West. Environmentalists said the plan
guarantees those new generators and boilers will not generate dirtier air
in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a safety net for the West. It causes emissions to continue to
go down. There's no other driver in the West to get this done," said
Vicki Patton, an attorney for Environmental Defense.</TE>
<TE>   By signaling her intent to approve the plan, Whitman's decision ends
an effort begun in 1990 to devise a solution to regional haze that
affected 156 national parks and wilderness areas across the Colorado
Plateau.</TE>
<TE>   The public has 60 days to submit comments to the EPA on the plan, and
a public meeting is scheduled for early June in Phoenix.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Defense to Talk With Federal Workers</HD>
<DH>Trial: Team seeks to bolster its contention that the American Talib
never meant to harm his countrymen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Two dozen federal employees who had contact with John Walker Lindh
in Afghanistan or on a Navy ship have agreed to talk to the lawyers
defending him on charges of conspiring to kill Americans abroad and
helping terrorists, according to court documents filed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The defense had asked to talk to 77 people they thought might support
their contention that Lindh never meant to hurt his countrymen and was
mistreated before he gave statements to the FBI that form the bulk of the
case against him. Fifty-one military and FBI employees declined to be
interviewed.</LD>
<LD>   Lindh's lawyers also can seek to subpoena government employees who
choose not to cooperate. They've already filed such a request in the case
of a CIA employee, identified in court documents as CS-1, who was present
during a prison riot in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, when CIA officer
Johnny "Mike" Spann was killed and Lindh was wounded after being captured
with Taliban fighters.</LD>
<TE>   The eight-page report, filed by prosecutors in U.S. District Court in
suburban Alexandria, Va., came as both sides told U.S. District Judge
T.S. Ellis III they were having trouble meeting the schedule he has set.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors already missed Tuesday's deadline for giving the defense
all the evidence to which it is entitled and asked for a three-week
extension. The defense wrote that the delay will put them behind schedule
too, and asked Ellis to shift the Aug. 26 trial date to Sept. 16.</TE>
<TE>   The defense interview requests, along with their efforts to gain
access to about 20 of the Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees being held at
the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, suggest that the legal team led by
James Brosnahan is considering calling a large number of witnesses to
describe what happened to Lindh during his stint with the Taliban and
after his capture.</TE>

<HD>Senate Democrat to Keynote NRA Meeting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO
</DL>
<LD>This weekend, Georgia Sen. Zell Miller will become the first
Democrat in more than a decade to give the keynote address to the
National Rifle Assn.'s annual meeting here.</LD>
<LD>   The first-term senator has criticized fellow Democrats for failing to
understand issues important to rural voters in the South and elsewhere,
including gun rights. He contends that failure cost Al Gore the 2000
presidential campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "Our party can't let this happen again," Miller wrote in a column in
the New York Times in June. "And given the demographic changes that
determine the makeup of the House of Representatives and the Electoral
College, it will happen again if the Democratic Party fails to recover
its strength in the South."</LD>
<TE>   NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said Miller has also been a "good
supporter" of the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have Democrats who support the NRA," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Rep. Martin Frost was the last Democrat to give a keynote
address at the NRA's national convention, in 1991. The year before it was
delivered by then-Rep. Mike Espy (R-Miss.), who later became President
Clinton's agriculture secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada Rep. Jim Gibbons, a longtime NRA backer, is among Republicans
welcoming the change of pace at the 131st annual meeting running today
through Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I applaud the NRA for broadening the inclusion of those Democrats who
also support the 2nd Amendment," Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   NRA leaders say Democrats have been warming to their group since
Gore's narrow loss to George W. Bush. They say a number of Democratic
congressional candidates, especially in the South and West, are
emphasizing support for gun rights.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats in the South will remember Gore as only the third Democrat
since the Civil War to lose not only every state in the old Confederacy,
but two border states as well, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The two others, George McGovern and Walter Mondale, "had an excuse
because they were crushed in national landslides," Miller said.</TE>

<DH>Adrift: The expense of retrieving the canine from a tanker in the
Pacific has sparked a debate about money.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU
</DL>
<LD>An almost comically ineffectual effort to rescue a dog stranded
aboard a tanker adrift in the Pacific has people in Hawaii and beyond
asking: What is a dog's life really worth?</LD>
<LD>   The extraordinary operation to save 2-year-old Forgea already has cost
$48,000 in private funds, and the Coast Guard is prepared to spend
taxpayer dollars on what has become one of the most expensive animal
rescues ever.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's ridiculous," said Cyndi Damo, a dog owner from
Huntington Beach visiting Honolulu. "There's many ways the money could've
been better spent--there's still children that go to bed hungry."</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's cool," Honolulu resident Darryl Uekawa said. "It's the
right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Forgea, a 40-pound white terrier mix, has been alone on the crippled
tanker Insiko 1907 since April 2, when the cruise ship Norwegian Star
rescued the captain and 10 crew members. An engine room fire aboard the
Indonesian tanker March 13 killed one crew member and knocked out power
and communications aboard the ship, which serviced fishing boats with
fuel and supplies.</TE>
<TE>   As of Thursday the tanker was more than 600 miles southwest of
Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear why Forgea was left behind during the rescue, but the
Taiwanese captain--the dog's owner--said there may have been a language
barrier between him and the rescuers from the cruise ship.</TE>
<TE>   A Norwegian Star passenger's remark about the dog on the local TV news
prompted viewer calls to the Hawaiian Humane Society, which began a
rescue effort April 5 that was called off two days later when the Insiko
could not be found.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, a Japanese fishing boat spotted the tanker, but Forgea's
condition wasn't known until a Coast Guard plane saw the dog running back
and forth across the bridge on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But when a fishing vessel arrived the next day to help, Forgea, who
has lived on the tanker since she was 8 weeks old, ran from rescuers and
hid below deck.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen spent two days in vain trying to tempt the dog with peanut
butter and calling out "come" in Mandarin, the language she was raised
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday, the Insiko drifted within U.S. territorial waters around
Johnston Island and into the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard, which has
authority to treat the 256-foot Insiko and its 60,000 gallons of diesel
fuel and lubricating oil as a hazard to the marine life around the atoll.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard has allotted up to $250,000 to avert an environmental
disaster--an operation that also will include the rescue of Forgea and an
attempt to recover the remains of the dead crew member, said Coast Guard
Capt. Gilbert Kanazawa, who is in charge of the operation.</TE>
<TE>   A salvage tug hired by the Coast Guard was sent from Honolulu on
Tuesday with Humane Society-approved dog traps and is expected to reach
the tanker today. Coast Guard officials said a decision has not been made
about what to do with the tanker.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawaiian Humane Society said its rescue effort will be covered by
$30,000 from the Humane Society of the United States and donations from
animal lovers around the country. But the tab could run higher if the
tug's crew is unable to capture the dog and the Humane Society has to fly
someone to the ship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not tax dollars. It's not coming from people that don't like
animals," said Martha Armstrong of the national Humane Society in
Washington. "That's what we do, that's what our mission is. Whether it's
one dog or a million."</TE>
<TE>   The captain told a Taiwan newspaper this week he wants his dog back.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could fly to Hawaii right away and tell Forgea that 'you
were the bravest on the ship,' " Chung Chen-po told United Daily News. He
said he adopted the dog at an Indonesian port and named her for the
Mandarin word meaning "fortune."</TE>

<LD>Sobell obituary--An obituary of Helen Levitov Sobell in Wednesday's
California section stated that the guilt of convicted spies Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg is still a matter of wide debate. It should have noted
that the U.S. government released intercepted Soviet messages in 1995
that identified the Rosenbergs as atomic spies. The documents appear to
end any doubts about the guilt of the Rosenbergs, who were executed in
1953 for conspiracy to commit espionage.</LD>

<LD>Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, a controversial member of chart-topping
American R&amp;B trio TLC, was killed in a car crash in Honduras Thursday, a
spokeswoman for her record label said.</LD>
<LD>   No other details were supplied by Laura Swanson, a representative of
Arista Records in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The lineup of TLC, whose hit songs included "No Scrubs" and
"Waterfalls," was rounded out by Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas and Tionne
"T-Boz" Watkins.</LD>
<TE>   Lopes, who was in her 30s, made headlines in 1994 after she was
arrested for burning down the house of her then-boyfriend, former Atlanta
Falcons wide receiver Andre Rison.</TE>
<TE>   TLC's most recent album, 1999's "FanMail," topped the U.S. pop album
charts for five weeks and won the Grammy for best R&amp;B album the following
year.</TE>
<TE>   The R&amp;B community was rocked last August by the death of singer
Aaliyah Haughton, 22, who was killed in a plane crash after shooting a
music video in the Bahamas for her single "Rock the Boat."</TE>
<TE>   A full obituary will appear in Saturday's edition.</TE>

<LD>SOMEBODY'S GOTTA TELL IT</LD>
<LD>   The Upbeat Memoir</LD>
<LD>   of a Working-Class Journalist</LD>
<TE>   by Jack Newfield</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's</TE>
<TE>   352 pp., $25.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to become exasperated by "Somebody's Gotta Tell It,"
Jack Newfield's fond account of his life and times, chiefly as a
columnist for the Village Voice, the New York Daily News and the New
York Post. Newfield is so full of himself that he inadvertently
provides the only memorable humor in his rambling memoir:</TE>
<TE>   "We all need mentors and role models," he writes. "Stephen
Sondheim had Oscar Hammerstein. Jimmy Cannon had Damon Runyon. Martin
Luther King had Dr. Benjamin Mays and Gandhi. Harry Belafonte had
Paul Robeson. Vin Scully had Red Barber to show him how to broadcast
a baseball game. Richard Brooke had John Huston to show him how to be
a writer-director. Aretha Franklin had Sam Cooke to show her how to
cross over from sacred gospel music to secular soul music. Spike Lee
had Martin Scorsese as a role model for how to become an independent
filmmaker with a personal vision.</TE>
<TE>   "And I had Mike Herrington."</TE>
<TE>   Well, Herrington, the democratic socialist, was a fine fellow, but
only Newfield would compare himself to Sondheim, King, Belafonte,
Scully, Brooke, Franklin and Lee, all in the same paragraph.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Newfield doesn't think Herrington was all that fine. In
a perceptive comment in a book that has quite a few of them, despite
the author's deep self-absorption, Newfield argues that Herrington,
who could have been a fine "native American radical," was drawn into
a European kind of left-wing sectarianism.</TE>
<TE>   Observations like that aside, mostly Newfield stays safely inside
his own world, populated by his heroes, who are standing off the
enemy. His heroes are, in particular, King and Robert F. Kennedy.
They also include--Newfield is a great maker of lists--Jackie
Robinson, Murray Kempton, I.F. Stone, Paul Goodman, Norman Mailer,
Richard Wright, Pete Hamill, Phil Ochs, Mario Cuomo, Sugar Ray
Robinson, the old Brooklyn Dodgers. His enemies are the New York
Yankees, Walter O'Malley, Richard Nixon and, after about 1967, the
New Left. That last is important because Newfield makes a great point
of not leaving patriotism to the right wing. He writes that, when he
was in high school in the late 1950s and reading the Village Voice,
the paper's "politics straddled liberalism and radicalism in a
confused way, just as mine would for many years." The Voice
"simultaneously," Newfield continues, "promoted reform, socialism,
anarchism, bohemianism, pacifism, populism and participatory
democracy."</TE>
<TE>   After some years of life on the barricades, symbolic and real--he
was arrested at a Baltimore sit-in in 1963, went to the 1963 march on
Washington, the demonstration at Selma, Ala., in 1967 and the 1968
Democratic National Convention--Newfield was disgusted with the turns
the New Left was taking. In particular, he says, he was appalled by
such events as the expulsion of whites from the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee and the Students for a Democratic Society
"turning into vandals and bomb makers."</TE>
<TE>   Equally troubling to him was Tom Hayden "glorifying the
gangsterism of Huey Newton and the Black Panthers," Stokeley
Carmichael "spouting the poison of 'Zionism equals racism,'" and
Jerry Rubin "calling Sirhan Sirhan a 'freedom fighter.'" Newfield
became firmly centered as a liberal, not a radical. Incidentally, he
has warm words for Hayden overall and thinks he should have been a
writer, not a politician.</TE>
<TE>   The chapter "A Guilty Pleasure" is devoted to his fascination with
boxing, and the end of the book will interest students of New York
City politics and tabloid newspaper wars as he thinks about his time
at the Daily News and then the Post. He adds the Chicago Tribune Co.,
now the owner of the Los Angeles Times, to his list of enemies for
its role in trying to break the unions at the New York Daily News,
and he details the clamorous struggle at the Post between editors and
owners before it was rescued by the right-wing mogul Rupert Murdoch.
"Somebody's Gotta Tell It" is, in its boastful way, a mildly
entertaining account of one writer's earnest idealism.</TE>
