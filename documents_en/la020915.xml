<HD>Safety Rules Scarce in China's Factories</HD>
<DH>Asia: New protections will soon take effect for workers,
thousands of whom are killed or maimed annually. The injured often
cannot support themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN FACKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONGHUA, China</DL>
<LD>Twelve hours a day, seven days a week, He Qun worked at a factory in
China's southeast running a machine the size of a small bus that
punched holes in heavy steel sheets.</LD>
<LD>   One day, her arm slipped as she moved one of the sheets. Through
the numbing pain, she saw a severed hand fall to the factory floor.</LD>
<LD>   "All I remember thinking was, 'How did a hand get down there?' "
said He, 30. She had neither safety training nor equipment, she said,
and was too poor, and her hand too mangled, to get it reattached.</LD>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of Chinese are killed or maimed every year in
similar on-the-job accidents -- casualties of their country's rise as
a manufacturing powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese factories, many financed by foreign investors, supply the
world with goods from soccer balls to computer chips. But behind the
success is a rampant disregard for safety that experts and government
officials say makes it one of the most dangerous countries in the
world for workers.</TE>
<TE>   The mounting toll of deaths and injuries has grown so severe that
Beijing plans to impose China's first national safety laws Nov. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The new laws replace a patchwork of local regulations. They will
require more safety training and equipment, and give authorities the
power to arrest owners of dangerous factories.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the carnage, experts and officials point to a range of
reasons -- workers exhausted by long hours on outdated machinery,
lack of even basic precautions, a ban on independent labor unions
that could fight for workplace safety, and reluctance by local
officials to crack down for fear of losing jobs or payoffs from
factory owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Local authorities, factory owners, even workers themselves -- no
one really cares about safety. They all think the risks are a small
price to pay for economic advancement," said Xu Deshu, an advisor for
the State Administration of Safety Production, the government
worker-safety agency.</TE>
<TE>   In a report this month, the administration said 6,314 people were
killed in industrial accidents in the first six months of this year.
That's above the pace of 2001, when 11,047 workers died over the
whole year. More than half of this year's deaths were at coal mines,
where explosions, cave-ins and flooding killed 3,857 people, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   According to experts, the most accident-prone factories are those
that make metal and plastic tubes, casings and other components for
goods ranging from DVD players to automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   Misreporting and cover-ups by local officials mean that the real
death toll from accidents is probably much higher than reported
figures, Xu said. He said the report also fails to include deaths
from work-related diseases such as lung illnesses from inhaling
industrial chemicals or coal dust.</TE>
<TE>   About 10,000 people die every year from such causes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The current disregard for safety is rooted in the same feature
that makes this nation of 1.3 billion such an export power -- its
almost unlimited supply of cheap labor.</TE>
<TE>   Workers are so plentiful, and paid so little, that factory owners
regard them as easier to replace than machinery, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Guangdong, a prosperous export center, is one of China's most
accident-plagued areas.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, more than 30,000 workers in the province's more than 1
million factories and small workshops lose fingers or entire limbs in
machinery accidents, according to an investigation by the state-owned
newspaper 21st Century Business Herald.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those maimed can't find new work and have no disability
insurance or other social safety net to fall back on. He Qun hasn't
had a job since losing her right hand in 1998. She relies on the
charity of friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   She said the factory, a Chinese-Japanese joint venture in the city
of Longhua in Guangdong, paid her 3,000 yuan after the accident --
the equivalent of five months' salary, or $350. She said managers
told her to go back to her hometown in the poor southwestern province
of Sichuan. Since then, they've refused to answer her calls and
evicted her when she visited.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the factory said workers are given adequate
safety training. She said she knew of He Qun's injury but refused to
discuss it. Several workers at the factory have been injured in the
past, she acknowledged, saying: "Most injuries are caused by their
own carelessness."</TE>
<TE>   He is suing for about $12,500. "For the rest of my life, I can't
do anything," said He, who has a fourth-grade education. "I can't
find work with just one hand."</TE>

<HD>Few Queue Up to Replace Paris Kiosk Operators</HD>
<DH>Employment: They spend long hours on their feet and get few
vacations. Young people don't aspire to the newsstand jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGELA DOLAND</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Jean-Louis Grimal starts work at 5 a.m. inside his newsstand and
closes shop 15 hours later. He eats lunch in the few square feet
behind the cluttered counter. He doesn't take breaks.</LD>
<LD>   He's even there every holiday, except for the May Day celebration
for workers.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a hard life," said Grimal, who has spent 30 years working in
the city's news kiosks -- the green metal huts that are almost as
emblematic of the Paris streets as the wrought-iron Art Nouveau signs
that beckon commuters into the subway.</LD>
<TE>   Grimal is planning to retire at the end of the year, and there
might be no one to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   As Paris kiosk workers retire or quit, few young people are
applying for the jobs. In just three years, the number of kiosks in
the capital has dropped from about 370 to 310.</TE>
<TE>   Grimal, like other kiosk keepers, is paid solely on commission. He
spends entire days on his feet.</TE>
<TE>   The job does have its attractions: You're your own boss. You're
part of the neighborhood's life and rhythms. And you get to read all
the papers and magazines you want.</TE>
<TE>   But in a country where the standard workweek has been shortened to
35 hours, few are attracted to a trade that requires twice as many.</TE>
<TE>   "In our society, people have more vacations and work less," said
Stephane Bribard, spokesman for NMPP, a French press distribution
service. For kiosk vendors, "it's just the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   It's also getting harder to earn money. In France, as elsewhere,
the printed press is losing consumers to TV and Internet news.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a new threat -- the arrival of free papers, financed
solely by advertising and filled with celebrity and sports news. Two
made their debut earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   One Parisian vendor, Gwenael Bizien, says his sales of daily
newspapers have dropped 15% to 20% since free papers became
available. He watches, irate, as newsboys for the free papers set up
their carts every day at a subway exit just a few steps from his
stand.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone's giving you a paper, why would you buy one?" Bizien
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with all these problems, unions, distributors and City Hall
-- which owns the news kiosks and rents them out -- are working on
ways to keep them open.</TE>
<TE>   The committee has come up with an aid package for newsstands with
the lowest revenues. But that's only a short-term solution.</TE>
<TE>   Unions say those who run the newsstands need to be reimbursed more
for each sale. As things stand, the kiosks get a commission of about
18% per sale. In contrast, the Relay news chain, which has stores in
airports and train stations, earns more than 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem: The existing system makes it hard for young
people to break into the business.</TE>
<TE>   Newsstand applicants need to show savings of about $15,000 to
prove to City Hall that they can afford to stock a kiosk. And
newcomers are offered newsstands that nobody else wants because
they're not lucrative.</TE>
<TE>   Not all European news vendors are under the same pressures. Greece
has 11,000 kiosks, and some even operate around-the-clock. In the
Hungarian capital of Budapest, run-down communist-era newsstands are
being replaced with decorative stands whose design was chosen in a
city-sponsored competition.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Paris, some kiosks in the capital's wealthy, busy western
neighborhoods are quite profitable. A few successful kiosk keepers
can even afford to hire an employee so they can cut their hours;
others share the job with their spouse.</TE>
<TE>   It takes years to build the seniority to win a choice spot. After
17 years in the business, Bizien has a well-placed kiosk that brings
him substantially more than the $570 a month he earned in his first
few jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But the hours are still long, and sometimes he gets frustrated by
little things. On a recent afternoon, three people in a row stopped
to ask for directions without buying anything.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, Bizien wasn't even able to point the way.</TE>
<TE>   "When do I ever get a chance to get to know the neighborhood?" he
asked. "I'm always at work."</TE>

<HD>Sherpas Learn the Ropes in Austria's Alps</HD>
<DH>Mountaineering: The Nepalese climbers are tutored in
safety, environmental consciousness and modern inn-keeping.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE JAHN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>HINTERSTODER, Austria</DL>
<LD>Nepal's Sherpas helped conquer Everest, but Hans Gapp remains
convinced that the world's best mountaineers have something to learn
at Austria's lower altitudes from alpinists like himself.</LD>
<LD>   How to tie a knot, for instance.</LD>
<LD>   "First you go over," Gapp says as his Nepalese students sit
beneath a 7,218-foot sheer cliff in the Austrian Alps watching as he
guides a rope into a pattern. "Then, you go under and you go through,
making a figure eight -- a very important knot."</LD>
<TE>   Important, Gapp says, because half a century after Sherpa Tenzing
Norgay helped Sir Edmund Hillary scale Mt. Everest, the world's
highest mountain, many Sherpas still don't know how to tie knots
useful for climbing and other tricks that could save dozens of lives
a year.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very good climbers," said Gapp, one of a group of
volunteers teaching this year's Nepalese visitors a three-month
course on mountain safety, environmental consciousness and modern
Alpine inn keeping. "But for the most part, they have no clue of
climbing safely."</TE>
<TE>   Chief organizer Gertrude Reinisch started bringing members of the
Sherpa ethnic group and other Nepalese to Austria six years ago after
she went trekking in the Himalayas and heard reports of needless
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The Sherpas are training around the Prielschutzhaus Lodge above
Hinterstoder, about 35 miles south of Linz.</TE>
<TE>   Reinisch recalls a Sherpa who risked his life to save a friend of
hers who had fallen into a glacier crack but then died himself months
later by tumbling into another fissure. Both times he was not secured
by a rope, she says.</TE>
<TE>   "They say the gods are responsible for avalanches," she said while
taking a break from videotaping the visitors practicing the
figure-eight knot on a sun-drenched patio 5,250 feet above sea level.
"Bad weather is also the gods' fault."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the idea that Austrians can teach Himalayans anything about
mountains might seem a bit strange.</TE>
<TE>   After all, the Grossglockner, Austria's highest peak, is less than
half the height of the Himalayan giants that include the 29,035-foot
Everest, first scaled May 29, 1953, by Norgay and Hillary.</TE>
<TE>   And while mountain climbing is at most a hobby in Austria, it is a
way of life for the Sherpas. Nepal straddles the world's highest
mountain chain, and tourism is the country's top foreign currency
earner, bringing in about half a million visitors and $160 million a
year.</TE>
<TE>   But visitors also bring problems.</TE>
<TE>   Booming tourism has led to deforestation as villagers cut down
trees to cook, heat and build. Although village women think nothing
of lining up for hours at a well, Westerners demand showers and flush
toilets, contributing to chronic water shortages.</TE>
<TE>   And many trekkers leave the mountains polluted with trash --
environmental critics call Everest the world's highest garbage dump,
strewn with old tents, cans, plastic wrappers and empty oxygen cans.</TE>
<TE>   The Nepalese themselves acknowledge that they need help.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, we have big mountains," said Kaji Sherpa, 27, one of those
literally learning the ropes here. "But we don't have the technical
expertise to climb those mountains, how to rescue those who fall."</TE>
<TE>   Yogesh Ray Shahi, 23, says his main interest is environmental
awareness.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have your technology," he said. "But we can learn to use
other means -- for example, recycling, separating garbage,
composting."</TE>
<TE>   The Nepali visitors' concern for the environment grows as they
help out with cooking, cleaning and repair work at high-altitude
lodges in Austria. But first comes the hurdle of dealing with
showers, flush toilets and light switches.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the women who come here have never left their villages;
most have never even seen a car," Reinisch said. "Some don't know how
to turn off a light. We've had cases where we had to forcibly take
their dirty laundry away from them before they started washing in the
nearest creek."</TE>
<TE>   Gapp, 44, says fear of the unknown is a major obstacle for some of
the visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "They live in a different world," he said. "They say yes to
everything because they're afraid to say no. But they're over that by
the time they leave."</TE>
<TE>   The real benefit to the Sherpas comes from learning the importance
of washing vegetables, cleaning with the minimum amount of detergent,
and avoiding plastic and metal containers that have to be lugged down
from the heights.</TE>
<TE>   "Their education starts with the bus ride from Vienna, when we
explain to them that throwing that candy wrapper out the window
contributes to pollution," said Reinisch, a journalist and adventure
filmmaker. "They look outside, see clean streams and meadows, and
make the connection very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Both Reinisch and the visitors say the program has had a ripple
effect, benefiting not only some 200 Nepalese -- mostly Sherpas --
who have taken the Austrian program, but Nepal itself. Once home, the
graduates spread the word about what they've learned.</TE>
<TE>   "All society is learning from us," said Ganga Bhadur Tamang, 30.
"We hope to make our country clean and [more] beautiful one day."</TE>
<TE>   Wangchau, a Nepalese who uses only one name and settled in the
Alps nine years ago, says he sees the effects of the program whenever
he goes home to visit.</TE>
<TE>   "The young people are now cleaning the mountains, collecting the
garbage," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With their steady and uncomplaining approach to work, the Sherpas
provide some lessons of their own to their lodge owner hosts,
Reinisch says.</TE>
<TE>   "Many say the Nepalese have taught them to deal better with
pressure during high season," she said. "They've become less nervous
-- and, as a result, more friendly to the tourists."</TE>

<DH>Environment: Inupiat hunters' island home faces inundation,
forcing a debate on relocation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHISHMAREF, Alaska</DL>
<LD>Stripped to his shirt sleeves on a desolate polar beach, the Inupiat
Eskimo hunter gazes over his Arctic world.</LD>
<LD>   The midnight sun glitters on navy waves surrounding his island
village. The town sits amid the ruins of dugouts that his ancestors
chipped from the permafrost when pharaohs were erecting pyramids in
the hot sands of Egypt.</LD>
<LD>   His children and their cousins play tag on a hummock where his
wife's parents and their parents are buried.</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of years ago, hungry nomads chased caribou here across a
now-lost land bridge from Siberia, just 100 miles away. Many
scientists believe that those nomads became the first Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Now their descendants are about to become global warming refugees.
Their village is about to be swallowed up by the sea.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no room left here," said Tony Weyiouanna, 43. "I have to
think about my grandchildren. We need to move."</TE>
<TE>   Weather dictates survival in the Arctic. Always it has been the
fearsome cold that meant life or death. Now, Native Alaskans are
alarmed by a noticeable warming trend.</TE>
<TE>   Average temperatures in the Arctic have risen more than 4 degrees
since 1971 -- about the same time, coincidentally, that the first
snowmobile made an appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Weyiouanna still remembers: "It was mind-boggling to see a sled
move without dogs pulling it."</TE>
<TE>   Snowmobile aside, this is still a very rustic village. Its forlorn
breakwater of sandbags, tires and rusting vehicles is often breached
by storms. Recently, four homes tumbled into the sea as villagers
huddled in the Lutheran church.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel and water tanks teeter just a few strides from the brink.
Another gale or two and the entire island -- half a mile at its
widest, 10 feet at its highest -- could be inundated.</TE>
<TE>   Weyiouanna's ancestors simply would have loaded their dogsleds and
mushed inland. But in modern times, moving a town means that
Shishmaref's 600 residents must vote.</TE>
<TE>   It will cost at least $100 million, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers says.</TE>
<TE>   It's a staggering sum even by standards of Shishmaref, where a
light bulb costs $10 at the Nayokpuk Trading Co. (They're down the
aisle from the Pringles and the wolf pelts.)</TE>
<TE>   Residents figure that the government will pay, although state and
federal officials say no relocation fund exists.</TE>
<TE>   It's an upheaval many Americans might face in coming decades.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the Bush administration submitted a report to the United
Nations acknowledging for the first time that climate change is real
and unavoidable. The administration recommends adapting.</TE>
<TE>   Still unresolved is whether rising temperatures are caused by
smokestacks and traffic jams pumping more heat-trapping emissions
into the atmosphere. Or, maybe it's natural variations in the complex
relationship between the oceans, the atmosphere and the sun. Maybe
it's a little of each.</TE>
<TE>   In Alaska, signs of warming are everywhere. In some spots above
the Arctic Circle, average winter temperatures have spiked 10 degrees
since 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Sea ice volume has declined 15% and thinned from 10 feet to 6 feet
in places. With the ice go staple foods -- whale, walrus, seal and
waterfowl, even polar bear.</TE>
<TE>   Glaciers are retreating by 15% and losing half their thickness
every decade. Alaska meltwater accounts for half the worldwide sea
level rise of 7.8 inches in the last 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   Disease and insects encouraged by warmer weather are savaging
millions of acres of Alaskan evergreens.</TE>
<TE>   Melting permafrost is buckling roadways and utility poles. The
aging 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline needs buttressing.</TE>
<TE>   Not that a little global warming would be entirely bad.</TE>
<TE>   An ice-free Arctic would offer new fisheries and faster shipping.
Oil exploration would be easier and farmers could grow more crops.</TE>
<TE>   Barrow, population 4,500, the crossroads of the Eskimo world,
enjoys conveniences made possible from oil revenues. Its niceties
include running water, indoor plumbing, paved roads, jet service and
tourist hotels.</TE>
<TE>   But even with the continent's northernmost Mexican restaurant,
Pepe's, Barrow remains a subsistence community at heart.</TE>
<TE>   Bowhead whale skulls the size of delivery trucks stand in silent
shoreline tribute to the sea and lost crews.</TE>
<TE>   This year, hunters complain of having to travel 30 miles to find
prey. The longer trips burn more fuel and expose them to more danger
as the ice melts and drifts offshore. Rescue aircraft have already
plucked 100 stranded hunters this year.</TE>
<TE>   The spring whale hunt yielded just three bowhead, and one of those
kills was catapulted into the sea when the ice snapped.</TE>
<TE>   One summer morning, rumors of nearby seal and walrus ricochet
through town.</TE>
<TE>   Men hustle from their offices to haul boats to the water's edge.
Schoolchildren bicycle along the beach, cradling rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Offshore, the concussion of what locals call "combat hunting"
thumps for hours as the ghostly shadows of outboard launches swerve
between shimmering icebergs. Then the real work begins.</TE>
<TE>   In his gravel yard, Eugene Brower unfolds a table padded with
layers of grease-soaked cardboard and duct tape.</TE>
<TE>   He is surrounded by four walrus shot that morning, their whiskered
heads still sporting ivory tusks.</TE>
<TE>   Gripping a long knife, he carves out slabs of purple meat.</TE>
<TE>   Then he saws the glistening tan blubber. Each fist-sized chunk --
fat, skin and brown furry hide -- is tossed into plastic pails for
rendering.</TE>
<TE>   "In this heat, it should go fast," Brower explained, his knife
never pausing. "We eat it all. It's good for you. I've got 11
grandkids. I need to put meat on their tables."</TE>
<TE>   Brower, 56, attended Indian school and worked at a national
laboratory in Idaho handling radioactive material before returning to
raise his first set of sons, now grown.</TE>
<TE>   He mops his round face and bristly mustache with his T-shirt.
"When it hit 70 this week, my neighbor bought a fan," he said with a
chortle.</TE>
<TE>   His 3-year-old adopted son, Andrew, frolics next to a boat that
Brower made with sealskins. When Andrew raps the boat with his
knuckles, it vibrates like a drum.</TE>
<TE>   A skin boat, called an "umiaq," should be seaworthy for a decade.
In this heat, it may not last until Andrew's first hunt five years
hence.</TE>
<TE>   The wisdom that Brower shares with Andrew will be different from
what he taught his older sons.</TE>
<TE>   "The ice is thinner. The air is warmer," Brower said. "When you
are out on the ice, you can see the steam rising. And that's
something you don't want to see behind you."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Shishmaref, the danger stares Tony Weyiouanna in the face.</TE>
<TE>   The sea constantly gnaws at the sandbar's underbelly. At low tide,
children play on the sandbag wall shoring up their jungle gym.
Growling bulldozers keep pushing more sand into the tide's path.</TE>
<TE>   The Army has a $3-million plan to rebuild the island's leading
edge with barge loads of rock. But the money can only be used for
erosion control, not relocation. The Corps offers to design a
breakwater that is more effective, more progressive.</TE>
<TE>   The other option is to move.</TE>
<TE>   On a July morning, three village women open the bingo hall and
stretch the Stars and Stripes across the wall. They unfold two
portable metal voting booths and tack a sample ballot to the door.</TE>
<TE>   It reads: "Do you want to relocate the Community of Shishmaref?"</TE>
<TE>   To vote, "Mark an X to the right of Yes or No."</TE>
<TE>   No dangling chads here.</TE>
<TE>   An hour ticks by. Winfred Obruk, who runs the village generator,
wanders in. He drops his ballot into the locked box, tapping the lid
twice for emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   At 63, he says he is ready to abandon the only home he's known.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing else we can do," Obruk said. "The storms make you
feel kind of small. It feels odd to move, but that's nature."</TE>
<TE>   For a valid referendum, Shishmaref needs 40% of its 341 registered
voters to cast ballots.</TE>
<TE>   The village's median age is about 20. Most youths stay up late
hunting, playing video games or cruising the beach on ATVs. By
midafternoon, some were rousted to vote. They want to go anywhere, it
seems.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to school on the mainland," said Leona Goodhope, 19, "and
when I came back, my house was gone. They moved it to the other side
of the village, or it would've fallen in."</TE>
<TE>   A new village would probably have indoor plumbing, trash
collection and upgraded telecommunications for better e-mail and
television, in addition to protection from surly climate change.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is eager. Sixty-year-old Clifford Weyiouanna pointed
to recent improvements -- a school addition, a tannery, an automated
laundry.</TE>
<TE>   And what about the cemetery?</TE>
<TE>   "My mother and grandmother are in there," he said. "This is where
they were born and lived. I think maybe they should stay here."</TE>
<TE>   At 8 p.m., the election judges put down their copy of the National
Enquirer to hand-count the ballots. Outside, a crowd gathered for
Bingo.</TE>
<TE>   The vote: 161-20. Shishmaref will move.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody cheered.</TE>
<TE>   The island still could be used as a summer fishing camp, Tony
Weyiouanna said. He will become a bureaucrat and coordinate
relocation planning.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be putting money into the move," he said, "and not
pouring it into the sea."</TE>
<TE>   The vote means the release of $1 million in federal funds to
examine the relocation's effect on potential mainland sites.</TE>
<TE>   How the $100-million relocation itself would be funded is a
question for the state and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The favored spot for this expensive move?</TE>
<TE>   Five miles east.</TE>

<HD>Forensics 'Geeks' Are Cool Now</HD>
<DH>Science: The CBS hit 'CSI' has turned crime scene
investigators into instant celebrities. Colleges rush to cash in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RYAN PEARSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>The macabre curiosity that prompted Rebecca Leonard to scoop squashed
frogs from roadways as a youngster had always baffled and disgusted
her friends.</LD>
<LD>   "They always thought I was weird, you know," she said. "They
didn't want to talk about it. I was always trying to justify it to
them."</LD>
<LD>   Today, she doesn't have to; they're brimming with questions.</LD>
<TE>   For the most part, she can credit CBS' surprising hit series "CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation," a slick TV show set in Las Vegas that
transformed the grisly minutiae of forensics into a who-done-it drama
starring handsome scientists and cutting-edge technology.</TE>
<TE>   Like thousands of others once considered "police nerds," the
32-year-old Leonard, a forensic science intern with the Sheriff's
Department crime lab in Marin County, has become an instant celebrity
of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, it's really cool, what I do. It's like this
glamorous thing," she said. "All my friends are asking all these
questions: 'What was the crime scene like? Did you analyze the DNA?'
"</TE>
<TE>   Crime scene investigators and police forensic experts have emerged
from the proverbial basement lab in recent years, propelled by the
show, Sept. 11 recovery identification efforts and their own
proficiency at solving older crimes through new technology.</TE>
<TE>   Colleges are rushing to cash in, and forensic-science education is
hotter than any other crime-related field.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,500 forensic-identification scientists from throughout
the nation and 27 countries took time at the start of a recent Las
Vegas convention to indulge in their newfound celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Zuiker, creator of "CSI" and its fall spinoff set in
Miami, peppered his convention keynote speech with references to
Hollywood producers and actors. He even previewed his acceptance
speech should the show, which consistently tops Nielsen TV ratings,
win any of the six Emmys for which it is nominated.</TE>
<TE>   His words were well received by the distinctly non-Hollywood crowd
-- a mix of former beat cops in dark business suits, the pale and
sometimes disheveled back-room scientists and about 100 students like
Leonard.</TE>
<TE>   Those assembled said the best thing about Zuiker's show and
Patricia Cornwell's crime novels -- including "The Last Precinct" and
"Body of Evidence" -- is the opportunity it gives them to talk shop
without feeling like death-obsessed mad scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "I always felt like such a freak. But now my friends are asking if
I've read the latest Cornwell book, and was it true to life," Leonard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in forensic science before "CSI" grew through
medical-examiner fiction and the 1976-83 TV drama "Quincy." Highly
publicized court cases, most famously the 1995 O.J. Simpson trial,
kept the field in the public eye.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the Discovery Channel launched "The New Detectives," a
series that reenacts real forensic-science investigations. It is now
the second most watched show on the channel and served as the
creative spark for "CSI."</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11, shifting the focus for the public and the
police from crime to recovery. The same techniques used by
crime-scene investigators to find clues were put to work identifying
victims of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Crime-scene investigator John Cantone of the New York Police
Department said it was one of the first times his team had focused
only on identifying victims.</TE>
<TE>   "We already knew what happened," Cantone said. "We just needed to
identify. And we quickly got really good at it."</TE>
<TE>   Although their new high profile is flattering, some forensic
analysts say it also has made their jobs more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Smith, retired as regional director of the Mississippi Crime
Lab, said jurors inundated with crime-scene TV fiction and movies
expect more from expert testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "It's caused us to be better at articulating that information to
people that really don't know what we do, but think they do," the
forensics consultant and trainer said. Cantone said the increased use
of lasers, DNA testing and fiber analysis -- and their coverage on TV
-- has placed unrealistic expectations on forensic scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "We go out into the community and they think that things can be
done very quickly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vendors at the Las Vegas convention tempted budget-crunched
scientists with products ranging from high-tech LED forensic light
systems to classic brown paper evidence bags.</TE>
<TE>   In between the latest face-recognition software and a portable
automated fingerprint scanner, a Swedish scientist hawked a prototype
black liquid designed specifically to lift fingerprints from the
sticky side of tape.</TE>
<TE>   Although most crime scene investigators make do with limited
budgets and only several select "toys," the use of technology has
been key to their recent heightened productivity -- and status.</TE>
<TE>   The latest software can link whorls, loops and peaks on two
fingerprints with only a small portion of the print detected. Glen
Calhoun, fingerprint analysis director of the Miami-Dade Police
Department, said such technology has helped solve about 300 "cold
cases" there over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The technology and analytical problem-solving involved in such
efforts is what has attracted 28-year-old Irma Hernandez and a
growing number of other young people to the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the mystery of it," said Hernandez, whose crime-scene
classes at Southwestern College in Chula Vista went from half-full to
standing room within months after "CSI" made its debut.</TE>
<TE>   Although many crime-scene investigators had little formal training
in sciences, college degrees have become the norm for young
investigators, said Diane Do, director of the San Diego County
Sheriff's forensics internship program. And they're getting
competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 200 people graduated from colleges in 2000 with bachelor's
or master's degrees in forensic studies, up from 79 in 1995,
according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Such
numbers seem tiny, but forensic studies is among the fastest-growing
academic fields, easily outpacing other "protective services"
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Applications for 20 slots in the forensic science master's program
at Michigan State University jumped from 97 in 2001 to 147 this year.
Similar numbers are found at other colleges, and smaller schools are
rushing to cash in, said Max Houck of West Virginia University.</TE>

<HD>Erosion Threatens Birds' Nesting Sites</HD>
<DH>Nature: Trees on island home of egrets, herons are losing
their foothold and falling into the river. Double-crested cormorants
also are moving in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN LEWERENZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARRISBURG, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Two black-crowned night herons sit on a tree that has crashed from
Wade Island into the Susquehanna River. It's a windy day and the tree
provides a sheltered perch for the birds, which typically hunt at
night.</LD>
<LD>   But the tree's fall is the latest sign that the herons and their
neighbors, great egrets, may be in danger.</LD>
<LD>   Visible from the Interstate 81 bridge, Wade Island sits just a few
feet from the Harrisburg city limits. Yet despite the birds'
proximity to the city, it's not humans who threaten their continued
existence in Pennsylvania. It's the river itself, and the other birds
that the river has attracted.</LD>
<TE>   Erosion has taken about one-third of the small island's area,
causing the trees that house the birds to crash into the river. All
the while, double-crested cormorants -- a thriving species that is
expanding its habitat -- are starting to crowd the egrets and herons
from their traditional nesting sites.</TE>
<TE>   The result may be the end of Pennsylvania's only nesting site for
great egrets and one of just a handful of sites for black-crowned
night herons.</TE>
<TE>   Egrets were once common along eastern rivers, but their graceful,
snowy-white feathers were sought by hunters, who sold them for
decorations.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, it did nest more places," said Cindy Dunn,
executive director of the Pennsylvania Audubon Society. "Their
numbers are still rebounding from the turn of the century, when their
numbers were decimated by the plume trade, the hat trade."</TE>
<TE>   With its towering silver maple and river birch, Wade Island
provides ideal nesting for great egrets, a state endangered species,
and black-crowned night herons, considered at risk in the state. The
clear, shallow water of the Susquehanna affords ample food for both
species of wading birds.</TE>
<TE>   Wade Island has shrunk to just 2.5 acres, from about 3.8 acres in
1985. As the river washes away the edges of the island, trees lose
their footholds and crash into the river, decreasing the available
nesting space.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the egret and heron nests, Wade isn't that much
different from nearby Sheets Island or the smaller islands that make
up the Sheets Island Archipelago, which also provides habitat for
yellow-crowned night herons, blue herons and other species.</TE>
<TE>   So why haven't the egrets and black-crowns expanded to nearby
islands?</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we've been trying to figure out," said Cal
Butchkoski, a game technician with the Pennsylvania Game Commission.
"Some of the other islands have similar trees. But some of it is
history. The young come back -- and so do the adults -- to the same
spot, and they get attached to it."</TE>
<TE>   And another species is becoming attached to Wade Island.
Double-crested cormorants, more common along the Eastern Seaboard,
have begun expanding up the Susquehanna, drawn by its plentiful food
supply.</TE>
<TE>   "Pennsylvania was not thought to be double-crested cormorant
habitat, and you wouldn't expect to really see them. They dive 20 to
40 feet deep to eat fish, so you'd never think they'd take off in the
Susquehanna," Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   But the cormorants are thriving, and their expanding populations
need new places to feed. And they're adapting, learning to eat from
the shallow waters of the Susquehanna instead of the deeper waters
that they're used to.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it may have been the success of the egret and heron
colony on Wade that attracted the cormorants.</TE>
<TE>   "Colonial nesters intuitively attract other colonial nesters
because they recognize there's safety in numbers," said Dan Brauning,
a Game Commission biologist. "But in this case, that's unfortunate,
because Wade has limited -- in fact, eroding -- accommodations."</TE>
<TE>   That's bad news for the wading birds. Although the species don't
really compete for food, the cormorants do compete for nesting space
with the egrets and herons. It's a competition that the wading birds
aren't likely to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Cormorants can form some fairly large colonies and if that occurs
here, there's a good possibility they could take over the nesting
habitat on the island," Butchkoski said. "They're more aggressive
than these wading birds and once they set their nest, that's their
area. The egrets and the herons aren't going to push them off.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't noticed any aggression toward the existing nests of
egrets and herons from the cormorants. But the trees that the
cormorants are in, in the past, they had egrets there. They're
definitely displacing some of the egret and heron nests."</TE>
<TE>   Some 249 egret and heron nests exist on Wade Island, down from
almost 400 in 1990, but still substantially higher than in the early
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Although cormorant populations are strong, as a migratory bird,
they are protected by federal law. Because of that, the state would
need permission from the federal government before taking any action
that would hurt the birds.</TE>
<TE>   But Butchkoski said the state is not yet at that point. For now,
officials will simply monitor the birds and do what they can to
encourage the herons and egrets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're happy with the numbers right now when you figure
that there's only so much habitat," Butchkoski said.</TE>

<HD>Lives, Loves Intertwined in Letters</HD>
<DH>History: 19th century correspondence chronicles a family
and a Maine congressman who died in a duel. Material is included in a
new book.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN ADAMS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>THOMASTON, Maine</DL>
<LD>Jonathan Cilley, a young congressman from Maine, stood at the ready
with his pistol at his side nearly 100 yards from his challenger in a
field outside Washington, D.C. The date of the duel was Feb. 24,
1838.</LD>
<LD>   Cilley, who had no particular dislike for his opponent,
intentionally fired the first shot into the ground. Additional rounds
were ordered. After the third, Cilley lay mortally wounded in the
frozen field, leaving a wife and three young children back home in
Thomaston.</LD>
<LD>   Much of Cilley's life leading up to its tragic end -- and the
lives of his survivors and descendants -- have been reconstructed
from a cache of letters that had been preserved in almost pristine
condition by the family for generations.</LD>
<TE>   The 500 longhand letters, occasionally written on top of earlier
correspondence to save paper that was so precious at the time, have
been painstakingly deciphered over five years by historian Eve
Anderson and a small team of owl-eyed assistants.</TE>
<TE>   Now appearing in a book, "A Breach of Privilege, Cilley Family
Letters 1820-1867," they paint a detailed and personal portrait of a
Maine family in words no outsider could have chosen. The $49.95
volume is published locally by Seven Coin Press.</TE>
<TE>   The letters fell into Anderson's hands after a descendant of
Cilley's e-mailed her at the Thomaston Historical Society, where she
is president, and asked if she would be interested in transcribing
them.</TE>
<TE>   Intertwined within the pages are themes of family love, religious
tensions, political corruption, broken friendships, the prevalence of
disease and what turns out to be a planned killing of a promising
young politician. Cilley's duel created such a public outcry that it
resulted in a law to end the practice.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, interviewed in her 1800s home just down the street from
the Cilley home that remains occupied to this day, said her book
should be seen as more than a dusty collection of letters of interest
only to history buffs and scholars.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the book to be looked at as a novel that happened to be
true," said Anderson, who studied English literature and history in
college, and was a stringer for her local newspaper while rearing her
children at home in Connecticut. She and her husband retired to
Maine.</TE>
<TE>   Cilley was born in 1802 in Nottingham, N.H. As a young man, he
came to Maine to attend Bowdoin College in Brunswick, where his
classmates and friends included author Nathaniel Hawthorne, distant
cousin poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and President Franklin Pierce.</TE>
<TE>   In passages that would sound familiar to any parent with children
in college today, Cilley requested money again and again to meet his
expenses. He wrote that he had fallen in love -- "yes, that is in
LOVE -- deep in love -- up to the verry (sic) tip of my nose in Love
-- which, you know, tips down a little."</TE>
<TE>   And in a curious play on words that eerily foreshadowed his doom,
Cilley wrote of a housemate who entered his room with "a pistol
heavily loaded and pointing it exactly at me." Only later did he
reveal that he was referring to an "a-pis-tol," or epistle, a letter
from home.</TE>
<TE>   As time went on, the tone became more serious as politics became a
central part of Cilley's life. He expressed pride in his native state
in 1832 as it presented "an undivided front for [Andrew] Jackson and
[Martin] Van Buren."</TE>
<TE>   Writing to his wife Deborah Prince from Augusta, where he served
as speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, Cilley referred to
his enemies and expressed hope that God will "give me wisdom &amp;
strength sufficient for every trial."</TE>
<TE>   Serving in Washington after he was elected to the U.S. House,
Cilley's exchanges with his wife, who showed signs of tuberculosis
and bipolar disorder, reflected an unflinching devotion to her and
his children. He described the splendors of the nation's capital in
colorful detail.</TE>
<TE>   As North-South antagonisms grew, a plot was hatched to silence the
rising young abolitionist from Maine. A remark by Cilley on the House
floor, in which he alluded to a bribe to a New York newspaper
publisher, gave Cilley's enemies the opportunity they sought.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky Congressman William Graves was goaded into challenging
Cilley to a duel. Cilley, while he disapproved of such action and
liked Graves, said New England honor was at stake and agreed. The two
met on a field in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   After the first two shots were exchanged and a third was demanded,
Cilley turned to an associate and said, "They thirst for my blood,"
according to a letter from Pierce to Deborah's brother, Hezekiah
Prince Jr.</TE>
<TE>   A letter that was written 180 degrees across an earlier letter as
a way to save paper took a month to transcribe. Other letters were
written in the margins of previous ones.</TE>
<TE>   The quality of penmanship told the transcribers a lot about the
writers, Anderson said. "You could see Debbie's writing deteriorate
because of her tuberculosis."</TE>
<TE>   The letters chronicle the growth and maturation of the Cilleys'
three surviving children -- Greenleaf, Prince and Julia -- from the
time Greenleaf first picked up a pen through their college years and
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Letters from Prince, who was called Prin, highlight the
personality similarities between himself and his father. His letters
are among the few that refer to Jonathan Cilley after his death.
Greenleaf went on to become a naval commander and Prin a brigadier
general during the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said she tried to let the subjects tell the story of the
Cilley family as much as possible, but she provides sufficient
historical background and interpretation to give the letters
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Although the editors made some changes in punctuation and
paragraphing to make the letters more readable, original spelling and
grammar were retained for the sake of authenticity. One of the
transcribers is an expert in 19th-century expressions.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the earlier letters are written in cumbersome and complex
grammatical style, but as the years passed and language evolved, the
writings become more clipped and direct, with fewer flowing, flowery
expressions.</TE>
<TE>   The letters also reflect a change in outlook between the first
half of the 1800s and the Civil War era, due mostly to advancements
in medicine and transportation, and new inventions that made life
easier.</TE>
<TE>   "The original letters showed that people thought they were being
put on Earth to be tested and see how much they could manage to
survive through," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "But their general outlook even during the war was more upbeat.
They saw a better future. Life was getting easier for them," she
said. "The tone of the letters was optimistic."</TE>

<HD>Residents in Coal Country Fight Opening of New Mine</HD>
<DH>Environment: As old seams are played out, companies look
nearer towns for new supplies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER ALFORD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LICK CREEK, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Susan Skeens and other folks in Lick Creek sprang into action when a
coal company moved to open a mine near their homes in this little
Appalachian community where the loudest sound at night is often the
mournful call of a whippoorwill.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything I have will be covered with black dust," said Skeens,
whose home is some 250 feet from the proposed entrance to the mine.</LD>
<LD>   Lick Creek's battle to stop the project may be the first of many
to come in Kentucky as older coal mines are played out and mining
companies move closer to populated areas to dig.</LD>
<TE>   In the past, Kentucky's coal was typically mined deep in the
mountains where coal seams were thickest and easiest to dig out.</TE>
<TE>   But after a century of heavy mining, "the easy coal is gone," said
Tom FitzGerald, an environmental attorney representing Lick Creek
residents. "Coal seams that once were considered marginal or
problematic now are being mined. Often, they're close to homes."</TE>
<TE>   Roy Mullins, a former coal miner now leading the charge to keep
Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co. from opening the mine in Lick Creek,
said residents across the Appalachian coalfields have a vested
interest in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be their community next," he said. "We're not trying to
shut down a coal company, and we're not trying to put anyone out of
work. But it's time for the communities to take a stand."</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Lick Creek, a community of about 50 homes in a hollow
in eastern Kentucky, have staved off the TECO Coal subsidiary for two
years by obtaining a state ruling that mining would damage well
water.</TE>
<TE>   But TECO spokeswoman Laura Plumb said now that public water lines
have been extended into the community, the state no longer has any
reason to stop the underground mine from opening.</TE>
<TE>   Residents disagree. They fear the dust, noise and other
environmental effects.</TE>
<TE>   Coal mining is a $3.5-billion industry in Kentucky, which ranks
third, behind Wyoming and West Virginia, in tons mined. Kentucky's
15,500 miners produced 131 million tons in 2000 and made more than
$678 million in wages, according to the Kentucky Coal Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Marcum, association vice president, said coal companies try
their best to be good neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   He said the state does not allow coal companies to begin mining
until it is reasonably assured that there would be no harm to
residential areas. If harm does result, Marcum said, government
agencies can step in, imposing fines or even ordering mines to shut
down.</TE>
<TE>   Clashes between homeowners and industry are often attributed to
burgeoning populations and the spread of development into the
countryside. But that does not appear to be the case in Appalachia's
coal country.</TE>
<TE>   The population of eastern Kentucky's impoverished coal-producing
counties dropped significantly during the 1990s, with most of the
decline attributed to an exodus of people looking for work in urban
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Other communities across the region are having to live with mines
edging closer to homes.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of McRoberts blame a nearby mountaintop mine for
recurrent flash flooding. Others complain that blasting shakes their
homes like daily earthquakes. In the small community of Ary,
residents complain that dust covers their homes, furniture, even the
trees. Earlier this month, authorities evacuated 12 homes at Brushy
when blasting sent rocks down a mountainside; one boulder destroyed a
mobile home.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howard said a mine near Viper is causing his house to
sink, and subjects his family to the roar of machinery and the
beeping of heavy equipment moving in reverse.</TE>
<TE>   "It's miserable," he said. "When I first bought property here, it
was just so peaceful, so quiet. Now you can't sit outside in the
evening. The noise is totally irritating."</TE>

<HD>Old Elevators Blamed in Children's Deaths</HD>
<DH>Safety: Analysis shows that at least nine children --
including four in the last four years -- have died. But simple and
inexpensive modifications are available.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLARKE CANFIELD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHEL, Maine</DL>
<LD>The 8-year-old boy's life came to an end with the push of an elevator
button.</LD>
<LD>   While on vacation with his family last year, Tucker Smith stepped
into the space between the outer swinging door and inner collapsible
gate of a 1929 elevator at the Bethel Inn and Country Club. The outer
door closed behind the 60-pound child, trapping him in a 7-inch-deep
space between, just as the elevator was called up.</LD>
<LD>   When it reached the second floor, the elevator shuddered to a
stop. The boy was crushed between the car and the second-floor
landing. He was dead of massive head trauma.</LD>
<TE>   Tucker's death sounds like a freak, unavoidable accident. It was
neither. At least nine children have been killed -- four in the last
four years alone -- after getting trapped between doors of old-style,
swinging-door elevators, an Associated Press analysis has found.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the number of children crushed or suffocated on these
elevators may be higher. The industry has known for decades that the
elevator design, popular before the 1950s, is potentially deadly.
Nonetheless, simple safety modifications recommended more than 15
years ago by engineers who set industry standards have not been
written into regulatory laws in most states. Even where they have,
enforcement is often lax.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows for sure how many swinging-door elevators there are
in the United States, but people in the industry say thousands of
them continue to carry children and adults in apartment houses,
hotels and other buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that there is an easy, simple solution to make them
safe, that's the part that's so troubling to me," said Judith Rodner,
a New Jersey lawyer who represented the family of Shakarr Burwell, 9,
who was killed in a Newark, N.J., elevator in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   The danger can be eliminated by installing a "space guard," a
metal box-like piece that bolts onto an elevator's outer door to fill
up the space between the two doors so that people can't get trapped.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars to make
an elevator safe. We're talking about hundreds of dollars" per door,
Rodner said. "How do you equate that with a child's life?"</TE>
<TE>   Swinging-door elevators represent a small fraction of the
600,000-plus elevators nationwide, which carry 120 billion passengers
annually, according to the Elevator Escalator Safety Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   One of these old models was in the Bethel Inn, a two-story
clapboard inn in western Maine where Jeffrey and Mary Smith of Bel
Air, Md., brought their three children on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 23, 2001, Tucker and his twin sister, Ellie, headed from
their second-floor room to have breakfast in the ground-floor dining
room with their father. Jeffrey Smith, an airline pilot, handed the
room key to his wife as the children made their way down the hallway.</TE>
<TE>   The father slowed in the hallway for two hotel employees in front
of him as Tucker and Ellie scooted downstairs with the idea that
they'd ride the elevator back upstairs to meet their dad and give him
a ride.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker stepped into the space between the two doors. Upstairs, a
maid pushed the elevator button to summon it, and Tucker went with
it, trapped on the outer ledge.</TE>
<TE>   Ellie could see through the small window in the elevator door as
her brother's body disappeared as the elevator moved upward. The
state medical examiner's report includes gruesome details of how the
boy was dragged up as the gap narrowed.</TE>
<TE>   When the door was pried open, Tucker's parents and sisters
witnessed the results, said Terry Garmey, an attorney who represents
the family. Jeffrey Smith stepped into the elevator and cradled his
dead son's bloodied head. The boy's sisters ran shrieking down the
hotel stairs.</TE>
<TE>   "When the family learned Tucker wasn't the first child who died
like this, it became very important to them that he would be the
last," Garmey said.</TE>
<TE>   The Smiths declined to be interviewed for this story, but Mary
Smith, in a letter to the Associated Press, wrote: "We have done our
best to forget the horrific scenes, but it is impossible. It is
something that I do not wish any other family to endure.... We have
promised our two daughters that we will do all we can to prevent
similar accidents; we feel that we have a moral obligation to see
that this lethal hazard is eliminated."</TE>
<TE>   The Smiths are suing the hotel, the company that maintained the
elevator, and Otis Elevator Co. to draw attention to the problem,
Garmey said. Lawyers for Otis Elevator, the Bethel Inn and Pine State
Elevator, the company that serviced and inspected the elevator,
declined to comment on the lawsuit's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Otis manufactured the elevator and installed it in the Bethel Inn
in 1929. The lawsuit contends that the company concealed the history
of injuries and fatalities on swinging-door elevators and didn't
adequately warn the public.</TE>
<TE>   Maine inspectors determined that the Bethel Inn's elevator had 18
deficiencies, such as failure to perform a five-year safety test and
install an alarm. The fatal flaw was the excessive space between the
two doors -- Maine law allows only 4 inches -- that permitted Tucker
to be trapped. "Had the elevator had only a 4-inch gap, instead of 7
inches, the door would not have been able to close on a child."</TE>
<TE>   According to an AP examination of court documents and government
records, as well as interviews with lawyers and elevator experts, the
same type of elevator car has been involved in at least nine
fatalities since 1976 -- all children.</TE>
<TE>   Hubert Hayes, an elevator consultant in New York, believes that
the death count is actually higher --"many more than 10"-- but the
exact number is unknown because nobody tracks such information.</TE>
<TE>   There is no federal oversight of elevators or a national
clearinghouse of information about them. The U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission tracks elevator and escalator injury and death
statistics, but does not have detailed reports of the incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Most cases of swinging-door deaths, Hayes said, receive little
publicity and are settled out of court.</TE>
<TE>   Rodner said most of the deaths have not generated much public
interest because they have occurred in poor, urban high-rises.</TE>
<TE>   Elevator companies have known since the 1930s of the potential
dangers of the elevator cars.</TE>
<TE>   A former director of product safety for Otis Elevator testified
that the potential hazards of the elevator design were known as early
as 1931, according to a court deposition in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "For more than 70 years, Otis Elevator Company has repeatedly
advised customers about the problem posed by the excessive space"
between the elevator doors, the company said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The American Society for Mechanical Engineers, which writes
elevator standards, recommended in its 1955 codes for new passenger
elevators that the gap between the doors should not exceed 4 inches
on swinging-door models.</TE>
<TE>   But the engineers group didn't address older elevators until 1986,
when it issued a new set of standards recommending that existing
swinging-door elevators be equipped with space guards.</TE>
<TE>   Otis Elevator has repeatedly tried to inform elevator owners and
inspectors of the dangers, officials said. Most recently, Otis mailed
44,500 letters in 1995, warning elevator owners that serious injury
or death "is likely to result" if somebody gets trapped between the
two doors and the elevator is called to another floor. The letter
advised elevator owners to install the space guards.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say there's plenty of blame to go around for the problem's
still existing: It is shared by inspectors, government regulators,
elevator manufacturers and owners.</TE>
<TE>   Elevator safety regulations vary greatly among states, cities and
counties. There is also a mishmash of elevator inspection systems
--public and private --in the various jurisdictions.</TE>
<TE>   John Weldin of Weldin Engineering in Bergenfield, N.J., who has
been retained in several court cases involving accidents on
swinging-door elevators, said most places have not adopted the
engineering society standards as law.</TE>
<TE>   "If states and cities would adopt the [most recent] code, you
wouldn't have the condition you're talking about," Weldin said.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason the latest elevator standards have not been adopted in
most places is because of the financial burden they would place on
elevator owners," said Richard Atkinson, executive director of the
National Assn. of Elevator Safety Authorities International, based in
Arizona. And because the latest standards have not been adopted,
there are thousands of elevators that are perfectly legal because
they complied with the laws when installed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   While declining to comment about the Bethel Inn death, Otis
Elevator spokeswoman Tizz Weber said the company's No. 1 priority is
and always has been safety.</TE>
<TE>   "Otis has lobbied for code changes, urged states to adopt the
codes into law, and informed elevator owners of the problem -- and
how to solve it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the company estimated that a space guard would cost $200
to $300 in materials and one "team-hour" of labor for each landing.
Under those guidelines, the cost of space guards for a two-story
building, such as the Bethel Inn, would be $400 to $600 plus labor.
For a 20-story building, it would cost $4,000 to $6,000 plus labor.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes, the elevator consultant, said manufacturers should take
extra steps to address the problem. If an automobile company
manufactures a model that has safety problems, it can be required to
recall cars for repairs, he said. "If somebody knows there is a
potentially dangerous situation, they have an obligation to take care
of it."</TE>
<TE>   Otis' Weber said building owners also have a responsibility to
update their properties -- whether it be with fire alarms, sprinklers
or elevators. How long, she asked, should manufacturers be
responsible for their products?</TE>
<TE>   "Take a 1963 Nova; they didn't have air bags," Weber said. "Should
GM now be responsible for putting air bags in all those cars?"</TE>
<TE>   Enforcement is another issue. Maine is one of the places that
adopted the latest engineering society guidelines back in 1998.
Nonetheless, three years later, after the Bethel Inn accident, state
inspectors shut down 74 elevators in violation of the space
requirement, said Kristine Ossenfort of the Department of
Professional and Financial Regulation. She said she could not explain
why so many elevators were operating illegally.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Turns to the Internet to Recover Stolen Indian
Artifacts</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Officials hope to once again display any of the
returned pottery and figurines taken from a museum in 1974.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT MINOR</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BLAKELY, Ga.</DL>
<LD>About 1,500 years ago, one of North America's largest native American
civilizations thrived amid the longleaf pines of southwestern
Georgia.</LD>
<LD>   The people made human sacrifices, created exquisite pottery,
crafted delicate animal figurines and built an imposing temple mound,
where chiefs and priests presided.</LD>
<LD>   They were unearthed by archeologists in the 1950s, and the state
built a museum into the side of a burial mound to display them.</LD>
<TE>   Over the years, thousands of schoolchildren, tourists and scholars
trekked to the site to learn about the Swift Creek and Weeden Island
Indians, who lived near Blakely from 250 to 950 A.D. But in the dark
of night in March 1974, thieves broke into the museum of Kolomoki
Mounds State Historic Park and took 129 artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of items have been recovered from collectors and flea
markets in Florida and Pennsylvania, but the whereabouts of the bulk
of them remain a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Now park officials are turning to the Internet for help in
recovering the remaining booty from Georgia's most infamous
archeological theft. They've launched a Web site with pictures of the
purloined pottery, asking art collectors, museums and others to help
them gather the stolen merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Bentley, the park's manager, said the theft amounted to grave
robbing: Many of the clay pots and fanciful figurines were made to
honor chiefs and priests who had died.</TE>
<TE>   "From a ceramic technology standpoint, they're absolutely
stunning," said David Crass, Georgia's state archeologist. "They
would compare favorably with anything from the Southwest. Many
incorporate animal shapes. These pots give you a glimpse into how
they saw the world."</TE>
<TE>   Crass said the primary purpose of the Web site is recovery, not
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone has those pots in all innocence, and that happens a
lot, then we would hope they would return them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kolomoki's early inhabitants built a ceremonial plaza and seven
mounds, including two burial mounds and a temple mound that was a
religious center.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the temple mound rises 56 feet above the surrounding pine
forest from a base the size of a football field. Archeologists
believe that it had a temple platform at the top, where chiefs and
priests lived, worshipped and governed.</TE>
<TE>   "The folks who lived at Kolomoki were in some ways very different
from us," Crass said. "But you would have heard kids laughing, dogs
barking, moms yelling at their kids -- the same things we hear in any
neighborhood. Those were real flesh-and-blood people with all the
same kinds of desires and feelings that we have today."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Pluckhahn, an archeologist who has made excavations at
Kolomoki, described it as one of the largest and most densely
populated towns north of Mexico between 350 and 550 A.D. He believes
that there were about 500 full-time residents, with as many as 1,000
more pouring in for ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the mound alignments may be tied to the solstices and
equinoxes," he said. "There was a lot of emphasis on nature and
trying to make sense of people's relationship to nature and death. It
looks like Kolomoki was drawing people from a couple of hundred miles
for ceremonies."</TE>
<TE>   The 1,239-acre site has been a state park since 1938.</TE>
<TE>   Bentley said many of the ceremonial pots had been "killed" so that
they could not be used for any practical purpose. The potters
intentionally gave them holes when they made them or poked holes in
the bottoms later.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a spiritual purpose," Bentley said. "They carried the
spirituality of the one who had died."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's Department of Natural Resources had to close the museum
temporarily after the theft, but today it is open five days a week.</TE>
<TE>   "After the theft, there were only empty cases," Bentley said.
"Everything you see ... was either recovered or on loan. If we had
the pottery back, we could redesign the museum to include the stolen
artifacts. I would put all of them on display."</TE>

<HD>Unclaimed Assets Can Be Boon for Cash-Strapped States</HD>
<DH>Budgets: Idle funds such as bank accounts and uncashed
paychecks are a fast-growing revenue source for governments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As it hunted for cash to balance this year's state budget, New York
tapped into one of its fastest-growing revenue sources -- bank
accounts, stocks and other assets that owners have, for one reason or
another, left behind.</LD>
<LD>   New York's budget includes $408 million in abandoned property to
be scooped up in its current fiscal year, as well as $300 million
from selling unclaimed securities.</LD>
<LD>   None of this money technically belongs to New York. But, like
other states, it becomes custodian through laws requiring businesses
to relinquish assets that haven't been touched for years by the
rightful owners.</LD>
<TE>   Unclaimed property includes a variety of idle assets -- bank and
stock brokerage accounts, uncashed paychecks, life insurance proceeds
and even gift certificates that were never redeemed.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on what it is, personal property is considered abandoned
by states after a specific period of inactivity, ranging from one to
15 years.</TE>
<TE>   People leave behind money for a range of reasons, but
forgetfulness and apathy are probably the most common causes, said
Clive Cohen, senior vice president for the National Abandoned
Property Processing Corp., which helps 47 states and the District of
Columbia find unclaimed assets.</TE>
<TE>   When people move, they often neglect to close bank accounts with
small balances or don't bother to pick up a final paycheck from some
menial job, Cohen said. Banks typically turn over the most unclaimed
property, partly because they are among the country's most regulated
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   States can use the cash until the rightful owners or their heirs
reclaim these assets -- and, in most instances, no one ever does,
even though there aren't any statutes of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   "Unclaimed property is an easy target for [state governments] when
they are under pressure" for revenue, said John Coalson, an Atlanta
attorney specializing in unclaimed property issues. "They see it as
low-hanging fruit because it doesn't involve raising taxes."</TE>
<TE>   About $15.6 billion is being held by 42 states that reported to
the National Assn. of Unclaimed Property Administrators. California
alone holds $2.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators of collection programs say they're better than the
alternative -- letting businesses use the cash to pad their profits.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to reunite the individual owners with their money, but if
that doesn't happen, at least it's back in the hands of the state
treasury to benefit the citizenry," Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that most of the money will never be claimed, some states
have dedicated unclaimed property revenue for special purposes. North
Carolina finances scholarships with the money; Virginia funds state
libraries.</TE>
<TE>   The money search has enriched independent contractors like New
York-based National Abandoned Property, which pockets a commission,
typically 12% of the assets it finds.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the biggest bundles of unclaimed property land
in big states like California, New York and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   But tiny Delaware, where many companies incorporate, gets a huge
chunk for a state whose population of about 800,000 ranks 45th in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Delaware took in $154 million in abandoned assets during its most
recent fiscal year and expects to collect another $115 million this
year. That's about $144 per resident. New York is counting on about
$21 per resident this year.</TE>
<TE>   Delaware is the last stop for unclaimed property from all over the
country because of rules that send the money to a company's state of
incorporation when the home address of the rightful owner is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300,000 companies are incorporated in Delaware,
including many of the nation's largest businesses.</TE>
<TE>   A 10-year agreement establishing the turf rights for unclaimed
property expires in March 2004, opening the door for Congress to
change the rules. And several of the most populous states want the
unclaimed property rights to be based on physical location of a
company's headquarters, which would result in a big financial hit for
Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   Delaware balances its desire for the revenue against the knowledge
that an overzealous push would threaten its business-friendly
reputation and prompt companies to incorporate elsewhere, said Bill
Remington, the state's director of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't act any differently in prosperous times or hard times,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other states are "really ratcheting up their [collection]
efforts," said Steve Wlodychak, who follows unclaimed property issues
for Ernst &amp; Young's western office.</TE>
<TE>   Some states are reducing the time before an unclaimed asset is
considered abandoned. Some offer amnesty programs to encourage
businesses to voluntarily turn over the assets and avoid state
penalties for holding on to the property for too long. In some
states, the penalties can reach as high as 25% of the asset's value.</TE>
<TE>   California decided to extend its amnesty program another year
after it helped increase unclaimed property revenue by 42%, to $461
million in the fiscal year that ended in June.</TE>
<TE>   The state expects the amnesty extension to help raise $393 million
in unclaimed property revenue during its current fiscal year while it
pays out $195.5 million to the rightful owners.</TE>
<TE>   State governments insist that their ultimate goal is to return the
money to the rightful owners. They place ads in local papers, set up
information booths in shopping malls and provide online search
engines.</TE>
<TE>   California credits the Internet for helping it do a better job of
returning abandoned assets. The state returned $191 million in
unclaimed property held in 204,621 accounts last year, up from $86
million held in 62,800 accounts in the fiscal year that ended in June
1996.</TE>
<TE>   National Abandoned Property has an Internet search engine for
property hunters at www.missingmoney.com, which is certified by the
National Assn. of Unclaimed Property Administrators, a government
group representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The
trade group also runs its own Web site, www.unclaimed.org, that
provides links to individual states' programs.</TE>
<TE>   After seeing a TV news segment about Missingmoney.com last year,
Melbourne, Fla., firefighter Jim Wilson entered his name into the
search engine and discovered $1,400 in annuities left behind by his
dead parents in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson received a check in less than six weeks -- money he used to
visit Colorado and re-establish a bond with his older brother.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like getting one final gift from my parents," Wilson said.</TE>

<HD>Storm Chaser Relishes Severe Weather</HD>
<DH>Meteorology: Enthusiast makes a career of pursuing
tornadoes and other phenomena since childhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARYN ROUSSEAU</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.</DL>
<LD>His car windshield is cracked. The tail lights are splintered. The
hood is cratered with hundreds of dings.</LD>
<LD>   "Every little possible thing on the car is damaged," Scott Blair
said proudly. "This car's been through hell and back."</LD>
<LD>   It's just one of the hazards that go with being a storm chaser.</LD>
<TE>   Blair, who is studying atmospheric sciences at the University of
Louisiana in Monroe, chases storms across his native Arkansas and the
Midwest during the spring and fall. He started watching the Weather
Channel at age 4 and began chasing at age 13 while riding in friends'
cars.</TE>
<TE>   Now 21, Blair is accustomed to the strange looks when he pulls up
at a stoplight and people see his battered car. Seven antennas jut
from the roof, and electronic devices pack the front seat.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think I chase UFOs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The gizmos put Blair in touch with truckers, other chasers and the
National Weather Service. Everything he needs for storm-chasing is
mounted within an arm's length of the driver's seat.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to be reaching for things when you're in a storm
on the road," said Blair, who claims that he has seen 22 tornadoes.</TE>
<TE>   He chases because severe weather fascinates and challenges him,
and the information he gathers can help people.</TE>
<TE>   "Chasing is a hobby, but through our hobby, we can help save
lives," he said. He regularly uses a cell phone -- also within reach
-- to send reports to local weather service offices.</TE>
<TE>   Each August, Blair invites storm enthusiasts from surrounding
states to his parents' Little Rock home to talk about the weather.</TE>
<TE>   Their cars -- dotted with dents and boasting broken windshields --
line his driveway. The two dozen chasers from Arkansas, Kansas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas share videos from the spring
chasing season and plan this fall's forays.</TE>
<TE>   A large yellow road sign in his driveway greets his chasing
friends. It reads "Tornado Zone."</TE>
<TE>   They share a cast-iron pot of homemade jambalaya, kept warm
beneath a makeshift lid: another road sign reading "Hurricane
Evacuation Route."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the living room, the chasers gawk at each other's
videos. Just like Blair, they easily remember the dates of major
storms. The comparisons fly across the room -- Jan. 21, March 1,
April 2 -- and are remembered like family birthdays or anniversaries.</TE>
<TE>   Blair said he plays host to these gatherings to bring the chasing
community together.</TE>
<TE>   "All chasers are friends," he said. "It's this real close
community. Everybody helps each other out."</TE>
<TE>   Videos from Tulsa storm chaser Jeff Piotrowski catch everyone's
attention. Even though the black-and-white picture is grainy and
shaky, you can hear the hail hitting the roof of Piotrowski's truck.</TE>
<TE>   "See it suck the trees right out of the ground," he tells the
group.</TE>
<TE>   They nod in understanding. They've all seen it before.</TE>
<TE>   Piotrowski and the other chasers rack up damage and miles on their
cars, although they don't bother repairing the dings and dents.</TE>
<TE>   "Chasing's not cheap," said Blair, who has 90,000 miles on his
1996 Ford Taurus. "You're talking the thousand-dollar range. But it's
something we love, something we do with a passion, so cost isn't a
consideration. I don't turn any insurance claims in. This would just
happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Blair's primary travel season stretches from April through May,
with shorter chases in late September and October. "We go out in
force, take our vacations, whatever we need to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   John Robinson, the severe warning coordinator for the weather
service at North Little Rock, said he doesn't advocate chasing, but
he appreciates the information.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't tell them to go out there," Robinson said. "Yes, we want
the reports, but we want them done safely."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson said Blair and his chasing colleagues work independently
of government storm chasers at the National Severe Storm Laboratory
in Norman, Okla. Those scientists chase severe weather for research
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Blair is happy to help save lives, saying there's only so much the
meteorologists can do at a desk.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, "I really can't live without chasing."</TE>

<HD>As Small Towns Fade, So Do Houses of Worship</HD>
<DH>Religion: Dwindling populations reduce congregations'
viability. Some of the churches date back to late 1800s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON COHEN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIRGINIA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>She first came to the red-brick temple in her father's arms, carried
past stained-glass windows, up to the stage for a special day. She
was 1 week old.</LD>
<LD>   Now she's 83.</LD>
<LD>   He came as a young, newly married doctor to this rugged Iron Range
mining town, joining his father in the crowded pews where they
attended services almost every Friday and Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Now he's 90.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Karon and John Siegel are the last active members of B'nai
Abraham synagogue, survivors of a once-thriving Jewish community,
mostly Eastern European immigrants and their descendants who prayed
and played poker, married and mourned under one roof for much of the
last century. They came when the walls rang with the Yiddish banter
of newcomers eager to learn English and find their place in a new
world.</TE>
<TE>   They stayed when the halls fell silent as people died or moved
away. The pews emptied, services stopped, the six Torahs --
handwritten scrolls of the first five books of the Old Testament --
were donated, stolen or sent elsewhere to be preserved. But the
synagogue still stands. And Karon and Siegel, as stubborn and proud
as the building itself, are determined that it be preserved.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we're alive, this building is going to stay alive,"
vowed Karon, who still drives to the synagogue in her 1992 Cadillac,
although she only lives at the other end of the block. "I feel
connected to this building."</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of [the] family," Siegel echoed. "I can't see letting
it go."</TE>
<TE>   The struggle to save religious sanctuaries -- along with their
history and heritage -- is a story that is repeating itself in small,
shrinking towns throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   "As rural America empties, so do the houses of worship," said
Marilyn Chiat, an art historian in Minnesota who specializes in
religious art and architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Many places date back to settlers who tilled the soil in the late
19th century and founded these now-fading communities. "They were
built by people who came to this country and couldn't make a
statement individually, but they could do it collectively," Chiat
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the town of Virginia, she says, building an elegant temple was
a public pronouncement -- an attitude not shared by some in big
cities who feared anti-Semitism and didn't want to attract attention.</TE>
<TE>   "They felt comfortable enough to be visible," Chiat said.</TE>
<TE>   B'nai Abraham is the only one of four synagogues remaining on the
Iron Range, a melting pot of European immigrants that once included
about 1,000 Jews, including the Zimmerman family and their son, Bob
Dylan, who grew up in nearby Hibbing.</TE>
<TE>   The 93-year-old temple, which is on the National Register of
Historic Places, has managed to defy the fate of other houses of
worship that have auctioned off their contents -- chairs, organs,
stained-glass windows -- then closed.</TE>
<TE>   Delafield Evangelical Lutheran Church, in western Minnesota, held
a final potluck dinner in 1998, then closed, ending its
125-year-history. Mark Brodin, who was baptized and confirmed there,
chronicled itis demise in a documentary. "Watching your past and your
family's past deteriorate -- that's a hard thing to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The white clapboard church was hauled away on a flatbed truck --
its steeple had been removed. It was born again as part of a
historical and tourist site 22 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   But many sit idle. In North Dakota, about 400 of 2,000 churches
are vacant, according to a study by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation. More than 75% are in towns of 2,500 or less.</TE>
<TE>   In the Dakotas, there once were more than 40 Disciples of Christ
churches; now there are two. In rural Iowa, 10 Methodist churches
have closed in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   In Rolling Fork and Greenwood, Miss., and Wharton, Texas,
synagogues have closed. In Lexington, Miss., and Helena, Ark., others
are in jeopardy. In southern New Jersey, a campaign is under way to
save nine temples, some dating to the 1880s.</TE>
<TE>   Some congregations hope to survive by bringing back a familiar
figure from America's past: the circuit-riding preacher who kept his
sermons in his saddle bags.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota, a retired minister has returned to the pulpit --
actually, three of them..</TE>
<TE>   A church or synagogue in a small town is for more than prayer,
says Gary Goreham, chairman of the department of sociology and
anthropology at North Dakota State University. "It's the glue that
holds much of a community together. It's a place that provides
meaning, identity and belonging."</TE>
<TE>   It was all that -- and more -- to Dorothy Karon and John Siegel.</TE>
<TE>   The story of B'nai Abraham mirrors the life of small-town America
at the turn of the 20th century: a flood of immigrants staking their
claim in a strange land.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia, about an hour north of Duluth, was a boom town, blessed
with iron ore mines and lumber. In the 1890s, there were 15 mines
among the towering curtains of evergreens and poplars. A decade
later, it was home to the world's biggest white-pine sawmill.</TE>
<TE>   Young men with strong backs and big dreams came from Norway,
Sweden, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Finland to claw out the ore
that helped transform America with railroads and cars.</TE>
<TE>   With mines and mills also came merchants, many of them Jewish,
setting up shop in town.</TE>
<TE>   There were the Milavetzes and the Shanedlings, whose names are
etched on the purple, blue and gold synagogue windows. And there were
the Schibels, Jewish brothers from Helsinki who owned a clothing
store catering to miners. Their advertisements, in Finnish, always
began with the words, "Fellow countrymen."</TE>
<TE>   The synagogue, built for $12,000, opened in 1909. Two of the
founders traveled to New York and Washington to solicit donations.
For most of its life, the temple was Orthodox -- and, in keeping with
tradition, women sat apart from men. It became a center for the
town's 175 to 200 Jews. "It was like a home away from home for
everybody," said Phyllis Gordon, Siegel's daughter, who lives in
Houston. "It's where all the gossip started -- right here."</TE>
<TE>   Demand for places at worship was so great that seats in the wooden
pews had to be numbered -- all 155 of them.</TE>
<TE>   But over time, the younger folks left. The small town that held
promise for one generation became a dead-end for the next.</TE>
<TE>   It has been decades since there was a regular rabbi and about a
dozen years since there were weekly services. Ten men, a minyan, are
needed for prayers. High Holy Day services ended about five years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Now the synagogue is empty, its walls adorned with plaques
commemorating the dead.</TE>
<TE>   When Karon's father carried her as an infant to the bema -- or
stage -- it was to receive her Hebrew name, Sprinsa Leah. "All the
things that parents hope their children will accomplish and become
were taught to me here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Karon, who never married, attended college in California, but
returned to run her father's oil business. She lives in her childhood
home, just down the block from the synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   She has almost 80 years of memories, from the joy of being a
little girl wearing a white beaded dress at a holiday party to the
sorrow of saying goodbye to her sister, Dolores, two years ago -- the
last funeral at the synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Siegel, a doctor for 44 years who delivered more than 3,000
babies, has his own recollections. Walking through a dusty basement
where Wednesday night poker games were once played, he remembers the
banquet held after the bar mitzvah for his son, Elliot, now 61.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a feeling of loneliness, I suppose," he said, looking
around the empty room.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, there have been a few offers to buy the synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the grandson of an original member expressed interest in
using it as a retreat for youths from Minneapolis-area synagogues.</TE>
<TE>   Saving this building, Chiat says, is too big a job for Karon and
Siegel, who have pitched in to pay for utilities and insurance. "What
these two people are doing is heroic, but they alone aren't going to
be able to preserve it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Benjamin Yokel, a doctor from a nearby town, traveled
to Virginia to conduct Friday night services and offer Hebrew lessons
for about 15 people. "The best way to honor the synagogue is to use
it as a synagogue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There were wine, food, a lesson, and children laughing and
running.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the crowd of years past but, Yokel says, the old place
had new life, even if only for a few hours. "If a building can be
happy," he said, "it was happy that night."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether you're a residential tenant or a landlord, you'll benefit
from reading the newest edition of "Renters' Rights."</LD>
<LD>   As with most Nolo Press law books, this well-researched and
easy-to-read book contains simple non-legalese explanations plus
state-by-state applicable statutes. Examples include maximum
security-deposit statutes, rent withholding laws for essential
repairs and statutory methods to prevent landlord retaliation.</LD>
<LD>   This realistic and practical book shows renters how to avoid being
pushed around by landlords, avoid unpleasant confrontations and
mediate to avoid going to court. There is also detailed information
on handling discrimination problems.</LD>
<TE>   The book's theme is understanding your legal rights as a renter so
you'll know what to do if your landlord treats you unfairly or
violates your state's landlord-tenant laws.</TE>
<TE>   But the book also emphasizes practical renter tactics, such as
impressing a prospective landlord with copies of your credit report,
references from previous landlords and other information to make you
look like an ideal tenant. The book also explains how to get all (or
at least most) of your security deposit refunded when moving out.</TE>
<TE>   Authors Janet Portman, who is an attorney, and Marcia Stewart
place major emphasis on the importance of a fair lease or
month-to-month rental agreement. They note that some disreputable
landlords include illegal or unenforceable clauses, such as one
absolving the landlord of any liability for negligence.</TE>
<TE>   The authors often first explain tenants' legal rights, then follow
with practical remedies to the potential problems involved.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it is illegal for a landlord to do a "self-help
eviction" for late rent payment by throwing the tenant's belongings
on the sidewalk. But the authors caution that a landlord who is
circumventing the law in that way isn't worth fighting. "Move on,"
they suggest.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you are a first-time renter or an experienced tenant, this
book is a reminder of the key points to discuss with your prospective
landlord or resident manager.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a "stand up for your rights and fight the landlord"
guide. With the possible exception of a below-market bargain
rent-control apartment, fighting with a difficult landlord isn't
worth the aggravation, Portman and Stewart advise.</TE>
<TE>   The chapter on roommates is especially enlightening. It explains
the legal responsibilities of roommates for paying the full rent if
one roommate can't or won't pay on time. The roommate chapter also
explains why landlords have no duty to refund part of the security
deposit when a roommate moves out. The authors even provide a
suggested checklist agreement for roommates to prevent problems.</TE>
<TE>   The authors explain how renters can sue their landlords, such as
for failure to promptly return a security deposit or for deducting
too much for cleaning or repairs.</TE>
<TE>   The appendix shows renters and landlords where to find their state
statutes on landlord-tenant rules, such as when rent is due, security
deposit laws and state fair housing agencies. This book can prevent
first-time tenants from making costly mistakes. And experienced
tenants will benefit from the practical advice for handling
potentially litigious situations with their landlords.</TE>

<HD>When Lenders Make Clients Jump Through Hoops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We were pre-approved for our home loan. We're making a down
payment of almost 50% cash and have excellent income and credit. But
about two weeks before the closing date, the lender indicated that it
doesn't believe we have saved so much for our down payment and claims
we must have borrowed the money. The lender insists on documentation
for all our fund transfers to consolidate our accounts to make the
down payment.</LD>
<LD>   We are asked to jump through financial hoops because our finances
are in excellent shape. The mortgage broker handling our application
is of little help. We have decided to pay cash for the house if the
lender doesn't make the loan. Do we have any recourse against the
mortgage broker or lender?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: If the lender gave you a written pre-approval mortgage
letter or certificate, without any condition for verifying your down
payment source, the lender is in breach of contract for requiring
more documentation.</LD>
<TE>   As a practical matter, you have no effective way to force the
lender to honor the written loan commitment pre-approval. Most such
pre-approvals are only contingent upon an appraisal of the house and
verification of employment. If you had the down-payment money in
various accounts, why not give the lender the requested information
and move on?</TE>
<TE>   However, if you can pay cash for the house, after taking title you
can then refinance with any lender you wish. Refinancing homeowners
are in a stronger borrowing position than home buyers because
homeowners are not under time pressure and can shop around to find
the best deal. Stay away from the mortgage broker who led you to the
unsatisfactory lender.</TE>
<TE>   Buy Vacation Homes With Money Not Needed</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are the expectations for second or vacation homes? Is this
a good or bad time to buy a vacation home?</TE>
<TE>   A: Second or vacation homes should be purchased only with
discretionary money that you won't need, just in case things don't go
well. Residences in vacation areas are subject to wild fluctuations
in market value, much greater than in developed urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   That's why most mortgage lenders charge higher interest rates, due
to higher risk, on vacation or second homes, compared to primary
residences.</TE>
<TE>   Better to Collect Mortgage Payments Than Rent</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have been renting my house for 14 years. I would like to buy
it from my landlord. It is dilapidated but in a wonderful area. Where
do I start?</TE>
<TE>   A: Presuming you have a good relationship with your landlord,
inform him or her you want to buy your residence. Don't even mention
the house's poor condition.</TE>
<TE>   As the former owner of rental houses that I sold to my tenants, I
know it is much more fun receiving monthly mortgage payments than
collecting rents and having to deal with tenants. Your landlord will
probably have a similar attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Have a friendly face-to-face meeting with your landlord. Explain
the benefits to him or her of helping finance your purchase (unless
you have a bundle of down-payment cash and can qualify for a new
mortgage) by carrying back a first or second mortgage. One of my
former rental houses broke even on the monthly cash flow. After my
tenant bought her home from me, by her taking over the existing first
mortgage and my agreeing to carry back a second mortgage, her monthly
payment stayed about the same. But I now receive over $450 net each
month with no worry about repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Second Mortgage Lender Can Also Foreclose</TE>
<TE>   Q: My friends purchased their home. They took over payments on the
existing first mortgage, and the sellers gave them a second mortgage
for the balance of the purchase price.</TE>
<TE>   All of the monthly payments to the mortgage company have been paid
on time. But my friends never made any payments on the second
mortgage to the sellers. The sellers foreclosed. Now the sellers'
attorney informed my friends they must vacate or be evicted. Is this
legal? What happens to the first mortgage on which the payments are
current?</TE>
<TE>   It was my understanding only a first mortgage lender can foreclose
and make you lose your home.</TE>
<TE>   A: You are mistaken. Either a first or second mortgage lender can
foreclose for nonpayment and cause the borrower to lose the home.</TE>
<TE>   After the second mortgage lender began foreclosure, your friends
had time to cure their default on the second mortgage. Apparently
they failed to do so.</TE>
<TE>   If the second mortgage lender acquired the house at the
foreclosure auction, that lender must now make payments to the first
mortgage lender or lose the house by foreclosure to that lender.
However, if a third-party bidder acquired the house at the
foreclosure auction, that new owner must make payments on the first
mortgage. For more details, consult a local real estate attorney.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-Year Mortgage Versus a 30-Year One</TE>
<TE>   Q: Should I refinance with a 15-year mortgage or a 30-year
mortgage? Obviously, the 15-year loan will save me substantial
interest. Which loan is better for income tax deductions?</TE>
<TE>   A: Don't let the income tax deduction control your decision.</TE>
<TE>   As I write this, the interest rate difference between 15-year and
30-year home loans is more than 1%. That is very high. Traditionally,
the difference was one-fourth to one-half percent interest.</TE>
<TE>   However, the big problem is the monthly payment on a 15-year
mortgage is about 20% larger than for a 30-year mortgage. If this is
higher than you can comfortably afford, my suggestion is to refinance
with a 30-year mortgage but pretend it is a 15-year mortgage and make
extra principal payments each month. If you find this increased
monthly payment is too high, you can then revert to the lower 30-year
payment rate.</TE>
<TE>   Pay Down Mortgage During Stock Slump?</TE>
<TE>   Q: With the stock market in the tank and going nowhere, I'm
thinking of selling a few loser stocks and investing the money in
paying down our home loan, which has a 6 7/8% interest rate. What do
you think of this idea?</TE>
<TE>   A: I am not a stock market advisor, so I can't suggest when to
sell your stocks. However, if you pay down your mortgage, you will be
making an investment at 6 7/8%. In today's financial markets, that
looks like a great investment.</TE>
<TE>   But I must add a word of caution. Please don't make a large lump
sum "investment" to pay down your mortgage if you will ever need that
money again. The reason is that you might not be able to reborrow it
if you are retired, unemployed, sick or unable to qualify for a
mortgage refinance or a home-equity loan.</TE>

<HD>'Churning' Ploy Is Resurfacing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW SICHELMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>California mortgage industry regulators have been warned to be on the
lookout for a long-defunct "churning" scheme in which unscrupulous
mortgage brokers generate thousands of dollars in extra fees by
convincing unwitting borrowers to refinance their loans every few
months.</LD>
<LD>   Though the lenders maintain no one is getting hurt, least of all
consumers, authorities say just the opposite is true. Not only do
borrowers who participate in the multiple refinance scheme fail to
build equity, said R.J. Harvey of the Illinois Office of Banks and
Real Estate, they also could lose their good credit standings. "Each
time they refinance, their credit scores drop," said Harvey, who
sounded the alarm at a conference here late last month. "Eventually,
they won't qualify and they'll be stuck with a higher [mortgage]
rate."</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps even worse, participants also could unwittingly be named
as co-conspirators in a plot that investors in mortgage-backed
securities say damages the integrity of their investments. Churning
was banned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development more
than a dozen years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "We expect the refinance transaction to be in the homeowner's best
interest" by resulting in an improvement in affordability, not as a
"vehicle for churning new mortgages," the government said in a 1990
memo to lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two largest investors in
mortgages, also prohibit the practice by refusing to take delivery of
any loan in which the broker has taken another application from the
same borrower for the same property or has entered into an agreement
to do so within a certain number of months. Fannie and Freddie are
two giant government-sponsored financial institutions chartered
solely to keep the money flowing for home loans. They do so by
purchasing loans from local lenders and packaging them into
securities that are prized by investors throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   Because Fannie and Freddie touch perhaps 60% of all home loans and
lenders like to have the option of being able to sell their loans at
any time, most mortgages are written to conform to
government-sponsored enterprises rules. And both companies say they
want no part of those that are repeatedly refinanced by the same
broker over short periods. Despite these prohibitions, several
lenders in Illinois seem to have revived the ploy, according to
Harvey, who is manager of supervision in the mortgage banking
division of the state banking and real estate office.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey stressed, however, that no charges have been filed because
it has yet to be determined whether churning is illegal in Illinois.
Harvey told regulators from other states that he also has alerted
HUD, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all of which are now in the process
of reviewing loan files to see if their rules have been broken.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme in question works like this: Brokers target borrowers
with high interest rates and promise to refinance loans to the
current market rate or sometimes lower. But rather than make the jump
down to the lowest rate in one fell swoop, lenders step the rate down
in five-or six-month increments over an extended period.</TE>
<TE>   Because the first refinancing is still above market, brokers can
obtain a premium price for the mortgage when it is placed with a
lender that actually funds the loan and then sells it on the
secondary mortgage market, where Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other
investors operate. After a few months, the loan is refinanced again
pursuant to a prearranged agreement with the borrower, but only to a
slightly lower rate so the broker can once again sell the mortgage
for a premium price. Then the process is repeated again and again
until the rate originally promised is reached.</TE>
<TE>   Each time the loan is refinanced, the broker establishes a
"temporary buy-down" by using all or part of the proceeds from the
loan to pay the closing costs and fees on behalf of the borrower.
Sometimes the broker pays the borrower's entire monthly payment
during the step-down period, which can run on for as long as five or
six months. In other instances, the borrower is required to make the
payment at the lower rate and the broker makes up the difference,
keeping the remainder as profit.</TE>
<TE>   But in almost all instances, the lender pockets thousands of
dollars in extra fees each time the loan in refinanced. "One young
guy [under investigation] is building a $1-million house with the
earnings" he generated by churning mortgages, Harvey said.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the offending brokers targeted borrowers with good
credit or those whose loan amounts exceeded the limits set by HUD and
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Currently, the Federal Housing
Administration can insure loans up to a maximum of $260,600, and
Fannie and Freddie can buy loans up to $300,700. Now, the
unscrupulous brokers' marks run the entire spectrum, and they
frequently sell the loan to different lenders each time it is
refinanced to avoid detection.</TE>
<TE>   To persuade borrowers to participate in their schemes, some
brokers claim that many major lenders are eager participants. They
assert that sharing a commission with a client is "a legal
alternative" that can save thousands in interest. The borrower also
is told the money need not be reported as income to the IRS. But that
may not be correct, Harvey said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, many borrowers are not told that to receive a new
interest credit, they must requalify each time the loan is
refinanced. Thus, if their credit situation takes a turn for the
worse, they may no longer be eligible and they would be stuck with
the higher rate. If a borrower decides to opt out of the scheme
before all stages are reached, he, too, would be throttled with a
higher-than-promised rate.</TE>

<HD>Undisclosed Defects Needn't Trap Smart, Informed Buyers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Have you ever bought a house with undisclosed defects?</LD>
<LD>   If the seller knew of the defects and failed to disclose them to
the buyer, the seller may be liable for damages. But the buyer's
legal difficulty is proving the seller knew about the defects and
failed to disclose.</LD>
<LD>   Suppose the home you buy was recently painted inside and outside
(as smart sellers often do). In addition to making the home look
attractive, that paint might be hiding serious defects, such as a
leaking roof, termite damage or dry rot.</LD>
<TE>   California was the first state to require house and condo sellers
to disclose in writing all known defects of the property. About 35
other states followed, but the types of disclosures vary state by
state. Long gone are the old days of "let the buyer beware."</TE>
<TE>   If in doubt, disclose. That should be the motto of every seller
and agent because if the buyer is told about a home's defect,
preferably in writing, that prevents the buyer from recovering
damages for nondisclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Last year I wrote about friends who wanted to buy a home in a
specific, top-quality school district. After they moved in, they
learned from neighbors that the house is not within the desired
school district. Instead, the house is two blocks outside the top
district, in an inferior district that is primarily on the other side
of a major freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The seller's listing agent had artfully concealed the bad school
district by disclosing only its number, not its name, on the multiple
listing. The buyer's agent didn't catch this major deception.</TE>
<TE>   The buyers could have sued for rescission of the sale, but they
liked the spacious house. So they contacted the top-quality school
district and obtained an inter-district transfer.</TE>
<TE>   However, their home is still within the inferior school district,
which will hurt resale value in the future. Potential buyers should
be aware that school districts don't necessarily follow city
boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Being within a poor-quality school district is known as an
"incurable defect." Other examples of incurable home defects include
a poor floor plan, an undesirable location, such as near a smelly
city dump, or being adjacent to a railroad track. However, sometimes
a home's incurable defect can be overcome by another advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Another couple bought a house with a horrible floor plan because
it was all they could afford within the best school district for
their two children. After a few years, they sold that house and
bought a better one within the same school district.</TE>
<TE>   However, they had no trouble selling the house with the bad floor
plan because its superb school district location outweighed the
defect.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers should include at least two key contingencies, in addition
to receiving a satisfactory seller's home disclosure report, if they
are to avoid buying a "bad house":</TE>
<TE>   * Finance contingency clause. Even if you are pre-approved in
writing by a lender for a home mortgage (as you should be before
shopping for a home), be sure to include in your purchase offer a
finance contingency clause. Then, if your house doesn't appraise for
at least the sales price by the lender who gave you pre-approval, you
can cancel the purchase and get your deposit refunded.</TE>
<TE>   * Professional inspection clause. Make your home purchase offer
contingent on a satisfactory professional inspection. Look for local
members of the American Society of Home Inspectors, or ASHI, at (800)
743-2744 or on the Internet at www.ashi.com.</TE>
<TE>   Incidentally, be sure to accompany the professional inspector to
discuss any defects not previously disclosed. Don't hesitate to ask
questions. Most inspectors enjoy answering questions and explaining
how to resolve problems discovered.</TE>
<TE>   After moving into your home, if you discover a serious defect, ask
the neighbors if they knew of the problem. If they knew, chances are
your sellers knew and can be held liable for damages due to their
faulty disclosure statement.</TE>
<TE>   Some sellers erroneously think they can avoid disclosing residence
defects by selling the home "as is." An "as is" sale just means the
seller doesn't have to pay for any repairs. However, even "as is"
sellers must still disclose to their buyers any known defects in the
residence.</TE>

<LD>Most Americans rate homeownership as the best investment they can
make--far ahead of the 401(k), retirement accounts and stocks,
according to an annual survey of homeownership attitudes conducted by
Fannie Mae.</LD>
<LD>   Economists and demographers have said that baby boomers,
minorities and immigrants will be important forces in the housing
market.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-one percent of baby boomers said they were very or fairly
likely to buy a home in the next three years, as did 42% of African
Americans, 37% of Latinos and 34% of Latino immigrants.</LD>
<TE>   Among the two in five respondents who said they follow the housing

<HD>Select Interior Doors That Reflect Home's Basic Style</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your basic door. It's a simple enough thing, yet it packs such a
visual wallop that architects and homeowners alike can spend hours or
even days looking for just the right choice.</LD>
<LD>   What size? What style? And should it swing or slide?</LD>
<LD>   Setting aside the front door, which is a subject in itself, here
are some guidelines for picking the right kind of interior door from
the huge array available.</LD>
<TE>   Hinged doors are, of course, the most common. In these
froufrou-crazy times, flush doors--the plain, smooth kind--long ago
lost out to recessed-panel designs molded out of hardboard. Of these,
the common six-panel style is generally the best choice for
neotraditional homes built during the past two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Other panel designs having Italianate arches, Colonial-style split
pediments or narrow Victorian panels are best restricted to newer
homes corresponding to those styles.</TE>
<TE>   However, molded doors are not a good choice for prewar traditional
homes, which should have genuine wood doors. Nor are they appropriate
to postwar ranches or other Modernist-era homes, which should have
flush doors.</TE>
<TE>   If you're simply dying to get rid of those cardboardy hollow-core
doors in your postwar home, consider replacing them with good-quality
solid-core flush doors rather than molded neotraditional ones.</TE>
<TE>   As for size, the doors to major rooms are usually 32 inches wide,
while 28-inch doors are customary in secondary rooms such as baths.
You can buy doors as narrow as 18 inches, but they're meant for
closets, not room entrances.</TE>
<TE>   Double doors, for all their elegance, don't really provide a wider
passage in everyday use, since one leaf is usually latched in place.
Choose double-door widths with that in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Glazed doors--better known as French doors--provide one of the
easiest ways to distinguish an interior. They're available with any
number of panes ("lites," in trade lingo), from a single large one to
10, 15 or more.</TE>
<TE>   Glazed doors will fit with both traditional and modern designs as
long as you choose the right kind of "sticking"--the strips of wood
that hold in the glass. For traditional homes the sticking can be
molded, but for modern styles it should be rectangular, or the door
will look too ornate.</TE>
<TE>   In accordance with current fashion, most of the doors at your
local home improvement center will have molded sticking, so you may
have to special-order the plain kind.</TE>
<TE>   Glazing provides another outlet for creativity. Clear glass is
usually standard, but patterned, etched and colored glass are also
available. Frosted glass doors can be used for bedrooms and even
bathrooms to let light into dark hallways.</TE>
<TE>   In restricted areas, or where doors will be left open most of the
time--say, between a kitchen and dining room--a pocket door (often
mistakenly called a sliding door) is the solution. Since it retracts
into the wall and virtually disappears, it won't clutter up the room
like a hinged door will.</TE>
<TE>   Strictly speaking, the only thing that distinguishes a pocket door
from a hinged door is the hardware, so any of the designs available
for hinged doors will also work as pocket doors, including glazed
ones. Naturally, there has to be a solid wall on one side for the
door to retract into, and there can't be any kind of sticking or
ornament protruding beyond the door surface. Make sure you get good,
smooth-running hardware too, because once installed, a balky door is
no fun to repair.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Files Briefs to Halt Markup of Closing Fees</HD>

<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--In an unusual series of legal moves, the Bush
administration has quietly intervened recently in private lawsuits in
an effort to establish a single, critical point of consumer law:
Mortgage lenders, title agencies and other companies are not allowed
to mark up the costs of any services that are part of a home real
estate settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Like firefighters scrambling to fight new flare-ups, teams of
lawyers from the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing
and Urban Development have filed friend of the court briefs in
class-action suits pending in three far-flung federal appellate
courts. In each case, homeowners have alleged that they were charged
"unearned" and "marked up" fees at their mortgage settlements.</LD>
<LD>   Normally the federal government pays little attention to private
suits in which the government is not a party.</LD>
<TE>   But the three rapid-fire interventions in markup cases in recent
weeks are special: Though federal housing officials are adamant that
their longtime policy banning all markups is correct, the
government's position has been rejected by two successive federal
appellate courts.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of those rejections, home mortgage borrowers in eight
states have no legal protections against marked-up settlement
fees--no matter how high or blatant the excess fees may be. The
courts' decisions affect home buyers and refinancers in Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia and the Carolinas (the federal judicial 4th
Circuit) and in Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana (the 7th Circuit).</TE>
<TE>   In practical terms, a lender or settlement agent in those states
can legally charge mortgage clients $450 for an appraisal that cost
the lender $20 or less in electronic form, or can charge $65 for a
credit report that costs just $12. Similar discrepancies exist for
most other settlement-sheet line items.</TE>
<TE>   HUD has prohibited markups nationwide for more than a decade. But
in a decision last year involving markups of title fees for Chicago
home buyers, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that HUD's
ban was not sufficiently supported by the language of the federal
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, a consumer protection law for
home buyers enacted in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   HUD Secretary Mel R. Martinez, a lawyer and recent home buyer
himself, disagreed sharply with the appellate court's interpretation
last October and announced an intensified crackdown on markups for
2002. Currently the agency has "over 100" investigations under way
against alleged settlement fee markup schemes, according to federal
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the strong policy statement from the HUD secretary, a
second appellate court rejected the agency's ban on markups last May.
In that case, a Maryland homeowner was charged $65 for a credit
report she alleged cost the lender, Crossland Mortgage Corp., $15 or
less.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with two straight defeats, lawyers at HUD and the Justice
Department decided to intervene in markup cases in other judicial
circuits around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Part of their intent is to defeat their mortgage and title
industry opponents in at least one appellate court, thereby clearing
the way for a final resolution of the dispute by the U.S. Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   The high court virtually always reviews issues where appellate
courts have disagreed among themselves--leaving the application of
federal law starkly different for citizens who live in different
jurisdictions.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 3, Justice Department and HUD lawyers intervened as a
friend of the court in a case in the Midwest (8th Circuit) involving
alleged credit report and appraisal fee markups by the Bank of
America.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, a lower court had earlier supported the government's
position that HUD's policy statement on the settlement law should be
given deference by federal courts.</TE>
<TE>   Justice and HUD also intervened recently in a Florida suit (11th
Circuit) where home buyers alleged that Chase Manhattan Mortgage
Corp. illegally overcharged them on courier fees at settlements; and
in a Chicago case (7th Circuit) involving alleged markups by a title
agency. In the latter case the government is asking the appellate
court to reconsider its now-controversial decision of 2001 that
opened the floodgates to unlimited markups at real estate closings.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot for consumers? The federal government says markups are
illegal in all states except the eight mentioned above.</TE>
<TE>   However, many lenders, title agencies and settlement firms
continue to lard markups onto settlement sheets around the country,
according to federal investigators--convinced that no federal court,
or Congress, will tell them the practice violates federal law.</TE>

<LD>This Pacific Palisades home, originally built in 1980 on an
acre-plus-sized promontory, was recently rebuilt by Gordon Gibson.</LD>
<LD>   The Italian Mediterranean estate, in a gated community, was
redecorated by Cissie Cooper, with the advice of masters from three
schools of feng shui, the ancient Chinese practice of arranging rooms
in ways that create harmony and balance.</LD>
<LD>   As reported in the book "Feng Shui at Home" by Carol Soucek King,
Cooper approached the owner with the idea of using feng shui in the
renovation, but he rolled his eyes and told her to forget it. Two
days later, he changed his mind after seeing New York real estate
mogul Donald Trump rave about feng shui on CNN.</LD>
<TE>   The owners took the advice of Cooper and the feng shui masters
when selecting furnishings and antiques, which may remain in the home
for an additional cost.</TE>
<TE>   About this home: With Tuscan-like countryside views, the house is
reached by way of a private drive. The property is sprinkled with
gardens and pergolas.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $5.9 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The 6,000-plus-square-foot house has five bedrooms and 6 1/2
bathrooms. The property is 46,082 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The house has a dining room, breakfast area, family
room, library/study, living room, private pool and north-south tennis
court. The home also has canyon and greenbelt views.</TE>
<TE>   Where: Pacific Palisades</TE>

<LD>Jason Bateman, who appears in the upcoming NBC comedy series "It's
Not About Me," and his actress wife, Amanda Anka, have purchased
their first home since their marriage last year. The couple sold the
house where Anka had lived before their wedding.</LD>
<LD>   "It was our plan for me to sell my house in Santa Monica and
Amanda to sell her house in Hollywood, and we would get a house
together," said Bateman, who sold his bachelor pad several months
ago. "We finally found a house we both liked." It closed escrow last
week. Anka's home sold a few days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The house they bought for close to its $900,000 asking price has
four bedrooms and 2 3/4 bathrooms in nearly 3,000 square feet. It is
a mid-century post-and-beam house in the Hollywood Hills with walls
of glass, and it is surrounded by a bamboo forest. The two-story
house also has a private guest wing with a separate entrance and
parking for six cars.</LD>
<TE>   Anka's former home sold for close to its $625,000 asking price.
The Spanish-style, one-story house has three bedrooms and two
bathrooms in slightly more than 2,000 square feet. Built in 1925, it
has high ceilings, a fireplace, original tile, French doors, a
laundry room and parking for four cars.</TE>
<TE>   Bateman and Anka plan to do a little remodeling before moving into
their new home, which "might be ready by Thanksgiving or even
Halloween," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Amanda is up to her ears in getting everything organized, and I
am trying to help as much as possible. I wrap a glass when she tells
me, I pack a box when I'm told. We're best when she's steering the
boat."</TE>
<TE>   Bateman, 33, appeared in the movie "The Sweetest Thing," starring
Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate, and was a regular last year in
the TV series "Some of My Best Friends." He has worked in TV since
the early '80s and played Bob Newhart's son on "George &amp; Leo"
(1997-98) and the eldest son on "The Hogan Family" (1986-91).</TE>
<TE>   Anka, daughter of pop singer Paul Anka, has appeared in such
series as "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "Beverly Hills 90210" and
"Diagnosis Murder." She also worked on the movie "Undercover
Brother," which was released in May.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Ehrlich of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills,
represented the couple in buying and selling. Tom O'Rourke of
Prudential John Aaroe, Pacific Design Center, had the listing on the
home they bought.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura beach house owned by the family of actor Richard
Dreyfuss, who in August was filming a movie called "Coast to Coast"
with Judy Davis in Toronto, has been sold. Details of the sale were
not disclosed, but real estate sources say that the house sold for
close to its $1.4-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The house was designed and built in 1982 by the actor's
writer-producer brother, Lorin. "We had wonderful family gatherings
there for 20 years," he said. "It was our mother's favorite spot, and
it will be hard to replace emotionally."</TE>
<TE>   The death of Geraldine Dreyfuss, who died in October 2000,
prompted the family to sell the house.</TE>
<TE>   The Mediterranean-style home, on Pierpont Beach, has six bedrooms
and four bathrooms in about 3,500 square feet. It also has two
fireplaces and 500 square feet of decks and patios.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for a place in the Ventura area to replace the
family beach house, but even little ocean-view condos were a
fortune," Lorin Dreyfuss said. "So I bought a 53-foot yacht." After
all, he said, you "can't get any closer to the ocean than in it."</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine Dreyfuss played the mother of Richard Dreyfuss'
character in "Down and Out in Beverly Hills" (1986). Among his
writing projects, Lorin Dreyfuss co-wrote at least one episode of the
recently canceled TV series "The Education of Max Bickford," which
stars his brother.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Dreyfuss, 54, will make a stage appearance in the upcoming
off-Broadway season when he stars with Kyra Sedgwick in the drama
"The Exonerated."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Winnick, chairman of the Bermuda-based Global Crossing
telecommunications company, has sold a Malibu home for about its
$9.8-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The buyer was Alec E. Gores, an L.A. buyout specialist whose firm
submitted a joint bid for Global Crossing before two Asian companies
struck a pending deal to pull the company out of bankruptcy. The
Asian firms are offering to buy a majority share of the company for
$250 million. Global Crossing was once valued at more than $50
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick purchased the Malibu home in March of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Originally built in 1931, the remodeled Cape Cod-style home is on
slightly more than half an acre and has landscaped lawns and ocean
views.</TE>
<TE>   The main house has a master suite upstairs on the water, a large
kitchen, two other bedroom suites, a living room, a dining room and
an attached teahouse on the sand. The property also has a two-bedroom
guest apartment and a gym.</TE>
<TE>   A Napa Valley home and vineyard owned by the estate of the late
Joseph Judson ("J.J.") Cohn, one of the five founders of MGM studios
and an original member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, has come on the market at $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   Cohn died at age 100 in 1996 in his Beverly Hills home. He was a
major player in the film industry but preferred anonymity, rarely
giving interviews.</TE>
<TE>   His former Napa Valley home is on more than 200 acres and includes
a house built in the 1860s by Serranus Clinton Hastings, California's
first chief justice and founder of UC Berkeley's Hastings College of
the Law.</TE>
<TE>   The house has seven bedrooms and 3 1/2 bathrooms in about 7,000
square feet. More than 80 acres of the estate are planted with grapes
used to make Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.</TE>
<TE>   The property also has three barns, a caretaker's house, two wells,
a reservoir, mountain springs and another detached house and barn.</TE>
<TE>   The estate is in the Rutherford Bench Appellation.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford Rowe and Andrea Tzadik of Prudential John Aaroe,
Brentwood, have the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Arcona, holistic beauty therapist to stars such as Sharon Stone
and Anjelica Huston, has listed her Toluca Lake penthouse at just
under $1.1 million. Arcona, who goes by her first name only, is
selling the unit because she plans to buy a nearby ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Her 4,000-square-foot penthouse has three bedrooms, including a
master retreat with a fireplace, spa tub, shower and bidet. The unit
also has a 1,200-square-foot patio with views of the Hollywood Hills
and San Gabriel Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Arcona, who has owned the penthouse since it was built in 1991,
saw to it that toxin-free paint, hardwood floors and tile were used
in the unit in an effort to reduce allergens. She also consulted a
feng shui specialist when furnishing the Southwestern-style unit.</TE>
<TE>   Arcona studied premed and worked as a medical technician in Munich
before moving to L.A. in the early '70s. She began giving holistic
facials out of her house in 1986 and developed the Arcona Skin and

<HD>Can Error by Lender Result in Foreclosure?</HD>

<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since 1997, Paul made on-time monthly payments on his home loan to
mortgage lender Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp. But in August 2000 he
stopped making payments after he received a letter from Chase
acknowledging his mortgage payoff.</LD>
<LD>   Through a Chase customer service representative, Paul notified
Chase of its error. However, on Aug. 15, 2000, Paul received a check
from Chase for an escrow refund. On Oct. 12, 2000, Chase recorded a
satisfaction of mortgage.</LD>
<LD>   But on Nov. 14, 2000, Chase sent Paul a "loan reactivation" letter
with a new loan number on which to make payments. During this time,
Paul placed his regular monthly payments into a bank account, which
he later transferred to his attorney's trust account.</LD>
<TE>   As a result of Paul's failure to resume payments to Chase, Chase
notified the credit bureaus about Paul's default status and began
foreclosure. In April 2001, Chase's attorney advised Paul to resume
payments to Chase. Chase recorded a Vacatur, Revocation and
Cancellation of Satisfaction of Mortgage. When Paul asked for a copy
of the original promissory note, Chase was unable to find it.</TE>
<TE>   Paul sued Chase for violation of the federal Fair Debt Collections
Practices Act, slander of credit and declaratory relief. Chase filed
a counterclaim for foreclosure and reestablishment of the lost
promissory note.</TE>
<TE>   If you were the judge, would you reinstate the mortgage or allow
Chase to proceed with foreclosure for nonpayment? The judge began by
explaining Chase does not have a right to foreclose on Paul's home
because Chase erroneously recorded its mortgage satisfaction,
followed by recording of the Vacatur, Revocation and Cancellation of
Satisfaction of Mortgage. Such action was improper without court
approval, the judge noted. However, Paul is not blameless, the judge
continued, because he should have paid the disputed payments to the
court (rather than to his attorney's trust account). Paul claims he
attempted to make the payments to Chase but was refused because there
was no mortgage loan number upon which to apply the payments, the
judge noted.</TE>
<TE>   Equity requires a balancing between Chase's right to a security
interest in Paul's home and Paul's attempts to make timely payments,
the judge explained. Therefore, Chase's request to foreclose is
denied, the judge ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence shows Chase held a promissory note signed by Paul in
1997, which Chase has lost, the judge continued. The court will
reestablish Chase's note and the recorded mortgage through a Vacatur,
Revocation and Cancellation of Satisfaction of Mortgage, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Paul is ordered to tender all previously escrowed mortgage
payments to the court within 10 days and shall henceforth resume
monthly payments to Chase under the reestablished promissory note and
mortgage, the judge concluded.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW SICHELMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--In a misguided attempt to improve their credit scores,
too many mortgage borrowers are taking steps that end up doing more
harm than good.</LD>
<LD>   Among other blunders, they are paying off judgments when they
don't have to, closing out old accounts they shouldn't, opening up
new ones and unnecessarily consolidating their credit cards. While
all of these strategies seem like sound ways to upgrade your
borrowing position, any one of them is more likely to have a negative
impact on your score.</LD>
<LD>   So will surfing online for the very best rates available, trying
to improve on a score that's already good enough to obtain the rate
you are after and opening up new accounts after you've been approved
for the mortgage.</LD>
<TE>   In all of these cases, said Ginny Ferguson, a mortgage broker in
Pleasanton, Calif., timing is everything. Why? Because a credit score
is simply a snapshot of your credit profile on the day it is
calculated. Three days from then, it could be totally different.</TE>
<TE>   Much of what Ferguson, chairwoman of the National Assn. of
Mortgage Brokers' credit-scoring task force, has to say is contrary
to popular wisdom. But she said that in many instances, "consumers
are being given bad information that can be extremely detrimental to
their credit scores."</TE>
<TE>   For the uninitiated, a credit score is a numerical,
computer-generated statistical grade that quickly and objectively
evaluates the information in your credit profile. It is often
referred to as a FICO score, after the company that originated it,
Fair Isaacs &amp; Co. But only one of the three major credit repositories
actually uses the FICO model; the other two have their own software
programs. Mortgage companies and secondary market investors have been
using scoring for years now because it increases their ability to
determine their risk on each loan. They use the predictive power of
scoring to weed out the slow or bad payers and decide who pays less,
who pays more and who doesn't qualify at any rate.</TE>
<TE>   A loan applicant's score isn't the only determining factor. Such
considerations as income, how long he or she has been on the job,
location of the property, down payment and cash on hand are important
too. But it is a key piece of the puzzle, so it behooves anyone who
is in the market for a house to go over their credit files carefully
at least 90 days before applying for a loan.</TE>
<TE>   Applicants should take steps necessary to correct mistakes and
expunge incorrect information. Pay off any and all current late
accounts right away. "Right now, past dues are killers," said
Ferguson, a former real estate broker. "They will submarine you, so
paying them off will have an immediate and positive impact" on your
score.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, though, proceed cautiously. You don't want to pay off
any judgments or collections that are at least 24 months old. Not
only is this "unlikely to get you where you want to go," Ferguson
warned, it could turn an old problem the scoring software views as
insignificant into a new one the program sees as much more serious.
Why? Because scores are based on the last day of activity. So if you
pay off a 5-year-old credit problem, it automatically becomes a
"yesterday event" that will have a much more profound (read negative)
impact on your score.</TE>
<TE>   If the lender requires you to pay off old "derogatories," as they
are called, Ferguson suggested doing so at closing, not before.
Otherwise you take the chance the payoff could be counted against
you. Even if you act after you've been approved, it could have a
negative impact because, for quality-control reasons, some lenders
run a new credit report a few days before settlement. If that
happens, the new entry could lower your score. That's the same reason
you don't want to open any new credit accounts before closing. Even
if they have a zero balance, new accounts will drop your score. How
much depends on what else is in your profile and how the 40 different
variables the software looks at stack up against one another. But
even a few points can impact the price of the loan or the type of
loan for which you qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Be careful about consolidating debt and closing credit cards.
Missteps here could give the system the wrong impression about how
you use credit. "Don't consolidate," Ferguson said. "It could send
your score into the basement." The reason: The number of sizable
outstanding balances is predictive of risk, as is the proportion of
those balances to the total credit limit.</TE>
<TE>   It is better to have five credit cards, each with $5,000 limits
and four with $1,000 balances, than to consolidate all that into a
single card with a $5,000 limit and a $4,000 balance. When you are
only using 16% of your available credit, the system sees you as
self-disciplined and low-risk. But when you are using 80% of your
available credit, you've changed the picture entirely. "From a risk
perspective, who would you loan to?" Ferguson asked. "You'll get far
more mileage out of paying your available balances down to 30% or
less of the credit available to you than you will by paying off some
cards and leaving others maxed out."</TE>
<TE>   The length of time you've had credit can be critical too. A short
history is indicative of risk, especially if other negative factors
exist. If you transfer the balances from accounts you have had for
three, four or five years into a brand new account, even one carrying
a lower interest rate, you no longer have any longer-term credit to
evaluate.</TE>
<TE>   Scoring models "don't like limited credit histories," said the
scoring expert. "The longer you've had credit, the more time there is
to analyze. If you've had credit for only a few months, the system
won't know how you are going to perform. Therefore, a seasoned file
is going to score higher."</TE>
<TE>   Models aren't crazy about lots of credit inquiries, either.
Multiple inquiries contribute less than 10% of the weight of a score,
depending on what else is in your file. Ordinarily, inquiries alone
will not lower a score dramatically. But timing is key. Multiple
requests by auto dealers or mortgage companies made within a 14-day
period count as one inquiry. But quality-control inquiries and all
others older than 30 days before the date on the current report will
have an effect.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why you should be "very cautious" of surfing the Internet
for a loan, Ferguson said. "You can look all day long. But the minute
you authorize an online lender to pull your credit report, you are
creating an inquiry" that could count against your score, she said.
Finally, if your score is high enough to obtain the rate and terms
you are after, leave well enough alone. "If it's not broken, don't
fix it," Ferguson said. "Even if you think your score should have
been higher, don't try to fix it in the middle of the lending
process. Wait until after the fact; otherwise, chances are good your
score will go down, not up."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After engaging an architect to design a house, most couples begin the
first meeting with a discussion of their functional requirements: "I
want a big kitchen." Or specific rooms: "Let's talk about the foyer."
Or lifestyle: "We entertain a lot."</LD>
<LD>   But to get a house that really fits your needs, Memphis architect
Carson Looney said, you have to discuss personal habits. Are you
fastidious? Generally neat or frankly messy?</LD>
<LD>   In 25 years of designing houses, Looney has found that almost
every couple has one of each. And as the clutter starts to overtake
the house and tax the relationship, the clients think a bigger house
will solve the problem.</LD>
<TE>   But "bigger isn't better, better organized is better," Looney
said. "The solution is to find a place for all that junk. 'Everything
in its place' ... only works if you have a place for everything and
it's so easy to use you can't avoid using it."</TE>
<TE>   The three places in a house where neat and messy most often
collide are the kitchen, the bathroom and the entry area.</TE>
<TE>   Junk mail and catalogs overflow the mail table and often end up on
the rarely used dining table. Every kid in America carries a
backpack, and these invariably pile up near the front door along with
coats and sports equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Looney's unusual solution to this front hall disaster is what he
calls a "liver room." As the liver is the cleansing organ of the
body, the liver room is the cleansing place of the house though which
all household members must pass before entering the living areas.</TE>
<TE>   Intended to capture coats, backpacks, sports equipment, mail,
brief cases, laptops and everything else, the room usually has a
bench with space for shoes, and hooks abound. There's plenty of
shelving and each family member has a designated cubby. If space and
budget permit, Looney incorporates a small home office where the mail
is sorted out, bills are paid and household files are kept.</TE>
<TE>   Once Looney's clients understand the concept, he said they are
universally enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen can turn into a neat-messy war zone and being bigger
can make things worse. In her 20 years of designing houses, Los
Angeles architect Gina Moffitt has found that when a kitchen is
large, functions and storage tend to be spread out.</TE>
<TE>   This makes for lots of walking back and forth to get all the items
required, even for something as simple as making toast (open the
bread box, get out the toaster, fix the toast, get a plate and butter
and jam).</TE>
<TE>   Rather than retrace all those steps to put everything away, the
messy person will leave things out on the counter. To avoid this,
Moffet organizes the kitchen layout so that the storage related to a
task is next to the equipment that will be used for it. Not only is
the task easier, both partners are more likely to clean up afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Many clients already use an appliance garage to contain some of
the kitchen clutter. Moffitt also puts one in the master bathroom "to
make bottles and potions disappear."</TE>
<TE>   Looney has had great success in capturing bathroom clutter in a
built-in recessed shelf with sliding doors that he puts just above
the sink.</TE>
<TE>   "It eats up about eight inches of mirror, but it works," Looney
said. "You put outlets in it as well, so you can use an electric
shaver and put it right back."</TE>
<TE>   Separate his and hers vanities can help, and both architects
recommend an outlet in the top drawer of the vanity for a hair dryer
so that owners just open the drawer, use it, stick it back and shut
the drawer. Moffitt also includes a large niche in the shower and the
tub for hair-care products.</TE>
<TE>   Also problematic can be the dressing area in the master bedroom.
It's easier to control when it's separated from the sleeping area,
which both architects like to keep small because a smaller bedroom
means fewer places for clutter to accumulate.</TE>
<TE>   If the budget and house are big enough, separate dressing areas
are optimal. At the very least, each partner should have his own
closet and dresser storage. Not only will a separate dressing area
eliminate a trail of clothes across the bedroom floor, by moving the
dressers in as well, the contents of pockets won't appear all over
the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Moffitt recommends a good-sized built-in clothes hamper with a
large drawer or pullout. The advantage of this over a free-standing
type is that clothes cannot pile up on top of it.</TE>
<TE>   Even with these tactics, the dressing area won't be perfect, and
you'll still want to shut the door to hide the mess, Looney said. He
always specifies a pocket door because "you only have to move a few
clothes out of the way to close it."</TE>
<TE>   If there's any money left in the budget, Looney also suggests a
way to make that rarely used dining room serve double duty as a hobby
area.</TE>
<TE>   He advises owners to get a heavy-duty oilcloth to protect the
table and he specifies cabinets with formal-looking raised panel
doors to hold hobby equipment and materials. With the storage area
right there, cleaning up for company is easy and quick.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have to walk through two or three rooms to get stuff, you
won't put it away," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both architects said that clients are happily surprised to
discover that design can help bring order to a cluttered household.</TE>
<TE>   Looney said clients are even more surprised to find that the
details that will bring the clutter under control and make a house
more livable are "not real noticeable. You won't notice the little
shelf above the vanity unit until it's pointed out."</TE>

couple who value its vintage</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirty-three years ago--when Luis Gonzalez was born and Heide Jenkins
was a schoolgirl--the house they would one day buy and renovate had
already been vacant for several years.</LD>
<LD>   Surrounded by chain-link fencing, overgrown by shrubs and said by
neighborhood kids to be haunted, the modest 1927 bungalow remained
vacant through the '70s, '80s and '90s, until the couple tracked down
the owner and persuaded him to sell.</LD>
<LD>   "This house was meant to be," Gonzalez said of the two-bedroom,
one-bathroom house the couple bought in 2000 for $150,000.</LD>
<TE>   Jenkins, a teacher in South-Central L.A., and Gonzalez, who works
in the clothing industry, had been looking for a fixer-upper a few
years ago after outgrowing their tiny Venice cottage, minuscule lot
and noisy neighborhood. That house had been fixed up by Gonzalez's
Uncle Fernie, contractor Fernando Linares.</TE>
<TE>   The couple wanted to live in Silver Lake, Echo Park or Mt.
Washington, but they found prices too high and gave up the search.
While going to visit Linares in the unincorporated Del Rey community
near Culver City one day, they noticed a deserted house down the
street.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd seen it so many times before," Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   "And it never clicked," Jenkins added.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins' mother, real estate agent Margret Jenkins, looked up the
name of the house's owner. No phone number was listed, but she
offered to write to the Northern California address on the title.</TE>
<TE>   When no response came, she wrote again. Finally owner Philip
Padley called.</TE>
<TE>   The house had been left to Padley by his aunt, Violet Keller, who
had lived there for 40 years and whose husband built it in 1927 when
nearby Jefferson Boulevard was a dirt road. As a youngster, Padley
lived five houses away from his aunt, in the house now owned by
Linares.</TE>
<TE>   Padley made arrangements to visit and brought an album of photos.
One showed his aunt in front of the trim white stucco house with an
arched window, a wood gate leading to a small entry courtyard and
wood French doors.</TE>
<TE>   By Keller's later years in the house, however, the wood windows
had been replaced with aluminum ones, and the French doors with
aluminum sliders. Black iron bars covered every window, and black
iron mesh enveloped the courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   Padley wouldn't say why he had never sold the house, but a
neighbor told Gonzalez and Jenkins that others had offered to buy it
over the years. In the 1980s someone forged documents to take the
title, and Padley went to court to get it back.</TE>
<TE>   When Jenkins and Gonzalez saw the inside of the house, they were
stunned, Jenkins recalled, both for its underlying '20s flair--wood
floors, tiled kitchen, tiled bathtub cove, arches, coved ceilings,
nooks and built-in bookcases--and for the damage the years had
wrought.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to describe how bad it was," Gonzalez said. Where the
tile roof had leaked or fallen in, the plaster walls had turned to
mush and floors had rotted. Fist-sized mold spots covered some walls.
Old linoleum curled from the floors. And the house was gloomy behind
the bars and aluminum awnings.</TE>
<TE>   The couple wanted it nevertheless. "What we saw underneath all
this," Jenkins said, "was all the things that we were looking for."</TE>
<TE>   It took months for the couple to convince Padley that he should
sell to them. Finally, early in 2000, he agreed and set a price
calculated for the land value only, as the house was considered a
teardown.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than raze it, Jenkins and Gonzalez had one overriding goal:
to bring it back to the way it was when Keller first lived there.</TE>
<TE>   Their primary objective was aesthetic--install new wood windows
and French doors. Vinyl and aluminum windows, Gonzalez said, "are not
our cup of tea."</TE>
<TE>   Other goals were fixing the rotten walls and ceilings, salvaging
the wood floors where possible and protecting the antique tile during
the construction phase. To make the house lighter, they removed the
bars and awnings, and Linares suggested adding four skylights.</TE>
<TE>   Linares also recommended taking space from one of the two bedrooms
for a second bathroom and then extending that bedroom into the
backyard. He suggested cutting an arch in the wall between the dining
room and the kitchen to make the small kitchen seem larger.</TE>
<TE>   To keep within a budget of about $75,000 for the major work, the
couple made some concessions. An arched picture window would be
inordinately expensive, so they settled on a rectangular one. They
also left the jalousie windows in the bathroom and kitchen. Luckily,
most of the old redwood framing was still in good shape.</TE>
<TE>   The price was further kept down because Linares gave them a family
discount and because he did much of the work himself with a few
helpers rather than hiring subcontractors. This method of renovation
can save money in subcontractor profits but generally takes longer.
In this case, the project was slowed down by two events: a death in
the family and a monthlong bus strike that made it necessary for
Linares to pick up his main helper.</TE>
<TE>   Construction started on the house in May 2000. Jenkins and
Gonzalez worked on it too, scrubbing, cleaning and even hanging
drywall. In August of that year, they rented their Venice house and
moved into the front bedroom of the Del Rey house, living there
during the last months of construction.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the wood floors, hidden under black grime, could be
salvaged. Where they were too far gone, slate tiles were used in
their place. At only $1 per square foot, it was an economical yet
elegant substitute. The fireplace and its tile could not be salvaged
but a new fireplace matches the old one.</TE>
<TE>   Safeguarding the existing tile during heavy carpentry and drywall
phases took extra effort, including laying heavy planks over the
pink-and-maroon kitchen counters and the green-and-black bathroom
counters. The bathroom's original black pedestal sink was retained
and the chrome on the old Thermador heater restored. One item was
broken during construction: the black porcelain toilet tank cover.</TE>
<TE>   Some tile was lost when the arch was cut through the kitchen wall,
and more would have been lost if a side wall had been removed to
incorporate a service porch into the kitchen space. Gonzalez was in
favor of that but Jenkins couldn't bear to lose that wall of history,
as well as the old icebox on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, a small wooden gate was built to match as closely as
possible the gate on Keller's house.</TE>
<TE>   After Linares was finished in March 2001, the couple worked on the
house for another year. They painted the exterior a dark gray-green,
the bedroom tangerine and the bathroom its original lavender.</TE>
<TE>   The landscaping design revolves around pathways of broken concrete
and existing plants they chose to retain, including banana trees,
castor bean tree, bamboo and creeping fig. The rest of the large lot
is filled with drought-tolerant natives or Mediterraneans that
attract birds and insects.</TE>
<TE>   The couple invested about $225,000 in the house and its
renovation, along with countless hours of labor. They have seen two
other homes sell in the neighborhood for $450,000 or more. Gonzalez
is already searching for another fixer. "It's a hobby," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he and Jenkins don't expect to sell this house. They haven't
even sold their tiny Venice cottage. As Gonzalez explains it, "We get
attached."</TE>

<HD>Lease Spells Out Rules on Guests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H. MAY SPITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you invite a guest to stay at your place, are you inviting
trouble as well?</LD>
<LD>   Most leases have specific rules regarding guests, which, if
ignored, can have an impact on your pocketbook or even prompt an
eviction. Lease language about guests can vary from requiring
registration of visitors with the landlord to charging an
extended-stay visitor.</LD>
<LD>   Guests are usually defined as any person who stays beyond a
designated number of days, varying from 10 days to four weeks. The
number of guests allowed is also specified in most leases.</LD>
<TE>   Why does your landlord care if you share your place? Because
guests can turn into permanent residents, and anyone who resides on
the property has to be screened and pre-approved. Just because you
think someone is terrific doesn't mean his or her credit and personal
history are, too.</TE>
<TE>   Another concern regarding guests is the other residents. Neighbors
like to know who is living in their complex. For safety and security,
guests are prohibited or are often limited to a length of time they
can stay.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, I received an e-mail from a tenant who was alarmed by a
stranger using the laundry room. "I struggled to find a great
apartment, and now this guy is here without anyone knowing who he
is," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Even though tenants are granted exclusive use of the facilities as
specified in their lease, their guests usually are not given the same
rights. Further, if a guest causes damage or injury, the tenant may
be held responsible for the guest's actions while on the property.
Another landlord concern is illegal subletting. Sometimes a guest
moves in and the original tenant moves out.</TE>
<TE>   How can you be evicted for just having a guest? Because an illegal
guest who hasn't been approved by management may be a violation of
your rental agreement and violations lead to citations.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the citation could be written notice from your
landlord to correct the violation. Usually the letter is called a
Three-Day Notice to Perform Covenant or Quit. A covenant is defined
as a "binding and solemn agreement between two or more parties."</TE>
<TE>   Because the covenant has been violated, you will be put on notice
to remedy the problem. At that point you can either approach the
landlord about allowing your guest to become a resident or toss the
guest out. Like an umpire, if the landlord says "out," then your
guest must indeed leave. Exceptions do exist, such as in Santa
Monica, so check your locality for details.</TE>
<TE>   If the landlord approves of your new guest, get all agreements in
writing to confirm your new arrangement. Once an agreement is made,
your rent may be raised for the additional resident, even in cities
with rent control.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the rent-controlled units may be raised up to 10%
for a guest, though minor dependant children are exempt.</TE>
<TE>   Rent increases are arguably the biggest source of conflict between
landlords and tenants. Because an additional resident uses more water
and common area space and equipment, some local laws allow the owner
to collect the additional sum.</TE>
<TE>   What if your lease is outdated? Can you still be evicted? That
depends on the city you dwell in, but evictions are not
do-it-yourself projects. Whether or not you're out the door hinges on
several factors. If you are unsure on how to handle any notice from
your landlord, especially eviction, consult an attorney for details.
In most places, including cities with rent control, illegal guests
are universally accepted as grounds for eviction though specific laws
and codes vary from city to city.</TE>
<TE>   For information, call the housing agency for your city.</TE>
<TE>   My advice about guests? It's best to get written permission from
the owner first.</TE>

<LD>"A nightmare" is how Donna Bohana characterizes the Southern
California real estate market for buyers.</LD>
<LD>   "Lately everything is going over asking [price]," said the agent
from Coldwell Banker, Malibu Colony. Inventory is low. And multiple
offers are the rule rather than the exception. For instance, Bohana's
last four deals, all in the San Fernando Valley, were multiple-offer
situations.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a lot of disappointed people," she said.</LD>
<TE>   But there are plenty of happy ones too. After all, in each
transaction, someone ends up a homeowner.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, it's serendipity. Public relations professional
Jennifer Barry was strolling in Venice with her mother late last year
when they saw an attractive house under construction on one of the
coveted pedestrian-only walk-streets. Barry, who had been casually
looking for several months, thought little of it. But her mom decided
to talk to the contractor. Turns out he was building it on spec.
Friendly negotiations followed and Barry eventually sealed the deal.
Usually it's not this easy, however.</TE>
<TE>   Writer Andreas Samson said he and his schoolteacher wife, Wendy,
have a "tale of woe" (which has a happy ending) that began about two
years ago. That's when the two started "looking heavily." Their goal:
"a house that felt like home" on a quiet street for about $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   "For us it was really kind of readjusting what we would consider,"
Samson said. "We started looking in Larchmont. Then we were priced
out of Larchmont."</TE>
<TE>   They moved on to Silver Lake. Again, they were priced out.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing happened in Echo Park, then Atwater Village. "It
became the Valley by default," Samson said.</TE>
<TE>   Samson spent a good part of every day poring over the listings on
www.real tor.com. Anything new that came up that looked like a
possibility, he'd drive out to see that very day.</TE>
<TE>   "It got to the point where a listing would go up in the morning
and in the afternoon, we'd pull up and there'd be like two or three
cars racing to the curb," he said. The Samsons put offers on eight
different properties. Eight times, they lost out.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day in February, agent Lucy Matsumoto of Prudential
California Realty, Beverly Hills, who was referred to them by a
friend, showed them a half-dozen homes in Van Nuys. One was a
two-bedroom "tucked away in this little working-class neighborhood,"
Samson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the best of the ones we saw. But I wasn't
personally crazy about it. Our agent said, 'You are going to be
priced out of this neighborhood right now and you should buy this
house.' All my alarm bells went off. Was I being conned?"</TE>
<TE>   "We ended up writing an offer," Samson said. "We were the first
people to write an offer and it was accepted. So we got the house and
lo and behold, by the time we closed escrow, we could not buy in this
neighborhood. It worked out exceptionally well."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Smith, chief executive officer of JS2 Communications, bought
in April on his fourth try.</TE>
<TE>   Before "the one," he lost out on two houses and a condominium in a
celebrated old building on Rossmore Avenue in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   It helped that Smith saw and bid on the Hollywood Hills property
he ended up buying the first day it was available for showing, even
before a formal open house. Still, his wasn't the first offer. There
was already one other.</TE>
<TE>   It also helped that Smith knew the market well enough to recognize
that the house--in an area where comparable listings were ranging
from $400,000 to $2 million--was "really well-priced."</TE>
<TE>   "You're always told to buy the least expensive house in the best
neighborhood," Smith said. "And while this wasn't the least
expensive, it was at the comfortably affordable end. That gave me
some flexibility on upgrading within my budget."</TE>
<TE>   "I bid full price because I had already been down that road with
the condo," Smith said of a failed purchase offer on another property
he had made for less than asking price. And because he knew the
sellers wanted a long escrow and the option to lease back for 45
days, he included those terms in his offer.</TE>
<TE>   "They accepted my offer right away," Smith said. "And after
looking at houses for nine months and really educating myself, I can
honestly say I got the best house at the best price in the best
area."</TE>
<TE>   To ensure they would be the successful buyers of a Pasadena
bungalow they saw in April, Jim Dunn, a writer, and Lisa Hansen,
communications director for Los Angeles City Councilman Jack Weiss,
heeded the advice of their agent, Matty Hurtado of Coldwell Banker
Old Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing she said you can do is make your offer simple," Dunn
said. "So we went in lean and mean." They offered a bit over the
asking price and even assumed all responsibility for termite repairs.
They also submitted a letter of introduction with their initial bid
that included a list of reasons they liked the house as well as a
photo of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "[The sellers] said, 'Thank you very much. We'll take your offer,'
" Dunn recalled. "There were no counters. The sellers even sent us a
little note about how much they thought we would love the house, the
great neighbors next door and how they hoped we would raise a family
here."</TE>
<TE>   To give their clients an edge, many agents are taking buyers out
on "caravan" to brokers' open houses, which take place Tuesdays on
the Westside and Fridays in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys.
Often this is the first time a house is shown.</TE>
<TE>   Some agents, however, are holding open houses the Sunday before
the broker's open. Sometimes the hope is that a buyer will walk in,
fall in love with the place and write an offer through the listing
agent. If the offer is accepted, the agent has just doubled his or
her commission.</TE>
<TE>   In situations where it is clear a property is going to generate a
lot of interest, Bohana has several suggestions. But first, she asks
her clients a critical question: Do you really want this property? If
the answer is "yes," Bohana said, "I give them their options." These
include putting down more than the usual 3% good-faith deposit.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have to come up with 20% in the end [anyway],"
Bohana said, to avoid paying private mortgage insurance.</TE>
<TE>   In one recent deal, Bohana's client wrote a deposit check for
$56,000 rather than the expected $17,000. "It showed that this guy's
serious," she said. Besides, who doesn't like to see a big check?</TE>
<TE>   "The second thing I do is try to shorten the escrow period,"
Bohana said. "Even if the owner wants to move out in 45 days, I'll
have it close in 14 days and the owner can stay there." That's 31
fewer days a seller has to worry about a deal falling through.</TE>
<TE>   "I also cut down on the inspection period," she said. "Instead of
14 days, I do seven."</TE>
<TE>   Coco Clayman-Cook, an agent with Prudential Beverly Hills, uses
many of the same tactics. She also often includes financial
statements when she presents an offer on behalf of a client.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to show the seller that they, [the buyers], have the
balance of the funds," she said. "Anything you can do to make the
seller confident in you, you're in better shape."</TE>
<TE>   "If a person knows they are going to get a loan," she added,
"maybe remove the loan contingency. If it's you up against four other
offers and you don't have a loan contingency, you're looking a lot
stronger."</TE>
<TE>   A contingency on the sale of the buyer's home can also handicap an
offer. Consequently, Clayman-Cook advises buyers who have written
offer after offer with a home sale contingency to go ahead and put
their home on the market. In such a competitive market, she said,
"you have to be a little bold."</TE>
<TE>   One thing's for certain. "You can't sleep on it," Bohana said. "It
will be gone. If you think you like it when you walk in, don't go
home; go to your Realtor's office. Timing is everything right now."</TE>

<HD>Interest-Only Loans Not Ideal</HD>

<AU>JACK GUTTENTAG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: In looking to refinance my existing mortgage, I've found
some lenders offering interest-only loans. One lender is offering an
interest-only option for 10 years. Because I plan to be in my current
house for no more than 10 years, this seems attractive. The monthly
payment is lower than that for a fully amortized loan, and because
the payments are all interest they're 100% tax-deductible. Am I
overlooking something?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Yes. A mortgage is interest only if the monthly payment
does not include any repayment of principal. So long as the payment
remains interest only, the loan balance remains unchanged.</LD>
<LD>   If a 30-year fixed-rate loan of $100,000 at 6.25% is interest
only, the payment is $520.84. Otherwise the payment would be $615.72,
of which $94.88 is amortization. This $615.72, the "fully amortizing
payment," is the payment that, if maintained over the term of the
loan, will pay it off completely. If a loan were interest only for
the full term, the balance would be the same at term as it was at the
outset.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1920s, loans of this type were the norm; borrowers
typically refinanced at term. But the Depression of the '30s caused
many to go into foreclosure, and lenders stopped writing the loans.</TE>
<TE>   Hence the interest-only loans of today are interest only for a
specified period, usually five to 10 years. At the end of that
period, the payment is raised to the fully amortizing level. In such
cases the new payment will be larger than it would have been if it
had been fully amortizing at the outset.</TE>
<TE>   The surge of interest in interest-only mortgages today seems to be
related to concerns about how best to manage personal finances. It is
a healthy shift in attitude, provided that you are focused on the
right objective. For most, that objective is to accumulate wealth
during the working years to afford a comfortable retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Wealth equals assets less debt. It is built up over the years by
accumulating assets and paying down debt, especially mortgage debt.
When you pay down the balance of your mortgage, you are increasing
your wealth by reducing debt. But an interest-only mortgage does not
increase wealth in that way.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you may be increasing your wealth by accumulating
assets instead. If you have such a plan and you have determined that
it is more effective in building wealth during the interest-only
period than paying down mortgage debt, fine. Paying down mortgage
debt is the most effective way to build wealth, especially in today's
financial environment.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose you have a 6.25% mortgage and your financial plan calls
for increasing your wealth this month by $100. If you put it in the
bank, you may earn 2% to 4%. If you put it in bonds or stock, you may
earn more but you take a risk. If you use it to reduce the balance of
your mortgage, you earn 6.25% with no risk at all.</TE>
<TE>   The tax saving on mortgage interest does not affect such
comparisons because you must pay taxes on interest earnings. Suppose
you are in the 39.1% tax bracket. Then your 6.25% mortgage costs only
3.81% after taxes, but a 4% CD yields only 2.44% after taxes. The
investment that is most advantageous before taxes is also most
advantageous after taxes.</TE>
<TE>   With the stock market in the tank and most short-term interest
rates below 2%, mortgage loan repayment is the best investment
available to most homeowners.</TE>

<HD>Same Man, Same Ground</HD>
<DH>Hussein was ours to take, and we blew it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans look ahead anxiously toward Baghdad. I can't help but think
back angrily. It's an old habit, a grudge I carry with me from
Vietnam.</LD>
<LD>   I think about the spring of 1991: The ground shook all that
Wednesday night at forward operations base Viper near the Euphrates
River in southern Iraq. Out in front of us, the Air Force and Navy
pounded Saddam Hussein's retreating Republican Guards. I was a
correspondent in the desert with the fastest-moving elements of the
Army, but even we weren't fast enough to keep up with this rout.</LD>
<LD>   Apache AH-64 helicopters were spread across the desert, their
fighting power momentarily silenced. They had flown ahead of
resupply. In this "turkey shoot," they had simply run out of gas.</LD>
<TE>   I've kept the operations maps in my files. Basra was to the east
of our combat base. Once fuel supplies arrived, our path would surely
lead west and north into the capital. A tyrant was about to fall.
This chalky dirty landscape, the cradle of civilization, was going to
get another try at civilization. Troops at Viper pawed the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at 8 o'clock Thursday morning, we gathered around a
short-wave radio. "Victory," said the scratchy voice of President
George H.W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   A scattering of cheers replaced the rumble of bombs. But the joy
was half-hearted and melancholy. The war was over but not completed;
a soldier's lament. "I hope it's not going to stay over," a captain
from Kalamazoo, Mich., told me. "I want to get rid of Saddam."</TE>
<TE>   Why stop when we were winning? Why pull up when the enemy was
surrendering by the tens of thousands? Why go home when Sad'em, as
Bush called him, was finished, except for the finishing?</TE>
<TE>   Dick Cheney was in on that war. And Colin Powell. Now they're
promoting this new one for Bush's son. We're told that American
fighting men and women will have to go back to Iraq and start over
again, as soon as the administration has done its prep work and
softened up public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   I cannot swear in the newspaper. But if I could, I'd swear like a
rank soldier to tell you how disheartened this makes me.</TE>
<TE>   Already in my life, as a Marine sergeant in Vietnam, I watched my
countrymen die because faint-hearted, stubborn and politically
calculating men made lousy decisions in Washington. Once in a
lifetime should be enough. Now it looks like we're going to have to
endure the same thing again.</TE>
<TE>   Our men and women in uniform are going to kiss their loved ones
goodbye. They'll be lined up and inoculated with strange medicines to
try and protect them against chemical weapons attack, just as we
were. Then ships away, lock and load. They'll go fight the same man
for the same ground a second time.</TE>
<TE>   That's inexcusable.</TE>
<TE>   If Saddam Hussein is worth taking out now, he was worth taking out
then. Nothing has materially changed in 11 years. Certainly not
Hussein. I have no idea what darkness really lurks in the man's
heart, but today's demonizing of him reads from the same script
without variation: Obsessed about an A-bomb, willing to use chemical
weapons, devious troublemaker, oppressor of his own people, a
terrorist foe of the West, etc. Except this time we'll be the
aggressor, not him. Only this time, he's likely to be more desperate.
Only this time, he may have more friends in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein was ours for the taking back in 1991, and at a cost of
remarkably few battle casualties. Our fighting forces proved their
stuff. The military had spent almost three decades trying to learn
the lessons of Vietnam so as not to repeat them. But the biggest
mistake in Vietnam was not the military's. It belonged to a
succession of presidents and their brain trusts, who called things
wrong in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   The war drums of 2002 tell us it's happened again. Back in the
spring in 1991, the White House ignored the wisdom of military
philosopher Carl von Clausewitz, who long ago put it this way: "The
aim of war in conception must always be the overthrow of the enemy."</TE>

<HD>LAPD Confidential: Let's End 40 Years of Bad Juju</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES ELLROY</AU>
<BD>James Ellroy is the author of "L.A. Confidential"
(Warner Books, 1990) and a memoir, "My Dark Places" (Alfred A. Knopf,
1996).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm an LAPD observer of 40 years standing. I've watched cops, I've
written about them, I've spent a few nights in their lockups. They
have been lauded, unduly decried and misrepresented across a wide
sociopolitical spectrum. Despite the many brickbats hurled at chiefs,
from William Parker through Daryl Gates, the Los Angeles Police
Department has clawed, bungled, PR-blitzed and pushed its way toward
public accountability--many times under duress--since Parker's
appointment in 1950. County commissions, city boards, federal
look-see overseers--the LAPD's sizzled under hot interrogation room
lights and got hit upside the head with a phone book. The councils,
media scrutiny, changing times rife with attendant protest have
served as interrogation props. It's out in the open now. All the LAPD
wants to confess.</LD>
<TE>   It just isn't working. The old ways are moribund. The new ways are
yet to be defined. L.A.'s overpopulated. The LAPD is understaffed.
It's been 40 years of divisive bad juju. The '60s to the '90s
constituted no police-citizen love fest. Rodney King, the '92 riots,
the repugnant and racially ratified O.J. verdict and Rampart--what a
bring-down! Many people are vying for the new chief's position. They
know that old-type hard-line chiefs won't survive. They know that the
last two chiefs blundered and floundered and wobbled behind the
assumed wishes of L.A.'s '92 post-riot citizenry--and withered behind
scores of civilian complaints, many genuinely proffered, most cheap
attempts to pick the pocketbooks of that long-term blue boogeyman.</TE>
<TE>   Today's society bops behind fatuous concepts of retribution,
reparation and payback time. That cosmic welfare check will never
arrive. A new LAPD chief will arrive, but will he or she strike the
necessary philosophical balance? Know where the LAPD has been, and
thus glimpse the road it should travel? Be able to mount a hybrid
street presence: essential, aggressive police work and a new
cross-cultural civility? The LAPD has long suffered a self-imposed
isolation, steeped in the noble loner myth cooked up by Jack Webb and
Chief Parker. The new chief will have to say, "That was then, this is
now--and here's what we're going to change."</TE>
<TE>   Among the 13 finalists for chief is Cmdr. Jim McDonnell. He's
smart; he's experienced; he's dedicated. We've spent evenings
discussing where the LAPD has been and where it should go. He's an
aggressive conciliator. He thinks in big pictures and reduces them to
street discourse size. He loves L.A. He'd love to fire up the troops
to fight crime in the new and wild and woolly and multicultural L.A.
He revels in the minutiae of everyday police work without ever losing
sight of the human aspect.</TE>
<TE>   Our most recent LAPD chiefs have been long on circumspection and
short on hard leadership skills. The new chief has to stride forth
forcefully, as Parker did 50 years ago, but without "Whiskey Bill's"
racial attitudes and martinet personality.</TE>

<HD>Bug-Free Ballot Boxes</HD>
<DH>Take the time to ensure that the technology in polling
booths actually works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD L. HASEN</AU>
<BD>Richard L. Hasen is a professor specializing in
election law at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles. E-mail:

<DL></DL>
<LD>It is easy to snicker at Florida's second election fiasco in two
years. But amid the chuckles, we run the risk of missing the danger
signs for the presidential election of 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Electoral problems extend well beyond Florida, and California may
just as likely be the butt of jokes next time around.</LD>
<LD>   Political and legal forces have compelled states to update their
voting technology with lightning speed.</LD>
<TE>   Eager to avoid a repeat of the 2000 problems, Florida's
Legislature barred the notorious punch-card ballots. California,
Georgia and Illinois all faced lawsuits challenging the use of
punch-card systems as violating new equal protection rights that the
U.S. Supreme Court seemed to recognize in its Bush vs. Gore decision.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the California suit brought by Common Cause and
others, Secretary of State Bill Jones agreed to eliminate punch-card
voting in the state, replacing it with technology like touch-screen
voting.</TE>
<TE>   Jones had wanted to wait until 2006, but the plaintiffs demanded a
2004 deadline, which the federal judge agreed to.</TE>
<TE>   The 2004 date may be the cause of much trouble because of the
decentralized nature of our elections and the learning curve
associated with any new technology.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has worked in an office knows that when the technical
folks install a new system, it takes a while to work the kinks out.
Multiply that problem across hundreds of voting precincts staffed by
volunteers (many of whom may not be computer savvy) and the potential
for chaos is apparent.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one of the problems at a Miami polling place Sept. 10 was
the poll workers' failure to plug in the voting machine.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 2000 Florida fiasco, election officials already were
phasing in touch-screen voting in Riverside County and parts of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also commissioned a study on the possibility of Internet
voting.</TE>
<TE>   Both of these efforts recognized that training and testing are key
to a successful electoral system.</TE>
<TE>   The rush to get everything in place by 2004 eliminates the chance
to phase in new technology.</TE>
<TE>   The result may be a greater equal-protection problem than the one
the lawsuits are designed to eliminate.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of voters could be disenfranchised because of technology
breakdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Even if California gets its act together, problems across the
country should be expected.</TE>
<TE>   Congress began work after the 2000 election on a comprehensive
election reform bill, though that effort remains bogged down in
partisan wrangling over whether methods Republicans have proposed to
prevent fraud will discourage poor and new voters (likely to favor
Democrats) from voting.</TE>
<TE>   Many states and localities have put their plans for election
reform on hold until Congress provides funding. If and when that
money comes through, they could try to move too quickly to change
their systems.</TE>
<TE>   Given how closely divided the country is along partisan lines,
voting problems in 2004 could affect who holds the majority in
Congress, if not the presidency. Not to mention the public's faith in
the machinery of democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we need voting reform.</TE>
<TE>   But we need to get it right more than we need to get it fast.</TE>

<HD>Scorched-Earth Tactics Ultimately Burn All of Us</HD>
<DH>We must consider environmental damage from war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SCIGLIANO</AU>
<BD>Eric Scigliano writes on the environment for the
Seattle Weekly.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, in the U.S. Air Force's Air &amp; Space Power Chronicles, Col.
Richard Fisher published what many of his peers might consider rank
heresy.</LD>
<LD>   "As a general consideration," Fisher wrote, "the U.S. should
include environmental effects as an issue of central value along with
politics, economics and social effects when deciding whether or not
to wage war.... It may well be that the potential long-term
environmental risk ... outweighs the importance of other
considerations."</LD>
<LD>   Are we ready to weigh environmental impacts in the calculations of
war? We certainly notice them after the shooting stops. Farmers,
elephants and other creatures in Cambodia, Angola and many other
countries still are regularly killed by shells and land mines left
from old wars. Children still are born crippled and deformed in
Vietnam, three decades after U.S. planes stopped spraying Agent
Orange and other herbicides. Forests leveled in Civil War battles
still have not entirely recovered.</LD>
<TE>   Such consequences seem predictable in hindsight; in the heat of
war they tend not to be foreseen or even considered. Iraq, however,
affords a rare chance to weigh environmental impacts beforehand, try
to prevent or mitigate them and perhaps choose not to risk them. The
last war there gave a preview. It's not a pretty picture.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1991, the world watched in horror as Saddam Hussein's
troops unleashed one final, spiteful assault of their own. They
opened the spigots on Kuwait's vast oil reserves and detonated its
wells, releasing what was far and away the largest oil spill in
history. About 60 million barrels--more than 200 times as much as the
Exxon Valdez spilled--oozed onto the ground, forming 246 black,
lifeless lakes. It took nine months to put out the 613 oil-well fires
spewing dark clouds that covered the region, lowering local
atmospheric temperatures an average 10 degrees Celsius. Physicians
now await the cancer toll in those who breathed this oily air.</TE>
<TE>   Even before allied bombing began, Iraqi troops had begun releasing
10 million barrels of oil into the shallow Gulf waters, hoping to
forestall a seaborne invasion--by far the largest marine spill in
history. The slick coated nearly 1,000 miles of coastline.</TE>
<TE>   American and Iraqi tanks chewed up the hard-packed desert, a
particularly fragile ecosystem. Afterward, Kuwait's top environmental
official reported that shifting dunes covered twice as much of the
country as before, and dust storms rose to record levels.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the Swiss-based Green Cross International assessed the
extent of recovery and lingering environmental effects in Kuwait. The
Gulf's waters showed surprising resilience in the short term; shrimp
harvests were back to normal and coral reefs appeared healthy, unlike
reefs elsewhere. But in 2000, the Manchester Guardian reported a vast
die-off of fish, apparently caused by surging nutrient levels that
choked off oxygen. Kuwaitis blamed this surge on Iraq's draining the
southern marshes to punish the Shiite marsh-dwellers who, at U.S.
urging, had rebelled against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The land and the water beneath the land proved more vulnerable.
Green Cross reported that the Kuwaitis had collected a third of the
pooled oil, but the rest continues to seep through the sand. Oil has
contaminated at least 40% of Kuwait's freshwater reserves, leaving
less than a two-month supply--a thin margin if the next war knocks
out desalination plants.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the U.S., anguish and controversy continue to fester over
the cryptic, chronic symptoms afflicting a reported 100,000 Gulf War
veterans, despite $200 million spent on studies. Across Iraq,
thousands of armor-piercing depleted-uranium shells--one suggested
cause of Gulf War syndrome--continue their slow nuclear decay.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwait's postwar disaster is commonly described as unprecedented:
"For the first time in the history of warfare," the Encyclopedia of
the Gulf War intones, "a retreating army destroyed the environment."
But the Iraqis merely practiced one of the oldest tactics in warfare.
Like the Russians who burned their own capital as Napoleon
approached, the Romans who (if legend is true) salted the ground
where Carthage stood, and prehistoric hunters slaughtering mega fauna
to starve rival bands, they scorched the Earth, denying resources to
their enemies.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that today the means of scorching are vastly
grander and more diverse. Hussein never employed the most feared--his
chemical and biological arsenals--in 1991. But he was never cornered
then, and he still had Kuwait's oil to spit at his attackers.</TE>
<TE>   In any future Iraq war, the clean-up guys in white moon suits may
play as big a part as the grunts in desert camo.</TE>

<LD>Mohammad Yasin Malik once advocated violent rebellion against India's

several years, he emerged to advocate nonviolence. He is the kind of
Kashmiri leader India should seek to engage. Instead, the government
arrested Malik for allegedly receiving money from foreigners and
jailed him under the terms of a law that can keep him behind bars for
months without trial.</LD>
<LD>   As state elections in what is formally known as the state of Jammu
and Kashmir begin Monday, the government has failed to reach out to a
coalition of two dozen political organizations and discuss how to end
13 years of violence that has killed tens of thousands.</LD>
<LD>   Kashmir is India's only predominantly Muslim state and was the
cause of two of the three wars between India and Pakistan. Both claim
the territory. Tensions in Kashmir this year led the two countries to
station a million troops along their borders.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually New Delhi and Islamabad will have to agree on the
status of Kashmir, but the starting point should be the wishes of the
Kashmiris. Some want alliance with Pakistan, others independence,
others continued inclusion in India. But governments in New Delhi
have rigged balloting in the state for years to ensure local
legislatures amenable to New Delhi's wishes. They have pounded their
political anvil with a ferocious military hammer, using violence in
the state at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan, meanwhile, has let terrorists train on its land and slip
into India on murderous rampages. Washington pressured Pakistan into
agreeing to stop those forays, but extremists already in Kashmir
continue to attack. Last week, they killed a state government
minister and several supporters at an election rally.</TE>
<TE>   The main coalition of opposition political groups, of which Malik
is a leader, has vowed to boycott the elections, which continue into
October. The coalition insists that federal and state governments
release jailed political leaders and stop human rights abuses. Those
reasonable demands have been rejected. Separately, Muslim militants
have murdered candidates who have defied orders not to take part in
the elections.</TE>
<TE>   India should have encouraged full participation in free and fair
elections, rather than kept Malik and others in jail. Washington has
a major stake in peace between India and Pakistan and must keep the
pressure on both sides to solve the main sticking point: Kashmir.</TE>

<HD>Congress Misses the Mark</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that both houses of Congress have voted overwhelmingly to arm
airline pilots, it's up to a conference committee--presumably
unarmed--to decide whether this pell-mell, all-American airborne arms
race measure goes to the president for approval. We suggest that
discussions refocus on the merits of cockpit weapons, not their
caliber.</LD>
<LD>   In a singularly unattractive election year stampede, Congress
members including California Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein
have caved in to the--presumably unarmed--pressures of pilots who
would like guns in the cockpit as the last line of defense against
terrorist hijackers. How about locking the reinforced cockpit door
instead? And whatever happened to cockpit Tasers? Bearing batteries
and wires isn't as Wild West as packing heat--but is considerably
less lethal for all at 30,000 feet. Alas, the administration is
muting its opposition to cockpit guns, leaning toward a pilot test of
pilot guns.</LD>
<TE>   Resolved, no one wants anything less than the safest airlines.
We're already investing billions in airport security to keep weapons
and bombs off planes. Is it worth $900 million more to establish
training for any or all of the estimated 85,000 pilots to actually
carry firearms onto these planes? Plus another $250 million annually
to maintain the program? Pretty soon taxes on airline tickets will
exceed the fares themselves. Cross-country round trip: $189, plus
airport taxes, landing fee assessments, security enhancement costs,
air marshal tips, fuel surtax, luggage inspection charges, metal
detector tax, body-frisk fees, ammo allotments and your total will be
$409.99. Plus a surchange for an e-ticket that saves the airlines
labor, postage and paper.</TE>
<TE>   True, most pilots, at least those not apprehended portaging
cocktails to the cockpit, are skilled professionals--at flying.
Flying by the seat of your pants in storms is one thing; launching a
well-aimed bullet inside a pressurized aircraft is another. That's
why we have metal detectors and air marshals--and need more. Even
airplane owners and initially the pilots union opposed the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The idea raises so many disturbing questions. Is having a pilot's
license, a commercial job and volunteering to pack a piece sufficient
qualification? What about background checks? Can pilots pack pistols
after landing? What if hijackers seize a pilot's pistol?</TE>
<TE>   And what's next in our society's impromptu arms race to increase
security? Arm folks at the metal detectors? At ticket counters? How
about arming bus drivers and schoolteachers? We could arm fans at pro
football games too. (Oakland's already act armed.) We could have
tailgate marksmanship parties and stop selling ammo after the third
quarter to permit cleanup of shell casings and other debris.</TE>
<TE>   Giving guns to airline pilots is an idea that should be shot down
before takeoff.</TE>

<HD>School Standards Paradox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Math problem: If only 33% of California's schoolchildren meet the
state's new learning standards, and the federal government insists
the number must reach 100% within 12 years, at what point on the road
to achievement will the two figures collide?</LD>
<LD>   Possibly very soon, as state officials feel pressed to lower
expectations to avoid undeserved embarrassment.</LD>
<LD>   California forged its high standards after nationwide research but
before the federal "No Child Left Behind" law took effect this year,
proclaiming that all schoolchildren must be "proficient" at their
studies by 2014. Washington left it up to each state to define
proficient; by then, the state had set the definition as meaning on
track for education at a rigorous four-year university.</LD>
<TE>   The gap between aiming high but needing to look good in Washington
exposes a serious flaw in No Child Left Behind, a generally admirable
law that increases funding for disadvantaged students but makes
schools show they're boosting these children to better skills. It
sets annual goals for raising the number of proficient students and,
in its first six years, disciplines schools that fall short.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut, a high-achieving state, has responded to the law by
playing a trick with the word "proficient." Connecticut has long had
a high standard for academic mastery, which about 60% of its students
meet. But its board of education decided to define proficiency as
different from mastery, bringing in a lower band of students. Now 80%
of its students meet the mark. Ohio has taken similar action;
Michigan is considering doing so. California education officials
already predict that the state will lower its standards so that fewer
schools will fail under the federal act.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and Congress never meant to make it in a state's
interests to lower standards or play word games. In fact, the act
uses the lofty standard of the National Assessment of Educational
Progress as a measuring stick. But there it is: The lower the
definition of proficiency, the less chance a school will be punished.
Arkansas and Wyoming have set their bars low enough to report no
failing schools; that's no path to educational progress.</TE>
<TE>   Congress will revisit No Child Left Behind in six years, and no
doubt rejigger it, but Washington should not wait that long to build
more flexibility into the act, taking into account the high
expectations some states have set for their students and teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Must educators stop using student poverty and other social ills as
an excuse for teenagers unable to read Dr. Seuss? Absolutely.
California gets that message and has set its standards high, for both
students and teachers. The federal government cannot on one hand
demand high achievement and on the other hand reward states that set
a low academic bar. If it's a game we're playing, California can
follow the lead of other states and reset expectations so low that
any school can meet them--or California can be recognized as having
the most varied and diverse student body in the nation and get
federal points for steadily moving its schools toward true
excellence.</TE>

<HD>Honoring Ira Yellin and His L.A. Spirit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best way to remember and honor civic leader Ira Yellin (obituary,
Sept. 11) is to spend a Saturday afternoon in downtown Los Angeles.
Park your car near the Bradbury Building and have a look inside. If
you are there later in the day, with the autumn light streaming in
through the skylights, you would have to have a heart of stone not to
be moved. Stroll across to the Grand Central Market and absorb the
smells, the pulse and the energy of lives that don't leave at 6 p.m.
on weekdays. Walk up to Bunker Hill and north on Grand Avenue past
the last layers of skin on the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Walk past
the Music Center to Temple Street and visit the Cathedral of Our Lady
of the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Keep walking down Temple to the recently renovated City Hall.
Another block and a right will take you to the future home of Vibiana
Place [where St. Vibiana's Cathedral now stands]. Cross the freeway
and walk toward Olvera Street. Walk around the beautifully restored
Pico-Garnier block. Continue on to Union Station and stroll around
the terminal where time seems to stand still. Have a drink at Traxx
and look at the new site of the California Endowment headquarters.</LD>
<TE>   Indirectly, or directly, Ira Yellin inhabits all these places. One
man does not build a city; it is a communal spirit, particularly in a
city as large as Los Angeles, a spirit which, for me, Ira Yellin will
always embody. If you feel a little more pride in Los Angeles and
smile, you will be honoring a truly great man.</TE>

<HD>9/11: Gathering Our Leaders and Thoughts</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All of us at the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels are grateful
to you for the editorial that appeared on the anniversary of 9/11.
That afternoon, the cathedral was filled to capacity, with an
overflow crowd watching on an outdoor TV screen as the city's
ecumenical and inter-religious leaders gathered for prayer, readings
and song. This interfaith dimension of the cathedral is one of its
principal purposes, and we hope to see many similar gatherings. We
view the cathedral as a sacred space for all groups, not just
Catholics.</LD>
<LD>   We concur fully with your suggestion that the new conference
center serve as a gathering place at least once a year as a
"state-of-the-art think tank" for addressing the many needs and
issues of our entire community. That is one of the reasons the
conference center was developed on the site, and we look forward to
working with the civic community, nonprofit groups, religious
organizations, business leaders, our colleges and universities and
others to analyze our community's most pressing problems. The new
cathedral was built in the heart of the city precisely to become a
partner in solving the city's most vexing issues and to become a
place of dialogue.</LD>
<LD>   Our biggest challenge: Which issue should become the very first
one to tackle? We welcome the suggestions of The Times' readers.</LD>

<TE>   Your special section, "A Year After" (Sept. 11), was beautifully
done. Thank you for the heartfelt interviews. It's difficult to
understand a person like Karla Olivos, whose only concern is for
herself. How can she complain about her inconveniences in crossing
the border each day? Does she not know what a wonderful opportunity
she is being granted in being allowed to attend college here?
Hopefully she has read the moving stories you published.</TE>

Commentary, Sept. 11: John Balzar's reflection about America's walk
since 9/11, without trite sentiment, hit the mark and made me cheer.
We stand tall, now, as much because of what we refused to
do--alongside what we have done--since Sept. 11. Tolerance is our
strength, proudly not forsaken in our commitment to democratic
ideals. I am proud to be an American because of this and, of course,
a whole lot more.</TE>

<LD>I hope that if I am ever brutally murdered, it is not by some cunning
criminal who is able to put two words together and get the sympathy
of liberal intellectuals the world over ("Death Upheld for Crips
Founder," Sept. 11). Perhaps if Stanley "Tookie" Williams had devoted
his life to writing children's books before he slaughtered a father,
mother and daughter from a single family in cold blood he would not
have to rely on the support he receives from people who should really
know better.</LD>
<LD>   As a veteran police officer who has interviewed countless criminal
suspects, I know that some people are smart, charming and also
capable of vicious acts that leave their victims' families forever
devastated. People like Williams and Mumia Abu-Jamal [convicted of
killing a police officer] deserve the punishment that society
reserves for brutal killers, no matter how articulate they are.</LD>

<LD>In his Sept. 11 commentary, "Turning a Page in History," Pico Iyer
writes that in his recent worldwide travels, "Everywhere I go I come
away with the same impression: It's not Islam that's on trial
worldwide, but the USA." President Bush and Vice President Dick
Cheney, with their very vocal desire to declare war on Iraq,
certainly don't indicate that they are aware that this rhetoric not
only acts to inflame the Arab countries but most of the countries of
the world. Iraq is a problem for the United Nations; Bush should
recognize this and be using his influence on that institution rather
than on our individual allies.</LD>

<HD>Student Dress Codes Reveal the Parents' Attitudes</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Wrinkles Seen in Dress Policy," Sept. 11: All three of my
daughters went K-12 through the L.A. school system, and I have
watched with growing frustration the emergence of fashion policing. I
suspect it is a myth that the majority of parents support these
increasingly restrictive and invasive dress codes. The one school my
kids attended where the issue was actually put to a vote by all the
parents (not just a committee) it was resoundingly defeated, 83%
against.</LD>
<LD>   When one of my daughters was a senior in high school (San Pedro
High), a parent volunteer told me her skirts were too short and her
tops showed too much cleavage. My daughter was on the cheer squad and
the school newspaper, was an active member of Earth Club, had been
working after school (part time) for the previous two years, didn't
smoke or do drugs, was in a three-way tie for valedictorian of her
graduating class and was the only churchgoing member of our family. I
would have found it difficult to tell her she was not "dressing for
success."</LD>
<LD>   Our kids are dealing with a lot of vital and sometimes scary
issues these days. Let's give them our support instead of adding
petty concerns to their already full plates.</LD>

<TE>   I was amazed at the parents' willingness to support their
children's inappropriate dress. One male parent worries at the
possibility that male teachers might be ogling at his daughter on
campus but complains when she is given detention for revealing too
much skin at her waist. Another parent complains that it will be too
difficult to replace her daughter's too-revealing new clothes. (Did
she bother to read the letter sent home warning parents of the new
dress code?) As a high school teacher, I often found most challenging
the task of dealing with such ignorance on the part of the parents. I
believe that adopting a school uniform would take care of the dress
code problem.</TE>

<TE>   How timely! Granada Hills High just contacted me because my
daughter was in violation of the new dress code. Her shirt did not
touch the top of her pants, hence the showing of some skin; not even
a belly button, just skin. It's disturbing and scary how some
teachers are way overzealous in their interpretation of what this
code should include.</TE>
<TE>   Common sense has been negated to the point of degrading and
humiliating students. Recently my daughter was made to reach to the
ceiling so this same teacher could see how far her skirt came up. I
could support a dress code that focuses on tube tops, halter tops,
too-short shorts and skirts, but not to the extent that this policy
is being enforced. Why some teachers find it acceptable to go to this
degree--as well as the school administrators who are supporting
them--is disturbing.</TE>

<TE>   The father of the 17-year-old girl who was showing too much skin
at Granada Hills High School was concerned about what was going on in
the heads of the male teachers. He has it all wrong. He should be
much more concerned about what's going on in the heads of all the
17-year-old boys. (Or has he forgotten?) What may be appropriate for
Saturday night is not appropriate for Monday morning. I applaud
Granada Hills High School for placing learning above fashion shows.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Few Good Measures," editorial, Sept. 10: Your call to the
governor to sign "Laura's law" demonstrates ignorance of the law and
perpetuates stigma and discrimination against individuals with
psychiatric disabilities. It is false and irresponsible to state that
all individuals who could be caught in the net of AB 1421 are unable
to make "rational" decisions about their mental health care.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing in existing law prevents courts from offering or even
ordering outpatient services, including medication, for individuals
who cannot provide for their basic needs for food, shelter and
clothing because of a lack of understanding of their diagnosis. In
fact, with the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, conservatorships provide
for such assistance for up to one year.</LD>
<LD>   Counties do not implement existing law--with respect to voluntary
and involuntary treatment--because they lack the services to meet
individual needs. AB 1421 contains no appropriation and thus fails to
address the need for additional resources. AB 1421 and its supporters
scapegoat individuals with psychiatric disabilities for the absence
of services within the mental health system. Those who support the
bill are exploiting the stereotypes of violence and incompetence to
promote their agenda.</LD>

<LD>   White and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) are amplifying the
voices of a few fearful people who can't imagine positive change.

<HD>Why a War With Iraq Is Inevitable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion. E-mail: warkin@igc.org</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With war looming in Iraq, who is the only senior Bush official to
have actually ever laid eyes on Saddam Hussein?</LD>
<LD>   The answer--and the circumstances of the meeting--help explain why
our two countries are destined for war, as they certainly are. You
can hear it in the rhetoric of the countries' leaders.</LD>
<LD>   "To assume this regime's good faith is to bet the lives of
millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble," President
Bush said before the United Nations General Assembly last week.</LD>
<TE>   "The U.S. ... since its foundation was based on killing, usurping
others' rights," Hussein said in a July meeting of the Iraqi Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   For all the wistful pleading for a resumption of inspections and
diplomacy to avert war, the die has already been cast. There is
nothing that the U.N. can do because there is nothing that Iraq will
do that is acceptable to the U.S. The two nations don't just see
things differently: It's as if they aren't seeing the same things at
all.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, obsessed with the hostages being held in Lebanon and with
the fundamentalist government in Iran, President Reagan appointed
Rumsfeld as a special envoy to the Middle East. U.S. intelligence
believed Iran was behind the kidnappings (as well as the deaths of
241 Marines in Beirut when their barracks was blown up), and as part
of his mission, Rumsfeld went to Baghdad to open high-level contact
and seek Iraq's help in getting intelligence about Iran.</TE>
<TE>   The carrot offered by the U.S.--which did not want Iran to win its
war with Iraq--was a promise to begin efforts aimed at reducing the
covert supplying of weapons and spare parts to Iran by Israel and
others. The overt reward would be a reopening of diplomatic
relations, which were severed by Iraq after the 1967 Six-Day War.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld took two trips to Iraq, and on the first one, in December
1983, had a rare visit with the Iraqi president. According to
declassified State Department cables obtained by the National
Security Archive in Washington, Rumsfeld and Hussein talked about a
number of things. But, most intriguing to Iraq, Rumsfeld raised what
all thought was a dead idea: building a secure, $1 billion oil
pipeline from Iraq through Jordan to the Gulf of Aqaba.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld had every reason to think his trip had been successful.
On Jan. 10, 1984, the U.S. interests section in Baghdad sent a cable
to Rumsfeld and Washington saying that the Revolutionary Command
Council had approved the pipeline project. "Tarik Aziz had gone out
of his way to praise Rumsfeld as a person, noting that he was a good
listener and had presented the U.S. position in a convincing manner,"
the cable reported. A follow-up cable Jan. 31 said that "the Iraqis
will want U.S. firms heavily involved in the project," adding that
the Iraqis were "directly in touch with a major U.S. construction
company." (Later that year, the U.S. Export-Import Bank approved a
$425-million loan guarantee to Iraq for building the pipeline, and in
November, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad was reopened.)</TE>
<TE>   But it was soon apparent that the U.S. and Iraq saw the world
through very different eyes. Rumsfeld was sent to Iraq not because
the U.S. had suddenly decided that its regime was above reproach. In
fact, just before his second trip, the State Department had accused
Iraq of using proscribed chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington's view, Rumsfeld sat down with Hussein because it
had been decided that the U.S. and Iraq had common interests--however
limited. Although Baghdad had invaded Iran on Sept. 22, 1980, an
Iranian victory was unacceptable to Washington. This meant the U.S.
was willing to engage in covert efforts to get third countries to
supply Iraq with weapons. In the year after Rumsfeld's visit, the CIA
began to secretly supply Iraq with intelligence on Iran. That
operation soon blossomed into a larger military exchange, one that
continued until 1988 under a succession of code names: "Elephant
Grass," "Druid Leader" and "Surf Fisher."</TE>
<TE>   If there's one thing that defines Iraqis--and has proved their
downfall in war crimes investigations--it is their compulsive
record-keeping. They prepare transcripts of all important meetings,
and they obsessively read and reread the transcripts looking for
clues to the subtext of foreign interests.</TE>
<TE>   According to State Department cables, the Iraqis, in poring over
their transcripts of Rumsfeld's meetings during his two trips to
Iraq, noted one thing above all others: his silence on the issue of
chemical weapons, even though his second trip came soon after the
U.S. had accused Iraq of using them in the war. In considering the
meetings, the Iraqis also noted that while Rumsfeld named Iran, Syria
and Libya as supporters of terrorism, he did not name Iraq. These
things seemed highly significant to the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   They further misread the U.S. position in 1988, when the Iraqis
used massive amounts of chemical weapons in March in Halabja, against
the Kurds, and then in April on the Fao peninsula, against the
Iranian army. Though there was a ferocious internal discussion in the
Pentagon about whether the U.S. should continue to provide assistance
to a country that used such weapons, the cooperation continued to the
end of the war, something the Iraqis read as tacit approval.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. never considered Iraq more than a partner of
convenience--and then only for the limited purpose of tamping down
Iran's power. But from the Iraqi perspective, the Americans' ongoing
provision of intelligence information and willingness to work on a
Jordan pipeline deal symbolized true U.S. interest in Iraq--even if
that interest, as Iraqis believed, was largely financial.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder that Iraq, which had participated in the web of
covert relations with the U.S., also misunderstood the U.S. in 1990
when the invasion of Kuwait was imminent?</TE>
<TE>   And it continues not to understand. At an Iraqi Cabinet meeting on
Jan. 28, according to transcripts released by the U.S. government,
Hussein complained: "They are bombing Baghdad, Basra and ... then
they say that their pilots are acting in self-defense because the
Iraqi antiaircraft artillery threatens them? So is the case for the
Zionist entity. It is occupying Palestine. [Yet ] when Palestinians
defend their home, family, land and the holy sites ... [the
Americans] consider this a terrorist act."</TE>
<TE>   For the Iraqis, everything is equivalence. They firmly believe
that Iraq is no different in its actions than the U.S. For the last
20 years, they have repeated the same litany of U.S. "abuses," from
Hiroshima to Panama to Israel. In a meeting with Ministry of Military
Industrialization officials just after Sept. 11 last year, Hussein
suggested that the U.S. deserved the attacks: "Regardless of the
controversial human feelings, America harvests the thorns that its
rulers planted in the world," he said. The U.S. "never left any place
in the world without a symbolic memorial for its criminal acts," he
added. "No one crossed the Atlantic Ocean carrying a weapon against
them over history, but it was America itself that crossed the
Atlantic Ocean carrying death, destruction and offensive exploitation
to the whole world." In another Cabinet meeting earlier this year, he
complained about U.S. "greed" and "moral weakness" and pronounced the
U.S. a tool of "the Zionist entity."</TE>
<TE>   Given what seems to be its leaders' actual--if highly
distorted--perception of the U.S., Iraq's intransigence is not
surprising. Nor is Rumsfeld's disgust that the alliance of
convenience he formed in 1983 has come to such an ugly end.</TE>
<TE>   "I have met with Tarik Aziz a number of times, both in Baghdad and
Washington and elsewhere," Rumsfeld said of Iraq's deputy prime
minister earlier this month, dismissing Iraq's current diplomatic
flurry to stave off war. "Clearly, he does the bidding of his master,
Saddam Hussein. They have, over a good many years, demonstrated a
wonderful talent and skill at manipulating the media and
international organizations in other countries."</TE>
<TE>   And so we move, inevitably, to war. "By breaking every pledge--by
his deceptions, and by his cruelties--Saddam Hussein has made the
case against himself," Bush said at the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that Hussein has made a damning case against himself.
But the history of the U.S.-Iraq story is deeply complicated, and
veterans like Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell should have a clearer strategy based upon their
experience.</TE>
<TE>   They have abandoned without explanation President Clinton's
strategy of "containment until regime change." Instead, they have
insisted that Hussein might well use weapons of mass destruction to
confront the U.S. and that this necessitates a war in which the
stated objective is "regime change." This goal more or less
guarantees that Baghdad will employ chemical or biological weapons,
if it has them, in pursuit of its national survival.</TE>
<TE>   From Hussein's point of view, one way or another, it's beginning
to look like he'll end up a martyr to American lawlessness and
morally weak intimidation. Why not go out with a bang?</TE>

<HD>Interest Rate Cure Turns Into a Malady</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>David Friedman, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a
senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As midterm elections approach, a volatile stock market and sluggish
recovery have made many a politician long for the Clinton
administration's economic policies. In 1993, the federal government
imposed stiff tax increases to reduce budget deficits so interest
rates would fall. Soon afterward, there was a boom. Today, the red
ink is flowing again in the public sector, and there's talk of
aborting the next phases of the Bush administration's tax cut to
lighten government debt burdens, keep interest rates low and trigger
another economic miracle.</LD>
<LD>   But Americans' investment strategies have dramatically changed in
recent years, and that transformation has altered how interest rates
affect government finance. In the mid-to-late-1990s, low rates
stimulated investments that ultimately produced a bonanza for
government coffers. Today, savvy investors are using them in ways
that are starving government.</LD>
<LD>   Then-Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin was the chief driving
force behind the 1993 tax hikes. He believed that government
borrowing was sapping the nation's economic vitality by keeping
interest rates too high. Money that could be invested in stocks,
business start-ups or other wealth-creating activities was instead
parked in high-yield CDs or Treasury bonds. If taxes were raised,
Rubin contended, interest rates would fall and people would make more
productive investments.</LD>
<TE>   It's hard to know if Rubin was right. Interest rates were dropping
before Bill Clinton became president, and they only exhibited a
sustained decline after 1997, when the Asian financial crisis forced
the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy to keep the world economy
afloat. But there's no denying that hundreds of billions of dollars
moved out of savings and retirement accounts into stocks after the
tax increases. Venture capital became plentiful. Stock-driven
earnings boosted high-end executive incomes and produced huge tax
windfalls. Public budgets that had long bled red ink were in balance.
America was suddenly blessed with what many thought was endless
prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   But Rubin's economic strategy can't save us today, for many
reasons. The U.S. trade deficit, which also affects borrowing rates,
is incomparably larger today than in the early 1990s. Oil and other
import commodity prices are far more volatile. U.S. manufacturing was
expanding in 1993, not declining at the most rapid pace in a century.
And the post-Cold War euphoria that enabled Congress to cut billions
from defense and further shore up the federal budget evaporated after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, with interest rates already near historic lows, it's
difficult to believe that cheap money is our most pressing economic
problem. And the idea that tax increases are needed to drive
borrowing rates even lower is especially risky when consumer spending
is generally cited as the main reason why the country has, so far,
avoided a double-dip recession. Why pinch America's pocketbooks at
such a crucial time in the hope of nudging remarkably low rates
downward a few more ticks?</TE>
<TE>   But even if, against all evidence to the contrary, mounting
government deficits are keeping interest rates too high, the public's
response to lower rates is quite different today. During the 1990s, a
combination of low savings yields, media hype and an unprecedented
comity between Washington and Wall Street transfixed investors with
the seemingly limitless prospects of the "new" economy. Everyone
invested in stocks and largely ignored other investments, like real
estate. The decade's obsessive focus on paper equities produced
almost all that period's stunning fiscal benefits.</TE>
<TE>   When the stock market collapsed, resourceful investors transferred
their attention to more tangible assets, particularly tax-subsidized
residential real estate. Put another way, they abandoned the kinds of
investments that produced windfall income gains and increased tax
revenues. Exploiting home-refinancing opportunities, higher-income,
high-tax-paying Americans, in particular, now manage their wealth in
ways that dramatically reduce government income.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two years, for example, about $4 trillion in new
home mortgages was financed in the United States, an all-time record
volume. More than half of these transactions were refinancings--a
higher-interest loan was replaced by one with a lower rate--unrelated
to buying a new home. This, too, is a very high ratio. By contrast,
refinancings accounted for just about 30% of all new mortgages from
1994 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   More important still, more than 60% of the most recent refinancing
activity, or roughly loans totaling $2.4 trillion, were "cash out"
transactions. Borrowers retired their old loans and secured tens of
thousands of dollars to spend as they wished. All this extra cash was
financed with tax-deductible real estate mortgages.</TE>
<TE>   This financial pattern represents the greatest difference between
today's economy and that of the 1990s. In the heyday of the boom,
people financed their consumption by selling what were often wildly
appreciated paper assets, and they paid correspondingly enormous
taxes on their earnings. Since stock-price speculation was so
extreme, consumers, in most cases, had more than enough money left
over for cars, vacations or fancy furniture even after paying the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Americans are generating disposable income by refinancing
homes, cashing out their equity and charging the interest on their
new mortgages against their taxes. Refinancing old loans, even at
lower rates, generates a larger proportion of currently deductible
mortgage interest with each new loan payment. Cash-out transactions
add hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tax-deductible interest
on top of these amounts. All this is generating billions of dollars
of new tax deductions that are further straining public budgets.</TE>
<TE>   It seems folly to argue that tax hikes, or canceled tax cuts, are
critical to assure lower interest rates, particularly if they
stimulate even greater tax-avoidance borrowing. People are looking
for safe ways to build and spend wealth. Tax-subsidized real estate
financing has clearly emerged as their strategy of choice. And with
each dollar of increased borrowing, they draw funds from increasingly
challenged public budgets. That's one reason why Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan called for more discipline in public
spending--not new taxes--during his congressional testimony last
week.</TE>
<TE>   There is no quick-fix tax and interest-rate panacea for America's
current economic challenges. In any case, it seems especially
inappropriate to look to one of the most profligate decades of U.S.
history for guidance. Instead, we have no choice but to rebuild our
now-declining productive economy and encourage steady, rational
savings and investment.</TE>

<LD>In most elections, the top of the ticket drives the down-ballot
contests. In most elections, the total number of votes declines as
you move down the ballot. But California's election is shaping up to
defy this conventional wisdom.</LD>
<LD>   The turgid gubernatorial contest and a lack of hot-button
initiatives on the November ballot have further estranged an
alienated electorate. Voters' dissatisfaction with their electoral
lot is palpable.</LD>
<LD>   A recent survey by the Public Policy Institute of California
indicated that 54% of likely voters were not satisfied with their
choice of gubernatorial contenders. According to the latest Field
poll, a majority of likely voters view both Gov. Gray Davis and his
Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr., more unfavorably than
favorably.</LD>
<TE>   There is anecdotal evidence that some Californians will go to the
polls and just leave the governor's line blank. So grim is the
situation that a write-in campaign for former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, who lost to Simon in the GOP primary, has not drawn
laughs.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, "boutique turnout" generated by a smattering of local
issues and races up and down the state, among them secession
measures, will help play a major role in defining the electorate and
that, in turn, may affect the governor's contest and other up-ticket
races, rather than the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, certain statewide ballot initiatives have so
galvanized the public that they drove the whole election. In 1982, a
gun-control initiative helped the Republican gubernatorial nominee,
George Deukmejian, squeak by Democrat Tom Bradley. Estimates were
that the rural vote increased by 5% to 10%. This pro-gun, largely GOP
electorate voted against the initiative, then stuck around to vote
for Deukmejian.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Proposition 187, which denied certain services to illegal
immigrants, helped Gov. Pete Wilson clobber his Democratic
challenger, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. More than 7.8 million
Californians voted on the proposition, while the vote total for the
two major parties' candidates for governor was roughly 300,000 less.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13 is perhaps the most striking example of how voters'
interest in a ballot measure can eclipse contests for elective
office. About 6.5 million votes were cast on the
property-tax-limitation initiative, which passed overwhelmingly in
California's 1978 primary. Roughly 700,000 fewer votes were cast for
all 19 gubernatorial candidates in party primaries. Legislative
nominees, dubbed "Prop. 13 babies," rode the anti-tax fervor to
victory in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the races and issues likely to motivate voters don't
involve the statewide electorate. The highest-profile ones are the
Valley and Hollywood secession measures. The city of L.A. accounts
for roughly 10% of the state's registered voters, and both sides of
the secession fight have promised a concerted get-out-the-vote
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation was that Valley secession could boost Republican
turnout. A July Los Angeles Times Poll indicated that roughly
two-thirds of the city's GOP voters favored secession. Fifteen
contests for local Valley offices (should the new city be approved),
involving more than 100 candidates, could also motivate
high-propensity Republican voters.</TE>
<TE>   The race for Valley mayor is competitive. Among the candidates are
moderate GOP Assemblyman Keith Richman and longtime Valley Democratic
activist Mel Wilson. Richman, who is also running for reelection in
his Valley-centric Assembly district, has the most sophisticated
campaign organization and fund-raising apparatus.</TE>
<TE>   But it may be Davis and the Democrats who get a boost from the
secession issue. Politically powerful L.A. unions are putting their
muscle and money behind the anti-secession campaign. Labor's
political operation, said Miguel Contreras of the L.A. County
Federation of Labor, will be focused primarily on getting union
members, a key Democratic constituency, to the polls to oppose
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Labor has given Davis strong support. In 1998, when unions
statewide pushed their members to the polls to defeat Proposition
226, which would have required written permission to use a member's
dues for political activities, their numbers helped catapult Davis
over two better-funded opponents in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos constitute the largest ethnic bloc in L.A.'s unions.
According to The Times Poll, Latino voters citywide oppose secession,
45% to 36%, while a majority of Valley Latinos support independence.
Even those who turn out to vote for secession aren't likely to swoon
over Simon; they're more likely to stick around to vote for Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll indicates that Jewish voters, another important
Democratic constituency, oppose secession regardless of where they
live. Citywide, they're against secession 57% to 34%; a majority of
Jewish voters in the Valley are also opposed.</TE>
<TE>   African-American community leaders say they'll be targeting black
voters against secession; these voters will likely go Democratic once
they're in the voting booth.</TE>
<TE>   The well-heeled anti-secession campaign is looking to push all
these constituencies to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   On the Santa Barbara County ballot, the galvanizing issue is a
vote to recall Supervisor Gail Marshall, a member of the county
board's three-person "liberal" majority. Many northern county
residents resent the liberals because they tend to support stringent
environmental regulations to protect the charm of the south coast at
the expense of the economic progress of farmers and ranchers in the
north.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall's district includes all these contentious constituencies.
If northerners and conservatives turn out, Republicans could benefit.
If Marshall's more liberal and environmentalist south county allies
come through, Democrats could have the edge, which could help Rep.
Lois Capps in her reelection fight with GOP candidate Beth Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   Although most contests were settled in the March primaries, there
are a few November races whose turnouts could affect up-ticket races.
The hottest is the fight in the Central Valley's 18th Congressional
District to succeed Democratic Rep. Gary A. Condit, who lost in the
primary. The race has national significance because it could help
decide the high-stakes tug-of-war for control of the closely divided
U.S. Congress.</TE>
<TE>   There are other examples of boutique turnouts that might skew this
election's political demography. For example, the California Target
Book calls the fight for Assembly District 30 in Central California
"one of the most competitive races in the state, pitting a liberal
Democrat (Nicole Parra) against a conservative Republican (Dean
Gardner)" in a district whose Latino registration has increased 6%.
And voters in the Sacramento community of Rancho Cordova appear more
engaged by a vote on cityhood than by up-ticket races.</TE>
<TE>   It takes a lot to motivate voters--money, message and more.
Usually, the top of the ticket sets the pace. But this election could
prove a case of "the tail wagging the dog." And, boy, what a dog this
election is.</TE>

<DL>SANTA CRUZ</DL>
<LD>Whether Nevada voters approve or reject the Marijuana Policy
Project's ballot initiative to legalize marijuana for adults,
rational drug policy is the loser. A "yes" vote would change little
in a state that has legalized gambling, gives counties the option of
legalizing prostitution and where pot possession by adults, even
after three arrests, is a misdemeanor.</LD>
<LD>   What has changed is the drug policy debate. Reform groups like the
Marijuana Policy Project now embrace harsh "war on drugs" ideas they
once vehemently opposed. For example, the Nevada initiative, while
entitling adults 21 and older to buy and possess up to three ounces
of marijuana, would constitutionally require the state legislature to
"provide or maintain" criminal penalties for persons under 21.
Maintaining Nevada law means a young person caught with a single
joint would face a $5,000 fine, four years in prison, a felony record
and permanently jeopardized student loans, government benefits and
employment.</LD>
<LD>   The executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, Robert
Kampia, has claimed that his group's proposed initiative would "end
the arrest of all marijuana users." Since half of all pot arrestees
are under 21, Kampia's claim cannot be true.</LD>
<TE>   Drug wars traditionally feature two elements. The first is an
official crusade to link feared drugs to feared populations--the
Chinese to opium, blacks to cocaine, Mexicans to marijuana,
immigrants to alcohol, underclasses to heroin. The second is the
lobbying of privileged groups for drug-use exemptions. Upper-class
patronage of opiates, cocaine and bootleg liquor was rarely punished.
Governors are not evicted from publicly funded residences because
family members violate drug laws; indigent public-housing residents
are.</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada initiative similarly invites grown-ups to exempt their
own cannabis partying from criminal sanction even as they condone
ever-crueler punishments for today's drug-war scapegoat--young
people. It doesn't matter that neither the Marijuana Policy Project
nor anyone else has shown an apocalyptic difference between marijuana
use by a 17-year-old and a 40-year-old--or, better, a 20-versus a
21-year-old--that would justify such different treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "Marijuana Myths, Marijuana Facts," the reformist Drug Policy
Alliance's bible, reviews hundreds of scholarly studies and reports
none showing marijuana more harmful for adolescents than for adults.
While a few users in all age groups become dependent, marijuana is
not an addictive or so-called gateway drug leading to hard-drug
abuse. Rather, as government-impaneled commissions consistently
conclude, the biggest marijuana danger to young people is getting
arrested for using it.</TE>
<TE>   The Marijuana Policy Project and other reform lobbies have
jettisoned the scientific rigor they once championed in favor of
emotional appeals to public prejudice, a staple of drug-war
proponents. They twist facts wholesale to support their new position
that pot is a fearsome menace to youth in the hope of gaining
political popularity. The marijuana-legalization groups invoke as
their model a failed U.S. alcohol-regulation system world-famous for
fostering drunken excess, further evidence of how these reformers
have embraced the worst aspects of the drug-war regime.</TE>
<TE>   Kampia, recently told CNN that because marijuana is illegal and
unregulated, "the federal government's own surveys show that, year
after year, high school seniors find marijuana much easier to obtain
than alcohol or cigarettes." He never specified which federal surveys
he had in mind. The only federally funded survey of high school
seniors, "Monitoring the Future," consistently draws the opposite
conclusion. Furthermore, teenagers actually get and use legal,
regulated alcohol and cigarettes two to 25 times more often than any
illicit drug.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing shocking about that. It's normal for adolescents to
experiment with adult behaviors. Accordingly, if Nevada's pot
initiative passes, teenage marijuana use is likely to increase. After
the Netherlands legalized marijuana, surveys conducted by the Trimbos
Institute found that pot smoking tripled among Dutch youth. While,
two decades ago, Dutch teens used marijuana one-third as often as
U.S. teens, today the levels are equivalent, another matter both drug
reformers and drug warriors misrepresent.</TE>
<TE>   What reformers should be emphasizing is that the Dutch
successfully implemented health measures to reduce hard-drug abuse by
shifting resources away from policing youths and adults who use mild
drugs. By contrast, the dismal campaign surrounding Nevada's
initiative finds both sides hyperventilating over whether someone
under the age of 21 might light up.</TE>
<TE>   The fatal flaw in U.S. drug debates, past and present, is that
while drug crises are real, the feared scapegoats rarely cause them.
Addiction to opiates and cocaine was far more serious among white
middle classes than among blacks or Chinese a century ago, just as
today's white 40-year-olds suffer heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine
abuse rates many times higher than teenagers or young adults of any
color. Trumpeting drugs as a horror foisted on mainstream society by
feared minorities and young people evades the fact that middle
America harbors the most addicts.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side in today's drug war will face up to this reality.
Ultimately, the misguided debate over the backward notion of reform
embodied in the Nevada initiative aggravates the uniquely American
panic of young people acting like adults, ensuring perpetual
teen-drug scares and endless wars on drugs.</TE>

<DH>Taking the pulse of the country on a coast-to-coast
Greyhound bus trip</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTOR MERINA</AU>
<BD>Victor Merina is a former Times staff writer and fellow
for the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. He lived in New York as
a Freedom Forum Media Studies Center fellow.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>I have come to realize something after 66 hours on a Greyhound
traveling to New York and watching farewells at dozens of stops along
the way: The bus station is where you can properly say goodbye to
someone.</LD>
<LD>   Tenderly. Lovingly. Caressingly. With a last lingering touch at
the departing gate and without the glare of a security guard telling
you to push on.</LD>
<LD>   It's what farewells used to be at airports until the fallout of
Sept. 11 replaced romance with vigilance and left us to fling distant
kisses across rope lines and wave goodbye through plexiglass. But a
bus station remains open country.</LD>
<TE>   When I flew into New York shortly after 9/11 a year ago, it was on
a nearly empty airplane. Sand-filled dump trucks and armed troops
flanked my hotel, and usually confident New Yorkers jumped at each
siren. Now, I am taking an overland journey expecting to see a
revived America as the anniversary nears.</TE>
<TE>   But first what I see is this: When you board that bus in Los
Angeles to take the 3,079-mile journey east, the passengers are
likely to look a lot like, well, me. Dark skin. Black or deep brown
hair. Carrying backpacks or nondesigner suitcases or even plastic
grocery bags stuffed with belongings. A number speak another
language. Or move easily through a differing culture. Or feel
conspicuous in the majority one we have.</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, bus travelers are people who need to get
from here to there and are thankful that a $100 fare will take them
across the country. As it turns out, that discount fare can also
provide a glimpse of an America that rolls on in the shadow of 9/11,
because a bus can be a 55-seat neighborhood where life goes on in the
aftermath of terrorism and where a sense of community salves our
sense of loss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DAY ONE</TE>
<TE>   The security guard quickly stops me before I can board the bus at
the Los Angeles Greyhound station and places my carry-on bag on a
table. He makes a cursory check of my bag, partially unzipping the
compartment where my computer sits, and runs his finger along its top
without ever taking it out. Then he waves me on board.</TE>
<TE>   Security is not tight at bus stations because statistics appear
not to warrant it. About 70,000 travelers a day ride Greyhound, and
although there have been a few incidents of passenger violence since
9/11, none has been linked to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Not that any of this seems to worry anyone. Soon after passengers
find a seat, some are already dozing or reading or staring out the
window. As we pull out of downtown, there are two dozen people on
board as the bus driver recites the rules.</TE>
<TE>   No smoking. No drinking. No playing electronic devices without an
earphone. No loud talking.</TE>
<TE>   Later, as other bus drivers take the wheel, I will hear those
rules expand. No putting on nail polish or nail polish remover
because of the fumes. No stamping out cigarette butts on the outside
of the bus during rest stops. And, as one driver stresses repeatedly,
"No cussing."</TE>
<TE>   There is a rhythm to riding a long-distance bus with hours spent
on the road and then a quick 10-minute or 15-minute stop to pick up
or drop passengers or take a quick smoke. Or a 30-minute break to
wolf down fast food. After new passengers find their seats, after the
awkward introductions, conversations bloom, until strangers are
swapping life stories and photos of their families.</TE>
<TE>   Many people keep to themselves, but a few make an impact the
moment they step aboard.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happens at a small Arizona town when a tiny teenager
in denim shorts and black high-tops steps aboard in the late
afternoon. She looks to be alone and barely 16, if that. And when she
immediately leans back in her seat, her feet just touch the floor.
She struggles to unhook the carrier that holds her 2-month-old baby.</TE>
<TE>   The young mother speaks to no one except her child even though
other passengers have scrambled to help her stuff a box of toys in
one overhead compartment, her bag in another and the baby's car seat
next to someone else's feet. When people offer small talk, she is
polite but taciturn, and her neighbors give up. She only has eyes for
her baby--and her Game Boy.</TE>
<TE>   As the baby lies on the seat next to her, the young mother pats
his stomach with her left hand while trying to play the game with her
right. Eventually, she stops rubbing him altogether and merely coos,
keeping her eyes on the tiny screen and using both hands to play her
electronic game. After a few minutes, she puts her game down and
snuggles her baby. Soon there's a pattern. Snuggle and play. Play and
snuggle.</TE>
<TE>   As night falls and the baby starts crying, the young mother's
voice becomes less assured and more panicky. The person in front of
her--a newly married woman--offers a blanket and even a can of
formula she has been carrying in her luggage for the nephew she will
visit in Oklahoma. The young mother accepts both, but her frustration
mounts. She keeps trying to hold her baby and talk to him. She sings,
cajoles, feeds him, begs him to sleep and tells him that she loves
her baby, that she loves her baby.</TE>
<TE>   It works for a while. But when the baby begins crying even louder,
the young mother grows more insistent. Sleeping passengers awaken as
the baby wails and the mother's voice becomes even more strident. Her
lullabies now sound desperate, and the mother's words and her baby's
cries fill the bus until, in the darkness, you hear her outburst of
profanity.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, another voice can be heard and an older woman is
suddenly standing in the aisle next to the mother. She has walked
from her rear seat and explains that she is a grandmother and offers
to take the baby. The mother eagerly hands over her son, and soon the
crying stops as the grandmother alternately rocks the baby gently and
presses him against her. She turns on the reading light and shows the
young mother how to hold her baby and what to say to calm him, and
then recounts some of her own clumsy experiences as a new mother. For
the first time, you can hear a teenager's laugh.</TE>
<TE>   In the next seat, the young woman passenger who gave up her
blanket joins them and tells the teenage mother to keep it for her
son. "I take care of my nephew, and I want one of those some day,"
the smiling newlywed says, pointing to the now-sleeping baby.</TE>
<TE>   The weary mother does not smile back. "Maybe you do," she replies.
"Maybe you don't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DAY TWO</TE>
<TE>   In the daylight hours, I learn that the grandmother's name is
Bobbie Face, and she is on her way to Decatur, Ala., to see her three
grandchildren. The newlywed is 25-year-old Jennifer Weidemann, and
she is headed for Oklahoma City to see her parents before moving to
Germany with her soldier husband.</TE>
<TE>   The young mother and her baby are no longer with us, having left
the bus during a midnight stop at Holbrook, Ariz., and there is a
lighter feeling as the thought of the struggling mother and her
infant recedes with the miles. In fact, there is a growing sense of
family aboard as more people get acquainted and exchange histories.</TE>
<TE>   There is a young Native American couple headed for Oklahoma--"I am
an Apache-Kiowa," he tells me proudly--and a pair of sisters bound
for the Carolinas. There is a Swiss student traveling from Las Vegas
to Atlanta who listens to '80s music on his headphones, and a
Spanish-speaking couple taking pictures at each stop. And there is
Elizabeth Brady, who boarded the bus in Barstow and is on a trip to
Greenville, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Brady comes from a family of 11 siblings. She says that although
her father was raised poor in Mississippi with only a second-grade
education, he valued schooling and now his California daughter has
earned her own college degrees and works as a counselor for children
with behavior problems. She is on her way to help her father blow out
the candles for his 90th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Biographies and resumes and life stories have a way of spilling
out over a long-distance journey. Outside Shamrock, Texas, the
discussion turns for the first time to the Sept. 11 attacks. And for
the first time, voices are raised.</TE>
<TE>   "If an Afghani were to walk on the bus right now, I'd throw him
off," says Bobby Sweeney, an 18-year-old who graduated last June from
high school in Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "You're kidding," someone says. "I'm dead serious," he replies and
goes on to talk about the need to deal harshly with those who
threaten America.</TE>
<TE>   His critic jumps up to argue, accusing him of painting all Afghan
people with a brush that should be reserved for the Taliban and its
followers. She cautions him about discriminating against people
because of their appearance, and then warns him not to be so eager to
drop bombs on Afghanistan and other countries when the victims may be
innocent civilians, as well.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney's father is an ex-Marine. But, as it turns out, Sweeney's
antagonist--the newlywed Weidemann--is not only married to a soldier;
she has been one herself. "What I believe is that we have to protect
America at all cost," she says, "but not kill every Afghan citizen."</TE>
<TE>   The discussion about terrorism and 9/11 is rare on the bus. Some
people make it clear they don't want to talk about it. Others insist
their lives remain unchanged despite everything. Still others are
trying to forget the horror of Sept. 11. But Bobbie Face, the
grandmother with the soothing touch, cannot.</TE>
<TE>   She pulls a piece of paper from her bag and shows it to me. It is
a copy of a chain-letter poem sent to her last March from one of her
sons with a note reminding her that he loves her. She tells me about
another son who was working half a block from the World Trade Center
when the first plane hit. He was not hurt physically, she adds, but
....</TE>
<TE>   That son is her youngest, she says, and he has written his own
poetry about 9/11. He has never shown it to her. "I wish he would,"
she says, "because he is hurting, and I know I can help him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DAY THREE</TE>
<TE>   We arrive in New York City under the cover of darkness. It is not
yet 6 o'clock on the morning of Sept. 11, and as the unmistakable
skyline of the country's largest city rises before us, most of the
Greyhound passengers are asleep.</TE>
<TE>   But I am wide awake, listening for the heartbeat of a city that
was once my home--if only for a little while--and is now the rallying
cry for so many Americans who have never been here. On this day of
remembrance, those passengers who have departed along the way seem to
fill the bus with an unmistakable presence, an indefatigable spirit.
The travelers reflected what so many Americans are doing in this
post-9/11 world. They struggle with ordinary things and routine
lives. But they also find solace in strangers and strength in
community. They draw hope from one another.</TE>
<TE>   When we have parked for the last time, I find myself standing next
to Jobe Momodu and his wife, Kaumba. Momodu is a 41-year-old New York
City taxicab driver who emigrated more than a decade ago from his
native Gambia in West Africa. He is returning now from visiting his
wife's family in Detroit, where he listened to relatives urging the
couple to leave New York. But standing in the bowels of the Port
Authority bus terminal waiting for his suitcase, he shakes his head
at the thought of moving.</TE>
<TE>   He is now, he says, smiling proudly in the dankness of the
underground bus station, an American and a New Yorker. "I am happy,"
he says. "This is home for me."</TE>

<BD>Karrie Peterson is the government information librarian

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Knowing what government is doing is key to holding it accountable. To
get this knowledge, you need access to government publications and
documents. But recent trends threaten that access and may jeopardize
the promise of "e-government."</LD>
<LD>   The Office of Management and Budget is encouraging federal
agencies to bypass the Government Printing Office and let private
companies bid for their jobs. This way, public money can be saved.</LD>
<LD>   Although saving taxpayer dollars is commendable, there is little
agreement, even within the printing industry, that competition will
drop costs below those of the centralized Government Printing Office,
with its ability to command large-quantity discounts. But money isn't
the real issue here.</LD>
<TE>   The printing office has been pivotal in getting government
information into the hands of citizens through the Federal Library
Depository Program. When the government prints a federal agency's
publication, the Government Printing Office, as required by law,
e-mails copies to more than 1,300 depository libraries nationally.
The libraries store such publications for citizen use.</TE>
<TE>   The OMB claims Congress can't require the executive branch to do
its printing through the Government Printing Office. It concedes that
government publications should continue to be made available for the
depository program, though it doesn't specify how. But as is well
known in Washington, when agencies bypass, wittingly or unwittingly,
the Government Printing Office, their publications never reach the
depository program.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the Bush administration has veered away
from openness and toward secrecy, and not always for national
security reasons. Examples are numerous: Environmental information
made available under the Clean Air Act, such as how to cope with
chemical accidents, was removed from official government Web sites;
it's much harder to get government documents using Freedom of
Information laws; names of government appointees have been withheld;
the mandated publication of historical foreign-policy documents has
been delayed, as has the release of presidential papers of previous
administrations. Ironically, while it's getting harder to keep tabs
on government, government can find out a lot more about you, given
the expanded investigatory powers permitted under the USA Patriot
Act.</TE>
<TE>   A big chunk of government publications is in science and
technology. Guided by the principle that taxpayer-subsidized
scientific and technological research should benefit all, government
agencies from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to
the Department of Energy have made enormous strides in providing
access to research reports. But one bright star in this firmament is
about to disappear.</TE>
<TE>   PubScience is a free online, searchable database that indexes and
summarizes articles from more than 1,000 scientific journals that
have agreed to participate. It has been helping students, researchers
and ordinary citizens since October 1999. But the Department of
Energy is poised to pull the plug on PubScience because the service
competes with commercial products that are currently free. The
operative word is "currently" because there is no guarantee that the
no-cost commercial services will stay around or that they will be as
comprehensive as PubScience.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the information industry has contended that the
government should not compete with private business. If PubScience is
terminated, it will no doubt demand that other government-sponsored
indexes--medical, education, etc.--be replaced by commercial ones.
But let's be honest about the difference: How long will a commercial
index be freely distributed to libraries and who will preserve it?</TE>
<TE>   E-government won't give us the access that the OMB threatens to
take away. With electronic publishing, federal agencies can easily
mount and remove documents on their Web sites, and an
Internet-capable computer makes it possible to download everything
from national park brochures to tax forms. A lucky researcher may
happen upon a publication today, but will it be there tomorrow?</TE>
<TE>   In the traditional depository program, each government publication
is cataloged by government and library. This means there is a
permanent record of government publications and documents.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, without the oversight of the Government Printing
Office and thousands of depository librarians, government information
that exists on a few government-controlled servers can quickly
disappear through negligence, technological mishap or, in the case of
controversial or embarrassing information, political shenanigans.</TE>
<TE>   In these different scenarios, the official line is that loss of
access will be more than offset by cost savings, greater national
security, a stronger printing market or the convenience of
e-government. But what exactly is the trade-off?</TE>
<TE>   We are being asked to accept a contraction of our right to hold
our government accountable by insisting that the public record be
complete and accessible. But as Patrick Henry said, "The liberties of
a people never were, nor ever will be, secure, when the transactions
of their rulers may be concealed from them."</TE>

<KH>SECESSION</KH>
<HD>The Next Great Water War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT V. PHILLIPS and KENNETH W. DOWNEY</AU>
<BD>Robert V. Phillips is former general manager and chief
engineer of the L.A. Department of Water and Power. Kenneth W. Downey
is a former assistant city attorney.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Local Agency Formation Commission and Valley Vote are grossly
misleading the public when they say secession would not affect water
and power rates in a new Valley city or a breakaway Hollywood. Los
Angeles' water rights and its exclusive authority to set rates flow
from the state and federal constitutions, as well as state and
federal law governing water rights. Accordingly, if the Valley or
Hollywood secedes, their water rates will increase at least 23%, the
current cost of water from the Metropolitan Water District, not Los
Angeles' own cheaper sources. And because they would no longer be
part of Los Angeles, the new cities would have no way to fight back
politically.</LD>
<LD>   Early city leaders and voters recognized the importance of their
exclusive rights to water from the Los Angeles River and Owens
Valley. Language in the City Charter still reflects their views: "no
... water or water rights owned or controlled by the city can be
sold, leased or disposed of, in whole or in part, without the assent
of two-thirds of the registered voters of the city voting on the
proposition." A simple majority vote, the requirement for secession
set by LAFCO, does not trump this provision.</LD>
<TE>   About 34% of L.A.'s water comes from the MWD. Because MWD water is
roughly 23% more expensive than its own supplies, L.A. has always
used the water to satisfy its needs after first drawing upon its less
costly resources. This 23% rate increase would not be aimed at
getting even with the Valley or Hollywood. Historically, the city has
charged outside customers 20% to 35% more for water depending on the
cost of MWD water. Universal City and West Hollywood pay the higher
rate now.</TE>
<TE>   It's safe to say that Valley residents and businesses would
protest a rate hike. But they would do well first to recall, before
the secession vote, what happened in 1992. That year, a water
"conservation" rate was imposed throughout the city. Because their
lots are larger and their summer temperatures higher, Valley
residents were the hardest hit. Residents were so angry that the rate
became an issue in the mayoral campaign. Soon after he assumed
office, Mayor Richard Riordan, who carried the Valley in the
election, reconvened the committee that had recommended the rate.
Once the Valley was heard, the rate was lowered.</TE>
<TE>   If Valley residents voted to secede, they would have no similar
influence. A water rate can be structured in a way that could
adversely affect the Valley--as happened in 1992--even though the
rate is the same on both sides of the Santa Monica Mountains. LAFCO's
requirement of equal rates was an attempt to prevent a rate increase
in the Valley and Hollywood, but even that measure offers little
protection. Participation in citywide elections is what protected the
Valley in 1992. But supporters of secession are, in effect, asking
Valley residents to sign off on "taxation without representation" for
water, electricity and other vital city services.</TE>
<TE>   There is a lot more than money at stake with water rights. In the
semiarid West, water is scarce and getting scarcer every year, as the
population and the economy grow. Southern California has been
hard-pressed to meet water demand during droughts.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the conflict between drought-driven water scarcity and
economic development, the state Legislature passed two measures
requiring findings of "substantial evidence" of available water
supplies during a drought before a new development can be approved.
As the competition for water intensifies in future years, these
requirements will become more and more burdensome. Obviously, if
secession passes, Los Angeles will have to jealously guard its water
rights to ensure continued economic development. New cities would
have to go elsewhere to obtain water.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has perfected water rights and has proved itself a
tough and untiring defender of those rights. The question for those
pondering secession is what the future will hold if they lose the
fight for Los Angeles' water, because the chances are they will.</TE>

<KH>TERRORISM</KH>
<HD>The Shoes That Didn't Drop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAY TAYLOR</AU>
<BD>Jay Taylor was a deputy secretary of State for
intelligence and research in the Reagan administration.</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>We've spent the last year, in a sense, waiting for another shoe to
drop, for another dog to bark. But while a lot of things did happen,
certain shoes have not dropped. Some dogs have been silent. It's time
now to focus some attention on what hasn't happened.</LD>
<LD>   Despite fears of "fifth columns" and "sleeper cells" this past
year, no member of the American Muslim community of some 7 million
has committed a terrorist act in the United States. Most of us spent
the year waiting to hear the sound of cell doors slamming, for the
announcement from U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft that charges had been
filed against a significant chunk of those imprisoned after the
massive post-9/11 sweeps. More than 1,000 Muslim visitors, students,
illegal immigrants and other sojourners in this country were
detained. But, after many months, most were quietly freed and
deported. Finally, in the last week of August, the federal government
indicted five of the detainees, charging them with having links to Al
Qaeda. Four of these are foreign nationals. Only one is a U.S.
citizen, and he is a Denver native who converted to Islam. The
infamous would-be pilot Zacarias Moussaoui, of course, was arrested
before the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Although Ashcroft keeps warning that they are all around us, only
one or two Al Qaeda sleeper cells have been uncovered in the United
States--even if the five suspected terrorists arrested outside
Buffalo, N.Y., on Friday are proved to have Al Qaeda ties, something
not known at press time. One such cell--or even one individual, as
Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh demonstrated--can be extremely
dangerous. Extraordinary measures are called for--perhaps even a
$50-billion homeland security bureaucracy. But it appears that the
scope of Al Qaeda's organization and support in the U.S. is far less
than we had understandably feared after 9/11. Like a cobra in the
house, Al Qaeda is lethal, but once its presence is known, it can be
dealt with. The danger calls for safeguards, a focused search and
lethal eradication--but not for burning down the house.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing that hasn't happened, except in Pakistan and
Afghanistan, is an overseas attack by Osama bin Laden's terrorists.
Partly, this is because the Taliban and Al Qaeda were crushed in
Afghanistan. And partly it is because police around the world have
uncovered deadly plots and arrested many people suspected of having
Al Qaeda ties. Numerous governments, including our own, have frozen
suspicious assets totaling more than $140 million. As a consequence,
the Bin Laden terror organization now has no open base or sanctuary,
and its ability to raise and transfer funds is seriously diminished,
as is its command system. But if, outside of Pakistan and
Afghanistan, there are thousands or even just hundreds of dedicated
and trained Al Qaeda jihadists still wishing for martyrdom, it is
remarkable that they have not successfully launched another attack.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt at some point, somewhere in the world, Al Qaeda will
again launch a brutal attack on Americans, possibly a dramatic one.
That the group has not been able to stage such an assault since 9/11
does not suggest that it is less committed to these murderous
escapades--only that its global size and cohesion are not quite as
awesome as we feared.</TE>
<TE>   Some Americans would have us believe that Al Qaeda is not only
enormous in size but is also a highly sophisticated killing machine,
even on the verge of developing weapons of mass destruction. But the
videos recently obtained by CNN and CBS, as well as the scribblings
on yellow pads found during Operation Enduring Freedom, suggest that
while the group certainly had an interest in nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, its level of knowledge was about equal to what an
Internet-savvy high school student could pick up in an afternoon.
Certainly an Al Qaeda terrorist could use easily obtainable materials
to make a very destructive weapon--as did McVeigh. Theoretically the
organization could steal radioactive material. But all this is a far
cry from saying Al Qaeda itself is seriously "developing" weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda is an evil group. But let's not call it an evil empire.
It is a tiny fraction of the threat posed in the last century by Nazi
Germany, the Japanese Empire or the Soviet Bloc with its thousands of
nuclear missiles. Most prominent among the missing items since 9/11
is just this sort of perspective.</TE>
<TE>   If we could read the most secret files of the CIA operations
staff, we would almost certainly find another missing element since
9/11: any direct penetration of Al Qaeda by the agency. To expect
such an espionage coup by a Western clandestine service, though, is
not realistic. The CIA, even with perhaps another 1,000 agents on its
post-9/11 rolls, will almost certainly be unable to recruit a source
with access to the leadership levels of Al Qaeda. The role of the CIA
in the penetration game will primarily be in exchanging information
with and providing support to friendly secret services in Muslim
countries. With the destruction of the Al Qaeda infrastructure, the
most important single weapon we have in this struggle is the
cooperation of law enforcement and intelligence agencies in Arab and
other Muslim countries.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing missing for the last year is, of course, Bin Laden
himself. But whether he is dead or alive, it seems unlikely that we
will see another more-or-less open camp of Bin Laden zealots as
existed in Afghanistan. Where clandestine groups are discovered, most
governments will be willing to liquidate them, assisted in some cases
by U.S. training and intelligence. There could be an exception, but
it is reasonably clear that in this long, post-Afghanistan stage of
the hunt for Al Qaeda, our smart bombs, special forces and lethal
covert action teams are likely to have a limited role, if any.
Nevertheless, some Americans--mostly civilians--are using the
anti-terrorist campaign to promote a further strengthening of the
U.S. armed forces--already far more powerful than all the other
military establishments in the world put together. The same is true
of the CIA, which is being rewarded for what Sen. Richard Shelby
(R-Ala.) has called its "massive intelligence failure" with a virtual
blank check.</TE>
<TE>   Something else we haven't seen so far is convincing evidence of
Iraq's involvement with Al Qaeda and the 9/11 attacks. A powerful
group in the Bush administration, Congress and the media has tried to
make the case that Bin Laden's crimes last September justify invading
Iraq and eliminating Saddam Hussein. And perhaps solid evidence of
Iraqi complicity will ultimately be presented. But Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld recently revealed how fervent desire can cloud the
mind when he charged that some Al Qaeda leaders were hiding in Iraq.
It turns out that the suspected fugitives are in northern Iraq, in
territory not controlled by Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Last but not least of the missing dogs of September is simple
honesty. The administration hasn't fully come clean on why it wants
to exploit the 9/11 horror to justify a "regime change" in Baghdad by
military means. One central factor appears to be that Iraq is the
enemy of Israel. There are high officials on President Bush's team
who see U.S. security interests as identical to those of Israel's
governing Likud Party. This view means accepting as a given that most
Islamic countries are hostile to the U.S. and must be crushed if they
get too powerful or cause trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Not coincidentally, the advocates of this grand strategy are also
the American unilateralists who insist that, in maintaining its
preeminence, the U.S. cannot be constrained by international law or
the views of other governments or peoples--especially the 1.2 billion
Muslims of the world. Invading Iraq promises the first victory in the
unilateralists' new, Kaiser Wilhelm-like doctrine of "preemptive"
war. Such an attack would also reinvigorate the president's role as
commander-in-chief. But Bush is not himself one of the unilateralist
ideologues. Despite all the frenzy, it is increasingly unlikely that
he will attack Iraq without allied, Arab and United Nations support.
Already he has disappointed the zealots by saying he would seek
congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next year, we will still wait anxiously for another shoe
to fall. We will nervously anticipate the barking of monster dogs.
But as the year goes on, and as we gain more distance from the events
of Sept. 11, 2001, let's also take note of what doesn't happen.</TE>

<DH>In 'Martin Eden,' Jack London gives us a hero bigger and
more complicated than we can bear</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BERMAN</AU>
<BD>Paul Berman is the author of "A Tale of Two Utopias:
The Political Journey of the Generation of 1968." His essay is
adapted from the introduction to a new edition of "Martin Eden," to
be published by the Modern Library later this year.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a passion for reading and study that some people feel
intensely and others never will: an extravagant passion that leads to
sleepless nights wandering from the bookshelves to the magazine
table, a passion for spreading open a book and caressing its pages,
for studying its fonts and its stitched and perfect bindings. It is a
passion for speech rhythms, storytelling and argument. It is a
cerebral passion but not just cerebral.</LD>
<LD>   The passion for reading and study tends to be wonderfully
ambiguous, an escape which also manages to be a passion for
self-assertion, a passion for succumbing to the personalities and
arguments of masterful writers and for mastering personalities and
arguments oneself.</LD>
<LD>   It is a playful passion and a passion for brain-wracking labor.
Sometimes the passion feeds on itself until it blossoms into very
nearly a sexual passion, partly an ache and partly a thrill,
something felt with the skin and the muscles as much as with the head
and the heart, a desire.</LD>
<TE>   The French philosopher Roland Barthes wrote about this passion,
which he called, slightly mischievously, "The Pleasure of the Text."
Writers, according to Barthes, are seducers prowling for lovers.
Readers are innocents hoping to be seduced. Literature is flirtation.</TE>
<TE>   But it takes more than a philosopher's skill to speak passionately
about a passion, and surely one of the strangest of those
descriptions, one of the most disturbing, appears in Jack London's
novel "Martin Eden."</TE>
<TE>   London wrote "Martin Eden" in 1909 when he was 33. He was already
universally admired for having produced "The Call of the Wild" (the
greatest dog novel ever written) and his tales of the Alaskan gold
rush, a hero of the typewriter who celebrated his success by voyaging
at huge expense through the South Seas, all the while pounding out
his daily quota of words. He wrote "A Piece of Steak" on that
expedition.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly he worked on "Martin Eden." The book recounts what was,
by 1909, a familiar tale: the story of a young man who clambers
upward from dark anonymity into the glamorous world of literary fame,
only to reel in horror at the crassness of the magazines and the book
publishers and the crafty hypocrisies of the upper class.</TE>
<TE>   George Gissing wrote a version of that story in "New Grub Street,"
about the literary life of England in the 1880s, and likewise Balzac
in "Lost Illusions," about the literary life of France in the 1830s.
(All novels about young people trying to make a career in literature
are called "Lost Illusions.") But Gissing and Balzac were insiders in
the world of publishing, grizzled veterans who knew how to sprinkle a
sophisticated dust over their portraits of struggling writers and
sinister editors. London was an outsider's outsider. He was a bitter
young man from the California working class, self-taught, without
advantages in life, a tough guy who actually did go to Alaska and
hunt for gold, not that he found any.</TE>
<TE>   The charm of "Martin Eden" rests in good part on London's early
experiences. There is a pathos in the opening scenes: young Martin
entering the home of the wealthy Morse family, Martin all too aware
of his sailor's gait and unpressed pants and workingman's syntax,
Martin terrified by table manners, Martin panicked by the servant's
effort to bring him food, Martin sputtering with amazement, "You've
gone to the university?" Every one of those details, in its
precision, appears to have been lifted directly from memory. But
London's special inspiration in "Martin Eden" was to take those
tender and accurate working-class observations and charge them with a
muscular and even sexual energy, slightly addled.</TE>
<TE>   Martin gazes at the Morses' ethereal daughter, Ruth, and falls in
love and gazes at a pile of books on the table, and likewise falls in
love. The girl; the books. The books; the girl. Maybe the books more
than the girl. And he plunges into a campaign to conquer the books
and the girl, alike. This is the heart of the novel: Martin's 19-hour
days of reading and study, his pilgrimages to the Oakland Public
Library, his grand assaults on mathematics (which defeats him) and
philosophy (where victory is his), his effort to write his own
stories and poems and essays, his submissions to the magazines, his
failures, his zeal to succeed. And at nearly every station of his
campaign, a peculiar cloud of oddly violent sexuality hovers
overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Martin and Ruth discuss Longfellow. "A wave of intense virility
seemed to surge out from him and impinge upon her." She can't take
her eyes off his neck. A "wanton thought" crosses her mind. She would
like to put her hands on his neck. Her own "undreamed depravity"
shocks her. London says of Martin, "The old familiar blaze of health
rushed out from him and struck him like a blow." The images are
volcanic. Lava seeps upward.</TE>
<TE>   But how long can a volcano go on erupting? A simple ambition keeps
Martin motivated, at the start. But once his byline has begun to
appear in the magazines and even on books, once he has made himself
acceptable to the hoity-toities of the upper class, his
disillusionment is sharp.</TE>
<TE>   The cheap commercial spirit of the magazines does not escape him.
The fabulous world of the educated elite begins to look tawdry. And
his energy turns angry, sometimes with justice, sometimes in ways
that seem a tad excessive. "You are disgusting," he says to Judge
Blount at the dinner table, though Judge Blount doesn't seem
especially disgusting. Ruth tells Martin, "You are unbearable." He
delivers gas-bag philosophical harangues, full of fury. Then his
anger takes another turn, and he drops into a black depression and
even delirium.</TE>
<TE>   Martin's delirium, which dominates the last portion of the book,
might seem hard to explain, if you looked for its causes only in
external events. But keep in mind the inner pressure that has been
pushing him forward. His bitterness and exhaustion are all too real.
Yet London makes us half suspect that Martin's collapse owes as well
to something else: to his amorous or sexual passions, not just to his
disappointments and fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   Martin's engagement to Ruth falls apart, and he takes up with a
working-class girlfriend, Lizzie, who adores him. "My God!" Lizzie
sobs, "I could die for you. I could die for you"--in another of the
several moments in this novel that seem to have dropped onto the page
from lived experience.</TE>
<TE>   But Martin cannot respond to Lizzie, just as he cannot respond to
Ruth. Ideas of sexual purity, of chastity and cleanliness hold him
back. Those ideas are London's, too, and are bound to make us smile
today. (" 'You know what marriage means.' Ruth shuddered and clung
close to her mother.") And yet those ideas, in their Victorian
prissiness, express something genuine in Martin. Filth and impurity
do worry him. It is because, as he makes his way from one social
class to another, he begins to feel that he has become two men: a
wealthy Martin of the present, who is civilized and clean; and a
proletarian Martin of the past, who is a fistfighting barbarian. Each
Martin regards the other with revulsion.</TE>
<TE>   This feeling--a fear of being two instead of one, a horror at his
own skin--does seem to have been London's deepest note. Every page of
"The Call of the Wild" vibrates to that tone, every new adventure in
the history of Buck, the friendly California half-St. Bernard, who
discovers in himself the buried biological instincts of an Alaskan
wolf.</TE>
<TE>   Only, in "Martin Eden," London takes that same creepy and
uncomfortable two-ness and shows it to be, most of all, an
ambivalence about women. The civilized Martin of the present has his
eye out for a goddess, a divinity, someone to worship. But the
proletarian Martin of the past has known everything but goddesses:
factory girls, women of the cattle camps, cigarette-smokers and thus
downward to the repellent and the disgusting, the "gin-bloated hags
of the stews, and all the vast hell's following of harpies," "the
scum and slime of the human pit."</TE>
<TE>   And the two Martins, past and present, cannot square their
different attitudes. Lizzie tells him frankly, "Something's wrong
with your think-machine." But what is Martin to do? The muscular
dynamism that draws women to him is genuine, and so is his
ambivalence. He sinks into delirium and even into suicide because, in
his bitter exhaustion, the mixture of ambivalence and desire, dog and
wolf, becomes more than he can endure.</TE>
<TE>   The novel tells a story of education, and the story of education
ends up being, in its peculiar way, a story of desire. It is not
Barthes' courtly French tale of flirtation and seduction. It is a
story of emotional extravagances much too big and ungainly for
ordinary life. The passion for reading and study, the lust to conquer
books and to be conquered by them, the mania for ideas, the cerebral
passion that is more than cerebral--this turns out to be, like any
deeply muscular and emotional drive, fully capable of going wrong.</TE>
<TE>   London tells his story a little clumsily sometimes. So what? In
Martin, he created one of the great twisted heroes of American
literature, an "isolato" out of Melville (who is openly saluted),
brilliant, inflamed, self-destructive, manic, a hero doomed from the
outset because his own passions are bigger and more complicated than
any man could bear.</TE>

<DH>SANDY KOUFAX: A Lefty's Legacy, By Jane Leavy,
HarperCollins: 282 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>Walter Bernstein is a screenwriter and the author of
"Inside Out: A Memoir of the Blacklist."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It can be said that there was no better preparation for life's
vicissitudes than being a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers. After that, no
defeat was foreign to you. Hard knocks were not only expected but
welcomed; it was how you knew you were alive. What would be tragedy
to a Yankee fan was risible to us, mere lagniappe.</LD>
<LD>   As a boy, I would gather with my friends outside the right field
fence of Ebbets Field, waiting for a homerun ball to fly over so that
we could give chase as it rolled merrily down the street. But when
the Dodgers were up--we could just see home plate through a tiny
space where the fence didn't quite touch the ground--we sat back
against the fence and rested. The Dodgers didn't hit home runs; they
were lucky to hit the ball out of the infield.</LD>
<LD>   But a true fan is forever, and we remained loyal even during the
later years when the Dodgers became winners. By then, our lives had
been set. A scarred psyche could handle the fact that this team was
not the team we had once loved. This team offered a sunny
post-Depression view of life: Given talent, you could win. But, when
news filtered through the borough in the early '50s that the Dodgers
had acquired a local product, a fire-balling southpaw flinger
guaranteed to turn the league on its ear, we could temper our
rejoicing with the knowledge that he was also Jewish. Something bad
could always happen.</LD>
<TE>   The pitcher's name was Sandy Koufax, and he did indeed turn the
league on its ear. His life--at least his baseball life--has now been
told with a reverence bordering on idolatry by Jane Leavy, a former
sportswriter for the Washington Post. Still, there is a lot to be
reverential about. Leavy points out that for "five consecutive years,
from 1962 through 1966, Koufax led the National League in Earned Run
Average (he is the only pitcher to have done that). Four times he led
the National League in strikeouts. Three times, he won at least
twenty-five games. Ninety-seven times, he struck out ten or more
batters .... [In] his last year, pitching with a crippled, arthritic
arm, he won twenty-seven games and completed twenty-seven games. And
he never missed a start."</TE>
<TE>   The idea that any pitcher today might complete seven games, let
alone 27, is like thinking games might last less than three hours or
that hitters not be allowed to stroll around the stadium between
pitches, flexing their muscles. Koufax's record is a quaint reminder
of olden days when a pitcher who couldn't throw nine innings was
considered a sissy.</TE>
<TE>   Koufax was a marvel not because of the games he finished but how
he finished them. He had only two pitches, a fastball and a curve.
But as Willie Mays put it, "He threw them very well." It didn't
matter if the batter guessed which one was coming. According to
Willie Stargell, another mean hitter, "It was like trying to drink
coffee with a fork."</TE>
<TE>   Koufax also inspired a certain headiness of prose, and Leavy is
not immune to this. "They called it a yellow hammer. They called it a
biter and they called it a bitch. Mostly, they called it unfair. It
started a foot over your head and headed south in a hurry. Hitters
swore it broke two feet. From the letters to the knees. From the
table to the floor. From heaven to God's green earth. They said it
fell out of the sky."</TE>
<TE>   Koufax did not, however, start as a baseball player. At 6 feet, 2
inches tall with a tremendous vertical leap, his first love was
basketball. He was captain of the team at Lafayette High School in
the Bensonhurst part of Brooklyn, a middle-class, mostly Jewish and
Italian neighborhood. His compatriots grew up to be such disparate
luminaries as Larry King, Alan Dershowitz, Jerry Della Femina and
Vito Farinola, who became Vic Damone. The rising baseball star was
Fred Wilpon, Koufax's best friend. But Wilpon rose only to the
ownership of the Mets, a lesser stardom.</TE>
<TE>   Koufax's ambition was to play for the New York Knicks. Once, his
high school team practiced against some of the Knicks' players, and
Koufax dunked over Harry Gallatin, a premium pro. The next time he
tried it, Gallatin and Al McGuire leveled him. He never did get to
the Knicks. He went on to the University of Cincinnati and, on a
school trip to New Orleans, the baseball team found it lacked
players. Koufax had played some sandlot baseball and offered to
pitch. That was it for basketball.</TE>
<TE>   He pitched only one season of college ball, going 3 and 1 with a
2.81 ERA. But word had gotten out; there was this kid who threw very,
very hard. Major league scouts began coming around and there were
tryouts for the Giants and the Pirates. The Yankees, as Leavy says,
"with their customary ethnic sensitivity, sent a Jewish scout to
court him, offending his family." Al Campanis, working for the
Dodgers, got Koufax a tryout at Ebbets Field. Rube Walker caught him
and afterward said, "Whatever he wants, give it to him. I wouldn't
let him out of the clubhouse."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers signed him for a first-year salary of $6,000 and a
$14,000 bonus. Under the league bonus rule, they had to keep Koufax
on the roster for at least three years, so to make room, they sent
another pitcher, Tommy Lasorda, to the minors. Leavy feels Lasorda is
still sore about this. The rest of the team was not exactly welcoming
either. They were battling for a pennant and would have preferred a
pitcher who could get the ball over the plate once in a while.</TE>
<TE>   And there was the ever-present anti-Semitism to go along with
baseball's pervasive racism. The black players befriended him; it was
a time, as Leavy says, "when blacks and Jews could still identify
with each other as persecuted minorities." He was especially
protected by Don Newcombe and Joe Black. Black was the pitcher who in
one game put a definitive stop to the racist taunting he was getting
from the opposing team. He simply fired his fast ball into their
dugout. He claimed he wasn't trying to hit anyone, and he didn't, but
the taunting stopped after that. "They hated Jews as much as they
hated blacks," Newcombe said. "I don't know if Sandy ever knew that,
but that's why we took care of Sandy."</TE>
<TE>   It was not easy to figure out what Koufax knew or didn't know. He
was a loner and kept his thoughts mostly to himself. But during
spring training in Florida, he would visit the black players at their
segregated hotel and pal around with them. He was a liberal who had
not yet learned to regard his liberalism as self-hate. His idol was
his grandfather, a socialist. The first few professional years, he
was inconsistent but brilliant. He was like the girl with the curl in
the middle of her forehead. When he could locate the plate, he was
unhittable.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1957, stricken with greed, Walter O'Malley moved the
Dodgers to Los Angeles. The city had given him 315 acres and a
promise to evict the families, mostly Mexican American, who lived on
them. A great new stadium would be built with all the amenities,
although without water fountains so that the fans would have to spend
money to quench their thirst. It was the year of the Great Betrayal.
Brooklyn mourned, but Koufax flourished. He had learned to pitch.</TE>
<TE>   His career after that was consistently brilliant. "For the last
five years of his career, Koufax was unassailable. He led the majors
in every pitching category ... [and was] named Pitcher of the
Decade." His teammate, Don Drysdale, another overpowering pitcher,
said, "He's the only pitcher I've ever seen [who], if he pitched a
no-hitter every time, I wouldn't be a bit surprised." Then his arm
went bad. The trainers said it was because of his unusual build, his
"extreme" muscles; he had traumatic arthritis. Before each start,
they would work on him for an hour and a half. They rubbed his arm
with Capsolin, a salve derived from chili peppers so hot that the
trainers wore rubber gloves and ladled it on with tongue depressors.
After a game, Koufax's arm would swell up and sometimes hemorrhage
and turn black. But he never missed a start. It is a statement to
carve on the tombstones of crippled ballplayers. He lived up to the
tradition: He was a gamer; he played with pain. Until finally he had
to quit.</TE>
<TE>   Leavy tells the story well, alternating biographical chapters with
an inning-by-inning account of a perfect game he pitched against the
Chicago Cubs. But her Koufax is pretty much perfection all around. If
you pricked him, there is an even chance he wouldn't bleed. He has no
discernible flaws; everyone speaks well of him. It all seems deserved
but makes the book monochromatic. Koufax agreed to her interviewing
him "so long as it is clear the book is based on what others said,
not on what I'm saying." She agreed not to interview his closest
relatives and "chose not to call his ex-wives, ex-girlfriends or the
woman with whom he currently shares his life. You don't need to know
everything to write the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but if you want to know the man whose biography you are
writing, it's nice to know a bit more than this. Leavy has written a
very good and meaningful book about baseball. She knows the game, and
she is acute in placing it in its social context. She writes
gracefully and with feeling. Koufax obviously means a great deal to
her--as a man, as a pitcher and as the Jewish player who refused to
pitch on Yom Kippur. Within the restrictions she's imposed on
herself, she makes him interesting and believable. But it is not
necessarily prurience that would like a little more from those wives
and girlfriends.</TE>

<LD>Philip Larkin, who spent nearly all his life in northeastern England,
chafed at the idea that place could have anything to do with poetry.
In "I Remember, I Remember," the very antithesis of the regional
poem, the speaker is traveling on a train that passes through
Coventry, the town where he (like Larkin) grew up. First he does not
recognize it, then he recounts a litany of experiences he never had
there: childhood games unplayed, romances unconsummated, poetry
unpublished. " 'Oh well, / I suppose it's not the place's fault,' I
said. / 'Nothing, like something, happens anywhere.' "</LD>
<LD>   But what if it is "the place's fault"? Nothing may happen
anywhere, but everything must happen somewhere. That is the premise
of "Poems of the American West" and "Poems of New York," two new
entries in the Everyman's Library Pocket Poets series. Both
anthologies make a case--if at times an uncertain one--for the idea
that a place does leave a profound impression on the poetry that it
produces. It is implicit even in their minimalist titles: These are
poems not about places but of them.</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, there is something unavoidably reductionist about
categorizing poetry in terms of setting. Even poems that seem to be
explicitly centered in a certain location--Wordsworth's "Tintern
Abbey," Arnold's "Dover Beach"--use location only as a launching pad
for a larger meditation. The best poems are not New York poems or
Paris poems or Djibouti poems--they are simply poems. "The Waste
Land" would look ludicrous in an anthology of "Poems of London."</TE>
<TE>   But if place is not always a useful way of thinking about poetry,
poetry can be a useful way of thinking about place. The poems in both
books are not so much about physical regions as states of mind. The
images that serve to locate so much of the poetry--the arroyos and
the saguaros, the Horn &amp; Hardart and the World Trade Center--are
elements of an elaborately constructed, long-enduring national
mythology that has its roots in art itself: movies, television,
photography and also poetry.</TE>
<TE>   A poem that we call a "Western poem" or a "New York poem" is one
that corresponds with the mental images and emotional expectations
that we already carry within us. And, bringing their readers full
circle, the poems in these books recapitulate these national symbols,
creating them anew for another generation of readers.</TE>
<TE>   New York is the epicenter of American mythologizing, partly
because at any given moment it holds the country's highest
concentration of poets. "Poems of New York," edited by Elizabeth
Schmidt, is remarkable for the sheer number of the greatest American
writers that it includes: Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams,
Marianne Moore, Dorothy Parker, Hart Crane, Elizabeth Bishop. Some of
these poets are commonly associated with New York, but some are
not--Wallace Stevens' "Arrival at the Waldorf" is an unexpected
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Other poems have taken on such a universal connotation that their
particularization is a shock: the ferry in Edna St. Vincent Millay's
sentimental anthem "Recuerdo" ("We were very tired, we were very
merry--/ we had gone back and forth all night on the ferry") turns
out to be the Staten Island Ferry. Langston Hughes' most famous poem
is more commonly known by its first line, "What happens to a dream
deferred?," but its title, we are reminded, is actually "Harlem."</TE>
<TE>   If many of these poems have become landmarks more of particular
movements--the Jazz Age, the Harlem Renaissance, the Beats--than of
the city itself, others are New York poems to the core. Whitman's
"Mannahatta" rises out of the swirl of chaos at the city's beginning:</TE>
<TE>   I was asking for something specific and perfect for my city</TE>
<TE>   Whereupon lo! upsprang the aboriginal name.</TE>
<TE>   Now I see what there is in a name, a word, liquid, sane, unruly,
musical, self-sufficient,</TE>
<TE>   I see that the word of my city is that word from of old ....</TE>
<TE>   Moving toward the present, we see Sara Teasdale strolling around
Union Square, Allen Ginsberg gazing down from the top of the RCA
Building, Billy Collins bopping through Times Square listening to a
Walkman. The cacophony of voices on the pages of "Poems of New York"
is not unlike the jumble of sounds one hears walking down a New York
City street.</TE>
<TE>   New York's voices and cultures may seem infinite, but the West,
"containing worlds as different as Oregon is from New Mexico or
Montana from Southern California, ... is almost as hard to see as
America itself," Robert Mezey writes in his introduction to "Poems of
the American West." He has tried valiantly to include as many of
these different perspectives as possible: Bertolt Brecht on
Hollywood, Janet Lewis on the redwood forest, Yvor Winters on
Wyoming, J.V. Cunningham on Montana, Weldon Kees on Salt Lake City,
William Stafford on San Francisco--plus Chippewa and Pawnee tribal
songs, folk songs about Jesse James, country music lyrics by Randy
Travis and a little cowboy poetry to boot.</TE>
<TE>   This all makes for an amorphous anthology. Part of the problem is
that the book defines the West quite broadly; it's hard to see for
instance why Arkansas merits inclusion. Mezey seems to be guided more
by the artbitrary boundary of the Mississippi than by any conceptual
sense of the West as a region in its own right. Moreover, for all its
inclusiveness, "Poems of the American West" has a surprisingly
homogenous feel. With the exception of the folk songs and the Indian
lyrics, the book is largely restricted to the 20th century, and to
male writers.</TE>
<TE>   A greater problem is that while the book comprises many fine
poems, the general level of the poetry is not up to the high standard
of "Poems of New York." Perhaps the West more inherently lends itself
to cliche, but one can read only so many references to creosote
without suspecting that their  only function is to lend a little
local color to the poems. And some of Mezey's choices seem simply
wrong. What is Robert Frost's "The Gift Outright" doing here? Aside
from one line about "the land vaguely realizing westward," both its
cadences and its subject root this poem in New England:</TE>
<TE>   The land was ours before we were the land's.</TE>
<TE>   She was our land more than a hundred years</TE>
<TE>   Before we were her people. She was ours</TE>
<TE>   In Massachusetts, in Virginia,</TE>
<TE>   But we were England's, still colonials,</TE>
<TE>   Possessing what we still were unpossessed by,</TE>
<TE>   Possessed by what we now no more possessed ....</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Witter Bynner's "Defeat," which describes German
soldiers traveling by train through Texas, reflects back on the North
and the South during the Civil War but has nothing to do with the
West. Worse, it takes the antiwar polemic to a ridiculous extreme.</TE>
<TE>   Organization is a crucial factor in any anthology, but this series
does not allow its editors much leeway. Both books are arranged
chronologically by the poets' dates of birth, which is both a
difficulty--the dates of composition might have been noted
somewhere--and an unexpected boon. In "Poems of New York," the
juxtaposition of poems about the attack on the World Trade Center
with works written years earlier by poets of the same generation is
both jarring and stunning. One page has Wislawa Szymborska's somber
"Photograph from September 11" ("They jumped from the burning
floors--/ one, two, a few more / higher, lower") facing Kenneth
Koch's exuberant "Girl and Baby Florist Sidewalk Pram Nineteen
Seventy Something:"</TE>
<TE>   Sweeping past the florist's came the baby and the girl</TE>
<TE>   I am the girl! I am the baby!</TE>
<TE>   I am the florist who is filled with mood!</TE>
<TE>   I am the mood....</TE>
<TE>   Such contrasts serve as a reminder that Sept. 11 will eventually
be integrated into the cultural and artistic history of New York, an
indelible part of the city's identity.</TE>
<TE>   Fortuitously, the final poem in each volume, by each book's
youngest poet, is one of the loveliest. Nathaniel Bellows' "Liberty
Island" celebrates a love affair as fresh as spring:</TE>
<TE>   In the park with its view of Liberty Island I sit by the freshly
planted</TE>
<TE>   bed, the bulb's results lolling--fluted flowers in a neat line</TE>
<TE>   pale-yellow and white. Everyone stops to watch them nod</TE>
<TE>   in the new spring air. Today the trees are dressed, filled with
fronds,</TE>
<TE>   the water is glass all around us.</TE>
<TE>   "Days of Summer Gone," by Joe Bolton, elegizes a romance past:</TE>
<TE>   But it's raining tonight</TE>
<TE>   In Houston, Texas, and how is your weather</TE>
<TE>   In Berkeley? What happened to us?</TE>
<TE>   Westward is the world's motion, and time's,</TE>
<TE>   If not memory's.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, neither of these poems is about place at all. Some
things really do happen anywhere.</TE>

<HD>The Man in the White Coat</HD>
<DH>RISING TO THE LIGHT: A Portrait of Bruno Bettelheim, By
Theron Raines, Alfred A. Knopf: 520 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CELESTE FREMON</AU>
<BD>Celeste Fremon is the author of "Father Greg &amp; the
Homeboys: The Extraordinary Journey of Father Greg Boyle and His Work
With the Latino Gangs of East L.A."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the famed psychologist and writer Bruno Bettelheim was found
dead on the floor of his new apartment in a Maryland nursing home on
March 13, 1990, a plastic bag over his head and barbiturates in his
bloodstream, the psychological community reeled.</LD>
<LD>   "Bettelheim would often use what he called 'The Man in the White
Coat Theory,' " commented a distressed colleague. "He said that in
addition to honesty, there has to be a quality of 'The Man in the
White Coat' in your professional presentation, the image of the
magical ability to heal. Well, certainly, 'The Man in the White Coat'
doesn't kill himself."</LD>
<LD>   At the time of his death at 86, Bettelheim was considered that
rarest of creatures: a populist intellectual. He had published 18
books, including the National Book Award winner "The Uses of
Enchantment," and written scores of magazine articles. In addition,
for more than 25 years, he had run the University of Chicago's
Orthogenic School and, in so doing, pioneered a new type of
enlightened and humane residential therapy to treat emotionally
disturbed children, most of whom had previously been little more than
warehoused.</LD>
<TE>   Bettelheim had the intellectual heft to argue that Freud's central
concepts had been grossly mistranslated (most notably in "Freud and
Man's Soul") while writing a monthly column on parenting for Ladies'
Home Journal. A survivor of two Nazi concentration camps (Dachau and
Buchenwald), he became a noted theorist on Holocaust issues, and his
published ideas about women presaged Betty Friedan's. By 1983,
Bettelheim was so recognizable a figure that he played himself in
Woody Allen's film "Zelig."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, within a few months of his suicide, Bettelheim's white coat
was in tatters and his previously stellar reputation was plummeting
at neck-snapping speed as former students from the Orthogenic School
came forward with accusations that the saintly Dr. B was in reality
an autocratic tyrant who hit and otherwise terrified patients and
staff.</TE>
<TE>   These unpleasant revelations were followed by news that, when
Bettelheim arrived in the United States after his release from the
camps, he fabricated much of his curriculum vitae. There were also
grim mentions in academic journals suggesting that he'd cribbed
certain ideas in his much lauded "The Uses of Enchantment." A thinly
disguised Bettelheim was even featured as a fictional archvillain by
psychologist-turned-crime writer Jonathan Kellerman in his 1994
whodunit, "Bad Love."</TE>
<TE>   "Hero or Humbug?" shouted the headline of a Bettelheim-related
article in a 1997 issue of Time magazine. That same year, two major
biographies of Bettelheim appeared in stores, each strenuously
researched, each purporting to set the record straight. The first,
"Bettelheim: A Life and a Legacy" by Anglo-French journalist Nina
Sutton, was essentially approving; the second, "The Creation of Dr.
B," by former Nation editor Richard Pollak (whose brother had
attended the Orthogenic School), was an excoriating j'accuse. Now
there is a third book, "Rising to the Light: A Portrait of Bruno
Bettelheim," by his longtime agent and friend Theron Raines.</TE>
<TE>   I approached the Raines book with some trepidation because I had
interviewed Bettelheim on three occasions before his death, at which
times he talked extensively, even obsessively, about whether he
intended to kill himself. Because of the unusual nature of our
conversations, I was contacted by his three would-be biographers, and
they all tipped their hands about the slants they intended to take.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Raines sounded the most muddled. He admitted he was
close to Bettelheim and felt for the man a deep, almost reverent,
affection, thus was unwilling to give succor to his critics. Yet, he
also understood that an admiring apologia for a man whose reputation
was so grime-spattered as Bettelheim's would not be viewed charitably
by readers or reviewers. After a decade-long wrestling match with his
material, Raines settled on a third route. The result is likely to be
categorized as yet another Bettelheim biography. But it isn't.</TE>
<TE>   While Sutton and Pollak aimed to assess Bettelheim's life and work
(albeit from radically opposed positions), Raines attempts to give a
picture of what it was like to be Bettelheim. The project was
conceived in 1983 as a long magazine article written largely in
Bettelheim's own voice, with Raines acting as a sort of midwife.
(Evidently, despite Raines' pleading, Bettelheim had for years
declined to write an autobiography.) To give the piece some balance,
Raines began talking to friends and colleagues; soon the material
overflowed its bounds and Raines realized he was writing a book, not
an article.</TE>
<TE>   But what kind of book? After Bettelheim's suicide and the ensuing
scandals, a simple presentation of the Great Man's words was no
longer tenable. In the end, Raines circled around to a far more
rigorous version of the project than he originally envisioned. "I
have not set out to answer Bettelheim's army of critics ...," he
writes, "nor do I expect to decrease their number."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Raines paints a subjective but convincing portrait of the
man he knew for 20 years and got to know better posthumously through
his dogged pursuit of Bettelheim's methods and motives. Raines'
Bettelheim is a passionate, brilliant yet complicated creature,
permanently wounded by various events in his life, whose capacious
and original mind allowed him to use his wounds--and the wounds he
perceived in others--as launching pads for deeper consideration of
the meaning and purpose behind human behavior.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to areas of contention, rather than argue with
Pollak and his fellow detractors, Raines simply burrows more deeply
into Bettelheim's version of events, ostensibly in search of a fuller
truth. As it turns out, this is a surprisingly interesting strategy.
Though one may or may not always agree with Bettelheim's choices, one
often comes away comprehending the meticulous logic that led him to
make them.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the most difficult issues to penetrate have to do with
Bettelheim's actions at the Orthogenic School. Yet even here Raines
provokes thought and insight. He also places Bettelheim's theories
within the context of the beliefs prevalent during the years he began
his work at the school: The rest of the nation's psychiatric experts
thought it best to shock or tranquilize disturbed children, while
Bettelheim believed in a residential environment that was universally
nurturing and encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   Bettelheim also believed that an autocratic parental figure
(separate from the all-accepting counselors) was needed to provide an
appropriate "superego" structure until the child could develop one of
his or her own. That harsh father was Bettelheim. "I was always
called in when things got out of hand," he told Raines, "to settle
the issue. This is part of the father role, you know. I think in a
way they were afraid of me, and it served a useful purpose. Why?
Because it kept their disintegrating tendencies in balance ...."</TE>
<TE>   Only in the case of what Raines calls "the plagiarism slander"
does he take a run at Bettelheim's critics head-on. In doing so, he
manages to convincingly demonstrate that the short, non-seminal
passages--lifted without attribution from writer and psychiatrist
Julius Heuscher--add up to, at worst, some brief moments in sloppy
scholarship. (Raines further suggests that the condemnatory cries
from various mainstream media were the result of much sloppier source
checking.) To hammer home his point, Raines tracks down Heuscher, the
allegedly wronged party, who waves away the plagiarism notion. "I
think it's ridiculous to make a thing about this," says Heuscher.</TE>
<TE>   In the natural course of his narrative, Raines touches on some of
the controversies that Bettelheim seemed to attract--despite his
popularity--throughout much of his career. In many of these cases,
the arguments seemed to be less with Bettelheim than with
misinterpretations of his ideas by book reviewers and academics. For
example, after the 1954 publication of "Symbolic Wounds," he was
repeatedly criticized for comparing children and psychotics to
preliterate tribes, whereas Raines uses Bettelheim's own text to show
that the author pointed instead to a common humanity. "Far from
wishing to draw parallels between primitive man and schizophrenic
youngsters," Bettelheim wrote, "I tried to show how parallel are the
primitive wishes of all men. [For example] ... I believe puberty
rites to refer to something so primitive that we all share in it."
(These same ideas were enthusiastically embraced a few years later by
such popular authors as Joseph Campbell and Robert Bly.)</TE>
<TE>   By elucidating Bettelheim's insights on a variety of topics,
Raines reminds us that behind whatever clouds of scandal there may be
lies a profound body of work, much of which still has the power to
touch and inform us today, if we will only take the time to examine
it more closely.</TE>
<TE>   When I finished Raines' book, on a whim I fished out the old
transcripts from my conversations with Bettelheim. Glancing through
the pages I was able to hear in my mind's ear his heavily accented
voice, so full of intelligence, humor, eloquence, sadness. I
remembered how much I'd liked him. Then my gaze landed on something
he said on the last day we talked. I'd just asked him if there was
anything he felt he'd left undone.</TE>
<TE>   I recall he smiled at the question. "I guess many things. There's
so much to know. And so little time, really. My goal was to say what
I wanted to say as well as I could. And make it relatively easy to
understand. I tried to write clearly. I don't know if I succeeded,
but I tried."</TE>
<TE>   Interesting, I thought. At the end of his life, Bettelheim didn't
wish for recognition. Or agreement. Or even success in his role as a
healer. Only the goal of clarity and understanding. This is also
Raines' goal: clarity and understanding. For Bettelheim. And,
perhaps, for all of us.</TE>

<LD>I first read "Invisible Man" when I lived not far from where its
author wrote it, while discovering how I, too, could be invisible. I
had moved to Harlem with a friend in 1985. We were practically the
only whites in that part of town and the first to live on our block.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't remember the last time your kind of people moved in
here," an elderly resident admitted. After some surrounding dismay
and amusement ("Well, there goes the neighborhood," our next-door
neighbor sighed to her husband), we did make friends; perhaps
inevitably, we were also harassed by members of a nearby Nation of
Islam mosque. But the majority of Harlemites responded to their new
white neighbors in a way I hadn't expected: They looked away when we
passed, didn't answer when we said "Hello" or "Excuse me," walked
around us at the supermarket as though they had simply erased us from
sight.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't long after moving to Harlem that I stumbled onto
"Invisible Man," which is now 50 years old and is being commemorated
by a reissue of the original edition and a documentary devoted to its
author, Ralph Ellison, which aired earlier this year on PBS'
"American Masters" series. Although I knew of Ellison and his book,
teachers and friends urged me not to read him when I discovered
African American fiction; so it wasn't until I picked up a copy of
"Invisible Man" at our local library that I fell under its startling,
almost unnerving spell.</TE>
<TE>   The novel is the confession--"confession" as St. Augustine used
it: a factual and spiritual autobiography--of a narrator who is never
called by nor tells us his name (I came to call him "Invisible").
Self-sequestered in a sub-basement somewhere on the outskirts of
Harlem, Invisible writes a kind of anti-bildungsroman. Expelled from
a prestigious black school for innocently allowing a white benefactor
to learn more about the ignoble suffering racism brings to black life
than the college's president deems beneficial, the narrator makes his
way to New York in hopes of reversing his fall from favor. Then
through a series of comical, harrowing, even fantastic experiences,
he discovers a world so betrayed by fear, hatred and absurdity that
his black identity makes it impossible for anyone to see or
understand him. Once full of hopes for a brilliant future, Ellison's
narrator ends up living underground in the invisibility of truth,
using his words rather than his presence to reach a world unable to
recognize him.</TE>
<TE>   Walking to and from the library from which I had borrowed
"Invisible Man," I often saw an old gentleman who sat on a nearby
park bench. We never spoke, but he almost always gave me a friendly
nod, sometimes noticing the pile of books under my arm with an amused
expression. Then one day in 1994, I opened the New York Times and,
accompanying an article about Ellison (who had recently died), I saw
a photo of the man I had passed again and again on my way home.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time I had been obsessed by Invisible's travails, even
trying to track down where he fell into a manhole and disappeared.
Later, as I studied Ellison's novel and life, I understood better the
reasons for my own invisibility: Differences--racial, sexual,
economic and religious--challenge Americans and perpetuate their
inability to recognize one another as fellows entangled by history,
language, hopes, hatreds and dreams. A look at the book's reception,
from the year it was published in 1952, shows how many people, in
refusing to acknowledge this behavior, unwittingly act it out.</TE>
<TE>   Ellison's work attained almost instant "classic" status. It was
avidly praised and discussed by a large circle of critics and
readers. More than 10 years after its publication, Book Week magazine
in 1965 polled literary critics to select the greatest American novel
written after World War II; the novel was their choice. But over
time, "Invisible Man" lost much of its audience. The activism of the
civil rights era, which drew fire from the book's themes, dissipated
in the late 1960s, as nationalist and separatist agendas gained
popularity in black communities. The banner of Black Power was picked
up by the Black Arts Movement, which emphasized creativity in the
service of political agendas and suspected older artists.</TE>
<TE>   Ellison and "Invisible Man" were subject to intense suspicion. His
novel was denounced as a betrayal of black life, an attempt to win
favor among whites, and its author was heckled during personal
appearances. These often shallow and self-righteous misreadings of
Ellison endure. (Even in the PBS Ellison documentary, Amiri Baraka, a
fervent "Invisible" antagonist, can be seen shaking his head sadly
over Ellison.)</TE>
<TE>   As Lawrence Jackson details in his discerning, thorough and much
needed biography, "Ralph Ellison: Emergence of Genius" (which
concludes, as the subtitle suggests, with the author's acceptance of
the 1953 National Book Award for "Invisible Man"), history and
temperament rendered Ellison an unlikely champion of his own beliefs.
He grew up in Oklahoma, where segregation had existed for only a few
decades (and slavery never) and where Ellison witnessed acts of
resistance: political, communal and personal.</TE>
<TE>   Later experiences widened and deepened his sense of racism as a
collective malaise, one that causes people to mistake and misuse one
another. Just as "Moby-Dick" emerged in part from Herman Melville's
collision with the world of literature he explored as avidly as he
did the seas, so Ellison's "Invisible Man" emerged as his passion for
music, folklore and early American fiction collided with the
Modernist authors he discovered in his 20s (his novel bears epigraphs
by Melville and T.S. Eliot). In "Invisible Man," Ellison depicted
"race" with a complexity and versatility far beyond previous (and
many succeeding) novels on the subject, making it a more powerful and
demanding experience than almost any other in American literature.</TE>
<TE>   But "Invisible Man" remains our literature's invisible classic,
awarded honor without profit, cited but unread (or read
inadequately). In high school and college, Ellison is infrequently
assigned; as an African American novelist, Toni Morrison clearly
outpolls him. When I worked in a bookstore, I routinely asked
graduate students bearing reading lists what they were studying; even
African American studies majors seldom mentioned (or read) Ellison.
Author and novel have gained recent defenders, but many Ellison
champions tend to be either political conservatives who
sentimentalize the novel's message into a we-are-all-brothers
coziness or black males who wield Ellison as a weapon against other
black writers (especially Morrison)--or both.</TE>
<TE>   Rereading it today, one can only wonder at this novel's being
pilloried. How could a book that states, "Whence all this passion
toward conformity anyway?--diversity is the word" be accused of
conservatism? Where is the Uncle Tom-ism in a novel that renders the
permutations of prejudice so authentically that it still bears the
power to shock, insult and alienate readers of all kinds, that it
indicts its readers in a way no "oppressed" writing ever could?</TE>
<TE>   "Invisible Man's" famous last line, "Who knows but that, on the
lower frequencies, I speak for you?" has been cited as a statement of
racial unity--but its Poe-like eeriness shouldn't be unheard (even
though the narrator implicitly rejects such a comparison: "I am an
invisible man," the novel begins. "No, I am not a spook like those
who haunted Edgar Allan Poe.... "). Nor should the sentence that
precedes the novel's final words: "And it is this which frightens
me." Could it be that Invisible's testimony is so true a reflection
of how we continue to live in "[this] simple yet confoundingly
complex arrangement of hope and desire, fear and hate" that our own
responses to it frequently replicate Ellison's illumination of our
society's desperate dependency on the decision not to see?</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years on, "Invisible Man's" readers remain so used to that
blindness that we continually self-aggrandize it into new functions.
(In this light, Morrison's insistence on her fiction not being
compared to the older, whiter, male literary canon becomes less
liberating and more troubling.) It is just one irony of Ellison's
life and work that critics who deplored him often became part of a
movement called "identity politics," placing premium importance on
"visibility."</TE>
<TE>   And yet whether we recognize him or not, Ellison's fictional
conscience hovers just beyond our sight, his awakening still too
demanding a revelation for many readers. A great work of art can
expose its audience to aspects of its existence beyond the reach of
politicians, therapists and activists. Many of us remain prisoners of
agendas and histories we find difficult to understand or surmount.
But Ellison demonstrates how such obstacles can be confronted through
the integrity of fiction. If he cannot exist in his own world,
Invisible migrates from the middle passage of oppression to the
emancipation of our collective imagination; his story challenges the
stories we live by and share. The narrator's non-emergence at the end
is often puzzled over, but it is clear that in keeping his hero
underground, Ellison is throwing a dare at us. Invisible cannot
appear, after all, because he is only a creation: It is
we--Ellison-Invisible's readers--who can learn to witness each other.</TE>
<TE>   When I walk around Harlem now (where I no longer live), I can
still be startled by a sigh from a smoking manhole or attracted to an
electrical hum pulsing from a back alley filled with barred basement
entrances, Invisible's liberating cell still haunting me. I guess
this is the highest compliment I could pay Ellison: I want to believe
the unprecdented consciousness he wrested into American literature
from his own life and wounds truly lives, so I can search for him and
find him and discover if he and I could see one another</TE>

<AU>DANIEL HALPERN</AU>
<BD>Daniel Halpern is editorial director of Ecco, an
imprint of HarperCollins, and the co-founder and editor of Antaeus.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an editor, I know that every now and again a book will come in
that I am going to buy whatever it takes, because that's why I'm an
editor: to publish and share with others those books I can't live
without, books that justify, in my case, 30 years in publishing.</LD>
<LD>   I received "Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner" on a coolish day
in mid-October 1999, a first collection of short stories by an
unknown boxing "corner man" born in Long Beach and raised in Gardena,
closing in on his 72th birthday. I took the manuscript with me on my
two-hour commute from New York to my home in Princeton, N.J., late
that day, and by the time I reached Newark, the first stop, I knew
this was such a book. I pulled out my Nokia and called Nat Sobel, the
author's agent, and made my offer. A brief but passionate book
auction ensued, and by the time I arrived home, Ecco had the
collection.</LD>
<LD>   Its author was a man known as F.X. Toole. F.X. died earlier this
month of complications following heart surgery. At 70, F.X. had
written his first book, not that he hadn't been writing for the last
40 years. His was a good it's-never-too-late story about a man who
lived to write (among other things), far beyond the world of reward.
And what a collection of stories it is, less about boxing than about
lives lived on the edge, the edge he chose to tread.</LD>
<TE>   His son Gannon called me to tell me his dad had died. It was hard
to believe. I thought F.X. would live another 20 years, so tough a
guy was he in so many ways. F.X. wasn't even his real name (he
thought it would embarass his boxers to know their trainer wrote
books), but it's what the reading world knows him by, and it was who
he was to me. I could tell you his real name now--because it doesn't
matter anymore--but I guess I'm not going to because he'd fire me
(from heaven) as his friend and editor if I did. F.X. was unbending
when it came to issues such as trust and loyalty. He's what my
grandmother Sadie called "one of ours," by which she meant a man who
lived by the law he laid down for himself.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, F.X. was an unusually unyielding author, friend and
presence in the world. Every word he placed on the page mattered to
him, and its loss (as in an editorial "delete") could send him into a
rage, but his sense of humor was winning, if expensive: A pugilist at
heart, he was quick to strike out at anything that might get in his
way. Once, when he was on tour for Ecco, his plane to San Francisco
was delayed because of weather. He called me at midnight, East Coast
time, to let me know that the penalty for such a delay (wasn't this
an act of God, even for an Irish Catholic?) was a new leather jacket,
purchased, at our expense, on Market Street.</TE>
<TE>   His stories leave you a different person, especially (not
ironically) if you don't care about boxing, because this man's life
was a life of the soul, and he lived it, not to be repetitive, on the
edge. Here's a brief observation of his: "When I'm writing, I can get
blown up, blown up to the ceiling. The muse taps you on the shoulder
and it's love at first sight; if you don't follow, you look at
yourself like a punk." In the few years that I had the good fortune
of knowing him, he never punked, nor pulled a punch.</TE>
<TE>   F.X. was a remarkable man and an amazing writer. If you weren't
blessed with his acquaintance, you are blessed with the stories he
left for you (see "The Monkey Look" or "Million $$$ Baby"), which
invoke the life he led and believed in, which he most dearly wanted
to share with you, his new, if lately found, readers.</TE>

<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of "The Woman Who Laughed at God: The Untold
History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the countless monuments scattered throughout the District of
Columbia, perhaps the most obscure is a modest stone pillar known as
the Zero Milestone. To this day, it is the point from which highway
distances from Washington, D.C., are measured. But on the day it was
unveiled--July 7, 1919--the United States did not have a highway
system, and a journey by car across the continent to California was
still an ordeal.</LD>
<LD>   "[W]hen the car appeared," writes Pete Davies in "American Road:
The Story of an Epic Transcontinental Journey at the Dawn of the
Motor Age," an agreeable and accomplished blend of history, nostalgia
and armchair adventure, "there was nothing for it to drive on." On
that day in 1919, the U.S. War Department dispatched a convoy of 81
military vehicles on a trek from Washington to San Francisco--an
audacious and elaborate undertaking styled as the "first
transcontinental motor convoy." Given the lack of roads and roadside
services, the convoy included two tanker trucks carrying gasoline,
two mobile machine shops, several cargo trucks loaded with spare
parts and a monstrous contraption called the Militor that was
specially designed to haul "a lamed or stranded vehicle out of
trouble."</LD>
<TE>   Among the 37 officers and 258 enlisted men in the convoy was a
28-year-old lieutenant colonel named Dwight D. Eisenhower. He had not
managed to reach the fighting front in World War I, as Davies points
out, and the desk-bound career officer was hoping that a trek across
the continent would be an adventure. But the key man was Henry C.
Ostermann, a civilian who headed the convoy in "a gleaming white
Packard Twin Six--America's answer to the Rolls-Royce."</TE>
<TE>   Ostermann possessed a crucial skill that most Americans and all of
the officers and soldiers lacked. "[H]e had driven from coast to
coast across America no less than nineteen times," explains Davies.
"Or, to put it another way, Ostermann was driving the pilot car
because he was the only man who knew the way."</TE>
<TE>   "American Road" makes the point that Americans had fallen deeply
in love with the automobile by 1919, and they were clamoring for the
opportunity to hit the road. Some 6.5 million vehicles, manufactured
by 550 companies, were crowding the roadways of America, such as they
were. Members of the so-called Good Roads Movement--a coalition of
automobile enthusiasts and the automobile industry--were lobbying for
the completion of a transcontinental route comprising a number of
roads, called "the Lincoln Highway," which was being built in fits
and starts across the continent.</TE>
<TE>   "[I]t is not the work of a year; it is not the work even of a
decade," declared one of the early highway boosters. "It is the work
of a generation."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Army saw the strategic value of a national road system.
"As a military necessity, the Lincoln Highway should be constructed
so that the heaviest artillery could be rushed from one coast to the
other," one officer had declared in 1915, when the Army still relied
on mules and wagons. The first motorized units were organized by the
Army in 1916 to enable Gen. John Pershing to pursue Pancho Villa
after he raided a border town in New Mexico. By the summer of 1919,
only months after the end of World War I, the Army was eager to show
that it had learned the lessons of the world's first mechanized war.</TE>
<TE>   So the first transcontinental motor convoy was "one of the
greatest publicity stunts attempted in the history of the country,"
according to a newspaper in one of the towns along its route--and it
was a publicity stunt with more than one motive, as Davies shows us.
The Army sought to attract fresh recruits as well as funding for its
postwar operations, the Good Roads Movement hoped to draw support for
the Lincoln Highway, and the automobile industry was stoking the
appetites of American drivers for new and better places to drive
their cars.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Davies allows us to see the juggernaut at eye level
as it crossed the country's picturesque landscape, and he reminds us
of the brutal ambitions that the expedition symbolized. On the first
leg of the journey, for example, the convoy reached a covered bridge
in rural Pennsylvania that was too low and too frail for some of the
military trucks; the heavier vehicles were forced to ford the river,
and the roof of the bridge was hacked open to permit the higher
vehicles to cross.</TE>
<TE>   "These old wooden bridges are a thing of the past," carped one of
the officers to a local reporter, "and it wouldn't be a bad idea to
run over them and break them down to show how poorly they are
constructed."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 1, 1919, the convoy edged around Lake Tahoe and crossed
into California, a place that had created its own bureau of highways
as early as 1895 and passed its first state highway bond issue in
1910. "California had embraced road building with a fervor that went
far beyond the merely practical benefit of a decent highway,"
observes Davies. Five days later, the trucks were delivered by ferry
to the Embarcadero in San Francisco, where they were welcomed with a
ceremony that included the dedication of a second milestone, exactly
3,251 miles from the one in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Lincoln Highway is long gone, except for fragments,
and, outside of Davies' book, mostly forgotten. Much of its old route
was replaced by a later era of federal highways, including stretches
of U.S. 30: "The name Lincoln flickers alongside it--appended to a
retail court, a school, a body shop--like the distant memory of
another world, a world long ago bypassed," writes Davies. And the old
federal highways have been bypassed in turn by the interstate freeway
system that was launched during the Eisenhower administration, "the
biggest civil-engineering project in the history of the world." But
"American Road" shows that we live in precisely the world that the
boosters of the first transcontinental motor convoy so richly
imagined and so ardently desired.</TE>
<TE>   The Nogales Highway links two places with the same name, one in
Arizona and the other in Mexico. "Ambos Nogales"--literally, "both
Nogaleses"--is a study in words and images of the towns on each end
of the highway, the "nonidentical 'twin' towns joined and divided by
the border," as essayist Lawrence Taylor puts it.</TE>
<TE>   The prose in "Ambos Nogales" is intense and colorful; the
photographs by Maeve Hickey are mostly spare and monochromatic. But
they both conjure up a vivid sense of place, focusing far more on
Mexican Nogales than its American counterpart, and they both show the
endearing human face of a backwater that one expatriate dismisses as
"una caricatura de Mexico"--a caricature of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "Ambos Nogales" takes a more affirming and embracing view of "a
world in which human life is, paradoxically, at its most constrained
and most liberated." We meet "El Negro," the leader of a local gang
called Los Rolling Stones, and Blanca, a working mother who toils in
one of the foreign-owned assembly plants called maquiladoras; we see
a little boy wearing a castoff Donald Duck T-shirt with the legend
"Where's the Chicks?" and a slim young bullfighter in the traditional
garb of a toreador. And we encounter the so-called tunnel rats, the
children who live in the storm drains that run beneath the border
between Mexico and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "[E]verybody," says one of the citizens of the Mexican Nogales,
"has a right to his own craziness." But the authors of "Ambos
Nogales" see the same scene with considerably more compassion--"a
dramatic and endlessly surprising revelation of the human spirit."</TE>

<HD>How the Law Reflects the World We Create</HD>
<DH>AMERICAN LAW IN THE 20th CENTURY, By Lawrence M. Friedman,
Yale University Press: 722 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD LAZARUS</AU>
<BD>Edward Lazarus is the author of "Closed Chambers: The
Rise, Fall and Future of the Modern Supreme Court." He is a lawyer in
private practice.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took guts plain and simple for Lawrence M. Friedman to write
"American Law in the 20th Century." This is a topic of monumental
scope, encompassing revolutionary changes in every aspect of law,
from the rules regulating marriage to the basic structure of the U.S.
government. Fortunately for those who seek an enlightening guide to
this country's modern legal history, Friedman, a professor at
Stanford Law School, has erudition and style as well as guts. His
achievement is stunning and definitive.</LD>
<LD>   Friedman combines three talents, all essential to his enterprise
of describing the transformation of American law from a relatively
modest system for dispute resolution in the 19th century into the
judicial leviathan we live with today. He has an astonishing breadth
of knowledge, a gift for choosing historical exemplars and, most
important, a keen sense of the relationship between changes in our
legal culture and changes in society as a whole.</LD>
<LD>   The landscape of American law covers a complex and varied
topography. Any serious history of the subject must analyze federal
and state law, statutes and court-made law, civil and criminal law,
legal procedure and the laws themselves, law practice and its
teaching and the effect of our laws both at home and abroad.</LD>
<TE>   Given this challenge, Friedman could have been forgiven some
inconsistency. Yet whether the issue is the derivation of the term
"ambulance chaser" (plaintiff's lawyers had to be quick to the scene
of accidents to prevent insurance adjusters from convincing victims
to sign claims releases) or the inner workings of the U.S. Supreme
Court (where each justice acts not collegially but as a "separate
sovereignty"), Friedman seems equally at home.</TE>
<TE>   Each of Friedman's chapters is jampacked with information and
perspective. Say you're interested in the travails of US Airways or
WorldCom and want to know about bankruptcy law. True, you won't come
away from Friedman's five pages on the subject knowing how to file a
bankruptcy petition. But you will get an overview of the system,
including a history of Congress' loosening and tightening of the
requirements for bankruptcy and a thumbnail on how modern
corporations have filed for bankruptcy protection to get out of labor
contracts (Continental Airlines) or avoid massive tort liability
(Manville Corp., a main producer of asbestos). Most interesting,
Friedman has explained the vital role of bankruptcy law in fostering
a society of entrepreneurs by providing a legal safety net--in
essence a second chance--for the risk-takers who fuel the engine of
social innovation.</TE>
<TE>   Other keys to Friedman's success are his abilities to identify the
seminal case, the vital personae, the meaningful statistic, the
watershed moment and to accompany these choices with a lively and
insightful narrative description. Naturally, some selections are
pre-ordained. Every analysis of law in wartime is going to discuss
the Japanese internment cases, just as a section on product safety
must feature Ralph Nader and his crusades.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman's book, however, includes obscure surprises. Gabrielle
Darley is hardly a household name, but this prostitute-turned-society
wife pioneered the tort of invasion of privacy--a favorite legal
claim of celebrities--after her colorful life became the subject of
the 1925 movie, "The Red Kimono."</TE>
<TE>   And outside of the legal academy, not many people know Karl
Llewellyn, whom Friedman describes with a characteristic mix of fact
and judgment as "a man of extraordinary breadth and intelligence, an
amateur poet (and not half bad), a much-married man, a heavy drinker
(perhaps an alcoholic), and a distinguished professor of law, mostly
at Columbia, then in his later years at the University of Chicago."
In the 1940s, Llewellyn drafted the Uniform Commercial Code--a set of
rules that still governs the sale and delivery of goods between
merchants--and was a pioneer of the still-influential legal realist
movement, a loose collection of skeptics who exposed the political
roots of judicial decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   Admirably, Friedman never forgets that these characters and
stories that color our legal history--the giants like Oliver Wendell
Holmes, who dominated legal thinking for a generation, or a tragedy
like the Birmingham church bombing, which shamed a nation--are part
of a larger social context. Indeed, Friedman's greatest
accomplishment may well be that, despite his obvious passion for the
law, he repeatedly instructs (and illustrates) that the power of law
to change society is dwarfed by the power of society to change the
law.</TE>
<TE>   In this vein, Friedman ties many of the great transformations in
law during the last century to forces external to the law. For
example, one of the most dramatic changes of that period was the
exponential increase in the legal power wielded by the federal
government. The Supreme Court paved the way for this federalization
of the law when, in belated response to the Great Depression, it
changed its view of the Constitution to permit the federal government
to oversee a wide range of economic matters--such as wages and
hours--that previously had been considered an exclusively state or
local concern. Thus, the modern administrative state, with is vast
web of agencies and regulations, was born.</TE>
<TE>   As Friedman emphasizes, however, the transformation of law that
allowed for the emergence of a centralized and government-regulated
economy was the product (and not the cause) of changing social
conditions. A host of centripetal forces was unifying and shrinking
the vast expanse of America in the early 20th century. Railroads,
steamships and trucks in the hands of ever-larger corporations were
nationalizing the economy. Radio, especially as used by an orator
like Franklin Roosevelt, was drawing the country together,
establishing an ever more powerful role for national leadership.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the federal government was bound to grow, driven by
technology and population growth. As a matter of legal history, the
salient question was simply when the courts, conservative by nature,
would yield to this inevitability.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman makes much the same point in his treatment of civil
rights and race relations. In the early part of the century, the U.S.
Supreme Court handed down several progressive civil rights decisions.
In 1915, for example, it struck down the use of grandfather clauses,
a devious method of depriving blacks of their voting rights by
unfairly subjecting them to literacy and property requirements. Other
decisions of similar vintage recognized the rights of blacks to serve
on juries and partially protected blacks against the abusive system
of debt peonage, under which blacks were forced by white land-owners
to work their fields to pay off financial debts.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as Friedman astutely observes, these decisions, for all their
theoretical beneficence, were worthless as practical matters. They
changed nothing on the ground because, as Friedman writes, "there was
no follow-through; no will to follow through." In the absence of any
larger social momentum for reform, the Supreme Court's decisions were
limited to the facts of individual cases and the sys- tem remained
essentially untouched.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that judicial decisions are unimportant. Brown
v. Board of Education, in which the Supreme Court ordered the
desegregation of public schools, provided both a legal and a moral
catalyst for racial progress. But even before Brown in 1954, in the
optimistic glow of the post-World War II era, the idea of racial
equality under law was begin- ning to gain currency outside the
South.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the eventual (if still incomplete) success of Brown
depended not only on the court's continued demand for racial equality
but also on such outside factors as the advent of television, which
beamed the depravity of Jim Crow life into the homes of millions of
Americans, nurturing a belated national commitment to racial justice.</TE>
<TE>   For Friedman, then, the central lesson of a century of meteoric
legal change is that the law does not so much shape us as reflect
us--and the world we create. And, accordingly, if we want to
anticipate how the law will look in the years ahead, the best crystal
ball is not the court system but the technological and demographic
forces that ultimately shape our collective self.</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   Lee Siegel's ridicule and swipes are full of misstatements about
the Partisan Review conference (Book Review, Aug. 11), beginning with
the age of the magazine and facts about its earlier symposium. Had he
been present during my introduction, he would have known why I now
included "science and technology"; that Ray Kurzweil has received
rewards for his inventions from every American president since Lyndon
Johnson. He would have known that the one person who dozed off was
the reporter for the New York Sun. And that attendance lagged at
midday because professors and students were giving and taking final
exams.</LD>
<LD>   Norman Podhoretz did not shout his prepared paper, although he was
sharp after a member of the audience implied that the Sept. 11 attack
was America's just deserts. Yes, one (possibly) homeless man came to
eat our lunches, as did reporters who did not want to buy their own.
Should I have thrown anyone out?</LD>
<TE>   Clearly Siegel came to smear and sneer, and to put down
accomplished writers by accusing them of "embracing the capitalist
system," and so on. In fact, his "report" was not addressing
liberals, but the irresponsible fringe of the left by twisting, for
instance, Ozick's, Pryce-Jones' and Olitski's talks.</TE>
<TE>   His ad hominem attacks on "septuagenarian and octogenarian
participants" are what in other contexts he might call "ageism." Were
it applied to, for instance, Noam Chomsky or Howard Zinn, he might
sue.</TE>
<TE>   The transcripts of this conference can be read in Partisan Review
No. 4, which will be on newsstands in October.</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   While I appreciate the attention given to my book, "All Girls:
Single-Sex Education and Why It Matters" (Book Review, Sept. 8), I
would like to correct an error that led the reviewer to suggest a
conflict of interest on my part. She writes that at "the end of that
year" of research I "had enrolled [my] own daughter at Marlborough."
In fact, we did not even apply to Marlborough until two years later,
for entrance into the class that began three years after I undertook
my research. The manuscript was out of my hands before notification
letters went out, and no one at Marborough read the book until just
before its publication on Aug. 26: I did not want the school's
decision to in any way affect what I wrote, or for my work to
influence that decision.</LD>
<LD>   Had I found Marlborough to be anything less than it was, had I
discovered the problems the reviewer implies I left out, then I would
have written a different book, and we would have sent our daughter to
another school. Should she be penalized because I found that
Marlborough did, in fact, offer a supportive and dynamic environment?</LD>

<HD>'It's Pensions, Stupid!'</HD>
<DH>BANKING ON DEATH Or, Investing in Life: The History and
Future of Pensions, By Robin Blackburn, Verso: 550 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD>Kevin Phillips is the author of numerous books,
including "Wealth and Democracy: A Political History of the American
Rich."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pension and retirement funds in the United States are running neck
and neck with the housing bubble in press speculation about the next
financial implosion. Some pensioners with shrunken nest eggs already
report threadbare living. Others are simply postponing retirement.</LD>
<LD>   The future of the pension system is turning into a minefield. A
number of U.S. corporations, including General Motors, Lockheed and
United Airlines, have pension obligations well in excess of their
market capitalization. Three dozen companies in the S&amp;P 500 achieved
more than 10% of their reported corporate profits for 2001 on
estimates of future gains, never realized by the stock, in their
corporate pension funds, and now may have to furnish huge makeup
sums. The risks are rising for chief financial officers and retirees
alike.</LD>
<LD>   One can hardly pick up a newspaper without reading about some
company terminating, reshaping or skimming its pension fund. Or, for
that matter, about some state or municipal retirement system losing
hundreds of millions of dollars from the collapse of Enron and
WorldCom stocks and bonds.</LD>
<TE>   Washington is not pushing major new pension safeguards. In part,
that's because administration policymakers are still caught up in the
1990s bubble illusion that Social Security should be partly
privatized, putting some of its revenues into the eager hands of
America's financial services industry. Given their recent record,
this no longer makes sense, and some new thinking is in order. Maybe
a lot of new thinking.</TE>
<TE>   These facts make "Banking on Death," Robin Blackburn's new book on
the history and future of pensions, more timely and important reading
than we could have guessed a year ago. No one interested in pension
finance or pension rights can afford to miss it, although several
chapters, those dealing principally with Britain, need only be
skimmed by American readers. The United States subject matter is
dominant.</TE>
<TE>   Blackburn wears two hats, one as professor of sociology at the
University of Essex in Britain, the second as distinguished professor
of history at the New School University in New York. This is a plus
because much the same politico-financial games are going on in
Britain as in the United States, save that the abuses and issues
burgeoned first on that side of the Atlantic. This gives Blackburn
something of a leg up on the dicey position of pensions, being what
he calls "grey capital" in the homelands of Anglo-Saxon economics.</TE>
<TE>   Grey capital--G-R-E-Y, the British spelling, as in Lady Jane and
the tea--is not merely a state of in-between. It is a state of legal
uncertainty-cum-vulnerability verging on social peril. In 2000, U.S.
pension funds had $7 trillion under management, about a quarter of
the value of the overall stock market. The managing and trading of
them is a source of huge revenues for the major U.S. investment
firms.</TE>
<TE>   Let us get the definitions out of the way. The older variety of
pension is "defined benefit": defined because the eventual pension is
fixed, based on the salary earned by the employee. In the United
States, they accounted for $5 trillion in 2000. The newer variety is
called "defined contribution." Its ultimate payout--in a 401(k), for
example--varies with contributions, the markets and the investment
decision-making of the individual contributor. These plans had about
$2 trillion in 2000, but their ranks are growing as corporations try
to shed their old-style pension liability.</TE>
<TE>   The combined totals are less now, probably substantially less,
thanks to the popped stock market bubble and the attendant fraud,
manipulation and deceit epidemic both in corporate America and on
Wall Street. The legal problem, however, does not end with the "few
bad apples" of presidential rhetoric. It is much more systemic,
rising from the whole financial services orchard, its terrain,
fertilizer and maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Here is Blackburn's pithy summary: "The division of responsibility
between trustees, money managers and consultants, the power of the
sponsor and the limited rights of the policyholders or members all
conspire that retirement funds will be 'grey capital.' I use this
term because the property rights represented by the funds represents
a grey area in terms of law and political economy--that they are also
funds held to finance old age is a source of vulnerability to those
whose sacrifices have established them."</TE>
<TE>   His middle 200 pages flesh out the legal and political weaknesses
he sees: principally that the future entitlement of employees is a
legal question mark and one that an interrelated elite of politicians
and financiers would rather juggle than define. This section
culminates with a chapter titled "The Global Drive to Commodify
Pensions." By this, Blackburn means the attempt by many countries to
blend the existing public sector pensions with some portion of
privatized saving plans for retirement. The goal is usually to duck
the sort of government outlays that now seem inevitable, for example,
in the U.S. Social Security program.</TE>
<TE>   The private sector--the financial services folks--would thus get
their eager commercial hands on an ever-increasing portion of the
global retirement pot. In this part of the picture, future pensioners
would lose their defined benefit and get only what the market (or the
industry) leaves. Conservatives are the main drivers of this approach
but hardly the only ones.</TE>
<TE>   His last few chapters move on to possible public policy
recommendations and politics. Blackburn argues that pension policy
has already become a major national issue in Britain, France, Germany
and Italy; and we can probably expect it to become one in the United
States in light of the recent financial debacles.</TE>
<TE>   Pension provision, he says, "has already whetted the appetite of a
shark-like financial services industry, keen to sink its teeth into
this abundant shoal of business." On the other hand, opportunities
for turning pension rights into firm property rights could "also
encourage a more responsible pattern of social relations, one that
combats inequality and unemployment." The future key to many current
political and economic problems, he says, is "It's pensions, stupid!"</TE>
<TE>   Blackburn's solutions, some centrist, some more left-leaning, come
at the reader piecemeal. But he's certainly right about the great
potential for reshaping taxes, property rights, corporate governance
and federal regulation of finance that must accompany any great
political debate in the 2004 or 2008 presidential elections. Some of
his minor remedies simply draw on recent British legislation
requiring pension funds to become more active on behalf of
participants, creating pension ombudsmen and putting government price
caps on the fee charges (1% a year) of the basic private funds.</TE>
<TE>   However, his more sweeping proposals reflect the more advanced
discussion in Britain and have a potential to be relevant on this
side of the Atlantic as well. To begin with--and this idea has a
sweep that resonates--he proposes, in essence, that instead of
diluting their existing shares by issuing so many options to top
management, corporations should also be required to dilute them on
behalf of retirees. Each year, firms should be required to devote
some 20% of their profits to issuing new shares to the principal
national pension fund (Social Security) and to the various funds
approved for secondary (private) pension investment management.
Companies with solid, defined benefit pension funds already operating
would be excused half of this levy, which could bring in $100 billion
to $150 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   As for the secondary individual pensions in non-government hands
that would be favored by tax treatment, Blackburn would ensure by law
that they would be managed by vocational, regional and affinity
groups along the lines of TIAA-CREF (the very successful college
teachers fund), the California Public Employees Retirement System,
the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, the Retirement Systems of
Alabama and so on. Financial services firms, with their hidden fees
and sometimes antisocial objectives, would be barred and told to find
another honey pot.</TE>
<TE>   As a further source of revenue, taxes could be raised on the rich,
on financial transactions (the so-called Tobin tax) and on certain
types of gains in the value of private property created by public
outlays and investments. Blackburn also calls for related changes in
corporate governance and for new attention to clarifying and defining
individual property rights now only loosely associated with pensions.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the book's discussion is a little naive, especially when
one remembers that the finance, insurance and real estate sector of
the economy is the single biggest spender on both federal political
campaigns and federal lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the next few decades could see some movement in these
directions. Ordinary Americans could respond to the growth in wealth
polarization, scandals and the greed of recent years by taking back
some of that abusive wealth via taxes, regulations and reforms in
order to support the cost of pensions, education, health care and
drug prescriptions. This, after all, is what British voters did
during the first half of the 20th century.</TE>

<LD>IF HE HOLLERS LET HIM GO</LD>
<LD>   By Chester Himes</LD>
<LD>   Thunder's Mouth Press:</LD>
<TE>   204 pp., $13.95</TE>
<TE>   "If He Hollers Let Him Go" was first published in 1945 when
Chester Himes was 36, and its reissue today is a cause for
celebration. It is a relentless, gripping, classic novel, one of the
most powerful exposes of what it is like to be black in America. Bob
Jones, a well-educated shipyard worker in Los Angeles, is on his way
up. He's put in a leadership position at work, and his girlfriend is
a light-skinned black supervisor in the Los Angeles Department of
Social Welfare. He owns a car. But everywhere he turns there is
racism; his days are carpeted with discrimination, and his rage is
building to a boiling point.</TE>
<TE>   When a woman from Texas is asked to work in his group and says she
won't work for a "nigger," Jones calls her a "cracker" and is
instantly demoted. Realizing how little control he has over his own
life, he becomes more and more afraid. He sees the Japanese being
carried off to camps. He hears endless talk about communism, about
the relationship between race and class, but in his mind, the roots
of racism reach back beyond class and into sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "But now I was scared in a different way," Jones thinks after the
Texan woman, whom he has rejected, has wrongfully accused him of
rape. "Not of the violence. Not of the mob. Not of the physical hurt.
But of America, of American justice .... The whole structure of
American thought was against me; American tradition had convicted me
a hundred years before."</TE>
<TE>   Jones' girlfriend, Alice, buffered by money, begs him not to be
beaten by race, to "adjust himself to the limits of his race." But
the world of the shipyard is different from the comfortable world
that Alice lives in. Jones' fear and his fury bleed through the
pages. No reader, even now, 57 years later, of any color, gender or
economic class, is immune.</TE>

<TE>   THE HOUSE ON ECCLES ROAD</TE>
<TE>   By Judith Kitchen</TE>
<TE>   Graywolf: 226 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   It worked for Michael Cunningham, whose novel "The Hours," based
on "Mrs. Dalloway" by Virginia Woolf, is still a hit five years after
it was published. But Judith Kitchen has chosen an even more
difficult mold: "Ulysses" by James Joyce. "The House on Eccles Road"
takes place on June 16, sometime in the present. Leo Bluhm is an
English professor. His wife, Molly, was a singer of Irish music
before their son died at the age of 3. Since then, she has been
trapped in a solitary melancholy. June 16 is the couple's
anniversary, but Leo has forgotten. As the two go through their day,
Kitchen, like Joyce, follows their internal dialogue. Leo, in
appearance more functional than Molly, is clearly more helpless, but
he gets the final soliloquy.</TE>
<TE>   Molly's mind moves tidally between past and present, whereas Leo's
jumps and bumps from one unfinished thought to the next. Both suffer
in the loneliness of their marriage, but Molly has the survival
skills of her namesake. She is the one who gets the epiphany: She
will no longer wait for Leo; she will enjoy her life and go back to
singing. "She sang with her heart and her heart did not empty. For
eight years, her heart had been a sieve.... And now it was filling
slowly, like a reservoir."</TE>
<TE>   Like "The Hours," Kitchen's novel does not feel derivative, partly
because some stories can be told again and again, and partly because
she is a fine, imaginative writer.</TE>

<TE>   ON ALL SIDES NOWHERE</TE>
<TE>   Building a Life in Rural Idaho</TE>
<TE>   By William Gruber</TE>
<TE>   Mariner Books: 126 pp., $12 paper</TE>
<TE>   In the foreword to this memoir of William Gruber's seven years of
raising a young family in rural Idaho, William Finnegan complains
that most writing about nature and rural life is full of "[p]iety,
kitsch, self importance, sentimentalism--these deadly literary sins
seem to thrive on good clean country air. Even Thoreau, flinty
contrarian and poet laureate of bucolic solitude, packed a full load
of pomposity into 'Walden.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, these sins are nonexistent in Gruber's essays; the author
is more interested in the language of loggers and the economics of
rural life than he is in himself. This is fine in the essays in which
he is observing, but it leaves a space in the essays in which he
philosophizes. He is quite taken, for example, with the idea of
nothingness, life without reasons or meanings, just whatever has to
be done next. This would mean more if we knew him better.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, when he and his wife bought their log cabin on 40
acres, the back-to-the-land movement was in full swing. "The
hypocrisy of Nixon's America" sent many intellectuals running into
the woods. Gruber stayed for seven years, longer than most, but in
the end he left to become an English professor. He and his family
return in the summer, but it feels, he writes, as though they are
returning to "real life," that the rest is an illusion.</TE>

<LD>CONSTANCE</LD>
<LD>   By Catherine Cantrell</LD>
<LD>   Random House: 214 pp., $22.95</LD>
<TE>   The New Criticism. As any former English major can tell you, it's
all about the work itself. Novels and poems stand on their own, and
the people who create them are irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Clifford, whose father was an English professor, knows this
all too well. She's an editor at a white-shoe New York publishing
house and the probing narrator of Catherine Cantrell's mesmerizing
first novel, a brilliant meditation on the connections and
disconnections between life and art, and her career is at a
crossroads: "The idealism of my own early years had been worn down
... with a Brillo pad of defeated expectations." Enter Constance, a
mysterious poet who's equal parts Grace Kelly and Anne Sexton: She's
elegant and urbane yet transcendentally preoccupied with her work.
Her poetic output--reproduced with impressive aplomb by Cantrell--is
as prodigious as her flair for quoting Dickinson and Yeats.</TE>
<TE>   Bowled over by Constance's intensity and unknowability, Morgan
reawakens to the possibilities of literature. But her attempts to
really understand Constance, to indulge the "infinite pleasure in
being able to see the way a writer transforms a personal incident,"
never get very far. The "mystery that we have unveiled," she finds,
"often tends to obscure much larger mysteries."</TE>
<TE>   For the biggest mystery is that Constance does have a life, one
that ends up in the gossip pages and takes Morgan on a detour in
which friendship and mentorship become hopelessly entangled. With its
serene surface concealing an ocean of ambivalence, "Constance" is a
small masterpiece. Like Morgan's definition of the poet, it's a quiet
"volcano that ... erupts in a lava flow of language."</TE>

<TE>   THE RAINBOW SINGER</TE>
<TE>   By Simon Kerr</TE>
<TE>   Theia: 280 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   In Simon Kerr's fun-loving novel about an adolescent Protestant
Irish terrorist cut loose in Wisconsin, America is served up as a
fantasy land that's as ripe for worship as it is for ridicule.</TE>
<TE>   Wil Carson, Kerr's violence-prone teen antihero, proudly proclaims
himself "an up-and-coming member of the Belvoir Brigade of the Third
Battalion, the Ulster Freedom Fighters." He has been brought to
Packer Country to partake in a conciliation ritual in which pubescent
Protestants and Catholics from Belfast are hosted by nice Milwaukee
families with giggle-inducing surnames like Kuntz and Sticklegruber.
It is into this feel-good American dream of togetherness that Wil who
hates Catholics, or "Taigs," as much as he loves heavy metal and
"Happy Days" reruns, arrives like an infiltrating Old World sectarian
virus. The results are both hilarious and murderous, as Wil's
partisan exuberance is ratcheted up by an unlikely alliance with a
scary American jock known as Hulk.</TE>
<TE>   Even if tuna and cucumber subs aren't really standard Midwestern
fare, even if the Van Halen tune is "Eruption," not "Explosion," and
even if the Packers never won Super Bowls in the 1970s, Kerr, a
Belfast native, gets the territory right enough to show us a
disturbingly recognizable, if somewhat pat, America: a utopia of
flapjacks and theme parks with a healthy appetite for handguns and
revenge.</TE>

<TE>   THE SOUND OF THE TREES</TE>
<TE>   By Robert Gatewood</TE>
<TE>   Henry Holt: 294 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   Trude Mason, the teenage cowpoke of Robert Gatewood's hypnotic
novel, cuts an odd figure. He's a tyro Clint Eastwood, riding through
New Mexico at his own pace, eventually turning up in a lawless,
nameless town where morality has been turned inside out. The no-good
mayor tells him upfront: "The desert is no place, just as the
workings by which you wish to see the world turn are in fact no
workings at all. They are that which is imagined. They are a dream,
and no more."</TE>
<TE>   If the milieu of "The Sound of the Trees" (a suitably enigmatic
title) is wall-to-wall Sergio Leone, its soul is pure Dorothea Lange,
for Gatewood's version of the Wild West isn't set in the days of the
OK Corral but in the Dust Bowl 1930s. Nevertheless, Trude still gets
around on horseback, setting out, as the novel begins, with his
mother to escape his abusive father.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to ride to Colorado, but this promised land slips out
of Trude's reach after his mother succumbs to a snakebite and he
witnesses a dreadful crime involving a young black girl. Waylaid in
this New Mexico town full of menacing eccentrics, he naively seeks
justice and becomes an object of general suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   Gatewood does his best to keep civilization at bay: So thorough is
the mood of tumbleweed nihilism that we have to remind ourselves that
Roosevelt is in office. If "The Sound of the Trees" is overly
infatuated with its own sense of foreboding, it's also a seductive
reminder that, not so very long ago, the West was still wild.</TE>

<DH>TONIGHT AT NOON: A Love Story, By Sue Graham Mingus,
Pantheon: 288 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARAM SAROYAN</AU>
<BD>Aram Saroyan is the author of "Artists in Trouble: New
Stories," "Starting Out in the Sixties: Selected Essays" and "Rancho
Mirage: An American Tragedy of Manners, Madness and Murder."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1979, the last year of his life, Charles Mingus was dismayed when
a radio commentator, during a rebroadcast of a Mingus concert in New
Orleans, praised an early composition of his but got its musical
lineage wrong. "I was inspired by Duke Ellington, Debussy,
Stravinsky, Bartok," he said. "It had nothing to do with [jazz
bassist] Oscar Pettiford."</LD>
<LD>   Ellington was his lifelong idol, and because Mingus also composed
for the full orchestral palette, he is Ellington's truest successor.
His only rival, Thelonious Monk, was perfectly at home with the small
ensemble (although his music is periodically the subject of
successful orchestral settings).</LD>
<LD>   I remember seeing Mingus one night at Birdland during the 1960s.
He stood with his bass to the left on a bandstand that included
reeds, horns and a rhythm section, and though his players had scores,
Mingus would spontaneously call on soloists or indicate whole
sections for particular emphasis or unrehearsed interludes. It was as
if he was playing his bass and his orchestra simultaneously.</LD>
<TE>   His body of work is among the most emotionally protean with one of
the most varied and informed musical pedigrees in American history.
In addition to the influences he names above, his compositions
embrace gospel, blues, R&amp;B, salsa and Afro-Cuban strains--often in
boldly articulated "movements." Works such as "Fables of Faubus,"
"Self Portrait in Three Colors," "Reincarnation of a Lovebird" and
"Sue's Changes" are American classics.</TE>
<TE>   When the New Thing in jazz came along in the 1960s, Mingus readily
integrated free jazz intervals into the body of his compositions. But
we learn in "Tonight at Noon: A Love Story," his widow Sue Graham
Mingus' telling and moving memoir, that he considered musicians
playing exclusively free jazz to be at best incomplete. "You don't do
anything all the time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Mingus reports a conversation between her husband and
Ellington apropos the New Jazz, then at its height, quoting from a
piece Mingus wrote: " 'Duke, why don't you, me and Dizzy [Gillespie]
and Clark Terry and Thad Jones get together and make an avant-garde
record?' Duke's reply was very quick: 'Why should we go back that
far? Let's not take music back that far, Mingus. Why not just make a
modern record?' "</TE>
<TE>   Mingus died at 56 of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known
as Lou Gehrig's disease. Even so, his body of work is the second
largest in jazz, exceeded only by Ellington's, and includes major
compositions still to be recorded.</TE>
<TE>   Like his music, Mingus' life was multifaceted and inclusive,
running the gamut from a childhood and adolescence in the Watts
ghetto of Los Angeles to concerts in the capitals of Europe and the
Americas; there were friendships with, among others, Norman Mailer
and Joni Mitchell, who, late in his life, became a collaborator. Sue
Mingus records her husband's first meeting with Mitchell, which
occurred when he was already dying:</TE>
<TE>   "They were an unlikely couple, Joni and Charles: Joni, a singer
who didn't read music, who refused to risk her gifts or her intuition
by submitting them to formal study. And Charles, who, as a teenager
in Los Angeles, studied composition and music theory with the
legendary Lloyd Reese and mastered the classical bass with Herman
Rheinshagen, the retired principal bassist of the New York
Philharmonic. Joni's musical talents fell into place on their own, a
natural outgrowth of her poetry.</TE>
<TE>   " 'You're the hillbilly singer,' Charles ... said to her
straight-faced from his wheelchair when she first walked into our
living room. She stopped dead at the entrance and stared at him
without speaking. He'd caught her off guard. She was standing beside
Don Alias, tall, black, and handsome, the jazz percussionist who was
living with her then. She was taller than I had imagined and looked
surprisingly serious. Suddenly she relaxed. She looked at Charles
slyly and burst out laughing. They liked each other from the start."</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 1964, at the Manhattan funeral of my boyhood friend
Steve Reichman, who had died in Europe over his summer break from
NYU, I was surprised and moved when it was announced that Charles
Mingus, unseen behind the proscenium curtain, would play a solo bass
eulogy. The austerely beautiful solo, and Mingus' generosity to the
family of his young fan, was a moving gesture at the abrupt end of a
promising life. Earlier that same year, Sue Graham had been
introduced to Mingus at the Five Spot, the Greenwich Village jazz
club where he was performing. She was married to an Italian artist at
the time and was the mother of a young son and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   A Milwaukee debutante and Smith graduate, Graham had broken with
her 1950s upbringing and embarked on her own adventurous odyssey
during a visit to Europe. And she was living in Manhattan as the
1960s began to go into gear. Pursued by the tumultuous, imperious but
also loving jazz legend, she was alternately overwhelmed and
repelled. For years the two, married first by Allen Ginsberg in an
impromptu ceremony at an Upper East Side townhouse and a second time
at City Hall, maintained separate addresses. Eventually Sue Mingus
not only merged her life with her husband's but, in the two decades
since his death, has also become the central figure in the
perpetuation and proliferation of his musical legacy, releasing his
performances on her own label--started to thwart rampant bootlegging
of his music--as well as initiating the first large ensemble to
perform his music posthumously.</TE>
<TE>   One of this book's many pleasures is the record, rendered in
intimate close-up, of the loving camaraderie in the African American
musical community:</TE>
<TE>   "[Mingus] remembered a concert in Europe long ago when Dizzy was
playing on the bandstand and he was standing below, some distance
away, thinking about Dizzy's importance and hoping Dizzy would live
forever. Although his back was turned, Dizzy swung around suddenly
and asked out loud where all the love he felt was coming from. Then
he looked straight at Charles.</TE>
<TE>   " 'You really do love me, don't you?' Dizzy said. 'I felt just
then like I was in heaven!' "</TE>
<TE>   When Mingus arrives one night at the Village Vanguard to hear
Miles Davis, the trumpeter "came over, wiped Charles's face with his
hands (wiping his own blackness onto Charles's mongrel skin, as
Charles later explained), and tussled his hair. Then Miles headed for
the bandstand.</TE>
<TE>   "Charles smiled happily, 'I don't feel lonesome anymore,' he
said."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Mingus practiced what he called "creative anger"
and would often berate members of his audience for making disruptive
noise during his performances. When his friend Timothy Leary wanted
him to try LSD, which he believed would allow "people [to] shed their
old neurotic imprints and begin again," his wife reports that "Mingus
was less interested in shedding his imprint than in changing the
world's."</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm not perfect," he told Leary, "but I don't want to play
bass any different. I don't want to write music any different."</TE>
<TE>   When disease strikes, he suffers its swift, merciless advance with
bravery and humor, while at the same time driving his wife to her
limits and beyond. After trying Western medicine, they soon look to
alternative varieties, including a stop at a clinic in Montreux,
where Mingus receives "a dozen injections from the organs of an
unborn lamb. Lamb liver cells. Lamb heart cells. Lamb kidney cells.
Lamb pancreas."</TE>
<TE>   Sharing a hospital room with separate beds, Sue Mingus awakens
early the next morning: "In the semi-darkness I watched him as he lay
in bed. He looked crucified. He could barely move his body .... I
realized his eyes were open and that he had been watching me as well.
Suddenly his mouth quivered and emitted a long, low sound:
'B-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a ....' "</TE>
<TE>   With a small team in tow, acting on a tip from Gerry Mulligan, the
couple stops last in Mexico, where they eventually take up residence
at a rented villa in Cuernavaca and Mingus is treated by a
72-year-old female Indian witch doctor named Pachita and her
lieutenants. Her treatment culminates with a miraculously (or
fraudulently) bloodless surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually paralyzed but still meeting each day with appetite,
Mingus dies not long afterward of a heart attack. Honoring his
wishes, his widow makes a pilgrimage to scatter his ashes over the
Ganges, "certain that the raw air beneath the dark range of the
Himalayas was made for the life of the spirit and for reincarnation,
as he believed."</TE>
<TE>   To listen to the music of Charles Mingus is to hear darkness and
light, pain and jubilation, beauty and beast, in an enchanted musical
continuum. Sue Mingus survives and perpetuates her husband with a
loving, exacting portrait: "Tonight at Noon," titled after one of her
husband's compositions, has the emotional fluency and power of
Mingus' own music.</TE>

<AU>EUGEN WEBER</AU>
<BD>Eugen Weber is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dangerously destructive insect, the glassy-winged sharpshooter,
poses a serious threat to the multibillion-dollar wine industry of
Napa Valley. The SUV of leafhoppers, this pest that vectors a
disaster more lethal to vines than phylloxera functions as the
central figure in Nadia Gordon's novel "Sharpshooter." Talk of its
appearance in the vineyard country around the little town of St.
Helena fills everyone with alarm; the prospect of chemical warfare
against the hungry intruder threatens the existence of nearby organic
farms. Everyone is worried, everyone is at loggerheads. It is in this
context that the sniper-style shooting of Jack Beroni, heir of the
great Beroni Vineyard Estate and a determined advocate of spraying,
sets the community on its ears.</LD>
<LD>   The vic was widely disliked, so there's little regret at his
offing, and there's a wealth of potential perps. But the Beronis'
neighbor, Wade Skord of Skord Mountain Vineyards, producer of an
admired bijou brew, is the prime suspect. Wade, who has been heard to
threaten Jack, plays assault golf at night, shooting at
glow-in-the-dark golf balls with his .22 rifle. The police think that
he could easily have targeted his arrogant neighbor. His friend,
Sunny McCuskey, owner and chef of a popular local cafe restaurant,
vehemently disagrees. Resolute and resourceful, she will try to prove
the police wrong.</LD>
<TE>   That is the gist of Gordon's story, and the reasons to read it are
many: It's readable, the violence is minimal and, above all, the
book's local color and its culinary, oenological and ecological
details are priceless. Sunny, who rolls her own pasta and uses only
organically correct vittles, cannot resist cooking and sipping even
outside her own restaurant. Since her friends are in the same league,
investigation takes a back seat to palate-tickling gourmandizing and
epicurizing. There's enough about cooking, eating and drinking to
give you an appetite before you're halfway through. Everyone samples,
sniffs, sips, savors or, occasionally, guzzles. The effect is silly,
charming, incoherent and fun to taste. I only wish I could get hold
of some of that Grgich Fume Blanc.</TE>
<TE>   Double-cross and double-dealing on all sides, traffic in drugs,
videos and human beings, kidnapping, smuggling, murder, rape, lies,
betrayal, impostures, evasions, pursuits, snares and pitfalls throng
Val McDermid's "The Last Temptation" and set its feverish pace.</TE>
<TE>   A ruthless international trafficker and an equally ruthless but
more impenetrable psychopathic serial killer are being tracked by
British, German and Dutch police forces and by Europol, but
especially by Dr. Tony Hill, a psychologist-profiler, and his
once-and-again partner, Det. Chief Inspector Carol Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   When you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. As Tony and
Carol struggle to unravel the web of danger and deceit they're caught
up in, to save their threatened lives and help each other, the
syncopated plot leads them to Berlin and along the Rhine. The
apparently separate cases interweave to carry them through a
crime-streaked string of startling incidents, adventures and
misadventures. Relentless, electric and absorbing, this is a thriller
not to miss.</TE>
<TE>   In Alan Furst's latest, it is November 1940. Victorious in both
East and West, the Germans are trying to bomb Britain into submission
and are gearing up to invade Russia. Serebin, a Russian emigre writer
living in German-occupied Paris, boards a Bulgarian freighter from
the Romanian port of Constanta to Istanbul. He is part of a circus of
British-run amateur spies chugging through southeastern
Europe--Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and France. Objective: to
deny the Germans use of the Romanian oil crucial to their tanks and
planes. Oil is the "blood of victory"; and Furst charts the Keystone
Kop-like endeavors of Serebin &amp; Co. to sabotage the Germans through a
Luna Park of local designs, swings, roundabouts, conspiracies,
revolts, betrayals and varied bloodlettings.</TE>
<TE>   Furst has researched the historical background, as he always does,
and the chronology of four crowded winter months would be enough to
keep us panting. But, though there are trysts and narrow escapes
aplenty, Furst's settings matter more than politics, incidental
intrigues more than international ones, social skirmishes more than
armed encounters. Atmosphere is all, especially in spy thrillers, and
Furst is a master atmosphere-spinner. Understated sentiment,
deprecatory charm, digressions aplenty, more nuances than action,
more subtlety than slaughter, hints, nudges, whispers and incredible
stories one would like to believe are the ingredients of his style.
The recipe has worked before, and here it works again. Who would want
to complain?</TE>
<TE>   And here is one for amateurs of the esoteric, of astral romances
and occult arts for suckers. A.W. Hill's hero, Stephan Raszer, is a
tracker who pursues "strays": the credulous gulls of gnostic
predators. "Enoch's Portal" is a re-presentation of the sad saga of
the Solar Temple and of the victims of its mystic moonshine. The
stray whom Raszer tracks is Sofia Gould, wife of a Hollywood mogul,
and the quest for the seductive Sofia leads him to Prague where the
past is far from past, and to the Australian wilderness where it is
very present indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Raszer's checkered pilgrimage from Hollywood to desolate outback
allows for much talk of thanatos and cosmic cremation, of cults,
cabbalists, alchemists, magi, sufis, shamans, masons, Cathars,
Templars and their secrets, international financiers and financial
skulduggery of a high order. Collateral damage is heavy. Some names
are coded. Gould represents fool's gold that alchemists promised;
Sofia might be Wisdom, if she didn't lack it; the evil raptor and
inveigler-in-chief is Fourche, a cloven-hooved devil (mis)leading his
self-deceived followers into a neo-Cathar suicide snare that promises
to use quantum physics to blow them into a parallel universe.</TE>
<TE>   Raszer himself oscillates between rationality and crackpot-ism.
Accredited to Interpol, he patronizes herbalists, diets on soy
protein and wheat grass, suffers from visions, hallucinations,
dizziness and premonitory dreams and doesn't know quite what to make
of the pseudology and pseudoscience he encounters.</TE>
<TE>   The author, too, seems of two minds whether to take his mysteries
at face value. But he serves them up in "Enoch's Portal" in a
fast-paced narrative full of twists, turns, thrills and turbulence.
If you believe or suspend disbelief, it makes an enticing yarn.</TE>

<LD>Sometime in late spring, the mailings start to arrive: season
announcements from area theaters, providing a range of shows for
nearly every taste. Usually there's a familiar name on the
roster--maybe a playwright or a production, an actor or a director.
Often there's a world premiere or a local premiere. Occasionally,
there's a classic. Always there are surprises. For some venues, the
season has already started; for others, September marks the beginning
of the year. In scanning the rosters, many people wonder how these
shows were selected. Is there a magical formula involved in putting
together a season? We asked the decision-makers at five theaters to
share how they made selections.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Here's how it works: Three people sit down in an office. One is an
actor-director from a small town in Illinois who loves Harold Pinter
and Sam Shepard; another is an L.A.-bred Valley girl who prefers
Shakespeare and Suzan-Lori Parks; and a third, myself, a New Yorker
from the Bronx whose taste runs the gamut from Arthur Miller to
vaudeville. And, believe it or not, we pick the plays. Sounds simple
enough, but it's the trickiest part of running a theater.</LD>
<TE>   My colleagues Randall Arney, artistic director, and Amy Levinson
Millan, literary manager, help me in choosing a balanced, diverse
season. And only three such different people with such diverse tastes
could make this mix work.</TE>
<TE>   The key for us, what makes us feel as though we've chosen
successfully, is that our audiences never know what to expect when
they walk in the door. Here is a peek at next season, in which we
have tried to choose plays that not only satisfy us, but also appeal
to a broad, venturesome theatrical audience.</TE>
<TE>   Our first production, "Under the Blue Sky," by 28-year-old
Englishman David Eldridge, is a wicked, intelligent play about the
nature of love and sex. Bill Haber, a Broadway producer and friend of
the Geffen, optioned the New York rights. Bill gave it to me to read
for my opinion, and I knew I wanted to direct it. Much to my
pleasure, Randall and Amy loved it as well. With Bill's approval, we
are one of the first theaters to produce it in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   I think it is important to keep developing the audience of
tomorrow. In this vein, we have presented Mabou Mines' "Peter and
Wendy," "Ennio" and, last season, "Do Jump!" This season, Debbie
Allen and James Ingram have written a contemporary version of Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs for the family called "Pearl."</TE>
<TE>   A goal of mine since the inception of this theater in 1995 is to
bring in one event seasonally that is unlike anything our audience
has ever seen. Ideally, this nontraditional, theatrical event is
something our subscribers can bring their children to, although that
is not always the case.</TE>
<TE>   Next, we are producing the world premiere of Neil Simon's "Rose
and Walsh." The Geffen had a reading of this play after the
successful presentation this year of Neil's new look at the "Odd
Couple," "Oscar and Felix." Lee Grant, John Larroquette, Brendan
Fraser and Dinah Manoff participated in the reading. "Rose and Walsh"
is a rich and profoundly moving story about the nature of love and
its ability to outlive us all. We are pleased to have the opportunity
to be the first to produce this play by one of America's most beloved
playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy Gets Girl," by Rebecca Gilman, was sent to Randall by a
friend. The evocative nature of the play, which is both a thriller
and an in-depth look at sexual politics in the '90s, attracted
Randall to directing the play. This is important to us, as Randall
and I are both looking for material that we are interested in
directing, so it plays an important role in the season selection.
Usually, these are the plays we discover first, and then we are able
to design and balance a season around those choices.</TE>
<TE>   Closing our season is Richard Nelson's "Franny's Way," which was
found the old-fashioned way. Amy read a blurb about it, called the
writer's agent and had it sent over. Within five days, we all had
read it and moved on getting the rights. What we were most attracted
to is the time and place in which the story is told. Mr. Nelson has
written a new play with fresh ideas that is at once nostalgic and
contemporary.</TE>
<TE>   It would be insincere to say that our personal tastes do not play
a role in our season selection, but the key here is that the deciding
parties have very different tastes. Don't be surprised though if one
of these days we have Shakespeare, Pinter and "Minsky's Burlesque" in
one season.</TE>

<LD>Sometime in late spring, the mailings start to arrive: season
announcements from area theaters, providing a range of shows for
nearly every taste. Usually there's a familiar name on the
roster--maybe a playwright or a production, an actor or a director.
Often there's a world premiere or a local premiere. Occasionally,
there's a classic. Always there are surprises. For some venues, the
season has already started; for others, September marks the beginning
of the year. In scanning the rosters, many people wonder how these
shows were selected. Is there a magical formula involved in putting
together a season? We asked the decision-makers at five theaters to
share how they made selections.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   It might appear from time to time that I throw darts or consult a
Ouija board to select the plays that make up any given season at the
Mark Taper Forum. But in reality, the selection process is a complex,
shifting and, for me, utterly appealing and addictive puzzle that one
can assemble only after reading, seeing, discussing and putting into
development a great number of plays. I live and breathe theater on a
24-hour basis throughout the year, and eventually the pieces begin
falling into place.</LD>
<TE>   The planning of this season, the 36th season at the Music Center,
commenced in the shadows of Sept. 11. I've always believed in the
theater as a communal space for artists and audiences to come
together and assert our humanity, but never more so than in this last
year, and I'm sure this affected my choices.</TE>
<TE>   The first question I always ask is, where does my heart, my head
and my view of the world take me? I then share this with the staff,
and we ask: Can this be communicated to an audience?</TE>
<TE>   For compelling reasons, I initially picked as the opening play
Tony Kushner's amazing "Homebody/Kabul." But after some reflection, I
thought we might serve Tony better by giving him the time he
requested to work further on the piece. So in late July, I decided to
postpone the play to the next season, and the scramble was on to pick
a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the quality of "Homebody/Kabul," the replacement had to
have some grit and size and a bigger theme than a nice and
comfortable four-character play. "Nickel and Dimed" fits the bill
with its insistence that we understand the problems of the working
poor and that we ask our predominantly middle-class audience what can
be done to help. And "Nickel and Dimed" has a fortuitous connection
with "Living Out," which deals with child care and nannies and the
dependence of the affluent on the working class.</TE>
<TE>   Both "Living Out" and "Chavez Ravine" are products of our
commissioning and new play development programs and tell important
Los Angeles stories. The irony of "Chavez Ravine" is that I was born
in the shadow of Ebbets Field, I am a lifelong fan, and I thought the
Dodgers had betrayed Brooklyn by leaving. So what did I do? I
followed them out here. And now I want to tell the true story of
Chavez Ravine and how a failed urban housing project dislocated a
community long before the Dodgers ever thought of coming into the
neighborhood. The Dodgers today represent the kind of
diversity--players and fans--that mirrors our dreams for the theater.</TE>
<TE>   "Big River" was a natural choice, given my history with "Children
of a Lesser God." With such a glorious combination of folk tale,
Broadway musical, and the originality of signing as language and
visual poetry, I knew I had to find a way to include it, especially
as a co-production with local Deaf West Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   With "Ten Unknowns" and "Gem of the Ocean," I'm choosing our
history with the writers. We have a valued ongoing relationship with
Jon Robin Baitz and August Wilson. I'm attracted to Baitz's "Ten
Unknowns" because the play says something about art and the artist's
struggle for recognition. I'm intrigued by "Gem of the Ocean"
because, after presenting five of the plays in Wilson's journey
through the 20th century, I can't wait to witness what will be the
first chapter of this cycle--how it all began!</TE>
<TE>   The choices are made. All of these plays are in some stage of
development, and it's exciting to be part of the process. Also built
into the season is a greater degree of diversity approaching more
what I consider an ideal relationship with our community.</TE>
<TE>   I can't predict if it will be a successful season. The puzzle is
never finished until we include the crucial component: our audience.
But I think there are enough qualities of entertainment, history, and
social and cultural imperatives that we have a shot at it. And that's
what makes the choices worthwhile.</TE>

<LD>Sometime in late spring, the mailings start to arrive: season
announcements from area theaters, providing a range of shows for
nearly every taste. Usually there's a familiar name on the
roster--maybe a playwright or a production, an actor or a director.
Often there's a world premiere or a local premiere. Occasionally,
there's a classic. Always there are surprises. For some venues, the
season has already started; for others, September marks the beginning
of the year. In scanning the rosters, many people wonder how these
shows were selected. Is there a magical formula involved in putting
together a season? We asked the decision-makers at five theaters to
share how they made selections.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   We've been doing this for 39 seasons and it hasn't gotten any
easier: It's still risky. When we started, we had a 75-seat theater
and no money. We knew that if one show blew up in our faces, we might
be gone in a week. Now we have greater resources and stability, but
the decisions seem just as challenging. And with one-third of the
South Coast Repertory season being new plays that are untested,
anything can happen.</LD>
<TE>   Still, it is through the new work that the season begins to take
shape. Most new plays we produce are commissioned and developed at
South Coast Rep, so there is a degree of anticipating some
plays--especially with writers we've worked with repeatedly over the
years, like Richard Greenberg, Amy Freed, Howard Korder and Donald
Margulies. This year's new plays arrive from different directions.</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg's "The Violet Hour" traces its roots back to his
residency here during the 2000 premiere of "Everett Beekin." He saw
the plans for our new 336-seat theater and said he'd like to write
the play that opened it. Given his exceptional talents and track
record, we were honored and said, "Great. Let's see what you come up
with." When "The Violet Hour" came in, we were thrilled. It seemed a
perfect fit for this landmark occasion as it celebrates the nature of
personal history, with a nod to the ability of theater to celebrate
our communal history.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Nottage's "Intimate Apparel," on the other hand, has had a
more formal gestation. Several years ago, when we offered Lynn a
commission, we learned that Center Stage in Baltimore was equally
enthusiastic about supporting her. So we went in together.</TE>
<TE>   Now both coasts will see what we all feel is Lynn's breakthrough
play, and the shared premiere should give it a significant entrance
onto the American theater scene.</TE>
<TE>   Our next step was to complement the new work with existing plays
that are artistically exciting to us and provide challenge and
variety for our audience.</TE>
<TE>   As a playwright's theater, we are always drawn to the word, to
language and ideas. We chose George Bernard Shaw's "Major Barbara" to
open the season in the renovated Segerstrom Stage because it concerns
the timely question of what governs a society. Is it really elected
officials, or is it those who have the power through economic
resources to make their needs known?</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the season fell into place without too much
difficulty: Shakespeare's "Two Gentlemen of Verona," the West Coast
premiere of Horton Foote's "The Carpetbagger's Children" and Alan
Ayckbourn's "Relatively Speaking."</TE>
<TE>   However, two new plays that were successful elsewhere took some
negotiating in order to bring them to SCR.</TE>
<TE>   When David Auburn's "Proof" won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize, the
rights to produce it were locked up for the national tour. We weighed
whether to do the play this season or wait until the memory of the
recent L.A. run had faded. But because one of our primary
responsibilities is to provide our Orange County audience with
productions of important contemporary plays, we decided to schedule
"Proof" in January.</TE>
<TE>   Our interest in "The Drawer Boy" predates its successful run in
Canada and Chicago, but the rights only recently became available.
This play is especially important to us at this time. It takes us
back to our youth as a theater inasmuch as a young actor is gathering
material for a play that he will be producing. And this young man, in
using his art to befriend two old farmers, ends up freeing them from
a lot of their personal myths and fears, and learning something about
himself in the process.</TE>
<TE>   So, after years of choosing seasons, it's as tough as it ever was.
We read and see a lot of plays, and we put together those that we
believe will provide our audience with a stimulating journey. And we
still believe in the transforming power of theater to confront ideas,
stir emotions, and enrich our lives.</TE>

<KH>How I Chose My Season</KH>
<HD>'Our Approach Involves Asking for Artists' Dream Projects'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime in late spring, the mailings start to arrive: season
announcements from area theaters, providing a range of shows for
nearly every taste. Usually there's a familiar name on the
roster--maybe a playwright or a production, an actor or a director.
Often there's a world premiere or a local premiere. Occasionally,
there's a classic. Always there are surprises. For some venues, the
season has already started; for others, September marks the beginning
of the year. In scanning the rosters, many people wonder how these
shows were selected. Is there a magical formula involved in putting
together a season? We asked the decision-makers at five theaters to
share how they made selections.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Our major obstacle in planning the 2002 season was an acute
shortage of time. I returned to the La Jolla Playhouse in October
2000 with barely enough leeway to assemble an artistic staff and
scramble our 2001 season together. We certainly didn't have the
luxury of planning ahead! Last fall, I had just opened a major
musical when I found myself facing the looming needs of 2002.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike most theaters, where seasons run from fall to spring, our
season operates from spring to fall because of our relationship with
UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Our approach to season planning involves speaking to leading
artists we are interested in and asking for their dream projects.
Because we don't simply choose plays and seek hirelings to direct
them, season planning can be particularly arduous. Although we of
course face financial restrictions, we're less interested in
concocting a balanced mix than in producing work that has the drive
and passion of theater artists fulfilling their dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Mee's play "Wintertime" crossed my desk and I devoured it.
I passed it to my associate artistic director, Shirley Fishman; my
literary manager, Carrie Ryan; and my assistant, Amy Tripodi. By the
next morning, I was securing the world premiere. Happily,
"Wintertime's" director at Sundance Theatre Lab, Les Waters, is a
professor at UC San Diego's department of theater and dance, with
whom we share our theaters.</TE>
<TE>   After calls to new artists and our "alumni," projects started
cropping up. Playhouse favorite, modern clown Geoff Hoyle came up
with "A Feast of Fools," a retrospective of his extraordinary body of
work. This was a slam-dunk--a vintage project of manageable size. I
wanted to do one of Shakespeare's low comedies before Sept. 11 but
felt, given our recent history, that this was an empty choice. I
turned my attention instead to Moliere's "Tartuffe." We'd had a big
success with "I Am My Own Wife" in workshop the year before, which
starred Jefferson Mays, a former student who has matured into a
national treasure of an actor. Moliere and Jeff, combined with
religious hypocrisy and fanaticism, would open the season.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, we lost two musicals that we were considering but almost
simultaneously came up with two world premieres: Heather McDonald's
"When Grace Comes In" and Jose Rivera's "Adoration of the Old Woman."
Heather's "An Almost Holy Picture," which also premiered at the
playhouse, went on to a successful run on Broadway this season, and
Jose's play was a long-outstanding playhouse commission. We were
delighted when he finished it in the nick of time.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that we had no musical for 2002. We don't feel
required to do one every year, but we do love to celebrate the
musical's integral place in the American theatrical repertoire. It's
home-grown, after all. It belongs to us. Happily, my assistant and I
saw Mabou Mines' glorious production of "Peter &amp; Wendy" in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Breuer's breathtaking piece pushes many of the same emotional
buttons that musicals go for and generates the same visceral
excitement. It also fulfills part of the playhouse's mission--to
invite visionary theater troupes to present their work here,
broadening our audience's theatrical experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, we presented "The Laramie Project" by the Tectonic
Theater Project; the year before, the Improbable Theatre's
"Lifegame." In fact, Moises Kaufman, "Laramie's" director, suggested
this year's play for our Page to Stage workshop--his colleague Leigh
Fondakowski's production of "I Think I Like Girls." This is a piece
that we're developing in front of audiences, without critics. When we
welcomed the actors from "Laramie," we wanted them to make La Jolla
Playhouse a home away from home, and they have. I made a similar
invitation this year to Chuck Mee, and I sincerely hope he returns.</TE>
<TE>   In writing this piece, I think it's worth pointing out that we're
much further along in planning the 2003 season, which opens next May.
I suppose it's possible that this careful planning may backfire and
that we should be sticking with the kind of high-velocity, knee-jerk
hysteria that's worked so well the last two seasons. 2002 features
five world premieres--sometimes it's fun working without a net! But
frankly, it's great to have some time to think.</TE>

<LD>   The umpteenth remake of A.E.W. Mason's classic adventure "The Four
Feathers" features a hip, young cast--Heath Ledger, near right with
Wes Bentley, and Kate Hudson--and a critically lauded director,
Shekhar Kapur, who guided Cate Blanchett in her breakout role in
"Elizabeth." Ledger plays a young British officer who must redeem his
honor in 1898 Sudan after his friends and fiancee brand him a coward.
Djimon Hounsou and Michael Sheen co-star.</LD>
<LD>   Also: "The Banger Sisters" were with a lot of bands in their day
(Pamela Des Barres has nothing on this pair). But that was a long
time ago. Now Suzette (Goldie Hawn), who can't let go of the past,
needs her ol' groupie pal Vinnie (Susan Sarandon), who's living the
garden party life in the 'burbs, to help her out in writer-director
Bob Dolman's boomer comedy. Geoffrey Rush co-stars.</LD>
<TE>   Theater</TE>
<TE>   Social essayist and cultural critic Barbara Ehrenreich spent most
of 1998 working "undercover" in low-paying jobs--as a waitress, a
maid, a nursing home assistant and a Wal-Mart sales clerk--learning
firsthand how the working poor were affected by the welfare reform of
the late 1990s. Joan Holden's world-premiere drama, "Nickel and
Dimed," based on Ehrenreich's book about her experience and featuring
Sharon Lockwood, right, opens Thursday at the Mark Taper Forum in
downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Art</TE>
<TE>   "Thomas Struth," a survey of contemporary photographs by the noted
German artist spanning 1977 to the present, opens at MOCA at
California Plaza in downtown L.A. and continues through Jan. 5. Also
opening with Struth: "Conversations," an exhibition of recent
acquisitions to the permanent collection. It will be a rotating show
of works by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Frank, Lari
Pittman and others. And finally, flamboyant new monumental sculpture
by Nancy Rubins appropriately titled "Chas' Stainless Steel, Mark
Thompson's Airplane Parts, About 1000 Pounds of Stainless Steel Wire
and Gagosian's Beverly Hills Space" is installed at MOCA today.</TE>
<TE>   Dance</TE>
<TE>   As Americans debate the merits of war in Iraq, the ancient Hindu
epic "Bhagvad Gita" couldn't be more relevant. Tonight at the Irvine
Barclay Theatre, this profound poetic meditation on the consequences
of a just but cataclysmic conflict will be presented as a classical
Indian dance-drama, performed by Viji Prakash and her local Shakti
Dance Company, along with guest stars from Malaysia and India. The
production is also scheduled to be seen in San Francisco,
Bakersfield, San Diego, Houston and Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   Eminem, Slum Village and Bahamadia are just some of the hip-hop
forces that got key early exposure on the annual Lyricist Lounge
tour, which showcases emerging artists on a bill with established
stars. Redman, Keith Murray and Erick Sermon fill the latter role
this year, setting the stage for Skillz, Poverty and Wordsworth. The
tour comes to the House of Blues Anaheim on Thursday and the West
Hollywood branch on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Video</TE>
<TE>   John Goodman and Billy Crystal supply the voices for the
delightful computer-animated "Monsters, Inc." Randy Newman won an

<HD>He's Staging the Revolt</HD>
<DH>UCLA's first International Theatre Festival sought bold,
revolutionary work. Not the kind that tells familiar stories. Or even
tells stories at all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT TIMBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Sefton knows what it's like to suffer for his art.</LD>
<LD>   "I found myself trapped in a room with a French puppet theater of
found objects," says Sefton, who's just put together UCLA's first
International Theatre Festival. "Stuck, for two hours, watching a man
playing with potatoes and making funny noises." Another winner:
"Eight-hour, high-naturalist versions of Russian masterpieces, done
in Polish with no subtitles. Believe me, I've done a lot of those.
And one of the most annoying things you see are these new New York
companies--it's like being stuck in a religious cult, where people
are just worshiping this stuff, laughing hysterically. I sit there
thinking, 'What are you all laughing at?' "</LD>
<LD>   Amid the sea of dross, though, the 39-year-old Liverpudlian
beginning his second season running UCLA Performing Arts swears he's
found gold. UCLA's new season is full of unusual work, in music,
dance and spoken word, but the theater festival is the boldest, the
most ambitious swath of 2002-03's offerings. Many of these
pieces--only a few can really be called plays--are non-narrative,
abstract works that rope several genres together at once.</LD>
<TE>   The festival--eight works that run from late September to early
December--includes a play about punk rock and the Dada movement
("Lipstick Traces"), a radically irreverent adaptation of Racine by
New York's avant-garde Wooster Group, and a version of "Woyzeck" with
music by Tom Waits. "Woyzeck," in fact, will be the first fully
staged work by Robert Wilson to come to Los Angeles; several of the
performances are exclusive U.S. engagements or West Coast premieres.
Although UCLA's offerings typically are staged in Royce Hall, most of
the theater festival will appear in the more intimate, 583-seat Freud
Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   For the festival's first year, Sefton is trying to define the term
"theater" as widely as possible. "I'm trying to nail my colors to the
mast to a certain extent, start to mark out the territory," says
Sefton, who recalls both the Manchester club owner in the film "24
Hour Party People" and a mad scientist. "And much of the work here
either is or was revolutionary."</TE>
<TE>   There's no question that the offerings are adventurous. The
question that remains, though, is whether people will come out for
theater--theater of the kind rarely seen in Los Angeles--in a town
that owes its fealty to the movies.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has a lot riding on the festival: About a quarter of
Performing Arts' $9.2-million budget--which covers 193 performances
of 86 productions--is devoted to these eight shows. Some signs are
good: "Woyzeck" has already become the second fastest-selling show of
the season, after Yo-Yo Ma's "Silk Road Project."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's season was born of Sefton's frequent flying: He spends
about half his time traveling the world. Over the last year, he saw
roughly 20 times more theater than he was able to book--not seeking
anything specific but hoping to be floored. "I've been looking to get
enthralled, excited and enthused enough," he says, "to want to go
through all the trouble it takes to bring a theater company to Los
Angeles." Don't look for anything that comes out of Eugene O'Neill's
line of heightened realism, any British work--ironic given Sefton's
origins and the torn-from-the-headlines plays currently galvanizing
the London stage--or much traditional storytelling. "I think there is
a lot of narrative theater in L.A. already," Sefton says. "I can't
really speak to the quality. But that's already here. When you say
theater to people in L.A., that's what they picture: actors shouting
at each other on stage, in an Elizabethan drawing room." (Next year's
theater festival, which he's already begun to book, includes more
narrative work.)</TE>
<TE>   The Wooster Group is renowned in hipster circles for its
deconstructing of familiar masterpieces and for graduating Willem
Dafoe and monologuist Spalding Gray. (Dafoe may appear in the group's
UCLA production of "To You, the Birdie!," which is based on Racine's
"Phedre.") Its method, evolved over a quarter century, is based on
distance, not emotional warmth.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind the Wooster Group's aesthetic is a distrust of--even a
contempt for--the theater's tendency to naturalistically depict human
feeling, and by doing so to evoke emotional responses in the
audience," Charles Isherwood wrote in a recent Daily Variety review
of the Racine piece, performed in Brooklyn. The Wooster gang, he
writes, "wants you to think about feelings, not feel them." The
Wooster Group is working in a venerable line of international theater
going back at least to Brecht and Beckett, but its iciness may not
appeal to a city whose culture tends toward more direct heat.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, October will offer the West Coast premiere of
"Hashirigaki" by German artist and composer Heiner Goebbels. Not only
has the piece never been performed on the West Coast, the work of
Goebbels--a serious, difficult figure whose music can be equal parts
sublime and assaultive--has rarely been performed in Los Angeles.
(The piece does have a California connection: Unlikely as it sounds,
its text was inspired in part by the Beach Boys.)</TE>
<TE>   Sefton has called the abstract, visually stirring Societas
Raffaello Sanzio "the best thing I've seen in 10 years." (The Italian
group, led by Romeo Castellucci, performs "Genesi," on Oct. 4-6, and
"Giulio Cesare," on Nov. 1-3.) But Societas Raffaello Sanzio has
never been to the United States. Its appearance here is a coup for
Sefton, but he can rely on very little name recognition from his
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Some arts observers aren't worried. "I anticipate that many of
these shows will sell out," says Lee Wochner, head of Theatre LA, a
service and advocacy organization for local theater. Difficult
material can work in Los Angeles, he says, like the Berliner
Ensemble's version of Brecht's "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui"
that went up at UCLA in '99. Wochner judged it "easily the most
exciting thing I've seen in a long time. I haven't forgotten Berliner
Ensemble--and it was in German." Wochner wasn't alone; the show he
saw was sold out. Overall, Wochner is pleased that the UCLA season is
dropping what he calls "the artificial boundaries" between theater
and the performing arts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if they don't make it in L.A., I don't know where they
will make it," Robert Cole, director of Cal Performances in Berkeley
and a former Angeleno, says of the shows. "There's such a big
potential audience for it with all those small theaters." Cole admits
he's a little envious of the UCLA schedule, especially its ability to
inhabit a variety of spaces. (Most of Cal Performances' pieces go up
in UC Berkeley's 2,000-seat Zellerbach Hall.) "A lot of the things
he's doing I wanted to do, but didn't have the theater." The key to
helping risky material find its audience, Cole says, is catching fire
in the press and offering runs long enough to allow word of mouth to
build over a week or more. "And the artists. They've got to deliver."</TE>
<TE>   Dean Corey, executive director of the Philharmonic Society of
Orange County and programmer of the Eclectic Orange Festival, says
anyone trying to bring non-narrative theater to L.A. faces sizable
challenges. "It seems that local theater is either small and
experimental, or large and dreaming of Tonys, with nothing in
between," he says via e-mail from Austria's Salzburg Festival. "If
L.A. is to be taken seriously on the culture map, new theater must be
regularly on the menu. It will only happen if places like UCLA make
it and keep it happening. Eventually there will be an audience and we
will all be better for it."</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, UCLA could create a link between touring groups
new to California and West Coast audiences. Harvey Lichtenstein ran
the Brooklyn Academy of Music for more than 30 years, establishing a
famous house style and building the careers of major avant-garde
artists. It's no secret that BAM is the presenter Sefton most wants
to emulate. But when Lichtenstein took over at BAM in 1967 and began
importing talent--Wilson, composer Steve Reich, choreographer Merce
Cunningham--for performances and residencies, most of them were
obscure names or young upstarts at best.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough," says Lichtenstein. "My major theater was a
2,000-seat opera house, and we put Merce Cunningham in there and he
would draw 400 people, 500 people. It was a matter of sticking with
the genre. It took a long time, and a lot of perseverance and a lot
of heartache." Sometimes it worked--as with Reich's "Drumming," from
1975, now a canonical piece--other times it didn't. "We did an
extraordinary production of [Federico Garcia Lorca's] 'Yerma' in the
early '70s, done on a trampoline, a stunning production. It didn't
catch on. And that's happened with other things that I've thought
were terrific."</TE>
<TE>   Sefton's first foray into theater at UCLA was the chilling
plane-crash drama "Charlie Victor Romeo," which ran in the summer of
2000. Since then he's offered works by Robert Lepage ("The Far Side
of the Moon"), da da kamera ("In on It") and Theatre de Complicite
("The Noise of Time"). The theater offerings sold, on average,
three-quarters of the available seats, according to UCLA Performing
Arts, with demand building after strong reviews or word-of-mouth. He
says he's feeling less resistance than he detected when he arrived at
UCLA. "I think it's clear now," Sefton says, "that I'm not gonna burn
down Royce Hall and build a rock stadium."</TE>

<HD>Beck the Writer Takes a Bow</HD>
<DH>After outings in R&amp;B and folk/hip-hop, the artist returns
with a highly personal album taking cues from the lonesome poetry of
Hank Williams</DH>

<LD>There's a basketball hoop on the garage of Beck's two-story house in
Silver Lake, but he warns against trying to drive hard for a layup.
The driveway slants down, which means you'll end up crashing into the
garage door.</LD>
<LD>   Another problem with the hoop, which he had installed shortly
after he moved in, is that the garage is so close to the street that
the ball can easily bounce off the rim and roll down the hillside
avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The restrictions force him to be cautious when acting out any
Michael Jordan fantasies, but there's nothing timid about Beck's
music. In fact, some industry observers feel Beck's last album,
1999's "Midnite Vultures," was a sign that he is a bit too
adventurous..</LD>
<TE>   The album, in which the folk/hip-hop wizard behind 1996's
Grammy-winning "Odelay" album switched into the role of a modern-day
soul man, was generally cheered by critics. Radio programmers and
most of "Odelay's" fans, however, just shook their heads in
confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Was Beck making fun of R&amp;B (absolutely not) or was he just out of
sync with public expectations and taste (possibly)?</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, the frightfully prolific musician has been largely
silent since "Vultures," suggesting his confidence might have been
shaken by the experience.</TE>
<TE>   The 32-year-old singer-songwriter did go through a period of
uncertainty before returning with a new album. The delay, though, had
nothing to do with the reaction to "Vultures," which, he points out,
was far better received in Europe than "Odelay."</TE>
<TE>   He simply felt the songs on the new "Sea Change" album, due Sept.
24 from Geffen Records, were uncomfortably personal. They dealt with
the break-up of a longtime relationship with clothing designer Leigh
Limon, and he worried that the sometimes painfully introspective
songs might be seen as an exercise in self-pity. It was almost two
years before he was ready to commit the music to disc.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been asking for years, 'Do you ever write things that
are more personal?' and I always said, 'Yeah, I do,' but I resisted
recording those songs," Beck says in his living room overlooking the
Silver Lake Reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started out, I had this idea about making music for other
people to enjoy. I didn't want it to be all about me. After writing
these songs, I also worried that they would be seen as a plea for
sympathy or something. I needed time to make sure I could look at
them clearly."</TE>
<TE>   Beck felt comfortable with the songs by last fall, but his plans
to go into the studio were interrupted by Sept. 11. He worried this
time that the dark, melancholy themes might be too solemn.</TE>
<TE>   In February, however, Beck went into the studio with producer
Nigel Godrich, who had worked with him on 1998's "Mutations" album
and with Radiohead on 1997's "OK Computer." Recording at Beck's
16-hour-a-day pace, they completed the basic tracks in just two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I saw that the album wouldn't just be some meaningless
ego thing, that the themes were universal," Beck says. "That's when
the record started to make sense."</TE>
<TE>   His decision was wise--"Sea Change" may just be the most
compelling album so far this year, rivaled only by Eminem's "The
Eminem Show."</TE>
<TE>   The album arrives at what may be a pivotal time of reappraisal in
pop music--a time when rock 'n' roll is returning to its passionate
roots after years of drab, anonymous sounds and when, ideally,
songwriting may be making a comeback in a wider pop arena after so
much emphasis on producer-created hits. (See story, Page 9.)</TE>
<TE>   Of all these new singer-songwriter packages, Beck's may have the
greatest influence on the tone of pop music because the Los Angeles
native is the kind of artist that others take their cue from. The
fact that he hasn't been primarily associated with the
singer-songwriter movement may cause heads to turn even more.</TE>
<TE>   His "Sea Change" album is a work of remarkable power whose best
moments speak of such emotions as isolation and disillusionment, with
the economy, honesty and beauty of Hank Williams, the great country
singer and songwriter who was a key inspiration on the album.</TE>
<TE>   In the opening song, the country-tinged "The Golden Age," Beck
describes being so thrown off stride that you seek anything, even
just the cool night air through the car window, to make you feel
alive. "These days I barely get by," he sings in a voice barely above
a whisper. "I don't even try."</TE>
<TE>   Things get darker from there, but they eventually start
brightening. As is so often the case with music, there is something
healing and hopeful about hearing someone's struggle, even if it's
just from marveling at the way a performer can turn anguish into art.</TE>
<TE>   Beck has made other traditional singer-songwriter albums,
including "Mutations" and 1994's "One Foot in the Grave," but they
were presented as career sidesteps and lacked the straightforwardness
of the new one. His "official" albums have been the ones with more
contemporary settings, from 1994's "Mellow Gold," which had his
breakthrough hit, "Loser," to "Vultures."</TE>
<TE>   Beck may still move in mysterious ways musically. He's been
working on a punk-rock exercise that could surface as an album. At a
time when most pop artists seem to have their eyes only on the sales
charts, Beck is one of the few major figures with an eye on the long
run. Like Neil Young, Tom Waits and Bob Dylan, he doesn't deny his
artistic impulses just because they may momentarily lead him away
from the commercial pack.</TE>
<TE>   "Sea Change," however, is a pure celebration of the
singer-songwriter experience, and it's good that he's releasing it as
a real Beck album, with the accompanying record label promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Fans have always marveled at his ability to mix 'n' match styles
in ways both soulful and experimental, but his sheer cleverness was
often a large part of the process. In "Sea Change," the lure is his
heartfelt honesty and pure craft.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that some artists prefer to go in a straight trajectory
and I respect that," he says, sipping bottled water three days after
his solo acoustic tour ended with a concert at the Wadsworth Theatre,
where he previewed most of the "Sea Change" songs to an enthusiastic
audience. (He returns to the road next month with a tour that
includes a Nov. 25 stop at the Universal Amphitheatre with the band
Flaming Lips.)</TE>
<TE>   "I think they make it a lot easier on themselves, but there's a
price you pay for it," he continues. "They sit in one place for so
long that they almost become a statue. The way I've done it is a lot
more work and it's hard for people not to get confused. Fans came to
the acoustic show and they asked where was the horn section. But I
think that price you pay is worth keeping the creativity alive."</TE>
<TE>   Beck has wide-ranging musical tastes--he's stepped on stage with
artists as varied as Brazil's Caetano Veloso, a leader in the
Tropicalia movement, and Jack White, the blues-inspired
singer-songwriter of rockers the White Stripes. He can talk with
equal enthusiasm of hip-hop pioneer Grandmaster Flash and art-rockers
Devo.</TE>
<TE>   So his experimentation with various styles comes naturally. In
"Sea Change," however, Beck focuses solely on his singer-songwriter
heritage. The songs' tones are brightened by stylish instrumental
touches, but the spotlight is always on his words and voice.</TE>
<TE>   There's a three-song sequence early in the album--"Guess I'm Doing
Fine," "Lonesome Tears" and "Lost Cause"--that together make up the
sound of a man's emotions hitting bottom.</TE>
<TE>   In the first, the narrator is so bruised emotionally he can't even
hear the songs a bluebird is singing outside his window--an apparent
tip of the hat to Williams' reference to a lonesome whippoorwill in
his influential 1949 composition "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry."</TE>
<TE>   "I still go back and listen to Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers
all the time," Beck says. "The thing that is so amazing about
Williams is simplicity. He was so disciplined and so economical.
There was no filter on his emotions."</TE>
<TE>   In "Lonesome Tears," Beck conveys those same qualities as a
writer, and his singing has never been more convincing:</TE>
<TE>   I can't cry them anymore</TE>
<TE>   I can't think of what they're for</TE>
<TE>   O they ruin me every time.</TE>
<TE>   Beck may finally feel comfortable writing about the end of his
relationship, but he's not about to start talking about the details.
He may have tipped off his own anxiety in an interview we did around
the time of "Midnite Vultures."</TE>
<TE>   "There are periods in a musician's life where you don't have a day
off for months," he said, discussing the strain his 24/7 musical
dedication put on his relationship at the time. "I know that can be
frustrating for those around you. I'd like to spend some time with
friends who I have been neglecting for the last year and a half."</TE>
<TE>   He sighs when I read the quote back to him, but he's clearly not
going any further into the breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't talk about my personal life much, never did," he says. "I
guess maybe it was just the way I was raised. I don't ever want to
become fodder for the world's tabloid satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides, I don't think it's necessary for anybody to know my
story to understand the album. This kind of stuff happens to
everybody. I never thought there was anything special about what I
was going through. I was always focused on the music."</TE>
<TE>   Another reason Beck doesn't want to talk about the past is that
he's in a good place now in his life. He was just 24 when "Loser"
made him a pop-culture sensation--overnight, it seemed, he was the
media's favorite Gen-X subject. His blank, boyish look even fit the
role, although there was nothing else about him that met the
definition of slacker. Rather than aimless and apathetic, he worked
with an obsession rarely seen in pop.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the waif-like innocence has been replaced by a more
confident and outgoing demeanor. His face has started to take on more
mature, expressive features.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I am very comfortable these days, both with the way my
career is going and my life," he says. "I think it takes time to
adjust to this kind of life. Nobody ever hands you the textbook on
how to act. I see a lot of young bands out trying to burn the candle,
trying to sample everything, and I understand what that's about.</TE>
<TE>   "But you gradually see what's important and what excites you and
that is far more satisfying. That's another reason that made me feel
comfortable with these songs. At the end of the album, I think you
can sense that you can find strength even though the floor just came
out from under you."</TE>

<HD>A Young Gun Yearning to Move Forward</HD>
<DH>Wary of being categorized, Brit David Eldridge sees an L.A.
production as an important step</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At only 28, playwright David Eldridge is an old hand at being a "new
talent." Hailed in a recent London Guardian article headlined "Who's
Who in New British Theatre," it was not the first but the second time
in Eldridge's young career that the U.K. media had deemed him part of
the latest wave.</LD>
<LD>   "My first play was at the Bush Theatre in West London when I was
22, and it had some considerable success," recalls the quietly
well-mannered writer. He was referring to the 1996 debut of "Serving
It Up," which featured a world of disaffected youth not unlike the
young heroin addicts in the film "Trainspotting," which came out the
same year. "So I was called part of the angry, urban,
twentysomething, ennui 'Trainspotting' generation back then."</LD>
<LD>   Since produced at such noted British venues as the Donmar
Warehouse and the Royal Court Theatre, Eldridge made his American
debut at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts last year
with "Under the Blue Sky." The same play opens at the Geffen
Playhouse on Wednesday, staged by Geffen producing director Gilbert
Cates, and starring Sharon Lawrence and Willie Garson.</LD>
<TE>   Eldridge is under commission to the Bush Theatre, the Royal Court
Theatre and BBC Radio. Yet he remains ambivalent about whether he's
part of any wave. "The thing that I feel about being in those
articles, ultimately, is that I bear some sort of responsibility,"
Eldridge says during a recent visit to Los Angeles. "It's an
opportunity for me to say what I believe in and what I think might be
better.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a bit of me that thinks this is a lovely compliment, and
there's another bit of me that kind of feels like I don't want to
take it too seriously," he continues. "I think ultimately the work
has to speak for itself."</TE>
<TE>   Eldridge is hopeful that his latest effort will be allowed to
stand on its own, particularly because it's so different from the
piece with which he made his breakthrough. An exploration of intimacy
among three different pairs of teachers, "Under the Blue Sky" is the
first play that Cates has chosen to direct at the Geffen since 1999's
"Collected Stories."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fearless play," Cates says. "It's remarkable in terms of
its maturity and its depth. David goes to dark places that are
uncomfortable and necessary to pursue to understand life. It's
remarkable to me that a young man has the life experience that's
necessary to tell these stories. David's attempt is to explore a part
of our human psyche that doesn't have light thrown on it often, a
part that deals with our fears and our sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a play about seizing the day, taking advantage of
opportunity when it presents itself, and about luck and timing,"
Cates continues. "It's about how in relationships when one person's
ready and the other's not, and how things work out simply because of
timing and the willingness of one person to say, even though the
timing doesn't seem right, 'I'm going to do it.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Eldridge completed "Under the Blue Sky" in 1999, he had a
very different idea of what the piece was about. "What was really
strong for me in it was that it was about the importance of personal
responsibility," he says. Now his ideas about the play's themes sound
much more like Cates' interpretation--hardly a coincidence,
considering that director and writer have been working together for
many weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I think that it's much more about connection," says Eldridge,
whose puppyish face, even with glasses, belies his frequently edgy
writing. "You miss the boat so often in life. Things don't work out,
because you're not ready and you don't know who you are, and when it
happens it just fits wrong."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he's talking about more than just personal relationships.
"I read this quote in a book about patterns in history repeating
itself," he says. "Then I thought about friends of mine that were in
bad relationships. People get into cycles in their relationships."</TE>
<TE>   As a writer, he looks for connections between public events and
personal lives. "That was really interesting for me, thinking about
the last century and those patterns in history and conflict and the
personal relationships," he continues. "I saw a really clear link
between them. For me, there's a strong, clear and deep link in the
first act of the play between a bomb going off and a young woman
feeling so angry and upset."</TE>
<TE>   In an intellectual gesture more common among British than American
writers, Eldridge connects the dots between the personal and the
political. "If I hadn't done English and drama at university, I would
have done history and politics," the Exeter graduate says. "I think
that in my writing, it's just natural that it's that way, that there
is the personal and the political.</TE>
<TE>   "I like finding resonance for society through interpersonal
relationships or through metaphors that you explore in a play,"
Eldridge says. "I think that's what's important to me."</TE>
<TE>   Eldridge's writing about relationships is informed by a typically
British class-consciousness, heightened by his proletarian origins.
"I think it's inevitable, to a certain extent, given what my
background and experience is," Eldridge says. "I had a very
schizophrenic upbringing. My dad was a shoemaker, and my mum didn't
work. There was no other money coming into the house."</TE>
<TE>   Raised in the working-class suburb of Romford, outside London,
Eldridge's first job as a schoolboy was selling shoes in an open-air
market stall. His ticket to a better life came in the form of a
scholarship to a private school. Despite the fact that he felt out of
place among his wealthy classmates, Eldridge describes his private
schooling as a generally positive experience. Indeed, it was during
those years that he discovered the love of theater that would lead
him to his vocation.</TE>
<TE>   While at Exeter, he began writing plays, and he hasn't stopped.
Indeed, his first few plays came fast and easy. "I didn't really
think about how I wrote them, I just kind of wrote them," Eldridge
says of his early work. "I had a story to tell and a great passion
for it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the process of writing "Under the Blue Sky" turned out to be
very different. Eldridge began with nothing more than a world from
which he knew his characters would emerge.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that I wanted to write about teachers," he says. "I've got
quite a few friends who are schoolteachers. I've been listening to
them gossip about their colleagues' sex lives for years--who doesn't
like whom and who wants to move on and all kinds of office politics."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from interpersonal conflicts, there was a deeper concern
that the playwright found compelling. "It's the ultimate reinvestment
back in society," Eldridge says of teaching. "I wanted to write a
play that explored the gap between the people that we are and the
people that we wish we could be, and there's something about teaching
and education that throws that idea directly back with your
subjects--teachers. But what you're writing about is teachers as
human beings, where they become complex, and they're as strange and
complex as anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of this complicated subtext, it took Eldridge
longer than usual to decide how to structure his play. He ended up
with three separate yet interwoven narratives.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me a long time to write 'Under the Blue Sky,' " says
Eldridge, who spent about two years completing the piece. "A lot of
that time was searching around for a way to tell the story. It's the
first time I wrote a play that I really thought that I've got a
choice now about how I tell the story. That's not diminishing any of
the other plays that I've written. I just think that I wrote them in
a different way."</TE>
<TE>   Then, too, it could simply be a sign of his maturation as a
writer. "Under the Blue Sky" was hailed by the Daily Telegraph in
London as a new level of achievement: "First-class new plays are few
and far between, but when they appear they send your spirits soaring.
Just such a heavenly piece of writing is the latest by 27-year-old
David Eldridge."</TE>
<TE>   Looking forward, Eldridge hopes to push toward more new
challenges. "I'd like to write for a bigger company of actors, to try
that out for a couple of plays," he says. "So the play I'm writing
for the Royal Court, which is actually what I've been spending most
of the last year on, is for eight actors."</TE>
<TE>   The piece is inspired by his '80s experiences selling women's
shoes in an outdoor market. "There was this bunch of wild teenagers,"
he recalls. "We were just out of control, these kids running around,
with petty crime and everything."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Eldridge is also in the midst of six months as
playwright-in-residence at the London advertising agency TBWA/GGT.
He's helping employees try their hands at playwriting, and the Soho
Theatre, which is sponsored by TBWA/GGT, will receive a play inspired
by the world of advertising in 2003-04. "They were suspicious of me
at first," Eldridge says of his ad agency office mates. "But I'm
becoming their friend now, which is great."</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, however, he is thrilled to be working with Cates
in Los Angeles. It's a long way from Romford and a big step forward.
"I've had success in London as a kind of an up-and-coming playwright,
and so I was frustrated slightly that the plays hadn't traveled
beyond their immediate context," Eldridge says, looking back, once
again, on the mixed blessing of being a recurrent flavor of the week.
"It feels really nice to have written something that is speaking
beyond its immediate context."</TE>

<LD>Sometime in late spring, the mailings start to arrive: season
announcements from area theaters, providing a range of shows for
nearly every taste. Usually there's a familiar name on the
roster--maybe a playwright or a production, an actor or a director.
Often there's a world premiere or a local premiere. Occasionally,
there's a classic. Always there are surprises. For some venues, the
season has already started; for others, September marks the beginning
of the year. In scanning the rosters, many people wonder how these
shows were selected. Is there a magical formula involved in putting
together a season? We asked the decision-makers at five theaters to
share how they made selections.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Imagine planning six fabulous dinner parties over the course of
the year. In this case, the guest list will number in the thousands
(all of our subscribers and a huge number of single-ticket buyers).
And those who come to dine on our theatrical fare will have a vast
array of tastes and preferences. I hope to please them all.</LD>
<TE>   I know this is an impossible task. But it is my job to put
together six evenings that will stimulate heart, body and soul. That
is how I think of planning the season for the Pasadena Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of the year, I hope to entice our audiences with a
bill of theatrical fare that is eclectic, diverse, satisfying and
often surprising. I would like each meal to be different from the
last, with something to appeal to every kind of palate. I hope our
theatrical year will introduce some to spices and flavors they have
never tried before.</TE>
<TE>   And I believe that the quality of the meals we are offering at our
theater is such that even the previously unknown theatrical cuisine
will be appealing.</TE>
<TE>   I hope that the guests at the table will be as interesting and
diverse as the menu. And so the season is chosen with an eye toward
attracting an audience of diversity. Certainly I hope that our guests
will be of all colors, but also of all ages and of varying social and
economic backgrounds. The after-dinner conversation is always so much
more lively when the guest list has been widespread. (God save me
from the dinner party where everyone looks, thinks and feels the same
way.) I want the conversations in the courtyard after a performance
to be the result of stimulation, provocation and even disagreement.</TE>
<TE>   That is what makes for an exciting after-dinner drink, and that is
what makes a theater that is healthy, alive and vital.</TE>
<TE>   The factors that go into the choice of the season sometimes seem
almost endless. They include availability of rights, budgetary
considerations, marketing issues, the long-term artistic vision of
the theater, and, somewhere in there, even my own personal tastes and
desires (which may, for example, give life to our current production,
"Blue," or next year's revival of "House of Flowers," a musical that
I have longed to bring to the playhouse stage for years).</TE>
<TE>   I certainly must bow to many of those demands and considerations.
But first and foremost, I try to guarantee that the bill of fare at
this theater will be interesting enough to both fill you up and also
leave you longing for more.</TE>
<TE>   I sometimes think of playwrights as chefs in the kitchen. And what
a brilliant group of writers the playhouse has in the coming season.
Included in the mix are the wit, sophistication and elegance of Noel
Coward's "Star Quality" (a North American premiere); Gary Socol's
biting humor in a very funny play about depression, "Bicoastal
Woman"; and writer-director James Still seasons his play "Looking
Over the President's Shoulder" with a liberal dose of historical fact
mixed with a moving emotional and deeply personal perspective on the
presidency that is strongly resonant in our country's current state
of affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Fine meals indeed. Diverse, rich, and very tasty!</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At a recent Wednesday-morning staff meeting for the 2002 World
Festival of Sacred Music, the main topic is how to get the world of
Southern California to come to the world of sacred music.</LD>
<LD>   The woman in charge, intercultural guru Judy Mitoma, asks for the
latest developments from the communications front. She speaks softly
but firmly, her bright eyes and incipient smile inviting all
contributions. One publicist proudly reports that a newspaper has
decided to feature two specific concerts in small "pick" items, maybe
with photographs.</LD>
<LD>   This ostensibly good news is met with a crushed look from Mitoma.
"But we want to be inclusive," she says. "What about the other 53
events?"</LD>
<TE>   Herein lies just a small indication of the optimism, ambition and
demanding nature of the relentlessly inclusive Mitoma, director of
the World Festival of Sacred Music, which began Saturday. Around the
table in a basement conference room at the Fowler Museum at UCLA,
where the festival shares space with Mitoma's Center for
Intercultural Performance, there is a moment of silence.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more than one person is thinking about the way things work
in the publicizing business--mainly that star power sells. Or else
they're already converted to Mitoma's belief that if you promise
musical adventure and communal togetherness, they will come, even if
they've never heard of Lifou Island and its dancers or can't define
the word "gamelan." In Mitoma's words, people should come because "it
will be good."</TE>
<TE>   Everything will be good?</TE>
<TE>   "Everything," Mitoma insists after the meeting. "It's not about
celebrity concerts, it's about stepping into territory where you'll
encounter something different, something about our city and about
yourself."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the first World Festival of Sacred Music got a public
relations boost from no less a star than the Dalai Lama.</TE>
<TE>   In Dharamsala, India, his holiness publicly called sacred
music--music that expresses inner yearnings for peace in all
cultures--an appropriate way to usher in the new millennium. In
Westwood, Mitoma heard the call and, bingo, a few organizational
nightmares later, a whole festival came together in October.</TE>
<TE>   Word of mouth was good, even ecstatic. The Dalai Lama brought his
glow to several events, and there were reports of musically magical
moments and supremely optimistic connectedness--some of them from
critics.</TE>
<TE>   After a few precarious financial moments in 1999, the festival not
only broke even, but also realized a small profit. Still, the size of
the thing--84 events in nine days--and the budget perils took their
toll on organizers' nerves. Mitoma took a year or so afterward to
think about whether to tackle a second edition.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, she says it was audience enthusiasm at a showing of a
festival video in 2001 that persuaded her to do it all again. Just
over a year ago, staffers were hired, and Mitoma and her fellow
founding board members--environmental activist Andrew Beath of the
Earthways Foundation, and fund-raiser Jodie Evans--started planning
in earnest.</TE>
<TE>   A few lessons had been learned along the way. For all the goodwill
engendered in 1999, people complained that there were too many
competing events. With the budget set at slightly under the $1
million it took last time, it was decided that in 2002 there would be
more time to take in fewer events.</TE>
<TE>   To create the program, local artists and presenters were invited
to orientation meetings and asked to submit proposals, as they had
been in 1999. Mitoma and others also sent out feelers to performers
from around the world. When videos and applications rolled in, they
were screened by Mitoma and her staff, then a selection went to a
curatorial panel for the final cut. They kept three things in mind as
they considered how well different candidates fit with their criteria
for sacred music: Did it come from a particular spiritual tradition?
Were there sacred words used? Did it give those in the room a feeling
of the spiritual or sacred?</TE>
<TE>   The process didn't avoid stars, but it didn't emphasize them
either. There are some famous names, like the Whirling Dervishes of
Damascus and the L.A. Philharmonic, which will play the Mozart
Requiem at the new cathedral, and qawwali singer Rahat Nusrat Fateh
Ali Khan. But then there is also that gamelan--which is a Balinese
"orchestra" of bells, gongs and xylophones. In this case, it's called
Cudamani and directed by Mitoma's son-in-law, I Dewa Putu Berata.</TE>
<TE>   The festival seems to specialize in a mix of seemingly disparate
groups performing side by side. In 1999, there was a gospel choir
jamming with cantors at a synagogue. This time, programs bring
together African, Japanese, jazz and Native American drummers at the
Watts Towers, and, in San Pedro, a joyful noise from Jewish,
Christian, African and Bolivian traditions at the Warner Theater.</TE>
<TE>   In all there are 55 events, over 16 days, in 43 venues all over
greater Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Since the countdown to the festival began, Mitoma's schedule has
consisted of wall-to-wall meetings, negotiations and problem-solving.
The early mornings have recently been devoted to making room in her
own Mar Vista garage to store the gamelan instruments. It's not
unusual for her workday to stretch until nearly midnight.</TE>
<TE>   No one, least of all Mitoma, shows panic at the morning meeting
just a few weeks before the festival begins. She calmly sails through
details, many of which reveal the festival's grass-roots sensibility.
Mitoma asks everyone to contribute list-servs from friends and
colleagues, so that the Internet's power can spread the word.</TE>
<TE>   Then people report where brochures will be handed out, at
community gatherings over Labor Day, at farmers markets during the
week, at hotels and record stores. Mitoma reports that invitations
for a VIP reception before the Royce concert are being mailed as soon
as they come out of the color printer next to her desk--a
cost-cutting measure she's proud of.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere is cautiously cheerful, but before the 90-minute
meeting is over and people scatter to their after-meeting meetings, a
negative cloud threatens. Two prominent public radio stations have
rejected coverage of the festival. This calls for another of Mitoma's
many shifts into inspirational-speaker mode. "Make a case for
coverage, don't hold back," she advises. "Only good things will come
from your efforts. I can't understand why they wouldn't want to cover
it." She looks genuinely perplexed.</TE>
<TE>   In the dance community and around the UCLA department of world
arts and cultures, which Mitoma founded and where she now teaches and
runs a variety of projects, Mitoma is known as a person who walks
softly and carries a big grant. The soft part describes her
philosophy of human interconnectedness and her ability to articulate
it in melodious and dedicated tones. The grant part is simple, she
explains. "It's hard work, just very hard work--there's no smoke and
mirrors."</TE>
<TE>   She discovered she liked hard work early in life when she helped
her father, a wholesale produce man, load bushels of tomatoes in
South Los Angeles. But she admits that it takes more than long hours
and hefting to make things happen as an adult.</TE>
<TE>   "It's being practical, it's being grounded," she says, "but it's
also being engaged with a higher level of ideas, and not being
discouraged by the obstacles you encounter. You need to be alert and
seize an opportunity and know how to bring out the best in people."</TE>
<TE>   An idea whose time has come doesn't hurt either, and most of
Mitoma's projects have arisen from her interest in inclusion, which
put her on the leading edge of an evolving multicultural era.</TE>
<TE>   Mitoma got her first small grant and a taste for organizing events
when she was a UCLA undergrad. She produced a world dance concert
that was a contrast to the steady diet of ballet and modern
performances common then.</TE>
<TE>   She researched festivals for her academic work, and developed a
sense of how they functioned. "I was very critical all the time," she
remembers, "learning about the operations, but maybe not liking the
way the audience was treated or the way the artists were presented."</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, she worked with Peter Sellars on the Olympic Arts
Festival and the now-defunct L.A. Festival, his all-over-town,
multicultural event. She has tried to keep the grass-roots flavor of
that festival, which ran in 1987, 1990 and 1993, without repeating
the budget problems and internecine warfare that often accompanied
it.</TE>
<TE>   But a few festival crises seem inevitable. Mitoma's afternoon is
marred by news of a travel visa denied to a performer in one of the
troupes (many visas are in limbo). Then, she hears that one staffer
is overwhelmed with ticket distribution dilemmas, so she pulls her in
and makes a list of ways to spread the work among more people. She
reads copy for program notes and decides there should be more about
the artists' lives.</TE>
<TE>   By 7 p.m., she is at home, but the day isn't finished. Mitoma
lives alone, long divorced, with both her children grown. Her house
has traditionally been open to whomever she's working with. This
evening, Beath is bringing over two eager filmmakers to sit amid the
masks, puppets and Asian artwork in her living room and discuss a
possible festival documentary.</TE>
<TE>   It's nearly 10 p.m. when this last official meeting breaks up.
Mitoma takes a moment to water her lawn; when she returns, the
festival director and her fellow board member will keep working,
confabbing over a late dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone involved in the World Festival of Sacred Music knows its
goals can sound impossibly idealistic. That doesn't bother the
organizers at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you've got an overarching theme and ethic, you've just got
performances and entertainment," Beath says. "What we're trying to do
is provide a festival for particular purposes--community building,
getting over racial barriers, learning about other people. If
idealism turns people off, I think they should come to the festival
and maybe it will affect them a little bit, too."</TE>
<TE>   Mitoma has given some thought to what it means to lead a festival
that engages the concept of the sacred. She often reads Buddhist
teachings at bedtime, but says, "I'm not a flag-waving Buddhist. It's
about attitude and philosophy, how to be kind to people, about how to
hear and see what they're going through rather than be focused on
what I want them to do."</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't she run into a clash between that attitude and the one
that says "This is due at 5 o'clock"?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," she says, laughing and nodding. "It's not easy. But if we
cannot treat each other in a way that's like our goal in the
festival, then it's all insincere."</TE>
<TE>   After all, she says, "we're all together in this enterprise," and
it's not clear for a moment if she means the enterprise of life or
the festival. For her, the two are intimately intertwined. "We're
sitting alongside each other, accepting and feeling part of something
bigger. I think that's a huge accomplishment."</TE>

they'll introduce work unknown to Americans</DH>

<LD>Producers of the third annual Latin Grammy telecast, which CBS is
broadcasting from the Kodak Theatre on Wednesday, must have been
scrambling these past few weeks for big-name presenters to boost the
ratings. They even trotted out those old standbys Gloria Estefan and
Jimmy Smits as co-hosts for the prime-time show, which aims to honor
the best in Latin music.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the problem this year is the scarcity of superstar names
among the major nominees--at least, the crossover kind of superstar,
like Ricky Martin or Enrique Iglesias, most familiar to American
audiences.</LD>
<LD>   Colombian vallenato singer Carlos Vives, who garnered a
field-leading six nominations in this year's competition, is a
respectable contender but hardly a ratings heavyweight.</LD>
<TE>   For really exciting prime-time appeal, producers were lucky to tap
Shakira for a scheduled performance. The Colombian singer-songwriter
is nominated for her video of "Suerte," the Spanish version of
"Whenever, Wherever" from her hit album "Laundry Service." The album
itself, however, is not in the running because it's mostly in
English. To qualify for a Latin Grammy, the first international
version of the prestigious music award, an album must be at least 51%
in Spanish or Portuguese. (The eligibility release period is April 1,
2000 to March 31, 2002.)</TE>
<TE>   The celebrity search may be a dilemma for those who worry about TV
ratings. The good news is that in some categories at least, the Latin
Grammy voters don't really seem to care how their choices play on the
tube in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly half of them don't even live here. The U.S. still has the
largest voting block in the Miami-based Latin Academy of Recording
Arts &amp; Sciences, with a tad more than 50% of its nearly 4,000
members. The rest are spread across Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Argentina,
Colombia and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   That geographical diversity makes for some pleasant surprises for
music lovers, especially in this year's pop music categories. Many of
the pop nominees aren't just unexpected--they're totally unknown
here.</TE>
<TE>   The only practical way to hear some of this excellent music, much
of it coming from Spain, is to schedule a private listening session
at the Grammy offices in Santa Monica. The awards organizers there
keep a copy of each nominated album, works you will never see in your
local music stores.</TE>
<TE>   That means most people will never hear the mature brilliance of
Spain's Ana Belen, the celestial vocals of Chile's Cecilia Echenique
and the searing social insight of Uruguay's Jorge Drexler.</TE>
<TE>   That's assuming the public cared to discover something new. Too
many people have been conditioned by commercial Spanish radio to
think that all Latin pop is Paulina Rubio and Luis Miguel.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for those who want to look beyond the big celebrities and
the TV glitz, the Latin Grammys have become a credible guide to
sampling the undiscovered side of Latin music. With the Internet,
fans can easily access this enormous and endlessly fascinating realm
of hidden treasures. Almost all of the international nominees have
Web sites, as do their labels.</TE>
<TE>   In the regular Grammys, handicapping the contenders and predicting
the winners has become an annual sport. In the Latin Grammys, that
game becomes a much more risky bet.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, the Latin music awards don't have enough of a
history to establish a voting trend. But more important, the
membership is too scattered and too much in flux to act as a cohesive
group with predictable tastes and prejudices.</TE>
<TE>   "The membership is very spread out and it's very hard to tell how
people in Spain will respond to an artist from Argentina," says
Enrique Fernandez, executive director of the Latin Academy. "I think
it's a very, very tough call."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it doesn't take a soothsayer to weigh the relative chances
of artists nominated in major categories.</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind these three names in the top three categories: Vives,
Cruz and Sanz.</TE>
<TE>   All three--Colombia's Vives, Cuba's Celia Cruz and Spain's
Alejandro Sanz--are nominated for record, album and song of the year.
And all three are favorites in the U.S. Latin market, with
significant domestic label support.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are good that one of them will walk away a big winner.</TE>
<TE>   Vives launched the vallenato craze in the early '90s with his
smash Latin club hit "La Gota Fria." He subsequently slipped into a
commercial, though not creative, slump.</TE>
<TE>   The dynamic performer is experiencing a comeback with his latest
album, "Dejame Entrar" (Let Me In), whose title cut has two major
nominations. The marketing savvy of Miami producer Emilio Estefan Jr.
gave Vives another hit--and a good chance at a Latin Grammy victory,
which honors clout as much as artistry.</TE>
<TE>   Artistically, Vives deserved every accolade for his 1997
masterpiece "Tengo Fe," a complex and uplifting album that got almost
no attention. His new work falls far short, especially the title cut
with its calculated pop appeal and routine romantic theme. But the
rest of the album still reflects some of the earthy, skin-tingling
excitement of Colombia's coastal music.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, the so-called Queen of Salsa, will be a sentimental favorite
with her latest work, "La Negra Tiene Tumbao," which means something
like "that black woman's got the groove." There's something slightly
undignified in this album's attempt to make Cruz sound hip and
modern, with rap and timba thrown into her salsa mix.</TE>
<TE>   But voters are likely to find it endearing that this salsa elder
has a contemporary dance hit more than half a century into her
career. They won't know, or care, that her once robust vocals have
noticeably weakened with age (which she never reveals).</TE>
<TE>   Sanz was the big winner in last year's ill-fated Latin Grammys,
whose presentation was canceled after the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11. The unassuming singer-songwriter won four awards for his album,
"El Alma Al Aire."</TE>
<TE>   He's nominated again for some of those same songs, this time
performed live for his "MTV Unplugged" album. One song that appears
on a previous album--"Y Solo Se Me Occure Amarte"--is nominated this
year for both song and record of the year.</TE>
<TE>   We trust voters won't be fooled by retreads, no matter how
improved the new acoustic versions may be.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the other contenders in the top fields.</TE>
<TE>   Record of the Year</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, Sanz and Vives are competing here with two lesser-known
challengers--new Peruvian singer-songwriter Gian Marco and veteran
Chilean rockers La Ley.</TE>
<TE>   Like Vives', Gian Marco's album comes out of the Estefan shop,
where he worked as a writer. His romantic pop material sounds fresh
and the arrangements are nicely textured with folkloric
instrumentation.</TE>
<TE>   La Ley has the least interesting entry, with another "MTV
Unplugged" concert.</TE>
<TE>   Album of the Year</TE>
<TE>   What a pleasure to see Brazilian singer Ivan Lins appear here with
"Jobiniando," his sophisticated bossa-style album whose title cut is
a tribute to Antonio Carlos Jobim. The Brazilians have their own
extensive categories in the Latin Grammys, but they rarely rise to
the top ranks in nominations. Brazil may be a world unto itself on
the continent, but its exquisite music deserves wider attention.
Still, Lins is a dark horse to win.</TE>
<TE>   Closing out the field is a surprise--veteran Spanish singer Miguel
Bose with his album "Sereno." After some very appealing pop hits in
the '80s, Bose started doing dense and ponderous pop music, and
essentially disappeared from the U.S. market. For that reason, this
album isn't likely to prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Song of the Year</TE>
<TE>   Juanes, the bright young Colombian singer-songwriter who had an
impressive seven nominations last year for his debut album, "Fijate
Bien," didn't release his follow-up, "Un Dia Normal," in time for
this year's awards. But the single "A Dios Le Pido," did qualify,
earning a nomination in this songwriting category alongside Sanz and
the writers of hits for Vives, Cruz and Bose. This uplifting tune may
just carry away voters with its hopefulness and infectious rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Best New Artist</TE>
<TE>   This is the category that helped make Juanes an international
star. It's become the most interesting of the major Latin Grammy
awards, spotlighting worthy new artists.</TE>
<TE>   Gian Marco is here, along with Jorge Moreno, another fine Miami
pop singer-songwriter. Also in the running are Mexico's Sin Bandera
and Puerto Rican rockers Circo. But the most exciting entry is Cabas,
another Colombian singer-songwriter who fuses folklore with rock in
an intoxicating blend.</TE>

<DH>The singer-songwriter is ascendant again, offering
introspective, heartfelt work just when we need it</DH>

<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Dylan's greatest gift to pop culture has long been seen as his
role in teaching rock 'n' roll to think, making the music more than a
limited teen delight. But it's possible that an even greater
contribution was bringing the singer-songwriter tradition into the
pop mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   It's a breakthrough that is paying welcome dividends this fall, a
season packed with winning new albums from an array of valuable
artists, including Beck, Steve Earle, India.Arie, Rhett Miller and
Ron Sexsmith. Not to mention Tom Petty, Peter Gabriel, Jackson
Browne, Ryan Adams, Peter Case, Tracy Chapman and Badly Drawn Boy.</LD>
<LD>   It's a striking addition to the singer-songwriter tradition that
has been a creative center of the pop experience for much of the last
half century.</LD>
<TE>   Because of the popularity of such guitar-carrying solo artists as
Joni Mitchell, James Taylor and Browne in the early '70s, there is a
tendency to equate the term "singer-songwriter" with folk music.</TE>
<TE>   But the tradition is broad enough to stretch from Stevie Wonder,
Curtis Mayfield and Lauryn Hill in R&amp;B to Chuck D., Ice Cube and
Eminem in rap to Lennon-McCartney, Elvis Costello and Eddie Vedder in
rock to Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and Vince Gill in country music.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on singer-songwriters lessened in recent years as
record producers, from Max Martin to the Neptunes, became the kings
in commercial pop, shaping hits for teen and R&amp;B acts.</TE>
<TE>   The result, in most cases, was anonymous music that frequently had
catchy, commanding textures but rarely any deeply rooted personal
edge.</TE>
<TE>   Against the aftermath of Sept. 11, it's tempting to think there
will be renewed interest in the personal commentary and introspection
that can result from singers telling their stories. If so, this
fall's bounty of albums makes plenty of heartfelt music available.</TE>
<TE>   Although few of the songs in this fall's batch of albums are
direct reflections on the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, all four of the singer-songwriters interviewed for this
article say that day affected them as artists.</TE>
<TE>   India.Arie, part of the refreshing neo-soul movement that includes
singer-songwriters Alicia Keys and Hill, says Sept. 11 underscored
her belief that music can be a positive social force.</TE>
<TE>   "I always felt that music had this special power, but it was
mostly a theory--until I started seeing it for myself," says Arie,
26, whose "Acoustic Soul" album last year led to seven Grammy
nominations, including best album. "There's a connection that you can
feel on stage and in talking to people about music--and that's
especially true after Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Ron Sexsmith, 38, whose wistful tunes tend to have uplifting
components, "I did a show with Lucinda Williams on Sept. 12 [2001]
and we didn't know if people were going to show up or be in the mood
to listen to music because it was such a scary time.</TE>
<TE>   "But I played this song, 'Former Glory,' that I had written for
the new album and you could feel people responding to it as if it had
just been written that day, and that felt good."</TE>
<TE>   For anyone under 40, the idea that pop music isn't built around
singers telling their own stories must sound strange. But for
generations, pop was guys (mostly) in New York (or Nashville or Los
Angeles) writing songs such as "How Much Is That Doggie in the
Window?" and Patti Page (or Bing Crosby or Nat King Cole) singing
them.</TE>
<TE>   There were songwriters in the "secondary" fields of country, folk
and blues who sang their own tunes, but the songs were usually
re-recorded by pop singers if the songs were to be accepted in the
pop market.</TE>
<TE>   All those great Hank Williams country ballads, including "Cold,
Cold Heart" and "Your Cheatin' Heart," were pop hits, but only after
Tony Bennett and Joni James recorded them.</TE>
<TE>   Leadbelly's "Goodnight Irene" and Woody Guthrie's "So Long (It's
Been Good to Know Ya)" only reached the Top 10 through remakes by the
Weavers.</TE>
<TE>   There were, of course, many, many great songwriters before Dylan,
and their songs sometimes fell into just the right hands--Cole Porter
and Frank Sinatra is one of many perfect matches. Mostly, though, the
separation of writing and singing worked against the soulfulness and
character of recordings.</TE>
<TE>   By drawing on the singer-songwriter traditions of country, folk
and blues, some of the early rock stars--notably Chuck Berry and
Buddy Holly--helped open a door for Dylan by writing their own songs.</TE>
<TE>   Berry was by far the most significant of these pioneers. Although
some of his biggest hits were novelty tales designed to catch the
teen ear with their wordplay ("Sweet Little Sixteen"), Berry wove
social observation into other songs ("You Never Can Tell" and
"Brown-Eyed Handsome Man") that helped lift the aspirations of rock
'n' roll songwriting.</TE>
<TE>   The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson and the Beatles' Lennon and McCartney
were making strong strides in furthering this tradition, but it was
Dylan's merging of the folk, blues and country traditions with the
explosive energy of rock in the mid-'60s that remains a landmark
moment in pop.</TE>
<TE>   He not only made rock safe for social ideas, but also wrote love
songs with the same intensity and fearlessness as his commentaries.
John Lennon often pointed to Dylan as the reason his own writing took
on deeper and more inspiring edges.</TE>
<TE>   Together, Dylan and the Beatles made it mandatory for any
self-respecting rocker to write his own material.</TE>
<TE>   "Woody Guthrie kind of invented our job, but Dylan upped the ante
for all of us," says Earle, the Nashville-based singer-songwriter.
"He had a pop sensibility and he understood you don't need a classic
voice. He took out the middleman in pop music and let us all speak to
one another directly."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike India.Arie and Sexsmith, Rhett Miller and Earle did write
post-Sept. 11 songs. Miller, however, was reluctant to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The Old 97's leader, whose first solo album, "The Instigator," is
due Sept. 24, lived so close to the World Trade Center that he and
his now-wife, model Erica Iahn, felt pieces of burning metal in their
hair as they raced from their building that morning.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to the apartment a few weeks later to pick up their
belongings, Miller noticed workmen removing rubble from around
abandoned cars in a parking lot below. He realized the cars had been
owned by people killed in the World Trade Center collapse.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote a song about it--a sort of Woody Guthrie Dust Bowl tale,
he says. But Miller, 32, felt uncomfortable about putting such a
direct Sept. 11 reflection on the album. Fearful of exploiting the
tragedy, he even feels hesitant talking about the song and Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But he does acknowledge that the emotions of his experience crept
into at least one of the album's songs, "Your Nervous Heart." It's
about feeling vulnerable and wanting to comfort a loved one.</TE>
<TE>   There are other songs on Miller's album--especially the tender
"Things That Disappear"--that may be seen as post-Sept. 11
reflections, even though they were written earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of us, Earle watched the collapse of the towers on
television.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody in the country was on the same wave length for
about 45 minutes," says Earle, 47. "I think we were all focused on
the victims and we were scared. But eventually there is a moment when
you start worrying about how it affects you.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I thought was, 'Oh no, all the work we've done
against the death penalty is going to go out the window because this
country is really going to be in the mood for revenge.' But that
hasn't happened, thankfully.</TE>
<TE>   "The next thing was that I started thinking about my 20-year-old
son, because he's registered for the draft."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Earle, whose music has had a social consciousness ever since
his acclaimed "Guitar Town" collection in 1986, began thinking about
the country's response to the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are seeing a time when our civil liberties are
definitely in danger," he says now. "We are doing it to ourselves. We
are giving our law enforcement officials and military a blank check
to do whatever they want to do. As soon as I heard the term 'war' on
television that day, I knew it was time to starting writing."</TE>

<LD>India.Arie</LD>
<LD>   The first time most pop fans heard of Arie was when the
26-year-old Atlanta resident picked up seven Grammy nominations in
January, pitting her against the more widely known Alicia Keys in six
categories, including best album and best new artist.</LD>
<LD>   Arie (her real name is India Arie Simpson) was shut out in the
balloting, but the nominations reflected the music industry's respect
for her debut album, "Acoustic Soul," and she felt pressure to live
up to all that.</LD>
<TE>   "I went to Jamaica after the Grammys to get away from all the
pressures of the business," Arie says. "I had gotten caught up in the
glamour of pop music and the competition of it. The stress was so bad
that my stomach was burning and I realized I didn't need any more of
that."</TE>
<TE>   She channeled those thoughts into "Little Things," the opening
song on "Voyage to India," a stylish album that moves well beyond the
promise of "Acoustic Soul." Due Sept. 24 from Motown, the collection
has a strong spiritual edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the power of words, especially when they are set to
music," says Arie, who works with a team of songwriters but does most
of the lyrics herself. "The message I'm trying to get across is a
belief in humanitarian love and acceptance of all people. It's the
message of so many writers--Steve Wonder, Donny Hathaway, James
Taylor, Bill Withers. They inspired me and I'm trying to pass it on."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Sexsmith</TE>
<TE>   If endorsements carried much weight in pop, Sexsmith would have
been a star years ago. The 38-year-old Canadian's self-titled 1995
debut album caught the ear of critics and respected
singer-songwriters, including Elvis Costello and Paul McCartney.</TE>
<TE>   But sales didn't kick in on that album or his three subsequent
ones, including last year's "Blue Boy," which was co-produced by
Earle.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, his richly melodic, folk-edged songs continued to
reflect a sweet, underdog sensibility that made the hopeful themes
all the more heart-tugging. "Cobblestone Runway," due Oct. 8 from
Nettwerk America, is another winning mix.</TE>
<TE>   In the album, Sexsmith again looks at love from both sides now
(the wariness of "These Days," the optimism of "Up the Road"), and
you feel both the anxieties and the joys of each experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I do write a lot about reassuring myself that everything is going
to be all right," Sexsmith says. "I come from a kind of repressed
background. I think it was easier to be a more complete person in
music than in real life because I could say things I felt more easily
in the songs."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about songwriting influences, he says, "I loved John Lennon
and Bob Dylan, but I could never imagine being that cool. So Ray
Davies was special to me. He seemed to be a little clumsy and messed
up somehow. It was easy to relate to that."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Earle</TE>
<TE>   "John Walker's Blues" is the song that will get the most attention
when Earle's raw, compelling "Jerusalem" album arrives Sept. 24. In
the song, Earle tries to present a human side of John Walker Lindh,
the 21-year-old Californian who pleaded guilty to supplying services
to the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Earle says he has problems with anyone taking up arms, but he also
wanted to remind the country about the importance of civil liberties
and fair hearings.</TE>
<TE>   It's a powerful recording, but several other tunes reflect even
better the Nashville writer's ability to explore public and private
issues. The most striking is "Amerika v. 6.0 (The Best We Can Do)," a
look at faded '60s ideals:</TE>
<TE>   I remember when we was both out on the boulevard</TE>
<TE>   Talking revolution and singin' the blues</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays letters to the editor and cheatin' on taxes</TE>
<TE>   Is the best that we can do.</TE>
<TE>   On "Jerusalem," eased by E-Squared/Aretmis Records, Earle, 47,
also writes about people cut off from their dreams (the unemployed
man in "What's a Simple Man to Do?"; the guy in "I Remember You" who
is haunted by an old relationship).</TE>
<TE>   Earle cites the late Townes Van Zandt as his greatest songwriting
influence. "I was impressed by how literate Townes was," he says.
"Townes used to say his biggest influences were Lightnin' Hopkins and
Robert Frost, and you could see both of those influences in his
work."</TE>
<TE>   Rhett Miller</TE>
<TE>   Miller's Old 97's have been lumped into the No Depression movement
blending country and rock, using blueprints handed down from Jimmie
Rodgers and Hank Williams to Gram Parsons.</TE>
<TE>   So it's surprising when Miller, 32, nominates English rock star
David Bowie as the singer-songwriter he most admires. "I'm not sure
how much I succeed in following through on this goal myself, but I've
always appreciated it when artists didn't make everything too obvious
in their work," says the Texas native. "For me, Bowie always did a
great job of conjuring up these provocative images, but not making
them so straightforward that it felt like you didn't have to work at
understanding what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   In his first solo album, "The Instigator," due Sept. 24 from
Elektra, he deals with relationships from unexpected angles,
combining a strong literary touch with an infectious new-wave energy.
Whether he's worrying about the future of a relationship ("Come
Around") or reminiscing about a slightly preposterous one ("Four-Eyed
Girl"), he's an original, affecting pop-rock presence.</TE>
<TE>   "I really love the awkward moments between people," he says. "I'll
often go through stories from all different angles in my head and
then end up back at that moment when the guy is looking into the
girl's eyes and trying to decide whether to say, 'I love you' or just
give up on the whole thing--that moment when you connect or you
don't."</TE>

<HD>Who Wants to Be a Quizmaster? She Does</HD>
<DH>Meredith Vieira, once an elite '60 Minutes' newswoman,
takes a job that suits her family-oriented lifestyle</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In a 1975 episode of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," character Ted
Baxter contemplates the unthinkable: leaving his job as an anchor to
become--gasp--a game show host in New York. He eventually turns down
the extra money to stay with his pals in Minnesota, after boss Lou
Grant tells him that he's a newsman, not a "quizmaster."</LD>
<LD>   In real life, Meredith Vieira, 48, has opted for Door No. 2. Once
a member of that elite corps of journalists who have made the cut as
correspondents for CBS' long-running newsmagazine "60 Minutes,"
Vieira--gasp--will make her debut Monday as the host of the
syndicated version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."</LD>
<LD>   She's had a few stops in between, and already made the jump out of
straight news in 1997 when she became the first among equals (at
least when Barbara Walters isn't around) on the ABC daytime women's
gabfest "The View," a job she continues to hold. Still, it's not a
decision that all of her former hard-charging news colleagues
understand. Vieira is unapologetic. Asked to chart the "intellectual"
journey she has made with her career choices, she says her decisions
have instead been "emotional. I follow my heart."</LD>
<TE>   Vieira's split from "60 Minutes" in 1991 was an early and very
public skirmish in what's become in recent years a more open struggle
among women in the workplace to find the right balance between career
and family. Reporting, with its unpredictable hours tied to the news,
posed a particularly thorny problem.</TE>
<TE>   After working her way up through local radio and television
stations to CBS News correspondent and the CBS newsmagazine "West
57th," Vieira was tapped as just the eighth person to join the
exclusive "60 Minutes" crew in 1989, when Diane Sawyer left for ABC.
Vieira moved into an office heavy with the symbolism of having once
belonged to CBS anchor Walter Cronkite. "All of me connected to TV
news," she says of her early career. "I loved telling stories."</TE>
<TE>   But Vieira started at "60 Minutes" as a part-timer, because she
and her husband, Richard Cohen, a former CBS News producer, had just
had a son after several miscarriages, she says. She had agreed to go
full time after two years, but became pregnant again and asked to
remain half-time. Don Hewitt, the legendary "60 Minutes" founder and
executive producer, said it was full time or nothing. She left.</TE>
<TE>   In her early days at "60 Minutes," Vieira already talked about
feeling the pressure to perform and about a struggle to balance her
life. But the move still came as a blow. She told the Washington Post
that "I've gone through being mad and depressed.... I'm sorry to lose
the job. I wish they could have shown some flexibility, but I
understand."</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt and CBS, meanwhile, were criticized for pushing out a
pregnant woman. Looking back, Hewitt says that if Vieira had
volunteered to take a salary cut at the time, instead of her full
salary, he would have been happy to have her stay. "I think the world
of her....I think she's very talented; she's great-looking, she's
great-sounding, and when she's on television, you know she's there."</TE>
<TE>   But, he says, "I don't think, in retrospect, she should have taken
the job, because physically she wasn't up to it." Of her new gig, he
says, "I wish ABC would have paid her enough money so she didn't have
to become host of a game show ....I certainly understand why she's
taking the job because it's going to put some of her kids through
college and pay off her mortgage and buy her a new car every year and
that's hard to argue with."</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, Vieira calls her departure from CBS "an easy
decision," adding: "My priorities began to change." She had wanted
children for a long time and didn't want to be on the road, as the
job required. She says that "I have in my own heart made my peace
with Don. I delivered for him and he certainly treated me with
respect. I think he thought I was an odd duck."</TE>
<TE>   Vieira went briefly to CBS' early morning news "and hated it. I'm
not an early-morning person." She became pregnant with a third child
and left CBS for good.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding executives at ABC News hired her for a documentary
newsmagazine where she had flexibility; she calls it "an idyllic
job." But when the show ended, she declined a move to take on more
traditional newsmagazine work. Her husband pushed her to try out for
"The View," which was being put together by her ABC News colleague
Barbara Walters. He told her, "You keep saying you want to be a
reporter, but you don't do the job." She thought it might spark some
other ideas, but she didn't expect to get the job and didn't bother
with hair and makeup when she auditioned.</TE>
<TE>   When she got the job, she found she loved the freedom of being
able to express an opinion, something she couldn't do as a
journalist. "It's very possible to love news and also love something
else," she says. "A job has to fit into your life."</TE>
<TE>   To friends who asked, "How could she?," she replies, "To me, it is
apples and oranges. I'm proud of everything that I did." (She quickly
amends that to joke that at some point in her news career she
probably asked a subject "How does it feel?" and "I regret that
now.")</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, 2001, Vieira found validation that she had made the
right decisions in her life. The magnitude of the terror attacks
energized many news reporters. NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, for one, put
off a contemplated retirement from daily anchoring because he wanted
to cover the story. Vieira had the opposite reaction. "All I wanted
was to get my husband and go home" to the children, she said. "There
wasn't one bone in my body that wanted to pick up a camera and a
notepad and head for the towers."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, when CBS News came calling again in the spring,
trying to tempt her to become anchor of "The Early Show," or some
form of morning program, she listened. But not very seriously, it
seems. "I had done it enough. Morning news is the most grueling
schedule and I'm a night owl." Given her competitive nature, she
would have felt the need to take the program to first place from its
current third, she says, and the job would have become "a fourth
child and I can barely juggle three." ABC dangled the "Millionaire"
gig to get her to stay with "The View."</TE>
<TE>   Female game show hosts are themselves a rarity. At a recent
"Millionaire" taping in New York, Vieira, wearing high, spiky heels,
showed herself to be the opposite of Britain's snippy Anne Robinson,
who needled contestants on NBC's "The Weakest Link."</TE>
<TE>   Vieira goes even further than many game show hosts, however, with
their mildly condescending "aren't they so cute" attitude toward
their guests. Showing the same emotional touch she often brought to
her news stories, she hugs contenders, grabbing their hands and
rooting for them to win, clapping when they get a tough answer right.
She trades confidences with a Valley Glen guest about her favorite
Beatle (Paul) and doesn't always stick to the script. She has to
retape an opening segment when she ad-libs something that the
producers don't want. The "Is that your final answer?" shtick that
was host Regis Philbin's trademark on the prime-time version of the
show has been softened to "Final?" or "Final answer?"</TE>
<TE>   "She's the same person on camera as off camera," says Michael
Davies, the executive producer. "On television, that doesn't happen
very often."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview in her office later, Vieira says she finds it hard
to watch contestants walk away losers when she knows that some are
playing for the money to buy something as simple as a new kitchen
floor. "I invest deeply in them emotionally," she says. "They're
nervous. You just want to relax them and I can't do anything." She
writes every contestant a note after their moment in the money chair.</TE>
<TE>   Vieira got the job without a tryout. The skills aren't that
different from what she has done in her professional life, drawing
out the guest's personal story or ad-libbing to fill time when the
guest hesitates on an answer. Unlike on live television, if she
goofs, it can be fixed.</TE>
<TE>   The new version moves faster than the prime-time one, which was an
hour to the syndicated show's half-hour. The "fastest finger" round,
in which a group of contestants vie to play, has been eliminated.
Some of the early questions are more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Vieira calls herself a fan of the show long before she was
approached for the job, because it can be watched by parents and
children together. Eventually, she says, it might even open the door
to another career she envisions, behind the camera as a developer of
family entertainment, whether writing books for children or producing
kids' television shows. "It's great to reinvent yourself," she says.</TE>

<LD>I feel the same way about the current crop of films portraying
mothers as I do about pornos: I wish that just once the story could
be told from the other perspective ("Dear Old Mom? Hardly," by
Michele Willens, Sept. 8).</LD>
<LD>   Although I feel heartened that mothers are no longer portrayed as
ineffective, benign angels and have become full human beings with all
of a mortal's insufferable traits, we're not getting the whole story.
It's only the kids' point of view we're being fed.</LD>
<LD>   I yearn for a movie that tells the story of what can turn a mother
into a harridan. Raising kids in the current American culture is
probably one of the greatest challenges womankind has ever faced.</LD>
<TE>   Unless a parent shouts loudly and passionately, her voice urging
her progeny to explore literature or art or classical music will be
drowned out by the incessant drumbeat of the popular culture that
pounds on her kids day and night, telling them that sex is the
greatest good and that they too can be pop stars if only they drink
the right soft drink. The only alternative a parent has is to isolate
her kids, but just think what criticism that would bring.</TE>
<TE>   I know that I'm only pipe dreaming and that the movie I long for
will never be made. Just as women are not the target demographic for
pornography, we older, battle-scarred moms aren't the ones lining up
at the movie houses on Saturday night. I guess I'll just have to
stick to books and the occasional foreign film.</TE>

<TE>   I'd like to thank Michele Willens for saving me the price of
admission to "Igby Goes Down." I no longer feel the need to see this
movie since Willens revealed the ending in the first sentence of her
story about actresses and their roles as mothers.</TE>

<LD>I found it amusing that Disney was having "special problems" in
adapting the English-language version of "Miyazaki's Spirited Away"
("Entering Strange Realms," by Charles Solomon, Sept. 8).</LD>
<LD>   I have been a voice-over actress and anime adaptation writer for
the last 20 years. There is a small contingent of people who have
been writing and directing anime projects that have come to the West
Coast since they became popular.</LD>
<LD>   These projects include "Robotech" (a turning point in animation
series for television), "Digimon: Digital Monsters" and the recently
released "Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis," as well as many others. Many of
us can write dialogue by "seeing" the sync, rather than cutting,
stretching and condensing dialogue unnaturally using digital means.</LD>
<TE>   There is very little rewriting in the studio with a good "sync"
writer because we are so adept at getting it right the first time.
Perhaps Disney would be smart to take a look at some of us when it
produces its next anime extravaganza.</TE>
<TE>   There are also many actors and actresses who specialize in dubbing
and are capable of giving a natural performance in a medium that
requires this special skill.</TE>

<TE>   Charles Solomon is certainly entitled to opine on anime's lack of
mainstream success in the U.S., but he at least ought to be up to
date. "Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis" has grossed well over $700,000 in
theaters since January, and continues to play strongly on the
repertory and midnight circuits.</TE>
<TE>   And it did so with only 20 prints, not 2,000--"limited release"
means just that.</TE>
<TE>   As I write this, "Metropolis" is the third-highest grossing anime
in U.S. history, although we're fully prepared to slip back to fourth
once "Spirited Away" opens.</TE>

<LD>I agree with Pamela Wells that downtown L.A. is "appalling,
depressing and disgusting" (Letters, Sept. 8). She is absolutely
correct in her assertion of bureaucratic malfeasance and inertia.
However, it is not true that "there is no food to be had between 3
and 7 p.m."</LD>
<LD>   As in Lower Manhattan, there are plenty of places to grab a slice,
a sub, maybe even a French dip sandwich from a place that's been
around since the early 1900s. I have been at 21st and Alameda since
1985, have seen a lot, and all I can say is: If you cannot survive
the temperature, then you do not belong in the kitchen and have no
authority to complain about the heat.</LD>

realize. A Brookings Institution study of major American cities
showed that there were only four where downtowns gained residents in

<TE>   Los Angeles was one, along with three cities generally thought to

<HD>Wanted: Women of a Certain Age</HD>
<DH>Actresses over 40 make up a growing segment of the
population on the tube's many ensemble series</DH>

<LD>Blythe Danner recalls part of a dinner conversation she had with
actress Leslie Caron nearly 30 years ago. "She said, 'I have to go
back to Europe now because I'm over 35.' " Now, says Danner, "it
seems that there are more opportunities for older women, at least in
television." As the star of CBS' "Presidio Med," the 59-year-old
Danner is one of a growing number of exuberant, strong-willed and
complex women over 40 featured in prime-time television.</LD>
<LD>   Back in the days of "The Golden Girls," it was almost a novelty to
find active, vibrant older actresses in leading roles on television.
During the past several seasons, however, that has begun to change.
With an onslaught of ensemble dramas, women over 40 are continually
being pushed into the forefront and defying stereotypes of mature
women devoid of personality, sexuality and corporate savvy.</LD>
<LD>   Take, for instance, Holland Taylor, the libidinous judge Roberta
Kittleson on ABC's "The Practice," or Dyan Cannon, the wily Judge
Jennifer "Whipper" Cone of Fox's departed "Ally McBeal." Both
actresses played older, successful women who were alluring,
provocative and sexy to their younger, powerful male counterparts.</LD>
<TE>   That is certainly the case with 46-year-old Kim Cattrall, who
plays lusty vixen Samantha Jones on HBO's "Sex and the City."
Moreover, who could doubt the professional prowess of Marg
Helgenberger, 43, of CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," or
Allison Janney, 41, of NBC's "The West Wing"? As scientist and
politico, respectively, they are among the tops in their class. Pick
any woman on Lifetime's Sunday-night slate, and the same would be
true. This fall's new series will continue to showcase vital,
interesting women who are north of their 39th birthdays.</TE>
<TE>   Of its five female characters, "Presidio Med" has three mature
leads, including Danner; Dana Delany, 46; and Anna Deavere Smith, 51,
as headstrong, dedicated veteran San Francisco doctors who care for
patients and battle HMOs at work while juggling relationships and
personal crises at home.</TE>
<TE>   Other series with 40-plus women include NBC's "Crossing Jordan"
newcomer Lorraine Toussaint, 42, as a rival for the series' younger
star, Jill Hennessy. CBS' "CSI: Miami" will see the series return of
two veteran television actresses: 40-year-old Kim Delaney ("Philly")
and 45-year-old Khandi Alexander ("NewsRadio" and "The Corner").</TE>
<TE>   "When you think about women like Allison Janney, Laura Innes [of
NBC's "ER"], Hattie Winston [of CBS' "Becker"], women who bring so
much to the table--what would these shows be like with a 22-year-old
in their place?" Alexander asks. "Women have lied about their age for
so long. But honey, how long can you be 38? Now we're kind of able to
be who we are and be wonderful about it."</TE>
<TE>   Mature women face similar challenges in the news business. While
Diane Sawyer, 57, and Barbara Walters, 71, have maintained their
high-profile careers, news and information programs more typically
spotlight younger faces. If, in most cases, that's due to the same
preferences exhibited by series TV casting agents, in others it can
be chalked up to the choices women in the media must make. Consider
Walters' colleague on "The View," Meredith Vieira, who put aside her
high-flying news career when she started her family. The time demands
of young children and a peripatetic career in broadcast journalism
proved to be too much of a conflict. She has managed to maintain her
professional life, although by taking a far different direction. (See
story, Page 96.)</TE>
<TE>   Although the landscape may be blossoming with opportunities,
overall the picture is not as rosy. According to "Boxed In," a study
of female characters during the 2000-01 season, women are
considerably younger than their male counterparts on television. The
report shows that the majority of female characters were in their 20s
and 30s, while most men were in their 30s and 40s. Meanwhile, just 4%
of women characters on TV are at least 60 years old; that age group
accounts for 19% of the actual female population.</TE>
<TE>   "And things don't change much from year to year," says Martha
Lauzen, a professor at the School of Communications at San Diego
State University, who has conducted the annual study for nearly a
decade. "Each and every night of the week there are significantly
more women watching prime-time television than men, and older
individuals tend to watch more television than younger individuals.
You would think that the networks would really want to create
programming that would appeal to that older female viewer over 40,
because those are the people that are watching."</TE>
<TE>   Nor are advertisers quick to change their focus, Lauzen says,
considering that the majority of advertising dollars are aimed at
women 18 to 49. And it's been that way for several decades.</TE>
<TE>   Such choices run counter to current reality, says Hollace Davids,
a publicity executive at Universal Pictures and president of Women in
Film, a Hollywood organization promoting employment of women in the
film and TV businesses. "Your 55-year-old today is not the same as
your 55-year-old 20 years ago," she says. "This is the
fastest-growing demographic with the most money. You're leaving money
on the table by not paying attention to this group."</TE>
<TE>   It can be argued that this current wave in television signifies a
sea change in public attitudes. Jack Bender, a longtime director on
"Ally McBeal," "Boston Public," "Alias" and "Judging Amy," who is now
co-executive producer of Fox's "girls club," says that shows
featuring seasoned female leads reflect the demands of the growing
baby-boomer generation who want to see more empowered images of
themselves in their entertainment media.</TE>
<TE>   "Our culture is youth-obsessed, but the world isn't--and it's time
our media catch up with that," Bender says. "It's a very difficult
thing, not only for actresses, to have that little window in their
teens and 20s to have a career. As a culture we need to embrace the
fact that women reach their prime at a later age, an older age, and
we have to find a way to deal with that and express that on
television."</TE>
<TE>   It certainly helps matters that there is significant pool of
broadcast and cable network executives, show creators, producers and
writers who are a part of that female demographic. Among the
Hollywood Reporter's list of the 100 most powerful women in
entertainment, more than half of the 48 television executives and
creators are 40-plus. Consequently, it would come as no surprise that
the women they champion in series are not unlike themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Your age and your experience certainly color the way in which you
view the world," says Carol Mendelsohn, co-creator and co-executive
producer of "CSI: Miami." "I think, [my producing partner] Ann
Donahue and I both feel that we really stepped into our own when we
were in our 40s. When you get to be 40, you suddenly don't care about
what anybody thinks. And when you look at Marg Helgenberger, at
Khandi Alexander, at Kim Delaney, they bring that. They are women,
and their sexuality isn't just out there....They're leading with
their brains, their experience and the fact they are women and not
afraid to let the world view them as women."</TE>
<TE>   But CBS' president of entertainment, Nancy Tellem, cautions that
scripting great characters is not solely a gender-biased issue. "When
you're really looking at roles, you also have to step outside of
yourself a little bit because your personal views don't necessarily
reflect what the viewing public is going to accept," Tellem says.
"It's less about being a woman in this position and making sure that
women are defined as a reflection of who you are, but [instead
making] creative choices that really reflect who you are as a person,
not necessarily as a woman."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks in large part to television, actresses have an opportunity
to play interesting, three-dimensional characters on screen as the
dearth of equally compelling roles in film continue to diminish with
every explosive, testosterone-packed action film unleashed on a
youth-driven public.</TE>
<TE>   "Feature films? Forget about it, there just aren't any great
parts," says actress-director Christine Lahti, 42. Since leaving CBS'
"Chicago Hope" in 1999, Lahti has starred in nearly a dozen
made-for-television features, including Showtime's upcoming World War
II biopic, "Gisella Perl," because character-driven women's roles
have been scarce on the big screen. "They're the boring, girlfriend
parts. They sit home and wring their hands saying, 'Honey, come
home.' I mean, why isn't Meryl Streep doing two movies a year? De
Niro is."</TE>
<TE>   Women in Film's Davids adds: "Leading ladies in film tend to be
younger women. The whole argument is whether these ladies are still
sexy and beautiful at 40. When Rene Russo was the romantic lead in
'The Thomas Crowne Affair' it was such a big deal because, 'Oh my
God, she's over 40 and look how sexy she is!' When we're talking
about aging male actors like Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Al
Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Sean Connery, there's never a question
about how sexy and wonderful these guys are."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, television has been the bastion of hope for the
careers of mature film actresses like Joan Collins, Jane Wyman, Faye
Dunaway, Sally Field, Glenn Close, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler,
Geena Davis and Whoopi Goldberg. It's important not only as a place
to work in front of the camera, but also for extending their careers
behind-the-scenes as producers and directors.</TE>
<TE>   "Particularly for networks who are perhaps struggling to come up
with signature shows, it helps them to have an established name,"
says David Bushman, curator of the Museum of Television &amp; Radio in
New York City. "A lot of times you have an actress that is looking
for what the network is looking for, specifically with networks like
Lifetime, WE and Oxygen. So you have a meeting of needs that creates
additional opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   The progress of women in front of the camera and behind the scenes
has indeed been significant, says Mollie Gregory, author of "Women
Who Run The Show: How a Brilliant and Creative New Generation of
Women Stormed Hollywood, 1973-2000." Still, "I can't say by 2010
we'll have parity," Gregory says. "I think the forward motion will
simply continue. It's just too slow."</TE>

<DH>TV's unsettling new era is marked by paranoia sweeping
executive suites and police swarming our screens</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Engaging in a form of cultural carbon-dating, pundits assign themes
to each new television season and even whole decades--trying to gain
a handle on what popular entertainment tells us about the public mood
at a certain time.</LD>
<LD>   Such assessments are invariably a bit simplistic, but they promise
to be especially so for this year's fall TV lineup, which based on a
preliminary sampling offers more intrigue behind the scenes than in
any of the trends played out before the cameras.</LD>
<LD>   Just to review, the 1950s earned an enduring designation as the
golden age of drama, although those years also gave birth to the
modern sitcom and a posse of westerns that rode triumphantly through
the next decade. The '70s evoke images of jiggly, escapist fare like
"Charlie's Angels" and "Fantasy Island," plus the social comedy of
"All in the Family" and "Laugh-In." The '80s became associated with
the Reagan era's conspicuous consumption (think "Dynasty" and
"Dallas"), but also marked the transition to the grittier dramatic
style exemplified by "Hill Street Blues" and "St. Elsewhere."</LD>
<TE>   Today--with thoughts of terrorism never too far away, high-flying
Internet companies grounded and millions suffering from stock-market
hangovers--even the Cosmopolitan-sipping protagonists of "Sex and the
City" might reach for a new kind of cocktail.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome, then, to the Maalox Millennium.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, any theme for the current TV climate must recognize the
encroachment of corporate sponsorships--a trend propelled along by
series such as "American Idol," which clumsily integrated Ford and
Coke into the action. Seeking a hedge against remote controls and
devices such as TiVo that facilitate zapping through commercials,
harried executives seem increasingly willing to let advertisers ooze
into the shows themselves.</TE>
<TE>   As for Maalox, what better (legal) product could one choose to
capture the apprehension that has crept into the industry, where
tolerance of failure resembles that exhibited by the villains in
James Bond movies.</TE>
<TE>   Two broadcast networks, after all, jettisoned top programmers
earlier this year, and even top-rated NBC underwent a high-level
shift days after the last TV season concluded in May. Given that,
it's no wonder members of that elite network club approach their jobs
like contestants on the elimination games they broadcast--programs
with appropriate titles like "Survivor," "Fear Factor" and "Dog Eat
Dog."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it lost on TV industry veterans that modern network
entertainment chieftains wield less authority than their predecessors
did a mere decade ago--a function of industry consolidation that has
stacked studios on top of networks, with the extra layers of
management tamping down the power of those ostensibly in charge.</TE>
<TE>   That corporate structure is hardly a prescription for risk-taking,
which helps explain why this season's main thematic element is a
surplus of crime shows. Granted, one can argue that it's partly
attributable to a hunger for good guys and security post-Sept. 11,
but it probably has as much to do with job security, as executives
seek to prolong their careers by churning out "brand extensions" of
what's already successful.</TE>
<TE>   Put those forces together, and it's so long, touchy-feely '90s
dramas; hello, spinoffs and knockoffs of "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" and "Law &amp; Order."</TE>
<TE>   Based on such examples, the programming gestalt in the Maalox
Millennium no longer lends itself to facile appraisals, because each
network--indeed, almost every facet of the TV industry--enters the
season with its own complex, underlying set of headaches and back
story.</TE>
<TE>   From that perspective, no one has more to worry about than ABC,
which saw the bill come due faster than anticipated for riding the
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" gravy train into the ground. Top
officials haven't done themselves a favor, either, by characterizing
the coming year as a make-or-break proposition not just for the
network, but parent Disney, bringing an almost operatic quality to
such mundane questions as whether anyone wants to see a new sitcom
starring John Ritter.</TE>
<TE>   With the vultures circling, ABC has also handed critics and
headline writers a wealth of metaphorical ammunition, ordering
"Dinotopia," a show about dinosaurs (insert extinct network joke
here), and another drama for later in the year titled "Miracles,"
sure to provoke snide comments about what might be necessary to stem
the network's ratings slide.</TE>
<TE>   Although ABC's fate will be examined in minute detail, competitors
have their own reasons to slug a soothing gelatinous liquid right out
of the bottle. Fox, for one, ran second in the futility department
last season--a fact obscured by its blockbuster ratings for the Super
Bowl and World Series; the critical plaudits showered on new programs
"The Bernie Mac Show" and "24"; and all the energy the press
exhausted on bashing ABC.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook for the 2002-03 season suddenly appears somewhat
brighter thanks to the prospect of a second "American Idol," but the
network nevertheless enters the fall minus two long-running signature
shows, "The X-Files" and "Ally McBeal." In addition, questions linger
around one of its highest-profile new series, "Firefly," a sci-fi
concept from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" creator Joss Whedon. An
expensive two-hour prototype was deemed too convoluted to introduce
the program, feeding speculation about the likelihood of a fast
flameout.</TE>
<TE>   One might think NBC enters the season feeling smug and sassy,
having booked a record $2.7 billion in preseason advertising sales.
However, the network must clear a series of hurdles to sustain the
good times--none bigger than its lack of a clear replacement for
"Friends" heading into what has been billed as the show's final year.
Even if the cast relents, concedes that movies are a crapshoot (thank
you, "Serving Sara") and agrees to another year, past misfires in
nurturing new comedies will be reflected in the sky-high sticker
price.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, "The West Wing" becomes a free agent after this season,
meaning NBC faces a tough negotiation to renew the show beyond 2003.
With hungry competitors scratching at the door, at a minimum the
Warner Bros.-produced series is sure to command a massive raise in
the fee NBC pays for it.</TE>
<TE>   It's also worth noting that beyond "Friends," "Must-See TV" looks
a bit musty. "Frasier" opens its 10th season surrounded by sitcoms of
dubious appeal, "Will &amp; Grace" has proved vulnerable to CBS' "CSI"
battering ram, and there's reason to wonder if the departure of
Anthony Edwards, as the soulful Dr. Greene, is one "ER" cast
defection too many.</TE>
<TE>   CBS, meanwhile, has clearly bolstered its status--although some of
its strides Thursday with "CSI" and "Survivor" have been offset by a
weakened roster on Sundays, once its most formidable night.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the network has no shortage of Maalox moments
ahead--beginning with morning program "The Early Show." Bryant Gumbel
left in May, and after rotating hosts throughout the summer, CBS
stations expect the latest overhaul of the long-suffering franchise
to provide less feeble resistance to NBC's "Today" and ABC's "Good
Morning America."</TE>
<TE>   CBS could also spend more than its share of time dealing with
public-relations snafus, mostly of its own making. Thus far, the
network has stated plans to broadcast a miniseries about Hitler's
early years (a project that generated criticism during the script
stage) and picked up rights to a Victoria's Secret lingerie
fashion-show special. When ABC televised last year's show, it drew
solid ratings but also prompted a complaint to the Federal
Communications Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Masters golf tournament has pitched CBS into a PR sand
trap, with a women's organization pressuring the network to drop
coverage because the organizing club has never admitted a female
member.</TE>
<TE>   Just focusing on the major networks, however, only scratches the
surface of the unsettling elements in TV's alphabet soup, from
MTV--with "The Osbournes" under a cloud because of Sharon Osbourne's
cancer--to MSNBC, which after a much-ballyhooed overhaul with
"Donahue" as a centerpiece has watched ratings drop faster than the
Dow Jones industrial average.</TE>
<TE>   Other general issues contribute to TV's collective malaise.
Entertainment stocks have taken a drubbing, to the point that
muttering the word "options" around AOL Time Warner executives can
trigger uncontrollable weeping.</TE>
<TE>   The advertising market rebounded from its tech-driven swoon in
2001, but no one is sure how long that will last. As it is, sources
say networks and production companies have used the downturn as an
excuse to try reducing the fees paid to writers, who have already
seen the number of lucrative contracts studios once bandied about to
secure their services dwindle and disappear.</TE>
<TE>   The pain has trickled down to the industry's rank and file as
well, with the emphasis on cost-cutting fueling the migration of
production to Canada and other international locales where filming is
less expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Television station employees have equal reason to fret about their
fate because of the advent of "duopolies"--a setup in which one
company owns two stations in the same city, spurring layoffs of
overlapping staff.</TE>
<TE>   These are just a few of the plots and subplots provided by the
fiscal TV year that begins Sept. 23, to be played out in the months
ahead. Until then, all that network executives, studio tycoons,
producers and crews can do is try to be optimistic as they await the
season's first official plop-plop, fizz-fizz cancellation--brought to
you, no doubt, by Alka-Seltzer.</TE>

<DH>Well collected but not always well liked, artist
Jean-Baptiste Greuze missed his true calling by 200 years</DH>

<LD>Tom Cruise as Jean-Baptiste Greuze?</LD>
<LD>   Well, the names do rhyme, offering some pronunciation help, but
there's more to the casting possibility than just a trick of the
tongue.</LD>
<LD>   The 18th century French artist was arrogant, ambitious, scandalous
and brilliant. He led a juicy life--a life, as they say, made for the
movies. Which is why, in a conversation about Greuze, curator Edgar
Munhall tosses out a big star's name, with a scheming little laugh.</LD>
<TE>   Munhall retired in 1999 as chief curator at the Frick Collection
in New York; he's now Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence at the
reference library there. For several decades, he has carried the
scholarly torch for Greuze. In 1976, he organized the only
comprehensive exhibition of the painter's work since his death. Now
he's assembled "Greuze the Draftsman," the first show to focus on the
artist's drawings. It opened last week at the J.Paul Getty Museum,
with two other Getty-organized exhibitions, one featuring 12 of the
artist's paintings (five of them from Southern California
collections), and the other presenting drawings by Greuze's
contemporaries in France.</TE>
<TE>   Greuze scholarship has been a lonely field, laments Munhall, a
dapper man of 69 with a pencil-thin mustache and a short bristle of
salt-and-pepper hair. Shortly after the drawings show opened at the
Frick in May, he sat for an interview in the Upper East Side
mansion-museum, in a stately meeting room that was once Henry Clay
Frick's bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Art historians with a particular interest in Greuze are few,
Munhall admits, and general interest in the artist's work has also
been limited.</TE>
<TE>   "It's either too sentimental," he says with a sigh, "or we're too
cynical. One or the other."</TE>
<TE>   Reacting against the artificiality and sensual excess of the
Rococo style, Greuze turned for his subject matter to ordinary people
in their everyday lives: a family reading the Bible together around
the dinner table, future in-laws arranging a marriage contract. His
paintings read like domestic morality tales, populated by devoted
children, loving mothers and respected elders. But also their
opposite--defiant youths and punishing parents. To a contemporary
eye, the work can seem melodramatic and dated, but less so if you
consider it in the terms Munhall proposes.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, his is a narrative art, and the closest parallels are
not so much in plays or operas, but in the medium of film," he says.
"I think he conceived those dramatic scenes in terms of light and
shade and exploration of character just as a filmmaker would."</TE>
<TE>   Not only, then, does Greuze's life lend itself to being told on
film (Cruise's availability notwithstanding), but his paintings
function like movies, reflecting familiar situations in a staged but
accessible format. If Greuze had been born 200 years later, Munhall
speculates, he'd have been a great filmmaker. (To reinforce this
connection, the Getty has scheduled a film program called "The
Magnificent Melodrama" to overlap with the Greuze shows.)</TE>
<TE>   When Munhall mentioned Greuze's filmic approach to a dealer less
kindly disposed toward the artist's works, the dealer sneered,
comparing them instead to television sitcoms.</TE>
<TE>   There's a certain truth to that as well, Munhall agrees. Starting
in 1755, Greuze exhibited regularly at the biennial Salon exhibitions
held at the Louvre. The Parisian public attended the shows in large
numbers and grew familiar with Greuze's characters, expecting, show
after show, to track their lives in his work, as TV viewers might
follow the exploits of the Cosby family or the Osbournes. Viewers
would assume, for instance, that the young bride in one canvas was
the same person as the daughter caring for her aged father in
another. "People just ate that up," Munhall says, "and Greuze
exploited it for all it was worth."</TE>
<TE>   Greuze was one of only a few artists of his time to exhibit
drawings as well as paintings at the Salon. In his drawings, wrote
the philosopher and critic Denis Diderot, "Greuze truly shows himself
to be a man of genius."</TE>
<TE>   His skill at rendering human form in all of its postures and
permutations was extraordinary--and he knew it. When one of his
professors noted what seemed like a physical deformity in a drawing
of a male nude, Greuze snapped, "Monsieur, you would be happy if you
could do one as good."</TE>
<TE>   The Getty's supplementary show of French drawings includes work by
Watteau, Fragonard and others, in ink, wash, pastel and colored
chalk. Greuze was equally adept at all of them.</TE>
<TE>   Greuze, says Getty drawings curator Lee Hendrix, "mastered
everything. As Diderot said, 'This man draws like an angel.' And one
of the things that distinguishes him, besides the incredible range,
is the new way that he portrayed the lives of everyday people. He
would go out into the streets of Paris to look for faces that spoke
to him. And he reached into his own personal life in a way that was
unprecedented, with a will to get to the truth as he saw it."</TE>
<TE>   Among the 70 drawings in "Greuze the Draftsman" is a group of
expressive heads--tetes d'expression. Immediate and honest, they
capture a range of intense emotions, from maternal distress to sexual
rapture. The drawings were often made as preparatory studies for
larger compositions, but they stand on their own, aesthetically. In
Greuze's day, they were collected as independent works of art.</TE>
<TE>   "We're beginning to get a clearer view of how people didn't always
keep drawings in portfolios or boxes, but were really hanging them in
their houses, and usually in great profusion," Munhall says. "They
were in elaborate frames, under glass. People were paying big prices
for them." The market for them recently has also been lively, he
adds. At a July auction, a Greuze chalk and wash drawing estimated at
$30,000 to $45,000, sold for $59,000. Modern audiences seem better
able to connect with the raw urgency of the drawings than with the
more highly finished paintings.</TE>
<TE>   The intimacy of the drawings owes something to their
autobiographical nature. One of Greuze's most repeated subjects, for
instance, was his wife, Anne-Gabrielle Babuti, whom he married in
1759. At first, his drawings of her--especially the rapturous "Head
of a Woman" from the early years of their marriage--reflect his
unbridled love, in frankly erotic terms. Family scenes from those
years, too, represent domesticity as happy and fulfilling. When
Madame Greuze's infidelities caused their relationship to sour, that
too was chronicled in Greuze's art, in scenes of increasing violence
and pessimism. "The Angry Wife" (circa 1785) shows a woman possessed,
lunging into a chaotic dining room to strike her husband, a
sympathetic man flanked by two protective daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Greuze made the drawing after he and his wife had separated, in
part because of incidents like this in their home. In a deposition
aimed at legalizing their separation, Greuze described being slapped
and threatened by his wife, then returning, trembling, to his studio.
"I take some chalk," he wrote, "and make a sketch of that scene of
horror. It is one of the most beautiful drawings I have done. I
invite you to come see it."</TE>
<TE>   Greuze's ambition, Munhall says, overrode all other factors.</TE>
<TE>   "There was just no shame. He wanted to share everything, to as big
a public as he could."</TE>
<TE>   Early success fed that ambition, which grew, eventually, to become
an encumbrance. When Greuze, who was born and trained near Lyon, made
his debut at the Salon in 1755, he was hailed as a "new athlete," and
elected to the Royal Academy as an associate member. When elected,
Munhall explains, "it was expected that you would then give the
academy an example of your work, as a sign of your gratitude for the
honor and, just for the record, that they would have something by you
in their collection."</TE>
<TE>   Greuze didn't present his "reception painting" until an
unconscionable 14 years after his election, and what he finally
presented wasn't what the academy had in mind. "Septimius Severus and
Caracalla" was a history painting, and Greuze was a genre painter.
Breaking rank like that, trying to boost himself up the hierarchical
ladder, was an outrageous act by the standards of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Genre painting, the representation of everyday life, was
considered lowly," Munhall explains, "and history painting, which
treated historical and mythological subjects, was considered the
highest, because [the academy] thought it demanded greater talents.
It was also supposed that a history painter was more of an
intellectual. Also, history painters held positions of greater
authority and were better paid than genre painters. They were the
professors and directors of the Royal Academy, whereas the genre
painter could never aspire to those positions of distinction and
power and wealth. Well, all of this appealed to Greuze, who was
highly ambitious and very proud of what he thought his talents were,
so he decided to go whole-hog for the big job at the top. No one had
ever done it before."</TE>
<TE>   Munhall describes Greuze's "Caracalla" painting as "extremely
modern and original, far beyond what his contemporaries were doing."
But the directors of the academy chafed at Greuze's impertinence.
They voted to receive him as a full member but still classified him
as a genre painter. "He had already antagonized most of the members
of the academy because he was so arrogant and outspoken, and they
were only too happy to put him back in his place," Munhall says.</TE>
<TE>   Greuze gave up on his effort to be a history painter and resumed
his chronicles of everyday life, perhaps, suggests Munhall, with a
bit more sobriety. He conducted a personal boycott of the Salon,
choosing not to show there for the next 30 years, but he used his
studio in the Louvre to stage independent shows that coincided with
the academy's official exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knew about it," Munhall says. "The critics all came to
his studio and treated it as kind of an appendage of the official
Salon. It wasn't until Courbet had his own pavilion of realism in
1855 that another living artist would stage his own exhibitions in an
independent way."</TE>
<TE>   Greuze's renegade behavior and feisty personality certainly didn't
endear him to those he knew. "Not very lovable," one biographer
called him. A "bizarre man," remarked a relative of one of his
patrons.</TE>
<TE>   Yet his work secured Greuze status as one of the leading artists
of his day, well known and extremely well collected. A major
supporter of his art was the court of Catherine II, whose collections
formed the foundation of the State Hermitage Museum in St.
Petersburg. The Hermitage holds the finest collection of Greuze
drawings in the world, many of them loaned to the "Greuze the
Draftsman" show.</TE>
<TE>   When, in 1767, Greuze was invited to Russia by Catherine the
Great, both his virtues and vices were noted in a letter opposing the
trip by Diderot: "He's an excellent artist, but a very disagreeable
character. One should have his drawings and his paintings, and leave
the man at that."</TE>

<HD>Collaborators in Conflict</HD>
<DH>PBS cameras caught the creativity and the clashes that
resulted when Pilobolus dancers and children's author Maurice Sendak
joined forces on a performance piece</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If great art has to "draw blood," as Maurice Sendak maintains, the
first cuts are made in the skin and psyche of the creator.</LD>
<LD>   Or creators, as in the case of Sendak, Pilobolus Dance Theater and
a work called "A Selection."</LD>
<LD>   In 1998, members of Pilobolus invited the children's book
illustrator-author and writer-director Arthur Yorinks, his partner in
a children's theater company called Night Kitchen, to be their first
outside collaborators. Then they invited PBS filmmaker Mirra Banks to
document the process.</LD>
<TE>   The idea was to create a work that could share a program with Hans
Krasa's 40-minute children's opera, "Brundibar," which was performed
at the Nazi show camp Terezin in the 1930s and which Night Kitchen
will produce in 2003. In the end, the collaboration resulted in a
stand-alone work, and a film that shows just how contentious
creativity can be. Banks' "Last Dance" will have its West Coast
premiere next Sunday at the Skirball Cultural Center, as part of the
exhibition "Where the Wild Things Are: Maurice Sendak in His Own
Words and Pictures."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back at the project, Sendak says he was initially thrilled
at the prospect of working with the 30-year-old collective. "I had
long wanted to work with dancers again," he said. In 1983, Sendak had
done "Nutcracker" with Pacific Northwest Ballet--"one of the best
experiences I had had."</TE>
<TE>   At a point about midway through the process, however, one of
Pilobolus' three directors, Jonathan Wolken, will call Sendak's input
"not useful at all," and the 73-year-old artist will reply, with the
camera rolling, "I feel like I was hit with a Scud missile."</TE>
<TE>   "When you start a collaboration like this, you never know what's
going to happen," Banks says now. "In every aspect of making this
work, there were differences of opinion."</TE>
<TE>   As the film begins, Sendak and Yorinks arrive at Pilobolus'
Connecticut studios with a vision. Sendak wants to tell a story about
the Holocaust, and he envisions a train station, people left waiting,
and a villain who will seduce them and lead some of them to their
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   He's eloquent, but Wolken and the other Pilobolus directors--Robby
Barnett and Michael Tracy--and the six Pilobolus dancers are visibly
uncomfortable. They were looking for sets and costumes from Sendak,
and the rest is a little vague. They try to explain their process:
generating dances through improvisational, abstract movement
sessions, not a storyboard and a plot.</TE>
<TE>   The 83-minute film follows the dancing and negotiations over eight
months, from November 1998 to June 1999. Shortly after filming ended,
"A Selection" was performed in New York City; the New York Times'
Anna Kisselgoff called it riveting. Little did she know.</TE>
<TE>   On film, the dancers improvise, with and without the company
directors, with and without Sendak--experimenting with the basic idea
he has handed them. When Sendak is there, he's there: interpreting
and reacting to the movement, spinning out more narrative
explanations, showing his costume sketches (evocations of Anne Frank
and other historical figures), drawing grotesque faces directly onto
the front and back of dancer Otis Cook's white unitard. Banks
occasionally cuts away to weave in historical footage or individual
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Ideas and movement images slowly coalesce even as the
collaborators continue to argue about the plot, the title of the
work, the nudity that Sendak insists must be there to stand for what
happened to concentration camp victims just before they were killed.
For the most part, he prevails.</TE>
<TE>   At times things get testy. "This is not useful to us," says
Wolken, who becomes Sendak's prime antagonist. "This is useful to no
one."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bumped off the rails," Sendak says during another tense
moment.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmaker took it all in uneasily. "I really try to be in a
sense a blank slate in situations like this," Banks says now. "I try
to be responsive to what's actually happening. This was a long and
complicated process. I had to have certain hopes. I didn't want this
project to fall apart."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Wolken says by phone from Connecticut, both he and
Sendak feed off conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "We were open to virtually anything," he says, thinking back over
the way Pilobolus began the process.</TE>
<TE>   "Maurice came in with more of a definite idea, clearly he
solidified something faster, differently. But it wasn't a problem.
That's the given when you work with different collaborators. That
does not mean that one simply accepts."</TE>
<TE>   Sendak is philosophical as well. "There was more conflict than I
anticipated," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "But there always is in a project that includes a number of people
from various disciplines walking a tightrope. This has more
contention than I like or than I anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Sendak's initial idea--five people stranded at a
train station in a burning city and menaced by a sixth enigmatic
figure--actually flowers through the improvisatory sessions as dancer
Cook (formerly of Jacques Heim's Los Angeles-based Diavolo Dance
Theatre) reveals an extraordinary flexibility and creativity in
shape-making. He becomes the menacing figure who toys with the
others, eventually stripping two of them, separating them from the
rest and sending them to their deaths.</TE>
<TE>   All sides say they like the film, and that they'd do another
project together anytime. "For me, what the story was about was
working with Maurice and Arthur," Pilobolus director Barnett says
now. "Learning from them. We were dragged in different directions
than we would normally go. It was one of the most stimulating
projects I worked on."</TE>
<TE>   Wolken stresses that the documentary reflects only a portion of
the whole process.</TE>
<TE>   "Mirra chose times when Maurice, Arthur and the rest of us were
all there," he said. "She did not spend time in the studio when we
were alone or with one or two others.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not meant as a criticism, but Mirra's job as a filmmaker
was to make drama, to make something out of a long process that's
like watching water boil. She got to the boiling point. It's
wonderful to make such a highly concentrated thing out of a process
that was not highly contrasted.</TE>
<TE>   "The film has its own integrity and is more than successful on
that basis alone. It has shape and depth and it plays."</TE>
<TE>   Still, says Wolken, no film can completely capture creativity.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not, cannot be an accurate representation of the process of
creating the dance," he says. "It would not be artistically possible.
You'd have to be there all the time. And even then, you'd have to be
editorial."</TE>

<HD>After Personal Setbacks, a Changed David Gray Returns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lot happened in David Gray's life in the three years since his last
album, "White Ladder."</LD>
<LD>   The British singer-songwriter's father died last year. He and his
wife had their first baby (a girl) just seven weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   And, oh yeah, "White Ladder"--which he made without a record
contract following the tepid commercial reception for his first three
albums--became a worldwide hit, selling 1.8 million copies in the
U.S. alone, according to Nielsen SoundScan figures, after being
released here by the Dave Matthews-owned ATO Records. It was a
gratifying but disorienting surge that had him playing before
ever-growing audiences for the better part of two years.</LD>
<TE>   So, Gray says, anyone who wants to read 9/11 meaning into the
sometimes wrenching, sometimes triumphant songs on his new album, "A
New Day at Midnight" (due Nov. 5) is welcome to do so--but they'll be
off-base.</TE>
<TE>   "The general mood just happened to chime with my own," he says.
"Losing my father and several other minor traumas that happened
around the same time dominated the personal side of the record. And
there's a certain amount of reaction in some of the songs to the
disorientation I was feeling hurtling around the globe while all this
was happening back home."</TE>
<TE>   Even the song "Freedom," written last September, has nothing to do
with geopolitics.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Freedom' was just what I felt when I stopped touring at the end
of August last year," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The album's title, reflecting the jarring changes he went through,
"came to me in a sleepless night."</TE>
<TE>   Sleepless nights are the norm these days with the new baby in the
house, but also with the new-to-him circumstance of making and
launching an album for which many hold high expectations, both
commercial and artistic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm comfortable in the role of the underdog, and I guess that's
one of the reasons I'm concerned now," he says. "I don't take any of
this for granted.... I think people at the record company are
expecting to [sell] a lot of this album. They're not saying, 'Oh no,
Dave let us down.' At least they haven't said it to me."</TE>
<TE>   Gray, though, is trying to balance the demands of the business
with his parental role, and that may be his biggest challenge in the
coming months, considering he may not be willing to spend as much
time on the road as he did following "White Ladder."</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I'll make lots of records, but I've waited a long time
to have a baby, so I've got mixed emotions of being on tour," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be doing tours of places I've never been--Singapore,
Australia, New Zealand. And there will be an American tour, with
Madison Square Garden in January or February. And there's a big
British tour that's just about sold out. But beyond that, it's a
whole different thing this time."</TE>
<TE>   TWO "DAY'S" NIGHTS: As with the upcoming DVD edition of the
Beatles movie "A Hard Day's Night," L.A. events celebrating that
release are filling up with their own bonus features.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 29 at the Egyptian Theatre, the American Cinematheque
will screen a restored 35-millimeter print of the 1964 movie,
preceded by the world premiere of "Things They Said Today ...," a
half-hour special about the movie made by DVD producer and Beatles
historian Martin Lewis. The screening will also be attended by two
actors from "A Hard Day's Night": Victor Spinetti (who played the
neurotic TV director) and John Junkin (he appeared as one of the
band's road managers). Both will take part in a Q&amp;A after the
showing.</TE>
<TE>   Then on Oct. 1, the House of Blues in West Hollywood will host "A
Hard DVD's Night," a party (open to the public) featuring Beatles
tribute band the Fab Four playing all 12 songs from the movie in
order, as well as the incidental and source music. For "Ringo's
Theme," George Martin's instrumental version of "This Boy," the band
will be joined by English guitarist Vic Flick, who played the melody
originally--and who has never performed it since. (He also created
the original James Bond theme guitar sound.)</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Spinetti and Junkin are planning to reenact scenes
from the movie. Junkin will re-create Peter Sellers' version of the
movie's title song, delivered a la a Shakespearean soliloquy as read
by Laurence Olivier--an idea originally conceived for Sellers by
Junkin.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket information and other details can be found on the
Beatles-related Web site www.whatgoeson.com.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Nick Cave has joined Tom Waits and Merle Haggard on
the roster of Anti Records, the roots-and-beyond branch of L.A. punk
haven Epitaph. A new Cave album is expected in early 2003.... Amoeba
Records has bought the entire inventory from soon-to-close Cleveland
music store Shattered Records, which specialized in obscure punk and
metal treasures ranging from limited-pressing singles by such early
punk bands as the Germs to African Metallica releases and Japanese
Guns 'N Roses promotional items. The new collection will be available
for exploration over the Columbus Day weekend, starting Oct. 12, at
Amoeba's Hollywood outlet. Prices will range as high as $500,
although the bulk of the collection is expected to be between $10 and
$20.... A live album from Willie Nelson's guest-laden "Stars &amp;
Guitars" May TV special will be released by Lost Highway Records on
Nov. 5. Among Nelson's musical partners on the release are Sheryl
Crow, Matchbox Twenty, Dave Matthews, Norah Jones and Ryan Adams....
A breast cancer awareness benefit for the Hollywood Sunset Free
Clinic will feature the debut of the Blare Bitch Project, the new
band fronted by Blare N. Bitch, formerly of Betty Blowtorch, whose
leader, Bianca Halstead, was killed in a December car crash. Former
Runaways singer Cherie Currie will emcee the evening, to be headlined
by Texas Terri. It's happening Thursday at the Derby.... Mike City,
who produced Brandy's song "Full Moon" and hits for Sunshine Anderson
and Carl Thomas, is working on new material by Blu Cantrell and 702.
Cantrell's new album is due in early 2003 from Arista Records, while
702's is set for November from Motown.</TE>

<HD>In 'Mundo,' Ruben Blades Mixes Up a Career Capstone</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>****</LD>
<LD>   RUBEN BLADES</LD>
<LD>   "Mundo"</LD>
<TE>   Columbia</TE>
<TE>   Every decade or so, this ever-inventive artist makes a milestone
album. In the '70s, it was "Siembra," his collaboration with Willie
Colon that stands as salsa's "Sgt. Pepper's." In the '80s, it was his
gripping first solo album, "Buscando America," his break from the
confines of Afro-Cuban dance music.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, we've been waiting for an album like "Mundo" (World),
the masterpiece Blades seemed meant to make his whole career (it's
due in stores Tuesday). This is a sweeping, occasionally breathtaking
work that ties together the diverse musical strains he's explored for
decades while moving far beyond anything he's done before.</TE>
<TE>   All the elements that have made Blades so consistently appealing
and inspiring are here: the imaginative storytelling, the rousing
social vision, the true-grit rhythms and memorable melodies. As a
whole, this album also soars with intellectual energy and the sheer
exultation of making music that sounds sublime.</TE>
<TE>   "Mundo" is like a ride on a hot-air balloon, sweeping across
musical landscapes we once considered disparate and foreign. Unlike
the world fusions that simply sample music from hither and yon,
Blades reveals how cultures are connected. Sometimes, the effect is
startling. A salsa piano riff suddenly emerges from a distinctly
Middle Eastern rhythm. Bagpipes work in unison with bata drums.</TE>
<TE>   Blades demonstrates that all music comes from a common source,
like the humans who make it. One moment he's a salsa singer from El
Barrio; the next he's a gravel-voiced Gypsy from nowhere. "In the
Incas' quena flute I hear Ireland/Listen to Iran in bagpipes from
Scotland," he says in the English translation of the opening
"Estampa." The agile playing and intricate arrangements are credited
to an ensemble that includes outstanding Central American musicians,
including pianist Walter Flores and members of Editus, the band that
has recently backed Blades.</TE>
<TE>   The former New Yorker dedicates "Danny Boy," with a celestial
guest vocal by Luba Mason, to the victims of Sept. 11. He follows it
with his hopeful "La Ruta" (The Road), which fades out with the
repeated epitaph taken from a poor grave by the side of the road:
"Continue the route in my name." Always, Blades shows us the way with
conviction and optimism.</TE>
<TE>   Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   DISTURBED</TE>
<TE>   "Believe"</TE>
<TE>   Reprise</TE>
<TE>   The suffering is over. Now Disturbed wants to sing, to dance, even
if the subject remains dark and brooding, all bad memories and
neighborhood threats.</TE>
<TE>   Not that "Believe" (due Tuesday) will surprise any of the 2
million buyers of 2000's "The Sickness." Songs remain thundering
storm clouds of angst, but with a new emphasis on radio-ready
melodies far closer to Creed than Sabbath--nu metal for a nu day.</TE>
<TE>   Little here is as sharp as the band's intense, career-making
single, "Stupefy." There are some nice, grinding riffs from guitarist
Dan Donegan and a strangely lilting ballad that closes the album. But
the music is tuneful in a conventional way, far from the
genre-expanding work of such contemporaries as System of a Down. Same
volume, less detail.</TE>
<TE>   The song "Breathe" begins as an attack of aimless jazzbo metal but
soon kicks into sharp melodic focus, never straying from a tough,
martial beat. And shouter David Draiman is forever the angry mystic,
venting on the big issues and shedding manly tears. Amid the heavy
beats and swirling guitars of "Bound," he warns some misguided rock
chick, "Think you're a little bit closer to changing me?/You're never
winning me over/you're wasting time, yeah!" He still sounds happiest
when sharing bad vibes. Steve Appleford</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   THE CHIEFTAINS</TE>
<TE>   "Down the Old Plank Road</TE>
<TE>   --The Nashville Sessions"</TE>
<TE>   RCA Victor</TE>
<TE>   The historical link between Appalachian and Celtic folk music is
well documented. Who better to anchor a modern celebration of that
kinship than Ireland's chief ambassadors of traditional music?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Chieftains hooked up in Nashville with a bunch of
American country and bluegrass musicians a decade ago for their album
"Another Country." Ricky Skaggs and Bela Fleck are the holdovers from
that outing, joining bluegrass greats Earl Scruggs, Del McCoury and
Alison Krauss, and such alt-country heroes as Lyle Lovett and Gillian
Welch &amp; David Rawlings on this sequel (in stores Tuesday).</TE>
<TE>   The full-throttle emotionalism of Vince Gill's vocal on "Dark as a
Dungeon" and Martina McBride's bittersweet take on the country waltz
"I'll Be All Smiles Tonight" would be as much at home in a Dublin pub
as at the Grand Ole Opry. All the transatlantic jamming develops
organically, without a trace of square pegs being shoehorned into
round holes.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Lifehouse, "Stanley Climbfall," DreamWorks. Mainstream rock
isn't about big surprises. But Lifehouse is notably grittier than
Matchbox Twenty, more organic than Creed. Singer-guitarist Jason Wade
makes rock that is inventive in a modest way, igniting the occasional
explosion of electric guitar, sounding barely contained by the
emotional pop hooks at his fingertips. Showing influences from the
Beatles to Radiohead, the trio's second album (due Tuesday) matches a
flair for anthem-like pop with a spiritual quest only suggested by
last year's radio hit "Hanging by a Moment." On "Anchor," Wade asks,
"Somebody tell me, how did I get here?" Maybe by surprising himself.</TE>
<TE>   S.A.</TE>
<TE>   ** OK Go, "OK Go," Capitol. This Chicago quintet has learned its
lessons well from its old ELO and Cars albums. It lashes beguiling
pop melodies onto elaborate arrangements, with towering guitars,
gurgling organs and big-hearted harmonies that burst forth with Imax
impact. Any band that can weave an axiom such as "mediocre people do
exceptional things all the time" into a pop song has got one up on
any self-help guru.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Weingarten</TE>
<TE>   *** Duncan Sheik, "Daylight," Atlantic. Sheik is a sensitive soul,
an affliction that can lead to darkness (2001's "Phantom Moon") or
light (this album). The New York singer remains a tortured pop
romantic, but he's softened some of the musical edges here, setting
words of regret against acoustic guitars or the mild psychedelia of
"Magazines." Teary-eyed and strong-willed, Sheik is best with
self-recrimination. On "Genius," he purrs, "Somehow I've cornered the
market on the double-standard," interrupting himself with enough
shouting and anxious electric guitar to somehow fit anyone's personal
emo playlist.</TE>
<TE>   S.A.</TE>

<LD>****</LD>
<LD>   DAVE HOLLAND BIG BAND</LD>
<LD>   "What Goes Around"</LD>
<TE>   ECM</TE>
<TE>   When Holland, one of the most versatile bassists in jazz, unveiled
his new quintet in the late 1990s, listeners were struck by the tonal
beauty and expressive fervor of this band. Since then, the Dave
Holland Quintet has been acknowledged as one of the most polished and
creative in acoustic jazz, its acclaim perhaps leading Holland to up
the ante, for his quintet now serves as the core of a new large
ensemble. The big band's first recording proves even more stunning
than the quintet's debut, if only because Holland's ideas on texture,
rhythm and color now are expressed on an immense canvas. Even so,
Holland's adept arrangements convey the transparency of texture,
delicacy of color and malleability of rhythm that made the quintet an
instant hit. Somehow, Holland has created a large band that conveys
multiple riffs without sacrificing transparency of texture, as on the
opening cut, "Triple Dance." The cunning ways Holland paces the
climaxes in "Razor's Edge," pitting reeds against brass, attests to
the high craft of his writing. The title track stands as a tour de
force of big-band writing, with Holland ingeniously developing themes
in an ambitious, 17-minute work that unfolds with as much grandeur
and grace. (The Dave Holland Big Band performs Oct. 3 at UCLA's Royce
Hall.)</TE>
<TE>   ****</TE>
<TE>   CHUCHO VALDES</TE>
<TE>   "Fantasia Cubana"</TE>
<TE>   Blue Note</TE>
<TE>   Although Valdes' virtuosity as a pianist is well known, his
achievements as composer and improviser never have been better
documented than on this splendid solo recording. Offering deeply
personal, often rhapsodic versions of several classical masterworks,
the great Cuban pianist doesn't simply embellish familiar themes--he
reconceives them. Thus Frederic Chopin's Prelude in E Minor (the
piece Jack Nicholson's character famously played in the film "Five
Easy Pieces") attains Lisztian brilliance, even as Valdes preserves
its singing, poetic melody line. By extending the pianistic range and
expressive sweep of Ernesto Lecuona's "La Comparsa," Valdes brings
the masterful Cuban composer firmly into the 21st century. The
unexpected harmonies Valdes develops in Ravel's "Pavane for a Dead
Princess" enriches an already profound work. As composer too, Valdes
acquits himself well, the eloquent writing and heroic scope of his
"Fantasia Cubana" pointing to the range of his gifts. Finally, Blue
Note shrewdly engaged as producer Max Wilcox, whose experience
recording Arthur Rubinstein, among other classical pianists, shows in
the sonic depth and clarity of this disc.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   ARMIK</TE>
<TE>   "Lost in Paradise"</TE>
<TE>   Bolero Records</TE>
<TE>   Only a live performance can verify a musician's technique and
tone, but if the Los Angeles guitarist who calls himself Armik
commands a technique as dexterous and a sound as brightly appealing
as his work on this disc, he should find a large audience. Working in
a hybrid idiom that combines elements of flamenco, Latin jazz and
acoustic pop, Armik unfurls a series of impressionistic tone poems
that might easily serve as a soundtrack for a particularly
atmospheric film or TV show. Yet it would be a mistake to dismiss
original tunes such as the murmuring "Treasures From Spain" or the
lush "Bolero Passion" as mere background music--Armik's guitar
playing is too stylish, his technique too nimble and his musicianship
too thorough for that. Although one hopes that on his next recording
Armik might try for greater contrast among the tunes, the poetry of
his playing is undeniable.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   CHICO FREEMAN Y GUATACA</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, By the Way"</TE>
<TE>   Challenge</TE>
<TE>   Too young to be admired as an elder statesman and too old to be
considered a young lion, saxophonist Freeman belongs to a now
middle-aged generation of accomplished jazz artists who never
received quite the acclaim they deserved. Nevertheless, during the
past couple of decades, Freeman has explored a wide range of jazz
idioms, and his work with his Afro-Caribbean band Guataca proves
persuasive and, at times, distinctive. Although Freeman's attempt to
mix Afro-Cuban dance with American hip-hop on "Mambo Rap" probably
will not delight fans of either genre, there's no resisting the
mixture of ancient and modern dance rhythms on "New African Village,"
the seductive flamenco style of "Guitar," or the soaring lyricism of
"La Luna." Once again, Freeman reaffirms his status as a jazz
saxophonist for all occasions.</TE>

<HD>A Latino Flowering</HD>
<DH>As our cultures blend, the surge in fare with a Latin
American bent is a natural, programmers say</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT TIMBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's either the zeitgeist, or shameless demographic pandering, or
some of both. But the 2002-03 arts season is something of a
high-water mark for Southland arts organizations offering Latin
American and Latino fare. There's no cabal, no concerted effort to
bring so much Latin work to town--some of it is passing through as
part of regular national tours, some of it is business as usual at
institutions such as the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach,
or the just reopened Latino Museum of History, Art and Culture in
downtown L.A.</LD>
<LD>   But many offerings have the flavor of special events. Two weeks of
programming from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, dubbed "Latin
Influence on U.S. Culture," will feature a world premiere by Mexican
composer Gabriela Ortiz alongside Silvestre Revueltas' "Redes," in
January. March sees three dates devoted to John Adams' "El Nino," a
choral retelling of the birth of Christ that uses Spanish verse from
an 18th century nun, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, whom Adams calls
"Mexico's Emily Dickinson, but 200 years earlier." Chamber music from
Latin America, a Revueltas documentary, and poetry readings are also
part of the Philharmonic's package.</LD>
<TE>   About an hour south, the Eclectic Orange Festival will offer
almost two solid months, starting in October, concentrating on the
arts of Latin America: Cuarteto Latinoamericano will play music from
Piazzolla's tangos to Villa-Lobos' Brazilian-flavored works; the
Orquesta Sinfonica Nacional de Mexico and the Orquestra de Sao Paulo,
in its U.S. debut, will also perform mostly Latin American repertory.
The festival will also spotlight the West Coast premiere of
Argentine-born composer Osvaldo Golijov's "Passion According to St.
Mark" ("La Pasion Segun San Marcos").</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA and in Orange County, the Kronos Quartet is playing music
from its CD "Nuevo." The Long Beach Symphony will have Latin
composers on all but two of its six programs, and in November, the
First International Latino Theatre Festival will take over the Japan
America Theatre, highlighted by a summit of 70 playwrights, directors
and actors, an academic symposium and 11 theater companies from nine
countries presenting plays.</TE>
<TE>   The cultural action isn't confined to performance. One major
offering, the San Diego Museum of Art's just opened survey, "Axis
Mexico: Common Objects and Cosmopolitan Actions," focuses on young
artists making an international splash.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is happening in a vacuum. The demographic reality is
well known: In Los Angeles County, according to the 2000 U.S. Census,
44.6% of the population is of Latino origin, and the percentage of
Latinos with household incomes above $75,000 a year has more than
doubled in 10 years, to 14.4%. Orange County has a smaller Latino
population (30.9%), but a higher percentage (21.6%) in high-income
brackets.</TE>
<TE>   Across the U.S., the impact of Latin culture has been on an
upswing for a while. The third annual Latin Grammy Awards will take
place Wednesday at the Kodak Theatre. Similarly, the Mexican films
"Amores Perros" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien" have received enormous
attention. Coming up: a Sundance hit with a mostly Latino cast, "Real
Women Have Curves," opens Oct. 18, and "Frida," a film based on the
life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, starring Salma Hayek and Alfred
Molina, opens Oct. 25.</TE>
<TE>   But arts impresarios, pushed to explain this season's confluence
of Latino events, mostly point to aesthetics. Sandy Robertson,
associate director of the Orange County Philharmonic Assn., presenter
of the Eclectic Orange Festival, says a Latin theme for a music-heavy
festival was "an easy call."</TE>
<TE>   "It came partly because there's a very authentic and energetic
blending of the indigenous culture with the European classical
tradition," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique Arturo Diemecke, a native of Mexico, is the recently
appointed music director at the Long Beach Symphony and the longtime
leader of the Orquesta Sinfonica Nacional de Mexico. He has spent his
career balancing his love of European classical music--especially
Mahler--with the Mexican and South American tradition. The Long Beach
season--the first entirely of his devising--includes pieces by
Chavez, Villa-Lobos, the Spaniard De Falla, and Diemecke's own Don
Quixote-inspired "Camino y Vision," as well as the usual European
evergreens.</TE>
<TE>   "In Southern California, people seem to want to know about these
composers, they want to see more," Diemecke says by phone from
Mexico. "I've done [Latin-American music] a lot with the L.A.
Philharmonic, and I have experienced that audiences really enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   He had especially good luck with a program of Revueltas and
Ginastera at the Hollywood Bowl; he was met not only with a packed
house and thunderous applause, but also requests for another, similar
program. "Everybody just went crazy. It's not what I have experienced
in other parts of the world. It's funny to see that on the East Coast
or the Midwest. They say, 'That's OK, but that's enough.' In Europe,
they're curious about a piece, but they're never curious about a
whole program."</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Borda, managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic,
says her orchestra's 2002-03 Latin program came in part from the 2001
Ojai Music Festival, "Music of and About the Americas," which
included works by Golijov, Revueltas, and Ortiz. Esa-Pekka Salonen
"has always had a relationship with the music of Revueltas," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   She also hopes that the programming could pull in new audiences.
"Our marketing department will be marketing these programs in
different ways, but it's too soon to know" what impact they'll have.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the impetus behind Eclectic Orange's Latin theme
was one piece of music: Golijov's "St. Mark" Passion, which got its
first rave reviews after its premiere in 2000 in Germany, and has
been gathering steam since. Pushing dance music to biblical
proportions, it's so strong, according to Robertson, that it demanded
other, similar works to give it context.</TE>
<TE>   Golijov, whose work has drawn from South American, European, and
Yiddish idioms, may be the poster boy for mixing musics across every
border. "Looking back to the past century, I see that what has
survived is not the product of dogmas but the music of shameless
opportunists like Stravinsky, Strauss, Ravel, [Alban] Berg,
Armstrong, Ellington, Miles Davis, the Beatles, etc.," he told The
Times in 2001. "It's a good lesson. Beware of ideology, if you have
something to say, say it with the means at your disposal at any given
moment.... At the moment, I think that the Latin American immigration
is a strong and irrepressible influence. Musically, it is
tremendously rich, as is all music that emerges from widely varied
sources. I'd say it's hard to ignore. On the other hand, America will
metabolize it and make it its own."</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco-based Kronos Quartet, whose own metabolizing
excursions have ranged from the delicate chamber jazz of Bill Evans
to the post-romantic pastiche of Alfred Schnittke, has recently dived
into an eclectic array of Latin American music. Its latest CD,
"Nuevo," released in April, reworks pieces from all over the Latin
American map, from Golijov to bachelor-pad guru Esquivel.</TE>
<TE>   "You can hear the distant past and the future all at the same
time," Kronos violinist David Harrington says of what drew him to the
music in Mexico. The group's first local performance from "Nuevo" was
Sept. 13 at UCLA, with an all-female mariachi band and a member of
Tijuana electronica combo the Nortec Collective. In October, Kronos
will play as part of Eclectic Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "The Zocalo, which is the main square in Mexico City--I lived
there for a couple weeks one time," Harrington says, "and I had the
most amazing experiences: In the very early morning we'd be awakened
by a military band as the flag was raised; there'd be young Aztec
dancers later in the day, maybe a rock group in the afternoon, then
the bells of the cathedral. And right under the cathedral are the
remains of an Aztec temple, with Diego Rivera murals right there.
That amazing sense of time. There's an amazing amount of music that
takes place in a very small location."</TE>
<TE>   Harrington has been studying Mexican music for about seven years.
"Nuevo," he says, is the fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington guesses that the surge in Latin programming might be a
reaction to the U.S.' growing self-absorption. "In a time when a lot
of our country is not looking around very much, people in the
artistic process are realizing how important it is to continue to
look at what surrounds us."</TE>
<TE>   Visual art may have entered a similar period of internationalism.
"Some art historians talk about this as a post-NAFTA age--a different
kind of awareness of the U.S. and the countries on its borders," says
Betti-Sue Hertz, who curated "Axis: Mexico," which concentrates on
two generations of artists who she says have left irony,
self-conscious nationalism and the medium of painting behind.</TE>
<TE>   "There's also been a huge influx of Mexican art into the States,"
Hertz says, and some of this comes from a push by Mexican President
Vicente Fox, who increasingly uses the cultural ministry as a
diplomatic tool to woo U.S. interest.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Mexican government has been aggressive recently about
pushing Mexican culture, whether funding tours or arranging
exhibitions. A show of art from Mexico's Spanish colonial period,
which originated at Mexico City's Franz Mayer Museum with the
blessing of the Fox government, is touring the States. A four-week
festival of Mexican music coming to the Kennedy Center in Washington
next spring was funded in part by the Mexican government. The Fox
government reportedly has made use of "Y Tu Mama Tambien," hardly a
flattering portrait of Mexico, as a symbol of cultural achievement.</TE>
<TE>   Besides mainstream institutions waking up to Latin-flavored art,
venues with long-standing commitments to the form are going strong.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is long overdue," Gregorio Luke, director of the
Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach and a serious fan of
Mexican music, says of the offerings. "And the main reason for it is
that Latin America has been so stereotyped in the past. You tell
people about Mexican music, and they picture a hat band, or a
mariachi band." But programs from the Philharmonic and Eclectic
Orange--as well as the Latin American art museum's musical schedule,
which includes an Oct. 25 festival of troubadour-style canto
nuevo--will show audiences how much range Mexican music covers.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Mexican nationalist composers like Revueltas and
Chavez have developed a profile, Luke says, music of Mexico's
romantic period is only just now getting a hearing in the U.S. and
even Mexico. "Mexicans were playing beautiful waltzes that were later
played in Vienna," says Luke, explaining that romanticism was
suppressed after Mexico's revolution. "It was considered reactionary,
bourgeois. People have no idea that this stuff existed; it's like a
secret."</TE>
<TE>   The spokeswoman for the International Latino Theatre Festival,
Pilar Marrero, says it's high time for such an event in L.A.; Miami,
New York and Texas all have similar festivals, she says. "Los Angeles
has the largest Latino community; it's just unconscionable that L.A.
does not have a similar event."</TE>
<TE>   The scheduling of her festival is also due, she says, to the heavy
attendance of the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival,
which just marked its sixth year in July. "It's proof that the Latino
community does not just watch TV and listen to commercial radio,"
Marrero says. "People go out to films in droves." She expects the
theater festival to draw mostly, though not exclusively, Latinos,
because the plays will be in Spanish or Portuguese.</TE>
<TE>   Why the convergence in 2002? "It's not out of the kindness of
anybody's heart," says the Museum of Latin American Art's Luke. "It's
like what happened to Italian Americans 50 years ago--a bigger middle
class. There's a massive market out there that's totally untapped and
ready to go. As soon as you open the door, there's a flood."</TE>
<TE>   Diemecke is not so sure why mainstream institutions have suddenly
woken up to his longtime interest.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know, it's a good question," he says. But how to respond
is easy: "I think it's a great opportunity," he says, "and we should
take it."</TE>

<DH>What is this unusual show? Talking Heads' David Byrne seeks
viewer input in his photo exhibition</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL USLAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Help David Byrne solve a puzzle. What's his latest photography
installation going to look like?</LD>
<LD>   The artist, muscian and former Talking Heads frontman has placed a
computer at the center of the exhibition, where hundreds of his
images will be displayed in a portfolio of thumbnails. Viewers will
be able to search through what Byrne calls a "Victorian cabinet of
wonders on a hard drive" for the one that speaks to them. They can
either buy it, in the form of a computer printout, or with the help
of a gallery assistant, print a copy to display as part of the
exhibition.</LD>
<LD>   In this way, through viewer-by-viewer impulses, "Elective
Affinities (A Trade Show Demonstration)," which opened Saturday at
Track 16 Gallery in Santa Monica, will grow from "a seemingly random
set of images to groupings that focus on a narrower set of things,
places and forms," Byrne explains in an e-mail interview. "Kind of
like a puzzle, but one that only reveals its subject as it nears
completion."</LD>
<TE>   But as for what this puzzle will reveal, neither the enigmatic
Byrne nor the gallery offers any specifics: "That part is hard for me
to say--maybe easier for you to see," Byrne says. "We don't really
want people to know what to expect," says Laurie Steelink, who
organized the exhibition at Track 16.</TE>
<TE>   Byrne does say he will "try to encourage similarly focused
pictures to be grouped together; they resonate off one another more
that way and make things a little clearer." But how exactly he'll
offer this encouragement also remains undisclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Although Byrne, 50, says he was "sucked into" music and art at
around the same time, in the late 1960s, his career as an exhibiting
photographer has developed post-Talking Heads. His photos were first
shown in 1990, at a group exhibition in Tokyo, two years after
Talking Heads released their last album of new material. "Elective
Affinities" marks his first solo art show in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Like Byrne's music, his photographs defy easy categorization. He
often processes his photos with techniques such as the
color-enhancing Cibachrome or combines them with digital effects. He
frequently mixes text with images, usually bringing the same
cerebral, ironic tone that has defined much of his songwriting. Many
of his images involve everyday settings and objects in incongruous
contexts--oddly cropped or positioned. The results are extremely
varied: 12 hotel rooms, shown in a tight group, every one competing
for world's ugliest bedspread. (Viewed by themselves, the patterns
don't seem so offensive). A giant pair of scissors hovering in the
sky above an iconic-looking farm. Parking lots and cafeterias devoid
of human beings. What appear to be Lady Di's eyes--and a bit of the
bridge of her nose.</TE>
<TE>   That's only a glimpse inside Byrne's cabinet of wonders.</TE>
<TE>   In "Elective Affinities," he wants viewers to spend time searching
through that cabinet considering what he calls his "visual
note-taking." In this way, he is hoping to foster "thinking in a
nonverbal language--a language we are all addressed in, but one that
most of us don't speak."</TE>
<TE>   Byrne knows an exhibition with viewer participation has risks, but
that's hardly a deterrent to a man who first took to the stage in
junior high with a ukulele in hand. "Audience participation can be
unpleasant and gimmicky, so it's a tricky kind of balancing act to
pull it off," he admits. "When it works, everyone feels more involved
and incorporated than ever. When it doesn't, everyone just squirms
and feels uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   In this case, Byrne hopes his audience will not only experience
firsthand how the accumulation of images on a wall can change the
look and meaning of an exhibition, but also learn something about
artistic process. What they learn won't necessarily be positive, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll see, and possibly be disillusioned by, a machine
producing a photo. Not that they haven't seen digital printers
before, but to accept that digital prints might be 'fine art' might
be a big leap for some. And to have it be so obvious," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The public often prefers the myth of the presence of the artist's
hand--the sense that the artist self-labored long and hard and
oversaw every step of the production--a leftover from drawing and
painting [and] earlier photography," he says. "I have actually
overseen the technical, printing and color adjustments on all of
these, but once those decisions are made, it is a truly mechanical
reproduction."</TE>
<TE>   So why involve the viewers in the exhibition's evolving meaning
only to potentially distract them with a disillusioning process? "Why
do I want to possibly sabotage my own show? People don't want to see
what's behind the curtain, do they? But we'll see," he responds.</TE>
<TE>   Byrne has long been making and breaking his own rules as he has
sought ways to grab our attention and pull us out of our insular
worlds. As an art student at the Rhode Island School of Design in the
early 1970s, Byrne used a variety of conceptual art techniques to do
just that.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his work, he says, "incorporated photos--evidence of UFOs,
portraits of classmates, etc. But most of it was text-based, like
questionnaires, lists of commonly accepted--or possibly
accepted--truths. Transcriptions of game shows as literature, taped
phone conversations over unmoving video images, drawings on
Etch-a-Sketch toys, shots of suburban tract homes overlaid with taped
phone conversations of me and my friends talking to their parents."</TE>
<TE>   Art school is also where Byrne formed a band called the Artistics
with fellow students Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. With Byrne on
lead vocals and guitar, the band turned into Talking Heads and,
adding Jerry Harrison to the lineup, made its debut in 1975,
supporting the Ramones at CBGB in New York City. The rest is 17 years
of well-known new-wave music history.</TE>
<TE>   As a solo artist, Byrne has frequently jumped musical boundaries,
especially through his incorporation of sounds and rhythms from
around the globe. In 1989, he founded a record label, Luaka Bop, as a
way of sharing his enthusiasm for Brazilian music. No matter the
medium, Byrne seems dedicated to culling inspiration from the world
and compiling the elements in unconventional ways: a Cajun song that
features sitars; Luaka Bop's "Afropea" compilation (a combo of
European and African musics); or a picture, in the current
exhibition, of a truck with the caption "She's a beauty, mate!"</TE>
<TE>   "When something makes us feel strange, it often makes us feel good
too. The two sensations are somehow linked," Byrne writes in the end
notes of his 1995 photography collection, "Strange Ritual." "The
camera helps this sensation to happen. It becomes a machine for
investing these places and things with power, a device for removing
things from their mundane context. They become more than what they
once were. More special, more valuable, more powerful. They stand for
something beyond themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Steelink cites that power to infuse images with meaning as her
reason for suggesting a show of his work to Track 16 owner Tom
Patchett.</TE>
<TE>   "I find his process stimulating, and the collecting of images
bordering on something other than just 'art.' You're forced to read
between the lines. It's like an experiment in a language you don't
understand," she says.</TE>
<TE>   As the puzzle begins to come together, it can speak in no shortage
of ways.</TE>
<TE>   "When you step back from it," Steelink says, it should "reveal a
dialogue and pictorial history of human nature, in all its odd,
glorious color, with the grotesque and the beautiful side by side."</TE>

<DH>A new book celebrates the 'graphic wonderland' of
exploitation film posters</DH>

<LD>"Dracula's Dog." "The Pusher." "Scorchy." "Honky." "Teen-age
Jailbait." "Son of Blob." "Free Grass." "Werewolf in a Girls'
Dormitory."</LD>
<LD>   The id of Hollywood's psyche comes alive in "Trash: The Graphic
Genius of Xploitation Movie Posters," a new release from Chronicle
Books celebrating ads for beyond-the-pale films from the 1950s
through the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Guiding readers by the popcorn-clutching hand, the book comes on
like a car wreck with a look-if-you-dare attitude. It's the work of
Jacques Boyreau, whose archive, Cosmic Hex, contains hundreds of
films and thousands of movie posters from which "Trash" is drawn.</LD>
<TE>   Co-founder of San Francisco's Werepad, an underground "cinema
space and cosmic lounge," Boyreau has been a serious collector for 10
years. He believes the glory days of movie art faded away decades
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "A-list movies have helped themselves to the tricks of
exploitation, but what they've not helped themselves to is the
graphic [guts] of the design. Hollywood is just bursting with
creativity. But I hardly ever see anything in poster art today that's
more than a glorified head shot. In terms of text, the sledgehammer
is still operative, but I miss the graphics. It's like Hitchcock
title sequences--that's a graphic wonderland I just don't see
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Heavy-duty studio marketing kills visual creativity, Boyreau said.
"I knew a guy who was in on the 'GoodFellas' posters. He said it's a
committee making totally innocuous art--do we need 100 people to make
it as bland as it is? It's lame. I call it the gulags of market
research."</TE>
<TE>   "Trash," which was released last month and has sold out its first
printing of 12,000, attempts to bring back some of the visual sizzle
that Boyreau has missed since his fascination with celluloid began.</TE>
<TE>   "I was lucky. I had a cool dad and he took me to rep houses around
Chicago," he recalls. So, before I was 10 I had seen everything from
'The Wild Bunch' to 'On the Waterfront,' 'The Treasure of Sierra
Madre' and 'The Adventures of Robin Hood.' I didn't see them on TV
but in all their big-screen glory."</TE>
<TE>   Boyreau's father, who was French, instilled in his son a love of
all films. But there's a special dark, dank little spot in Boyreau's
heart for those twisted, offbeat, sexy, violent, over-the-top
exploitation flicks. "Growing up in Chicago, I got the real McCoy in
the last of the exploitation grind houses," Boyreau said. A sneak
preview of "Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold," starring Tamara
Dobson and Stella Stevens, was inspirational.</TE>
<TE>   "It made an impression," he said solemnly.</TE>
<TE>   A visual cornucopia of cheese and sleaze oozes over the pages of
"Trash." It's a riot of color and a variety of styles, from slick
studio stills to op-art, clip art, psychedelia, cartoon, fantasy and
sci-fi images. Show-stopping taglines match the eye candy:</TE>
<TE>   "Black Cobra": How much snake can one woman take?</TE>
<TE>   "The Thing With Two Heads": They transplanted a white bigot's head
onto a soul brother's body! The doctor blew it.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaft in Africa": The brotherman in the motherland.</TE>
<TE>   A poster from "Deliverance" tucks in alongside other more "legit"
films such as "Panic in Needle Park," "The Omega Man," "Black Like
Me," "The President's Analyst," "Mad Max" and "Escape From New York."
Boyreau decided to include those titles because of subject matter and
how the posters sold the movies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting to bring in so-called 'legit,' " Boyreau said. "
'Deliverance' is about two grotesque mountain men raping Ned Beatty
and the guys getting arrows shot through them. It's the most seminal
redneck psycho rampage movie, and so many movies have taken their
lead from the film--like 'The Hills Have Eyes' or 'Walking Tall.' "</TE>
<TE>   Chapters in the book sort the rubbish into convenient recycling
containers: sex trash, action trash, horror trash, groovy trash, race
trash and docu trash.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the posters, kept lovingly for years by Boyreau and
friends, show white creases where they have been carefully folded.</TE>
<TE>   "An Amazon.com reviewer who seemed like a super, Uber nerd
collector said, 'They're not in mint condition,' and yes, technically
speaking, they've been around the block," Boyreau said. "We're into
breaking them out of the museum prison. Our approach is they should
be circulating and these folds are the wrinkles of time. I think it's
a nice touch. There's a utilitarian quality to exploitation posters
that we want to preserve and wallow in."</TE>
<TE>   Wallow fittingly describes the feeling of flipping through
"Trash." It's a funky flashback for anyone who lived through these
decades, a scrapbook chronicling the careers of once big and now
often forgotten actors such as Senta Berger, Richard Roundtree,
Adrienne Barbeau, Marjoe Gortner, Nancy Kwan, Tisa Farrow, Nastassja
Kinski, Tony Franciosa, Michael J. Pollard, Susan Saint James, Telly
Savalas, Tom Laughlin, Chuck Connors, Elke Sommer and the queen of
the '70s movie, Karen Black.</TE>
<TE>   "Trash" also treasures posters with classy actors slumming it:
James Mason in "Kill, Kill, Kill"; Yul Brynner and Max Von Sydow in
"Ultimate Warrior"; Anthony Perkins in "Pretty Poison"; Marlon
Brando, Richard Burton and John Huston in "Candy"; Julie Harris, Eli
Wallach and Hal Holbrook in "The People Next Door"; Joseph Cotten and
Stuart Whitman in "Guyana--Cult of the Damned"; Tommy Lee Jones in
"Rolling Thunder"; and Lauren Hutton, Red Buttons and Gene Kelly in
"Viva Knievel!"</TE>
<TE>   Why shouldn't big names jump on the bandwagon? Boyreau says
"Gladiator," "Hannibal," "Bring It On," "Jurassic Park" and "Eyes
Wide Shut" are "high-falutin' grandiose forms" of established
exploitation genres.</TE>
<TE>   "Its influence is so widespread, you can't see the trees for the
forest," Boyreau said.</TE>
<TE>   Take the upcoming mega-budget epic about Alexander the Great by
Australian director Baz Luhrmann. "It's been done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the late '50s and early '60s, there were these big-budget
sword-and-sandal movies and then came sillier ones from Italy.
Richard Burton was in 'Alexander.' Watch 'Cleopatra' and suddenly you
realize--what is it if not exploitation, even with its learned
yearning to be Shakespeare? The scenes that stick with you are the
down-and-dirty, messy, sensual ones. Those are the ones that put
their mitts on ya."</TE>
<TE>   But lest readers think he completely worships the genre, Boyreau
offers this tip for enjoying exploitation flicks. "I personally
recommend that people invest in a second VCR and watch them two at a
time. Turn off the sound for one movie and it becomes a visual
accompaniment for the other. It works well with movies that aren't
worthy of your entire attention."</TE>
<TE>   The movies might seem disposable, but Boyreau sees "Trash" as a
book for the ages. "I'm in my mid-30s but I look out 20 years from
now and I envy the point of view of some kid who sees this book and
enters into a whole new galaxy thinking, 'Can this be legal?' "</TE>

<HD>Power Trade Slump May Hit Consumers</HD>
<DH>Energy: Lack of deals, possible shortages could mean higher
prices as merchants struggle and plant-building slows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Western electricity traders gathered in Ojai in June for their
industry group's annual meeting, the masters-of-the-universe attitude
was gone.</LD>
<LD>   Traders, who in the age of Enron Corp. seemed to rule the energy
world, complained they were spending more time defending against
market-manipulation lawsuits and investigations than they were buying
and selling electrons. "It was pretty glum," acknowledged Gary
Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, the
Menlo Park, Calif.-based trade group.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the energy trading sector has staggered through a
summer of financial disaster that has badly shaken the business.</LD>
<TE>   The year has brought accusations of questionable accounting and
trading practices, stubbornly low electricity prices, deep losses,
abrupt executive departures and widespread layoffs as companies
scaled back or abandoned electricity trading. Energy merchants are
mounting the equivalent of a giant yard sale of energy assets and
have postponed or canceled the construction of scores of power
plants.</TE>
<TE>   The pain has been severe for the companies, their employees and
shareholders. But there are even wider implications from the
meltdown, including potential electricity shortages and a lack of
good energy deals for big industrial users and others, which could
eventually mean higher costs for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   The trading of energy products might seem to be an esoteric
enterprise far removed from the daily business of flicking light
switches. However, energy trading firms also build power plants. With
the companies in such sorry financial shape, they are pulling the
plug on plant-building programs and eliminating projects capable of
generating 86,000 megawatts of electricity nationwide. During the
last two years, projects that could generate an additional 90,000
megawatts have been put on hold, according to Platts, an energy
research company. (One megawatt can power about 750 homes.)</TE>
<TE>   More of the canceled or postponed power plants were in California
than any other state, Platts said, with total potential production
capacity at about 19,000 mega-watts. Calpine Corp. of San Jose was
most aggressive in the nationwide pullback, followed by Duke Energy
Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the boom is over and we're in a bust," said Brian Jordan,
director of North American electricity markets at Platts. "When the
bust becomes so severe and a lot of plants are being killed or
postponed, that suggests that the next boom-bust cycle will be even
more severe."</TE>
<TE>   California's Supply</TE>
<TE>   Although the nation as a whole will have more electricity than it
needs until 2006, California may begin experiencing power shortages
after 2003, said Christopher Ellinghaus, energy analyst with Williams
Capital Group, a New York investment bank, who recently completed a
market-by-market study of electricity supply.</TE>
<TE>   The California Energy Commission on Wednesday licensed a
600-megawatt power plant in Hayward, which Calpine is scheduled to
begin building early next year for operation in 2005. But a Calpine
spokesman said Thursday that the company won't build the $400-million
plant unless it can sign long-term power contracts for the juice
electricity the facility would produce.</TE>
<TE>   The California Energy Commission, however, is not ready to send up
warning flares, despite the cancellation or postponement of several
power plants. Some of the proposals were not all that serious anyway,
said Claudia Chandler, assistant executive director of the
commission. "It's not the market that people thought it was when
everyone thought they could make a bazillion dollars in power plant
development. Now we're seeing the real developers."</TE>
<TE>   "Power plants are being built," Chandler said, adding 2,766
megawatts in the year ended July 31 with 3,643 megawatts to be added
in the next fiscal year. "We are OK through the end of 2004, though
we are watchful of 2005."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, power trading has shriveled. Platts estimates
that trading in some key daily and forward electricity markets has
fallen as much as 70% from a year ago. This may not make much of a
difference to California power users, forbidden by law from seeking
the best deal for electricity on the open market, at least for now.
But some market-watchers say the declining number of energy merchants
also has affected the sale of natural gas, which was deregulated in
the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, some large customers have a harder time getting
energy contracts signed with energy middlemen, or at least on the
terms they would like, consultants say. And with a slowdown in the
trading of energy derivatives, which are contracts based on the
future price of a commodity, big energy users are having trouble
hedging against large price movements.</TE>
<TE>   Higher Energy Costs</TE>
<TE>   Large industrial and commercial customers usually secure their own
supply of natural gas, but residential and small-business customers
are served by utilities such as Southern California Gas Co., a unit
of Sempra Energy. Higher energy costs for large industrial and
commercial users can be expected to eventually reach the consumer
through higher prices or fewer jobs, if corporate profits suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's becoming much more difficult to get deals done," said one
consultant, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid annoying his
clients. "Until late last year you could do a one-or two-year deal
over the phone very quickly and you could have multiple parties
within fractions of a cent of each other. You knew you were getting a
decent price."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County went shopping for natural gas 2 1/2 years ago
and found nearly 20 companies vying for the contract to supply the
county's many facilities. When the county went back to the market in
June, only two firms were willing to offer the kind of fixed-rate
contract that the county sought to shield against the gas price
spikes of two winters ago, said county energy manager Howard Choy.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no real competition, nobody having those portfolios
where they can mix and match to create savings," Choy said. Instead,
the county got a fixed price based on the published cost of producing
gas plus transportation. "If somebody is really trying to stick it to
us, we know it, but at the same time, we're not getting any great
deal," he said. Still, compared with the extraordinarily high prices
paid in the winter of 2000-2001, "we look like geniuses," Choy
quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Gas spokeswoman Denise King said energy
trading problems have not hindered the utility's ability to buy
natural gas for its customers.</TE>
<TE>   A Blow to Deregulation</TE>
<TE>   The trading industry's struggle was a blow to the deregulation
movement and competition's promise of lower prices and more consumer
choice--now an impossible sell in California. Several states that
considering opening their utilities to competition have slammed on
the brakes, but federal energy regulators recently signaled a plan to
open electricity markets and transmission nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a loss of momentum," said Ken Malloy, chief
executive of the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets, a
pro-competition think tank. About 10 states remain committed to
energy industry restructuring and 15 others had been considering
opening their monopoly utilities to outside competition but are now
"frozen in place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Cooper, energy analyst at the Consumer Federation of America,
considers that good news. "It proves something very important: There
are certain public values embedded in electricity and
telecommunications and other utilities that are not well-suited to
the market mentality that these traders thrived on," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   The fast-growing, largely unregulated businesses of energy trading
and power generation and the high electricity prices that fed them
seemed like a party that would never end. Now that it has, these same
companies are scrambling to look like traditional utilities again to
regain Wall Street's favor.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite interesting how poorly the financial community
understood this business," said Lawrence J. Makovich, a senior
electricity consultant at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "The
market was rewarding trading and merchant power in spite of some
clear evidence that there were big problems here."</TE>
<TE>   Trader woes began with a collapse in electricity prices last year
that was exacerbated by the economic malaise after Sept. 11. Then
followed a fast-spreading contagion in the industry known as
Enronitis: The disintegration late last year of the world's largest
energy trader drained confidence in the energy trading business and
sucked liquidity from the energy market, which operates on an
enormous amount of cash and short-term credit.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street credit raters re-evaluated the industry and
methodically slashed the debt rating of most market players deep into
"junk" territory. Hard hit were the major power sellers, including
AES Corp., Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp., Reliant
Energy Inc. and Williams Cos. Other traders also have been hurt, such
as Calpine, which won much praise from Gov. Gray Davis for building
some key power plants in the state.</TE>
<TE>   When will this sector improve?</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street analysts figure the trading business has been
through the worst but will limp along for a year or more with the
possibility of a few major corporate wipeouts to come. Others warn of
more weakness ahead among energy trading companies that already have
lost more than $200 billion of market value.</TE>
<TE>   "Few doubt that one or more energy merchant companies may soon
file for bankruptcy," Standard &amp; Poor's analyst Peter Rigby wrote in
a recent report.</TE>
<TE>   The business that survives will look different with new players,
new business models and new regulations. Bank of America Corp., for
instance, plans to beef up its power-trading operations as are other
financial institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've hit the bottom in terms of trading volume and the
credit crunch that has caused many people to abandon power trading or
to cut back severely," said Ackerman of the power trading industry
group.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron is gone," he said. "What will replace it will be more
sophisticated trading with more open rules and more open reporting."</TE>

<HD>Serious Woes for U.S. Auto Makers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Will the great U.S. automotive companies, General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co., go the way of the steel industry and become lumbering
financial cripples, clinging to survival in the shadow of foreign
competitors?</LD>
<LD>   That's a serious question asked by many experts these days despite
what appears to be another highly successful year of record vehicle
sales for the industry. Consumers have never had it so good. U.S. and
foreign car and truck producers offer tremendous variety in the U.S.
market, low prices and attractive deals on financing.</LD>
<LD>   In an expansive mood, Toyota Motor Corp. said last week that it is
planning to build another plant in the U.S. "One more plant is small
talk, there will be more plants than one," Toyota Chairman Hiroshi
Okuda said.</LD>
<TE>   But GM and Ford won't be opening new plants. In fact, the big
Detroit companies have to close or modify factories in the next few
years if they are to bring their production in line with the numbers
of vehicles they can sell at a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Right now they are using zero-percent financing and liberal
discounts to sell cars and trucks and keep their factories running.
But they are not making much profit on those sales.</TE>
<TE>   And the investment markets are rendering judgments on their
plight. GM's stock price is down 28% in the last three months and
Ford's is down 39%. The total value of all shares of GM and Ford
combined is 60% of the market value of Toyota alone. Honda Motor Co.,
which has only one-third the annual sales of GM, has a larger market
value than that of GM.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. auto makers face a life-threatening problem. GM and Ford
and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler have huge liabilities
for pensions and health-care costs for hundreds of thousands of
retired workers. Those are called legacy costs.</TE>
<TE>   But Toyota, Honda and other foreign firms manufacturing cars and
trucks in the U.S. do not have such liabilities and may not have them
for many years because their work forces are younger. Also, their
health and pension benefit bills are nowhere near as large as those
of the U.S. firms, which have more retirees than active workers.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, GM and Ford are at a long-term competitive
disadvan-tage. "Every new plant Toyota opens reduces GM and Ford's
profit potential," says Maryann Keller, an independent automotive
analyst. That's because Toyota, Honda and Nissan Motor Co., the big
three of Japan, are producing SUVs, pickup trucks and vans in their
U.S. plants. Those are the very products that gave U.S. auto-motive
companies good profits in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But profits are down from their boom-time highs. And the stock
market's two-year decline is hurting the returns on GM and Ford's
pension funds.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, GM may have to inject $16 billion into its pension
fund over the next four years and Ford may have to put in $4 billion
to $5 billion, according to a study by investment banking firm
Goldman Sachs. That promises to limit the firms' potential profit
growth.</TE>
<TE>   The companies, led by GM, are taking drastic action. One reason GM
introduced no-interest financing after Sept. 11 last year was because
running the plants and producing more cars led to lower costs per
car, partially offsetting the costs of low-interest loans to
customers. Also, cutting back production would not have saved money
because GM, Ford and Chrysler's unionized work forces collect almost
all their regular wages and benefits when plants are shut down
temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   GM's move, directed by Chief Executive G. Richard Wagoner Jr., who
has brought in top executives from other firms to revive the big auto
maker, is the first phase of a larger strategy, says consultant David
Andrea of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bridge to allow the company to gain market share and then
introduce new models with more profit, while working to get costs
down and rationalize production," Andrea says.</TE>
<TE>   GM's vehicles have 28.5% of the U.S. market, in which 17 million
vehicles are sold annually. Ford's share is about 22%.</TE>
<TE>   But Toyota's market share is more than 10%, and that of imports
and foreign cars produced in the U.S. by all companies is more than
38% and growing.</TE>
<TE>   It is critical that the U.S. firms come back to profitable and
competitive operations. And there are signs that they can do so. GM
has improved its production efficiency, measured in hours to produce
a single car or truck. It is still not as efficient as any of the
Japanese Big Three but it is gaining. And serious negotiations next
year with the United Auto Workers union will try to achieve long-term
solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Detroit must rediscover how to make appealing cars that can
be sold without big discounts.</TE>
<TE>   The big Detroit companies may not be the force in the U.S. economy
that they were decades ago, when GM sold one of every two vehicles in
the U.S. and employed double its current work force of 355,000. But
the industry, including suppliers to the U.S. Big Three, is still
very important. And it is suffering at the moment. Bankruptcy filings
among suppliers to U.S. auto makers are a spreading story in the
Midwest, automotive experts report.</TE>
<TE>   What if the U.S. companies can't return to solid profitability
while commanding about 60% of the U.S. market? Then the U.S.
government may have to step in to handle some of those legacy costs,
says economist Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The unequal burden of pensions and benefits is not simply the
result of union-management relations in Detroit, Shaiken says.
"Governments in the home countries of German and Japanese companies
finance pension and health-care costs. Those companies never shoulder
the burden that private firms do in the U.S.," Shaiken says, although
their U.S. subsidiaries provide benefits and pensions in the U.S.
pattern.</TE>
<TE>   But getting Congress to approve a bailout of union contract costs
would be tough because a new American auto industry has grown up
across the Southern states, where high-paying--but nonunion
--automotive jobs are replacing lower-wage textile employment.
Alabama soon will account for 3.5% of U.S. auto production; Nissan is
building a plant to pro-duce 400,000 vehicles in Missis-sippi. And
San Antonio believes it is a finalist for the next U.S. Toyota plant,
the company's fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Why are all the foreign firms making cars here? Because U.S.
purchasing power makes this just about the only market in a world of
auto production overcapacity in which a firm can make a real profit.
By some estimates Toyota, which sells 1.7 million vehicles in North
America--more than 750,000 of them produced in the U.S.--earns almost
all its profit in this market.</TE>
<TE>   How did once-powerful U.S. companies lose their hold on such a
market? Self-inflicted wounds are partly to blame. "In the 1990s,
when they made good profits, GM and Ford bought back shares to make
the mutual funds happy and support their stock prices," says analyst
Keller. "They should have used the money for product development."
Now mutual funds and other investors have downgraded the U.S. auto
companies, showing that it's not financial tricks but the potential
for profit and growth that commands investment markets.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Big Three, having learned hard lessons from competition,
have hard work to do.</TE>

does. There is one word that explains the success the union has had:
collusion.</LD>

their knees, and it is perfectly legal.</LD>
<TE>   If the owners, however, unite to try to instill some sanity back

judge and have the owners found guilty of conspiring against it.

<TE>   California Wine Industry</TE>
<TE>   Cheers to Rich Cartiere, who hit it on the "barrel" head with his
observation, "There is an enormous worldwide supply of wine, and the
[California] wine industry has just not adjusted" ["California's Wine
Glass Overfilled," Sept. 1].</TE>
<TE>   It truly is a new wine world where the closed-minded "Napa or
nothing" thinking has withered on the vine. Wine consumption in this
country continues to slide because of errors, not to mention "airs."
We have made wine out to be a much more complicated subject than need
be.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of high-profile producers continue to ignore the
warning signs, keeping their case prices--and noses--high.</TE>
<TE>   Sour grapes? No. Today, wine enthusiasts are discovering unique
and delicious offerings from lesser-known wineries along with
imports--from France's Bordeaux region, Italy, Australia, Chile,
etc.--available at affordable prices. The ultimate winners in this
grape glut are the wine consumers.</TE>

<TE>   Hate Junk Faxes?</TE>
<TE>   Call Them on It</TE>
<TE>   I had to share with you how I dealt with one obnoxious company
that sent me a junk fax at 3 a.m. ["Activists' Lawsuits Target Junk
Faxes," Aug. 23]. Mine is not at a business but in a home.</TE>
<TE>   There is always a message that asks you to call if you want to be
deleted from their mailing list. I'm sure that many frustrated people
have not been able to get through on the 800 numbers to have a fax
number deleted.</TE>
<TE>   What did I do? I called their sales order number--and again, no
person, but "leave a message" for them to get back to you. The
message I left was that I would call daily or more often on their 800
number if they did not remove me from their fax junk mail.</TE>
<TE>   How about if everyone called the sales numbers and left this sort
of message? It worked for me.</TE>

<HD>Keep It in Writing When Dealing With Identity Theft</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: A year ago, someone fraudulently applied for credit in my
name. I was tipped off by several diligent credit card companies. I
promptly placed fraud alerts with all three credit bureaus and
notified the local police department and Social Security office.</LD>
<LD>   One less-than-diligent firm, however, allowed the fraudster to
open an account after I had done all these things. I followed the
firm's instructions, sending it a notarized affidavit of fraud. The
account has disappeared from my credit reports, which I review
regularly, but I'm getting calls from a collection agency about it.
Is there anything else I should have done?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: You're seeing for yourself why people tear their hair out
over identity theft. You didn't do anything wrong, and yet you're
still battling to clear your name.</LD>
<TE>   The only thing that might have helped you would have been to
demand that the errant credit card firm write a letter to you
acknowledging that the account was not yours, said Jay Foley,
director of consumer and victim services for the Identity Theft
Resource Center. You should have requested this "letter of clearance"
when you sent in the fraud affidavit, Foley said.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, you should still ask for this letter and send it to the
collection agency. Send it certified mail, return receipt requested,
and keep a copy for your files.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, any time you deal with a serious credit problem, make
sure you communicate in writing (rather than by phone), keep a copy
of all documentation and use certified mail with return receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Foley said such precautions ensure that the creditor knows you are
serious about clearing up the problem. The return receipt makes it
tougher for creditors to deny having received your documentation, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on identity theft, check out the resource
center's Web site at www.idtheftcenter.org or the Federal Trade
Commission's site on the subject, www.consumer.gov/idtheft.</TE>

<TE>   Don't Keep Mortgage</TE>
<TE>   Just for the Write-Off</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you think of paying off a mortgage early? I recently
mentioned to a friend, who appears to be quite wealthy, that we were
on track to have our mortgage paid off in three years. Our idea is
that when our kids are ready for college in 2005, we would switch
from a monthly mortgage payment to a monthly tuition payment.</TE>
<TE>   We have been saving for college since they were born, but stock
market losses make us reluctant to rely on that alone for their
education. This friend, however, said we shouldn't pay off the house
because we would lose the "enormous" tax benefit of writing off the
interest payments. I respect her opinion because she appears to be
doing quite well and is a tax lawyer as well as a real estate agent.
On the other hand, we would like the security of a paid-off home.</TE>
<TE>   A: Apologies to your friend, but keeping a mortgage just for the
tax deduction is pretty silly.</TE>
<TE>   Think about it. Would you pay someone a dollar for the privilege
of getting back 27 cents? That's in essence what you're doing when
you pay a dollar of interest to get a tax break when you're in the
27% federal tax bracket.</TE>
<TE>   The payoff is higher when you're wealthy, because you're in a
higher bracket. But you'll never get a dollar's worth of tax benefit
for a dollar spent on interest.</TE>
<TE>   Because you're near the end of your loan, most of the payments
you're now making probably are principal. You don't get any tax break
on that portion of your payment.</TE>
<TE>   The better reason for not paying off a mortgage early is that you
typically can get a better return for your money elsewhere if you're
investing for the long term. If security is important to you,
however, and you're already investing for other goals, such as
retirement, then there's nothing really wrong with your plan.</TE>

<HD>New York a City in Flux as Its Economy Struggles</HD>
<DH>Jobs lost after the attack have yet to return, businesses
are cautious and government budgets are being cut</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Had the terrorists' goal been sheer economic destruction, they hardly
could have hit a bigger target.</LD>
<LD>   Where else in the United States--or the world, for that
matter--could such a strike cause losses approaching $100 billion?</LD>
<LD>   One year after the World Trade Center attack, New York City's
economy is struggling, lagging behind the nation in job creation and
economic output after several years of stock market-fueled
brilliance.</LD>
<TE>   Gotham's troubles are more than symbolic, however, because the
half-trillion-dollar regional economy represents about 5% of total
U.S. gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   Job losses due to the attack have been estimated at more than
86,000, including 13,000 jobs shifted to other areas, said the Fiscal
Policy Institute, a private research group. In a local economy of
more than 5 million jobs, that amounts to less than 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the attack, though, New York's economy was slowing,
partly because of the stock market's doldrums and a wave of layoffs
underway in the financial sector. Pushed largely by Sept. 11-related
job losses, the city's unemployment rate hit 8.0% in June, up from
5.7% a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan's downturn began in January 2001, two months ahead of
the nation's, said regional economist Jason Bram of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. The city's slump isn't officially over, but
experts are cautiously optimistic that New York will continue a
moderate recovery next year, along with the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Despite severe stress on municipal finances, the city's credit
ratings have held up well. Moody's Investors Service lowered its
outlook on the city's general obligation bonds to "negative" in
November, but did not downgrade the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Although experts say some economic effects of the terrorist attack
may continue for years, it's unlikely that the city will face a
financial meltdown like the one it endured in the 1970s. Even during
the '90s stock market boom, the city's budget projections were fairly
conservative, and so it hasn't fallen into a comparable debt squeeze,
Bram said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were told, 'We're going to have a recession, the stock
market's going to fall and the World Trade Center's going to be
destroyed,' you could imagine a much worse scenario for New York City
than what we see now," Bram said.</TE>
<TE>   The local industries hardest hit by the terrorist attack include
tourism, transportation, retailing, commercial real estate and, of
course, financial services.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Celia Chen, who follows New York for research firm
Economy.com, noted that finance, insurance and real estate
jobs--those most directly affected by the attack--represent 12% of
the metropolitan area's employment base but 32% of its income.</TE>
<TE>   City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. estimated the total cost
of the attack at $83 billion to $95 billion. Of that, $30.5 billion
represents property damage and lost "human capital," or the
productive capacity of the 2,800 people killed in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida in 1992 and
was the most expensive natural disaster in the U.S., caused total
losses of about $30 billion. Damage from the 1994 Northridge
earthquake was placed at about $20 billion.</TE>
<TE>   By Thompson's calculations, New York's "gross city product" over
the next two years will be down $25 billion to $37 billion because of
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The final tally, he said, will depend on how many relocated jobs
return to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Budget Gap</TE>
<TE>   The loss of tax revenue and additional expenses has hobbled city
government, costing an estimated $3 billion, which with the
already-weak economy, led to a $6-billion budget gap for the current
fiscal year--a shortfall that is being made up through borrowing and
spending cuts in city departments.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is slashing 20% from the budget of his
own office, aide Jordan Barowitz said. Libraries and cultural affairs
agencies face 10% cuts. The public safety and school departments will
fare slightly better, with cuts in the single digits, he said. "We're
doing as much as we can not to have it affect the quality of life,
but it gets increasingly difficult as more cuts need to be made,"
Barowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside assistance has been slow to have an effect, local
officials say. Although more than $21 billion in federal aid has been
pledged, only $2.7 billion has been released, according to
Comptroller Thompson's report.</TE>
<TE>   There also has been controversy over how the aid has been
targeted. One group representing small-shop owners in the devastated
Financial District contends that big Wall Street firms are getting a
disproportionate share of the aid--and getting it quicker--than
mom-and-pop retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Vacancy rates for prime commercial real estate in downtown
Manhattan more than doubled to 11.5% in July 2002 from a year
earlier, despite the elimination of 13 million square feet of office
space at ground zero and damage to a nearly equal amount of space in
the surrounding area.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have thought the destruction of so much property would
have firmed up demand," Chen said. Instead, a number of companies
moved workers north to Midtown or to New York or New Jersey suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street giants Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
for example, are maintaining a significant presence in the Financial
District, yet are shifting thousands of workers to New Jersey and
Westchester County, N.Y. The New York Stock Exchange dropped plans to
erect a new Wall Street headquarters and instead will split its
operations between its downtown site and a new facility at a
so-far-undisclosed location, but most likely not in Lower Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   To the relief of city officials, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. quickly
returned to the World Financial Center with most of its employees and
plans to stay there. Similarly, American Express Co. is in the
process of moving employees back to the Financial District; it
eventually will have 4,000 workers there, about the same number as
before the attack, spokeswoman Molly Faust said.</TE>
<TE>   More Complicated</TE>
<TE>   At street level, the situation may be more complicated.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown locksmith Peter Argese had several important commercial
customers in the World Trade Center. The attack wiped out those
accounts, at least temporarily, and reduced his overall business by
about one-third, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the havoc in Lower Manhattan brought Argese one
benefit: When declining sales forced a cellular telephone retailer
out of business in June, Argese was able to move into the vacated
storefront in the heart of the Financial District at a monthly rent
of $3,000--$2,000 less than the phone dealer had been paying.</TE>
<TE>   Better still, business is picking up at the shop, which employs
six people. "It was slow for a while, but now it's real busy," Argese
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Goldberg, principal of Bronx Builders, a contracting company
that specializes in high-end hotel and restaurant construction, lost
three employees at the World Trade Center, including the highly
skilled head of his millworking operation.</TE>
<TE>   The three men--immigrants from Paraguay, Portugal and
Romania--were visiting a prospective job site at Windows on the World
restaurant on the 107th floor of the North Tower when the plane
struck.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a level of disbelief," Goldberg said. "We closed down
the shop for about a week. Nobody had the heart to work."</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating an economic crash, some customers got cold feet,
canceling jobs that were all but underway, Goldberg said. Bronx
Builders, which has revenue of $12 million to $15 million a year, saw
business shrink about 15%, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg was forced to quickly scale down to 35 employees from 85
and subcontract a far larger portion of his work, he said. Business
has come back more strongly than he expected, but the climate has
changed for good.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more competitive now," Goldberg said. "Everybody's chasing
work more aggressively."</TE>
<TE>   The caution among some of Goldberg's restaurant and hotel clients
partly reflects the precipitous drop in tourism that followed the
Trade Center attack.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism Declines</TE>
<TE>   NYC &amp; Co., the city's tourism bureau, estimated that 32 million
tourists will visit New York this year, down from 37 million in 2000,
which will mean a decline of more than $2 billion in spending.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, foreign tourists have been replaced by domestic
visitors who don't stay as long or spend as much money, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Still, tourism and retailing rebounded fairly well, considering
how sharply they fell off just after the attack, said James Brown,
analyst for the New York State Labor Department.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance at Broadway shows, with the campy musical "Hairspray"
this season's hottest ticket, also has snapped back better than
expected. Several shows closed immediately after the attack, and it
took city subsidies and pay concessions from performers and
craftspeople to get the industry through a bleak fall and winter.</TE>
<TE>   New York's Chinatown has a lower economic profile than Broadway or
Wall Street, yet its chief businesses--restaurants, small retailers
and garment factories--were no less battered.</TE>
<TE>   Beset by lower-cost foreign competitors, the garment industry has
been shrinking for many years, but the attack accelerated the
process. The street blockades, which closed off the southern half of
Chinatown, made it impossible for many companies obtain fabric and
other materials or to deliver their finished goods.</TE>
<TE>   The big retailers that buy from the garment factories "may have
been looking for an excuse to cancel orders anyway," anticipating a
slow holiday shopping season, said James Parrott, chief economist for
the Fiscal Policy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Five months after the attack, at least 40 of the neighborhood's
246 garment factories had closed their doors for good and an
estimated 70% of apparel workers were working reduced hours,
according to a study by the Asian American Federation of New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinatown women's wear factory that employs Agnes Wong and
about 15 others was shut down for nearly four months and still is not
running at full capacity, Wong said. The Hong Kong native considers
herself lucky because, after 28 years in the low-wage industry, she
has accumulated enough savings to survive the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Despite wages that make it difficult to bring home more than $40
for a day's work, the garment industry is crucial to Chinatown's
quality of life, Wong said. It is one of the few businesses that
offers flexible hours for immigrants who don't speak English and have
young children at home.</TE>
<TE>   Small-Business Woes</TE>
<TE>   Farther south and also overshadowed by Wall Street, another group
is struggling for survival: the small-business owners of the
Financial District.</TE>
<TE>   From the Ground Up, an organization claiming 400 entrepreneur
members, has been pressuring government for quicker action on aid.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Anastasia Gagas, whose mail-forwarding business was
in the northeast corner of the World Trade Center complex, said $600
million in federal assistance has been earmarked for small businesses
hurt by the terrorist attack, but only a trickle has been delivered.</TE>
<TE>   She contended that city and state officials administering the
federal funds are responding faster, and more generously, to huge
Wall Street firms than to small-business owners.</TE>
<TE>   There is too much red tape involved in obtaining the government
aid and the amount provided is too small, she said. One program
offers a maximum payment equal to 25 days worth of sales.</TE>
<TE>   But for a merchant like her whose business has been shut since the
attack, it isn't enough. "Where's my other 300 days of sales?" she
asked.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, many shop owners are fighting their
insurers for payment of business interruption and property damage
claims, Gagas said.</TE>
<TE>   The plight of the small merchants isn't just an issue for the
entrepreneurs themselves, Gagas said. "People who work downtown want
to be able to go to lunch, get their shoes repaired, pick up office
supplies, but they can't--we're not there," she said.</TE>

<HD>Refinancing Auto Loan May Mean Big Savings</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers who think they can't capitalize on falling interest rates
because they don't own a house ought to talk to Corey Young. The
Brentwood medical-plan salesman refinanced his car loan in a
transaction that could save him about $1,300.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm always looking for a better value," he said. "I was curious
to know if I could refinance a used car and save money."</LD>
<LD>   Young is by no means alone. It used to be uneconomical to
refinance a car, but a combination of factors--including rapidly
falling interest rates--has created a booming market for auto
refinancing.</LD>
<TE>   In the past, auto refinancing rarely made sense because it
typically requires replacing a new-car loan with a used-car loan. And
because cars depreciate, cutting the value of the lender's
collateral, interest rates on used-car loans usually are so much
higher that refinancing was a money-losing proposition.</TE>
<TE>   But interest rates have fallen so far that used-car loans are
being offered at lower rates than new-car loans were two years ago,
experts note. That's creating opportunities for savvy borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 297,363 car owners refinanced, said Art Spinella, vice
president and general manager of CNW Marketing Research, a Bandon,
Ore.-based firm that tracks auto statistics. That's a 48% increase
from the previous year. And 2002 looks to be even bigger, with an
estimated 450,000 car owners trading in their loans.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always been a market for refinancing a car," said Thomas
P. Wirth, senior vice president of consumer lending at U.S. Bank in
Minneapolis. "But this year it's much more so because of the interest
rate cycle. You have people who took out car loans in 2001 and
2000--or even in 1999--who can benefit by refinancing their cars to a
lower rate."</TE>
<TE>   Young can attest to that. When he got his new Honda Accord two
years ago, the interest rate for a good credit risk was 8.9%, he
said. When he refinanced the loan recently, his interest rate fell to
6.03%.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike refinancing a house, in which the borrower probably will
pay thousands in appraisal and title insurance costs, there are few
fees associated with an auto refinance. The only fee Young paid was a
$15 lien transfer charge.</TE>
<TE>   "Auto refinancing is one of the best-kept secrets in finance,"
said Brian Reed, president of PeopleFirst, an online auto finance
firm. "Everybody thinks about refinancing their mortgage when
interest rates drop. But then they have to worry about how long it
will take to pay back the fees through monthly savings. With your
car, there really are no fees. If you can get a lower rate, you can
save money."</TE>
<TE>   The savings can be even more compelling for those who have had
credit problems but have worked to resolve them.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Ward Jewell, a Santa Monica architect. When he secured a
loan on his Audi Quattro two years ago, he was newly divorced and his
credit rating had suffered for it. The dealer charged a hefty 15.9%
on his $31,000 car loan, leaving him with a $767 monthly payment.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with his credit largely repaired, he has been able to
refinance the car at a 7.49% rate, cutting his monthly payment by
more than $100 to $652.42. The refinancing will save him more than
$4,500 over the remaining 40 months of the loan.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big change," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The only caveat: Some people are tempted to stretch the payment
term--getting a new five-year loan even though they had whittled down
the number of remaining payments. Stretching out the term costs you,
Spinella said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you stretch out the term of the deal, even if you're getting
a lower rate and lower monthly payments, you aren't necessarily
saving money," Spinella noted.</TE>
<TE>   Consider someone who financed a car with a $10,000 five-year loan
at 8%. The monthly payment would be about $203. If the borrower
refinanced the loan after making the first 12 payments, about $8,300
would remain on the loan. At a 6% rate, the payments would fall to
just less than $195 a month, with the original loan term--in other
words, 48 more payments. That would save the borrower nearly $400
over the life of the loan.</TE>
<TE>   However, if the borrower signed up for another five-year loan, the
monthly payment would drop to about $160, but payments would be made
for 12 additional months. That would cost $271 more than if he had
refinanced the loan and paid it off on the original repayment
schedule, and only slightly less than if he'd never refinanced.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers who want to refinance a car loan have several options.
In addition to PeopleFirst (www.peoplefirst.com), many banks and
credit unions offer car refinance loans, said Fritz Elmendorff, a
spokesman for the Consumer Bankers Assn. in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "Used-car loans are more available than they've been in a long
time," he said. "And there just aren't any fees to speak of when you
refinance."</TE>

<LD>Firms Observe 9/11 in Diverse Ways</LD>
<LD>   Flags flew at half-staff outside McDonald's Corp. restaurants.
Kmart Corp. opened late. General Motors Corp. did not advertise.
Retailers posted slower-than-usual sales. Theme park-goers
participated in moments of silence at Universal Studios. And auction
Web site EBay displayed a virtual flag on its home page.</LD>
<LD>   These were all signs that, despite President Bush's urging that
Americans go on with their lives, business was anything but usual on
the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   From office towers to factory floors, workers held silent vigils
and gathered around televisions to watch coverage of Sept. 11
observances, inventing a variety of ways to commemorate the date.</TE>
<TE>   Companies set aside rooms for quiet reflection or spirited
conversation. Some employers allowed workers to take time off without
pay, and a few even paid them to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Executives at Tyco Are Indicted</TE>
<TE>   Two former Tyco International Ltd. executives were accused of
systematically looting the conglomerate in a scheme that allegedly
netted them more than $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   In a criminal indictment and a civil suit filed in New York,
prosecutors charged that L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief
executive, and Mark H. Swartz, its former chief financial officer,
stole $170 million from Tyco by granting themselves loans and bonuses
that were not authorized by the company's directors.</TE>
<TE>   The charges, brought jointly by the Manhattan district attorney
and the Securities and Exchange Commission, are the latest moves by
prosecutors in what has been a wave of fraud allegations directed
against executives who once were among the most highly regarded
leaders in corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   A third Tyco executive, former chief corporate counsel Mark A.
Belnick, was separately charged with falsifying business records to
conceal company loans of more than $14 million, which he allegedly
used to buy homes.</TE>
<TE>   The three men pleaded not guilty to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan Warns on Federal Deficit</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a House panel that
the U.S. economy has borne up surprisingly well under the blows of
terror attacks, a stock crash and a sharp retreat in business
investment but faces a new threat in looming federal deficits that
could raise interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said Congress should extend federal spending controls
that are widely credited with having helped produce four straight
years of budget surpluses but are set to expire at the end of this
month.</TE>
<TE>   He sidestepped the politically charged question of whether the
need for renewed fiscal restraint required undoing portions of
President Bush's 10-year, $1.6-trillion tax cut, which Congress
approved last year. He also declined to speculate on the economic
cost of a protracted war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fed Official Urges Execs to Cut Own Pay</TE>
<TE>   A senior Federal Reserve official used a Sept. 11 memorial service
on Wall Street to excoriate U.S. corporate executives for paying
themselves too much and called on business leaders to cut their own
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Quoting the biblical admonition to "love thy neighbor as thyself,"
William J. McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank
and a possible successor to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, said
executive pay has ballooned beyond all reason and threatens public
support for free-market institutions.</TE>
<TE>   McDonough is not the first financial leader to criticize executive
pay--Greenspan and Goldman Sachs Chairman Henry M. Paulson Jr. made
somewhat similar comments this year. But by linking the issue to
Sept. 11 and framing it in moral terms, rather than as simply a
business decision, McDonough may have raised the stakes in the debate
over who runs U.S. corporations for whose benefit.</TE>

<TE>   FCC Begins Reviewing Media-Ownership Rules</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission kicked off a comprehensive
review of the government's long-standing media-ownership rules, with
a majority of commissioners signaling that they support relaxing or
consolidating at least some of the decades-old restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the current rules prohibit companies' owning
TV stations and newspapers in the same market, prevent TV station
owners from reaching more than 35% of the national audience and limit
the ownership of local radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   The step by the FCC was largely a formality.</TE>

<TE>   Mortgage Foreclosure Rate at 30-Year High</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of homeowners who fell behind on their mortgage
payments in the second quarter surged to the highest level in at
least 30 years, as more Americans lost their jobs and home prices
continued to rise sharply, a mortgage banking group said.</TE>
<TE>   The surge could signal that an increasing number of buyers have
paid more for their homes than they can afford, analysts said. The
misuse of home equity loans and the increase of no-money-down loan
programs also may have contributed to the increase in defaults,
economists said.</TE>
<TE>   From April through June, the percentage of loans on which
foreclosures were started rose to 0.40%, up from 0.37% the previous
quarter, according to Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America figures. That
is the highest level since the organization started tracking mortgage
defaults in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia Withholds Severance From Rigas</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia Communications Corp. won't make $4.2 million in payments
to John J. Rigas under a severance agreement reached when the cable
TV systems company founder and former chief executive stepped down in
May, according to a person who was briefed on the situation.</TE>
<TE>   No payments had been made under the agreement, said the person,
who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. The company has been
operating under bankruptcy protection since June.</TE>
<TE>   The reversal comes as WorldCom Inc. weighs rescinding the
severance of former CEO Bernard J. Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia agreed to a three-year package for Rigas in May, two
months after the company disclosed that it had guaranteed $3.1
billion in loans to partnerships controlled by his family. Since
then, Adelphia, with $20 billion in debt, has filed for bankruptcy
protection and filed a racketeering suit against the Rigases.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Criminal Probe of Martha Stewart Urged</TE>
<TE>   House leaders asked the Justice Department to launch a criminal
probe of Martha Stewart, saying she may have misled investigators
about her sale of a biotech stock.</TE>
<TE>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been investigating
whether Stewart, chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., relied on inside information when she sold nearly 4,000 shares
of ImClone Systems Inc. a day before the pharmaceutical company
disclosed that its cancer drug, Erbitux, had been rejected by the
Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) said Stewart's
phone records and other information obtained by investigators
indicate she may have given the committee false details about the
Dec. 27 stock transaction, which netted her $229,522.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has not been charged with a crime and has said she did not
engage in any illegal activity.</TE>

<TE>   Judge OKs Liquidation Plan for First Alliance</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge approved a liquidation plan for First Alliance
Corp., putting the finishing touches on a settlement that will yield
at least $75 million to borrowers and their lawyers who contended
that the Irvine home-equity lender routinely cheated its customers.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement includes $20 million from First Alliance founder
Brian Chisick and his wife, Sarah, with the rest coming from the
assets of the company. After a $15-million payment to attorneys, the
18,000 borrowers will receive checks totaling at least $60 million.
That's an average of $3,300 each, though individual payments will
vary widely.</TE>
<TE>   First Alliance, which never admitted wrongdoing, filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection in early 2000.</TE>

<TE>   Intel Unveils Details of Chip for Laptops</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to stay relevant in a world of evolving technology, Intel
Corp. unveiled details of a chip it will introduce next year designed
just for laptops, the only bright spot in an otherwise grim computer
market.</TE>
<TE>   Called Banias, the chip is Intel's costly attempt to keep up with
a new era of computing in which consumers will be less reliant on
their desktops, the firm's traditional stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   Intel envisions consumers using a panoply of devices designed to
be always on, portable and wireless.</TE>

<TE>   AOL Earnings to Fall Short of Forecasts</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. warned that the outlook for its America
Online unit is bleaker than it appeared just two months ago, blaming
a lingering Internet advertising slump that still is eroding revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based media giant stressed that the parent company's
overall projected revenue and cash-flow figures for 2002 have not
changed. But it said the Dulles, Va.-based Internet unit would earn
less than it estimated in July.</TE>

<HD>Lines Are Drawn in Debate on U.S. Tariffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cynthia Soriano knows the value of a dollar, which is why she shops
at a big discount chain where she can pick up a pair of imported
shoes for her 6-year-old daughter for $13.99. She doesn't know that
$2 or $3 of that bargain-basement price supports a tariff system that
critics say falls hardest on poor U.S. consumers and on developing
countries that produce labor-intensive goods.</LD>
<LD>   Those tariffs, designed to protect U.S. jobs by making imports
more expensive, are the focus of efforts to influence the Bush
administration's position on global trade.</LD>
<LD>   Pressures on the administration to make changes are coming from
several fronts. Recent studies question whether the tariffs save
American jobs. Transformations in the U.S. economy have made many
industries more dependent on imports and more unhappy with added
costs from tariffs. Developing countries are becoming more critical
of the U.S. for preaching open borders while maintaining steep
barriers to protect domestic industries.</LD>
<TE>   On the other side, some U.S. business interests, including some
shoe companies, say tariffs are needed to keep their industries from
being eliminated by foreign competition, raising the risk that
Americans will lose the capability to make important products.</TE>
<TE>   These arguments will influence the Bush administration as it
develops its position in the next year or two during trade talks
involving hundreds of countries.</TE>
<TE>   Three decades of trade liberalization have lowered the average
U.S. tariff to 1.6%. But the highest fees, ranging from 10% to 48%,
are found on inexpensive consumer goods such as clothing, shoes and
small household items whose production is concentrated in lower-wage
countries. Those tariffs add up to about $20 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   Critics argue that tariffs have failed miserably in their original
purpose: to protect U.S. jobs by making imports more expensive. The
U.S. footwear industry, for example, has nearly vanished, with
imports claiming 95% of the market. In 1968, U.S. footwear makers
operated 1,200 domestic plants employing 250,000 people. Today, there
are fewer than 40 companies employing 28,000 people, mostly in
specialty items such as work boots.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case where policy was stuck in one era and the world
has moved on without anyone really paying attention," said Edward
Gresser, a trade expert at the Washington-based Progressive Policy
Institute, who recently released a report on the subject. "Our tariff
system was operating in a way that no one would want it to and it was
getting huge amounts of money out of poor people while not protecting
jobs."</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. tariff system may be about to become unstuck. This
year, the American Apparel and Footwear Assn., whose members once
represented the most vocal supporters of tariffs, split with other
parts of the business community and called for an end to global
tariffs in apparel and footwear.</TE>
<TE>   "All my members have had to become importers to survive," said
Fawn Evenson, vice president of global business and services for the
Washington-based association. "They've shut down all their plants.
They see tariffs as a tax on them."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also faces growing pressure from advocates such as Oxfam
International, which accuse the industrialized countries of preaching
free trade while keeping tariffs high on industries, such as
textiles, where cheap labor makes poor countries more competitive. In
response to those complaints, the Bush administration agreed to
consider eliminating such barriers on apparel and textiles in the
latest round of global trade talks, which began in November and are
scheduled to end in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   This is far from a done deal, however, because these tariffs are
backed by politically influential supporters. They are led by the
American Textile Manufacturers Institute, the lobbying arm for the
large domestic textile mills, and the Rubber and Plastic Footwear
Manufacturers Assn., which represents New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc.,
one of the few remaining domestic makers of athletic shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Any U.S. trade pact containing a tariff reduction would have to be
approved by Congress, where Southern textile makers have successfully
fought off attempts to weaken tariffs. "They can negotiate all they
want, but Congress has to approve it," said Charles Bremer, vice
president of international trade for the textile manufacturers'
group.</TE>
<TE>   There is more than just jobs at stake, argues New Balance Chairman
and Chief Executive James Davis, whose Boston-based firm operates
five factories in Massachusetts and Maine. He said the U.S. is at
risk of becoming dangerously dependent on foreign goods unless it
does a better job of supporting domestic manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "What if we went to war with China?" he asked. "Where would we get
our shoes?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis insists he is not anti-trade. New Balance employs 2,400
people worldwide, imports three-quarters of its shoes and sells its
products in 120 countries. But he said he is committed to keeping
some of his production close to home, where he can provide
good-paying jobs and better serve retail customers. To increase
factory efficiency, Davis divides his production workers into teams
and asks them to develop creative ways to narrow their costs so they
can compete with imports.</TE>
<TE>   "They know how many minutes it takes to make that shoe," Davis
said, "and how much it is costing us to make that same shoe abroad.
They know what their goal is."</TE>
<TE>   But Davis argues that no matter how many pennies they squeeze out
of the production process, New Balance's $12-an-hour U.S. workers
can't compete without tariff protection against workers in Asia
making $2 a day. "We're able to produce units at a relatively low
rate, but it's still not at the rate it comes from China," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the tariff system say that it is the middlemen and
not consumers who will benefit from removal of import charges. Robert
Scott, chief economist with the Washington-based independent Economic
Policy Institute, said his research has shown that "90% of the
changes in import costs were absorbed by distributors and retailers"
and there was "very little pass-through" to consumers. Since the
costs are spread throughout the consuming public, he believes tariffs
are worth keeping even if they save only a small number of jobs.
"Tariffs have proven to be relatively insignificant barriers to
imports, but nonetheless I think they have retained some jobs," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Chu, manager of the U.S. office for Doublestar Group, one
of China's leading shoemakers and a supplier to Payless ShoeSource
Inc., Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., agrees that the biggest
beneficiaries of tariff elimination are likely to be large retailers.
But he said such a move also would ease the pressure on shoemakers,
which face stiff pressure to keep wholesale prices low so importers
can avoid the highest tariffs. For example, the tariff on imported
fabric shoes selling for less than $3 a pair is a whopping 48%, but
an additional 90 cents per pair is tacked on for shoes between $3 and
$6.</TE>
<TE>   "We must stay below $3, otherwise the cost is too high for them to
sell," said Chu, who was displaying his wares at the recent China
Name Brand Products Show at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   Gresser, of the Progressive Policy Institute, says the savings
from the elimination of tariffs would be passed on to consumers
because the retail sector in the U.S. is so competitive. If that
occurred, the biggest beneficiaries would be the poor who bear a
disproportionate share of the burden of tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   Tariffs are highest on goods that represent a significant share of
purchases for a working-class family, such as apparel and shoes. For
example, a single-parent family earning an average $25,095 spends
$411 a year on shoes while a two-parent family making $66,913 shells
out $480 on shoes, based on the Progressive Policy Institute's study
of tariffs. . That means the single-parent family is spending a much
higher percentage of its salary on shoes and shoe tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, tariffs tend to be higher on the cheaper products
purchased by lower-income consumers, Gresser said. Imported shoes
made of leather carry a tariff rate of 10% while rubberized canvas
shoes have a tariff rate of 48%. Silver-handled forks have no tariff,
but cheap stainless steel forks carry 15% tariffs. Women's silk
underwear is taxed at a rate of 2.4% while polyester underwear
carries a 16.2% tariff.</TE>
<TE>   But Gresser said few people know they are paying these hidden
taxes because they are rolled into the final cost of the goods.</TE>
<TE>   "The poor people who would benefit [from tariff removal] don't
know this policy exists," he said. "There's nothing that tells them
you're paying $10 on those shoes and $2.50 is going to the
government."</TE>
<TE>   At the Lincoln Mini Mall, a warren of cramped stalls offering
discount clothing and shoes in Los Angeles' Lincoln Heights, Soriano
brightens at the idea that an overhaul of the tariff system might
translate into a few more dollars in her pocketbook.</TE>
<TE>   "It does add up," said the 27-year-old mother, whose family relies
on the income of her husband, Jose, a mechanic. "I'm the type of
person who if I see a penny, I'm going to pick it up."</TE>

<HD>World Is at Fingertips of Blind Worker With Abacus</HD>
<DH>An ancient tool for counting provides invaluable assistance
to an indomitable e-banker</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS COBBS</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>His fingers move with the swift, delicate purpose of a pianist
coaxing a sensuous melody from a Beethoven concerto.</LD>
<LD>   John Allen is lost in his numbers.</LD>
<LD>   Seated at a desk in a sprawling open area with dozens of cubicles,
the blind e-banker is effectively alone, listening to his talking
computer through earphones and talking back with his hands.</LD>
<TE>   As the curled fingers of one hand punch in digits on a keyboard,
the other hand manipulates beads on an abacus, an ancient counting
device used for addition, subtraction and toting up the price of
goods.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who once showed computer magnate Bill Gates how a
vision-impaired individual works a PC via talking software, is
equally proficient on a counting tool with a 2,000-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Practical antiquity and modern technology intersect in the
fingertips of this SunTrust Banks worker who answers customers'
online queries about the $9.75 ice cream purchase they forgot to
enter in the checkbook.</TE>
<TE>   As he hears a customer's online inquiry, he enters the person's
account number, transaction a- mount and phone number on the abacus.</TE>
<TE>   "I use it as a note pad," he says. "I can enter numbers two or
three times faster on the abacus than on the keypad."</TE>
<TE>   The beads on his well-used abacus are starting to show wear, the
finish flaking off bit by bit. So sensitive are his fingertips that
when he feels a particle of paint peeling, "it's like touching the
thorn on a rosebush."</TE>
<TE>   Allen, 32, handles about 10 e-mails per hour at the SunTrust
operations building, a high-security facility set among a cluster of
warehouses. A former telephone order taker at a Pizza Hut, he has
worked his way up to the online banking job through several years of
technology and independent-living classes in Miami and Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to take more advanced computer programming classes but
says he will never abandon his abacus, a trusty companion since he
lost his vision to retinitis pigmentosa at the age of 10 in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   As a substitute for paper and pen, the abacus enables him to add,
multiply, divide and use fractions. He takes an abacus nearly
everywhere, jotting down a phone number to be entered into his PC, or
keeping a running total on his spending at the grocery bill.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never off more than a penny at the grocery store, even if I
spend $100," says Allen, a divorced father of one. His reliance on
the abacus is unusual because few vision-impaired individuals are
trained to use the low-tech tool anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Since he is unable to see, Allen must rely completely on the
dexterity and precision of his fingertips to manipulate numbers. And
there's a similar surgical precision in his manner and the layout of
his desk, says Karen Tharpe, who supervises Allen and a staff of 30
online staffers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's so aware of his surroundings," she says. "If you move his
keyboard a half-inch, he knows. He always sets his water bottle in
the exact same place, to the right and above his keyboard. There's no
paper on his desk, and he never uses a trash can."</TE>
<TE>   Quiet and focused, Allen sits down and gets to work immediately
each morning. He rarely speaks unless someone else speaks first, yet
he talks at length when addressed and often jokes about his
blindness.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 4 years old, I was playing tag with a little girl in
our neighborhood in Miami," he says. "It was getting dark, and I ran
into a fence while chasing the girl. That was the first time I knew
something was wrong with my eyes. But I guess it was better to run
into the fence than the sticker bush next to it."</TE>
<TE>   The staff at SunTrust wasn't sure just what to expect when Allen
was hired last December, but he has quickly learned about banking.
Like other online workers, he's required to process 10 e-mails per
hour with 95% quality for grammar, spelling accuracy and
completeness, says Tharpe.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still a little slower than the rest, but he's improving
monthly. It takes time to get up to par. He's sweet and even-keeled,
and he never shows frustration. He's an inspiration to all of us."</TE>
<TE>   In the event of any frustration, Allen has a way to take out his
feelings. A former black belt in judo, Allen is working out nightly
trying to get back into shape. After being struck by a car a decade
ago, he grew lax and gained weight but now hopes to return to judo
competition next year. Even in the rough and tumble of judo, he uses
his hands to guide his movements.</TE>
<TE>   With his fingertips gripping the lapels of an opponent's workout
suit, Allen can sense the lean of the body, the direction of the
feet, even the angle of the toes, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers, movements, things visible and invisible, Allen measures
the world through the tips of his fingers.</TE>

<HD>Really, the Dan Band's a Man Band</HD>
<DH>They're just 'regular guys' singing 'girl' songs in L.A.'s
hottest nightclub act</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is not your ordinary story about girl power, because our leading
lady, well, he's a man--a country boy who was raised in a rural town
in upstate New York among tough football players, farmers and
roughnecks and who happens to sing "I Am Woman" for a living.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, Dan Finnerty, 32, has been singing girl songs for most
of his life; the only difference is that now the self-deprecating
leader of the Dan Band--Los Angeles' hottest nightclub act--is
getting paid for it and receiving national attention for his
hilarious renditions of girlie greats, such as Cher's "Gypsies,
Tramps and Thieves," LaBelle's "Lady Marmalade" and "There's a New
Girl in Town," otherwise known as the theme to the late '70s sitcom
"Alice."</LD>
<LD>   "In my high school, if you weren't a farmer or a football player,
you got your [butt] kicked," says Finnerty, sipping iced tea in his
"work uniform," a blue car mechanic's shirt and a backward baseball
cap. "So I was the guy who always got his kicked. My sister is four
years older than me, and we only had one record player. So while my
friends who had brothers were listening to Led Zeppelin, I was
singing 'Mickey' and 'Gloria' with my sister and her friends.</LD>
<TE>   "Now I'm all grown up and singing girl songs for a living. Up in
New York, they're probably waiting with pitchforks to kick my [butt]
again."</TE>
<TE>   For four years, the Dan Band--made up of Finnerty; two nerdy,
deadpan backup singers; and a tight rock band--has sold out many of
Los Angeles' hippest spots: the Viper Room, the Knitting Factory and
Largo. Last year the band sold out Fez, a New York hot spot, for a
four-month run, and this summer the group moved to the Highlands, a
large and swanky venue at the Hollywood and Highlands complex, after
being recruited from club 1650.</TE>
<TE>   And now the group, which evolved from a drunken karaoke moment,
may be on its way to developing a TV sitcom based on its act.</TE>
<TE>   Finnerty is, of course, the center attraction and the only one who
addresses the audience--a protocol he insists on offstage as well.
But Darryl Armbruster and Gene Reed, the backup boys in geeky suits
and eyeglasses, add plenty of spice to the show with their hip-hop
and Broadway dance moves and facial expressions, especially when
rapping to Salt-N-Pepa's sexy "Shoop."</TE>
<TE>   The group of "regular guys" doesn't just sing and play music. They
bump and grind in synchronicity, like Britney Spears and Janet
Jackson with their entourages of dancers. Finnerty also glides around
and splashes water on his head a la Jennifer Beals in "Flashdance"
and stages a perfect "Ice Castles" triple axel and fall--while never
losing his manliness.</TE>
<TE>   "I've pretty much exhausted every bad '80s move that I have, so
we've now started working with the choreographer for [the videos of]
'No Scrubs' and 'Genie in a Bottle,' " Finnerty says. "She comes up
with all this hard stuff, and we basically break it down to what
three fat white guys can do."</TE>
<TE>   In between songs--and sometimes during the songs--Finnerty curses
like a sailor and teases the crowd, using his impeccable comedic
timing to ad-lib throughout the night. By the time he reaches his
favorite medley, a combination of Erykah Badu's humorous "Tyrone" and
Mary J. Blige's inspirational "No More Drama," the crowd is holding
candles, swaying and laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "They are so different from anything that is normal," says Cheryl
Gundred, 55, who was handpicked from the audience by Finnerty one
night to join him onstage, where she played up her inner diva and
received Finnerty's official sweat rag. (Other keepers of his stage
towel include Meg Ryan.) "It's so funny to see a bunch of guys who
are not drag queens singing these chick songs. It's so refreshing and
just what this town needs. Dan is so sexy."</TE>
<TE>   The band's celebrity following, including Jennifer Aniston, Brad
Pitt, Laura Dern, Ellen DeGeneres, Mark McGrath, Pam Anderson and Ben
Stiller, have followed them from club to club partly because Jillian
Barberie, of Fox's "Good Day Live," is a huge fan and mentions them
often on her show. But Finnerty's favorite celebrity visits are from
the original singers of his songs--like the time Alanis Morissette
ran onstage to startle him during his rendition of "You Oughta Know"
and when Helen Reddy praised him for his take on her girl-power
anthem.</TE>
<TE>   There was also the time Gloria Steinem walked in while Finnerty
was singing "Gloria." ("You can't pray for that!" he said.) Recently
the Dan Band was invited to be front-row guests of "American Idol"
during one of the show's last episodes.</TE>
<TE>   "I love them so much that whenever someone visits from out of
town, I take them to see them," Barberie said. "It's such a different
night out. It's a better side of Hollywood to show out-of-towners
because they get to see celebrities and see a show that's original.
You just don't know what to expect from them or who you're going to
see in the audience."</TE>
<TE>   All five shows so far at the Highlands, where the band performs
every other Friday, have been sold out.</TE>
<TE>   "This has really worked for us," said club owner and actor Nick
Colachis, 43, who likes to sing along to Charlene's "Never Been to
Me" and the Abba medley that brings the house down. "These guys are
very talented. Dan can really sing, and his band is very polished.
These are not guys fooling around like they're in college. I think
we're going to lose them. Somebody is going to discover them."</TE>
<TE>   Somebody already has. Warner Bros. studios signed a development
deal with Finnerty and "Charlie's Angels" director McG last month to
create a 30-minute sitcom based on the band for the current pilot
season, according to Finnerty's agent, John Ferriter, senior vice
president of the William Morris Agency. A Warner Bros. studios
spokeswoman confirmed the deal.</TE>
<TE>   All this from a night of karaoke, says Finnerty, who is in a
perpetual state of disbelief over the trajectory of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be a star," he said. "That would just be
annoying. I don't want people watching me eat. I just want to keep
singing girl songs and spread my message of girl power to the world."</TE>
<TE>   Who is this girlie-guy, anyway?</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood circles, he is best known as the husband of actress
Kathy Najimy, to whom he has been married for 6 1/2 years. But
Finnerty is also an actor who has made guest appearances on several
television shows ("Ellen," "Veronica's Closet") and who had small
roles in such movies as "The Wedding Planner" and the upcoming "Lost
Souls" and "Old School," in which he plays a wedding singer. The Dan
Band is featured on "The Wedding Planner" soundtrack and will be
included in the soundtrack for "Old School."</TE>
<TE>   Four days after graduating from Emerson College in Boston in 1992,
he was cast in the "Hair" revival tour in Europe, which he did for a
year, and later was hired for "Stomp." While in Toronto for "Stomp,"
Finnerty took the microphone at a karaoke bar, choosing "I Am Woman"
as his tune. He rocked the house and never thought of it again until
he was in Los Angeles, where he has lived for five years.</TE>
<TE>   "My friend was in a band, and she needed someone to open for her
and do three or four songs," Finnerty said. "I couldn't think of what
to sing. So I thought, 'I like that "I Am Woman" song; I'm going to
sing that.' I don't know. It just spoke to me."</TE>
<TE>   After the show, a talent booker for the Opium Den approached
Finnerty about expanding his four-song womanly repertoire to create
an eight-song show. Finnerty was stunned: "I was like, 'Dude, I was
just kidding.' "</TE>
<TE>   And he's been laughing all over Los Angeles ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, it's like the whole 'Stomp' thing for me," Finnerty
said. "I was so impressed with that show until they cast me. Then I
lost respect for them. You know what my real dream is? Performing
live at a women's prison. But I'm just going to keep singing my girl
songs and see what this turns into. Why quit now?"</TE>

<HD>Are We Seeing the Death of the Dress?</HD>
<DH>Fashion* A growing preference by women and designers for
separates is pushing the former staple off the retail racks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET WEBB PRESSLER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent tour of a Hecht's department store, company President
Frank Guzzetta stopped at a display of casual dresses.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a category we can't make small enough, fast enough," he
said. Sales of daytime dresses have declined eight seasons in a row,
he said, because "women just don't wear dresses anymore."</LD>
<LD>   Research shows that dress sales have been declining steadily for
years. In 1997, $8.9 billion of dresses were sold in the United
States, according to market research firm NPDFashionworld in Port
Washington, N.Y. Last year, dress sales totaled just $5.4 billion.</LD>
<TE>   But that raises a classic retail chicken-or-egg question: Are we,
as shoppers, dictating the death of dresses because we don't want
them anymore? Or is it a change wrought by the growing pressures on
Seventh Avenue, the nerve center of the fashion industry?</TE>
<TE>   Guzzetta said one of his executives who frequently wears dresses
to work blames designers and retailers. "She thinks they're just not
making good dresses," he said. But Guzzetta is skeptical, sensing the
kind of Bigger Issue that vexes retailers, one involving cultural
trends, fashion, shopping habits and women's tastes.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Guzzetta and the dress-wearing executive are right--sort
of. There aren't as many good dresses being made now, but that's
because no one is buying them, according to fashion industry
executives.</TE>
<TE>   There are simply more obstacles involved in making dresses than a
simple suit, skirt or blouse. Creating a style that fits as many body
types as possible, shoulder to knee, is difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Separates are much easier to design, and therefore more
economical; they also more easily fit a wider audience, leaving fewer
leftovers at season's end.</TE>
<TE>   Financial pressures on Seventh Avenue have been growing as big
retailers are demanding financial concessions from manufacturers in
case their clothes don't sell well.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, many retailers are hiring their own design staff
and expanding private-label fashions. Designers have responded by
trying to make their operations more efficient, and that's a good
reason to ditch the dress for easier-to-design mix-and-match pieces.</TE>
<TE>   But if women wanted to wear dresses three days a week,
manufacturers would make it happen. The real story behind the
neglected work dress is probably more about shoppers' lifestyles and
changing tastes than changing economics.</TE>
<TE>   It may be harder to make dresses and make money, but even Bud
Konheim, chief executive of New York design house Nicole Miller,
concedes that shoppers drive the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't dictate this stuff; the marketplace dictates what
they're going to wear," he said. "There's no daytime dress business
out there."</TE>
<TE>   A dress may look pulled together, but it also looks dressy, while
workplace fashion standards have been loosening up. Once women
started feeling more comfortable wearing separates, they also began
discovering that tops and bottoms have other advantages. Plenty of
shoppers buy separates because they can get more wear out of them: A
skirt can look casual with a T-shirt or sophisticated with a tailored
jacket.</TE>
<TE>   After wearing a dress, though, a woman might feel she needs to put
it away for a few weeks before she can wear it again. That ends up
being three or four appearances a season, and after a couple of
years, it's either out of style or she's sick of seeing it in her
closet.</TE>
<TE>   Konheim said women miss the feeling of being "dressed," and that's
showing up in the evening-dress business, which is booming. Women may
believe it's OK to buy something they'll wear only a few times if
it's for a special occasion.</TE>

<HD>Ups and Downs of Jousting</HD>
<DH>A Virginia town laments waning of the old sport, which is
more popular in nearby Maryland</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IAN SHAPIRA</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antonio Hernandez picked up his first lance just last week, but no
one at the annual jousting tournament in the genteel Virginia town of
Hume could tell he was a rookie. In practice heats, he was looking
deft at the sport, charging 100 yards on his faithful steed and
spearing shower-curtain-ring-size loops dangling from wood posts.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez, a.k.a. the Riverton Knight of Paddington farm, quickly
became a crowd favorite at the Leeds Ruritan Club jousting tournament
last week. But his success was overshadowed by grumblings among the
locals that their beloved pastime, which dates to the early 1900s in
this swath of Virginia, is fading into history.</LD>
<LD>   Newcomers to this territory in Fauquier County, where homes are
perched on breezy hills overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains, are not
so keen on the whole jousting bit, tournament organizers lament.</LD>
<TE>   "This was a sleepy, agricultural community. Now it's becoming like
McLean--and nobody ever wants that," said David Schumacher, the
retired Channel 7 news anchor and former NBC and CBS correspondent
who emcees the tournament every year. "Some of the new people out
here just aren't nice. They act superior to the locals, and they
don't want to try out the joust or even come to the event."</TE>
<TE>   It's a different story across the Potomac River, where jousting
has been the official sport of Maryland since 1962, and where the
state seal depicts Lord Baltimore as a knight in armor mounted on his
charger. The state plays host to more than 50 jousts each year--some
of which, like those at the Maryland Renaissance Festival in
Crownsville, feature lance-to-lance combat.</TE>
<TE>   "Dangerous? Very much so. Our guys are not choreographed, either.
They really try to hit, and sometimes they get hurt. I've seen guys
with frightening bruises and hematomas," said Mary Ann Jung, royal
court director of the festival, which continues until Oct. 20. "What
we're doing out here takes a lot of training and hard work."</TE>
<TE>   Only a few spots in Virginia offer jousting tournaments or clubs.
On Oct. 12, the National Jousting Assn., based in Mount Solon, Va.,
will have its annual championship. More than 100 riders are expected
to compete.</TE>
<TE>   Jousting originated in Europe in the 10th century as petty but
bloody warfare among knights vying for fame and women. Somewhere down
the centuries, the combatants decided to tone down the violence,
opting to spear rings instead of one another. Previously,
ring-spearing was a training exercise for would-be jousters.</TE>
<TE>   The sport surfaced in this country in the mid-1800s. One of the
first tournaments was in the Shenandoah Valley, according to the
National Jousting Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Hume would like to see a revival of jousting, which
they believe would revive their community as well. In its heyday, the
annual event merited a big barbecue dinner: roast beef cooked for six
hours, black beans, 400 ears of corn picked the night before, and so
much iced tea it had to be served out of trash cans.</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't we used to play bingo?" Rhonda Stribling asked as she
watched Saturday's joust from a lawn chair with friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah. They even had dancing," Sally Shoemaker said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with attendance down to a few dozen, all that's needed are a
single grill for hot dogs and hamburgers, a couple of coolers with
drinks and a plate of brownies.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as five years ago, 30 to 40 jousters could be counted
on, said Alex Green, the town's 85-year-old patriarch and a jousting
aficionado. On Saturday, their number had dwindled to 13, as the
older generation has retired and hung up its chain mail.</TE>
<TE>   Seriously. Riders used to trot out in full medieval attire: chain
mail and sashes, with emblems draped over their horses.</TE>
<TE>   Modern-day Sir Lancelots prefer the J. Crew look: jeans and polo
shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Hume and its neighboring towns of Markham and Orlean, home to
well-known media types and retired CIA operatives, have largely
avoided the development sweeping through central and southern
Fauquier County, places closer to Washington. But small signs along
the byways next to "country-style" developments signal the
transformation in progress: J.D. &amp; Associates Roofing and Sheet
Metal, Maryland Pools, Middleburg Kitchen &amp; Bath.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such changes, however, the area remains mostly rural, with
numerous cattle and horse farms, even a 60-acre apple and peach
orchard.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea this whole horse thing is so big out here," said
Anna Hofer, 38, a nurse who moved to Virginia from Phoenix about a
year ago and came to check out the tournament. "I've taken a few
horse-riding lessons with my children, but jousting is kind of out of
our league."</TE>

<TE>   "Ten Thousand Children"</TE>
<TE>   by Anne L. Fox and Eva Abraham-Podietz</TE>
<TE>   This book has sad but true stories of children who escaped from
the Holocaust. When Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, he ordered
every German to be mean to Jews. He made laws that German and Jewish
children could not go to school together. The Nazi party, what
Hitler's supporters were called, formed groups to educate German
children about how great they thought Hitler was.</TE>
<TE>   Hitler had men and women go to concentration camps. A
concentration camp is like a prison. That was when they thought of
the Kindertransport--a train that took Jewish children to England.
This book is about children who escaped on the Kindertransport.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's Sunday in Los Angeles, one chapter in a seven-part weeklong
story, a mini narrative with millions of variations. At the New
Millennium Sports Beauty and Barber Salon on Crenshaw and 43rd, Jay
Byrd, a barber who takes only half a day off every week, says that
Sunday is time to be with the family and get ready to "knock down the
trees on Monday." Father Greg Boyle, who lives and works in East Los
Angeles, sees the day as a time to "engage at a full level," in
communal and spiritual outlets. At the farmers market on Main Street
in Santa Monica, Gary Gordon arrives early on Sundays to grab a table
and wait for his "community of co-thinkers" to join him, ready to
test his values through conversation and debate. And in North
Hollywood at the Wat Thai Buddhist Temple, Pamela Susslin brings
food, candles and incense as a "merit" offering to the monks who live
and practice there.</LD>
<LD>   What we do on Sunday in Los Angeles, a day that for most of us is
our own, reveals what we regard as precious and where we go in search
of it. A city that detractors say lacks a soul is surprisingly full
of people who have crafted a sense of community, spiritual depth and
creative engagement from the expanse of this weekend day.</LD>
<TE>   Writers, historians and even psychoanalysts have explored and
dissected the richness of Sunday, sensitive to its historical,
emotional and symbolic meaning. F. Scott Fitzgerald looked out at the
Pacific Ocean with its "colorless ... sluggish sunset" and observed
dismally that Sunday in Los Angeles was not a day but a "gap between
two other days." Historian Alexis McCrossen writes that Americans
have debated the purpose of Sunday since the country was founded.
Would Sunday be a holy day or a holiday? And Sandor Ferenczi, a
psychoanalyst and contemporary of Sigmund Freud, theorized that a
"Sunday neurosis" afflicted his patients with depression and other
guilt symptoms brought on by a loosening of the psychic repression
necessary to make it through the work week.</TE>
<TE>   Divining the meaning of this day, it seems, can be an exercise in
self-or even cultural revelation. And pausing to observe Los Angeles
on a Sunday, it's possible to see and sense the city's essence. On
Sunday the soul has time to think and feel for itself, giving earthly
form to our transcendent yearnings. It's the day when the city
becomes manageable, recognizable and human.</TE>
<TE>   Father Boyle believes that a critical difference exists in how
Eastsiders and Westsiders approach Sundays. In contrast to their more
affluent and status-obsessed counterparts on the Westside, people in
East L.A. don't "fall into the trap" of defining themselves by what
they do during the week, he says. "There are a lot of doctors and
lawyers who don't know who they are when the weekend comes. In East
L.A., Sunday is a joyous thing, the opposite of alienation, because
we define ourselves by what we do on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   At Dolores Mission Church, the church parish just across the 1st
Street Bridge that separates East L.A. from downtown, Sunday is a day
of communal purpose. The locals call the Dolores Mission area the
"flatlands," set apart by the hills of Boyle Heights and the
freeways, a kind of sacred space and axis around which people orient
their lives. Every Sunday, dozens of parishioners gather in the
parking lot of the church for a venta de comida--a food sale run by
local women that benefits the neighborhood school, homeless shelter
or a needy family.</TE>
<TE>   The small church is full for the early morning Mass. Teenage
lovers hold hands in the back of the room while the rest of the
congregation sings together, the words of the hymns projected
slightly off kilter on a blank white wall. Three ceiling fans are
silent and still, but poised for the afternoon heat. Here the Sunday
finest includes suits and ties but also the casual attire of a Dodger
shirt and a Deportivo Cruz Azul soccer jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Margarita Amador, who works for the Los Angeles Housing Authority,
prepares food outside while waiting for the service to end. "Sunday
is a day to meet new people and gather information for the week
ahead," she says, summarizing her desire to integrate work and life
in a community she says she will never leave.</TE>
<TE>   Sundays at Dolores Mission reflect what biblical scholar John
Dominic Crossan says was the heart of the original Jesus
movement--"shared egalitarianism of spiritual [healing] and material
[eating] resources." At the church each week, that profound story is
reenacted in its own intimate way through the sharing of food and the
offering of emotional support, the symbols of Christian mystery
observed in a small parking lot next to a humble church.</TE>
<TE>   Teresa Mejia, who waits for her daughter to exit Sunday school,
says simply, "It's food that brings us together. We don't have
therapy or counseling. If I feel bad, one of my friends here will
comfort me."</TE>
<TE>   The search for community goes on in other parts of the city too.
On a lazy Sunday in Leimert Park, singer-songwriter Sean Miller
relaxes on the steps of Doboy's Dozens Coffee House, a meeting place
for African American musicians, filmmakers and aspiring actors. A
jazz saxophonist and a guitar player riff together inside, preparing
for that evening's open jam session.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's Sundays have become more "scattered" since he quit his
job in the complaints department of a large insurance company and
"stepped out on faith" to pursue his art. Now, rather than feeling
the "Sunday dread" of returning to a job he hated, he owns more of
his time--finishing his album, seeing his family and celebrating the
positive energy of his church. "There is so much negativity in the
world it's hard to deal with that by yourself. So on Sunday, I try to
be around happy people because it's hard to be sad when you're around
happy people."</TE>
<TE>   Down the street at the New Millennium, where a basketball
backboard, rim and net are attached above the door and the barbers
wear Laker jerseys, Al Brooks sits for his weekly trim. It's the
beginning of a day that will include watching sports and spending the
evening at his mother's house in Compton, where his large family of
siblings gathers each Sunday for gumbo. "Sunday is as close to a
holiday as any day, and a time to check in on my brothers and
sisters," he says, beneath the sounds of a tennis match being
broadcast on four televisions in the corners of the large room.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Louis Gates Jr., chair of the Department of African American
Studies at Harvard University, believes that history's long hand
reaches right into the most personal details of a community's daily
life. Gates, on a business trip to Los Angeles, had spent a morning
at church with comedian and actor Chris Tucker, an experience that
reminded him of the church of his youth, filled with "glorious" music
and a powerfully delivered sermon. "It was an emotional catharsis, it
really rocked," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Gates also recalls childhood Sundays with his family eating
"Mama's" sumptuous meals and watching football. The roots of the
tradition are deep, he adds. Under the thumb of their overseers "six
days a week, slaves had to experience their culture on Sunday, the
only time they could do so above ground."</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Genovese, historian and author of one of the most
influential studies of slavery, concurs, concluding that Sunday was a
day that slaves made their own, carving out an autonomous space away
from the overseer by creating a community of song, dance and prayer
as part of a "single offering the beauty of which pays homage to
God."</TE>
<TE>   "Even though people don't think about it too much," says Gates,
"by getting with their families, we're tending a
200-year-old-ritual."</TE>
<TE>   Sanong Choochuen, a 40-year-old Buddhist monk from Thailand, is up
by 5 a.m. on Sunday to chant and meditate. But like the other 20
monks who rise with him at the Wat Thai Temple in North Hollywood, he
sees Sunday as a time with no special significance. It's one more day
in what he calls the "wheel of life," another opportunity, he says,
to move toward enlightenment with each breath. So here, Sunday, like
every day, is a day of potential transformation, of transcending this
mundane world through awareness and meditation. "If you are bored on
Sunday, it is your mind that is boring, not the world," Choochuen
says, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   There is a feeling of serenity inside the temple, a largely empty
room with a 40-foot-high vaulted ceiling and a plush red carpet for
kneeling and meditation. At one end of the room are several gold and
green statues of Buddha, surrounded by food, flowers and others gifts
brought by morning worshipers. Choochuen laughs and points to the
green Buddha. "If you want a new job or a new wife, put a carton of
eggs in front of that one." It's his sly way of acknowledging that
practitioners have altered a few of the Buddha's teachings over the
centuries.</TE>
<TE>   The notion that every moment is a time for awareness and
reflection appeals to Pamela Susslin, an actress who comes on Sundays
for the rituals that help her cope with the stresses of urban life. A
"learning Buddhist" who has recently started paying closer attention
to its spiritual disciplines, she offers food, candles and incense to
the monks in honor of her recently deceased mother, a devout
Buddhist.</TE>
<TE>   She prefers a religion that is not the equivalent of a spiritual
filling station where, she observes, "people atone on Sunday and then
go out and do things that hurt others during the week. Coming here on
Sunday connects me with the fact that we are flawed as human beings
but there are lessons to learn in life and a path by which to learn
them." She believes her mother has reached enlightenment, the final
goal of Buddhist practice, and will not have to be reborn again into
this world to work through the karmic cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the temple, Studio City resident and comedy writer Phil
Stellar has brought his son Chet, whom he adopted from Thailand, to
experience his culture and to partake of the Thai food fair that is
held here each weekend. Stellar, who is Jewish, says that he is now
more of a "Jewist" or "Buddish," an idiosyncratic commingling of the
two religions. He wants his son to appreciate both traditions. "What
can I say? Buddhism is a gentle and loving religion with great food,"
he says, ordering Thai chicken from one of the food stalls that line
the entrance to the temple.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Sunday farmers market in Santa Monica, Gary Gordon is
joined by other members of what he jocularly refers to as the
"Algonquin West" group. Some 30 or 40 regulars will make their way to
the table over the next few hours. "Sometimes we talk politics,
sometimes it's trivia," observes John Gabree, an Ocean Park writer
and former bookstore owner. Debates have covered "educational
vouchers and the virtues of Krispy Kreme doughnuts," he adds. Joshua
Avedon, an Internet consultant who grew up in Venice, regards the
Main Street market as a "commons" for the Westside, part organic
general store and part community water cooler. "We're not corporate
types and a lot of us work at home," Gordon adds. "Sunday is our
happy hour without the booze."</TE>
<TE>   The group has been meeting since the marketplace started more than
10 years ago, an indication that if we build space for community,
people will come.</TE>
<TE>   We create our city on Sundays. It is not the city of spectacle and
sensation, and it's far more than the violent crescendo of Sunday NFL
football. It's a place where, through millions of intimate gestures,
communal gatherings and quiet musings, a restorative spirit that is
banished during the tumult of the workweek is brought back home.</TE>
<TE>   The potential for community is here--in those places where we can
create our little platoons of friendship and connection--but they
have to be looked for and created. Across the city, Sunday is a
reflection of what we want our city to be: a beginning, a faint
glimpse of life's full potential--and, looking into a new week, a
belief in that which has not yet begun.</TE>

<LD>Two points about Tim Rutten's story ("McPaper at 20: A Brief List of
Successes," Sept. 6) on USA Today's 20th anniversary:</LD>
<LD>   In identifying the paper's audience as "laptop-toting business
travelers," Rutten has failed to check the coffee shops and
convenience stores in his own neighborhood. Smart circulation
directors know--and should worry-- that a great unrecognized story of
USA Today's success is in the ordinary, nontraveling
folks--especially young people, women of all ages, and just-moved
families--who prefer it to the local daily.</LD>
<LD>   UC Berkeley Dean Orville Schell, whom Rutten quotes, doesn't get
it, either. "With USA Today, it's all something you can get somewhere
else," he complains.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe, but the sweet spot is hidden in that very sentence. Most
citizens don't have time to scout dozens of papers and magazines,
watch endless cable TV and comb the Web to become informed. But if
anybody makes news in any forum (and across a wide range of topics),
USA Today will have at least a note on it.</TE>
<TE>   At 20, USA Today is still evolving, and that's a good thing. It's
interesting that some journalists still don't see the way it works.</TE>

<TE>   As a working journalist who, among other things, has been held at
gunpoint by the IRA, picked my way through the rubble and carnage of
devastating earthquakes and witnessed the horrific aftermath of some
of the world's worst air crashes, I can assure Rutten there are many
things a lot more depressing than finding USA Today on your door
handle.</TE>
<TE>   There have been times when I and many other working journalists
would have been overjoyed to have a hotel room, let alone one with
that day's newspaper delivered to you while you slept.</TE>

<LD>I am a writer who has looked long and hard at the connection between
childhood discipline and criminal behavior. The idea that paddling is
useful always comes back when the pendulum swings too far toward
permissiveness ("Not the Paddle, but Maybe a Little Dose of Fear,"
Sandy Banks column, Sept. 8).</LD>
<LD>   This is much like alternating between gluttony and anorexia.
Although it controls behavior in the short run, paddling, or fear of
it, is utterly ineffective at building the self-control that leads
youngsters to become responsible, nonviolent adults. Swatting a child
teaches him that violence achieves control.</LD>
<LD>   Parents need to be clear with their children about what kind of
talk and behavior are acceptable. They need to teach their children
healthy ways of interacting among siblings and schoolmates. Paddling
is no more the answer than is lack of discipline. If you talk to
convicted inmates, you will often find that, as children, they were
subjected to these extremes. They offer us a look at how such
youngsters turn out as adults.</LD>

<LD>David Ulin may be incapable of seeing the big themes in Los Angeles
literature ("Anthology, Like L.A., Goes Its Own Way," Sept. 2), but
that doesn't mean they are not there.</LD>
<LD>   The major influence of prewar writing was the California bohemian
tradition. This tradition was a humanist one, and also a politically
progressive one, begun by the likes of Mark Twain and Jack London,
and ultimately including people such as Carey McWilliams, Louis
Adamic, John Steinbeck and Upton Sinclair. Los Angeles gave them a
lot to write about.</LD>
<LD>   During and after World War II, the tradition became,
appropriately, much more apocalyptical, as reflected by people like
Aldous Huxley, Nathanael West, Malcolm Lowry (West and Lowry had
their feet in both camps), Thomas Mann, Charles Bukowski and Oscar
Zeta Acosta.</LD>
<TE>   Ulin didn't see the patterns because he is incapable of feeling
the passions engendered by both sources of Los Angeles literature.</TE>

<HD>'Loser' Phone Number Mean to the Extreme</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The idea of a woman giving out a bogus "loser's" phone number instead
of her own is an old one ("Hey, Loser, Got a Message for You," Sept.
9). Some years ago I met an attractive young woman and asked for her
number. She gleefully gave it to me. I phoned the very next day, only
to hear a taped recording: "Thank you for calling the Los Angeles
Zoo.... " My only solace was a good laugh because, even though the
joke was on me, it was truly funny.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, Jeff Goldblatt's "loser's" phone number is lean on
humor and mean to the extreme.</LD>

<HD>How Should Parents Handle Kids' Feud? Don't</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The summer has passed, the kids are back in class, their lunch table
cliques have reconvened. The girls seem to have patched up their
differences, yet their mothers still don't speak.</LD>
<LD>   They passed one another awkwardly, as they walked their daughters
to class last week; once friendly women eager to chat, now looking
away so eyes don't meet.</LD>
<LD>   Their daughters cannot help but notice. It was their feud that
turned their moms against each other. But they've moved on ... and
their mothers haven't.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't believe they're still not speaking," one child proclaims,
rolling her eyes to convey her disdain. "It's, like, over. Stop being
mad. Don't they have anything else to do?"</TE>
<TE>   And I wonder, in this tableau of parent and child, who is teaching
what to whom?</TE>
<TE>   It is one of those tales from the world of girls that can stand
for anything you want it to, depending upon where you sit and through
what prism you view it.</TE>
<TE>   Two fifth-grade girls feud. One says she's fed up with being
bossed, accuses her friend of manipulation. "I've decided I don't
want to be your friend anymore," she tells the girl she views as her
tormentor.</TE>
<TE>   The other girls in their group have grievances too, so when they
are called on to take a stand, they gang up to denounce her too. "We
can't be friends," they say. "You're out of the group."</TE>
<TE>   Their pronouncement reduces her to tears. She is stunned, hurt,
then repentant. Later, she sobs out the tale to her parents, who
handle things the way grown-ups do. They comfort their daughter, then
call the mothers. They suggest a meeting after school, where the
girls can work out their differences.</TE>
<TE>   But these differences will not be worked out; not then, not under
the watchful eyes of mothers and a teacher who's there to mediate.
While the mothers wait outside, the teacher encourages the girls to
talk and is stunned by their ferocity. The accusers sound so petty
and cruel, dredging up offenses from second grade. The outcast begs
pitifully for a reprieve. Everyone cries, but no one budges.</TE>
<TE>   The mothers peer through a window into the classroom, ears pressed
to the door to hear. They argue among themselves over whose child is
at fault, whose is hurting the most. Each sees different victims and
villains and interprets the story to fit their beliefs:</TE>
<TE>   It's a symbol of the corrosive power of cliques, an example of
"relational aggression," the new buzzword for the social jousting
among girls that occurs on schoolyards every day. Or it's simply the
outcome of a clumsy attempt by a group of young girls to stand up for
themselves and define social boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   And the mothers? They are protective and caring, trying to enforce
standards of civility. Or they are over-invested in their daughters'
lives, trying vainly to keep childhood trouble-free.</TE>
<TE>   It's a story I'm close enough to relay with some familiarity.
Still I can't say who's right or wrong, only that the anecdote fits
neatly into our new preoccupation with girl bullying--the label we
now apply to the heartbreaking rituals that have always shaped girls'
sociability.</TE>
<TE>   But is kicking someone out of the friendship club the same as
stealing lunch money or making the fat kid the butt of jokes? Is it
always meanness that prompts girls to lash out, or sometimes
confusion and insecurity? We teach them these days to stand up for
themselves, to own their feelings and stake their claims. And we have
to accept that sometimes they'll stumble as they try to find a space
between being a doormat and being a bully.</TE>
<TE>   I stumbled when I was in fifth grade, and I might not have
recovered if my mom had gotten in the way. A friend and I were on the
outs with a girl from our circle. There was nothing she had done
wrong. We were as uncool as she, but we longed for a taste of
exclusivity.</TE>
<TE>   So we shaded our eyes when she came near and promised not to say
her name. (Karen became Nerak--her name backward--whenever we had to
speak of her.) We ignored her in class, on the playground, at lunch.
She got the message and began staying away. But by sixth grade, we'd
grown beyond the rancor. Over time, Nerak and I became close
friends--a friendship that's lasted to this day.</TE>
<TE>   Our mothers were friends and remained close through it all. They
probably never even knew of our troubles. If they did, they never got
involved.</TE>
<TE>   If you were ever a girl, this might sound familiar. Part of
growing up--then and now--is learning the steps to the friendship
dance. We can counsel our daughters through it, but there's not much
we can do to smooth the path.</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of us have enough trouble managing grown-up friendships.
Like our children's, they have uncertain contours and shifting
landscapes. Sometimes we hurt our friends, sometimes they hurt us.</TE>
<TE>   It's a rite of passage, a growing pain, and unless someone
threatens bodily harm, parents often do best staying out of the way.</TE>

<LD>Capping a week of opening ceremonies for the Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels, two benefits held on the same night raised $2.2 million
for its educational, cultural and community outreach programs.</LD>
<LD>   The black-tie $1,000-per-person "Celebration of Dedication" on the
cathedral's Grand Plaza drew 1,300 guests, with the less formal $125
ticket "La Luz" bash--held later on another area of the
plaza--drawing 400.</LD>
<LD>   Attended by cathedral artists, donors, area clergy and business
leaders, the Sept. 7 galas celebrated religious diversity in a
multimedia program "A Journey to Light."</LD>
<TE>   "We have sought in this first week to include every facet of the
community--young and old, wealthy and poor, Catholics and those of
other faith traditions," Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, archbishop of Los
Angeles, told guests as they sat under the stars. "Tonight is the
culmination of that effort."</TE>
<TE>   Jew and Catholic, Buddhist and Protestant appeared onstage in the
presentation that also featured performances by the USC Thornton
Symphony, the Los Angeles Children's Choir and inspirational readings
by Anjelica Huston, Rita Moreno, Edward James Olmos, Keith David and
Peter MacNicol.</TE>
<TE>   With the east facade of the 11-story cathedral serving as a
gigantic movie-screen, projected religious images--brilliantly hued
stained-glass windows, Gothic spires, gold-leaf angels--provided the
backdrop as the actors spoke of the new structure built alongside the
Hollywood Freeway on the northern slope of Bunker Hill.</TE>
<TE>   When Huston addressed the audience, she described the cathedral's
contemporary bronze statue of the Virgin Mary (which was cast by
Huston's husband, sculptor Robert Graham ) as "a daughter of Los
Angeles, a woman of the 21st century ... with the hands of a working
woman, capable hands, strong hands--ready to help, ready to lift us
up."</TE>
<TE>   Moreno added: "She is Caucasian, Asian, African, Latina, Native
American."</TE>
<TE>   Arriving guests, serenaded by mariachis and greeted with hearty
handshakes from Mahony, were invited to spend the two-hour gala
reception touring the adobe-colored cathedral designed by the
Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jose Rafael Moneo.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, reverently, the attendees made their way through the
bronze doors and along the limestone floors into the nave, where,
accompanied by the musical roar of the 6,000-plus pipe organ, they
viewed its Turkish marble altar table, free-standing crucifix,
tapestries and granite-clad baptismal font. "The minute we walked in,
my wife, Sandi, started to cry," said L.A. Dodger announcer Vin
Scully. "I guess that sums it up."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, guests dined on filet of beef and angel food cake at
plexiglass tables lighted from beneath and spread with two layers of
cloth--the color of the underskirt keyed to the walls of the
cathedral, the overlay to its translucent Spanish alabaster windows.</TE>
<TE>   Seated with Huston, Graham said the fact that there has been some
controversy about his nontraditional statue of Mary--situated above
the stunning 5-ton bronze doors that he also cast--was something over
which he had no control. "I try not to think about it too much," he
said. "My response to the whole thing is how wonderful the cathedral
is, how the people are responding daily to the totality of it--to be
a part of that is much more important than anything I have done."</TE>
<TE>   Also among guests were gala co-chairs Helen and William M. Close,
Patricia and Roy E. Disney, Gretchen and Bruce Willison and Phyllis
and J. Michael Hennigan. Others attending included Moneo, John Nava,
cathedral pastor Msgr. Kevin Kostelnik, Kirk Douglas, Monica and
James Hahn, Gayle and Ed Roski, Gretchen and Michael Wayne, Robert
Maguire, Margie and Tom Romano, Susan and Timothy Strader, Carmen and
Jose Lladro, Amanda and Anthony Mansour, Kathryn and Steve Sample,
Annette and Peter O'Malley, Noelle and Edward Aloe, Shannan and Eric
Binder and Constance and John Gavin.</TE>

<TE>   Golden West</TE>
<TE>   Its famous Jacques Lipchitz fountain disguised as a sprawling
saloon, Music Center Plaza was turned into a town from the Gold Rush
for Los Angeles Opera's opening night gala--traditionally the launch
of L.A.'s social season. After a performance of Puccini's "The Girl
of the Golden West" on Sept. 4 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 620
guests--including production stars Placido Domingo and Catherine
Malfitano--and orchestra director Simone Young--swept along a gold
carpet to the party scene where dancers sashayed to a fiddler and the
landscape included a general store, covered wagon and stagecoach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the sheriff," proclaimed Frank Baxter, co-chairperson with
his wife, Kathrine, of the gala netting $600,000 for opera company
operations. "The opera blew me away; it had everything--drama,
conflict, deception and a happy ending."</TE>
<TE>   After a preseason period marked by the cancellation of the
$3-million production of "War and Peace" because of a lack of ready
cash, the opera is banking on its own happy ending, replacing the
Prokofiev piece with Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk.
(Verdi's "Nabucco" opened Sunday and runs in repertory with "The Girl
of the Golden West" through Sept. 28.) Also included on the season
roster: Offenbach's "Tales of Hoffmann", Rossini's "The Barber of
Seville" and Mozart's "Don Giovanni."</TE>
<TE>   "Our problems will only be temporary--not long-term," Domingo, the
opera's artistic director, told patrons, who included "Golden West"
production underwriters Milan and Milena Panic, and Marc Stern, opera
president and chief executive officer. "The season is going to be
great because we have wonderful supporters, and L.A. loves opera,"
Stern said. "Just watch us."</TE>
<TE>   As guests buzzed about the production--"Interesting that an
Italian would write an opera about the California Gold Rush,"
observed Emmy Award-winning TV actress Doris Roberts--they sat at
tables covered with crushed bronze silk and dined on grilled beef
tenderloin, glazed short ribs, stone fruit cobbler and bourbon pecan
pie.</TE>
<TE>   Also enjoying the scene was Nikita Doroshina, who came to Los
Angeles from Moscow 10 years ago. She wasn't surprised to see an
operatic spaghetti western, she said. "Even in Russia, the American
cowboy is a big stereotype. That's what I thought when I came
here--that you would all be cowboys."</TE>
<TE>   On the guest list: Marta Domingo, opera chairman Leonard Green
with Kara Fox, Bernie and Lennie Greenberg, Carol and Warner Henry,
Alice and Joe Coulombe, Amanda and Nicholas Stonnington, Mary Hayley
with Selim Zilkha, Mira Sorvino and her dad, Paul, Cybill Shepherd,
Hector Elizondo, Garry Marshall and Tara Colburn.</TE>

<TE>   Patron Salute</TE>
<TE>   With excerpts from the cabaret production "Forbidden Hollywood" as
entertainment, major donors to the Orange County Performing Arts
Center were honored Monday at its annual Firebird Dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Staged under the dramatic Firebird sculpture in Segerstrom Hall,
the gala for about 150 guests included a formal dinner and thank-yous
to the supporters who have given the center $25,000 or more in the
past year.</TE>
<TE>   Among those receiving kudos from center President Jerry Mandel and
board chairman Paul Folino were Nora Hester, Robert and Teresa
Nichols, Mike and Jan Salta, Sue and James Swenson, Karen and Steven
Tsubota and Heidi and Nick Shahrestany.</TE>

<LD>It was the first day of school. Bobby waved to his mom, who stood on
the porch. " 'Bye, Mom!" he said.</LD>
<LD>   "Goodbye, Bobby," she said. "Have a good day!"</LD>
<LD>   Bobby walked alone. He was scared. He had never walked alone to
school.</LD>
<TE>   Then suddenly, something on the ground wiggled. It was a snake! He
jumped back. The snake did not move. Bobby got closer.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, it was only a stick! He picked up the stick and carried it.</TE>
<TE>   He walked along. Behind a fence came a growling noise. It had to
be a lion! Bobby held up the stick to protect himself.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, it was only a friendly shaggy dog!</TE>
<TE>   Carefully he turned the corner, wondering what was waiting for
him. Leaves in a tree rustled. Something big and black was staring
out from the branches. It was a panther!</TE>
<TE>   Bobby shook his stick.</TE>
<TE>   "Meow," the panther said.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, it was only a black cat!</TE>
<TE>   A roaring dinosaur waited for him around the next corner. Bobby
was sure of it. He could hear it grinding its teeth. He got his stick
ready.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, it was only a garbage truck mashing the trash.</TE>
<TE>   The men waved to Bobby, and Bobby waved back.</TE>
<TE>   Looking down the street, Bobby could see a giant waiting for him.
It was dressed in orange armor and carried a shield. Now Bobby was
really scared. He got his stick ready for action.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, it was only the crossing-guard lady!</TE>
<TE>   She smiled. "Hello, there! Ready for the first day of school?"</TE>
<TE>   Bobby nodded his head. Across the street was school. Lots of
children were already there. They waved and called to him,</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Bobby! Hurry up! Let's play!"</TE>
<TE>   Wow, he'd made it! He was safe. Bobby threw away his stick. He
wouldn't need it again.</TE>

Robison says she does too, just like the boy in the story. This story

<DH>Personnel changes in the booth bring a new look and sound
to the broadcasts of NFL, NBA games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman, Daryl H. Miller, Mark Sachs, Scott Sandell and
Jonathan Taylor</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the National Football League's season kicked off on Thursday,
Sept. 5--the first time in 50 years it started on a weekday--it
brought big changes to the broadcast booth.</LD>
<LD>   Pat Summerall has retired from the Fox roster, and his partner,
John Madden, now joins Al Michaels on ABC's "Monday Night Football."
To replace Summerall and Madden, Fox has tabbed Joe Buck, their lead
baseball play-by-play man, to sit alongside Troy Aikman and Cris
Collinsworth and do the same for football.</LD>
<LD>   The league's broadcast partners, however, remain the same: CBS
will broadcast AFC games on Sunday afternoons, while Fox has the NFC.
ESPN has its regular Sunday-night telecast, and ABC returns for its
33rd year of "Monday Night Football."</LD>
<TE>   Noteworthy matchups include the New England Patriots at Miami
Dolphins (CBS, Oct. 6);St. Louis Rams at San Francisco 49ers (Fox,
Oct. 6); Oakland Raiders at Denver Broncos (ABC, Nov. 11); Chicago
Bears at Green Bay Packers (Fox, Dec. 1); Washington Redskins at
Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day (Fox, Nov. 28); and Cowboys at
Redskins (Fox, Dec. 29).</TE>
<TE>   Even more change is in store for pro basketball fans, who will
find their favorite sport on ESPN, ABC and TNT this year after 12
years on NBC. Under a new six-year, $4.6-billion TV package, ABC will
air as many as 15 regular-season NBA games on Sundays, plus five
early-round playoff games and the NBA Finals. ESPN and ESPN2 will
carry 75 regular-season games, with doubleheaders on Fridays and
single games on Wednesdays. ESPN will air as many as 17 early-round
playoff games. TNT gets 52 regular-season games, almost all on
Thursday nights, and 45 early-round playoff games. ESPN and TNT will
telecast both the East and West conference finals, and the All-Star
game moves to TNT. The regular season begins Oct. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Golf's major tournaments are done for the year, but one
significant international event remains: the Ryder Cup. Postponed
last year because of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the
every-other-year tournament will be played at the Belfry in Sutton
Coldfield, England. Tiger Woods, David Duval and Phil Mickelson head
the American team, and Sergio Garcia, Padraig Harrington and Colin
Montgomerie lead the Europeans. USA Networks will telecast the first
day's play, Sept. 27, and NBC will carry the rest on Sept. 28 and 29.</TE>
<TE>   In college football, Bowl Championship Series officials have
tweaked the ranking system, eliminating margin of victory as a
factor. But will this lead to fewer one-sided games? CBS, ABC, NBC,
ESPN and Fox Sports Net will be the major broadcasters. Among the
games to watch are: Michigan at Notre Dame (NBC, Sept. 14); Florida
at Tennessee (CBS, Sept. 21); LSU at Arkansas (CBS, Nov. 29); and
Army versus Navy (CBS, Dec. 7).</TE>
<TE>   Major league baseball's postseason starts with the division
playoff series on Oct. 1. The coverage will be split between cable's
ABC Family and Fox. After that, the games are all Fox's, starting
Oct. 8, with the American and National League Championship Series,
and climaxing with the World Series, scheduled to open in the home
park of the American League champion Oct. 19.</TE>

<LD>By all appearances, the broadcast television networks finally got the
message that audiences are hungry for original programming even
during summer months. What's more, they've learned to do it with
relatively inexpensive programming.</LD>
<LD>   Just look at the success that reality/competition shows "American
Idol" and "Dog Eat Dog" both enjoyed.</LD>
<LD>   But summer fun is over, and now it's time for the networks to
return to what they do best, or at least what they're more accustomed
to doing: unleashing a fall stampede of 35 new comedies and dramas,
episodics and anthologies, shows focusing on cops and kids, doctors
and degenerates. A few new shows have dribbled out already, with the
stream picking up this week in advance of TV's official premiere week
the seven days following the Emmy Awards on Sept. 22.</LD>
<TE>   It's difficult for even the most dedicated TV watcher to keep
track of it all--made no easier this year by the presence of two
medical shows set in San Francisco airing opposite one another, one
show offering a welcome to Tucson and another sending out greetings
to Miami, and three new cop series set on the gritty streets of Los
Angeles--but maybe we can help.</TE>
<TE>   What follows are capsule summaries of the new series offerings
from ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, UPN and the WB. You'll find some pertinent
information and some extras too. Let the watching begin.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday</TE>
<TE>   Title: "Oliver Beene"</TE>
<TE>   Network: Fox</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 7:30 p.m. Premieres in early 2003, after fall sports
season ends</TE>
<TE>   Key cast: Grant Rosenmeyer, Grant Shaud ("Murphy Brown"), Wendy
Makkena ("Sister Act"), Andrew Lawrence</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: Executive producer Steven Levitan ("Just Shoot
Me")</TE>
<TE>   The gist: The Cold War fears of 1962 are nothing compared to the
everyday dangers of being 11-year-old Oliver Beene (Rosenmeyer). He
copes with on-edge parents (Shaud, Makkena), a tuned-out brother
(Lawrence) and daily humiliations of being class clown at school.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Baby boomers</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "The Wonder Years"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: ABC's "Wonderful World of Disney," CBS' "60
Minutes"</TE>
<TE>   What it has: A nostalgic pull for anyone who grew up with the
Kennedys, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the early Johnny Carson years</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: To lose the attitude</TE>
<TE>   Title: "American Dreams"</TE>
<TE>   Network: NBC</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 8 p.m. Premieres Sept. 29</TE>
<TE>   Key cast: Brittany Snow ("Guiding Light"), Gail O'Grady ("NYPD
Blue"), Tom Verica ("Providence")</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: Dick Clark is executive producer, along with
creator Jonathan Prince ("Blossom")</TE>
<TE>   The gist: In 1960s Philadelphia, a 15-year-old girl gets to dance
on "American Bandstand," but the turbulent times spur her and the
rest of the family to think about more important dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Families</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "The Wonder Years"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: Its family-hour foes include "The Wonderful
World of Disney" and "The Simpsons."</TE>
<TE>   What it has: Exhilarating tunes and choice "Bandstand" clips</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: Drama with the oomph to match the soundtrack. For a
nostalgic family drama, this is one forgettable family.</TE>
<TE>   Title: "Bram and Alice"</TE>
<TE>   Network: CBS</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 8:30 p.m. Premieres Oct. 6</TE>
<TE>   Key cast: Alfred Molina ("Chocolat," upcoming "Frida"), Traylor
Howard ("Two Guys and a Girl")</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: Created by writer-producers Joe Keenan and
Christopher Lloyd ("Frasier").</TE>
<TE>   The gist: A washed-up, womanizing barfly of a novelist and a
struggling writer, who is among his many fans, discover they are
father and daughter. She moves into his Manhattan flat, launching an
awkward new chapter in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Connoisseurs of witty sitcoms</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "Cheers" meets "Frasier," with a flawed hero who is a
cross between Sam Malone and Frasier Crane.</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: "The Simpsons"</TE>
<TE>   What it has: Snappy writing, a hammy delight in Molina as the
incorrigible schemer, a co-star who holds her own in Howard and a
droll supporting cast</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: Some have questioned the creepy father-daughter
reunion in the pilot. Otherwise, not much, if that first episode is
any guide.</TE>
<TE>   Title: "The Grubbs"</TE>
<TE>   Network: Fox</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 9:30 p.m. Premieres Nov. 3</TE>
<TE>   Key cast: Michael Cera, Randy Quaid ("Kingpin," "Independence
Day"), Carol Kane ("Taxi," "Man on the Moon"), Lori Rom</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: Writer-producers Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey
Ventimilia ("That '70s Show")</TE>
<TE>   The gist: Geeky 14-year-old Mitch Grubb (Cera) lives in a houseful
of slackers--including a dad who fell off a forklift on purpose to
collect disability--but when his alluring, motivated teacher (Rom)
moves in next door, his so-called life will never be the same.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Teenagers</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "Growing Pains" meets "Married ... With Children."</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: "Alias"</TE>
<TE>   What it has: Crude, cheesy humor, and a lead-in from the classier
"Malcolm in the Middle."</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: Better jokes. On the other hand, crude and cheesy
have drawn big ratings before.</TE>
<TE>   Title: Boomtown</TE>
<TE>   Network: NBC</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 10 p.m. Premieres Sept. 29</TE>
<TE>   Key Cast: Neal McDonough ("Band of Brothers"), Donnie Wahlberg
("Band of Brothers"), Mykelti Williamson ("Forrest Gump"), Nina
Garbiras ("The Street"), Jason Gedrick ("The Last Don," "Murder One")</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: Executive producers Graham Yost ("Speed") and
Jon Avnet ("Fried Green Tomatoes")</TE>
<TE>   The gist: Like many shows before it, this one focuses on crime and
crime fighting in Los Angeles. Like no show before it, "Boomtown"
explores the crime from various viewpoints: an ambitious D.A.
(McDonough), a conflicted cop (Wahlberg), a newspaper journalist
(Garbiras) and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Adults of perhaps a more sophisticated bent</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "Law &amp; Order" if "Rashomon"-era Akira Kurosawa were
supervising</TE>
<TE>   What it has: A strong cast of familiar and fresh faces, and a
fresh idea in the most tired of TV genres</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: To maintain the quality of the pilot, and to resist
the temptation to delve too much into soap opera devices</TE>
<TE>   Monday</TE>
<TE>   Title: "Everwood"</TE>
<TE>   Network: WB</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 9 p.m. Premieres Sept. 16</TE>
<TE>   Key cast: Treat Williams ("Good Advice," "The Late Shift"),
Gregory Smith ("The Patriot")</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: Creator/executive producer Greg Berlanti
("Dawson's Creek")</TE>
<TE>   The gist: Suddenly widowed, a renowned New York City neurosurgeon
moves with his two kids to the snowy hamlet of Everwood, Colo., to
start afresh amid the colorful locals. He finds that the hardest
wound to heal is a rift with his 15-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Families, especially those with teens</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "7th Heaven" meets "Northern Exposure"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: "Everybody Loves Raymond"</TE>
<TE>   What it has: Wholesome appeal, a charismatic young talent in Smith
and a reliable pro in Williams</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: Less sugar. A bit of the twinkly-eyed school bus
driver who speaks only in pearls of wisdom, for instance, goes a long
way.</TE>
<TE>   Title: "Girls Club"</TE>
<TE>   Network: Fox</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 9 p.m. Premieres Oct. 21</TE>
<TE>   Key cast: Gretchen Mol ("Rounders," "Sweet and Lowdown"), Kathleen
Robertson ("Beverly Hills, 90210"), Chyler Leigh</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: Writer-producer David E. Kelley ("Ally McBeal")</TE>
<TE>   The gist: Three best friends from law school start their careers
in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: "Ally"-watchers</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "Ally McBeal," of course, but perhaps also some of
"First Years"</TE>
<TE>   Main competition: CBS' "Everybody Loves Raymond," UPN's similarly
named "Girlfriends." Oh, and memories of "Ally," whose old time slot
"Girls Club" now occupies.</TE>
<TE>   What it has: Unknown; this show was unavailable for preview.</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: See above</TE>
<TE>   Title: "Half and Half"</TE>
<TE>   Network: UPN</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 9:30 p.m. Premieres Sept. 23</TE>
<TE>   Key cast: Rachel True, Essence Atkins, Telma Hopkins ("Family
Matters"), Valarie Pettiford ("One Life to Live")</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: Executive producer Yvette Lee Bowser ("A
Different World," "For Your Love")</TE>
<TE>   The gist: Long-separated half-sisters who have a father in common
but little else must coexist in the same apartment building,
separated only by a floor/ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: 16-and-up fans of sibling-rivalry, family-clash
high jinks</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "Too Close for Comfort," or the "Cosby" family on the
rocks</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: Fox's "Girls Club"</TE>
<TE>   What it has: Smart writing, sassy cast</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: A direction beyond the usual TV bickering</TE>
<TE>   Title: "Still Standing"</TE>
<TE>   Network: CBS</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 9:30 p.m. Premieres Sept. 30</TE>
<TE>   Key cast: Mark Addy ("The Full Monty"), Jami Gertz ("Twister")</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: Writer/executive producers Diane Burroughs and
Joey Gutierrez ("The Drew Carey Show," "Murphy Brown")</TE>
<TE>   The gist: A blue-collar Chicago couple who started out as high
school sweethearts try to raise three kids while keeping their
marriage intact. He sells toilets; she wears the pants around the
house.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Families</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "Everybody Loves Raymond"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: "Monday Night Football" (depending on the time
zone and length of the game), and perhaps "Girls Club" if David E.
Kelley has another hit on his hands.</TE>
<TE>   What it has: Compelling chemistry and rat-a-tat timing between its
stars, plus an ideal lead-in from "Raymond"</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: A more convincing Chicago accent from British-born
Addy. But if the writing remains at the pilot's quality, viewers will
surely give the chap a break.</TE>
<TE>   Title: "CSI: Miami"</TE>
<TE>   Network: CBS</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 10 p.m. Premieres Sept. 23</TE>

"The Corner")</TE>

the original's creator, Anthony E. Zuiker, and Jerry Bruckheimer</TE>
<TE>   The gist: The precision of the original "CSI" in swinging Miami</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: "CSI's" multitudes of viewers</TE>
<TE>   Most like: It doesn't take a forensics expert to figure that one
out.</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: It's in a cream-puff time slot against NBC's
"Crossing Jordan." But perhaps the original "CSI" is the real
competition.</TE>
<TE>   What it has: Same winning formula in another party-hearty city. A
launch in the last episode of last year's "CSI."</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: Viewers with an evening to devote to another "CSI"</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday</TE>
<TE>   Title: "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter"</TE>

<TE>   Behind the camera: "Frasier's" Kelsey Grammer is executive

<TE>   The gist: A young woman and her new husband move into her parents'
house so he can go to cooking school, and inevitable conflicts arise
between him and his gruff father-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Young or not-so-young adults who haven't left the
nest, and the people who love them</TE>
<TE>   Most like: Postnuptial "Meet the Parents" and echoes of "All in
the Family"</TE>

predictable premise</TE>

<TE>   Behind the camera: Executive producers Emile Levisetti, Keith

Super(natural) P.I. His sixth sense can help him solve cases--or kill
him.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Other-side fanatics 18 and older</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "X-Files"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: CBS' "The Guardian," WB's "Smallville"</TE>

<TE>   Most like: Any TV comedy-variety show from the '50s onward,
particularly Fox's earlier "In Living Color"</TE>

<TE>   What it has: Cedric's characters in a "really big shew," with "The
Bernie Mac Show" as a lead-in</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: To keep the skits fresh and, if that fails, a
continuous engagement for the host in Vegas</TE>

<TE>   Target audience: Older teens, young adults, hip baby boomers</TE>
<TE>   Most like: "Smallville," of course, as well as "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" and the defunct "Dark Angel"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: NBC's "The West Wing," Fox's "Fastlane"</TE>
<TE>   What it has: Dark, moody visuals and a setup rife with meaty
psychological issues. And what a wardrobe.</TE>

Oracle and Huntress, and excuses to get Meyer out of her wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Title: "Fastlane"</TE>
<TE>   Network: Fox</TE>
<TE>   Time slot:  9 p.m. Premieres Sept. 18</TE>

MTV, Tiffani Thiessen ("Beverly Hills, 90210")</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: McG, stylish director of "Charlie's Angels"
(even his name is quick and cool)</TE>
<TE>   The gist: Two ultra-suave L.A. undercover cops take a fast and
furious ride on the edge in pursuit of justice, guided by a sultry
lieutenant who gives them access to "the candy store" of stolen
goods.</TE>

implausible ride</TE>

<TE>   Network: UPN</TE>
<TE>   Time slot: 9 p.m. Premieres Sept. 18</TE>
<TE>   Key cast: Forest Whitaker ("Panic Room," "The Crying Game") in the

The Next Generation"), executive-produced by Pen Densham, Mark Stern
and John Watson of Trilogy Entertainment ("The Outer Limits" 1995
series, "Poltergeist: The Legacy")</TE>
<TE>   The gist: Submitted for your approval: a 21st century update of
the concept Serling conceived for the original '59 series; edgy,
unsettling stories about strange things that happen to people and
communities, having more to do with human imperfection than anything
supernatural, although that plays a role too.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Sci-fi and mystery fans</TE>
<TE>   Most like: The two previous TV incarnations, naturally</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: Lots of it in what might be TV's toughest hour:
"The West Wing," "Fastlane," "Birds of Prey"</TE>
<TE>   What it has: A tremendous legacy, and a potential audience open to
stories of the unexplainable in this post-"X-Files" world</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: An easier time slot</TE>

<TE>   Behind the camera: Executive producer/writer Gary Tieche,
executive producer Marc Platt ("Legally Blonde")</TE>
<TE>   The gist: A San Francisco hospital's beleaguered medical staff,
split roughly between renegade rule-breakers and by-the-book
anal-retentives, has at it, leaving the patients to take cover</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: 16 and up</TE>
<TE>   Most like: The more sedate S.F.-set medical drama "Presidio Med"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: See above, plus "Law &amp; Order"</TE>
<TE>   What it has: A strong ensemble cast and that most venerable of
story-generating settings, a large urban hospital</TE>

Mummy")</TE>
<TE>   Behind the camera: Created by Lydia Woodward and John Wells, whose
joint work includes "ER" and "China Beach"</TE>
<TE>   The gist: The doctors of a San Francisco medical group battle the
impersonal, bottom-line-driven health care system that can terrify
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Adults</TE>
<TE>   Most like: The more frenetic S.F.-set medical drama "MDs," and
"Chicago Hope"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: NBC's "Law &amp; Order"</TE>
<TE>   What it has: Since it's not set in an emergency room, it can move
at a slower pace than "ER," allowing more time to get to know the
patients and to build empathy for their dilemmas. And the appealing
casting is a plus.</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: A shot of Adrenalin. Stat.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday</TE>

of Our Lives")</TE>

<TE>   Most like: If you still have to ask ...</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: ABC's "Dinotopia"</TE>
<TE>   What it has: A cool apartment that's more art museum than bachelor
pad. And Tim Curry has a grand old time as Mr. French, who here is

curiosity/nostalgia factor wears off</TE>

now.</TE>
<TE>   Target audience: Anyone who ever once uttered, "Tubular!"</TE>
<TE>   Most like: A combination "Wonder Years," with 20-20 foresight, and
"The Time Machine" ... not to mention ABC's "That Was Then"</TE>

wave songs</TE>

<TE>   Most like: "Twin Peaks," "X-Files"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: CBS' "CSI," NBC's "Will &amp; Grace"</TE>

<TE>   Most like: Aspiring to "Mary Tyler Moore," "WKRP in Cincinnati"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: "CSI"</TE>

<TE>   The gist: The FBI's missing persons squad, which is headed by

Order"/"CSI" tradition</TE>

<TE>   What it has: Swift pacing, a solid cast and a potent lead-in from
the original "CSI"</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: Cases, like the one on the pilot, with enough
twists to keep you guessing. And viewer fatigue with "ER" wouldn't
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Friday</TE>

Street" meets, heaven help us, "Touched by an Angel."</TE>

<TE>   Most like: "The X-Files" and CBS' short-lived "Now and Again"</TE>

face that will launch a thousand magazine articles</TE>
<TE>   What it needs: To simplify</TE>

<TE>   What it has: The "If I knew then what I know now" spin offers rich

"George Lopez"</TE>

<TE>   Target audience: Mature audiences, fans of realistic cop action</TE>
<TE>   Most like: Mann's "Heat"</TE>
<TE>   Major competition: NBC's "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit"</TE>

<HD>Bellagio: Lucky Find in the Lake Region</HD>
<DH>The scenic village on Lake Como has long been a playground
for the world's elite</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE S. LEVINE</AU>

<DL>BELLAGIO, Italy</DL>
<LD>Tell friends that you will be spending your vacation in Bellagio, and
they are likely to assume you're talking about the glitzy hotel on
the Las Vegas Strip, the one created by entrepreneur Steve Wynn.</LD>
<LD>   Wynn, former chairman of Mirage Resorts--now MGM Mirage--was
inspired by the northern Italian village of Bellagio in the building
of his grand hotel. Ironically, the town is less well known, even to
Italians, than its popular American namesake.</LD>
<LD>   No one arrives in the village--tucked onto a remote corner of the
shore overlooking Lake Como--by chance. And from the moment you
arrive, it's easy to understand the allure of the little town that
draws visitors from around the world and compels them to return.</LD>
<TE>   Your jaw drops at your first panoramic view of the majestic
Italian Alps, juxtaposed against the large expanse of blue water in
Europe's deepest lake. With an unspoiled grace and charm, the town of
Bellagio offers its guests a rare opportunity to experience a style
and pace of life that has remained unchanged for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1873, aristocrats, royalty, statesmen and stars of the
silver screen--such as Winston Churchill, King Farouk, the
Rothschilds, John F. Kennedy, Clark Gable and Al Pacino--have made
the Grand Hotel Villa Serbelloni their holiday home. The hotel still
serves a well-heeled but low-key clientele.</TE>
<TE>   For the past three years, my husband, Jerry, my teenage son Andrew
and I have spent our summer vacations at the Villa Serbelloni's
Residence l'Ulivo. Housed in an ochre-washed building with green
shutters, it is in the same private park as the main hotel. Each of
the 13 apartments offers the comforts of home on the grounds of the
only five-star hotel in Bellagio. We set up a household and live much
as the locals do.</TE>
<TE>   The apartments are furnished simply, but guests at the residence
enjoy the same amenities as those in the hotel--including use of the
two hotel restaurants, indoor and outdoor pools, tennis courts, spa,
gym and cardio-fitness center. The apartments share an inviting patio
that beckons guests to sit and read in the shade of an umbrella by
day or to watch the stars and the lights of the nearby towns of
Varenna, Tremezzo, Menaggio and Cadenabbia at night.</TE>
<TE>   We meet the same neighbors, who return each year from England,
Wales, Germany, Australia and the States. We have become friends,
sharing news of discoveries around town and exchanging e-mails during
the winter.</TE>
<TE>   A beautiful pool, with a large deck and an outdoor bar, is
positioned between the Grand Hotel and the lake's small, sandy
beachfront. We sit on chaises at the beach facing the lake for hours
and lose track of time. We glimpse the miniature towns nestled
comfortably into the green hillsides across the lake and find it hard
to stop thinking about the breathtaking natural beauty. We adjust to
the slow rhythms of the traghetti (ferries) as they traverse the
lake. We have the sense that we have finally found paradise.</TE>
<TE>   Our own newly acquired rituals remind us that we are, indeed, at
home in Bellagio. Each morning my husband and I take a walk down the
winding street steps away from the hotel grounds. The heart of town,
and its historic center, is called Il Borgo. It comprises two narrow
one-way streets that are accessible to cars, the Via Garibaldi going
south and the Via Piazza Mazzini going north. The rectangular piazza
has a shopping arcade that overlooks the port.</TE>
<TE>   Like the more daring natives of the town, we walk down the middle
of the road with seeming impunity. Sometimes frustrated drivers honk
their horns at us. Occasionally the controlled chaos of the street is
punctuated by a motorbike that tries to pass a parked truck
delivering Chiarella bottled water.</TE>
<TE>   The two roads are separated by a series of narrow pedestrian
alleys with steps, called montees. They run perpendicularly, linking
the top level of the town to the lower level at the lakefront. Red
geraniums and bougainvillea vines hang from window boxes and
balconies above the stairs. It's hard to miss the animated banter of
families or the fragrant aromas escaping from kitchen windows at
lunchtime.</TE>
<TE>   We take a different path each time we go up or down, pausing to
take pictures of the beautiful architecture.</TE>
<TE>   The largest of the stairways is the Salita Serbelloni. Busy shops,
restaurants and bars flank the wide stone stairs that the locals call
Il Fossato (the ditch). During medieval times, the ditch was used to
defend the town from enemies. Each step is made of small stones that
have lost their edge from water or wear. When you make the steep
climb from bottom to top, shop windows with colorful silk scarves and
handmade leather goods provide a convenient excuse to pause to catch
your breath.</TE>
<TE>   Each morning we stop for what is perhaps the world's best cup of
cappuccino at Pasticceria Sport on Piazza della Chiesa (Church
Square) and order a cream-filled doughnut. Long ago the bar was a
monastery. Now its bistro tables and chairs on the street provide a
perfect spot for people-watching.</TE>
<TE>   We continue down the street and stop along the way to purchase
provisions for lunch at the apartment. The Panificio Gandola has
freshly baked breads and rolls. We go there first because they sell
out quickly. The negozio di frutta (fruit store) has ripe tomatoes
that taste as good as they smell and succulent black plums that are
unlike any we have ever tasted. Then we go to the Alimentari
Gilardoni Michele grocery for some prosciutto and local cheese.</TE>
<TE>   For just a few dollars, we can savor the bounty of the region.
Multilingual shopkeepers from one family work in the same stores for
generations and have perfected the art of making tourists feel
comfortable. After a couple of days, they recognize us and ask how
our day is going--"Come va?" Would we like to sample the cheese that
is more morbido (soft) or try the special salame hanging in the
window?</TE>
<TE>   The simplicity of the day is pleasantly jarred by the reminder
that we are living within a resort enclave. My son and his friend
take advantage of the racquetball courts in the health club and play
tennis on the outdoor courts terraced into the hill above the
residence. In the heat of the late afternoon, the boys run down to
the pool to refresh themselves before dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Bellagio, sited some distance from major roads, is safe enough and
small enough--it has a resident population of 3,000--that young teens
can independently experience life "in town." They take walks to La
Punta, the point, to see where the lake splits into three branches.</TE>
<TE>   They watch the small fishing boats bringing in lavarello, the fish
that seems to be on every restaurant menu. They shop for little gifts
for their friends in the kitschy shops near the port.</TE>
<TE>   The stores attract a stream of visitors who arrive by boat to have
lunch and visit some of the tourist sites. On Tuesdays the boys
search for bargains at the once-a-week open-air market that seems to
be a favorite with Italians from surrounding towns.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner plans vary. One night we cook a simple meal of fresh pasta
with porcini mushroom sauce, all ingredients purchased at the nearby
mini-market. For a first course we have delicious insalata mista,
assorted greens and radicchio topped with olive oil that is a product
of local trees. For dessert we eat a few baci di Bellagio, sinful
butter cookies filled with chocolate, which we've bought from the
pastry shop up the hill. Another night, the boys bring in thin-crust
pizzas from Babayaga, a steakhouse and pizzeria just outside the
hotel gate. We order two  pizze margherite with cheese and tomato,
another with spinaci and another with salsiccia, sausage. Each comes
in a small box that we use as a disposable plate--no dishes to wash.
The boys have given up soda and drink acqua minerale (mineral water),
either frizzante (with carbonation) or naturale.</TE>
<TE>   Each evening ends with a trip to Il Sorbetto, the gelato (ice
cream) shop where the boys can connect with their friends at home on
the Internet for $6 an hour. Before the shop closes an hour later,
they top the evening off with a cone. Renato, the kind man who owns
the shop, and his wife, Ida, who makes the gelato, have struck up a
friendship with my husband. They offer to run a tab so the boys can
pay their bill at the end of the week.</TE>
<TE>   The night when we are to pack for home, we decide to treat
ourselves to dinner in the "important" restaurant at the hotel. We
dress up for the first time. The boys, just 14, are still permitted
to wear a collared shirt and slacks, but men are required to wear
jackets in the dining room. On a glass-enclosed terrace, waiters in
white jackets carefully lift silver covers in unison. We listen to
the same live classical music that has been played in this room for
decades and watch the sun slowly descend.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its treacherous streets, Bellagio is definitely a walking
town. Except for a few short drives into the mountains to see the
vistas from above or to visit Silvio's, a fresh fish restaurant
outside town, our car remains parked in the lot outside the
residence. Two weeks have passed too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   As we leave Bellagio and head for the ferry that will take us
across the lake to the road that leads to Milan's Malpensa Airport,
we stop at the main hotel to check out and say goodbye to Luciano,
the concierge. With no hesitation, we tell Antonio, the reservations
manager, that we will be returning next year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Napoleon said "an army marches on its stomach"; so do tourists.
People enjoy their trips if the food is tasty and cheap; they're
dissatisfied if meals are dull and expensive. And the country that
can't provide decent dining at a reasonable price is doomed to lose
its vitality in tourism. Russia is an example.</LD>
<LD>   Visitors often can lower the cost and increase the enjoyment of
eating by making wise decisions. I've developed rules:</LD>
<LD>   * Eat what they're eating. Concentrate on local specialties: pasta
in Italy, steak-and-kidney pie in Britain, herring in Scandinavia,
moo goo gai pan in Taiwan. Local favorites are any nation's best
dishes, well prepared and usually inexpensive. Order your familiar
favorites instead--a U.S. hamburger, a martini, apple pie--and you'll
probably pay too much.</LD>
<TE>   * Drink what they're drinking. In a wine-drinking country (say,
Italy or France), order wine, not beer. The wine is marvelous and
inexpensive; the beer is no bargain. In a beer-drinking country
(Germany, Scandinavia), drink beer, not wine; the beer is cheap and
top-notch.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat what they're eating when they're eating it. Follow the food
patterns of the country you're in. If the habit is to have a tiny
breakfast and a giant lunch (Spain, France, Italy, Greece), have the
same. If, instead, you order a big breakfast in those countries,
you'll probably pay mightily for an inadequate meal. By contrast, if
the tradition in a particular nation is to have a giant breakfast and
a tiny lunch (Britain, Israel, Australia), do that: You'll find that
the mammoth breakfast is the best-prepared meal of the day and is
relatively inexpensive.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat less than you think you want. We all eat far more while
traveling than we usually do at home. We feel intimidated, among
other things, by foreign waiters. Will they think us "ugly Americans"
if we don't order a soup-to-nuts meal? At home, none of us would
dream of having four courses for lunch, yet overseas, we think it
obligatory to order the table d'hote meal and stuff ourselves into a
state of torpor at considerable expense, while the local resident at
the next table has a refreshing, inexpensive single plate.</TE>
<TE>   * Divide and conquer. Order one plate for the two of you, or an
appetizer for her and a main course for him, and split them. You'll
still have more than enough, and you'll save money. The servings in
most tourist restaurants are enough for a family. (I exclude, of
course, haute cuisine places, which usually have tiny portions.)</TE>
<TE>   How many times have you ordered a meat course for yourself that
turns out to be so large you can't finish it? By ordering, say, one
prime rib for two of you, you will end up with plenty, and you'll
save $17 or so at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat picnic-style once a day. Instead of going to restaurants
three times a day, alternate the routine; make one of those meals a
cold, light snack, like a sandwich lunch at the hotel. Go to a
delicatessen, order pate, some cheese, two rolls, two tomatoes, a
pickle and wine, and take the lot to a park bench or a riverbank and
eat healthfully, cheerfully and for pocket change.</TE>
<TE>   * Look before you order. Never order a dish without knowing how
much it costs. Never patronize a restaurant that does not openly
display its menu outside. Order nothing listed at "today's market
price" or "s.g." (selon grosseur, according to weight).</TE>
<TE>   * Beware of waiters bearing gifts. Eat nothing that's been placed
on the table before your arrival (like a crock of pate); it may be
priced at princely levels. Refuse anything (other than bread, butter,
radishes and the like) brought to your table unbidden unless it's
explicitly described as free.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid the "household words." If the name of a restaurant springs
to mind in an unfamiliar city, it's because you've heard of it for
decades. And that means you're 20 years too late. The "household
words" are too often riding on their reputations and are overpriced.
They can afford to be.</TE>
<TE>   * Never eat at airports. Stick sandwiches in your suitcase or put
pastries in your purse. Conceal a banana in the magazine or the
newspaper that you're carrying. Do anything, but don't place yourself
in the position of having to buy a meal at an airport. Need I explain
why?</TE>
<TE>   * Patronize the marketplaces. When in doubt about where to eat in
a strange foreign city, head for the big marketplace, the stalls
under canvas or in a warehouse-like building where ingredients of
meals are sold.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever there's a marketplace, there's a nearby restaurant with
good prices for fresh food; that's because those marketplace eateries
buy the makings for their meals from people they deal with throughout
the day, at the best rates.</TE>

taxes, about $86 per person, are extra. Upgrades to larger motor
homes with bath are available at extra cost. The flight departs
Wednesdays. (800) 243-7227.</LD>

<HD>N.Y. Winter Garden to Reopen Its Glass Atrium, Entrance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Financial Center Winter Garden, a soaring 10-story,
glass-enclosed atrium that was severely damaged in the Sept. 11
attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, is to reopen Tuesday.
The garden's program of free music, dance and children's events will
resume Oct. 2 with a performance by the Ailey II dance troupe.</LD>
<LD>   More than 500 workers replaced 2,000 glass panes, rebuilt the
grand staircase and did other reconstruction on the garden, which was
designed by architect Cesar Pelli (creator of West Hollywood's
landmark Pacific Design Center) and opened in 1988. It has a new
glass-facade entrance, designed by Pelli and his son Rafael, facing
West Street.</LD>
<LD>   A list of fall events is available at
www.worldfinancialcenter.com. (Click on "Calendar.")</LD>
<TE>   In another sign of New York's recovery, two subway stations that
have been closed since the attacks were expected to reopen today. The
stations, along Lines 1 and 9 in Lower Manhattan, are at Rector
Street and South Ferry. (The two lines will bypass the damaged
Cortlandt Street station, the one nearest the World Trade Center
site.)</TE>
<TE>   Near ground zero, the first section of an observation wall, on the
west side of Church Street from Fulton to Cortlandt streets, opened
to victims' families last week and was to open to the public today.
Visitors can view the site through the wall's steel mesh fencing. The
wall's panels bear the names of more than 2,800 who died in the
attacks. Other sections are expected to open later this year.</TE>
<TE>   New York's tourism industry is also recovering, said NYC &amp; Co.,
which markets tourism for the city. Hotel occupancy rates this summer
were close to last year's, although the average room rate was still
down 10% or 15%, it said. The city finished 2001 with slightly more
domestic visitors than in 2000--about 29.5 million. But they stayed
fewer days and spent less than in 2000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's an exhibit you can get your mind around: a survey of 40 years
of work by flamboyant artists Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude,
known for their large-scale public artworks that swaddle landscapes
and landmarks in cloth.</LD>
<LD>   The La Jolla branch of the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego
will open the show on Sept. 22 and will add some unique drawings,
many never displayed before. Pieces include sketches and collages for
"Running Fence, Sonoma and Marin Counties, 1972-76" and "Wrapped
Reichstag, Berlin, 1975-95," plus photos and models of completed
projects.</LD>
<LD>   The show originated at the National Gallery of Art in Washington,
D.C., earlier this year.</LD>
<TE>   The exhibit ends Jan. 5. The museum is open daily except
Wednesdays; hours vary. Adult admission is $6. (858) 454-3541,

<HD>River Cruise Firm Offers Cancellation Protection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles-based Uniworld, which runs river cruises in Europe and
elsewhere, is offering a "cancel-for-any-reason" plan, at extra cost,
to its customers. It claims to be the only river cruise company with
such a plan, although several ocean liner operators offer it.</LD>
<LD>   Cruise companies, including Uniworld, generally won't refund
customers' money beyond a certain date as long as the ship departs;
illness and weather problems do not merit refunds. Uniworld's
protection plan allows guests to cancel trips for any reason until
the day of departure and receive at least some of their money back or
get a credit toward a future cruise.</LD>
<LD>   The cost starts at $79 per person. The plan also covers against
trip interruption, accidents, medical expenses and evacuation, and
other events. For details, contact Uniworld, (800) 360-9550,
www.uniworld.com.</LD>

<HD>European Rail Passes Will Cost More in 2003</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prices for European rail passes are increasing again. They will cost
about 3% more starting Jan. 1, after increases of 3% to 5.5%,
depending on the pass, this year. The passes are good for travel six
months after purchase, so you can beat the increase by buying your
pass by Dec. 31 if you plan to travel within that period.</LD>
<LD>   There are dozens of types of passes. New for 2003 are four-and
five-country versions of the Eurail Selectpass, which generally allow
unlimited first-class travel on a given number of days within a
two-month period. (This year there is only a three-country option.)
Four-country Selectpasses start at $398 for five days or $340 per
person when two people travel together. (888) 382-7245,
www.raileurope.com.</LD>
<LD>   This fall Eurostar, the high-speed train that links London with
Paris and Brussels, will run fewer trains on some weekends and cut
some weekend service to Disneyland Paris Resort because of rail
construction work. The company is offering 20% off some Eurostar
fares for travel Oct. 15 to Dec. 15. For details, contact Rail
Europe.</LD>

<HD>Hotel Hopes to Score Hit With 'Sopranos' Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Giving in to the mob psychology of "Sopranos" followers, the Four
Seasons Hotel New York has devised a "Sopranos Sundays" room-service
package that begins today with the premiere of the HBO series'
season. Guests can order dishes such as "Swimming With the Shellfish"
lobster minestrone soup ($12) and "Bada Bing" cherry parfait ($12),
named for the strip club on the show. Dinner will be served on a
red-and-white checkered tablecloth, and phone calls will be held
during the program.</LD>
<LD>   Feeling as rich as the series' mob kingpin, Tony Soprano? You can
stay in the hotel's new 2,000-square-foot Royal Suite for $9,500 per
night. It's the first of four new suites, up to 3,000 square feet, to
open; the others are expected to be available by next fall.</LD>

<KH>Weekend Escape</KH>
<HD>Strolling Portland and Loving It to the MAX</HD>
<DH>No need for a car with new light rail from the airport to
downtown</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER LOWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>When the doors of the MAX light-rail train whooshed closed, my
husband and I settled contentedly into our seats. Steps from baggage
claim at Portland International Airport, we had bought two tickets
from a machine ($3.10 total), strolled to a train and skipped the
whole nonsense of renting a car, waiting for a bus or catching a
costly cab.</LD>
<LD>   We were bound for downtown Portland, one of my favorite places. I
love its vibrant streets, its restaurants, its stores. Last fall,
Portland became the first city on the West Coast to extend a
light-rail system to its airport; the ride into downtown on the new
MAX Red Line is only about 35 minutes. So when a weekend opened up on
our calendar, we figured, why not head to the Northwest, footloose
and car free?</LD>
<LD>   The MAX, or Metropolitan Area Express, with its clean cars and
wide aisles for luggage, proved a great way into the city. Though it
made several stops, the train allowed us to rubberneck without
careening off the road. As the MAX crossed the Willamette River, the
Portland skyline glowed under a bright sun, and joggers and bikers
below us filled waterfront paths.</LD>
<TE>   I started getting excited at the familiar scene. My parents live
10 miles outside Portland, and our favorite activity when we stay
with them is to drive into downtown and play. We bounded off the
train by the Pioneer Place Shopping Center on Morrison Street and
headed to our hotel, the 5th Avenue Suites, two short blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Portland's planners long ago figured that to make their city
appealing--one to walk through and be experienced--they would shorten
the blocks. So while many city blocks around the country are at least
400 feet long, Portland's are half that, making for a wonderfully
walkable city.</TE>
<TE>   Shops, galleries and restaurants fill downtown, and street corners
are especially attractive spots because they lure people from more
than one direction. And if lively retail weren't enough, Portland
added other small but fun diversions to its streets, such as drinking
fountains that burble endlessly.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's "Portland's Living Room," also known as Pioneer
Courthouse Square, a sunken brick plaza where skateboarders,
musicians, chess players and coffee sippers hang out at all hours.</TE>
<TE>   Russ and I dropped off our bags at the hotel and walked about
eight of those short blocks to another Portland hangout, the Saturday
Market in the Skidmore area of Old Town. The MAX runs right by the
market (Skidmore Fountain stop), which bills itself as the nation's
largest continually operating open-air market. Parents pushed
strollers, teens lingered and tourists like us wandered among the
crafts, studying jewelry made with Mt. St. Helens ash and other
novelties.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its reputation, Portland actually gets less rain than such
cities as Atlanta and Houston. When the sun is out--as it was our
whole weekend--so is everyone.</TE>
<TE>   We wandered to the small park fronting the Willamette River and
eyed the new 1 1/2-mile Esplanade on the east bank across the way.
Part of the riverside path floats in the water. Portland's active set
can complete a three-mile loop by crossing a couple of the city's
historic bridges. We had hoped to be this active, but it was hot.</TE>
<TE>   So back to the hotel we went to cool off and get ready for dinner.
The 5th Avenue was pleasant, our large suite ($119 plus tax per
night) welcoming. The bedroom had a view of snowcapped Mt. Hood, and
the living room was large enough that we could host my parents, who
drove in to join us.</TE>
<TE>   We walked a few blocks to what has become our favorite restaurant,
Jake's Grill, a smaller version of Jake's Famous Crawfish, an 1892
Portland landmark a few blocks away. Dark wood gives the Grill a
clubby atmosphere, but big windows looking onto the street bring
light. The bar is lively and the wait staff attentive. We did the
Northwest fish thing--grilled salmon salad, stuffed trout--with a
berry cobbler for dessert.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday we walked a few blocks to Mother's Bistro &amp; Bar for brunch.
The restaurant is in an old, high-ceilinged building decorated inside
with framed prints of mothers. The atmosphere was suitably Portland
funky, and we briefly thought about coming back for dinner, where the
menu tends toward comfort foods such as pot roast, meatloaf and
macaroni and cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Well fortified, we walked back to a MAX stop and bought tickets
for a ride to the Oregon Zoo. This time I didn't read the machine
quite right and ended up shelling out a buck or two extra for "all
zones" tickets.</TE>
<TE>   MAX has two lines: the five-mile Red Line to the airport and the
33-mile Blue Line between Hillsboro and Gresham, both looping through
downtown. Fares are based on zones; the farther you go, the more it
costs. The core of downtown, though, is "Fareless Square," where
riders pay nothing to hop on and off MAX between the Oregon
Convention Center to the east and 10th Avenue to the west.</TE>
<TE>   We rolled past brick buildings and green trees, entered a tunnel
through Portland's volcanic rock West Hills, then got off at the Blue
Line's Washington Park stop, the deepest transit station in the
country at 260 feet underground.</TE>
<TE>   The day had grown gorgeous--sunny and in the 70s--and the air was
forest fresh. We wandered through the zoo for a couple of hours,
watching fruit bats hanging upside-down gnawing cantaloupe, and musk
ox hanging out beside their own stream.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the zoo we boarded a small steam train to cross Forest
Park, 5,000 hilly acres overlooking the city. Ferns crowded the
forest floor, and trees towered above us. It was as though we were
deep in the woods, not minutes from the city. At the train's halfway
point, we got off and explored the city's renowned rose garden--9,000
plants glowing in pink, red, yellow, mauve and salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was back to the MAX, where we got off at PGE Park at 18th
Avenue and Morrison Street. With two $5 general admission tickets, we
sat and watched the Beavers, Portland's minor-league baseball team,
play in front of an enthusiastic crowd. With a cold, locally brewed
beer and a coffee, it was a great break. We were fanned by a pleasant
breeze and caught up in the fun with 8,000 cheering fans.</TE>
<TE>   We had made dinner plans before coming, a good idea because the
hot restaurants--many of them small bistros--fill up on weekends.
Northwest Portland has its trendy eateries, while the up-and-coming
Pearl District also has hot spots. Both of those scenes are within
walking distance of the public Portland Streetcar, which runs
north-south across the city.</TE>
<TE>   But around the block from our hotel was Typhoon, a restaurant
tucked into the Hotel Lucia, one of the city's new boutique lodgings.
We thought our pad Thai, stir-fried eggplant in black bean sauce and
pineapple shrimp some of the best Thai food we had eaten recently.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning we darted into a Starbucks, one of five coffee
shops steps from the hotel lobby (and all were busy!), then walked to
Powell's City of Books on West Burnside Street--a reason in itself to
go to Portland. Among the city's biggest draws, Powell's is one of
the largest independent bookstores in the world, with hundreds of
subject categories from "activism" to "zines" spread throughout nine
large, color-coded rooms that take up a city block.</TE>
<TE>   Printed maps are offered to shoppers as soon as they walk in. (You
can download the map at powells.com before you go and plan your
shopping spree.) We've spent hours here, sometimes sitting with
coffee in the store's cafe, but mostly roaming. Powell's also has a
free walking map of the city that guides you past notable buildings,
bridges and parks.</TE>
<TE>   But we had to go. We ate our goodbye meal at Higgins, a popular
restaurant on Broadway, where the kitchen turns out dishes with a
Northwest bent. I had pasta with a hazelnut pesto, which sounded odd
but was delicious.</TE>
<TE>   We collected our bags from the hotel, dawdled those two short
blocks to the MAX (we didn't want to leave) and soon were riding back
to the airport. (I might have to go back sooner than I thought; air
fares have dropped since our visit, and persistent bargain hunters
can probably find two round-trip tickets in the neighborhood of
$300.)</TE>
<TE>   As we stood, finally, curbside at the Burbank airport, breathing
in bus fumes, I looked a little longingly into the distance. Was that
a light-rail train coming our way or just a shuttle bus caught in the
glare?</TE>

<HD>As Airlines Change Rules, Passengers Hold the Bag</HD>
<DH>Tighter restrictions on low-fare tickets, extra luggage and
frequent-flier upgrades are among new headaches for fliers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major U.S. airlines, facing unprecedented deficits, are scouting out
cost savings and new revenue at a frantic pace. In the last month
their quest has driven changes that affect nearly every passenger.</LD>
<LD>   Many have cut flight schedules. Some have slapped a
"use-it-or-lose-it" restriction on certain low-fare tickets, made
frequent-flier upgrades more difficult to get, raised prices for
paper tickets and enforced stricter baggage rules.</LD>
<LD>   Keeping up with fluctuations in the airlines' already complex
policies can be daunting--and infuriating. Several of these changes
have been imposed with little or no notice. The American Society of
Travel Agents and the Business Travel Coalition have denounced the
tightening of ticket rules and other revisions, and even some
industry advisors are dismayed.</LD>
<TE>   "When you start to beat up the passenger with ... rules, you've
forgotten what business you're in," says Mike Boyd, president of the
Boyd Group/Aviation Systems Research Corp., an aviation consulting
company in Evergreen, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   The majors contend that belt-tightening, which has also forced
thousands of layoffs, is essential to survive in a marketplace of
declining air fares and fewer passengers, especially the big-ticket
business travelers who sustained them for years.</TE>
<TE>   With airlines making revisions almost daily, it is important to
call the carrier, check its Internet site or call your travel agent
to make sure your flight hasn't been canceled or a new fee or rule
imposed.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a snapshot of some recent changes affecting U.S. airline
passengers. It was accurate as of the Travel section's deadline
Tuesday, but the situation may have changed since then.</TE>
<TE>   * Nonrefundable tickets: Many of the low-cost, advance-purchase
fares that leisure travelers buy are nonrefundable. In the past, that
has generally meant you would pay up to $100, plus any difference
between the original and the new fare, to change your itinerary.
Unused fares wouldn't be refunded but could be applied to a new
flight for up to one year.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, refundable fares, generally more expensive, allow
changes without penalty.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 27, US Airways said that, effective immediately, its
nonrefundable fares would have no value once the flight departed. It
also said passengers on those fares wouldn't be allowed to fly
standby on an alternate flight. Ten days later it announced that,
starting Jan. 1, such passengers would be able to stand by on the
original date of travel but would be charged $100 to do so. Such
passengers could still make changes in the itinerary up to departure,
for a fee.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 30, American announced a similar policy, effective
starting that day for tickets bought for travel Oct. 1 or later.
Standby passengers on nonrefundable fares are charged a $100 change
fee.</TE>
<TE>   Continental followed suit Aug. 31, effective immediately. It
issued no announcement, but reservations agents told callers about
the change when they booked, says spokesman Rahsaan Johnson. Those
who booked on the airline's Internet site had to click on "penalty
rules" in fine print under "Rules and Restrictions," then wade into
the seventh page of a 34-page document to find the new restrictions.
The home page contained no announcement when I checked last week.</TE>
<TE>   As with some other airlines, Continental's new rules could take up
a column in themselves. Some highlights: Effective for travel Oct. 1
and later, holders of nonrefundable fares can rebook without a change
fee if they arrive within two hours after the original flight,
Johnson said; no-shows lose their tickets. Those traveling Jan. 1 or
later will generally pay a $100 fee for standby.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 5, Northwest and Delta made similar changes to
nonrefundable tickets, effective for travel Oct. 1 and later; United
followed Sept. 6. Delta and United will add a $100 change fee for
standbys starting Jan. 1</TE>
<TE>   Want a simpler and cheaper alternative? Try Southwest, which
doesn't have change fees (although you may need to pay the difference
between the old and new fare) and which credits unused tickets up to
a year from purchase. Or JetBlue, which charges a $25 change fee
(although no-shows generally lose their ticket).</TE>
<TE>   * Frequent-flier programs: With US Airways' recent filing for
Chapter 11 reorganization and rumors that another airline or two may
be headed that way, frequent fliers are fretting about losing their
miles.</TE>
<TE>   But they probably won't, if the past is any guide.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Chapter 11 filers, US Airways is still operating.
Continental and America West went in and out of bankruptcy in the
1990s without fliers losing miles, says Tim Winship, publisher of
FrequentFlier.com. When American bought bankrupt TWA, it bought its
frequent-flier program as well; in the past other airlines honored
miles from bankrupt Eastern and Pan Am. But frequent fliers lost
miles when Midway went under in 1991, Winship notes.</TE>
<TE>   For the truly worried, Winship suggests signing up with
AwardGuard, a program founded by Randy Petersen, editor and publisher
of Inside Flyer magazine. It will insure the value of your miles up
to $7,500 worth of award tickets for $119 per year; details are on
the Web site, www.privilegeflyer.com.</TE>
<TE>   Several airlines have recently begun applying $100 change fees to
frequent-flier award travel, Petersen says. As of Oct. 1, United's
frequent fliers will need 50,000 instead of 30,000 miles to obtain
one-class upgrades good for eight 500-mile segments; buying upgrades
with cash will cost about 60% more than it does now.</TE>
<TE>   * Stricter baggage, other rules: With one day's notice last month,
Delta began charging $40 for checking a third bag, and on Sept. 4,
effective that day, US Airways began charging $80. Northwest,
Continental, United and Alaska earlier began charging $50 to $80,
depending on the airline. Some are also more strictly enforcing
charges for overweight bags that were already on the books.</TE>
<TE>   Continental last month announced that it plans a "disciplined
adherence" to collecting excess baggage charges and, in general,
"rigid enforcement of all fare rules and a new, strict policy against
'waivers and favors.' " On Sept. 3 it began charging $10 for a
garment-bag box (formerly free) and raised the price of a bike box
from $15 to $20 and of a pet kennel from $30 to $45.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a small but cruel lost perk is this one from US Airways:
"On transatlantic flights, alcoholic beverages will no longer be
offered for free to economy-class passengers."</TE>
<TE>   Too bad. After the last month's turbulence, many of them could
probably use a drink.</TE>

<HD>Got Those End-of-Summer Blues? Snag a Vacation After Peak
Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EILEEN OGINTZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everybody has the same symptoms: malaise and crankiness, combined
with minor aches, pains and frustrations.</LD>
<LD>   Relax: It's not West Nile virus, just the end-of-summer-vacation
blues. As eager as we may be to get the kids back in school and out
of the house, we're never quite ready for vacation to end. "How'd the
summer go by so fast?" one friend demanded to know.</LD>
<LD>   But just because the summer is over doesn't mean you can't slip
away for a couple of days of fun in the sun. Those whose kids aren't
yet in school are lucky because you can snare a bargain at some
resorts you couldn't afford during the peak travel season. You'll get
better service too, without the crowds.</LD>
<TE>   Here are some good choices:</TE>
<TE>   * Dance the hula at the Outrigger Wailea Resort on Maui, where
children get a free connecting room until mid-December and eat free.
Kids will love the five pools, water playground and Cowabunga Club.
Parents will enjoy the spa, and the luau is one of the best in the
islands. Packages start at $425 per night.</TE>
<TE>   Other Outrigger hotels in Hawaii are offering fall deals at up to
40% off, with rates starting at less than $100 a night at the
Outrigger Kiahuna Plantation on Kauai. Call (800) 688-7444 or visit
www.outrigger.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Get up close and personal with the moose and elk at Yellowstone
this winter while the kids snowshoe and learn to track animals as
part of the Yellowstone Assn. Institute's new "Yellowstone for
Families" program, designed for families with kids 8 to 12.</TE>
<TE>   The program, available in January and most of February, is led by
a naturalist guide and includes three nights' lodging, several meals
and activities. Rates start at $383 for adults and $268 for kids.
Call (307) 344-5566.</TE>
<TE>   This fall there's also unexpected room availability at some
national park lodges. Xanterra Parks and Resorts is the country's
largest operator of national park lodges. Visit www.xanterra.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Visit London for Thanksgiving with a $669 package from Los
Angeles or San Francisco offered by Virgin Vacations. The package
includes round-trip air fare, three nights in hotels, daily breakfast
and restaurant discount coupons.</TE>
<TE>   Ask about rates for other packages that include stays in
apartments rather than hotels. Call (888) 937-8474 or visit
www.virgin.com/vacations.</TE>
<TE>   * Play in the leaves at Vermont's Killington Mountain Resort,
where a weekend starts at $47 per person and includes two nights'
lodging and a round-trip gondola ride. For $20 more, add a pass to
the Adventure Center or greens fees and a round of golf on the
18-hole Killington Golf Course. At the Adventure Center you can enjoy
mountain biking, in-line skating, miniature golf and an alpine slide.
Call (877) 458-4637 or visit www.killingtonresortvillage.com;
reservations must be made by phone.</TE>
<TE>   * Through Oct. 15, single parents can hit the water slides, take
on the kids in the latest video games or grab some R&amp;R while the kids
are at camp at Beaches family resorts, including the newest, Boscobel
Beach in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, which offers a petting zoo and free
golf, without paying the $160-per-night single supplement for sharing
a room with the kids. All-inclusive rates at Boscobel start at $255
per person, and $80 for kids to age 15. Call (800) 232-2437 or visit
www.beaches.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Use your room key to go to the front of the lines at Universal
Studios and Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Fla., when you stay at
one of Universal's three hotels. Fall packages at the newest, Royal
Pacific Resort, start at $99 per adult and $76.95 for kids and
include two-day unlimited passes for the two parks as well as store
discounts. There's a three-night minimum stay. Call (800) 232-7827 or
visit www.universalorlando.com.</TE>
<TE>   Order the Orlando Magic Card, which can save a family of four as
much as $500. To get it and to find other deals, visit the Orlando
Convention and Visitors Bureau Web site at www.orlandoinfo.com, or
call (800) 551-0181.</TE>

<HD>Tips Keep the Cruise Workers Afloat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your article "Cruise Control: On Some Lines, Tips Are Automatic"
(Travel Insider, Aug. 18) leaves out some important aspects of cruise
gratuities. Many cruise line employees are underpaid. Even on lines
where gratuities are included, wages tend to be low. Cruise lines can
continue these exploitative practices because their ships are
registered in other countries, so they don't have to comply with U.S.
labor laws.</LD>
<LD>   Many cruise employees are separated from their families for long
periods and work well beyond eight-hour days for wages that teenage
baby-sitters would consider inadequate.</LD>
<LD>   Although I can sympathize with American travelers wishing to
understand how they will be expected to tip, it is equally important
for them to understand how much cruise employees may be relying on
their largess. Cruise prices are wonderfully low if one chooses to
discount the human cost of the equation.</LD>
<TE>   SHIRA JACOBSON-ROGERS</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the letter "Sink Automatic Tips, Cruise Fan Says"
(Letters, Aug. 25): We agree that cruise passengers should be able to
tip whatever is appropriate to the crew rather than to have a fee
added to the cruise price, but not if it results in depriving the
staff of hard-earned and well-deserved remuneration. Too many
customers may use this as an excuse not to tip at all. If you can't
afford the tip, don't go in the first place. And don't use poor
service as an excuse not to tip. Crew members are usually
hard-working and from economically deprived countries. They deserve
and earn their gratuities.</TE>

<LD>In response to "Clean Sheets and Spreads" (Letters, Sept. 1): I was a
housekeeper and operations manager for more than 10 years in
different hotels. No hotel company I know of (including those
charging $350 a night and up) cleans a blanket or bedspread after
each checkout. As at home, they are laundered or dry-cleaned as
needed.</LD>
<LD>   If they were laundered after each checkout, a hotel would have to
have at least three bedspreads and blankets per bed. The number of
dry-cleaning or washing machines would probably double. The hotel
would have to increase its staff to process these heavy items. The
chemicals required to launder them would further destroy the
environment (especially if they were dry-cleaned).</LD>
<LD>   Are hotel guests willing to pay $35 to $55 more a night to have a
freshly cleaned bedspread and blanket? I don't think so.</LD>

<LD>I went to Cuba in February with Elderhostel. You didn't mention it as
a resource in "While Ban Is Debated, Americans Are Flocking to Cuba"
(Travel Insider, Sept. 1). The group offers tours on art and
architecture, ecological diversity and Cuban culture and history.
Many universities also offer tours; groups from Stanford and UCLA
were staying in our hotel. It's an interesting country, and I
recommend it to the curious traveler.</LD>

<HD>In Paris, Canvassing an Old Art District</HD>
<DH>The colorful 17th arrondissement paints a vibrant portrait
of life in the City of Light</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN JAMES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>People who like French Impressionist and Postimpressionist art are
familiar with Paris' 17th arrondissement, whether they know it or
not.</LD>
<LD>   Claude Monet and his contemporaries painted the great steam
engines that puffed through the 17th arrondissement on their way to
Gare St-Lazare, the train depot just to the south. Edouard Vuillard
painted portraits of his mother in her apartment on the 17th's trendy
Boulevard des Batignolles. And pointillist Georges Seurat captured
Parisians at play on a Sunday afternoon on Ile de la Grande Jatte,
the tiny isle that lies nearby in the middle of the River Seine.</LD>
<LD>   Today, art schools still thrive here and give the district a
bohemian air. Film crews stake out its picturesque 19th century
alleyways and broad boulevards lined with restaurants and boutiques.
(In the hit film "Amelie," the title character's love interest was
raised in Batignolles, a village within the 17th that's a postcard of
mansard roofs and red geranium-stuffed window boxes.)</LD>
<TE>   Of Paris' arrondissements--the 20 numbered districts that start in
the city's geographic center and swirl out counterclockwise--the 17th
hardly ranks as a top draw. North of the Louvre, the Champs-Elysees
and other major attractions, the 17th's only well-known landmark is
the Arc de Triomphe, which stands at the district's southern
boundary. In my wanderings last spring, I came across few other
tourists. And that's a large part of the area's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Designed in 1860 by Paris' renowned urban planner Baron
Georges-Eugene Haussmann, the 17th arrondissement enclosed a
cluttered collection of middle-class aspirations--industrial,
architectural and artistic. It was--and still is--an eclectic area of
industrial railways, serene stretches of parkland enlivened by
marionette theaters and carousels, and soaring glass-block buildings
along the main thoroughfares. Among its historical footnotes: The
Eiffel Tower was designed and built here, and composer Maurice Ravel
of "Bolero" fame maintained a discreet pied-a-terre in the center of
the district.</TE>
<TE>   For visitors like me, who have already seen Paris' best-known
sights, the 17th arrondissement holds the promise of the city's
often-overlooked, day-in-the-life charms. There is no Eiffel Tower
here, but you can still watch the trains chug their way into the
city, see artists at work in ateliers on narrow cul-de-sacs, or join
a rainbow of umbrellas on a drizzly day in the Square des
Batignolles, where locals feed bread crumbs to flocks of fussy ducks.
To me, this is the real Paris--worthy of a stay in its own right, or
at least a day trip.</TE>
<TE>   This was the colorful backdrop we had in mind when my siblings and
I gave my mother, Bobbe, a Paris holiday for her 80th birthday.
Mother is a fan of Seurat, the inspiration behind Mandy Patinkin's
character in "Sunday in the Park With George," for all you Stephen
Sondheim followers. Seurat's painting "Sunday Afternoon on the Island
of La Grande Jatte" (now at the Art Institute of Chicago) inspired us
to visit this island in the Seine.</TE>
<TE>   What, I wondered, did La Grande Jatte look like now? Did stately
Parisians still stroll through the grass beneath spindly trees? Was
there anything left of Seurat's moment in time--that moment when the
19th century was drawing to a close and the modern age was a smoky
stain on the horizon?</TE>
<TE>   Getting to La Grande Jatte, just north of the 17th arrondissement,
proved surprisingly easy. From the last stop of Metro Line 3, Pont de
Levallois Becon, I walked about 10 minutes to a footbridge from the
Quai Michelet on the south bank of the Seine to the island.</TE>
<TE>   Well-maintained, mansion-size houseboats ran in a neat line down
the bank almost to the Levallois bridge. Small dinghies clung to the
sterns like children hanging onto their mothers' dresses. In the
distance, a few smokestacks still sent white plumes into the air,
blown by the wind and dispersed toward the horizon. This scene, at
least, the artist would have recognized.</TE>
<TE>   The rest would look different. La Grande Jatte has been built over
with houses and apartment blocks. The road along the island's
southern edge is named for Seurat, but it is the eastern end where he
would probably feel at home.</TE>
<TE>   Here the river has cut high, steep banks that fall to swirling
water. Poplar trees shade a paved path along the northern bank.
Residents of central Paris no longer come here in droves for the day,
but locals do: joggers, parents pushing strollers, retired couples
walking the dog. Songbirds compete with the groan of barges, which
still sweep up and down the river. At high tide, the water turns some
areas into a swamp of sorts, and ducks no longer have to share the
space with city dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   Seurat was so taken with this place that another one of his
masterpieces, "Bathers at Asnieres," was set across the river from La
Grande Jatte. Though the landscape has changed, it was not hard for
me to summon the spirit of the artist. As we walked along the river
path toward the bridge, a man reclined on his back, propped up on his
arms like the pipe smoker in Seurat's "La Grande Jatte." A small dog
dashed by, looking for all the world like the beribboned pooch the
painter had so carefully recorded.</TE>
<TE>   Up on the bridge, high above the northeastern point of the island,
the silhouettes of people passed to and fro in the gray light of late
morning. To the southwest toward the Pont de Courbevoie, the bridge
where Seurat painted a loving landscape of jetties and boats and
fishermen, a sailor in a red jacket pulled in a sailboat. Above him,
a gabled yellow house added another color to my visual canvas.</TE>
<TE>   All of the people-watching had made Mother and me hungry, so we
walked to the landmark Cafe la Jatte on Boulevard Vital Bouhot. In
the 1991 film "Company Business," Gene Hackman trades drinks and spy
talk with a sultry Frenchwoman in this restaurant. Ever since I saw
the film--and the skeleton of a massive marine dinosaur called a
plesiosaur, which hangs from the ceiling--I knew I had to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Cafe la Jatte is an open, airy space of black beams and brick,
linen-covered tables and harlequin-patterned chairs. While dodging
some of the most aggressive sparrows I have ever encountered--dive
bombers and aerial acrobats that flew loops over the breadbasket--we
tried to enjoy what turned out to be a good lunch. Mother ordered a
salad of crabmeat, avocado, shrimp and grapefruit; I devoured salad
greens topped with smoked salmon, cold cooked potatoes and olive oil
with crushed peppercorns. We shared a creme brulee that had us
dueling spoons like musketeers. It was expensive--meals easily can
run $30 or more per person--but the food was worth it.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch we headed for the National Museum Jean-Jacques Henner
in the 17th arrondissement. Henner (1829-1905) was an Alsatian
painter whose works are displayed in a 19th century house. It's under
renovation, but two of the three floors remain open. Admired in his
own time, Henner has been largely forgotten, which is too bad.</TE>
<TE>   Although his style changed with every new mode--and there were
many during his lifetime--Henner painted portraits with a
timelessness that I found just as worthy as his more famous
contemporaries. His oil-on-wood portrait of his niece Eugenie and
nephew Jules shows the influence of Manet, and his 1874 portrait of
Henriette Germain owes a debt to Renoir. They are lovely paintings,
and the house itself is typical of what the nouveaux riches built as
the 17th arrondissement evolved throughout the 1800s.</TE>
<TE>   Another morning Mother and I went shopping along the 17th's Rue
des Dames and Rue de Levis. The latter was partly blocked by a crew
filming an eye-catching scene: a red-haired woman in a
mustard-colored cloak talking to a midget in an apron.
Walkie-talkie-waving men in black shooed shoppers away, so we never
did find out more about the project.</TE>
<TE>   We ducked into a little bookshop called Fontaine, where I bought
two volumes of the "Harry Potter" series in French for my niece, who
is studying the language, then ordered cafe creme at Cafe le Sauret.
Just off Rue des Dames we came across a short pedestrian street,
Passage Geffroy Didelot, lined with French flags. Through large
windows, we could see into a series of ateliers where brightly
splashed canvases crowded the walls. In one room, a man with dark
curls carefully laid a stroke of paint on a canvas just out of sight.
He pushed his chair back, studied the stroke, scooted forward and
laid down another stroke before pausing once again.</TE>
<TE>   Next door was a dentist's office. A woman in white created a
dental plate with much the same intensity. The juxtaposition made me
smile: art and industry overlapping. That's the 17th.</TE>
<TE>   On our last day we nudged ourselves southeast, just across the
border into the 9th arrondissement, to the Musee de la Vie
Romantique, or the museum of the Romantic period.</TE>
<TE>   The converted 19th century house contains novelist George Sand's
collections, including a model of the left hand of one of her lovers,
Frederic Chopin, and a necklace of Egyptian scarabs.</TE>
<TE>   An exhibit of Martine Franck portraits of French notables lined
the walls of one room. We also saw a portrait of Sand, a
motherly-looking woman with a long, intelligent face. It is hard to
imagine her dressed in trousers and top hat, smoking a cigar and
attracting a coterie of lovers.</TE>
<TE>   We ate quiche and salad in the museum's garden and watched white
clouds sail across a flawless sky. Like the rest of Paris, we
decided, the 17th arrondissement has many faces, and as Hemingway so
memorably wrote, the journey is always worth the effort.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: This "Mona Lisa" brought a smile to the face of
Pasadena reader Kent Ragstone, who took the photo a couple of years
ago in Columbus, Ohio. The re-creation of Leonardo da Vinci's
masterpiece is painted on the brick wall of the Reality Theatre in
the city's Short North Arts District of galleries, restaurants and
nightclubs. To achieve a sense of scale, Ragstone had to coax a shy
stranger to pose in front of the wall.  "I thought it would be more
small-town," says Ragstone, who was touring Ohio with her father, who
grew up there. "Columbus was more sophisticated than I expected--the
arts, the architecture--it was nice."</CP>

<HD>Careful Planning and Little Comforts Can Help Smooth the
Way for Seniors</HD>

<LD>It's said that you don't know a man until you walk a mile in his
shoes. And you also don't know what it's like for older people to
travel until you accompany one on a trip.</LD>
<LD>   After flying with my elderly father from Washington, D.C., to L.A.
in July, I began to realize that a companion has important tasks that
can make a journey easier on older people. Most of the tips have to
do with flying, such as packing snacks, putting prescriptions in
carry-ons and taking a light blanket, which was invaluable to my
father because he tended to get cold.</LD>
<LD>   I booked nonstop tickets on JetBlue to avoid tiring,
discombobulating connections, and we flew into small, manageable Long
Beach Airport, which kept my dad from feeling overwhelmed. Even
though my father could walk, I arranged with the airline for
wheelchair assistance, which meant we got to board first and were
given easily accessible bulkhead seats.</LD>
<TE>   When I took him back to the airport for his return flight to
Washington, I got permission from JetBlue to wait with him at the
gate instead of saying goodbye at the security checkpoint. I wished
he'd had a first-class seat and access to a comfortable airline club.
Better yet, I wish I had flown with him both ways. As I watched the
attendant wheel him to the lift that took him from the tarmac to the
plane, I felt like an anxious mom sending her child to school for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   Things can go awry on a plane trip. Dr. Alan Spira, a Beverly
Hills travel medicine specialist, says that seniors may be especially
prone to blood clots from long stints in economy-class seating.
Swelling of lower legs and feet is common too, for which Spira
recommends compression stockings.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the horrifying story about Joe and Margie
Dabney, who flew from Indianapolis to LAX in December. When they
landed at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, a wheelchair
attendant met them to help with a connection. But somehow Margie, who
had Alzheimer's disease, disappeared, and she remained missing as of
the Travel section's deadline Tuesday. (The national Alzheimer's
Assn. says that half the 4 million people who suffer the disease
wander away at times.)</TE>
<TE>   I didn't need to worry about my father wandering away; at 82, his
mind was sharper than mine. But his hearing was poor, so I worried
about what would happen if he missed an important announcement.
Fortunately, everything went just fine. Careful planning made the
trip successful. This involves finding out about available services
for seniors, beginning when you book a flight. It's important to tell
the agent the senior's age and degree of mobility so requests, such
as a wheelchair or a special meal, can be noted. Talula Guntner, a
professor of travel and tourism at Northern Virginia Community
College in Annandale and a specialist in mature travel, says the
efficiency of wheelchair service for seniors varies, not so much from
airline to airline but based on the sensitivity of the personnel. On
a plane or cruise ship, she says, you have to "keep after it" by
booking the wheelchair and calling back later to reconfirm.</TE>
<TE>   Some seniors with reasonable mobility bristle at the idea of using
a wheelchair, even though it makes passage through crowded terminals
easier and faster. Guntner advises their travel companions to say,
"Please, do it for me. Wheelchair attendants take shortcuts, and
we'll get priority seating." Information about airport facilities for
seniors (and disabled travelers), such as pay telephones for
hearing-impaired travelers or elevators and bathrooms with handicap
facilities, is available on most airline Web sites. The Travelers Aid
Society at LAX (www.tasla.org) and other hubs provides attendants to
help older people make flight connections (though its personnel
aren't allowed to push wheelchairs).</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines' SkyCAAre program allows passengers to arrange,
at the time of flight booking, for emergency room-trained nurses to
accompany them every step of the way. SkyCAAre nurses help with meals
and getting around and, in an emergency, can administer medical aid.</TE>
<TE>   The service costs $90 an hour (charged during flight time only)
and requires the passenger to purchase a seat for the nurse (at a 30%
discount). Dr. David McKenas, American Airlines' medical director,
says the service often is used for seniors transferring to or from
nursing homes, though elderly vacationers traveling with relatives
use it because it relieves their companions.</TE>
<TE>   Before flying with my father, I had hoped to take him with me on a
trip to Switzerland, which involved an overnight flight to Zurich,
immediately followed by a five-hour train ride to Zermatt. He
couldn't make it, which turned out to be a good thing. I hadn't
planned the trip with an 82-year-old in mind, and it taxed even me.</TE>
<TE>   Next time I travel with a senior, I'll know better. And
because they make such excellent companions, I hope there will be a
next time.</TE>

<LD>They're called eclipse chasers. They're obsessed with traveling to
the corners of the Earth to witness total solar eclipses, which cause
a bright daytime sky to plunge suddenly into deep twilight.</LD>
<LD>   Now you can join in the adventure.</LD>
<LD>   A solar eclipse safari will journey to the heart of the Australian
outback, led by veteran African explorer Eddie Frank and NASA
astronomer Laurence Doyle. The trip will depart Los Angeles on Nov.
28 and return Dec. 7.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the most surreal thing," said Frank, who led a similar tour
last year to Zambia. "You're surrounded by daylight and suddenly
stars are visible. Animals go to sleep. It's totally captivating.
People say it's the largest natural event you can witness without
some kind of destruction also taking place," such as in an
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   The eclipse will occur Dec. 4 but will be visible only in the
Southern Hemisphere. Its path will start in the Atlantic Ocean off
the coast of Angola, moving east across Africa before crossing into
the Indian Ocean. It will appear over southern Australia late in the
afternoon. Australia is considered a good place to view this eclipse
because rain or clouds are unlikely. The next total solar eclipse in
North America will not take place until 2017.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $3,320 per person, double occupancy, including hotels in
Sydney, Adelaide and near the viewing site; all meals; train from
Sydney to Adelaide; other land transportation, activities and
lectures. Round-trip add-on air fare from Los Angeles is $1,359.</TE>

<HD>Vegas' Coolest Pools</HD>
<DH>In this city that sizzles, all hotels are not created equal
when it comes to water worlds. Two pool aficionados rate some of the
best and worst on and off the Strip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE FRIESS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Aside from the Regis Philbin slots, underdressed cocktail waitresses
and overpriced room service, there's one thing that every hotel on or
near the Las Vegas Strip has in common: a pool. Or, in the parlance
of the resort business, a "water feature."</LD>
<LD>   But not all water features are created equal in Las Vegas. Some
are inventive expanses with sandy beaches, waterfalls and bubbly hot
tubs. Others are mundane, obligatory water-filled holes in the ground
that reflect little of the kitschfor which Las Vegas is famous.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the reams of type produced about a city that greets more
than 30 million tourists annually, I've never read a comprehensive
examination of the most important part of the daytime experience when
visiting this city of 110-degree afternoons.</LD>
<TE>   We decided it was time somebody compared them, and we were just
the people for the job.</TE>
<TE>   What you find here are the opinions of a 29-year-old pool
aficionado and six-year resident of Vegas and my 12-year-old "little
brother" Jamie Koch, whom I mentor through the Big Brothers Big
Sisters of America program. It wasn't hard to hook Jamie on the
project: He's so addicted to water features that his eyes sparkle
when he sees a fountain at the mall.</TE>
<TE>   Our one-month study, completed in August, spanned 20 pools on and
near the Strip. We applied a set of criteria that included the
tangible and intangible. Did this water feature display any
innovations? Did it fit the hotel's theme? Was it any deeper than the
typical 3 to 4 feet of most Strip pools? Did it meet the expectations
of a new resort? Was it clean? Was the layout logical or clever? What
were the lifeguards' attitudes? Did they look bored? Was the pool
"swimmable"--meaning, did it invite us to jump in, and was the water
temperate?</TE>
<TE>   Almost all the pools topped out at 4 feet and not one had a diving
board, presumably an insurance liability issue. (One lifeguard at
Luxor confided that his most frequent reason for diving in was to
rescue drunken guests.)</TE>
<TE>   The resorts' pools are not typically open to locals or non-guests.
In many cases, as at the ultra-exclusive Venetian, Bellagio, Four
Seasons and Mandalay Bay resorts, we went with friends who were
guests and who invited us. Other times we just walked in. In theory,
at the pool's towel desk, guests are expected to show the staff a
room key as proof that they belong, but in some cases we passed by
with a smile and a nod.</TE>
<TE>   Only two hotels--the Mirage and the Hard Rock--were so strict that
there was no way to visit them, so we omitted them from our survey.
Although we couldn't even glimpse the Mirage's pool from the
entrance, we did get an eyeful of the sensational sandy beach-like
spread at the Hard Rock (which issues wristbands to guests for
entrance) and guessed it would have ranked high in our study.</TE>
<TE>   We omitted other hotels on the Strip on mere whim, including
Bally's because it always struck us as a dull hotel, and Circus
Circus because the pool is tiny, crowded and not worth the ink.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there were thrills with the unexpected: The Flamingo,
which bests all its new, billion-dollar neighbors with slides,
waterfalls and live animals. The otherwise dull Tropicana, which
overachieves with a swim-up blackjack bar. And Caesars Palace's
topless Venus pool, which obviously offers its own specialist appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Flamingo: A+</TE>
<TE>   The scene: Who knew one of the oldest and least elaborate
casino-resorts on the Strip would have a backyard so big, so lush and
so much fun? The network of water slides would have been enough, but
there is also a second pool with a pounding 14-foot waterfall and a
third, more conventional and sedate pool for those seeking a calmer
atmosphere. Even that last one is clever, with 10-foot-tall concrete
pink flamingos elegantly and quietly spitting water out of their
beaks. Live flamingos and African penguins are on display in the
garden, a one-minute walk from the water area. Easy access for locals
too, because there's no one checking IDs.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "We'll be back. Awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 10. Is a flamingo pink? Dive in.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.50</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $4.50</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mandalay Bay: A+</TE>
<TE>   The scene: As we treaded water in the 7-foot-deep pool waiting for
the waves to start and sweep us to the sandy beach, we wondered: Why
didn't anybody think of this before the Mandalay opened in 1999?
There are also a lazy river, two more conventional pools and one that
had only adults in it. Lifeguards seem happy, vigilant and alert, a
rarity anywhere on the Strip. Wet 'n' wild it's not, but for a resort
trying to live up to its South Pacific theme, this place makes a heck
of a splash.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Just three more waves, OK? Please?"</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 10. You can't enjoy a good tsunami without getting
very wet.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.50</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $5.25</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palms: A</TE>
<TE>   The scene: Here's a new hotel that understands the importance of a
top-class water feature. Mostly the Palms triumphs by offering the
most intriguing and diverse options for how to sit and relax. There
are double-size bed-like lounge chairs, hammocks, tables and seats
built into the shallow end of the pool, purple mattresses on a sandy
beach and taupe canvas canopies. Even the normal lounge chairs have
better vinyl cushioning than those at most other hotels.</TE>
<TE>   They pay homage to that Vegas classic, the Glass Pool Inn, with a
3 1/2-foot-deep above-ground glass pool with windows in the side for
taking funny pictures of friends underwater. The aim is clearly to
attract a young, happening crowd, in part by calling the pool part of
the hotel the Skin Pool, with a bikini top as a logo. You can even
rent backgammon sets for $10 a day or shoot a round of pool on the
deck.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Very cool. Add a waterfall somewhere and this would
be an A+."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 10. But lounging in a hammock has its appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $6</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bellagio: A-</TE>
<TE>   The scene: Elegance is the calling card of the MGM Mirage's most
upscale destination, and the pool area does not disappoint. Several
pools flank a lovely central walkway of ivy-covered arches, and each
pool is surrounded by tall, well-groomed pines and bonsais. Three of
the pools have mushroom-like fountains in the center for guests to
sit under, proving that you can be classy and fun at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   An extra perk: Free water aerobics classes at noon for guests. Our
most significant concern, though, was that the water had a strangely
unpleasant salty taste found at only one or two other pools in our
survey.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Pretty, but the hot tubs aren't very warm or bubbly."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 7. Nice to cool off, but not much more to do in the
water than that.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $3</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $6.50</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MGM Grand: A-</TE>
<TE>   The scene: The city's largest hotel had to have a big water
feature if only to accommodate its capacity of 10,000 guests. It does
so with four pools sporting clever show-biz names like Talent Pool,
and it goes the extra mile with a lengthy, lazy river that takes
almost 10 minutes to float around. It was, however, oppressively
crowded and noisy.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "The lazy river just goes on and on. This rocks."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 8.5. There's a long rectangular pool with lanes for
folks who want a no-gimmicks place to do laps.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $3</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $4.50</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four Seasons: B+</TE>
<TE>   The scene: The first thing we saw were pool attendants spraying
cans of mist on women in lounge chairs as they relaxed around an
earthworm-shaped pool. This hangout for the ultra-rich won't appeal
to children, but it's not supposed to. It's intended to be a relaxing
respite for wealthy travelers, and it does that especially well,
considering that it borders Mandalay Bay's frenetic beach. Somehow,
despite this, there's little noise.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Boring, but the water was nice."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 5. This place is for luxuriating.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $3.75</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $7</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rio: B+</TE>
<TE>   The scene: A very clever and elaborate effort. Four pools span a
huge area, each with distinctive features. One is shaped like a clam
and has a large concrete shell in the middle with a giant pearl at
its center that spews water. Another is shaped like a fish and has
orange and black tiling on its floor. The third has a Jacuzzi tucked
behind a waterfall, a clever touch. The fourth has a sandy beach that
leads to a deeper, sandless area, accented by a striking waterfall.
The beach was an interesting try, but because the Rio uses coarse
sand, it's uncomfortable to walk on and makes the pool dirty. The
deep end is deeper, at 5 feet, than the Strip standard. One cool
feature was the blackjack table under a canopy in the center.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "They need softer sand in the beach-pool thing, but
that hot tub behind the waterfall was pretty cool."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 9. Deciding which part to swim in is the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.50</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $5.25</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Treasure Island: B+</TE>
<TE>   The scene: This small, compact, lively pool area had one feature
that pushed its grade higher, a slide. Its pitch is only about 10
degrees, but it is also the only hotel, aside from the Flamingo, to
have one. The lifeguards were a bit bossy, but this was a welcome
change from the disengaged ones at the other pools. The faux
wood-plank look of the deck fit the hotel's pirate-ship theme.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Go on the slide headfirst for best effect."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 10. Too frenetic to do anything else, least of all
relax.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.50</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $5</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tropicana: B+</TE>
<TE>   The scene: A terrific surprise from one of the oldest and
least-noticed resorts located at a prominent corner, the Strip and
Tropicana Boulevard. The Tropicana has a large pool with curves and
caverns, which is topped off by a fountain cascading dramatically
from 15 feet above. There's a bar in the pool with swim-up blackjack
tables. The landscaping is great too, with many palms and other trees
that fit the jungle theme. The downside of that, though, is lots of
tree bits in the water, especially in the unappealing hot tub. A
plus: The pool is 5 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "That waterfall is the best!"</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 10. All the action's in the pool, from socializing
to gambling.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.50</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $4.50</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Caesars Palace: B</TE>
<TE>   The scene: Lifeguards at the Luxor and MGM Grand said Caesars' was
their favorite pool on the Strip. But once we saw it, we could only
figure they liked the prospect of glimpsing topless women. This is
the only Strip hotel we found that allows what they call
"European-style topless sunbathing" at the appropriately named Venus
pool. Fortunately, that area is blocked from children's view. The
central pool, with a soaring rotunda in its center and fountains
shooting water 15 feet high, is a sight to behold and frolic beneath.
And there's something to be said for the elegance of the marble
designs in the pool floor. Still, that's all there was. The water was
uncomfortably cold, and the deck is made of some material that gets
so hot that walking barefoot is almost dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "It's nice, but not really that great."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 6. It was really chilly.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.25</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $5.50</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Luxor: B-</TE>
<TE>   The scene: It has a cool layout of four pools at the base of the
pyramid, one of which has 20-foot Egyptian pillars topped by busts of
goats that spit water from their mouths. The other three pools
surround a central structure that should have been a waterfall that
spills out into each. But the waterfall is in disrepair, and instead
swimmers look at a puzzling dry ramp of cracked blue tiles.
Lifeguards looked bitterly bored: One dozed, and another wasn't even
wearing a swimsuit. Fix the decrepit fountain and the lifeguards'
attitudes and the hotel could easily earn a B+ for variety and
excellent use of its theme.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Is that bird poop on the broken waterfall?"</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 6. The pool with the pillars was fun, but visions of
avian feces at the other ones were a turnoff.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $4.25</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paris: B-</TE>
<TE>   The scene: This underwhelming and ordinary spread on a third-floor
deck is nevertheless fun because of the scenery. A leg of the Eiffel
Tower juts into the side of the plaza, and visitors can walk beneath
it after a dunk in the star-shaped pool to grab a bite from the snack
bar.</TE>
<TE>   Another touch befitting the theme was the quaint open-air Parisian
cafe on the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Cool scenery, cold water."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 5. They had to try hard to be this frigid in
110-degree weather.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.50</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $4.25</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orleans: C+</TE>
<TE>   The scene: This ordinary pool hardly reflects the resort's theme,
but it has a spacious tranquillity and a cute baby pool. Mostly, it's
average. We gave Orleans an extra half-grade for its terrific hot
tub, which is circular, with a big palm tree in the center, with
fountains and strong jets.</TE>
<TE>   Capriciously, we awarded another half-grade for the sound system's
Paul Simon music.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "For another half-grade, play some Eminem."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 7. The rare Vegas pool where you can swim laps, and
it's never crowded.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.50</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $3</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Excalibur: C</TE>
<TE>   The scene: For a resort that prides itself on being kid-friendly,
it's peculiar that the only interesting water feature--a small
waterfall--is accompanied by a do-not-touch sign. The mushroom-shaped
pool is surrounded by some theme-appropriate and cute castle facades
on the terrace. The water was too cold.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Why can't we touch the waterfall?"</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 5. A take-it-or-leave-it place.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.25</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $3.75</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Harrah's Las Vegas: C</TE>
<TE>   The scene: This rectangular pool on a second-floor deck is
average. With the building's motel-like facade towering over it and
no view of the Strip, you could just as well be at a Days Inn in
Boise, Idaho. One oddity was that the walls and floor of the pool are
made of metal: Bounce on the floor and you'll feel vibrations. Two
nice features included a chair massage for a reasonable $20 for 15
minutes, and misters that effectively distributed cool puffs of
moisture on nearby loungers.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "I liked the paintings of the parrots, but why are
they there?"</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 7. Decent for swimming laps because it's
rectangular.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.50</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $5</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stratosphere: C</TE>
<TE>   The scene: As with everything else at this hotel, the view's the
thing. In this case, it's not much: From the eighth-floor deck you
look at the smog-shrouded mountains to the west or the Sahara's neon
billboard to the south. Oddly, to the east is a mural of a beach and
sky that's out of place and cheesy. The pool is adequate, although it
had the worst-tasting water. The basketball nets and blue-and-white
balls in the pool were a cool feature, unless you're the guy sitting
behind the nets who has to kick missed shots back into the water
every few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   In its water feature the Stratosphere fails to take advantage of
its status as the tallest structure west of the Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Pool basketball is a fun idea."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 4. Something's not right with that water.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.29</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $3</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Monte Carlo: D+</TE>
<TE>   The scene: Much like its cousin at New York New York, this pool is
small and ugly, although it does shake mildly as a wave pool and
there's a short, lazy river too. This was the only Strip pool we saw
that allowed non-guests in for a fee--a laughable $15 per person. The
Monte Carlo tried to enhance its pool's allure by calling it the
Monte Carlo Beach Club, but it's still merely a hole with water in
it.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Can we go now?"</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 4. Yawn.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Pepsi: $2.75</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Pepsi: $5.50</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aladdin: D</TE>
<TE>   The scene: You know you're in trouble when you get off the
elevator on the sixth floor and walk out to the pool area only to
have your sidekick ask, "Where's the pool?" The dominant element here
is a concrete plain with lounge chairs and tables and two small,
unremarkable pools on raised landings. I could put a lounge chair on
my driveway for the same effect. The zigzag-shaped pools are poorly
conceived as well, with room for only one row of chairs crammed next
to one another. Annoyed guests stood around as if waiting for someone
to vacate a parking space.</TE>
<TE>   We expect more from a new hotel. The water feature here was
clearly an afterthought.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "This is stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 2. Too crowded. Miserable.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $5</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York New York: D</TE>
<TE>   The scene: Whoever decided to place this skimpy pool directly
below the peak of the roller coaster deserves to be fired. Imagine
spending $150 a night to sit poolside and listen to the thunderous
racket of the cars rising to their crescendo followed by the charming
screams of riders as they plummet--every 2 1/2 minutes. The view,
too, is miserable: the parking garage and a sign for Interstate 15.
An occasionally erected volleyball net in the middle would have been
a nice touch if it didn't inconveniently split the pool in two. Also,
because of too much chlorine in the pool, it was uncomfortable to
open our eyes underwater.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that saved this place from an F was the fact that
the Venetian was so disappointing that it deserved to be alone in
that distinction.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Boring, but the hot tub was hot and bubbly."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 2. Not worth going blind for--maybe they should put
a little water in the chlorine.</TE>
<TE>   Price of a Coke: $2.25</TE>
<TE>   Price of a rum and Coke: $4.75</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Venetian: F</TE>
<TE>   The scene: You would think that a resort based on a city of canals
would offer a second-to-none water feature. You would be so, so
wrong. Our venom for this particular pool arises from the shock that
this $1.5-billion casino, which in so many other ways is
sensational--elaborate paintings, enormous and elegant suites and
innovative gondola rides--would offer a pool area that's not only
unimpressive but also downright hideous.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the two pools is a game of wandering through a confusing
maze of planters and walkways. Once you do make it through, you find
two ordinary pools in a big, shadeless expanse. There's no view to
speak of, except of the mustard walls, and even there is evidence of
neglect: Black streaks are emerging on the paint.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, this is one of the newest properties on the Strip, and
its pool area is a great big failure.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie says: "Do we have to actually go in the water to rate this
one?"</TE>
<TE>   Swimmability: 2. Not much else to do. The good news is that if you
stay here, you probably don't know what you're missing at the other
hotels anyway.</TE>

<HD>Glass Pool Inn: Honorary A+</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Friess</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five decades ago, the Las Vegas Strip was nothing but a dusty desert
highway from Los Angeles to what is now the downtown cluster of
casinos. Back then, tourists would drive without air-conditioning
from California and know they were almost in Vegas when they spotted
the Glass Pool Inn, standing alone and beckoning the road to give it
her tired, her hungry and her sweat-drenched masses.</LD>
<LD>   The Glass Pool, which turns 50 this year, was the original Las
Vegas "water feature": a stunning 9-foot-deep above-ground tank with
huge round windows to peer through and take funny photos of friends.
As the city grew up around it, the pool remained a constant relic of
the old days and a frequent draw for filmmakers parading scantily
clad women around a vintage Vegas image. It was originally named the
Mirage, which this kidney-shaped, 54,000-gallon tub must have
appeared to be to those road-weary visitors. But Vegas entrepreneur
Steve Wynn bought the name from then-owner Allen Rosoff in 1988 to
use for his new hotel and company.</LD>
<LD>   Today it's endangered. Rosoff sold it in 2000 to New World, a
partnership of Las Vegas land developers that has purchased 77 acres
east of the Mandalay Bay resort for a new hotel. Earlier press
reports said the Glass Pool would be preserved within the new hotel.
The New World did not return calls for comment.</LD>
<TE>   For now, though, it remains in its iconic location. Most guests
are foreigners sensible enough to realize that they can spend just
$45 a night to stay on the Strip. Non-guests can swim there by paying
$5 per person.</TE>
<TE>   The pool once had a diving board and a slide, but they have been
removed. Although the water is clear and refreshing, the edges are so
grimy that a popular pastime is scratching one's name in the black
residue. The restaurant closed and is now a sign shop. And the deck
has just a few plastic lounge chairs.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't sound like an A+? Ah, but all this fits the Glass Pool
Inn's theme as surely as the Coney Island roller coaster that loops
around New York New York. That theme? Classic Vegas. In a town where
nothing lasts and where everybody's trying to transport guests to
some phony European scene, this one's authentic in its own strange
way.</TE>

<LD>A little action, a lot of talk--that's pretty much the shape of TV
syndication this fall. Game shows will continue play.</LD>
<LD>   "Caroline Rhea": The tart-tongued former "Sabrina, the Teenage
Witch" star takes over the reins from Rosie O'Donnell in a revamped
version of the celebrity chat show. (Premiered Sept. 2)</LD>

<TE>   "Starhunter": Set in the year 2275, the science-fiction hour stars
Michael Pare ("The Virgin Suicides," "Streets of Fire") as a
space-faring bounty hunter seeking fugitives and his kidnapped son.

<TE>   "She Spies": Given a sneak-peek run on NBC's summer schedule, the
action-adventure-comedy hour, starring Natasha Henstridge as the

<LD>The fall schedule of jazz and world music is a virtual banquet table
overflowing with diverse opportunities for musical grazing.</LD>
<LD>   Start with jazz at the Southland's numerous major arts venues:
UCLA Performing Arts' rediscovery of America's greatest musical
achievement has resulted in a number of stellar Royce Hall events,
including the West Coast debut of bassist Dave Holland's big band
(Oct. 3) and a relatively rare appearance by the Pat Metheny Group
(Nov. 16).</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine's Smothers Theatre, a dependable location for
straight-ahead jazz, offers the Manhattan Transfer (Oct. 10; also at
the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts on Oct. 11) and singer
Jane Monheit (Oct. 25).</LD>
<TE>   Cerritos, also a prime source of mainstream jazz, features a
particularly attractive pairing of the Ahmad Jamal Quartet and the
Jim Hall/Charlie Haden Duo (Oct. 19).</TE>
<TE>   The Carpenter Performing Arts Center in Long Beach has also come
up with a first-rate booking in Wayne Shorter's superb new quartet
(Oct. 25).</TE>
<TE>   On the festival front, the two biggest West Coast events take
place in Monterey (Friday through next Sunday) and San Francisco
(Oct. 23-Nov. 10). Among the highlights: Dave Brubeck, Joshua Redman,
Don Byron, Roy Hargrove and the Mingus Big Band during the 45th
Monterey festival; the McCoy Tyner Big Band (Oct. 27), singer
Patricia Barber (Nov. 6) and the Ornette Coleman Trio (Nov. 7) in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, the Verizon Music Festival takes place at venues around
town the first week in October. Of primary interest to jazz fans:
Bela Fleck at UCLA's Royce Hall (Oct. 2), Al Jarreau and Chris Botti
at the Wadsworth Theatre (Oct. 4) and Ray Charles in a free concert
at Pasadena's Central Park (Oct. 6).</TE>
<TE>   Quickly establishing itself as a major player, the Pasadena Jazz
Institute is offering a series of themed programs at Travis
Auditorium. Among the choices: saxophonist Ricky Woodard celebrates
Hank Mobley (Sept. 28), Bill Cunliffe recalls Bud Powell (Oct. 12),
and pianist Christopher Dawson celebrates the late, underappreciated
Sonny Clark (Nov. 9).</TE>
<TE>   In the Southland's major club venues, check out the highly
regarded saxophonist Chris Potter (Sept. 24-29). At Catalina Bar &amp;
Grill: the multitalented George Duke (Sept. 24-29).</TE>
<TE>   The world music scene is also offering a colorful menu. UCLA is
especially active with Israeli singer Chava Alberstein (Oct. 1),
Brazil's Caetano Veloso (Oct. 29-30), Mali's Salif Keita (Nov. 2),
the Afro-Cuban All Stars (Nov. 14) and Cuba's Pablo Milanes (Nov.
21).</TE>
<TE>   On the festival front, the World Festival of Sacred Music
continues through Sept. 29 at venues around town; and the
Yiddishkayt! Festival at the Skirball Cultural Center features "New
Yiddish Songs for the 21st Century" (Oct. 8) and Yiddish soul (Oct.
13).</TE>
<TE>   Standout events also include the U.S. debut performance of "Night
Flight to Rio" by the Orquestra de Sao Paulo and Brazil's top jazz
ensemble, Banda Mantiqueira, at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center's Segerstrom Hall on Oct. 26, and an appearance by legendary
Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar with his sitar-playing
daughter Anoushka at Royce Hall on Sept. 26.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just after a summer that gave us some of the best young bands in
ages, including the White Stripes, the Hives, the Vines and Trail of
the Dead, what's more fitting than a fall highlighted by two of the
'60s forces that inspired them?</LD>
<LD>   The good news isn't just that Bob Dylan, who miraculously has
regained the emotional intensity of his prime, and the Rolling
Stones, who at least still have those classic songs, are coming to
town, but also that they're playing the intimate, 2,400-capacity
Wiltern Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Dylan will reopen the 70-year-old venue, which has been closed for
remodeling, with a three-night stand starting Oct. 15. He accompanied
by one of his best bands ever. Rock's most influential songwriter is
playing with such cocky authority and desire these days that he can
delight you with a song from his last two superb albums, "Time Out of
Mind" and "Love and Theft," or dress up an old favorite in an
imaginative arrangement that may make it hard to recognize for a few
seconds.</LD>
<TE>   The Stones are at the Wiltern for only one night, Nov. 4, but it
too should be special. We can all talk about how these grandfathers
shouldn't still be prancing around the stage, but once you start
hearing the music, the cynicism melts. That's because songs such as
"Tumbling Dice" and "Wild Horses" are still magical, and the band
plays them with conviction and flair.</TE>
<TE>   Also a must at the Wiltern: Ryan Adams, the prolific young
singer-songwriter with influences that range from alt-country to
punk, plays Oct. 23. He's fascinating live. Basically a shy
performer, he needs time on stage to work his way into a comfort
zone, so stick around to the end. At the El Rey earlier this year, he
played 90 minutes or so in workmanlike fashion and then advised
anyone who was tired to go home. Adams and his band then went on for
another hour--and it was brilliant.</TE>
<TE>   Two other key Wiltern shows--Ani DiFranco, who has enough
provocative songs to keep things moving, and Badly Drawn Boy, the
English singer-songwriter whose "About a Boy" is one of the year's
most enchanting collections. They play Oct. 24 and Nov. 8,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere this fall, especially promising nights include Rhett
Miller on Sept. 24 at the Troubadour, Carlos Vives on Sept. 28 at
Universal Amphitheatre, Elvis Costello on Sept. 29 at the Mayan
Theatre and Oct. 1 at the Long Beach Terrace Theatre, Bright Eyes on
Oct. 10-11 at the El Rey Theatre, the Detroit Cobras and the
Dirtbombs on Oct. 10 at Spaceland and Oct. 11 at the Knitting Factory
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Plus Linda Thompson on Oct. 12 at the Troubadour and Oct. 13 at
McCabe's, Spoon on Oct. 23 at the Troubadour, the Rolling Stones on
Oct. 31 at Staples Center and Nov. 2 at Edison International Field in
Anaheim, and the Strokes on Nov. 1-2 at the Greek Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   On the album front, the singer-songwriter brigade will be well
represented. New albums arrive in stores on Sept. 24 from Beck, Ryan
Adams, Peter Gabriel, Rhett Miller, Steve Earle and India.Arie. Two
weeks later, Sinead O'Connor (new arrangements of some old Irish
tunes), Ron Sexsmith and Tom Petty. Badly Drawn Boy and Santana are
due Oct. 22. Johnny Cash and the Wallflowers release albums Nov. 5.</TE>

<LD>The fall art season blasts out of the gate fast this year, with most
of the major museum exhibitions having opened in the past week. A few
smaller but still provocative undertakings will turn up later.</LD>
<LD>   At the J. Paul Getty Museum, "Greuze the Draftsman" (through Dec.
1) assembles 70 drawings from the Louvre, the Hermitage and other
public and private collections internationally for the first such
show devoted to Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805). While not
well-known today, the Frenchman was a favorite of Diderot and other
philosophers of his day, for paintings with distinct moral lessons.
("The Family Bible Reading" wowed 'em at the Paris Salon in 1755.)
His career crashed with the revolution, but in the past few decades a
scholarly cottage industry has gown up around the study of Greuze's
work.</LD>
<LD>   Another 18th century painter, Britain's fashionable portraitist
George Romney (1734-1802), occupies center stage at the Huntington
Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens (today through Dec.
1). Once a rival to Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough for the
favors of London's aristocratic clientele, Romney has long been
eclipsed in reputation by both. The subtitle of the large survey at
the Huntington tells the tale: "British Art's Forgotten Genius."</LD>
<TE>   The liveliest exhibition of the season will likely be "Axis
Mexico: Common Objects and Cosmopolitan Actions," opening this
weekend at the San Diego Museum of Art (through March 9). A survey of
19 artists younger than 45, most of whom work in Mexico City, the
show will juxtapose established mid-career talents such as Silvia
Gruner, Francis Alys and Ruben Ortiz Torres with notable emerging
artists, including Eduardo Abaroa, Daniella Rossell and Santiago
Sierra. Many have shown in Los Angeles during the past decade, but
this is the first overview since "The Perennial Illusion of a
Vulnerable Principle: Another Mexican Art" shook things up at Art
Center College of Design in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The Museum of Contemporary Art offers a 25-year survey of German
artist Thomas Struth, who studied in Dusseldorf with the hugely
influential Gerhard Richter and Bernd and Hilla Becher (today through
Jan 5). Struth catalogs people and places in large-format photographs
that self-consciously call attention to the activity of viewing
images--a distinctly modern phenomenon that culminates in his
striking series of people in museums looking at art.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the photography scene: a survey at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art (Thursday-Jan. 5) of local artist and teacher Donald
Blumberg, who first attracted attention as a street photographer in
the 1960s. The new Pasadena Museum of California Art presents a
traveling show of greatest hits: "Capturing Light: Masterpieces of
California Photography, 1850-2000" (opening Saturday).</TE>
<TE>   Later, three L.A. artists have solo shows: Dave Muller, who
hand-renders drawings of mass-produced art announcements, is at UCLA
Hammer Museum (Oct. 6-Jan. 5); Sam Durant, whose sculptures and
installations put art and pop culture into a conceptual Mixmaster, is
at MOCA (Oct. 13-Jan. 19); and Tom Knechtel, whose paintings are the
elaborate fables of a confirmed sensualist, is at Otis College's Ben
Maltz Gallery (Nov. 9-Feb. 15).</TE>

<LD>An unusually rich sampling of world dance and some highly unusual
reinterpretations of classic scores make the fall full of adventure.</LD>
<LD>   All by itself, the World Festival of Sacred Music offers rarities
galore in its 55 September events--especially, perhaps, the dervish
rituals from Syria, sacred masked dances from Bali and animal dances
from a remote corner of the Pacific called Lifou Island. Spirituality
is integral to these dances, and if you can get beyond limited
notions of dance as entertainment and only that, they may prove a
growth experience.</LD>
<LD>   There's plenty of North American artistry scheduled too, although
some of the local selections seem questionable, if not downright
dubious. Be rigorously selective, lest you fall prey to belly dancers
with delusions of grandeur or delirious touchy-feely indulgences.</LD>
<TE>   Familiar, hyper-professional world dance ensembles this fall
include Africa's Ballet National du Senegal in Santa Barbara and
Malibu in October and the annual visit by Ballet Folklorico de Mexico
de Amalia Hernandez, on view in Escondido and Universal City in
September. Both troupes are reliably impressive--especially on the
viewers' first or second visit--even when they succumb to middlebrow
sampler programming.</TE>
<TE>   For a more enlightened sense of curatorial focus, however, the
world dance company to beat may well be the Southland's own Avaz
International Dance Theatre in a revival of its acclaimed Silk Road
evening, in downtown L.A. in November.</TE>
<TE>   October has the hottest modernism of the year, with the Irvine
Barclay Theatre scoring a double coup: the irrepressible Sean Curran
presenting iconoclastic mixed rep, and Angelin Preljocaj turning "The
Rite of Spring" into an apocalyptic mating dance. At UCLA, the
Cullberg Ballet unleashes its bald, co-ed swan corps in Mats Ek's
radically revised "Swan Lake," and in Santa Barbara, Bill T. Jones
provides another look at the controversial chamber music
choreographies seen in L.A. last season. All four choreographers
approach music in an anything-but-traditional manner, and the results
can be infuriating--or revelatory.</TE>
<TE>   The big discovery of the imported October offerings, however, just
might be Vienna's Willi Dorner Dance Project, coming to the Skirball
Cultural Center with experiments involving high-risk contact
improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   Southland modernism will also be out in force in October, from the
multi-company, pop-flavored Jazz Dance L.A. (at Cal State L.A.), to
the feminist Dance Moving Forward festival (at Highways Performance
Space in Santa Monica) and the balletic La Danserie (at the Madrid
Theatre in Canoga Park).</TE>
<TE>   What's missing through the fall is exciting big ballet: Besides
the undistinguished American Ballet Theatre "Nutcracker" (playing
Hollywood and Costa Mesa in December), there's only the Bolshoi
Ballet in "La Bayadere" (not exactly a company specialty) at the end
of November, plus the season's wild card: Shanghai Ballet dancing
"Coppelia" in a one-night-only visit to Thousand Oaks on Nov. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Safest bet: San Francisco Ballet in an intriguing mixed bill
September in Costa Mesa. (Avoid the company's turgid "Othello" later
in the run.)</TE>

<LD>The most anticipated autumn event in Southern California theater
isn't a particular play; it's the unveiling of the new South Coast
Repertory campus in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Opening Nov. 8 will be the 336-seat Julianne Argyros Stage, with a
traditional proscenium, a balcony and boxes, a back row only 39 feet
from the stage and Richard Greenberg's new "The Violet Hour."</LD>
<LD>   The company's other two theaters have been refurbished. The
507-seat main stage, now called Segerstrom Stage, will have a more
flexible stage apron--rounded off for the opening "Major
Barbara"--and a brighter interior look. The former second stage, now
Nicholas Studio, will have 95 seats, all facing the stage from one
side instead of three sides as before. Maybe all the changes will
place South Coast Rep on the radar of more people.</LD>
<TE>   The pre-Broadway tryout of "Imaginary Friends," opening at San
Diego's Old Globe Theatre on Sept. 29, is the fall's showiest item,
just on the basis of the names associated with it: subjects Lillian
Hellman and Mary McCarthy, stars Swoosie Kurtz, Cherry Jones and
Harry Groener, writer Nora Ephron, composer Marvin Hamlisch, lyricist
Craig Carnelia and director Jack O'Brien.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the looming question at the Mark Taper Forum is
whether the big theater on the hill can succeed in taking over the
sign language-enriched "Big River" from the little theater in the
Valley, Deaf West. Opening on Nov. 14, "Big River" will be the first
Taper production imported from the teeming ranks of L.A.'s
sub-100-seat theaters. But first up, on Thursday, is "Nickel and
Dimed," a look at America's minimum-wage culture, adapted from
Barbara Ehrenreich's book by Joan Holden of San Francisco Mime Troupe
fame.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Gien's "The Syringa Tree," set in '60s South Africa, began
in an L.A. class but sought fame elsewhere, winning an Obie. It's
finally back, at the Pasadena Playhouse, opening Nov. 3. Angeleno
Debbie Allen brings her "Pearl," which also premiered elsewhere, to
Westwood's Geffen Playhouse Nov. 20.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's International Theatre Festival is one of the most
exciting-sounding theatrical gatherings in L.A. in years. But
everything in it is imported.</TE>
<TE>   On the home front, however, Oct. 12 is opening night for two
intriguing plays in L.A.'s sub-100-seat world.</TE>
<TE>   At L.A.'s Evidence Room: "Hot Property," the first new full-length
comedy by '90s L.A. chronicler Justin Tanner since 1998. It's about
the schisms that occur when one member of a group of friends becomes
a star.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Oct. 12, at Venice's Pacific Resident Theatre: the L.A.
premiere of "Big Love," Charles Mee's adaptation of Aeschylus' "The
Suppliant Women." Mee is best known in L.A. for the much-lauded "The
Berlin Circle" at the Evidence Room, but it's his current romantic
comedy, "Wintertime," at La Jolla Playhouse that makes me hungry for
"Big Love."</TE>
<TE>   A week later, the Colony Theatre opens "Bea[u]tiful in the
Extreme" by Leon Martell--the first world premiere at the Colony's
276-seat theater in Burbank. It's a kick to see the new and bigger
Colony's subscription season venturing into the work of a local
playwright, and into a subject--Lewis and Clark--that's almost as
unexplored in the theater as the Louisiana Purchase was in 1803.</TE>

<HD>We Finally Get the 'Pasion' That Created a Sensation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two summers ago in Stuttgart, a serious German audience at the Bach
Academy sat in stony silence through the premiere of a passion based
on the Gospel according to St. Mark. It was composed by an Argentine
Jew, and it included a small encyclopedia's worth of infectious
dance-based Latin American musical styles. What was the crowd
thinking? Was it shocked? Outraged?</LD>
<LD>   There was no way to know until the end when the audience finally
erupted with a joyous, volcanic half-hour ovation rare for a new
classical work just about anywhere. It was no fluke.</LD>
<LD>   Osvaldo Golijov's "La Pasion Segun San Marcos"  created another
sensation at its American premiere by the Boston Symphony last season
and again at its repeat at Tanglewood this summer. Now "San Marcos"
is coming to a theater near you. The Eclectic Orange Festival snagged
the West Coast premiere for the Orange County Performing Arts Center
on Oct. 18.</LD>
<TE>   As excellent preparation for the event, on Oct. 15, at the Irvine
Barclay Theatre, Eclectic Orange will introduce Golijov--the Los
Angeles Philharmonic's composer-in-residence last season--to Orange
County in the Kronos String Quartet's program of music from its
sensational Mexican-themed CD "Nuevo." Several of the arrangements
are by Golijov.</TE>
<TE>   Shostakovich, whose music seemed just about everywhere in the
Southland last season, is back as well. On Oct. 16, the Philharmonic
continues its Shostakovich symphony cycle with Esa-Pekka Salonen
conducting the Sixth. The following week, Los Angeles Opera imports
the composer's Stalin-offending "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" from the
Kirov, as its replacement for "War and Peace," which the company
canceled. Each of these Shostakovich works alone would be noteworthy.
Together, they present a window on the artist as a victim of
political intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   It would be nice to say that Robert Wilson is also back. In a
sense he is, given that the peripatetic American director has been to
Los Angeles before. But the West Coast still remains one of the few
places in the civilized world that has not seen any of his major
work. Worse, L.A. is the city where he has suffered his greatest
failures--the inability to raise funds for the grandly ambitious
"CIVIL warS" project for the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival and the
disappointing 3-D "Monsters of Grace" at UCLA three years ago. That
should all change when UCLA Live presents "Woyzeck" at the Freud
Playhouse on Dec. 3. This will be an entirely different take on the
play by Georg Buchner, upon which Berg based his opera "Wozzeck."</TE>
<TE>   The Wilson version, with songs by Tom Waits, promises Wilson's
stunning imagery and lighting along with a sample of his taste for
the bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   Here are two soloists to put on your list. Mezzo-soprano Lorraine
Hunt Lieberson, as dramatically compelling as any singer before the
public today, offers a rare recital Oct. 9 at UCLA's Royce Hall.
French pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, last heard in Los Angeles
playing Ligeti with startling virtuosity, has lately turned his
illuminating style to Beethoven. He performs the "Emperor" Concerto
with Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Dec. 12, 14
and 15.</TE>

decision to overturn a jury verdict against the investment firm of

<HD>Angel Fans Should Rejoice</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's September, and Angels fans with long memories are wondering
whether their team will finally outrun the "Curse of the Singing
Cowboy" and make it into postseason play for the first time since
1986. It's a nervous time, but a far better way to spend the waning
days of summer than trying to digest a second-place finish during a
strike-shortened season.</LD>
<LD>   It's good that baseball's brains and brawn managed to walk out of
a back room with a labor agreement instead of using the assembled
klieg lights to spark a strike or lockout. But coming to grips with
the salary cap and luxury tax is akin to bunting late in the game
with the home team down by many runs.</LD>
<LD>   Anaheim fans littered the field with baseballs, toilet paper and
curses on Aug. 30, the night before the strike deadline that,
thankfully, passed without incident. And, despite the Angels' high
caliber of play this season, going into last week's series with the
first-place Oakland Athletics, the team had sold out Edison
International Field less than a dozen times. So it's clear that when
it comes to fan loyalty, owners and players had best start swinging
for the fences.</LD>
<TE>   Let's start with the players. The Angels have had their share of
athletes--Mo Vaughn comes to mind--who seem content to travel from
franchise to franchise dragging along increasingly large sacks of
money. Owners also have their work cut out. Fans had high hopes when
the Walt Disney Co. bought into the team in 1996. But the media
giant's only postseason play has been with "Angels in the Outfield,"
a movie featuring an angel who leads the hard-luck team to a pennant.</TE>
<TE>   More than any other sport, baseball depends upon one generation
passing along a love of the game to the next. It takes time and a
patient tutor to explain the infield fly rule, the mechanics of a
balk and the difference between a slider and a curve. A generation
ago, Angels fans used the off-season to talk trades; now, they have
their pick of Lakers and Clippers games, college football and
professional hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Younger consumers are at the heart of Disney's entertainment
empire. But many youngsters won't sit still for games that drag on
for more than three hours. A generation raised on "SportsCenter" and
GameBoy understandably prefers to catch its sports on the fly.</TE>
<TE>   But it is September and the Angels are solid contenders for a
wild-card berth, if not a division championship. There's even an
outside chance that October could bring a Freeway Series. For
baseball fans, that's about as good as it gets.</TE>

<LD>Re "Discouraged Voters Will Stay Away From the Polls," Sept. 3:</LD>
<LD>   Several letters to The Times commended voters who are voicing
their complaints about flaws in our governmental system by no longer
going to the polls. Most disturbing of these letters was from Anthony
R. Fellow, a professor of media and politics at Cal State Fullerton.
He writes, "Politicians need to give voters more credit for no longer
going to the polls."</LD>
<LD>   Fellow gave a long list of grievances with our political system,
but he applauds the most serious grievance that the democratic
governments face: voter apathy.</LD>

<LD>Re "Proposition 50 Is Good for Beaches, Wetlands," Aug. 18:</LD>
<LD>   A letter from the head of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust attempts to
screen out the obvious facts as reported by The Times on Aug. 4, that
money from Prop. 50 will be spent to acquire land from major
corporations which, in return, will realize windfall profits on the
sale of troublesome holdings. He states that the Yes on 50 campaign
"welcomes any organization or developer to join in seeing that
Proposition 50 is voted into law by the citizens of California." Of
course they do--without the more than $1 million put up so far by
theses same interests just to gather signatures, the rip-off would
never had made it to the printer.</LD>
<LD>   Landowners have a perfect right to make huge contributions to a
measure that, if passed, will result in a quantum boost to their
corporate coffers. One of the problems is that these same millions in
campaign donations will be spent in trying to fool the voter that the
proposition is about Clean Water. I doubt that California voters want
to have the state's general fund raided for these bailouts.</LD>

<LD>Re "Schoolwork in the Balance," Sept. 8:</LD>
<LD>   I was struck by the arrogance of a teacher who believes that what
she has to offer is paramount in a child's education. During my
43-year tenure as a public school teacher, when parents took children
out of school for an extended vacation, I always adopted the view,
"Don't let school stand in the way of an education."</LD>
<LD>   Often the vacation involved visiting a historic place in a foreign
land that could only serve to enhance a background for a developing
student. Generally the children who were taken out of school were
from homes where the welfare of the child was extremely important to
the parents. I am not minimizing the importance of a well-planned
unit of study with clearly defined objectives. However, just as the
teacher's student has forgotten his experience at the United Nations
building, I would guess there are other students who have forgotten
many of the units that the teacher so carefully prepared. As
teachers, it is extremely important that we bring the world to our
students' experience, but when the students are going to the world,
we as teachers should not stand in their way.</LD>

<TE>   Elizabeth Triana's commentary on kids missing school really hit
home with me. As a teacher I, too, have seen students who miss many
school days. One student last year missed 56 out of 180 days. She and
her parents were referred to the Student Attendance Review Board. Her
parents did not show up for the scheduled meeting.</TE>
<TE>   When students do not come to school, not only do they miss out on
important learning opportunities; the school loses money. Schools
receive money from the state based on student attendance. Lost money
means fewer supplies, books and other materials.</TE>
<TE>   Currently there is no consequence for parents who keep their kids
out of school. I propose that these parents be billed for days their
students are not in school and not out sick.</TE>
<TE>   We are under constant pressure to raise student achievement. It is
very difficult to raise the achievement of a child who is not in
school regularly.</TE>

<LD>Re "Panel Postpones Marblehead Hearing," Sept. 6:</LD>
<LD>   It is fair to say that, with the exception of some City Council
members, most San Clemente citizens were delighted to see the Lusk
Co. withdraw its plans for the development of Marblehead. I have a
suggestion to help them solve the impasse: Turn the area over to the
city for a public park and call it Lusk Park. This move will: 1) Cure
them permanently of a huge headache; 2) Immortalize the Lusk name; 3)
Produce a huge tax write-off that will probably offset all those
lousy millions they were hoping to make; and 4) Make 50,000 citizens
of San Clemente (who do not have a park) deliriously happy and
forever grateful.</LD>

<LD>Re "Court Tosses Race-Based School Policy," Aug. 30:</LD>
<LD>   The Huntington Beach Union High School District should quit
worrying about racial transfer quotas for students and see that
resources, particularly experienced, capable teachers, are assigned
to schools with large numbers of ethnic-minority students. To
overcome the resistance of teachers and their unions to assignment
based on need rather than on seniority, the Huntington Beach system
could offer a premium salary to their best teachers to work in these
schools. Such a policy would produce far better results than the
inclusion of certain percentage of white students. Incidentally, it
might solve their problem by eliminating the desire of white students
to transfer.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush Court Nominee Is Voted Down," Sept. 6:</LD>
<LD>   I was extremely disappointed by the party-line votes cast in the
Senate Judiciary Committee regarding nomination of Judge Priscilla
Owen to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Democrats repeatedly
claimed she was "outside the mainstream" when the facts prove
otherwise. Voters elected her to the Texas Supreme Court by an 83%
majority and Owen recently received the gold standard seal of
approval from the American Bar Assn., the endorsement of 23 major
newspapers and the support of Texas' two senators.</LD>
<LD>   The 10 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee prevented her
nomination from moving to the full Senate where duly-elected
representatives from throughout the country could cast their vote and
weigh in on their beliefs regarding her being "out of the
mainstream." Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee were
apparently afraid the full Senate would fail to agree with their
viewpoint.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) commented that her vote was also
intended to send a message to the White House regarding the type of
candidates Bush should nominate, given his margin of victory in the
last election. The Constitution gives the president the authority to
nominate whomever he wishes, independent of margin of victory.
Confirmation of judicial nominees should be measured by the Senate as
a whole, not a select minority of 10 senators. Perhaps it is not Owen
who is "out of the mainstream," but rather the 10 Democrats on the
Senate Judiciary Committee.</TE>

<LD>Re "Dual-Language Classes Train for Diversity," Sept. 3:</LD>
<LD>   District officials at Santa Ana say that the Jefferson and Martin
Luther King Jr. schools have proved successful. Looking at the
Stanford 9 scores, I see that Jefferson has 62% of its fifth-grade
students below the 50th percentile, and Martin has 87% of its
students below the 50th percentile.</LD>
<LD>   That is hardly successful.</LD>
<TE>   About seven years ago, Davis Elementary chose to be a
dual-immersion school. Davis talked of the same incremental
Spanish/English throughout the grade levels. The 2002 Stanford 9
scores showed that 87% of the fifth-grade class is below the 50th
percentile.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking mostly Spanish to kids already versed in the language is
bilingual education by another name. How are they going to learn to
read and speak English if all they hear is mostly Spanish, day and
night?</TE>
<TE>   Michael Charles</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The author of the story on Spanish immersion classes seemed
unaware of Las Palmas Elementary School in San Clemente, which has
had the program for some time. I have two grandchildren there who are
progressing beautifully. They are in first and third grades, and we
all appreciate the way the teachers and the staff approach this
important method of learning both Spanish and English. Parents drive
many miles so their children can be involved with this excellent
bilingual learning program.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Simpson</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was ironic to note that Proposition 227, the "English only"
initiative passed by voters four years ago, has been circumvented
with the tactic of dual-language immersion in Santa Ana. This end-run
around the law is promoted by activist Nativo Lopez. Latino parents,
wanting English instruction, are demanding his recall from the school
board. Lopez denies that this is his tactic. But if it walks like a
duck and quacks like a duck, chances are that it is a duck.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are changing demographically," stated one apologist for
the bilingual program. No doubt about that. Thirty years ago, the
Santa Ana Unified School District was 92% Anglo. Today it is 92%
Hispanic. But the argument for "dual-language" instruction for living
in a "diverse community" is a specious one. Santa Ana is not a
diverse American community. It is a Mexican colony, plain and simple.</TE>

<HD>Buying Express Lanes: Good Deal or Bailout?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Map for 91 Express Lanes," commentary, Sept. 1:</LD>
<LD>   I support John M.W. Moorlach's appraisal of evaluating the
possibility of the Transportation Corridor Agencies buying the 91
Express Lanes from the California Private Transportation Co. As a
former board member of the TCA, I believe Moorlach's analysis about
the proposed purchase of the struggling operation is outstanding.
This is especially true considering that toll roads are a relatively
new phenomenon in Southern California and usually run into start-up
difficulties. The TCA's learning curve is far more developed than
that of the OCTA in regard to running, managing and marketing a toll
road.</LD>
<LD>   One additional suggestion for the near term, having just driven
through bumper-to-bumper traffic on the Riverside Freeway again a few
days ago, is to capture the cash customers who are frustrated by
their daily commute but are not yet willing to commit to the monthly
cost or luxury of a transponder. Capturing the part-time users would
help increase revenue.</LD>

<TE>   Re "91 Toll-Lane Deal Passes, Goes to Davis," Sept. 1:</TE>
<TE>   Your recent article about AB 1010, which allows the Orange County
Transportation Authority to acquire the franchise agreement for the
91 Express Lanes from the private franchise, failed to include me
among the Orange County Assembly members who supported or abstained
from the bill.</TE>
<TE>   I represent northern Orange County, and the horrible congestion
that exists on the Riverside Freeway directly affects my
constituents. Not only did I vote in favor of AB 1010, but I also
co-wrote the measure with Assemblyman Lou Correa. AB 1010 is the
culmination of work I began last year with another bill, AB 1346, to
accelerate freeway improvements and provide long-overdue relief to
drivers on one of the most congested commuter routes in the nation.</TE>

<TE>   The 91 Express Lanes purchase smells like a huge taxpayer bailout
of a failed toll road business. What is next, a taxpayer bailout of
the Transportation Corridor Agencies? Moorlach's suggestion that the
failed 91 Express Lanes should be managed by the failed TCA is
surprising and scary. In fact, are they not failing themselves? One
just got junk bond ratings. Wall Street knows that the toll roads do
not work.</TE>
<TE>   This action is supported by Todd Spitzer, chairman of OCTA, which
will take control of the 91 Express Lanes, and a board member of both
of the failing Transportation Corridor Agencies. This worries me, and
sets a precedent for government agencies to buy failed toll roads in
Orange County and still does not address the real issue.</TE>
<TE>   The real issue is bad urban planning. The solution to traffic is
not a $500-million taxpayer bailout of a failed toll road. It is
better planning by our politicians and their appointees. You cannot
build your way out of traffic. Riverside politicians have once again
failed to address the issue of balancing jobs and housing. Large
housing developments do not happen in isolation. Proper urban
planning requires such things as schools, stores, parks, some
wilderness and, of course, local job opportunities. One would think
that Riverside politicians would be able to attract businesses to
support the large labor force that lives in their community. However,
the Riverside politicians failed to plan for jobs and housing and
have turned to Orange County taxpayers to bail them out.</TE>

<TE>   I'm glad to see that Moorlach has done his job well enough to have
time for interests outside his actual job. Not only can he address
the finances of the 91 Express Lanes purchase project, he is already
telling us what the alternate routes (Lake Mathews tunnel and
Foothill toll road) should be.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, we have another elected official who is clueless about
what is needed but willing to offer his advice on how best to fix the
problem. How refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   Here is the real answer to the problem: reversible lanes. They
have used reversible lanes on the Coronado Bay Bridge with great
effectiveness. Have you ever been to Washington, D.C.? Just as in the
Orange County-Riverside area, the traffic flows into Washington in
the morning and out of Washington in the late afternoon. There, the
reversible lanes are incredibly important to the overall traffic
flows. Why not here?</TE>
<TE>   At a minimal cost, the toll lanes connecting Orange and Riverside
counties could be converted to reversible lanes, thus adding a
minimum of two additional traffic lanes in either direction
immediately. Then again, I don't have the engineering degree that
Moorlach has. I have only common sense.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Craving That 9-Month Break," voices, Aug. 31:</LD>
<LD>   Maybe Robin Schoettler Fox can't come up with ideas for things to
do with kids in August, but, as another mother of three, I cherish
the time when we don't have to take kids to school, attend sporting
events and juggle all the other activities.</LD>
<LD>   The list of cleaning chores Schoettler Fox rattles off take only a
day to do, and we do our back-to-school shopping in a single day as
well (while making it a fun outing with lunch somewhere special).</LD>
<TE>   On the other 29 days of August we visited the library, toured a
fire station, read books in our favorite doughnut shop, played in
local parks, explored museums, hiked around zoos, had adventures at
Disneyland, walked along beaches, saw movies together, and ran out of
free days long before we ran out of ideas of things to do with them.</TE>
<TE>   Our problem is not that August doesn't have enough scheduled
structure; the trouble for us is that more months aren't like August.
Somewhere along the line it became popular to keep kids busier than
the CEOs of most major companies. I don't know if that's because of
the day-care problems encountered when both parents work or because
parents wanted more time to themselves or what. But I wouldn't trade
the downtime I have with my kids for anything in the world, and I
like to think my kids feel that way as well.</TE>

<LD>Re "Could a Freeze Gun Put Flames on Ice?," Sept. 3:</LD>
<LD>   While I am sure the inventors of the firefighting blimp and freeze
gun want to help, I think they need to look into some basics of
wilderness firefighting.</LD>
<LD>   The normal weather conditions that accompany the biggest fires may
prevent the blimps' use. The training that most wilderness
firefighters go through teaches them the basics of fire behavior and
fire attack. The designers would be well served to go through some of
this training so they can better understand the basics. They should
also familiarize themselves with the science behind the amount of
heat released per foot of flame front as it relates to flame lengths
and just how powerful Mother Nature truly is.</LD>
<TE>   Rainstorms help put fires out by saturating fuel in the fires'
path, making them less susceptible to the fire, not by putting
raindrops on flames. As for the freeze gun, make it work, make it
transportable, and make the resources required to use it readily
available and cheap and you might beat class A foam. Class A foam
works and water is generally accessible. In the heat of a major fire
with everything working against you, one principle still holds true:
Keep it simple, stupid.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not raise the public's hope for some great new technology
when you don't understand the basics of the problem you are trying to
fix.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Land of the free and home of the afraid.</LD>
<LD>   When our country initially responded to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, we strongly advocated that the terrorists would win only if
they succeeded in taking away our freedoms, our way of life. While
few would disagree we should institute better (not just more)
security measures, what has transpired is a travesty.</LD>
<LD>   Much has been written about the extreme and ridiculous security
checks, resulting lines, lack of consistency and the billions of
dollars being wasted. As many out-of-touch government figureheads
scramble with their knee-jerk reactions, everything from cockpit
weapons, self-defense courses, air marshals occupying first-class
seats on thousands of flights, and fingerprinting employees to
confiscating safety pins has been debated and/or implemented.</LD>
<TE>   Federal security screeners with a few extra days of training and
their salaries tripled do little except cost millions, waste time and
erode freedoms. One major airline has seen its security costs go from
$8 million to more than $180 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   What America has lost is any balance or common sense. It is not
necessary to give up so much or even spend so many millions for a
safer country. We should do our best within a reasonable and balanced
wisdom and cease allowing any situation to cause us to live in fear
or behind the so-called polls that would have us live in a solitary
box if enough pathetic sheep continue to follow.</TE>

<LD>   To blame a child's death from a gunshot on legal fireworks sales
in Buena Park is foolish. It is even more ridiculous for The Times to
use such a tragedy to once again complain about the availability of
legal fireworks.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of people in Orange County bought and used
state-approved fireworks this Fourth of July with no problems

<TE>   Is it really the job of the government to remove something

much more frightening than anything sold at a California fireworks
stand.</TE>

<LD>Re "Charter School Money," letters, Sept. 6:</LD>
<LD>   In his letter to The Times regarding charter school funding, Alan
Bonsteel, a school voucher advocate, lies about charter school
funding when he says they receive only 60% of what the public schools
receive. He knows better. In fact, many charter schools receive more
funding than public schools because they often receive large gifts
and grants from private foundations. At a minimum they receive the
same amount, dollar for dollar.</LD>
<LD>   This is another feeble attempt to make excuses for the
underwhelming success of some charter schools. Bonsteel's real
concern is that this less-than-stellar report on charter schools
(which he and his colleagues see as "entry level" voucher schools)
will hurt his chances at another attempt to subsidize private schools
for the much less than needy at the expense of California's already
underfunded public schools.</LD>

<KH>ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE</KH>
<HD>Let Experts Spend Park Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Board of Supervisors should reverse its August
decision to have individual supervisors determine how and where to
spend $16 million in state bond measure funding. Supervisors should
rethink their vote and turn the one-time cash infusion over to where
it belongs--the experts at the county harbors, beaches and parks
department.</LD>
<LD>   The funds in question were generated by Proposition 12, a park
bond measure that state voters passed in March 2000. The proposition
is viewed as a lifesaver for local, regional and state parks in
California, where the booming population is putting an increased
strain on parks. Supervisors voted Aug. 20 to split the Proposition
12 funds among their districts instead of accepting a spending plan
submitted by the harbors, beaches and parks staff.</LD>
<LD>   The board decision arguably was driven by a desire to ease the
shortage of park space in North County, an issue that has been
building for decades as South County added larger parks. But, in an
era of increasingly tight budgets, voters need to know that limited
parks funding is being used in the most effective fashion--not being
divvied up to suit the desires of individual elected officials.</LD>
<TE>   Some critics fault the harbors, beaches and parks agency for
suggesting that $8 million of the Proposition 12 money be used for
the mundane but necessary business of improving sewer lines at Irvine
and O'Neill regional parks. Supervisor Chuck Smith, in fact, argued
that voters had approved Proposition 12 to fund safe neighborhood
parks, not "county parks sewer systems."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Proposition 12 clearly allows funds to be used for the
necessary business of managing and maintaining the state's hefty
investment in parks and natural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Proposition 12 campaigned for the ballot measure by
noting that the maintenance backlog for California's local and urban
parks had reached $2.5 billion--and that deferred maintenance and
repair projects at state parks had risen to more than $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Harbors, Beaches and Parks clearly needs the $12 million.</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1996, the county has slashed at least $4 million
from the department's budget to help cover payments on $1.4 billion
in debt that the county assumed in the wake of the painful 1994
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   It's understandable that supervisors want to take care of the
green space in their own backyards. But splitting $16 million into
five funds isn't the right way to address the undeniably complex and
costly business of ensuring that county residents enjoy easy access
to parks.</TE>
<TE>   Parks fall within a supervisor's district because of how
boundaries are drawn. When those districts are redrawn--as they were
last year--parks shift from one district to another, a process that
undermines supervisors' arguments that they're simply looking out for
longtime constituents.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the county operates regional parks that serve
residents in and outside the county. It's wrong to assume that
residents don't use parks outside of their supervisor's district. By
that logic, nobody living north of the Costa Mesa Freeway would ever
use the Great Park.</TE>
<TE>   The harbors, beaches and parks department is responsible for
developing and maintaining county parks. It's not fair to penalize
the department for giving an honest--if not particularly sexy--plan
to use the funds to fix sewer systems. Supervisors should give the
department a much-needed vote of confidence and let the experts
determine how to spend the Proposition 12 funds.</TE>

<LD>Schools wouldn't sell cigarettes on campus to raise money for a
student dance. So it's really about time they followed the lead of
the Capistrano schools and other pioneering districts by getting rid
of soda machines and junk foods.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, we all know that kids, at least the older ones, can readily
get their hands on a Coke as soon as they leave campus. And it's
possible that campuses will make less money for extracurricular
activities by selling bottled water and raisins than sugary sodas and
candy.</LD>
<LD>   Adults feel, with some justification, that children, especially
adolescents, often aren't listening to a thing that authority figures
say. But kids are experts at observing what adults do--and fail to
do. Schools have been spitting forth lessons about health and
nutrition but made it clear that making bucks is more important than
eating right. That's arguably an appropriate philosophy for Pepsi
bottlers; it's not for public school boards, which should make
campuses relative havens from the bombardment of junk culture.</LD>
<TE>   It's embarrassing to recall Laguna Beach's 1998 decision to have
the school lunch menus printed by a marketing company. The full-color
menus showed off two unlikely spokesmen--plain and peanut-butter
M&amp;Ms--who told children, "It's plain nutty if you don't eat healthy."
The schools got 2 cents for each menu that went home with
children--then went back to plain menus the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano officials don't expect funding from food and drink
sales to fall off. At some schools, sales representatives have told
them, vending machines of water and juice have to be replenished more
often than soda machines. Hungry and thirsty children reach for
whatever palatable products are available. True, candy is enough of a
lure to get them to munch something even when they're not hungry, but
surely no adult wants to feed into such an unhealthful eating
pattern, especially given current concerns about teen obesity.</TE>
<TE>   If funding does fall off, it's unconvincing to cry about how
unfair it is to lose money for field trips and dances. Students who
have money to buy soda and other junk foods have a few dollars they
can spend on the student dance. Maybe schools can try starting a
donation box and urge students to plunk their soda money into a fund
that will help pay for field trips and other extracurricular
activities. That way, the entire dollar goes to benefit students,
instead of just the percentage returned by the soda company.</TE>
<TE>   Schools that eschew junk food need to keep an educated eye on
what's meant by "healthful." Some "juice products" are loaded with
sugar; some pure fruit juices carry very little nutrition. Many a
granola bar has been laced with chocolate chips and marshmallows to
the point where no dietitian would consider it a healthful option.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's nice to think that a generation of children could
learn that the appropriate response to thirst is a drink of water.</TE>

<HD>Overturned Death Penalty Angers Juror</HD>
<DH>A religious conversion didn't change the fact that [William
Payton] committed the murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORRAINE RHOADS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why do we have juries? We have them to hear evidence presented by
prosecutors and defense lawyers. Our justice system guarantees that a
person charged with a crime, no matter how heinous, is entitled to a
trial that is heard by a jury of his or her peers.</LD>
<LD>   I was a juror on the William Payton trial ("Death Penalty Is
Overturned in 1980 Murder," Aug. 2). This trial came during
Thanksgiving-Christmas 1982. I was working as an administrative
secretary at a hospital. Another juror was an executive at a bank.
The jury was composed of 12 intelligent people who heard the
evidence, weighed it and came to a just verdict. Payton was
privileged to sit in during juror interviews and the final selection
of the jury of 12. He had a right to object to any of us serving.</LD>
<LD>   I am now more than irate that Payton's death penalty has been
overturned. It has been 20 years--22 since the murder--since we found
him guilty of the heinous murder and rape of Pamela Montgomery.</LD>
<TE>   A religious conversion didn't change the fact that he committed
the murder. Federal public defender Dean R. Gits argued that his
client's constitutional rights were violated because the jury was
told not to consider the fact that he had been "born again."</TE>
<TE>   What about the rights and life of Montgomery when Payton came
after her with a knife to rape her and stab her a dozen times?</TE>
<TE>   Despite the prosecutor's comment that we shouldn't discuss the
religions conversion, we jurors did discuss it. We felt that, coming
two years after the murder, the conversion made no difference.</TE>
<TE>   Payton had fled to another state after the murder and returned
after a year of "meditation." Fortunately, he was arrested when he
returned. And he since has had 20 years to meditate.</TE>
<TE>   We listened to the testimony of all the witnesses, including that
of a jail inmate and a guard who both attested to the good Payton had
been doing while in jail.</TE>
<TE>   I am appalled at the ruling by U.S. District Judge Manuel Real in
Los Angeles, and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision. None of
these judges was on that jury. They didn't hear that Payton had
attacked another woman in a similar manner. They didn't see the
damage done to the face of the woman he attempted to knife after he
had killed Montgomery. And they didn't see the gruesome pictures of
the murdered girl that we, the jury, had to view.</TE>
<TE>   They just came to the conclusion that the religious conversion
should have been considered and somehow absolved him from paying with
his life.</TE>
<TE>   I do hope that Dane Gillette, who heads the California attorney
general's death penalty unit, asks the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse
this decision and reinstate this death penalty verdict.</TE>
<TE>   William Payton deserves to die, born again or not. Pamela
Montgomery didn't have a chance to be born again. And Payton now has
had 20 more years of life than she had.</TE>
<TE>   We need the courts to stop letting murderers and rapists off. The
jury I served on heard the evidence and came to a verdict based on
the evidence. Since then, we've seen appeal after appeal and the
overturning of a just verdict based on a flimsy excuse.</TE>
<TE>   We have the death penalty in this state. Enforce it and maybe
we'll have fewer murders of young women and men as we have been
hearing about the last few months. Judges should give jurors the
courtesy of believing that we consider all of the evidence and reach
just verdicts.</TE>

<HD>Planning Tustin Base's Legacy</HD>
<DH>In planning the transformation of the Marine base, Tustin
was charged with ensuring long-term economic and social benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILLS WORLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than a decade of planning, negotiating and work by dozens
of groups throughout Orange County and the federal government, the
reuse plan for the former Tustin Marine Corps Air Facility is moving
forward.</LD>
<LD>   Navy officials turned over title to much of the base to Tustin
this summer. Ground has been broken for much-needed transitional
homeless facilities.</LD>
<LD>   The Tustin City Council recently selected a developer for the
first phase of housing development.</LD>
<TE>   This project will demonstrate the city's commitment to affordable
housing and help with the jobs-housing balance in Orange County.
Furthermore, plans for an abused-children's facility and a county
regional park are moving ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The city soon will solicit proposals from four developers for a
commercial center. Tustin also has announced the start of a process
to select a master developer for more than 700 acres of the base that
will include homes and a business park.</TE>
<TE>   All the land slated for private development, including the housing
and commercial center sites, will be sold as quickly as possible by
the city.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy, through the General Services Administration, is
accepting bids for 235 acres of base land that won't be conveyed to
the city. Based on the bids received to date, there is tremendous
interest in the Navy property that, under the city's reuse plan, will
be limited to residential uses.</TE>
<TE>   Our sense of community and our vision set us on a path that will
become our legacy for 75 years. That is why the name Tustin Legacy
has been chosen.</TE>
<TE>   As it has been for much of the 75 years since Tustin was
incorporated, the Marine Corps air station will be an essential
element of our future.</TE>
<TE>   Established in 1942, the base was commissioned to support critical
blimp anti-submarine operations protecting the West Coast at the
onset of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   When federal officials decided to close the base in 1991, many
were saddened that the Marines and their families would be moved and
no longer be a part of the Orange County community.</TE>
<TE>   But our community leaders resolved to ensure a legacy that would
bring Orange County together. They envisioned the 1,600-acre base
used for a variety of purposes: housing, jobs, schools, day care,
parks and homeless accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   In planning the transformation of the base, Tustin was charged
with ensuring long-term economic and social benefits. And, through a
long process, the reuse plan was born. There is much more planned
than the projects that have been launched at this early juncture.</TE>
<TE>   In coming years, land at the base will also be developed for
day-care facilities and schools for Tustin Unified, Irvine Unified
and Santa Ana Unified school districts. South Orange County and
Rancho Santiago community college districts also will have space for
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, a third of the base will be dedicated to public uses,
including an 84-acre county regional park. Development will create
more than 24,000 permanent jobs.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that both the Tustin and El Toro base closures were not
without controversy. We chose to resolve our disputes through
negotiations and compromise. For many years, we worked toward a
settlement of a land dispute with Santa Ana Unified School District.
At times, it was a difficult and contentious dispute.</TE>
<TE>   But it is in the spirit of compromise and public service that
everyone came together to settle the dispute in a manner that will
both help alleviate the crowded conditions of Santa Ana Unified
schools and ensure that the base reuse plan that benefits all Orange
County citizens can move forward.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution to this issue was possible only because everyone
came together to work in the best interests of those who desperately
need the programs that will move forward with the base reuse plan.</TE>
<TE>   As redevelopment at the 1,600-acre base begins, we look forward to
the families that will live in the new homes and the children who
will attend the new schools and benefit from the various community
programs. Thousands of jobs will be generated, and every person in
Orange County will benefit from the legacy of the reuse plan for the
former Tustin Marine Corps Air Facility.</TE>

<HD>It Was a Banner Day for Soccer Parents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One soccer mom made a midnight run to Kinko's to get that last team
photo laminated. Another encountered sticky technical difficulties
when her glue gun ran amok on her son's team banner. Feeling pressure
to do good by her daughter's team, one woman sought consultation from
a professional graphic artist before taking scissors to the felt.</LD>
<LD>   For these and other soccer-gripped parents throughout Southern
California, Saturday offered their big chance to show off just how
crafty they can be when it comes to winning one competition that
requires their heavy hand: The Soccer Team Banner Contest.</LD>
<LD>   One first-time soccer dad--a professional animator whose credits
include the films "Hercules" and "Little Mermaid," an artist so
serious that he lives in a downtown L.A. loft--admitted to feeling a
bit humbled early Saturday morning as he surveyed and photographed
the banners on parade before him.</LD>
<TE>   "This all was a new medium for me," said Bruce Morris, 44. "I wish
I had seen examples from last year. I would have done better on color
and legibility."</TE>
<TE>   Morris and others uninitiated in this fall tradition watched in
awe as American Youth Soccer Organization opening day ceremonies
unfolded at South Pasadena High School early Saturday morning. It's
one of dozens that annually take place in September across Southern
California, drawing thousands to local stadiums, a reflection of
youth soccer's surge in popularity.</TE>
<TE>   The morning typically culminates when the uniformed kids--jerseys
all the colors of a 64-Crayola box--parade around the track holding
their banners high.</TE>
<TE>   Although the young players get the cheers, the elaborate banners
draw the oohs and ahs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sensing there is quite a bit of behind-the-scenes competition
going on here," Morris commented as the banners passed, a display of
bold colors, airbrush techniques, glitter and digitally produced
photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Only kids could come up with the crazy team names: Wild Peas,
Thrashing Mooses, Zooming Zebras, Purple Pythons, Blue Unstoppables,
Cotton Candy Kickers.</TE>
<TE>   But only a parent bent on making a child proud could become an
overnight expert on illustration, bringing these bizarre names to
life on a 3-foot-by-5-foot team banner. And only a parent--after
pulling an all-nighter making the banner--could rouse his or her
youngster in time to make the 7:30 a.m. ceremony and banner judging.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they arrived Saturday morning on the high school field,
carrying their banners like some kind of holy vestments, the
centerpiece of excitement for a day that would be hot and hectic with
games, teams photos and packed family schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Quan, mother of six, full-time middle school counselor
and part-time soccer team mom, stands out among veteran banner
makers. Quan has volunteered to make three team banners each of the
past few years, winning at least five first-place awards.</TE>
<TE>   She said completing the banners on time is all about organization.
Quan's strategy is to keep it simple, keep the lines clean and make
sure there is a stark contrast between the letters and the
background.</TE>
<TE>   Quan is particularly proud this year of the She Devil team banner
featuring a 2 1/2-foot-tall red devil pasted against a white backdrop
and decked out in a pinned-on beaded necklace and soccer ball
earrings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really gaudy, but that's what the girls like," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although many of the winners were still being tabulated Saturday,
Quan received word that her little devil design placed second in the
Girls Under 12 Years of Age category.</TE>
<TE>   Banners are judged by local elected officials who manage to show
up on time.</TE>
<TE>   To his relief, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), showed up too late.
"The first thing you learn in politician school is never be a judge,"
he joked. "Because one team will like me and one team won't."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Carol Liu (D-La Canada Flintridge) showed up early
and was immediately handed a clipboard. "I'm doing this anonymously,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Points are given for creativity and overall design. But a banner
in which you can tell that the team members participated in the
craftsmanship gets extra points.</TE>
<TE>   The under 10-year-old boys of the Thrashing Mooses, (brown jerseys
translated to a brown-furred moose) were jumping all around their 3-D
banner depicting a smiling moose head. The mom who created the moose
head was lost in the grandstands, but the boys pointed out that they
were the ones who cut out the little moose soccer players surrounding
the banner.</TE>
<TE>   In South Pasadena, winning entries receive a simple ribbon. In the
Moorpark region and elsewhere winners may get anything from a small
trophy to tickets to see a Galaxy soccer game in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, parents say they make the banners for the fun it, to promote
team spirit and sportsmanship. But under their breath, the secrets
roll out. They did it because no one else wanted to.</TE>
<TE>   A klatch of parents who are professional artists, graphic
designers and animators seems to eagerly volunteer for this duty, a
natural way to fulfill their required volunteer soccer service hours.
That tends to put pressure on the banner amateurs, who don't want to
let their team down.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Coach Neal Jenkins of San Marino, said his wife, Helene,
couldn't find any faux tiger fabric for their team banner and settled
instead for a zebra print. "This was the closest we could come."</TE>
<TE>   Stumped over how to best illustrate her little boy's Patriot
Freaks team, Elizabeth von Bibra sought consultation with a graphic
designer her mother knows at Caltech.</TE>
<TE>   "Stars--we decided to use stars for each of their names," von
Bibra said. Her end product was a bold red, white and blue paneled
banner with floating stars holding fireworks, wearing an Uncle Sam
hat, carrying a flag.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah MacDowall, 48, a banner mom veteran, takes the chore on with
a sense of humor. "I've done lots of vegetable names, zucchinis and
peas. I've done fireworks out of toilet paper tubes."</TE>
<TE>   This year, members of her son's green-jersey Wild Peas team were
sensitive to the burden carried by their banner mom. Said Thomas
Banks, 8: "We wanted to be spinach, but peas were easier to make."</TE>

<HD>State Takes Sharp Turn on Emissions</HD>
<DH>Cars: With electric vehicles still impractical, hybrids and
gasoline engines are showing unexpected promise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California set out boldly 12 years ago to fill the highways with
smog-free, electric cars, but today air quality officials are quietly
admitting failure and embarking on a new strategy to cut tailpipe
emissions.</LD>
<LD>   The planned rollout date for the zero-emission vehicle is at hand.
But the arrival of fully functional and affordable electric cars is
nowhere in sight, as vacant battery-charging parking spaces at
shopping centers attest.</LD>
<LD>   As early as January, the state Air Resources Board is expected to
overhaul its regulations, moving away from electric cars and
emphasizing promising new technologies instead. These include
extraordinarily clean gasoline engines and hybrid cars powered by a
combination of batteries and a small combustion engine.</LD>
<TE>   The new technologies, which were not anticipated when the
electric-vehicle program began in 1990, are just now beginning to
come into their own.</TE>
<TE>   "We put a lot of faith in battery electric vehicles to meet the
[zero-emission vehicle] mandate but, in spite of significant efforts,
batteries have inherent limitations," said Alan C. Lloyd, chairman of
the state air board.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not giving up on the goal of the zero-emission vehicle, but
we have to be realistic. No matter how you cut it, it is
disappointing," Lloyd said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the failure to produce electric cars, the progress on
other fronts has buoyed hopes that ultra-clean, if not
battery-powered, cars are on the horizon. That is good news. Without
dramatically cleaner cars, trucks and vans, smog centers such as Los
Angeles, Bakersfield and San Bernardino will have little hope for
healthy, blue skies. Vehicles release about two-thirds of all
smog-forming pollutants across California, creating a pall linked to
bronchitis, asthma and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The battery car never lived up to expectations because
conventional lead-acid batteries don't produce enough power to make
electric cars perform like vehicles with gasoline engines. More
advanced batteries that improve performance still cost too much.</TE>
<TE>   "The battery electric car is not going to be viable any time soon.
It is dead on arrival," said Greg Dana, vice president of
environmental affairs for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers,
which represents 12 of the world's biggest automakers.</TE>
<TE>   Other technologies, however, are advancing rapidly. Some,
including hybrids and ultra-clean gasoline cars, are approaching
near-zero levels of emission. For air quality officials, it is an
unforeseen twist.</TE>
<TE>   "Have technology-forcing regulations paid off? Absolutely. Did it
pay off in the way we had hoped? No," Lloyd said. "If you keep
pushing technology and technology-forcing standards, you don't always
know what will accrue, what the side benefits are. There have been
side benefits, and there will be more benefits that would not have
accrued without our push."</TE>
<TE>   Standards effective with the 2004 model year require that the
cleanest new cars emit only one-twentieth the amount of smog-forming
material as is released by cars on the road today. Recent tests at UC
Riverside on 24 of those next-generation gasoline cars showed they
exceed even the most stringent California standard, a result
considered impossible several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   One Honda Accord, specially equipped with a sealed fuel tank and
exhaust traps, produced virtually no air pollution, said James M.
Lents, director of the Environmental Policy, Atmospheric Processes
and Modeling Laboratory at UC Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   "The air coming into the [car's] intake was more polluted than
what was coming out of the tailpipe," Lents said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can build some mighty clean gasoline cars today, a lot better
than people have argued could be built. It is possible today to build
gasoline vehicles that come close to zero pollution. The technology
has gone so far."</TE>
<TE>   Hybrid cars are proliferating too. About 15,000 hybrids, led by
the Toyota Prius and Honda's Insight and Civic, are on California
highways, officials estimate. Toyota Motor Corp. plans to produce
300,000 worldwide in two years, while the Big Three auto makers have
plans for hybrid vehicles beginning in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The hybrids are powered by batteries in support of small gasoline
engines. They cost about $4,000 more than conventional models. The
electric vehicle plan contains incentives for their production.</TE>
<TE>   Even though electric vehicles themselves have been a failure, the
requirement to build zero-emission vehicles "has been a huge
success," said Dan Sperling, director of the Institute of
Transportation Studies at UC Davis. "I define that in terms of
accelerating the development and commercialization of clean and
efficient technologies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's moving auto technology forward in a way that is desirable
along almost every dimension."</TE>
<TE>   The mandate is also credited for rapid advances in fuel-cell cars.
About 30 fuel-cell vehicles are undergoing road tests across
California today. Toyota announced in July that it plans to market 20
fuel-cell / hybrid vehicles by the end of this year. Fuel cells
generate electricity using hydrogen and produce no emissions.</TE>
<TE>   William Clay Ford Jr., chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor
Co., has predicted that fuel cells could replace the internal
combustion engine, and Rick Wagoner, GM's chief executive, has
described fuel cells as "the holy grail" automakers seek.</TE>
<TE>   But while the technology has been progressing, the state's
regulatory program has been stalled. The most recent setback came in
June, when a federal judge issued an injunction prohibiting
California from proceeding with key provisions of the
electric-vehicle program, pending the outcome of a lawsuit filed by
two automakers.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire program is in temporary disarray," said Roland Hwang,
senior policy analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   When the zero-emission vehicle program began, the goal was for 10%
of the cars of the 2003 model year that are sold in California to
produce no tailpipe emissions. It was an attempt by California to
revolutionize auto designs nationwide, because 1.8 million new cars
are sold in the state annually, more than in any other state. Soon
afterward, New York, Massachusetts and Vermont adopted similar
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, however, the mandate for zero-emission vehicles
met unyielding resistance from automakers in Detroit and Japan. The
Air Resources Board relaxed the law last year to require that just 2%
of new cars sold in California be electric-powered and added a
complicated formula that allowed automakers to comply by providing as
few as 4,400 electric vehicles by 2003 and 24,500 by 2015.</TE>
<TE>   Today, only 2,000 battery-powered vehicles, including sedans,
coupes, light trucks and vans, are on the road in California.</TE>
<TE>   They include General Motors' EV1, Honda's EV Plus and the electric
Ford Ranger pickup, according to the Air Resources Board. They were
built years ago and went out of production and most automakers have
no plans to build more. Toyota still produces an electric car, a
RAV4, capable of carrying several passengers and cargo, but it costs
$42,000, has a top speed of 79 mph and can travel only about 100
miles between charges. Toyota is not sure it will produce them after
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, automakers are building so-called neighborhood electric
vehicles and city cars to comply with the law. They are small, but
street-legal, battery-powered two-seaters. Some have a top speed of
25 mph and their niche seems restricted to short-hop deliveries at
college campuses, medical centers, film studios and planned
communities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a glorified golf cart," Sperling said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford built about 5,000 Think neighborhood vehicles before it
announced last month that it is ceasing production because of a lack
of demand.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that demand is being satisfied by General Motors, which is
giving away many of its 5,000 Club Cars, an electric cart with a
motor smaller than those in many residential lawnmowers.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. remains bullish about its mini Global Electric
Motorcars, or GEMs; about 1,800 are operating in California and more
are on the way. There are plans to incorporate them into the
13,000-unit Playa Vista development and other communities.</TE>
<TE>   "The full-size electric vehicles are not appealing to the public.
They are not full-function," said Reg Modlin, director of
environmental and energy planning for DaimlerChrysler. "It wasn't the
right way to start the program."</TE>

<HD>After Inglewood Tussle, Teen 'Has to Move On'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most people know him from a videotape: that kid who got slammed and
socked by an Inglewood cop.</LD>
<LD>   His large and close-knit family knows him, in the words of an
uncle, "to be the least likely kid in America" to tangle with police.</LD>
<LD>   Donovan Jackson, at 16, is a polite neat freak who irons his
T-shirts and fusses over his hair. He struggles a bit in school but
dreams of college and a modeling career. He has opened doors for his
grandmother since he was 6.</LD>
<TE>   He is also, relatives said, particular about his friends, about
baking from scratch, about video games--got to be Wrestlemania 18,
Spider-Man. He even wants his Cheetos just so. "He'll say, 'I gotta
have the perfect ones, unbroken,' " said Dominick Wells, 18,
Donovan's cousin and best friend.</TE>
<TE>   With the start of the school year, Donovan has returned to his old
routine, having escaped the blistering national spotlight after the
July 6 gas station encounter with police. Donovan finished summer
school at home, to avoid a storm of questions from classmates.</TE>
<TE>   But two months have passed and now, his family said, he wants life
to go on as before.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing OK in school; he says it's going fine," said his aunt,
Nancy Goins. "I'm sure the deep feelings are still there about what
happened to him.... Donovan's life has to move on."</TE>
<TE>   It is Donovan's senior year at Leuzinger High, the small public
school in Lawndale where he and Wells had a class together last year.
The cousins were trained as peer mediators--students who can be
called in to defuse peer conflicts before they grow violent.</TE>
<TE>   "We figured peer mediation class would teach us to handle things
better and deal with almost any situation," Wells said, shaking his
head.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is not lost on Donovan's loved ones as the racially
charged case continues to play out, with numerous investigations
underway and criminal cases pending against two Inglewood officers.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan's childhood dream was to be a cop, as was his father's.
His grandmother worked for 14 years for the Inglewood Police
Department that would jail father and son in separate cells after the
encounter.</TE>
<TE>   "Donovan would say, 'Grandma, I want to be a policeman when I grow
up,' " said Cora McGrew, who retired from the department 11 years
ago. "I'd say, 'No baby, Grandma don't want you to be a policeman.
It's too dangerous; you could get hurt.' "</TE>
<TE>   There may never be agreement on how a vehicle code infraction
devolved into a donnybrook. It is undisputed that, on that sunny
afternoon in July, at least one white officer struck the African
American teenager. Several minutes of the episode were captured on
tape by an amateur videographer and broadcast around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Police issued questions and commands to Donovan as he returned to
his father's car after buying potato chips and $6 in gas. Officers
told an L.A. County grand jury that he had not responded immediately.
Donovan told the grand jurors he had complied.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after the video was broadcast, Donovan's family told
reporters that he had a hearing problem and a speech impediment,
which could have accounted for any communications gap between him and
the officers.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan has made no public comments about the episode, not even
while sitting as Exhibit A last month in the second row at a hometown
congressional hearing on police misconduct. His media-savvy lawyer,
Johnnie Cochran, has kept him off limits.</TE>
<TE>   But in interviews, Donovan's friends and family tried to explain
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like people to know," said his uncle, Edward McGrew, a hotel
chain executive, "that Donovan is a good-hearted, basic, all-American
kid ... that has the same dreams as any other American kid--of one
day making something out of himself."</TE>
<TE>   Wells, who likes to dance and hopes someday to be a "funny
hard-core rapper," adds this assessment: "Donovan is just a wonderful
person."</TE>
<TE>   To know Donovan, his family said, is to understand that he doesn't
talk much. He speaks only when he has something to say. Relatives
describe his impairment as an "auditory processing disorder" that
makes it hard for him to grasp immediately what he hears.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after the gas station ordeal, Donovan's cousin,
Talibah Shakir, 50, a sixth-grade teacher, said, "He's been in
special ed most of his life." But she noted that he is also in
regular classes.</TE>
<TE>   He was one of 35 students in an after-school modeling program last
year. Classmates at Leuzinger said Donovan works hard and has a good
sense of humor. He doesn't swear or disrespect his elders. He was
never before in any kind of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents should be commended for raising such a nice child,"
said his former special education teacher, Cresia Green-Davis, newly
elected president of the Inglewood Unified School District board, at
a recent town hall meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan's father, Coby Chavis Jr., spoke proudly of his son in an
interview in the presence of his attorney, Milton Grimes. A
plain-spoken man, Chavis called Donovan "a good kid."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Inglewood, Donovan started talking normally but developed
a stutter by age 4 or 5, said Chavis, 41. It was unclear what
provoked the stutter, which worsened as Donovan got older. The
hearing ailment and resulting learning difficulties went undiagnosed
until he reached fifth grade.</TE>
<TE>   "The tests showed he is normal" in intelligence, Chavis said. But
by age 8, Donovan "was withdrawing into his shell," and school
officials had him assessed by a speech therapist. He was eventually
placed in a special education program, Chavis said.</TE>
<TE>   "When he talks, he sounds a little like a deaf person, but he
always responded; he carries on a conversation like anyone else,"
said John Minor, 17, who tutored Donovan in science last school year.
"He didn't stutter; it was more like ... he hesitated, especially
during a long conversation."</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, Donovan is close to his family and spends much of
his free time with his father, who works in construction scaffolding,
and mother, Felicia Chavis, 39, whose job involves driving
developmentally disabled adults to their work sites.</TE>
<TE>   Wells said Donovan's parents "are fun to be around. His dad plays
video games with us, and his mom feeds us, cooks lots of good food."
Donovan, who learned to cook from his mother, taught him to make
fried chicken, Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   When Grandma McGrew came home from heart surgery, Donovan stayed
with her, cooking, nursing and cleaning. "Mm-mm, that boy can cook,"
she said, chuckling. "He's like me, makes everything from scratch.
Nothing from the box."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan, she said, is an active member of Peace Apostolic church
in Carson, where he attends bible study and group outings. "God bless
your day," says the outgoing message on the family's answering
machine.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan's parents, together about 20 years, had him before they
married in 1999, and Donovan was given his mother's maiden name,
Jackson. The parents faced their share of setbacks: Chavis has spent
time in jail, and he fathered two daughters, now 7 and 11, with
someone else.</TE>
<TE>   A few months before Donovan's birth, court records show, Chavis
was convicted of selling an undercover officer $25 in cocaine. When
Donovan was about 3, a woman obtained a restraining order against
Chavis after alleging that he had threatened to kill her. No charges
were filed.</TE>
<TE>   When Donovan was about 10, Chavis was convicted of interfering
with an officer, a misdemeanor. When Donovan was about 13, the family
was evicted from an apartment in a rent dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said they do not believe Donovan was aware of or
affected by Chavis' past. Edward McGrew said Chavis straightened out
years ago. Family members said Donovan's parents have created a
loving family that spends almost every weekend with the larger clan.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan's relatives said that, if he was slow to answer police
officers, he was probably paralyzed by panic.</TE>
<TE>   That Saturday unfolded routinely, with father and son playing
video games at home in their boxy tan and stucco apartment building
in a well-kept Inglewood neighborhood where bars nonetheless cover
most windows. By late afternoon, they had been to the Great Western
Forum, where Donovan practiced driving in the parking lot (Chavis
merely grinned later when asked how it had gone).</TE>
<TE>   They went to visit Chavis' daughters, but not finding them home,
headed to dinner at Donovan's grandfather's place. First, they
stopped at the filling station about 5 p.m. for gas and chips.</TE>
<TE>   Two L.A. County Sheriff's deputies noticed an expired registration
tag on Chavis' Ford Taurus. The deputy who initially approached
Donovan told grand jurors that he had found the boy's
demeanor--breathing hard with an "angry stare"--potentially
combative, and decided to walk him away from his father, to his
patrol car. At that point, the encounter turned physical.</TE>
<TE>   Officers Bijan Darvish and Jeremy J. Morse were indicted by the
grand jury. They face a criminal trial--Morse on a charge of felony
assault under the color of authority, Darvish on a charge of filing a
false report by omitting Morse's having slammed the youth onto a
police car. Morse's defense attorney has said that Donovan, in cuffs,
grabbed Morse by the testicles and would not let go until Morse, in
pain, slugged him. Donovan has denied grabbing Morse.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan was arrested on charges of resisting arrest and
interfering with a police officer (charges that were later dropped).
Chavis was charged with driving without a valid license and
registration, and will be arraigned Nov. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan was traumatized by the beating, according to his father,
going to sleep each night on his parents' bedroom floor and wedging a
chair under the front door.</TE>
<TE>   "I've noticed," said his aunt, Nancy Goins, "that he seems to want
to cling to both his parents more."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan's family and friends said police assumed the worst about
Donovan and his father, and misread the teenager's fear as fury,
because they are black. The parents have filed a federal lawsuit,
alleging that father and son's civil rights were violated.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody is a poster boy for changing a flawed law enforcement
system," observed Green-Davis of her former student, "it would have
to be Donovan."</TE>

<LD>Nadadur S. Kumar had started in the direction of 36th and Catalina
streets several times, but the memory always turned him around. This
time he set out walking from the USC campus under a stubborn sun,
turned onto Catalina from Jefferson, and stopped his journey once
again.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if I can do this," he said, as he weighed the price
of continuing against the cost of turning back. Almost 11 months had
passed since police called him to the apartment building just up the
street.</LD>
<LD>   Kumar emerged finally from his thoughts. He took a wobbly step and
then another, and in moments, he was at the place he visits in his
dreams.</LD>
<TE>   "That one was hers," he said, pointing to an upstairs apartment
with the number 7 on it.</TE>
<TE>   Prasanna Kalahasthi, a 25-year-old USC dental student from India,
had lived there with her husband.</TE>
<TE>   When he was killed on one of the jets that crashed into the World
Trade Center, Kumar was the one who counseled Prasanna at the USC
Office of International Relations.</TE>
<TE>   He was also the one called to this apartment to identify the body
after Prasanna hanged herself.</TE>
<TE>   Grief, guilt, relief--all these feelings churned in Kumar as he
held his gaze on her apartment, as if proving to himself that he
could do it. Then he leaned against a wall and gathered his
breathing.</TE>
<TE>   "My legs are trembling," he said as we started back. But he soon
found a comfortable, more certain stride.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not so that he could begin to forget, Kumar said, but so he could
more comfortably remember.</TE>
<TE>   "I wake up many nights with that image of her," he said. "I don't
think I'll get away from it. I don't think it's an option. But I want
to remember. Look at all the good things that have happened in my
life. In many ways, it began with this."</TE>
<TE>   Five weeks. That's all the time he had known her. And yet Kumar,
at 49, said he has been remade in the year that has followed.</TE>
<TE>   He left USC several months ago to work as an immigration lawyer.
He goes in late so he can drive his children to school. He leaves
early for family events. He does free legal work for those who can't
pay.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked about this to no one, because I'm not a very public
person," he said as we walked back toward campus. "But it has changed
me in very deep ways. I used to be very concerned about getting
ahead, and my wife tells me I was an arrogant person. I don't measure
myself only on the basis of work now. I'm more humble. I reflect on
the transitory nature of life.</TE>
<TE>   "I now get up every morning and go to the room with an altar in
our house, and my wife sits with me. We don't say anything; we just
meditate. Every moment that comes into our lives now is the gift of
God, and my wife likes this in me."</TE>
<TE>   His cardiologist wife, his 17-and 15-year-old sons and an
8-year-old daughter are now at the center of his thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "My son got back his SATs--he scored 1,600. Well, it doesn't get
any better than this. I took him and I said, 'Come on,' and we
meditated together. I treasure these moments. I went to see a dance
performance by my daughter and was mesmerized. I never would have
gone before. I was too busy, and now I take my children to school and
we talk to each other."</TE>
<TE>   About what, I asked?</TE>
<TE>   "Everything. I ask them what they think of their dad, and my
daughter says, 'You're funny.' They ask me how I'm doing, and this
means more to me than anything. I used to be upset about getting
stuck in a traffic jam because I was wasting time. Now I welcome it.
It's more time with my daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why I don't want to let go. I clearly associate all of
it, in my rational moments, with this life-changing event in my life.
I thank Prasanna. I thank her in a spiritual sense."</TE>
<TE>   They had not known each other before Sept. 11. But soon she began
calling him at home, visiting his wife and mother-in-law, and sitting
in his office. She connected with Kumar in part because they'd both
had arranged marriages in India, and she told him her deceased
husband had been traveling too much and working too hard. He had
promised to spend more time with her soon.</TE>
<TE>   Kumar said she spoke beautifully in grief, her memories like fine
etchings, and she described so lastingly her final meeting with her
husband. He had taken her to a bus station and as her bus wheeled
away, she had watched him on the street, slowly fading from view.</TE>
<TE>   Kumar had no clue she planned to take her own life, nor did the
brother who had come to live with her.</TE>
<TE>   Many times, visited by guilt, Kumar wished he'd grabbed her and
forcibly taken her to a therapist rather than merely suggest it. But
she had said no, and he understood. In their culture, he said, you
find strength in friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   Prasanna left a recorded message to her family, and Kumar had
listened to it in their company.</TE>
<TE>   "She was unbelievably calm. She said, 'All I want is for you
people to understand and respect me for what I'm doing. It's a lot, I
know.... But I'm responding to this in the only way I can bring peace
to myself.' "</TE>
<TE>   Some of Kumar's acquaintances have questioned Prasanna's decision,
but he takes issue with them.</TE>
<TE>   As a Hindu, he said, she might well have believed she would be
reunited with her husband in death.</TE>
<TE>   She hung saris from the windows of her apartment before killing
herself, and Kumar takes it as an affirmation of her identity and
faith.</TE>
<TE>   "People feel a need to pass judgment on it, but I don't. Reflect
on it; don't make judgments. I used to see everything as right or
wrong, with very little in-between. Now I see just in-between.</TE>
<TE>   "I have grown. I'm more peaceful; I'm more spiritual. I feel less
concerned about what people think of me. Someone out there might say,
'Look at Kumar. This woman died, and he talks about how happy he has
become.'</TE>
<TE>   "But I didn't plan it. Someone commits suicide; I go and identify
the body. I didn't ask for this, but I accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Kumar was more at peace than the man I'd met up with 90 minutes
earlier. It was as if the day's trek had delivered him through sorrow
to a state of grace.</TE>
<TE>   "We as Hindus openly believe in destiny," he said. "I believe this
was meant to be exactly the way it unfolded, and I embrace the way it
has come into my life. I am sad and even in that sadness I am feeling
happy."</TE>

<HD>Bilingual Issue Drives Recall Battle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Francisco Gonzalez was angry. All he wants, the Santa Ana father
said, is for his two kids to be taught in English. And he wants to
kick out of office a school board member accused of improperly
supporting bilingual education.</LD>
<LD>   So the burly 25-year-old got up to speak last week at a raucous
board meeting of the Santa Ana Unified School District after
listening to a score of fellow Latino parents call his views racist.</LD>
<LD>   "I went through bilingual education and it got me nowhere," the
delivery man said. Gonzalez then switched to Spanish, his voice
quivering, jaw clenched.</LD>
<TE>   "Don't think I'm a racist; my parents are from [the Mexican state
of] Jalisco," he said, turning to a group of Latino parents. Many had
come to support trustee Nativo Lopez, target of a vituperative recall
campaign for his alleged defiance of a state law restricting
bilingual education.</TE>
<TE>   "I can speak in your language," Gonzalez said. But "I want parents
to have the right to have their children learn in the language they
choose."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, an immigrants rights activist, and his supporters say they
want that too. If parents want their children to learn in Spanish,
that also should be their right.</TE>
<TE>   Four years after passage of Proposition 227, which greatly
curtailed bilingual education, the choice of which language is spoken
in classrooms still evokes strong emotions in a city where
three-fourths of the population speaks Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   In Lopez, an outspoken critic of the 1998 ballot measure, the
opponents of bilingual education have found a target.</TE>
<TE>   Recall backers accuse him of encouraging parents to apply for
waivers to Proposition 227 regulations, thereby keeping bilingual
education alive in the district. Lopez denies the charges, and notes
that just 10% of the district's 62,000 students have waivers, a
percentage that has changed little in the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the recall against Lopez submitted nearly 15,000
signatures to the county Registrar of Voters on Thursday, setting the
stage for a likely showdown at the polls early next year. If at least
8,624 signatures are verified, the school board must place a recall
vote on the ballot, probably early next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana battle has even brought in the familiar face of Ron
Unz, the businessman behind Proposition 227, whose group has donated
money and equipment to the recall campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign against Lopez "may have enormous national
implications," Unz said in the newsletter of his Palo Alto-based
group, English for the Children. "If it is opposition to 'English'
that finally ends [Lopez's career] in one of America's most Latino,
Democratic, and non-English-speaking cities, then perhaps that issue
is indeed a magic political bullet."</TE>
<TE>   Unz's group is backing anti-bilingual education measures on the
ballot in Colorado and Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, the conflict is as much about bilingual education as
it is about Lopez. The 50-year-old is the longtime head of Hermandad
Mexicana Nacional in Santa Ana, a nonprofit group that lobbies for
and provides services to thousands of immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Few public figures in Orange County spark such extremes of hatred
and admiration.</TE>
<TE>   Many immigrants see Lopez, elected to the board in 1996, as their
sole voice because they cannot vote. Critics, however, say he pits
Latinos against whites and uses immigrants to advance his political
career.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez dismisses recall proponents as a coalition of few
disgruntled parents backed by residents who oppose building an
elementary school near their affluent area.</TE>
<TE>   Recall supporters also campaign for defeat in November of John
Palacio and Nadia Davis, who are seeking reelection. The two board
members supported the elementary school project. Lopez's term expires
in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not this innocent-sounding thing that they want their
children to learn English," he said. What his opponents really want
is to kill the school construction project, Lopez said. Bilingual
education is just a "knee-jerk, visceral issue" to that end.</TE>
<TE>   Visceral it is.</TE>
<TE>   Since the recall campaign began with a petition filed in March,
the two camps have traded insults and accusations on streets and in
parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   Recall proponents accused Lopez supporters of trying to intimidate
them as they sought to gather signatures. Lopez backers say the other
side has made racist remarks denigrating immigrants. Both sides deny
acting improperly.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana police have responded to at least a half-dozen
disturbance calls in the last month related to the recall effort. On
Wednesday, Lopez and Palacio skirmished with recall signature
gatherers at Santa Ana College.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, a Los Angeles man was cited for misdemeanor
assault after he allegedly spat toward Palacio, who was videotaping
the signature-gatherers.</TE>
<TE>   The recall campaign began with a small group of parents from
Edison Elementary School. They complained that their children are
floundering academically in a sea of Spanish-speaking children and
complacent school administrators.</TE>
<TE>   "My son was learning the alphabet in Spanish," said Veronica
Gonzalez, 23, Francisco Gonzalez's wife. The couple are bilingual and
have two boys in the school.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the very beginning, my younger son had been placed in
English immersion classes," she said of the first-grader. "They
didn't say anything to me, so I automatically thought he was learning
in English."</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 227 was designed to accelerate the English acquisition
of students still learning the language. By law, those students must
be taught primarily in English unless parents opt for bilingual
education by signing a waiver. Students with waivers learn academic
subjects in their native languages while also studying English to
gradually shift to mainstream classes.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, students learning in English should seldom, if
ever, hear another language in class. Then there is the reality.</TE>
<TE>   In a district where two thirds of the students still are learning
English, Spanish is likely to seep into classrooms, school officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is, children do not come in neat packets of 20," said
Edison Principal Mary Marquez, referring to class size.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have enough English-only students in kindergarten or
first grade to make a whole classroom."</TE>
<TE>   Marquez's English-only students are not taught in Spanish, she
said. But some of their classmates may receive support from bilingual
teachers or aides in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the overwhelming number of Spanish-speaking families,
the school also sends materials home in both languages. About a third
of Edison students are also in bilingual education because their
parents signed waivers.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say that despite such challenging demographics, their
students are making progress.</TE>
<TE>   According to the latest Stanford 9 test results, about 32% of
Santa Ana students scored at or above the national average this year.
The number was 21% four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Edison students are doing better, too, for the most part. The
number of its fifth graders scoring at or above the national average
on the Stanford 9 reading tests doubled in four years, from 10% to
20%.</TE>
<TE>   However, the school remains one of the state's lowest performers,
and critics blame the heavy presence of Spanish in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not against speaking two or three languages," said Jo Ann
Ramirez, a Santa Ana resident and recall supporter.</TE>
<TE>   "But English is the universal language and that's what [students]
should be taught. If they want to work in a car wash, that's fine,
but I don't think they should be relegated to only that."</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez and others blame Lopez for promoting Spanish and bilingual
education at the expense of academics.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez counters that such views are narrow-minded and imply that
English is superior to Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "It is nativism," said Lopez. "It is based on racism and
negativism."</TE>
<TE>   Many Latino parents at Edison and other Santa Ana schools see the
recall campaign against Lopez as an attack on their immigrant roots.</TE>
<TE>   "How can they deny where they are from?" Erika Gonzalez, 29, asked
of the Latino parents who back the recall. "The more languages you
know the better for you."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez opted to enroll her daughter Judith in bilingual
education at Edison Elementary. She is in kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   "She is learning English fine," the mother said. "It doesn't mean
they don't know their country. My daughter knows her flag. She knows
she's an American."</TE>
<TE>   The battle lines have been drawn with anti-and pro-recall placards
dotting many Santa Ana front yards.</TE>
<TE>   Boosted by their signature-gathering efforts, recall organizers
say they will keep the heat on Lopez. The trustee says he is ready
for them.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict has made the mood tense throughout the district, with
few willing to comment publicly.</TE>
<TE>   The last board meeting went past midnight because recall backers
and detractors traded jabs for hours. Palacio, the board president,
banged his gavel and called for order at one point.</TE>
<TE>   ''You  are out of order,'' someone in the audience shot back.</TE>

<HD>Local Voters Face Big Decisions</HD>
<DH>Politics: Ventura County ballots include land-use measures
and races for Congress, city councils and college board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even in this off-year election season, Ventura County voters will
have compelling choices this fall as they pick a new congressional
representative, decide who should lead the community college district
out of scandal and determine whether they really want to limit
suburban sprawl.</LD>
<LD>   Voters in nine cities will also select municipal leaders, and, in
12 school districts, decide who sets educational policy for thousands
of public school students.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with a lackluster governor's race and low-key state ballot
measures, local issues may be the primary reason voters go to the
polls Nov. 5, county leaders predict.</LD>
<TE>   "Certainly, people will come out for the land-use measures that
are on the ballot," Supervisor Judy Mikels said. "And it's probably
the first time in a long time anyone has paid attention to a
community college district election."</TE>
<TE>   The ballot also includes four Assembly contests. But newly drawn
districts heavily favor the incumbents in each race.</TE>
<TE>   Revamped congressional boundaries likewise appear to favor
Republican Rep. Elton Gallegly's chances of reelection to his Simi
Valley-based district.</TE>
<TE>   The new boundaries build on Gallegly's conservative base in
Ventura County, adding Vandenberg Air Force Base and the GOP-leaning
ranches and vineyards of northern Santa Barbara County. Republicans
hold an 11% edge over Democrats in voter registration in the
district.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly faces Democrat Fern Rudin, a Thousand Oaks public
relations consultant, and computer programmer Gary Harber, the
Libertarian candidate.</TE>
<TE>   In the county's other congressional district, Democrats solidly
outnumber Republicans, 45% to 33%. The long and narrow district takes
in environmentally conscious beach communities from Morro Bay in San
Louis Obispo County to Port Hueneme. The southern flank sweeps over
labor-friendly Oxnard, El Rio and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   This appears to favor Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara), political
analysts say. If Capps wins, she would be the first Democrat to
represent the western portion of the county in Congress since George
Outland served two terms during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   But winning the Democratic base won't be effortless, one political
analyst said. A third of the district--the Ventura County portion--is
new to the two-term congresswoman, having been added during the
recent round of redistricting, noted Herb Gooch, a Thousand Oaks
political analyst. Her Republican challenger, businesswoman Beth
Rogers, is a fourth-generation Ventura County farmer who speaks
fluent Spanish--a big plus in heavily Latino Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   If Rogers can raise enough money, the campaign will be
competitive, Gooch predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "Rogers also has her own money," he said. "It becomes much more of
a race."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides plan to spend up to $2 million on the campaign. Both
candidates have moderate views on taxes, the environment and abortion
rights, critical issues for the district.</TE>
<TE>   Capps received a $200,000 boost last week at a glitzy Santa
Barbara fund-raiser featuring former President Bill Clinton. The
event drew 700 supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers, meanwhile, raised about $45,000 when House Speaker Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.) stumped for her last month at a Simi Valley
barbecue. Rogers said she is not daunted by what many analysts
believe is an uphill battle.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a large bloc of Latino voters out there that will
identify with me because I identify with them," said Rogers, who has
studied in Mexico City and raised a Salvadoran child in her home.
"Every community has to have their vote earned."</TE>
<TE>   A third candidate in the race is Libertarian James E. Hill, a
plumbing inspector who lives in Grover Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In the college district race, 13 candidates are vying for three
seats. The normally low-profile district has come under intense
criticism in recent months over allegations of excessive spending by
suspended Chancellor Philip Westin.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Art Hernandez, who is seeking a second term, will have to
defend his approval of a new contract and a $30,000 pay raise for
Westin even as the chancellor's expense account was being questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez faces three challengers for his Oxnard-based district:
educator Ron Segovia Dyste, businesswoman Sylvia Munoz Schnopp and
mental health counselor Deshay Ford.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Norm Nagel, who also approved Westin's $203,000 contract,
is stepping down from his Thousand Oaks office, opening the seat to
five contestants. They are businesswoman Cheryl Heitman; parent Linda
Van Dolsen; management consultant Dan Peate; retired firefighter
Sandy Patrizio; and retired lecturer Carroll Bowen.</TE>
<TE>   The third seat, held by trustee John Tallman, has drawn two
challengers: teacher Mary Anne Rooney and accountant Kevin Laird.
Tallman was the only trustee to vote against Westin's contract
renewal, a record that should work in his favor at the polls,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Public fury over Westin, who was placed on administrative leave in
July, should also motivate voters to come to the polls, Mikels said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad to see the spotlight put on it because our community
college system is very important to Ventura County," she said.
"People should care about who's running it."</TE>
<TE>   Ballot measures concerning development will take voters' pulse on
stringent growth controls they enacted in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Initiatives in Ventura and Santa Paula ask voters whether they are
willing to allow large tracts of open space to be developed into new
homes. A Simi Valley measure, meanwhile, seeks to shrink the
boundaries in which subdivisions can be built.</TE>
<TE>   And in rural Ojai, voters will be asked if they want to be
consulted before new development or expansion is permitted.</TE>
<TE>   William Fulton, a national land-use analyst who lives in Ventura,
said the measures in Ventura and Santa Paula are an outgrowth of
initiatives adopted in the 1990s that require voter approval before
open space can be developed. Developers in both cities are now asking
voters to take the first step in approving large new subdivisions
that will dot hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing is the creation of a new political culture in
which voting on land issues is the norm," said Fulton, who has
publicly opposed the Ventura development. "It is clearly an outcome
of desire by voters and political activists to restrain or control
growth."</TE>
<TE>   November's election is critical because the outcome could set the
course for how future developments are approved, said Supervisor
Steve Bennett, a land-preservation advocate. If the Ventura and Santa
Paula measures get majority votes, it would pave the way for more
development that would be approved before going through a lengthy
city review process, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   However, if they are rejected, it would send the message that "you
need to go to the City Council first. That will set a political
precedent," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula voters also will be asked if they want to create five
separate districts for electing municipal officials, an outgrowth of
a voting rights lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Other measures query voters on new taxes in Santa Paula and
Fillmore, and a school bond in Somis.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbents in nine cities are being challenged or stepping down.
Nowhere are the choices more plentiful than in Thousand Oaks. Twelve
candidates are vying for three seats there, including one being
vacated by Councilwoman Linda Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Parks is stepping down mid-term to take a seat on the county Board
of Supervisors. The growth politics that have consumed Thousand Oaks
in recent years are expected to continue in this election.</TE>
<TE>   Development is also a major theme in Santa Paula's municipal
election.</TE>
<TE>   The newly seated council could determine the aging farm town's
future, because if the city's land-use initiative passes, the council
will be called on to review the housing development in Adams Canyon
that is expected to follow.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of new development say the city of 28,000 must raise
its tax base to grow out of poverty. But critics charge the high-end
homes envisioned for Adams Canyon would not benefit the city's
working-class population and would degrade quality of life by
bringing additional traffic and pollution.</TE>

<HD>Bear Invasion Brings Family More Woes</HD>
<DH>Challenges: Daughter's cancer is followed by loss of home
to a fire started by bruins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SULLIVAN BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>FOREST FALLS</DL>
<LD>The Pendleton family's August vacation was a long-awaited escape from
their troubles: the young daughter's brain cancer, her endless doctor
visits, and, not least, the bears that had besieged the family's home
here at the foot of the San Bernardino Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   But trouble was waiting for the Pendletons when they got home. A
day after they returned, the pair of black bears that had already
charged their daughter and ransacked their kitchen in previous months
slipped into the house one more time. While the family was out
grocery shopping, a mother bear and her cub knocked over a halogen
lamp and set the house ablaze--incinerating the home and perishing in
the process.</LD>
<LD>   Now the family is living with relatives while they try to rebuild
their home, their lives and their daughter's health, with the aid of
a community that has rallied to their cause.</LD>
<TE>   The Pendletons' misfortune is an extreme consequence of the
bargain residents of this forest community have struck with nature.
In exchange for the beauty of the wild land, with its craggy canyons
and ancient white fir, they accept the risks of living with wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me really sad that my home was destroyed and two bears
lost their lives," Kelly Pendleton said. "I choose to live here, so I
can't get angry at them."</TE>
<TE>   The family's problems began last fall when 10-year-old Tiffany
began suffering severe headaches, a lazy left eye and unsteady gait,
her mother, Kelly, said. An MRI revealed that she had astrocytoma, a
cancer that had formed a tumor in her brain stem.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, she underwent surgery to remove most of the growth.
The small amount remaining was inoperable, but radiation treatments
stemmed its growth, said her pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. Daniel Won.</TE>
<TE>   The surgery and subsequent treatments left the child with facial
palsy, eye problems and lingering sores on her lip and nose. She
missed the remainder of her fourth-grade school year.</TE>
<TE>   By summer, Tiffany was in remission, with "a very good prognosis"
for a long-term cure, Won said. She was looking forward to returning
to school in the fall. The local firefighters named her "Little Miss
Forest Falls" at the town's annual chili cook-off in July. She
accepted the title in a gown and rhinestone tiara.</TE>
<TE>   But trouble was lurking. In June, Tiffany had left the house to
walk to her grandmother's nearby home, then raced back in, screaming
that a mother bear with a cub had charged her. Kelly went out to
investigate and was greeted by the furious mother bear.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few weeks, the bears broke into the family's Honda
Civic, poked into their kitchen window, and then squeezed entirely
through it, rummaging through the refrigerator and devouring $300
worth of groceries, Kelly Pendleton said.</TE>
<TE>   Bear problems had been mounting in Forest Falls, on the road to
Big Bear Lake, for months. Bears have visited the wooded community
for decades, but this summer they seemed more aggressive, local fire
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're much less scared of people than they were before," said
Eric Sweetman, a fire prevention officer with the U.S. Forest
Service. Repeat exposure to people might have eroded their natural
caution, and drought may be driving them to desperation in a search
for food.</TE>
<TE>   The mother and cub that harassed the Pendletons had reportedly
ransacked other homes as well, said local fire Capt. Tom McIntosh.</TE>
<TE>   Once a bear breaks and enters, it is subject to state laws that
allow the public to kill predators that damage their livestock or
property.</TE>
<TE>   Under those provisions, the Pendletons received a permit to trap
the mother bear and cub that had hounded their household, said
California Fish and Game Warden Rick Fischer.</TE>
<TE>   The mother and cub eluded capture, Kelly Pendleton said, although
several other bears were trapped and released.</TE>
<TE>   With the bears still at bay, the frazzled Pendleton family decided
to drive up to the Monterey coast for a getaway from looting bears
and the medical issues back home.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to take [Tiffany] away and give her a break from
everything--her tumors, the stress of the bears, all the doctor
visits," Kelly Pendleton said.</TE>
<TE>   Wary of the bears' return, the family boarded their kitchen
windows and cleared their cupboards.</TE>
<TE>   The family had just returned from their vacation when they went
out to buy groceries. During their absence the bears returned and
apparently burst through the front door and knocked over a halogen
lamp, said Al Flores, a fire investigator with the San Bernardino
County Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   The lamp set fire to the wood floor, and the house went up in
flames. Through the smoke, firefighters spotted the mother bear
asphyxiated in the bedroom, the cub curled up dead on the bathroom
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Blackened roof tiles now droop over the hole where the family's
living room once stood. Twisted box springs and charred furniture lie
in a heap in their frontyard, near piles of smoke-stained clothing.</TE>
<TE>   For Tiffany, it's a treasure trove of memories. On a recent visit
to the site, she was elated to discover an unburned jewelry box with
a bracelet she had made as a gift. Earlier, her mother retrieved her
burnt tiara from the wreckage. But the 10-year-old, who calmly
endured a year of cancer treatments, has cried every day since the
fire, Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Now living at Tiffany's grandmother's house down the street, the
Pendletons are making plans to rebuild. Their hardship has struck a
chord with the public, which contributed thousands of dollars to the
family. A local restaurant held a spaghetti dinner for their benefit,
and neighbors drop by with clothes and toys for Tiffany and her
2-year-old brother, Noah.</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany, whose Beanie Baby collection was lost in the fire, has
received boxes of the stuffed animals from donors. With her cancer in
remission, she expects to return to school shortly.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the uncertainty and the persistence of the neighborhood
bears, the Pendletons say they plan to stay put.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lived up here for years and we love our community and
everybody up here," Kelly Pendleton said. "Bears aren't going to
chase us off."</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs Bills on Seniors, Rural Health Care Coverage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis approved a health care package Saturday that he said
will protect families' access to health care in rural areas and
improve services for senior citizens.</LD>
<LD>   Davis signed Assembly Bill 1282, sponsored by Assemblyman Dennis
Cardoza (D-Merced), which expands coverage to people who have been
denied enrollment in health care plans because they live 15 miles
outside designated service areas.</LD>
<LD>   Cardoza said commercial medical plans are leaving thousands of
rural Californians without access to affordable health care. Rural
counties have higher percentages of low-income people who must travel
great distances to receive health care, and who frequently pay more
for specialty care, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "These problems are especially severe for seniors," he said. "That
really went to the heart of the bill."</TE>
<TE>   The measure also requires a health maintenance organization
planning to leave an area to hold a public meeting at least 30 days
before leaving and to provide notice of that hearing in a local
newspaper. The new law applies to health care service plans in
counties with no more than 500,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Zingale, director of the state Department of Managed Health
Care, said that when HMOs pull out of rural areas, it is particularly
troubling for seniors, because often, when one HMO leaves, another
follows.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this bill will take an important step toward making HMOs
think twice before making rash changes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also signed Senate Bill 339 by Sen. Deborah Ortiz
(D-Sacramento), which imposes new requirements for transferring
residents of long-term care facilities that have closed.</TE>
<TE>   The bill increases from 30 to 60 the number of days that are
allowed for residents to find another placement. It also requires the
Department of Health Services to prevent transfers when relocation
services are not provided to the resident.</TE>

<HD>Suits Spell Trouble From O.C. to U.N.</HD>
<DH>Police: Accused of harassment, former Assistant Sheriff
Dennis LaDucer tried new start with Bosnian force, only to face new
allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Dennis LaDucer, getting a job as the second-highest-ranking
official in the United Nations' Bosnia police force was a second
chance for a life in law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   His first career collapsed in 1997, when he was fired as Orange
County's assistant sheriff amid accusations from five women that he
groped, propositioned and otherwise sexually harassed them.</LD>
<LD>   Now his work with U.N. police has drawn a cloud of suspicion.</LD>
<TE>   LaDucer was accused of visiting one of Bosnia's notorious brothels
at the same time the U.N. was supposed to be cracking down on the
country's prostitution rings.</TE>
<TE>   And the head of the U.N. Office of Human Rights in Bosnia
criticized LaDucer for fostering a "boys-will-be-boys" attitude.</TE>
<TE>   The case, involving disputed accusations and contradictory
investigative findings, has received much attention in the European
press. The United Nations refuses to comment on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   LaDucer, 57, denies visiting brothels, hiring prostitutes or
acting improperly during his 18 months in Bosnia. Though his contract
with the U.N. ended last year, he returned to Bosnia this summer to
fight the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I have this dark cloud over me?" asked LaDucer, who is now
back at home in San Clemente. "There was no rule or regulation that I
even came close to violating. I just wanted to do a good job and
redeem myself after all of the other stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Accusations in O.C.</TE>
<TE>   The Bosnia job came at a low point for LaDucer.</TE>
<TE>   He had been a rising star in the Orange County Sheriff's
Department. A trusted aide to Sheriff Brad Gates who worked for the
department for 31 years, he was viewed as a possible successor. Then,
several employees of the department reported numerous instances of
sexual harassment by the assistant sheriff that dated back several
years.</TE>
<TE>   Five women filed suit; Gates fired LaDucer in 1997, saying his
one-time protege had violated department policies and conducted
himself in an "inappropriate way."</TE>
<TE>   LaDucer denied the accusations and for three years fought the
lawsuits, which the county eventually settled for more than $1
million. He and his wife divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Broke, LaDucer needed a new job. He contacted DynCorp, an
international company based in Texas that hires Americans for
overseas work, including positions at the United Nations. In March
2000, DynCorp sent LaDucer to Bosnia as a U.N. police monitor.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for DynCorp would not say why it decided to hire
LaDucer, other than to confirm that he worked at the company "for a
time." LaDucer said he told DynCorp about his legal problems and said
the lawsuits were settled.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Over</TE>
<TE>   LaDucer started his assignment in March 2000, at a desk job on the
Croatian border, monitoring local police.</TE>
<TE>   One of the country's biggest problems was the trafficking of women
for prostitution. Brothels, also called night bars, sprouted in the
mid-1990s as the country began rebuilding after its war. Lured across
the border with promises of legitimate jobs, women were forced to
dance at Bosnian clubs and perform sex acts; those who refused were
beaten.</TE>
<TE>   Even before LaDucer arrived, there were accusations that some U.N.
personnel were patronizing the very brothels they were supposed to be
helping local authorities shut down. Human rights groups criticized
the U.N. as unwilling or unable to control its 1,600 employees from
40 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Stung by the accusations, U.N. officials in July 2001 created a
new team to combat the prostitution rings. By then, LaDucer had been
promoted as the task force's deputy commissioner, the No. 2 job in
the police force.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, a team of U.N. investigators began
interviewing former prostitutes, asking if they recognized U.N.
personnel as customers.</TE>
<TE>   A Romanian prostitute identified LaDucer from a photo lineup. She
said he was one of several "internationals" she'd seen in July while
working at the Vila Bar, a brothel in Doboj.</TE>
<TE>   Accusations in Bosnia</TE>
<TE>   LaDucer insisted to his superiors that his accuser was mistaken,
offering his calendar and travel logs as proof. His stint with the
U.N. ended in November, and LaDucer says he returned to California
thinking the issue was resolved. But in late June, LaDucer's name
surfaced in a legal battle in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Former U.N. police monitor Kathryn Bolkovac was suing DynCorp
after having been fired from the police force in April 2001. The case
was heard in Britain by a government labor board because DynCorp's
business activities in Europe are covered by British employment law.</TE>
<TE>   Bolkovac, of Lincoln, Neb., alleged that she was fired in
retaliation for a memo she sent to 50 top U.N. officials complaining
about U.N. personnel patronizing Bosnian brothels.</TE>
<TE>   Bolkovac's memo didn't identify any officials by name. But
Madeleine Rees, a British attorney and one-time head of the U.N.
Office of Human Rights in Bosnia, did. She testified on behalf of
Bolkovac that LaDucer, as deputy commissioner, displayed a cavalier
attitude about prostitution and visited a brothel himself.</TE>
<TE>   Rees testified that after Bolkovac was fired, LaDucer wrote a memo
critical of her that appeared designed to hurt her credibility. Rees
also cited a U.N. investigation that concluded LaDucer shouldn't be
rehired and that his "persistent denials raise serious questions
about his integrity and his professionalism."</TE>
<TE>   The London press reported the news with gusto, dubbing the story
"The Sins of the Peacekeepers."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to Clear Name</TE>
<TE>   Back in San Clemente, LaDucer said he felt helpless to answer the
accusations being made against him in Britain. So he flew to Bosnia
to meet with U.N. investigators in an effort to clear his name. He
said he gave officials the results of a lie-detector test he took in
California that he said showed he was telling the truth about the
brothel visit.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials declined numerous requests from The Times to
discuss the case or details of LaDucer's departure. But LaDucer
provided two letters written to him by U.N. investigators, dated July
25, concluding there was no evidence that he had ever been at the
brothel. One letter also recommended that he receive an apology.</TE>
<TE>   LaDucer's sense of vindication was short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   No apology was forthcoming, and two weeks after he received the
letters, the British labor board ruled in Bolkovac's favor. Among its
findings, the panel said LaDucer's memo was proof of "virulent
animus" against her. The panel did not address whether LaDucer had
visited the brothel.</TE>
<TE>   Another hearing next month will determine how much compensatory
damages Bolkovac is entitled to receive from DynCorp.</TE>
<TE>   LaDucer recently got a new job in Orange County; he declined to
name his employer. He and his wife have reconciled.</TE>
<TE>   But he knows the Bosnia scandal, on top of the Orange County
sexual harassment cases, has further hurt his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll never go away, and it'll never be cleared up," he said.
"I'm always coming from behind. It's embarrassing. People look at me
say, 'That stupid SOB. He can't stay out of trouble.' "</TE>

<LD>Two men were killed Saturday morning in La Puente after a fight broke

<LD>   Antonio Ramirez, 17, and Arturo Cisneros, 20, died from gunshot
wounds to their upper torsos. Three others, John Hernandez, 20,
Gustavo Contreras, 20, and Ruben Contreras, 19, were also shot and
were being treated at hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting occurred in the 700 block of Vineland Avenue about
12:15 a.m. After three Latino men entered the party, an altercation
broke out and one of the suspects began shooting into the crowd,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials were searching for the suspects, who left the
party in a late '90s Honda Prelude, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana's Downtown Throng Digs Party for All the Americas</HD>
<DH>Celebrations: The three-day annual cultural festival is big
on family fare, ranging from entertainment to politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Families had a day in the sun Saturday in downtown Santa Ana, where a
three-day annual festival gave tens of thousands of Latinos and
others a taste of their familiar roots and other cultural samplings.</LD>
<LD>   Wafting through the crowd were the aromas of tacos, carnitas and
roasted corn on the cob. Musical offerings featured such instruments
as the Peruvian pan flute.</LD>
<LD>   "It reminds me of a big fair in Mexico," said Altis Ramos, 25, who
left that country three years ago to settle in Tustin. "It's
difficult to go back there frequently, so this is kind of like a
piece of home."</LD>
<TE>   That's the whole idea of Fiestas de las Americas, the Latin
American street festival concluding today.</TE>
<TE>   Now in its 14th year, the fiesta began as a celebration of Mexican
Independence Day on Sept. 16th. But last year the focus was broadened
to celebrate the cultures and independence days of all Latin American
nations, many of which also fall in September, and to honor the
United States and victims of last year's Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Covering about 12 square blocks, bordered roughly by 1st and 5th
streets to the north and south, and French Street and Broadway to the
east and west, the festival was expected to attract more people than
ever over its three-day run. Judging from the packed attendance
Saturday afternoon, that's probably about what it will do, said
Mitchell Liday, a hired organizer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good weather, a good crowd and the focus is on families," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many families strolled 4th Street and other thoroughfares
Saturday afternoon, stopping at the festival's dozens of booths.
Among the offerings were free advice from lawyers and financial
experts, spinning-wheel games with prizes, vendors selling sombreros
and baseball caps, political booths sporting such signs as, "Here's
Where You Change to Republican," and free samples of Spam.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment on the huge stage at the end of one street
featured such acts as traditional Latin American dancers and singers
and Majica Juventud, a children's dance troupe from Bell Gardens
whose 80 members deliver Latino interpretations from many countries
and in a variety of styles, including rap.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fun to hang out, walk around, get food, do a little
shopping and celebrate Independence Day," said Vanessa Brito, 14, of
Irvine. "It's an important day."</TE>
<TE>   For her mom, Vycki Brito, 32, who came to Orange County 20 years
ago from her native Mexico, the experience was more profound. "I love
it," she said. "I used to come here as a teenager, and now I bring my
kids. It's great to pass on our heritage and keep them in touch. I
want them to know where their parents are from."</TE>

<HD>Orphans Get a Lifeline From Rotary Club</HD>
<DH>Two Woodland Hills residents coordinate service group's
campaign to bring food, supplies to abandoned children in Baja
California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By nearly all measures, John Whitmore and Sheri Polak have led
prosperous lives--they've retired from successful careers, raised
children, traveled the world and served their communities.</LD>
<LD>   Now in their late 60s, Whitmore and Polak have no plans to quietly
live out their golden years. Instead, the longtime friends are the
driving force behind an outreach project that collects and
distributes food, clothing, toiletries, medicine and money to Mexican
orphans.</LD>
<LD>   As members of the Woodland Hills Rotary Club, a community service
organization, Whitmore and Polak for the last six years have
coordinated the group's visits to Door of Faith Orphanage, a
residential facility for disabled and able-bodied abandoned children
in La Mision, Baja California.</LD>
<TE>   There, Southern Californians D.J. and Lynette Schuetze look after
110 children, whose ages range from 6 weeks to 18 years. The
sprawling ranch is dotted with buildings connected by wheelchair
ramps and is set around a courtyard with brightly painted swings and
jungle gyms.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a family here," D.J. Schuetze said. "We have groups of
five and six siblings that the social workers bring to our door. We
take them in and make them part of our family."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Rotarians have supported the orphanage for nearly
three decades, their commitment deepened last spring when a popular
17-year-old quadriplegic boy, Carlitos, died and the orphanage
struggled to pay his funeral expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a boy who had been there for a long time," Whitmore said.
"He had wormed his way into everyone's heart."</TE>
<TE>   With renewed energy, the Rotarians figured they could gather and
give more supplies if they asked others to pitch in.</TE>
<TE>   The group turned to El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills,
where students collected enough rice, beans, disposable diapers,
laundry detergent, toilet paper and other items to fill a classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The supplies were delivered to the orphanage in early August.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after the students' delivery, a dozen Rotarians
arrived at the orphanage in three cars loaded with milk, butter, hot
dogs, cleaning supplies and other items, Polak said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rotarians greeted the children and immediately fired up a
grill to cook hot dogs for 60 youths before the youngsters had to
leave for an afternoon session of school.</TE>
<TE>   "When we go there, it's like a big party," Polak said. "The kids
are singing and playing and talking to us. They get to show off their
good manners and practice their English."</TE>
<TE>   Door of Faith is a private facility that relies on donations to
keep its doors open, Whitmore said.</TE>
<TE>   The orphanage has no other means to generate income to cover its
monthly expenses for electricity, food, gasoline and other
necessities.</TE>
<TE>   Rotarians wanted to give the orphanage commercial washers and
dryers to clean the 50 loads of laundry that pile up each day, but
the orphanage can't afford to pay for the electricity.</TE>
<TE>   The facility received a walk-in refrigerator, but it doesn't have
the money to keep it stocked, Polak said. "As we went through the
food in the refrigerator, there were hot dog buns, carrots, potatoes,
onions, eggs and 10 pounds of chicken that looked awful--like it had
gone bad and someone gave it to them to get rid of it. There was
nothing to make a meal."</TE>
<TE>   The children at the orphanage are ferried to schools throughout
Tijuana and, with round-trips to three different schools every
weekday, the Schuetzes struggle to keep gas in the orphanage's bus,
Whitmore said. "The kids can go to school, but they need money for
gas, uniforms and school supplies."</TE>
<TE>   Even after arranging donations, or writing out checks beforehand,
Rotarians who visit the orphanage are moved to give a little more on
the spot.</TE>
<TE>   "On a past trip, we were about to leave, and I said, 'Did D.J. say
he only had $105 in the bank?' " Polak recalled. "The men reached
into their pockets and left money on the side of the kitchen sink. I
was so moved by that."</TE>
<TE>   Whitmore said his goal is to get all 66 members of the local club
to live out Rotary International's motto of "service above self" by
visiting the orphanage at least once.</TE>
<TE>   "When members get to the orphanage, you see the change in them,"
he said. "They have an 'Aha!' experience because they make a personal
connection with the children and they want to help even more."</TE>
<TE>   Extending a helping hand across the U.S.-Mexican border has proved
a challenge on more than one occasion as Mexican border patrol
officers have questioned club members about the items they tried to
take to the orphanage, Whitmore said.</TE>
<TE>   "One time, we were trying to bring steaks to the children, and a
border patrol officer demanded them," Whitmore said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our members said, 'If you really want to take one, go
ahead, but a child will go without.' The officer let us through."</TE>
<TE>   Another time, border patrol officers stopped the Rotarians from
bringing a truckload of school desks into the country, Whitmore said.
While a few members stayed with the truck, others crossed over and
returned with children from the orphanage who carried the desks
across the border one at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "When we take money and food to the orphanage, we know that we are
helping the children directly," Polak said. "It's a selfish thing to
go there because you feel so good when you help."</TE>

<HD>Fever for Secession in Harbor Area Cools</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Having lost their bid for cityhood, many on the
waterfront are uninterested in the Valley and Hollywood campaigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Los Angeles' harbor neighborhoods, faces used to brighten and
voices rise at the mere mention of secession.</LD>
<LD>   Now, people shrug and sigh.</LD>
<LD>   Many San Pedro and Wilmington residents said they don't give much
thought to secession these days. Their hopes of carving their own
city out of Los Angeles diminished in May, when a state commission
placed San Fernando Valley and Hollywood breakaway initiatives on the
Nov. 5 ballot, but rejected a similar proposal for the harbor area.</LD>
<TE>   "The feeling is, 'Well, we're not seceding. Ho hum, life goes on,'
" said Noel Park, a secessionist and president of the San Pedro and
Peninsula Homeowners Coalition, which represents 13 homeowner groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We have too many other things to worry about," said Maria
Hernandez, as she lugged grocery bags along a littered, weed-strewn
street near her Wilmington home. "Just let it be."</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders in the Valley and Hollywood said the harbor
area--which has a population of 145,000--remains one of their
strongholds. To win, the ballot measures must carry a majority of
votes in the secession area as well as a majority citywide.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to do real well in the mayor's neighborhood," said
Gene La Pietra, founder of the Hollywood secession movement. Mayor
James K. Hahn and his sister, City Councilwoman Janice Hahn, live in
San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   If a municipal divorce occurs in the Valley or Hollywood,
secessionists in those regions said, it could revive the harbor
independence drive.</TE>
<TE>   "The harbor understands the importance" of voting for a split,
said Richard Close, a Valley cityhood leader. "In a few years, [it]
will want to go through the same process."</TE>
<TE>   But even the harbor secession leader, Andrew Mardesich, said he
isn't so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not as enthusiastic as before," said Mardesich, a San Pedro
resident. "People here aren't enthusiastic either. We're stuck with
L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Mardesich said he will vote for the Valley and Hollywood measures
and lend his support at campaign events. But he is less enthusiastic
about harbor cityhood and is considering moving out of the area.</TE>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission halted the harbor area's
three-year breakaway crusade after finding that the proposed city
would suffer financially if it broke from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the prospect of independence had drawn excited crowds
to community meetings, and Valley and Hollywood secessionists had
counted on the harbor area to be a third front in the election
battle.</TE>
<TE>   Breakup advocates said the harbor area should still deliver plenty
of votes for the Valley and Hollywood bids because the problems that
fueled secession sentiments linger: The storage containers and rusty
cranes that blight the waterfront. The factories and refineries that
belch pollution. The potholes that crater alleys. The struggling
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   During lunch time at an outdoor fish market and eatery in San
Pedro, the only diners on a recent day were fat seagulls picking at
discarded crab shells. In the nearby downtown district, a host hummed
and danced in front of another empty restaurant. At Walker's Cafe, a
hole-in-the-wall at Point Fermin Park, a palm-lined area on San
Pedro's bluffs, business was better, but the mood toward Los Angeles
wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never gotten our fair share," said Robert Torres, 38, a
longshoreman who was born at the harbor. He was having a beer with
friends at Walker's. They swapped jokes about being the stepchild of
Los Angeles, but said they doubt they will vote for the Valley and
Hollywood proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should I?" asked Reggie Perez, a 39-year-old longshoreman and
San Pedro native. "What does the Valley matter to me?"</TE>
<TE>   Making a root beer float was Carol Tedrow, a waitress who fled the
Valley years ago for the harbor's breezy climate and seaside vistas.
"At least if the Valley [secedes] and screws up, it's the guinea
pig," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Hahn said she understands the ongoing frustrations
with City Hall. But secession fever has cooled in her district, she
said, because of the city's redevelopment plans for the area.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no longer a driving force for secession in the harbor,"
the councilwoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Not necessarily, said die-hard secession supporter Anne Gusha,
who, with her son, owns Williams' Book Store, a musty, independent
shop established in 1909.</TE>
<TE>   The 83-year-old has lived in San Pedro for most of her life. She
has watched charming bungalows crumble and breathtaking harbor views
disappear behind industrial buildings. She has seen gang graffiti
deface parks, schools and entire neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to leave L.A.," she said.</TE>

<HD>Richard Holmes, 73; Fought for 'Death With Dignity' Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard L. Holmes, who became a central figure in thwarting a federal
challenge to Oregon's Death With Dignity Act, has died of colon and
liver cancer. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Holmes died Monday in his Portland home, surrounded by his family.</LD>
<LD>   He never took the fatal dose of Nembutal he had fought so hard to
obtain.</LD>
<TE>   Holmes had always said he might never drink the deadly cocktail,
but he felt better knowing the $117 prescription was stored in his
cool basement.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the option. I want a choice," he told The Times on Nov. 7
last year. "That's all I want."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of weeks before that, two doctors had confirmed that
Holmes had less than six months to live, and that he was mentally
competent to decide when and if he wished to take his own life.</TE>
<TE>   Their decision, after a 15-day waiting period, would qualify him
for a lethal prescription of barbiturates under the Death With
Dignity Act, passed by state voters in 1994 and again in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon officials say that 91 people, most suffering from cancer,
have used the law to speed their deaths, and that at least 10 times
that number, like Holmes, have obtained the lethal medication but
never used it.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes' prescription was to be filled, after the 15-day waiting
period, on Nov. 9, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But on Nov. 6, U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft attacked the state
law by ordering federal drug agents to revoke the licenses of any
doctors prescribing the fatal dosages.</TE>
<TE>   Before Ashcroft launched the administrative assault, the Oregon
law--the only one of its kind in the country--had survived a federal
court challenge, a repeal attempt and two congressional override
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Prevented from obtaining his own fatal prescription, Holmes joined
Oregon officials, a handful of other terminally ill patients and the
Compassion in Dying Federation of Oregon to challenge the Ashcroft
directive in court.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Portland temporarily blocked the attorney
general's order, and in late November, Holmes did have his comforting
medicine of choice in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   On April 17, the federal court ruled that Ashcroft and the U.S.
Department of Justice could not interfere with the state's law, after
Oregon Atty. Gen. Hardy Myers successfully argued that regulating
doctors is the sole responsibility of states rather than the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   The case is now on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "When the quality of my life is not worth living, then I want to
stop living," Holmes said when the court case was heard last spring.
"It should be my decision."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Portland, Holmes attended the University of Portland, then
sold swimming pools in the San Fernando Valley for many years.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to his hometown, he sold burglar alarm parts until
his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   He spent the last eight years in and out of hospitals, beginning
with double heart bypass surgery in 1994. A year later, he had a
liver transplant.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Holmes was diagnosed with colon cancer, and underwent
surgery and a lengthy course of chemotherapy. Then the cancer spread
to his liver, where it was diagnosed as inoperable.</TE>
<TE>   Early last November, Holmes told The Times he expected to live no
more than four to six months, even if he never obtained the
prescription to hasten his demise.</TE>
<TE>   He lived nine months.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes is survived by his son, Richard L. Holmes; his daughter,
Cindy M. Taylor; his brother, Dr. David M. Holmes; and four
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is planned for Monday at O'Connors Restaurant
in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations may be sent to the Compassion in Dying
Federation of Oregon.</TE>

<HD>Jobless Rate Up Again in County</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County unemployment surged for the second straight month and
job growth remained stagnant in August, as a troubled national
economy and a local housing crisis resulted in a double-dose of bad
economic news.</LD>
<LD>   About 24,400 local workers had no jobs last month, up 1,300 from
July and 1,900 more than in August of last year. That pushed the
county's jobless rate to 5.7% from 5.4% the previous month. That
compares with 5.3% for August of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The local jobless figure, usually low compared with other
jurisdictions, matched the nation's rate for the first time in years.
But it remained well below the California rate of 6.2%, without
seasonal adjustments.</LD>
<TE>   "We've still got a low unemployment rate. It's essentially full
employment in Ventura County," said Mark Schniepp, director of
California Economic Forecast. "Yet we have [little] job growth. Low
unemployment usually accompanies job growth."</TE>
<TE>   That is not occurring in Ventura County or in some other counties
in coastal Southern California, Schniepp said, because the cost of
buying or renting a house or apartment is so high that some companies
are not expanding and some are balking at moving here.</TE>
<TE>   "Housing is the obstruction," he said. "So employers cannot hire,
and if they could, people wouldn't take the positions. This is the
most important issue we have to address. There's a total housing
frenzy still going on."</TE>
<TE>   Because of soaring prices, only about 28% of local households can
afford to buy a home in Ventura County, according to California Assn.
of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Still, except for agriculture, Ventura County's employment picture
wasn't gloomy in August.</TE>
<TE>   There were 302,200 total jobs in the county, up 200 from July and
800 from last year at this time.</TE>
<TE>   Farm jobs were off 700 from July and down 1,200 over the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   But government employment was up 800 positions, all of that in
education as the traditional school year began late in the month in
some districts. Construction and retail trades were up 200 each, and
manufacturing was up 100.</TE>
<TE>   Of local cities, the three with the most farm worker residents had
the highest jobless rates: 9.1% in Santa Paula, 8.1% in Oxnard and
7.8% in Fillmore. The white-collar east county had the lowest rate,
with Moorpark's 4.3% the lowest in that area. Ojai, where one-fifth
of residents are senior citizens, had a 3.0% rate.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's unemployment rate was tied for 28th best of 58
counties in the state, and on par with Southern California, which has
weathered the recession far better than the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   On Ventura County's flanks, Los Angeles County had a jobless rate
of 6.8%, while Santa Barbara County's was 3.5%.</TE>

<HD>Lease on Learning for Motel Kids</HD>
<DH>County program provides a school and a sense of stability
for homeless children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before going to sleep, Jack Bennett makes sure his four children are
dressed--not for bed, but for school.</LD>
<LD>   For the single father and his children--Crystal, 8, Jack Jr., 6,
and twins Jasmine and Natalie, 5--getting everyone ready in their
small room with two beds at the Anaheim Eagle Inn and Suites is a
daily struggle. To save time, the kids shower and dress the night
before.</LD>
<LD>   School itself has been a struggle for the children, who have
bounced from motel to motel since the family was evicted from an
Anaheim apartment more than a year ago, their father said. Thanks to
the Homeless Outreach Program in Education, though, the Bennetts and
dozens of other youngsters have an academic safety net.</LD>
<TE>   Project HOPE, the only school of its kind in Orange County,
provides instruction for 54 homeless children in kindergarten through
eighth grade. The safety net is expected to widen when child-care
services are made available at a Fullerton College center in Anaheim,
which opens early next year. Public schools soon will have to develop
plans to help such children under a new federal law.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, each weekday, a yellow school bus plies the motel
rows of Anaheim, Buena Park, Garden Grove and Santa Ana to ferry the
kids to and from the First Presbyterian Church of Orange, where three
teachers instruct the children, who are divided into three
classrooms. Some kids come from as far away as Irvine and San Juan
Capistrano, dropped off by parents or grandparents and mostly living
in cars.</TE>
<TE>   Educators and parents said the school's smaller classes allow for
individual attention, continuity and a more nurturing environment for
the children--many of whom have bounced from school to school, even
district to district--as their parents have struggled to find
housing.</TE>
<TE>   When Crystal Bennett started at the school a year ago, she
couldn't read. Within eight months, her father said she was reading
Dr. Seuss books to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like my teachers and my friends because they are so
nice," said Crystal.</TE>
<TE>   Project HOPE was founded in 1989 by the county Department of
Education. At first, informal classes were held in parking lots and
motels. It has evolved into a fully functioning facility.</TE>
<TE>   The state and county education departments cover $320,000 for
teacher salaries, materials and other costs. Busing this year is
costing about $70,000, paid for through the county social services
agency and donations. The church underwrites much of the program by
charging $2 a month for its facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation is one of the program's biggest hurdles because
county social services funds won't be available, principal Tony
Gibson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Without transportation there is no Project HOPE," Gibson said.
"But if the kids can't come to us, we will come to them somehow."</TE>
<TE>   The number of homeless has spiked 17% in the last year, according
to county records. And 16,000 of the estimated 23,000 homeless people
in the county are parents and their children.</TE>
<TE>   Motel families can be found across Orange County, but Karen Roper,
the county's coordinator for homeless programs, said people tend to
gravitate toward Anaheim and Buena Park, and other cities in the
north and central part of the county with many motels.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, some Orange County cities such as Anaheim and
Santa Ana have tried to limit motel stays, which means people switch
motels or rooms within motels frequently. The impact on children can
be harsh.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest trauma and pressure for kids is just having to move
around so much," Roper said. "They have no relationships and are
sometimes so behind in school, it's just tragic."</TE>
<TE>   Project HOPE tries to ease the upheaval.</TE>
<TE>   As they surfed the Internet for information on medieval culture
during a recent morning computer session, 20 fifth-to eighth-graders
beamed with excitement.</TE>
<TE>   "This school is a lot more fun," said eighth-grader Karen
Gillespie, 13, who has been at the school for five years. "Some kids
at other schools were mean."</TE>
<TE>   Educators say the pressures of an unstable family life and
derision of peers can cause some homeless children to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes homeless kids become the target of their peers because
they don't necessarily have the best clothes," principal Gibson said.
"The children find comfort in being around others who are going
through the same experience."</TE>
<TE>   When children first come to the school, teachers assess their
skills. While they'd like them to catch up to grade level and return
to regular school, that isn't always possible if a family's finances
remain unstable.</TE>
<TE>   For the Bennetts, it means dad gets up at 5:15 a.m., the children
at 6 a.m. to put on socks and shoes before he drops them at a nearby
motel where their mom lives.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Bennett, 31, puts them on the bus at 7:30 a.m. and meets them
in the afternoon. Jack Bennett collects them after working as lead
stock clerk at a computerized lock-making company.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to lie and say that it's been easy," Jack Bennett
said. "But I try to keep it from them and just try to get them out of
here."</TE>

<HD>Woman Sues in False Death Report</HD>
<DH>Court: Retired schoolteacher says she is having nightmares
after being told by a hospital nurse that her ill husband had died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A phone call jarred Martha Weaver from a fitful sleep at 2 a.m. and
it took a few seconds for the news to filter through her
early-morning haze.</LD>
<LD>   The caller, who identified herself as a nurse at St. John's
Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo, said that Weaver's 64-year-old
husband had just died, two days after being hospitalized with heart
trouble.</LD>
<LD>   When Weaver and her daughter, Cmell, 35, had left Ben Weaver just
a few hours earlier, his spirits were good, his condition improving.
In fact, the nurses were arranging to move him out of intensive care.</LD>
<TE>   Now on the short drive from their Somis home to the Camarillo
hospital, Martha and Cmell (pronounced Camille) Weaver were arranging
for a funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Only it turned out that Ben Weaver was alive. The hospital had
called Martha Weaver in error, which she discovered after learning on
arrival that her husband was sound asleep in his hospital
bed--snoring.</TE>
<TE>   "It was absolutely the most wonderful sound," said Martha Weaver,
whose first reactions had been to notify the family's church of her
husband's death and try to contact their son, who was on a Navy ship
near Guam.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver's relief turned to anger and then concern over what she
feared was a flaw in the hospital's notification procedures. She
resolved to make sure that such an upsetting mistake doesn't happen
again.</TE>
<TE>   Martha and Cmell Weaver filed a lawsuit last week against Catholic
Healthcare West, operators of St. John's Pleasant Valley, and
Nationwide Nursing Services, which employed the temporary nurse who
made the June 20 call.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed in Ventura County Superior Court, seeks
unspecified damages for pain and suffering, as well as payment for
medical expenses and other costs related to physical problems the
women say they have experienced since the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed to us, after some discussion, that there should be some
accountability," said Martha Weaver, 62, a retired schoolteacher.
"This should never have to happen again to anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   St. John's spokeswoman Rita O'Connor would not comment on the
lawsuit but issued the following statement:</TE>
<TE>   "We deeply regret that this ever happened. We are taking steps to
prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. When we
recognized what happened, we provided the family with the correct
information and apologized for this unfortunate incident."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Catholic Healthcare West did not return a phone
call seeking comment, and a representative for Nationwide Nursing
Services declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The incident calls attention to the growing reliance on temporary
or traveling nurses at hospitals across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Kay McVay, president of the California Nurses Assn., said
hospitals are spending more than $10 billion annually on what are
called registry nurses as a way of controlling costs and meeting a
nationwide shortage.</TE>
<TE>   But often what hospitals get for their money are temporary nurses
with less education, fewer skills and a lack of knowledge about the
institutions they work for, McVay said. That can lead to a lapse in
following a hospital's policies, procedures and practices, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I fully believe that the industry has created a monstrosity with
use of these registries," said McVay, adding that hospitals would be
better off spending their money hiring more full-time nurses.</TE>
<TE>   "They felt this was a better way of controlling their labor costs,
but I think they have been finding out in the last few years [that]
this is not necessarily the best route to take," McVay said</TE>
<TE>   She said that in her 43 years of nursing, she has never heard of
such a mistake being made.</TE>
<TE>   "You're usually pretty careful about who you call," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard attorney Gregory L. Johnson, who filed the lawsuit on
behalf of the Weavers, said for purposes of this case it doesn't
matter whether the nurse worked for a registry service or directly
for the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The nurse, Heather Smit, acted as an agent of the hospital
"because she appeared in the same nurse's uniform as other hospital
personnel, acted just as other nurses who were employees [and] held
herself out as hospital personnel ....," according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   At no point during the 2 a.m. conversation with Martha Weaver did
the nurse ask the name of the person she had called, identify the
patient by name or clarify that she was talking to the correct
family, the lawsuit says.</TE>
<TE>   The nurse told Weaver that her husband had died peacefully in his
sleep but that there had not been time to notify the family before he
died, the lawsuit says.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Weaver turned pale and her breathing became shallow and
rapid, the lawsuit states. Her skin became cold and wet and she began
shaking uncontrollably.</TE>
<TE>   Cmell Weaver, a fourth-grade teacher in Moorpark, covered her
mother with blankets and tried to keep her alert, according to the
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving at the hospital, the Weavers met with the nurse who
had placed the call. As soon as Smit saw them, "she rose to her feet,
covered her mouth and said, 'Oh, my God, I called the wrong family,'
" the lawsuit says.</TE>
<TE>   The women were taken to Ben Weaver's room in the intensive care
unit.</TE>
<TE>   "I was relieved, absolutely relieved," Cmell  Weaver said. "It was
pretty close to joy when I heard him snoring."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Weaver is home now and on the mend. The retired machinist
learned about the incident from his wife and daughter and is
concerned about how it was affecting them.</TE>
<TE>   Martha and Cmell Weaver are now undergoing counseling. Both say
they have trouble sleeping and suffer from nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the kind of person who likes to move forward, to not spend an
exaggerated amount of time ruminating on a bad situation," Martha
Weaver said.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very grateful that my husband is alive, but the emotions
[of that day] are still there."</TE>

<DH>Families: Foster father organizes tribute to four orphans'
mother, who died last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strangers who earlier this year saved four orphaned brothers and
sisters from being split up and sent to separate foster homes stepped
forward once more Saturday night--this time to help the children
bring closure to their ordeal.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens gathered for a memorial service organized by the
youngsters' foster father to honor the memory of Katherine Lee, the
mother of 15-year-old twins Shane and Patrick; Emily, 14; and Grace,
12.</LD>
<LD>   "I look around this room at every one of you. If it weren't for
you, I would not have the privilege of continuing to raise her
children," said their new father, Gavin Glynn, as he stood next to a
flower-covered table bearing a box containing Katherine Lee's ashes.</LD>
<TE>   "There's not a day that goes by that I am not so grateful that she
taught these children to never give up--and they haven't."</TE>
<TE>   Incense was burned, prayers were said and tenor Bob Mack sang "You
Are So Beautiful"--a song that Katherine Lee once performed as a
percussionist with Joe Cocker's band. As the music filled the room at
the Los Angeles Friendship Center, Emily dabbed her eyes and Grace
buried her head on Patrick's shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives them permission to move on, but to know they have a
spiritual connection with their mother," Glynn explained. "They
needed an opportunity to thank their teachers and other people who
changed the course of their lives forever."</TE>
<TE>   If the gathering at the Mid-City-area Buddhist center was unusual,
so is the way people from throughout Los Angeles have rallied to help
the children since Lee's death last December.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, a 46-year-old employee of a Venice moving and storage
company, was stricken with a heart attack at the family's North
Hollywood home. Although the children quickly called 911 and Patrick
followed directions from the emergency operator and performed CPR
until paramedics arrived, their mother died later at UCLA Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   A family friend took in the four children until her landlord
demanded that they leave by Feb. 1. The eviction order prompted a
counselor at Fairfax High School, where Shane and Patrick are
students, to launch a frantic campaign to find a place for the four
to live before they were swept into the county's 51,000-child
foster-care system.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fine, we have each other," the boys had told counselor
Amanda Jiggins. But she knew better. Teenagers are notoriously hard
to place in foster homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so worried that the second they got into the system they'd
be dispersed," said Jiggins, who attended Saturday night's service.
"The boys had said it: They had each other. That was the only thing
they had left."</TE>
<TE>   Within a few days, the search turned up Glynn, who heard about the
children through a gay fathers support group called Pop Luck. Because
the 41-year-old television writer was already adopting an 8-year-son,
Iby, he was certified as a foster father. The Lee children moved
immediately into his five-bedroom West Adams District home.</TE>
<TE>   A Times story on Feb. 2 described the orphans' unusual placement
and prompted hundreds of others to become involved with their new
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Readers donated food, clothing and gift certificates. One signed
over a 1999 Chevrolet Suburban large enough carry all of Glynn's
instant family. Others donated desks and other furniture, a freezer
and a king-size kitchen table. Los Feliz Costco store manager Kevin
Green donated $300 a month in groceries in perpetuity.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly $40,000 was contributed by readers to a college fund for
the children. Donations continue to be accepted at "Lee Children's
Irrevocable Trust," Merrill Lynch Private Client Group, 16830 Ventura
Blvd. No. 601, Encino, CA 91436.</TE>
<TE>   The Korean-American Federation of Los Angeles collected $4,000 for
the youngsters, who share a Korean, Hawaiian, Samoan and Irish
background. A Los Angeles couple, Steven and Suzie Cha, invited the
children into their home and began taking them to Koreatown
restaurants to introduce them to the Korean culture, according to
Glynn.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Chun, a deputy district attorney, volunteered to mentor
Emily and Grace. "They shop and do girl things together," Glynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Diane Stanfield pledged free legal service for the adoption
process--which includes a search for Lee's former husband, who walked
out on the family a dozen years ago.</TE>
<TE>   One reader was partly responsible for Saturday's memorial service.
Richard Hart, a concert producer, helped find Katherine Lee's missing
remains.</TE>
<TE>   For months after her death Lee's body could not be located.
Initially, those helping the children speculated that it might have
gone for medical research or been disposed of after going unclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   But Hart prevailed upon a friend who works for the county to snip
through red tape and track down the cremated remains, which had been
cataloged under a combination of her maiden and married names. He and
Grant Gochin, a Chatsworth resident involved with Pop Luck, paid the
$500 cremation fee.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday Glynn said he is convinced that his instant family
will thrive. He has begun the adoption process--and has adapted
himself to a house filled with "KROQ music," empty Slurpee cups and
two cats, a dog, a hamster and a goldfish.</TE>
<TE>   Although a practicing Buddhist, he is raising the children in
their Catholic faith. Emily, in fact, enrolled this year at Holy
Family Academy in Glendale. The boys continue at Fairfax High and
Grace attends John Burroughs Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   "For Emily's eighth-grade graduation we went out to the Twin
Dragon for dinner. We joked and laughed and had so much fun. We'd
been together four months at that point and we were starting to have
a history together," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "At that moment, I thought, 'You know what? We're gonna make it.
We're a family.' "</TE>
<TE>   These days, there is even light-hearted banter about Glynn's being
gay. "The other day Emily said, 'I think you're looking at that girl
over there.' I told her I was looking at the girl's shoes," Glynn
laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's service was attended by several Fairfax High School
students who played a role in alerting adults to the Lee children's
plight earlier this year. Skateboarders Jason Mendez, 16, and Alex
Kapstan, 15, are members of an informal group that stores its
skateboards in Jiggins' counseling office during the school day. They
sat next to Patrick and Shane as Buddhist leader Eiji Miyamoto
offered words of comfort.</TE>
<TE>   "We were chanting that 'I will be your eyes, your legs, your
hand,' " Miyamoto explained. "Your mother is a really happy woman
now."</TE>

<LD>You probably never heard of Larry Bales. He spent his 33 years in the
Orange County assessor's office often driving his bosses nutty and,
in a couple of cases, getting them indicted and sent to jail.</LD>
<LD>   Ah, they're just not making public employees like they used to.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never been in the in-crowd," Bales says. This tends to
happen when you blow the whistle on your superiors, challenge them in
elections and testify against them before grand juries.</LD>
<TE>   Bales, 60, retired as a deputy appraiser last month after
suffering a heart attack on Aug. 2. Almost from the time he answered
a newspaper ad for a job in county government in 1969, Bales, an
Oklahoma native who knew almost nothing about Orange County, didn't
like what he saw.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think he would have quit. Or that he might have just kept
quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he went to a grand jury in the early 1970s and testified
about what he thought was a bribery case involving superiors.
Eventually, two successive county assessors were indicted and
convicted on bribery or related charges, as well as a chief deputy
assessor.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1990s, Bales was still tormenting his bosses. In 1994, he
blew the whistle on the assessor's failure to make a deadline on
property-tax appeals. That failure eventually cost the county an
estimated $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   When Treasurer Robert Citron tried in 1995 to direct the blame for
the county's bankruptcy to Merrill Lynch, Bales called it "the
biggest cover-up in the world" and said blame lay with county
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Bales tipped reporters to other real or perceived
misdeeds in county government. He says he also went to the grand jury
"a couple other times and nothing happened." All the while, he says,
he was simply heeding his father's long-ago advice that the country
faced greater threats from within than without.</TE>
<TE>   The years haven't altered that viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have a 9/11, but that's not going to kill us as a
country," he said last week at his Tustin home. "But our own
corruption will. When people no longer watch government, that's going
to be our downfall. From within, not without."</TE>
<TE>   If it weren't for the fact he was proved right so many times,
people would have dismissed Bales as a crank. Instead, his was a
career that deserves a parting toast.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to preserve a little bit of the institutions, a little
bit of America," he says. "That's important to me. I'm not bitter. I
have a good attitude, even though I had the heart attack."</TE>
<TE>   He stumbled into the bribery scandal of the 1970s by accident. He
was doing an appraisal when an electronics company manager offered
him free equipment for a favorable assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "They started talking to me about the way things happen," Bales
says. "I said, 'Where do they do that?' and they said, 'Orange
County.' "</TE>
<TE>   "I realized I was right in the middle of a bribery situation,"
Bales says. "I could have kept my mouth shut and got a stereo out of
the deal and a promotion, but, no, stupid Larry goes to the grand
jury."</TE>
<TE>   That led to the convictions of his superiors and, Bales says, his
own blackballing.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat in a corner [of the office] doing remedial stuff for nine
months.... I don't think I was making an announcement saying I was
talking to the grand jury, but they knew."</TE>
<TE>   At least four times--he's not quite sure himself--he's run for
county assessor or recorder. Bales' last try for office came last
March, when he got 35% and lost to another of his superiors in the
assessor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Unchastened, Bales still laments what he considers irregularities
in the county's method of property assessment and says taxpayers are
"still being cheated."</TE>
<TE>   But he also knows his days of windmill-tilting are done.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a burden that's off my shoulders now," he says.</TE>

<HD>Davis Whittles at Stack of Bills</HD>
<DH>Policy: Marathon debate and signing sessions mark his days
as he nears Sept. 30 deadline to OK or veto 1,200 measures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGG JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>At 6 p.m. last Wednesday, 17 state health and social services
officials, budget experts and senior staff of Gov. Gray Davis
gathered in a secure Capitol conference room with nothing but bulging
ring-binder notebooks--no television cameras, lobbyists or even
well-meaning lawmakers to distract them.</LD>
<LD>   For three hours, pausing only to devour slices of pizza, they
dissected 55 health-care bills approved by the Legislature and
forwarded to the governor's office. It was the fifth such session
conducted by Davis' senior staff that day, on legislation affecting
everything from education to the environment, all aimed at distilling
months of legislative debate and lobbying into a simple
recommendation to the governor: Sign or veto.</LD>
<LD>   At this session, participants talked about what each bill was
supposed to do, why it was good or bad policy and what it would cost
or save Californians.</LD>
<TE>   By the time the closed-door conference broke up, Davis' Deputy
Chief of Staff Susan Kennedy was prepared to make recommendations to
her boss that would determine the fate of most of the 55 measures.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has until Sept. 30 to act on more than 1,200 bills approved
by the California Legislature before it adjourned in the wee hours of
Sept. 1. Most are now sitting only a few feet from the governor's
office, in a locked inner sanctum known as the "War Room," packed in
file boxes marked "Chillin' "--a slangy way of saying the bills have
yet to reach the governor's desk.</TE>
<TE>   As Davis approaches the end of his first term, endless speculation
shrouds his decisions on legislation and appointments, in part
because of the Democratic governor's penchant for secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republican lawmakers, lobbyists and other critics say the
governor is guided by political calculations and campaign
contributions. Davis and his supporters, however, say those decisions
are the culmination of a rigorous review by staff members and the
governor himself.</TE>
<TE>   The Wednesday vetting session attended by a Times reporter--a rare
glimpse inside the Davis administration--suggests a freewheeling
debate among Davis' trusted aides and executive branch officials as
bills make their way from the Legislature to the governor's desk.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he cares about his legacy and doesn't want to be seen as
hurting the economy," said Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), noting
that Davis has signed dozens of her bills over the last four years,
including many that were opposed by powerful interests. "[But] you
could not say this governor is serving moneyed interests if you look
at the bills he's signed."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Davis aides acknowledge the governor factors in
who is supporting and opposing any major bill--just as lawmakers
listen to lobbyists and campaign contributors when they're weighing
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis pays particular attention to the priority lists of powerful
interest groups like the California Chamber of Commerce, the
California Labor Federation and the Sierra Club, said Press Secretary
Steven Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll go down and look and see what the different groups said
about it in their letters and testimony and read through all that,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more closely watched decisions Davis must make is on a
bill that would provide paid family leave to workers--something that
is common in other industrialized countries.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, SB 1661, presents Davis with a dilemma: Its author is
Kuehl, and its sponsor is the California Labor Federation, which
counts it as perhaps the most important of 19 bills it currently has
on Davis' desk.</TE>
<TE>   But the California Chamber of Commerce hates the bill and put it
high on its annual "job-killer list."</TE>
<TE>   Davis isn't saying what he's going to do, and both sides admit
they can only guess as to whether the governor will sign or veto the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's cautious preference for not tipping his hand on a
controversial piece of legislation frustrates many lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "You rarely hear early on from the governor or governor's staff on
any piece of legislation," Kuehl said.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, however, Davis eventually warned Kuehl through staff
contacts that he would object to legislation requiring businesses to
shoulder the costs of family leave, she said. So Kuehl shifted the
costs to employee contributions and scaled back the bill's reach by
inserting amendments that cut the length of any leave to six weeks
from 12 and imposed other restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Aware that Davis might make a decision on her legislation in the
middle of an all-night session of bill signing, Kuehl said she tries
to make sure she has given his staff the answers to every question he
might ask.</TE>
<TE>   "I still don't know if it's going to be signed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As the day of a final decision on major bills nears, lobbyists
also try to work every last possible angle.</TE>
<TE>   For Tom Rankin, the president and legislative point man for the
California Labor Federation, that means pitching senior staff members
one final time, firing off letters that will go into the file the
governor reviews and organizing allies to bombard Davis and his staff
with their own phone calls, faxes, letters, e-mails and personal
contacts.</TE>
<TE>   The California Chamber of Commerce is making a similar effort, but
chamber officials also don't know which way the governor is leaning.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guess is that it'll be one of the last he takes up because
it's one of the more controversial bills out there," said Michele
Perrault, a spokeswoman for the group.</TE>
<TE>   Davis isn't known for soliciting advice from legislators--another
fact that grates on some members of the Senate and Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "[Former Republican Gov. Pete] Wilson called legislators to talk
to them about their bills, and if it was really a big bill, he let
them come down and make their pitch to him," said Assemblyman Bill
Leonard (R-San Bernardino). Davis occasionally calls a bill's author
to ask about the legislation's intent and its importance, but that's
where he draws the line, said Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's in a bill-signing mode, he doesn't like to be pressured
about legislation," Maviglio said. "He doesn't take a lot of calls
from legislators during that time. He likes to look at the bill in
its folder from a fresh perspective rather than doing a favor for a
legislator."</TE>
<TE>   Before Davis and his staff can begin their deliberations, the
bills have to be physically moved from the Senate and Assembly to the
governor's office--no small feat with 1,200 bills and accompanying
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Since Aug. 12, a contingent of National Guard personnel has been
cloistered in the windowless War Room in the governor's office,
helping the staff sift through sheaves of documents and letters.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving this room, the serious vetting begins in the
meetings led by Davis Chief of Staff Lynn Schenk, Deputy Chief of
Staff Kennedy and other senior staff members.</TE>
<TE>   At the Wednesday session on health-care legislation, Kennedy was
joined by Richard Figueroa, the governor's legislative assistant for
health care and a walking encyclopedia on the 100-odd health-care
bills approved this year.</TE>
<TE>   Others around the four tables drawn into a rectangle included
Grantland Johnson, secretary of the California Health and Human
Services Agency; Diana M. Bonta, director of the state Department of
Health Services; Rita Saenz, director of the Department of Social
Services; and a few budget experts from the Department of Finance.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy kept the discussion moving at a fast pace, firing off
probing questions, soliciting various positions on a particular bill
and cutting off the discussion when she had heard enough to make a
recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   "What does the bill actually do?" she asked again and again. "Why
are we doing this?" "What problem are they trying to fix here?"</TE>
<TE>   The $24-billion budget shortfall that confronted the state this
year--and the threat of another huge gap next year--hung like a cloud
over the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a $24-billion deficit--does this increase our general
fund cost?" Kennedy asked about a bill that is supposed to improve
health-care access.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy ended the discussion on that bill after 20 minutes, with
the health and finance contingents split on whether the governor
should sign or veto the legislation. The governor would probably be
inclined to sign, Kennedy said, but she admonished the bill's
advocates in the room to find a way to avoid hiring new people to
administer the program.</TE>
<TE>   Some bills passed muster on merits but failed the cost test in a
brutal budget year.</TE>
<TE>   "So what's our veto message?" Kennedy asked about some bills.</TE>
<TE>   The aim is to deliver bad news as gently as possible,
acknowledging the need a bill was designed to address without seeming
too callous for killing it because it costs money the state doesn't
have.</TE>
<TE>   The packet Davis gets on every bill includes a summary that
describes the legislation and its fiscal impact, lists arguments for
and against the bill and notes sponsors, supporters and opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the bills are dozens of pages long and have been heavily
amended over the past months in the Senate and the Assembly. Others
are the product of a legislative sleight of hand known as "gut and
amend," essentially disguising a bill by slipping it into the carcass
of a dead bill.</TE>
<TE>   On most difficult bills, Davis will gather in his Cabinet room
with senior aides, representatives of the affected agencies and the
finance director, aides say. The governor starts with a set of broad
questions: What does this bill really do? How does it compare to what
other states have? Is California acting alone? Is there federal
legislation that covers this? Is there a need for this bill?</TE>
<TE>   "He'll sit there and often engage in debate about the bill, have
an advocate for the bill, or--whatever position the staff
recommends--actually argue with him," said Maviglio. "On a difficult
bill, I've seen him spend more than an hour."</TE>
<TE>   But the vast majority of bills involve only small technical
changes in law and require little discussion. Davis plows through
hundreds of them as he travels the state, performing his duties as
governor, campaigning for reelection and, critics note, raising funds
from groups and individuals who often have a stake in legislation
sitting on his desk.</TE>
<TE>   "When we can sneak five bills in an hourlong ride somewhere,
that's five fewer bills," Maviglio said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis will finish the month with a four-day bill-signing marathon.
As he decides landmark issues such as binding arbitration for farm
workers and paid family leave, legislative assistants will be waiting
at computers, ready to write a veto or signing message dictated by
the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "A good number of the letters have a message, 'This is a great
idea, but we don't have the money,' " Maviglio said. "I think you'll
see a lot of that this year."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 3,000 years, the wrathful spirit of a banished Cahuilla
shaman named Tahquitz has kept watch over his namesake canyon in the
rugged, boulder-strewn San Jacinto Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   For just as long, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians has
produced lesson-legends as wondrous and complex as the desert
landscape itself.</LD>
<LD>   Tahquitz Canyon has been Shangri-La to filmmakers, hippies,
hermits, the homeless and the legendary Tahquitz.</LD>
<TE>   Only a few minutes southwest of downtown Palm Springs, the new
Tahquitz Canyon Visitor Center--operated by the Cahuilla Indians, who
created the Tahquitz myth millenniums ago--is a place where tourists
can view old photographs, ancient Indian artifacts and a 15-minute
film on the "Legend of Tahquitz."</TE>
<TE>   To this day, legend has it, Tahquitz (pronounced Taw-kwish)
continues to consume the souls of those foolhardy enough to venture
into his canyon. Some tribe members refuse to enter, just to be safe.</TE>
<TE>   So powerful is Tahquitz, believers say, that he can manifest
himself in various forms: an earthquake, an animal, lightning, an old
man or a meteor.</TE>
<TE>   Through the centuries, Tahquitz has been blamed for desert mayhem,
including deaths, drought, famine, flash floods, fires and just plain
bad luck. Even today, when the earth shakes, local Indians say
Tahquitz is up to his old tricks.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the legendary curse doesn't worry everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Tribal Ranger "Mountain Bob" Hepburn, for example, takes groups
into the canyon every day, twice a day, for guided two-mile hikes.
The curse seems to roll off his back like water over the falls.</TE>
<TE>   To him, the canyon's beauty is far more meaningful than a myth.</TE>
<TE>   "This canyon and these rocks seem to bring something out in the
spirit of the people who come here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Along the hike, Hepburn points out wildlife, ancient rock art and
a century-old irrigation system, all while detailing the many uses of
dozens of native plants.</TE>
<TE>   The creosote bush, for example, was the Cahuillas' medicine chest,
used for everything from lung congestion to bowel complaints. The red
barrel cactus, which is dark green with red spines, was used like a
Crock-Pot, to cook meals. Jojoba was used as shampoo.</TE>
<TE>   Wending his way past "Aunt Rock"--named for a much-loved Indian
goddess who is said to have disappeared and then reappeared in the
form of a rock--Hepburn treks up-canyon with the sure-footedness of
the native bighorn sheep.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he reaches a sycamore-shaded paradise where there
usually is a 60-foot waterfall. These days it's dry because of a
four-year drought. This tranquil oasis doubled as a mythical paradise
in Frank Capra's 1937 classic movie "Lost Horizon," starring Ronald
Colman and Jane Wyatt. In Capra's adaptation of James Hilton's
romantic fantasy of Shangri-La, the Himalayan paradise where no one
grows old, a film crew had to lift Wyatt's white horse to the top of
the falls with a winch.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon's blend of mythical malevolence and natural
beauty--even with the mercury stuck at 110--has been embraced by
writers, explorers and those who merely take delight in the outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   A nature writer, Joseph Smeaton Chase, encountered the canyon's
dark side in the early 1920s, when he heard things go bump in the
night. Sleeping with his ear to the ground, he was awakened by
"Tahquitz" making sounds like boulders crashing down from the
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Although he returned safely to write about his ordeal in "Our
Araby," a 1922 Palm Springs guidebook, others haven't been so lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Palm Springs mounted police search and rescue unit was
formed more than half a century ago, its members have pulled more
than 30 corpses from the canyon, some of them left after homicides,
others the remains of luckless hikers.</TE>
<TE>   Professional free spirit and songwriter Eden Ahbez found
unexpected fame after he sat down on a hot, sunny boulder and wrote
his autobiographical song "Nature Boy," which was popularized by Nat
King Cole in 1948. His bohemian ways later inspired flower children,
war veterans and the homeless to take up residence in the canyon's
caves.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, during spring break, thousands of teenagers flooded into
Palm Springs for a rock concert. Afterward, a rowdy crowd wound up in
the canyon, where they spent days skinny-dipping in the canyon's icy
pools and dancing on its boulders.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, police evicted them and slapped a "closed" sign on the
canyon. It stayed there for 30 years--until the Cahuillas built their
visitor center, cleaned up the canyon and reopened it last year for
guided hikes only.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon's mouth is right in Palm Springs, where Cahuilla
Indians built the Coachella Valley's first village more than 3,000
years ago. They called it Sekhi, which means "sound of boiling
water," for its natural hot springs. Today, the site is occupied by
the Spa Resort Casino, where health and wealth can be sought in
tandem.</TE>
<TE>   Other springs were discovered too, eventually giving the city its
name. Even after thousands of years, Sekhi remains the area's hottest
spring, at 104 to 106 degrees, according to Tribal Ranger Rocky
Toyama.</TE>
<TE>   Like its subject, the Tahquitz legend takes many forms. Some
versions credit Tahquitz with strewing boulders all over the
mountainside. The demon and an angry chief are said to have tossed
them at each other in a great duel.</TE>
<TE>   The way the Agua Caliente band of Cahuillas tells it, shaman
Tahquitz first practiced his healing art with good effect,
controlling the food supply and weather and curing disease by sucking
out the evil with his mouth and blowing it away.</TE>
<TE>   But gradually and mysteriously, evil seeped into his heart. He
began to wreak havoc on his people by causing illness and discomfort
and making the animals leave the canyon. Soon his name inspired fear.
For using his supernatural powers for harm rather than good, he was
banished from the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   Scaling the granite cliffs, he made his home in a cave at the far
end of the canyon, beneath a 1,000-foot boulder that eventually would
be called Tahquitz Rock by the Indians and Lily Rock by white
settlers in the town of Idyllwild. (Today, it is popular with rock
climbers, who prefer Tahquitz's fierce appellation.)</TE>
<TE>   Bitter and angry over his exile, Tahquitz became downright
dangerous. Emerging from his cave in various forms, he kidnapped and
killed young Indians, feeding on their souls. When he spotted the
beautiful maiden Cawisicela, whose name means "The Fox's Dress,"
swimming in an emerald pool, he was consumed with lust.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her cries for help, he carried her off to his mountain
hideaway. There he kept her for several months, forcing her to help
him consume souls until he could no longer endure her misery. But
before he set her free, he made her promise not to tell her people
what had happened until three years had passed. Returning to her
village, she was welcomed with open arms. As promised, she remained
mute about her ordeal--for a while. But after months of tribal
elders' badgering about what had happened, she broke down and
divulged her secret.</TE>
<TE>   That was a big mistake. Although she appealed for pity and mercy,
her tribesmen were appalled that she had become Tahquitz's "wife,"
even unwillingly, and had eaten the souls of their brothers.
Heartbroken and alone, she went to bed that night and died in her
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are many lessons to be learned from this legend,
Toyama distills it this way for schoolchildren: "Don't abuse your
power; use it wisely for the good of all others. When you make a
promise, keep it. And don't ever try to weasel a secret out of
someone, or something might happen to you."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has signed a bill by Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth
Jackson that requires shippers of crude oil between San Francisco and
Los Angeles to submit quarterly reports on how much oil they are
moving and the routes tankers take through the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   "With the Bush Administration fighting for greater control to
expand drilling for oil off California's coasts, we may sadly see
increased oil drilling and tankering off our fragile coast," Jackson
said in a written statement. "This bill will provide the state with
access to the information necessary to assess the impact and
potential risks of transportation of oil off our coast."</LD>
<LD>   The information will be used for planning purposes by the oil
spill response administrator in the California Department of Fish and
Game, the California Coastal Commission and the Air Resources Control
Board.</LD>

<HD>9/11 Reforms Will Restrict Freedoms, ACLU Chief Says</HD>
<DH>Law: After the attacks, the government's reach was
broadened. 'This is about nothing less than core American values,'
Anthony Romero says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Restrictions on civil liberties adopted after last year's terrorist
attacks could persist for many years, the executive director of the
American Civil Liberties Union said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is really about deciding what type of country we want to
live in," Anthony Romero said. "This is about nothing less than core
American values."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at the annual dinner of the Indiana Civil Liberties
Union, Romero said much of the public is unaware that some rules
enacted after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
set legal precedents.</LD>
<TE>   "Most are not going away until we make them go away," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the government has substantially
expanded its ability to investigate and detain citizens, including
giving itself the authority to hold people indefinitely without
charges and giving law enforcement easier access to Americans'
personal lives.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU plans to file lawsuits related to the reforms and hopes
to educate the public about the importance of civil liberties in
times of crisis, Romero said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no time to despair or to become hysterical," he said.
"This is the time and the place and the opportunity to carefully lay
the groundwork for an eventual swing of the pendulum."</TE>
<TE>   "What I want most is for the American public and elected
representatives to have a robust debate on issues. That debate has
largely not happened in the first year and is only beginning to
happen now."</TE>
<TE>   Last year the ACLU experienced the largest jump in membership in
its 82-year history, Romero said.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts are divided about the attacks' effect on civil
liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Garnett, an associate law professor at Notre Dame
University, said government leaders have shown restraint.</TE>
<TE>   "My view is that the civil liberties story after 9/11 is not all
the abuses and all the limitations, because I don't believe there
have been significant abuses or abridgments," Garnett said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Levy, a scholar at the Cato Institute, a Washington think
tank, said many new regulations may be unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just a number of areas where civil liberties have been
compromised too extensively," Levy said, "particularly given what
we've gotten in return."</TE>

<HD>Budget Bills Stall in Shadow of War</HD>
<DH>Politics: Congress has passed none of the 13 measures
needed by Oct. 1 to run the government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Even as Congress grapples with a potential war with Iraq and creation
of a new homeland security department, the nation's premier
deliberative body is making a hash of its more mundane but crucial
responsibility: That little matter of keeping the government
financed.</LD>
<LD>   The new federal budget year begins Oct. 1, but Congress has yet to
pass a single one of the 13 appropriation bills needed to keep
government agencies running. The expected result is a year-end
scramble that could end up adding billions to an already burgeoning
budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   The fiscal logjam is rooted, in part, in tried-and-true partisan
divisions. Democrats want to spend more, Republicans less. But there
are extra elements roiling the situation this year: bitter divisions
among Republicans and mixed signals from a White House increasingly
preoccupied with building the case for a war on Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush repeatedly has preached the gospel of fiscal
discipline, but he signed a $180-billion, 10-year farm bill early
this year which critics derided as a budget buster. He also has
conceded that budget deficits are acceptable in times of war and
recession. And on Capitol Hill, some are wondering whether Bush, as
he seeks to mobilize the nation and the world for an assault on Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, will want to spend political capital on
nickel-and-diming congressional appropriations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the White House has focused on this," said Rep.
David L. Hobson (R-Ohio), a senior member of the House Appropriations
Committee. "They are on to the big questions of whether to go to
war."</TE>
<TE>   If Bush does continue to lean on Congress to rein in spending, he
may clash with the political needs of fellow Republicans up for
reelection. Even true-believing fiscal conservatives can be found
supporting crowd-pleasing expenditures, like the $6 billion in
drought relief approved by the Senate last week with substantial
Republican support over Bush's objections.</TE>
<TE>   It adds up to cross pressures so complex that many lawmakers
predict Congress will throw up its hands before it adjourns for the
election campaign in mid-October--and put off major spending
decisions for a lame-duck session that convenes after the Nov. 5
vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I see no scenario where we can avoid a lame-duck session," said
Rep. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.), another member of the Appropriations
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   None of this means the government is going to run out of money or
be partially shut down, as it was in the 1995-96 budget battle
between President Clinton and congressional Republicans. When the
Oct. 1 deadline arrives, Congress will likely pass stopgap funding to
keep the government running until the 13 spending bills are passed.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the part of the budget over which Congress has the
most control--the programs financed by annual appropriations rather
than by the automatic funding provided for entitlements, such as
welfare and Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has proposed appropriating $759 billion for those
programs--up from $728 billion this year--for enterprises ranging
from military weapons to education aid. House Republican leaders are
trying to stick to Bush's overall figure, but members of both parties
on the House Appropriations Committee are angling for more. And the
Democrat-controlled Senate is on track to spend $768 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The process of actually allocating that money has been unusually
slow this year. So far, the House has passed only five of the 13
spending bills; the Senate has passed only three. None has been
finalized by House-Senate negotiations and sent to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Not since 1995, when budget disputes were so bitter they prompted
the partial government shutdown, has Congress run so far behind.</TE>
<TE>   Intra-GOP tensions have slowed action in the House, where
conservative Republicans who want to stick to Bush's budget are at
loggerheads with moderates seeking more for popular social programs.</TE>
<TE>   The big sticking point is the bill that finances the departments
of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education. Conservatives
refuse to vote for more than the $130 billion Bush has requested;
moderate Republicans--and Democrats--won't vote for a bill that does
not provide more. GOP moderates are pleading with their leaders that
under the Bush budget, college tuition grants, energy assistance and
other politically popular programs would be shortchanged, and
moderates won't endorse that, especially on the eve of an election.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some political realities," said Rep. Michael N. Castle
(R-Del.), who has led the GOP opposition to Bush's budget on the
Labor-HHS-Education bill. "The votes just aren't there. These are
issues most of the moderates care tremendously about."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's backlog on spending bills stems largely from partisan
divisions over priorities. The disputes have proved so intractable
that senators never passed an annual budget resolution--the broad
blueprint that traditionally sets guidelines for the 13 spending
bills that follow.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a budget, Senate Democrats have been free to add
more money than Bush requested for various programs, especially for
party favorites such as education aid.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate is spending with abandon," complained House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas). "They are spending like money is water."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not just Democrats who are defying Bush on spending
constraints. When the Senate passed the $6 billion for drought relief
last week, the vote was an overwhelming 79 to 16. The 15 Republicans
who voted for it included several senators up for reelection, as well
as stalwart conservatives, such as Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho).</TE>
<TE>   Republicans also helped enact the big farm bill passed this year,
which essentially repealed past GOP efforts to reduce farmers'
dependence on federal subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's budget advisors say they remain committed to holding the
line on the president's spending request. But to maintain that
stance, they will have to fight Congress' time-honored practice of
resolving year-end budget disputes by throwing money at the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The big challenge is to change the formula from spending your way
out of town to saving your way out of town," said Trent Duffy,
spokesman for Bush's Office of Management and Budget.</TE>
<TE>   Bush underscored his determination to hold the line on spending in
August, when he announced that he was refusing to spend $5.1 billion
of the $29 billion Congress approved in a midyear anti-terrorism
bill.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats argue that the administration has been spoiling for
a fight over relatively small amounts to shore up Bush's credentials
as a tight-fisted budgeteer.</TE>
<TE>   Those credentials have been tarnished, some analysts say, by an
uneven record of sticking by his frugal principles. Bush initially
proposed $190 billion over 10 years for a Medicare prescription drug
benefit; then the White House endorsed a $370-billion bill by House
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush signed the $180-billion farm bill, administration
officials said it would be cheaper than letting Congress continue to
pass annual farm bailout bills, as it had every year since 1996. But
critics said the bill was bloated and its enactment suggested Bush
was not serious about fiscal discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "It sends a mixed signal," said Hobson. "Everybody looks around
and says, 'Does he really mean it?' "</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>A Republican candidate for Congress is offering campaign volunteers
extra protection for their visits to immigrant neighborhoods: escorts
from the National Rifle Assn.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats said the offer by the campaign of incumbent Rep. Robert
"Robin" Hayes is an insult to residents, and they held a rally
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "A representative in Congress should not be afraid of the district
they represent," said Mecklenburg County Democratic Chairman John
Cotham, one of about 15 people who turned up in the rain to protest.
"That's the most insulting comment I've heard a politician ever make
about his constituents."</LD>
<TE>   In an e-mail sent Thursday to Republicans in the county about a
campaign gathering, Hayes' campaign managers said volunteers need not
fear.</TE>
<TE>   "NRA members will cover neighborhoods that might be uncomfortable
for some volunteers," the e-mail said.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes campaign manager Richard Hudson later conceded that the
message may have been insensitive, and he said he hoped the NRA
escorts would not be carrying guns.</TE>
<TE>   "I could understand, going back and reading it, that it could have
been worded better," Hudson said, adding that the campaign's main
concern is fast-moving traffic, not crime.</TE>
<TE>   An aide to Hayes' Democratic opponent, Chris Kouri, said Kouri's
volunteers have never had problems in Charlotte's low-to
middle-income eastern neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "We've knocked on doors in this neighborhood," said the aide, Paul
Blank. "We've had women and children go door to door too."</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers went without NRA escorts, he added.</TE>

<LD>Al Gore was trying Saturday to strengthen his ties with black
lawmakers, a constituency whose support he would need should he
decide to run for president in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Gore received the backing of 9 in 10 black voters in 2000, a rate
of support from blacks higher than his former boss, Bill Clinton, won
in either of his successful presidential elections.</LD>
<LD>   The former vice president was among speakers scheduled for
Saturday night's awards banquet at the Congressional Black Caucus
Foundation's annual legislative conference.</LD>
<TE>   "Al Gore is still the titular head of the Democratic Party," said
Rep. William J. Jefferson, a Louisiana Democrat who is chairman of
the nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation, a public policy and research
organization. "He is the best-known and most popular Democrat in the
country, second only to former President Clinton."</TE>
<TE>   The conference, which started Wednesday, has focused on a variety
of issues, including how to communicate about the United States more
effectively with less affluent nations.</TE>
<TE>   "The assault on Sept. 11 showed us we still need to reach out to
the people of the world," said Rep. Bobby L. Rush, the Illinois
Democrat who heads the conference. The group also dealt with domestic
concerns such as the economy, education and public health.</TE>
<TE>   Weldon Rougeau, the foundation president, said it is important
that the nation's political debate return from its heavy focus on
international concerns such as Iraq and terrorism to include domestic
issues crucial to the country.</TE>
<TE>   "We have put on hold many issues which are important to African
Americans and other Americans," Rougeau said.</TE>
<TE>   Conference leaders said they were eager to hear what Gore has to
say about them.</TE>
<TE>   Rush noted that the continuing election problems in the Florida
governor's race make it "very timely that Gore is here." Gore lost
the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush after a contentious
fight over voting problems in Florida's very close presidential
contest.</TE>
<TE>   Gore probably will get strong support from black voters if he runs
again, several at the conference said, but they will also take a
close look at other potential Democratic candidates.</TE>

<HD>Gore's Son Is Accused of DUI Outside Army Base in Virginia</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The 19-year-old son of former Vice President Al Gore has been
ticketed for allegedly driving under the influence near a military
base, a Gore family spokesman confirmed Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Albert Gore III, who attends Harvard University, was pulled over
and ticketed by military police early Sept. 5 just outside Ft. Myer
in northern Virginia, but he was not taken into custody.</LD>
<LD>   He is to appear in federal court later, a Ft. Myer spokesman told
the Daily News of New York.</LD>
<TE>   "The family is relieved that no one was hurt," said Gore family
spokesman Jano Cabrera.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond that they are dealing with the situation privately as a
family."</TE>
<TE>   The younger Gore was cited by the North Carolina Highway Patrol in
the summer of 2000 for driving 97 mph in a 55-mph zone.</TE>
<TE>   Under an agreement with prosecutors, a reckless driving charge was
dropped, but he was fined $125 for speeding and his driving
privileges in the state were suspended.</TE>

<HD>Gulf Coast Hit by Tropical Storm Hanna</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Tropical Storm Hanna blew ashore Saturday on the Gulf Coast, pouring
up to 4 inches of rain across coastal Alabama and the Florida
Panhandle and knocking out power with wind up to 50 mph.</LD>
<LD>   The storm quickly weakened as it spread inland into Georgia and
was downgraded to a tropical depression, with sustained wind down to
30 mph by late afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Alabama Gov. Donald Siegelman declared a state of emergency for
Mobile and Baldwin counties. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had declared a
state of emergency in all counties west of the Apalachicola River in
the Panhandle.</LD>
<TE>   The storm's center crossed the western end of Dauphin Island,
south of Mobile, during the morning, then hit the coast near the
Alabama-Mississippi line, said National Weather Service meteorologist
Randy McKee in Mobile.</TE>
<TE>   Power was out on Dauphin Island, some roads were underwater and
the causeway and bridge leading to the island were closed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a good many people who stayed on the west end of the
island and we had to evacuate some people from the west end," Dauphin
Island police officer G.T. Taylor said. He said no injuries or major
damage were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Tropical storm warnings were discontinued, but flood watches
remained in effect for southeastern Alabama, the Florida Panhandle,
southwestern and south-central Georgia and parts of South Carolina,
the weather service said.</TE>
<TE>   Hanna brought much needed rain to parched areas of southeastern
and south-central Alabama, but some of the storm's heaviest rainfall
was reported in the Florida Panhandle. Tallahassee had road flooding,
and fallen tree limbs and power outages were reported in the
Pensacola area.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, 20,000 homes and businesses were without power in
the Panhandle, Gulf Power Co. reported.</TE>
<TE>   Bridges linking the mainland to Perdido Key, west of Pensacola,
and Santa Rosa Island, south of the city, were temporarily closed
because of high wind, said Escambia County Emergency Management chief
Michael Hardin.</TE>
<TE>   By 4 p.m. CDT, Hanna was centered about 40 miles northeast of
Mobile, Ala., and was moving toward the northeast at about 12 mph. It
was expected to continue that course today and continue weakening,
the National Hurricane Center said.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers, meanwhile, were hoping for rain.</TE>
<TE>   "We need the rain desperately," said William Birdsong, regional
extension agronomist in southeast Alabama, where rainfall has been
below normal for several years.</TE>
<TE>   "We need the rain. There's no doubt about that," said Mayor James
Grimes in the town of Elba.</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Suspect Still in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Probe: U.S. agents reportedly helped officials locate
alleged plotter Ramzi Binalshibh before Karachi raid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON and SHAMIM UR-REHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>U.S. agents tracked a call on a portable satellite phone to find
alleged Al Qaeda member Ramzi Binalshibh, a lead suspect in the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, official Pakistani sources said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   FBI agents and officers of Pakistan's military intelligence
agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, were interrogating Binalshibh on
Saturday at a secret location in Pakistan, the sources said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistani Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider denied that FBI
agents had assisted in Binalshibh's arrest Wednesday, the first
anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the U.S., before an
hours-long battle with assault rifles and hand grenades erupted in an
upscale Karachi apartment building.</LD>
<TE>   The fierce firefight left two suspects dead and four members of
Pakistan's security forces seriously wounded.</TE>
<TE>   But Haider confirmed that Binalshibh and other Al Qaeda suspects
arrested during Wednesday's raid were still in Pakistan on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, they are still with us," he said in brief comments to
reporters. "They are not with police but the intelligence agency" --
a common reference to the ISI, a powerful and shadowy organization.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued Saturday, Pakistani authorities said they
had arrested about a dozen foreigners in separate raids, adding: "Two
out of those arrested are suspected to be high-level Al Qaeda men,
and their identity is being confirmed."</TE>
<TE>   Although the latest arrests are a significant breakthrough in the
battle against Al Qaeda terrorists operating in Pakistan, the ISI's
many critics have accused elements of the agency of secretly
protecting members of Osama bin Laden's network and its allies who
were part of Afghanistan's deposed Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   The raid to capture Binalshibh came just a few days after a
journalist with the Middle East satellite TV station Al Jazeera
reported that the Yemeni man had boasted about his role in the Sept.
11 attacks during a June interview at a secret location in Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry reacted to that by dismissing
suggestions that Al Qaeda leaders were regrouping in Karachi as "a
fabrication."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani police and intelligence agencies are coordinating their
anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S. "to bring peace globally,"
Haider said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "The world should help us in capability-building," he said,
apparently referring to technology enabling authorities here to
monitor cyber-crime and calls made from portable satellite phones.</TE>
<TE>   Haider hinted that Washington was moving quickly to have
Binalshibh extradited to stand trial. Germany had issued an
international warrant for his arrest less than two weeks after the
Sept. 11 attacks. He was a roommate of lead hijacker Mohamed Atta in
Hamburg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   German Interior Minister Otto Schily said Saturday that he would
ask for Binalshibh's extradition, Associated Press reported.</TE>
<TE>   German Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin said German
authorities would cooperate with other countries that might want
custody of Binalshibh, the AP report added.</TE>
<TE>   Haider appeared to say that his government would be willing to
send the terrorist suspects to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "many of these people, if they are wanted by the
U.S., we are obliged to share information, and if any of them is
wanted, according to U.N. convention, we are bound to hand them
over," Pakistan's interior minister said. "They [the U.S. government]
may have asked for [that]."</TE>
<TE>   Extradition is a sensitive political issue in Pakistan, where
President Pervez Musharraf's close cooperation with the U.S. in the
war on terrorism continues to make him many enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has so far refused to extradite British-born Ahmad Omar
Saeed Sheikh, a militant with Al Qaeda links who was sentenced to
hang in July for masterminding the kidnapping and murder of American
journalist Daniel Pearl. Sheikh and three accomplices are appealing
their convictions.</TE>
<TE>   When Ramzi Yousef, the chief suspect in the 1993 bombing of New
York's World Trade Center, was arrested in Pakistan two years later,
then-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto quickly sent him to the U.S. for
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Yousef, a master bomb-maker who is serving time in a federal
prison, had plotted to kill Bhutto even as the FBI was on his trail.
His uncle, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, is another suspected Sept. 11
conspirator and was with Binalshibh during the Al Jazeera television
interview. Investigators are trying to determine whether Mohammed is
still in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Yosri Fouda, the host of a monthly investigative journalism
program on Al Jazeera, said he got the interviews after Binalshibh
contacted him by fax and phone and told him to fly to Karachi, where
the reporter spent two days with Binalshibh and Mohammed.</TE>
<TE>   In an account of his time with the fugitive terrorists, published
Sept. 8 in Britain's Sunday Times newspaper, Fouda called Binalshibh
and Mohammed "the two master planners of 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   After riding to his June rendezvous blindfolded, on an
auto-rickshaw taxi, Fouda was dropped off at an apartment building
and led up to the fourth floor, where "Khalid led me into a virtually
empty flat," the Al Jazeera reporter wrote. "I counted five rooms on
both sides before he invited me into one of them. There, another
shock awaited me.</TE>
<TE>   "Ramzi Binalshibh, a 30-year-old Yemeni accused by the FBI of
involvement in the bombing of the USS Cole in October 2000, was
sitting on the floor surrounded by three laptops and five mobile
phones. Khalid and Ramzi both now have a $25-million bounty on their
heads."</TE>
<TE>   Fouda's account continued with a chilling wisecrack by Mohammed
that may have foretold his own fate: " 'Recognized us yet?' Khalid
joked as Ramzi shook my hand warmly. 'You will when your door is
knocked at by intelligence dogs,' Ramzi said."</TE>
<TE>   An Arabic-language Web site issued a thinly veiled threat against
Fouda on Saturday, implying that he might have had a role in the
arrest of the two Al Qaeda suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to indicate that if, God forbid, this news is
correct, this means there was a kind of treason that caused brother
Ramzi to fall into the hands of those infidels, which requires a
warning to all brothers," the statement said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. and EU Pursue a Deal on Extraditions</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The talks in Denmark also focus on issues such
as fighting crime and terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>COPENHAGEN</DL>
<LD>European Union justice ministers and U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
discussed a deal on extraditions in talks here Saturday that included
issues such as fighting crime and terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration is concerned that the lack of extradition
agreements with a number of EU countries, which object to the U.S.
use of the death penalty, could prevent it from bringing terrorist
suspects to face trial in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Ashcroft said EU and U.S. legal experts had made progress in the
early stages of the extradition talks, but EU diplomats said
Saturday's unprecedented discussions in Denmark had not been able to
fully debate the death penalty issue.</LD>
<TE>   "The issues are not simple, nor do I predict there will easily be
solutions.... Complex things require protracted, persistent and
persevering efforts," Ashcroft told a news conference after the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The EU pledged to work more closely with the United States after
the Sept. 11 attacks. But EU opposition to extradition in cases where
a U.S. conviction could mean the death penalty or life in prison
without parole for an EU citizen remains an obstacle to a blanket
deal between the bloc and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The EU opposes the death penalty, which is still imposed in many
U.S. states, including Texas, where President Bush was once governor.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying U.S. concerns is the fact that some of the 19 hijackers
in the Sept. 11 attacks--as well as recently captured suspect Ramzi
Binalshibh--had been based in Germany. The German government has
issued an arrest warrant for Binalshibh, captured last week in
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Dutch justice minister said the United States was
"very interested" in a Kurdish man who was arrested in Amsterdam last
week and is suspected of links to Al Qaeda. And Italy said Thursday
that it had arrested 15 people it linked to the terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   But Swedish Justice Minister Thomas Bodstrom said he and other EU
ministers had voiced concerns over the death penalty, the treatment
of Europeans held at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and
Washington's refusal to join the International Criminal Court.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was important for Europe to remain united in voicing
its concerns to prevent undermining civil liberties in what the
United States calls the "war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have said Washington may not be ready to offer
blanket guarantees to the EU on the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Germany, Portugal, Greece and Austria have told their EU partners
that they have constitutional problems with extradition.</TE>
<TE>   The EU also wants an agreement on legal cooperation with
Washington that could lead to joint investigations.</TE>

<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz said Saturday that Baghdad
would let U.N. weapons inspectors return only under a comprehensive
deal that would prevent a U.S. attack and lift crippling 12-year-old
sanctions.</LD>
<LD>   Aziz held a news conference to respond to President Bush's speech
to the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday. Bush said action
against Iraq would be inevitable unless the world body forced Baghdad
to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   "If there is a solution which maintains Iraq's sovereignty,
dignity and legitimate rights and prevents aggression, we are ready,"
Aziz said. But he said Iraq would prevent inspectors returning if
"there is no honest, balanced and credible formula that will take us
to the truth."</LD>
<TE>   He accused Washington and London of blocking efforts to resolve
the inspections issue.</TE>
<TE>   Aziz said he feared that if inspectors are readmitted, a crisis
over their activities could soon arise that the U.S. would exploit as
a pretext to attack.</TE>
<TE>   He cited the U.S.-British bombing campaign in December 1998 as an
example. The two Western allies attacked Iraq for four days during
that month for Iraq's alleged failure to cooperate with U.N. weapons
monitors. The inspectors left Iraq on the eve of that attack and have
not been allowed back.</TE>
<TE>   "We are facing the same situation as we faced in 1998. Continuous
accusations are being made in Washington and London," Aziz said.</TE>
<TE>   He said U.N. inspectors, responsible for accounting for any
weapons of mass destruction that Iraq might have, were in Iraq for 7
1/2 years but had found no prohibited weapons. "They made thousands
of inspections ... but they did not find anything."</TE>
<TE>   Aziz renewed an invitation to U.S. lawmakers to visit sites
suspected of producing weapons of mass destruction. "You can bring
all the experts ... and you can bring all the equipment you need to
search for the truth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also rejected Bush's charges that Baghdad is developing weapons
of mass destruction, harboring terrorist groups and posing a threat
to its neighbors. "Those accusations are a pretext to justify
unjustifiable aggression and invasion of Iraq," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aziz also denied any link with Al Qaeda but said there is a group
of Islamic extremists in the northern area of Sulaymaniyah--outside
the control of his government.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if they belong to Al Qaeda or not," he said.
Northern Iraq has been outside the Baghdad's control since soon after
the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Kurdish factions rule the region.</TE>
<TE>   Aziz said Washington wanted to attack his nation to control "the
riches of Iraq," a reference to oil.</TE>

<LD>   Harry helped design his coat of arms and incorporated an emblem--a
small red escallop--from his mother's family coat of arms.</LD>
<LD>   Testino, Princess Diana's favorite photographer, took birthday

<LD>An Iranian American folk dance teacher who was arrested when he
visited Iran in May has had a 10-year travel ban overturned by an
Iranian appeals court, his lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   Mohamad Khordadian's dances, which include women, landed him in
hot water in Iran, where they were broadcast via satellite TV and
were available on video. Mixed-sex dancing is forbidden in Iran.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyer said Khordadian, who lived in Los Angeles, was relieved
but had no plans to return to live in the U.S. He was arrested when
he visited Iran for the first time in more than 20 years and was
charged with promoting corruption by holding mixed-sex dance classes
in the U.S.</LD>

Russian police said.</LD>
<LD>   A police spokesman in Volgograd said the five--ages 6 to 9--went
to play in a ravine just outside the city Thursday and never
returned. Parents heard an explosion but did not pay attention, he
said. They sounded the alarm when the boys failed to come home.</LD>

<HD>Military Exercise Not Linked to Iraq, Britain Says</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Britain launched its biggest army exercise on home ground since 1998
on Saturday, but defense officials insisted that it was not a
saber-rattling trial run for war against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   In a test of their logistical skills, as many as 6,000 troops are
using 1,000 vehicles to transport thousands of tons of material and
equipment across the country.</LD>
<LD>   "Exercise Log Viper has started," a Defense Ministry spokesman
said. But he insisted: "It has nothing to do with Iraq."</LD>
<TE>   He said the four-week exercise has been planned for more than a
year. Army chiefs said the main aim of the test was "to provide the
opportunity to ensure we can feed, clothe and maintain supplies,
vehicles and weaponry when required."</TE>
<TE>   Despite assurances that the exercise had nothing to do with Iraq,
military experts said the warning to the Iraqi regime would be clear.</TE>
<TE>   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a staunch supporter of U.S.
policy on Iraq, faces resistance in his Labor Party to Britain
joining any U.S. attack on Baghdad.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Delegation Holds Talks With Iraqi Officials</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>A U.S. congressman, a former senator and two other Americans held
talks with Iraqi officials here Saturday, urging them to readmit U.N.
weapons inspectors but also saying that it would be immoral for
Washington to launch an attack without provocation.</LD>
<LD>   The visit by the delegation including Rep. Nick J. Rahall II
(D-W.Va.) and former Sen. James G. Abourezk (D-S.D.) marks the first
time in years that a sitting U.S. legislator has visited Iraq, which
has been under U.N. sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in 1990.</LD>
<LD>   "We are on a humanitarian mission ... not only to convince the
Iraqi people that the American people are concerned with their
suffering, but also to show that the American people, their vast
majority, are peace-waging individuals," Rahall said during a meeting
with Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz.</LD>
<TE>   "We feel very strongly that this open dialogue is much better than
going to any harsh military action that will only evoke more
suffering," Rahall said.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush told the U.N. last week that Iraq must grant access
to weapons inspectors or risk U.S. action. Iraq has barred inspectors
since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Abourezk criticized moves toward an attack on Iraq and said the
United States was being pushed toward war by Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "If America launched an attack on somebody without any provocation
and declaration of war, then it will lose its moral standards,"
Abourezk said. "Bush, pushed by Israel, is trying to build a case
against Iraq without evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Israel has accused Iraq of sponsoring terrorism by giving
financial support to the families of suicide bombers and trying to
smuggle weapons into Palestinian areas.</TE>
<TE>   Rahall said the return of inspectors would be a step toward peace,
but he declined to say whether such a move would put an end to Bush's
desire to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot speak on behalf of President Bush.... I am here as an
individual member of Congress who has questions," Rahall said.</TE>

<LD>   And so it came as little surprise when two SUVs packed with armed
men forced the outspoken journalist's car off the road in June. They
dragged him out screaming and shot him point-blank in the face.</LD>
<TE>   What was surprising was where the killing took place: between two
military checkpoints a few miles apart, according to witnesses.
Despite roadblocks and constant searches of vehicles, nobody was
caught in the June 28 killing.</TE>
<TE>   "The military and the paramilitaries here are the same," said one
of the people traveling with Varela when he was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Varela's slaying was the most recent indication of possible
cooperation between Colombia's violent right-wing paramilitaries and
soldiers in the 18th Brigade, the local army unit.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists have long documented collaboration between
the Colombian military and the paramilitaries, who share a common
enemy in the nation's leftist guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   But a link between the 18th Brigade and paramilitaries, if proven,
would be serious, because the U.S. is planning to embark on an
ambitious program over the next several years to train soldiers in
the brigade.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. aid to Colombia is supposed to be suspended if the Colombian
military does not aggressively pursue the paramilitaries, who are
listed as terrorists by the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attacks on Pipeline</TE>
<TE>   The 18th Brigade is responsible for providing protection for an
oil pipeline jointly owned by Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum
and the Colombian state oil company. Colombia's leftist rebels
unleashed a wave of attacks against the pipeline last year, but the
number of strikes has since diminished.</TE>
<TE>   The 18th Brigade was most recently cleared of human rights
violations in June. And last week, the State Department certified
that the Colombian military as a whole was actively combating
paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), head of the Foreign Operations
subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, protested the
certification, saying he was concerned about reports of links between
the brigade and the paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not want to repeat the experience of El Salvador, when we,
in effect, provided training and equipment to death squads," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. proposal in Arauca is similar to aid provided to El
Salvador during the 1980s, when U.S. troops trained Salvadoran
military units to fight that country's leftist guerrillas. Some of
those units were later accused of committing massacres and torture.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has proposed spending $98 million to fund new
helicopters, increased intelligence sharing and training for the
estimated 7,000 men in the brigade. The proposal is the first time
that U.S. money will go directly to help the Colombian army in its
nearly 40-year-old battle with the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a corrupted force, and now [the U.S.] is going to make it
stronger," said Jose Murillo, a local human rights worker.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other Incidents Reported</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups say they have information on several other
incidents of selective killings that took place within a few hundred
yards of police or military posts.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Angel Riveros was killed in the town of Tame by
heavily armed men who somehow passed through a military checkpoint.
Riveros was a key witness in a case in which the military has been
accused of dropping a bomb on the town of Santo Domingo, killing 18
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been cases in which the two groups seem to have
closely coordinated movements. Witness for Peace, a left-leaning
activist group, documented a case this year in which a paramilitary
squad entered a town only days after the departure of an 18th Brigade
unit. The paramilitaries had free rein for a month, leading to eight
disappearances. They left days before the unit returned.</TE>
<TE>   But Colombian prosecutors insist that they are aggressively
investigating charges of collaboration between the two groups. They
are reviewing scores of allegations of human rights violations
against the 18th Brigade, but so far have found no evidence of a link
between the army and paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been nothing. Put that in big letters," said one of
those working with a special task force of prosecutors investigating
the charges in Arauca.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Carlos Lemus, whose record as a commander of the 18th Brigade
contains no history of human rights violations, said there is no
proof that any of his men has ever worked with paramilitaries. The
army has killed at least nine paramilitary fighters in battle this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "The accusations of [cooperation with paramilitaries] are totally
unfounded," Lemus said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, during interviews, paramilitary leaders displayed an
uncanny knowledge of military operations. Comandante Mario, leader of
a local squad, told two anecdotes--the killing of several Colombian
soldiers in Venezuela and the planting of a bomb inside the
Occidental compound--that are not widely known outside local military
circles.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, his men have been able to move freely through Arauca
in the past months, possible only by using heavily guarded local
roads during the seasonal flooding that fills the marshy prairies of
eastern Colombia this time of year.</TE>
<TE>   Comandante Freddy, a paramilitary squad leader, said at a
paramilitary roadblock about 15 miles from battalion headquarters
that his men must flee whenever the army comes in sight.</TE>
<TE>   "The army is apart from us, and we're different from the army," he
said as he lounged at the crossroads with about three dozen men.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, there are some sectors that share our beliefs."</TE>

<HD>Some Feeling Fenced In by Israel's Planned Wall</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Voices on both sides criticize project to separate
the Jewish nation from West Bank.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MAALEH SHOMRON, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Brenda Glikson, who lives in this Jewish settlement on the West
Bank's western edge, is worried because her house won't be inside the
perimeter. Farmer Eid Ahmad Yassin, who lives in the Palestinian
village of Al Ras a few miles north, is worried because his fields
will be.</LD>
<LD>   Even though construction has only started, Israel's $100-million
"separation wall" between the Jewish nation and the West Bank already
divides people.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say it is an ill-conceived boondoggle that won't provide
security even as it threatens to worsen hostilities. Supporters say
it's the only way to guarantee security and keep Palestinian
extremists from killing Israeli civilians.</LD>
<TE>   Both sides agree on one thing, however: It's going ahead, whether
it will be effective or not. The pressure to do
something--anything--in the face of dozens of suicide bomb attacks
inside Israel is just too great.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an express train leaving the station," said Danny
Seidman, an attorney representing Palestinians who will be displaced
by the project. "It's become an Israeli mantra."</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for the completion of the first 66-mile segment of the
proposed 300-mile north-south barrier by next July, with immediate
priority given to a six-mile stretch near the West Bank cities of
Jenin and Nablus. Separately, evacuation orders have been issued to
Palestinian residents along a 32-mile route on the edge of Jerusalem.
It's unclear whether or how the two barriers will be joined.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of Israelis surveyed have embraced the wall proposal as
a counterweight to their growing feelings of vulnerability and
desperation.</TE>
<TE>   Security experts say, however, that throwing up some concrete,
barbed wire, sensors and lights is no panacea. "For one thing, most
suicide bombers come through checkpoints," not lonely borders, said
Efraim Inbar, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic
Studies, a think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Others say that walls are effective only if they're backed up by
shoot-on-sight policies, as seen with the Iron Curtain.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't exactly think that would improve our PR image," said
Israel Medad, a member of the Yesha Council, the umbrella group
representing Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. "And no
fence can prevent incursions by a Kassam rocket."</TE>
<TE>   Although the barrier won't prevent extremists from getting
through, experts argue, it could institutionalize the divide between
ordinary people on both sides who are arguably the best long-term
hope for peace.</TE>
<TE>   "The long-term signal is that there won't be economic interaction
in the future between Israelis and Palestinians," said Mark Heller,
an analyst at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   It also threatens to destroy the livelihood of Palestinian
farmers--some of whose land has been in their families for
decades--thereby risking greater militancy among moderates.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Israeli military officials estimate that 11,000
Palestinians and 20,000 Arab residents of Jerusalem will be
displaced. Palestinian cartographer Khalil Tufakji charges that the
wall's deviations from the so-called Green Line will absorb 30 square
miles of Palestinian land. The Green Line marks the pre-1967 border
that divides Israel and the West Bank territories and is seen by many
as the basis for any future political settlement between Israel and
the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "This project will destroy Palestinian economies and the heritage
of these villages," Tufakji said.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, say the project is workable. Nothing is
impenetrable, acknowledged Nezah Mashiah, the project's director in
the Israeli Defense Ministry, but he pointed to the effectiveness of
his other handiwork: the barrier he helped build around the Gaza
Strip, home to more than 1 million Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Mashiah conceded that most suicide bombers come through
checkpoints, but he argued that new transit stations with metal
detectors and airport-like security will end this. Every effort is
being made to avoid upending lives, he said; houses won't be
destroyed, although greenhouses and farm structures might.</TE>
<TE>   Even Mashiah admits he's not a big fan of the wall because it
signals a fundamental breakdown between the two sides. But he argues
that his creation could be quickly torn down if there's a political
breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   "For genuine peace," he said, "$100 million is nothing."</TE>
<TE>   One of the project's most visible early results has been to turn
thousands of Palestinians and Israelis into amateur surveyors.</TE>
<TE>   The wall has been diverted to include settlements--controversial
developments built in the West Bank on land the Palestinians claim as
their own--that are located within a few miles of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Glikson, of the 180-family Maaleh Shomron settlement, which will
fall outside the wall by a few miles, believes that the project is a
slap in the face to those excluded.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes us feel like we're second-class citizens," she said. "If
you're going to have a fence, bring us back to Israel and rebuild our
houses there. This is a de facto border."</TE>
<TE>   Nor, she believes, is it workable. Maaleh Shomron's suburban
driveways, landscaping and ample lots have been guarded and fenced in
from neighboring Arab villages for years but still suffer regular
incursions--not by so-called terrorists but by thieves, she says.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away, Palestinian farmer Yassin, the father of five,
stands to lose several acres. And his village will lose 95% of its
olive groves and fields, which fall on the Israeli side, even as its
residents are left on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israelis aren't thinking of their security," Yassin said.
"They only want to take our land. If they want to build a wall, fine,
but build it on the Green Line, not here."</TE>
<TE>   The village has filed complaints, so far to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Ministry officials counter that the divide is being built
only for security, does not represent a political divide and isn't
meant to absorb Palestinian lands. Palestinian villagers will be able
to pass through "farmer's gates" to till fields, the ministry claims,
contingent on their not abusing these rights.</TE>
<TE>   Mashiah outlines the project with an engineer's precision: first a
barbed-wire fence to warn those who inadvertently come too close,
followed by a ditch or wall, a road for troops to patrol, a lighted
fence, a sensor-filled tracking path, a second road for patrols,
another sensor track and finally a barbed-wire fence on the other
side. Total width: 165 feet. Total height: at least 11 feet, rising
to 26 feet in places where the two populations are close together.</TE>
<TE>   For Mahmoud Turani, a 70-year-old baker who's lived in a
three-story house in East Jerusalem since 1973, the timing couldn't
be worse. His family plunked down $110,000 to expand its property
westward a few months before the wall was announced, land that will
now be used for the barrier.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our life's savings," Turani said, his skin wrinkled by
years of Mideast sun. "We sold my wife's jewelry, our musical
instruments, everything, and now this happens. The whole world is
going crazy."</TE>
<TE>   The military counters that all those facing expropriation--the
vast majority of them Palestinian--will be compensated at fair market
rates. But for most Palestinians, negotiating with Israel and
accepting payment for land is politically treacherous because it
amounts to selling out your future state and recognizing Israel's
authority over the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't accept compensation," said Mohammed Hinini, 65, who
lives next to the proposed route of the East Jerusalem wall. "This is
our homeland."</TE>
<TE>   Even if they did agree to sell, issues of so-called fair market
value are problematic on both sides. Rawhi Bashiti, 37, Hinini's
neighbor and owner of an auto body shop, says area land values fell
90% almost as soon as the project was announced. Settlement resident
Glikson says she doubts she could find a buyer for her house now.</TE>
<TE>   Since the project was announced in June, the military has been
besieged with requests to alter its course, even as it tries to find
a way to balance security and those directly affected.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli community of Matan has mounted one of the most vocal
protests despite the fact that it will be wholly inside the planned
wall. Residents blocked a nearby highway, besieged the Defense
Ministry and launched a major publicity campaign. Their fear is that
the wall's path would allow two nearby Arab communities to merge,
creating what it claims would be a "harbor for terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials say privately that non-Palestinian groups with
well-organized protests probably will get their way. With political
clout the only hope of redirecting the wall, however, Palestinian
groups don't expect much of a hearing. Nor do the courts provide much
hope, they add, given that eviction orders fall under military rather
than civilian jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Voices on both sides say the wall is tangible evidence of weak
political leadership on both sides even as it raises deeper questions
about who's being fenced in and who's being fenced out.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only does a wall physically restrict the Palestinians," said
Suhad Bishara, an attorney with the nongovernmental Legal Center for
Arab Minority Rights. "It also acts as a mental and psychological
barrier for the Israeli population. Living in situations where you're
surrounded by walls doesn't calm the situation. It only makes it
worse."</TE>
<TE>   As Bashiti's eyes drifted over the East Jerusalem hills where he
grew up, played hide-and-seek as a kid and held many mutton cookouts
with friends, he added: "All we can do is hope things work out in the
long run. Who knows? It took 40 years, but eventually people tore
down the Berlin Wall with their bare hands."</TE>

<HD>Boeing Machinists' Strike Vote Falls Short</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>A strike vote by Boeing Co.'s largest union failed, averting a
walkout at the world's largest aircraft maker.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the machinists union had urged members to approve the
strike, saying they had grave concerns about job security. But only
61% of the members voted in favor of the walkout, short of the
necessary two-thirds.</LD>
<LD>   The union represents 25,000 workers in Washington state; Wichita,
Kan.; and Portland, Ore. It held the vote Thursday and Friday, and
announced the results Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, workers at Boeing's suburban Philadelphia helicopter
plant went on strike early Saturday for the first time in 28 years
after last-minute contract talks failed to produce an agreement
before a midnight deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials met with negotiators for Local 1069 of the
United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of
America, but no agreement was reached covering the approximately
1,400 workers.</TE>
<TE>   The machinists union voted on two questions: whether to approve
Boeing's contract offer, made Aug. 27, and whether to strike. Union
bylaws dictate that unless two-thirds of members vote to strike, a
contract offer is automatically accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Members said the key sticking point was job security--an
especially sensitive point over the last year. After the Sept. 11
attacks, which devastated the airline industry, Chicago-based Boeing
slashed production and announced it would lay off 30,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   The layoffs claimed 25% of the union's membership.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Mulally, head of Boeing's commercial airplane division, said
things could get tougher for the company.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing may have to further cut production, and possibly jobs,
because U.S. airlines haven't recovered as quickly as expected, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The machinists had been working without a contract since Sept. 1,
when their three-year agreement expired. The average wage under the
old contract was about $50,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The new contract includes an 8% ratification bonus, wage increases
of 2% and 2.5% in the second and third years, and a 20% boost in
monthly pension payments by the third year.</TE>
<TE>   The contract increases health-care costs for many employees. But
the biggest concerns for union leaders were what they described as
attacks on job security. Boeing refused to tie employment levels to
aircraft deliveries or other indicators of the industry's health.</TE>
<TE>   According to the union, a strike would cost members an estimated
$28.1 million in pay each week, with the majority of the damage in
Washington's Puget Sound region.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people are good people, but they're caught in a tough
situation," said Mark Blondin, president of the union's Seattle-based
District 751.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Downplays Worries Over Cuba Trip</HD>

<LD>Gov. Jesse Ventura says he has enough world experience to avoid being
used for propaganda purposes by Cuban President Fidel Castro when he
visits the Communist-run island this month for an agricultural
exposition.</LD>
<LD>   "For these people that think I'm some babe in the woods, heading
to Cuba, and would be totally ... transfixed or misled by Castro,
guess again," Ventura said.</LD>
<LD>   The trip has been condemned by the U.S. State Department and by
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose state is home to many anti-Castro Cuban
Americans.</LD>
<TE>   "I know what it's like to be under the rule of a dictator,"
Ventura said, describing his Navy years in the early 1970s when he
watched Ferdinand Marcos exercise dictatorial powers in the
Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   "When Marcos declared martial law, you didn't hear a peep out of
the United States. Why? Because he was a puppet to us.... As long as
we pulled his strings, it seems, we're OK with him."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The hushed-up hospitalization of Rep. Patsy T. Mink, 74, has caused a
slight stir, although the Democrat is expected to win reelection.</LD>
<LD>   Mink's hospitalization Aug. 30 was kept secret for a week, until
her office acknowledged she was suffering from viral pneumonia
resulting from a case of chicken pox.</LD>
<LD>   Mink has no need to campaign for Saturday's primary, as she faces
only token opposition. She also has long been considered a sure
winner in the general election in a state that has been under strong
Democratic control since shortly after statehood in 1959.</LD>
<TE>   Her leading Republican challenger this year, state Rep. Bob
McDermott, and her Democratic primary challenger Steve Tataii both
said they were holding back any criticism of Mink and hoped she
quickly recovers.</TE>

<HD>As Florida Sorts Out Primary Glitches, McBride Campaigns</HD>
<DH>Election: Search for missed votes continues, but the
unofficial winner of Democratic contest says it's time to get past
the balloting fiasco and work on unseating Gov. Jeb Bush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Workers waded through stacks of voting machines Saturday, pulling
them out one by one in a search for uncounted votes from Florida's
disputed Democratic gubernatorial primary.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, leading candidate Bill McBride was back on the
campaign trail, saying it was time to get past the primary election
fiasco and work on unseating Gov. Jeb Bush.</LD>
<LD>   McBride spoke to a raucous crowd of about 200 chanting, "Bill!
Bill! Bill!" at a Florida Education Assn. meeting in Orlando.</LD>
<TE>   "What we've got is a party I think is ready to unite and a party
that's ready to get on with the business at hand, and the business at
hand is defeating the current governor," McBride said.</TE>
<TE>   But former U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, who trailed McBride by
8,196 votes in unofficial totals from Tuesday's primary, said the
business at hand is counting all the votes--including thousands that
may have been missed in her South Florida strongholds of Broward and
Miami-Dade counties.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want the votes to be counted," Reno said on NBC's "Today"
show. "I'm happy to concede when the votes are there."</TE>
<TE>   Reno didn't fault McBride for starting to campaign against Bush,
who has run negative campaign ads about McBride.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were Bill, I'd be campaigning now," she said. "I'm not
stopping anybody."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, state election officials rejected Reno's request for a
statewide recount. But counties are allowed to amend the vote totals
due Tuesday to the state, so any votes that are found before then can
still count.</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday, candidates have 10 days to challenge the results
in court, although Reno has said she doesn't plan a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she is hoping counties find votes that went uncounted
because of technical problems. So far, Miami-Dade County has found
more than 1,800 such votes and is searching for perhaps thousands
more.</TE>
<TE>   In a dimly lighted warehouse in Medley, about 25 workers searched
through hundreds of stacked machines--which look like hard-sided
suitcases--looking for equipment from precincts where totals have
been questioned.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the machines were mislabeled, further slowing the
process. Workers had collected votes from 11 machines by Saturday
evening and had gathered other machines to download the voting
information.</TE>
<TE>   "We are relabeling as we go, so when I get the next list, it may
be easier to find them," said Emil Phillips Jr., an assistant
elections director in charge of systems.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-Dade officials would not release details about their vote
review until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Broward County, workers were examining more than 20 machines.
Officials would not say how many they wanted to check.</TE>
<TE>   Although McBride agreed that every vote should be counted, he said
the Democrats should not get distracted with the general election
less than two months away.</TE>
<TE>   "We've waited a hard couple of days, because what I wanted to do
is to make sure that we didn't get out ahead of ourselves," he said.
"We've got to start now.... We can't lose any more time."</TE>
<TE>   The election woes reminded many of the five weeks it took to
straighten out the 2000 presidential election in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The state and counties spent millions on technology to prevent a
repeat of the debacle with paper ballots, but the high-tech equipment
caused new difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, accepting the endorsement of retired police officers on
Saturday, rejected any claims that GOP state leaders were trying to
plot against Reno.</TE>
<TE>   "We will follow the law. We can't have a manual statewide recount,
as Ms. Reno has suggested," he said. "She, as a former attorney
general and former state attorney, ought to know what the law is
before she goes off and asks for these things."</TE>

<HD>Hottest Summer Since Dust Bowl, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With nearly half the country reeling from a blistering drought, this
summer is the hottest since the depression-stricken Dust Bowl era of
the 1930s, government weather experts said.</LD>
<LD>   The summer's scorching temperatures have sparked raging forest
fires in the West, wilted crops in the Midwest and parched pastures
in the Plains.</LD>
<LD>   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Friday
that the average temperature for the contiguous United States from
June through August was 73.9 degrees, the third-hottest summer since
record-keeping began in 1895. Summer officially ends Sept. 22.</LD>
<TE>   The only warmer summers were in 1934 and 1936, when vast numbers
of farmers were driven from their land by drought.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very extraordinary to have the warmest summer since the
1930s Dust Bowl days," said Douglas LeComte, a drought specialist at
NOAA.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. economy is no longer as dependent on agriculture
as it was in the 1930s, a major drought two years ago caused damage
worth $4 billion and claimed 140 lives nationwide. That summer in
2000 was only the 12th warmest on record.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the total costs of this year's drought are not presently
known, the drought diminished water supplies ... and contributed to
an active wildfire season and extremely difficult farming
conditions," NOAA said.</TE>
<TE>   Moderate to extreme drought now covers more than 45% of the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Six states--North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and
Nevada--are suffering their worst droughts on record, NOAA said.
South Carolina, Maryland, Georgia, Delaware and Wyoming also are near
unprecedented dry levels.</TE>
<TE>   NOAA predicted that the direct loss of this year's drought would
be in the billions of dollars.</TE>

<HD>Soldiers Repay Debt to Vietnamese Allies</HD>
<DH>War: U.S. troops promised to help the Montagnard fighters
who guided them into battle. After 27 years, 900 are resettled in
N.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The promise was made long ago, in the central highlands of wartime
Vietnam, and for many years it remained unfulfilled, though not
forgotten. "Don't worry," the Green Berets had told their Montagnard
allies. "We're going to come back for you." Then the war ended, the
U.S. Special Forces went home, and time passed.</LD>
<LD>   Now, in an echo of a war that ended 27 years ago, former Green
Berets who once manned a lonely string of outposts along the
Cambodian and Laotian borders are making good on their word, helping
900 Montagnards who ran afoul of the Hanoi government resettle in
North Carolina. The group consists of what might be the last refugees
with roots to a decade-long struggle the Vietnamese call the American
War.</LD>
<LD>   "They kept a whole lot of us alive," former Staff Sgt. Tom Hinton
said of the mountain tribesmen he fought with at the Duc Lap Special
Forces camp. "They were generous, unselfish, brave, wonderful
woodsmen. You didn't find Americans walking point [the lead soldier
on a patrol] when they went out with the Montagnards. They walked
point and they'd take a bullet for you. We just really loved them. I
feel like we're repaying a debt."</LD>
<TE>   The Montagnards--a generic term (pronounced mon-TAN-yard) for
Vietnam's minority hill tribes--are widely remembered today for
having fought for the Americans and against communism. But in
reality, having been exploited by French colonialists, abused by
South Vietnam and betrayed by North Vietnam, they fought for
themselves and their unlikely dream of an autonomous homeland in the
Central Highlands.</TE>
<TE>   The price they paid was catastrophic: one of every three of the
million or so Montagnards was a casualty of war; 80% of Montagnard
villages were destroyed or abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Hor Nay, 60, arrived in Raleigh with the group of 900 refugees in
July. He brought his wife, a son and one possession: a scrapbook with
grainy black-and-white photos. One shows him as a young man, dressed
in fatigues and holding an M-2 carbine; another, a group of smiling
Special Forces soldiers who tower over Nay and whose names he has now
forgotten. There is one of him and his bride in a bunker--the bunker
was their home--on the perimeter of a jungle outpost while an
American hunkers nearby, cleaning his rifle.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my last home, America," said Nay, who works as a janitor
for $8.50 an hour and displays a small U.S. flag on a bookcase in his
apartment. "If I can die peacefully here, I have no regrets. I will
always have a place in my heart for the Special Forces because
they're the only ones who came to the highlands and made promises
they did not break."</TE>
<TE>   Nay was sentenced to a reeducation camp after the war for fighting
on the side of the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In a two-bedroom unit near his, in the drab Palms Apartments, the
four Montagnards who came to Raleigh with Nay on this summer's
airlift are too young to have fought in the war. But Hanoi denounced
them, and many others, for "undermining national security" after
their participation in a protest in Pleiku over land and human rights
19 months ago. They fled to Cambodia in fear for the lives.</TE>
<TE>   Like his friends, Siu Prang, 22, speaks no English. He works the
night shift at a hospital, cleaning floors. He has never before lived
in a house with a toilet, running water or mattresses on the beds.
The microwave oven and television are a wonderment. There is an
electric rice cooker on the kitchen counter and his shoes and those
of his roommates are lined up in a neat row by the front door. He
still feels a bit bewildered, having made the transition from a
primitive jungle existence in a Cambodian refugee camp to a life in
urban America so quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "After the demonstration, Vietnam sent troops into the village
looking for us," he said through an interpreter. "There were beatings
and jailings. We had no choice but to escape to Cambodia. Life has
gotten impossible in the highlands. It is our land but Vietnam wants
to take it from us. Problems between us and the Vietnamese are not
new."</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Montagnards joined the three-day protest in Pleiku
and Buon Ma Thuot in February 2001, making it the largest public
demonstration in Vietnam since the war's end. At the core of the
unrest was that the Montagnards--a people culturally, linguistically
and, with their darker skin, physically different from the ethnic
Vietnamese majority--had run headlong into globalization.</TE>
<TE>   With the price of coffee soaring on the world market, Hanoi has
encouraged the migration and settlement of Vietnamese in the
highlands. They have cut down the forests, torn up farmland and
planted acre upon acre of robusta coffee. The plantations have turned
Vietnam into the world's third-largest coffee exporter, after Brazil
and Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   As unequal partners through history, the Montagnards established a
military wing in the mid-1960s known as FULRO. Its targets were
Vietnamese, whether from the North or the South. It carried out armed
resistance in the highlands until 1984 and was not disbanded until
1992. Most of its members, thanks in part to assistance from former
Special Forces soldiers and church groups such as Lutheran Family
Services, now live in North Carolina, where 4,000 Montagnards
constitute the largest such ethnic population outside Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still nostalgic for my homeland and we still struggle for
Montagnard rights but in a different way now, in a peaceful way,"
said Nay Rong, a former FULRO commander who came to Raleigh in 1986.
"We work through human rights groups. We try to let the world know
the Montagnards are not treated fairly.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us have been in the U.S. for 15 years now. We have decent
jobs, we own homes, our children go to college. What's amazing
through all this is that the Special Forces never forgot us. They
pressured Congress to bring us here. They helped us with language,
helped us find jobs and a place to live. They did everything for us."</TE>
<TE>   Hanoi's reaction to the unrest in the highlands was not entirely
surprising, given the government's fixation with stability,
like-minded attitudes and national unity.</TE>
<TE>   The government said the protesters' stories were fabricated and
blamed the demonstrations on "foreign agents." Without referring to
him by name, Hanoi meant Kok Ksor, who came to the United States in
1975 and is president of the Montagnard Foundation in Spartanburg,
S.C.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't get money from the U.S. government or any government and
we're not trying to overthrow Hanoi," Ksor said in a telephone
interview. "It's only about freedom and human rights. But our people
in the highlands are looking for support and that's why they asked me
for some ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Former Special Forces officers with intimate knowledge of the
Montagnard community said Ksor laid the foundation for the protests
with several meetings his supporters held in Dac Lac Province in late
2000 and early 2001. His plan, they said, was to create a
semi-permanent refugee population in Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   "Kok Ksor plays to the Montagnards' dreams and they sign on
because he's the only one promising them anything," said Carl Regan,
a former Green Beret who spent six months last year teaching English
in the two Cambodian camps, Mondolkiri and Rattanakiri, where the 900
protesters sought refuge under U.N. protection.</TE>
<TE>   Cambodia agreed in March to let the United States process the 900
refugees for resettlement in North Carolina. It burned Mondolkiri to
the ground an hour after the Montagnards left and closed Rattanakiri.
The border was sealed and Cambodia said no more Montagnards would be
allowed to cross into its territory.</TE>
<TE>   "My running away is finished," said Yuan Rmah, 21, one of the
Montagnards holed up with three roommates in Raleigh. "I called my
family when I got here and told them I was in the United States. They
were amazed. They asked me where I got enough rice to eat. I told
them in the supermarket."</TE>

<HD>Many Promises, Few Plans on Social Security</HD>
<DH>Politics: Candidates from both parties profess commitment
to stabilizing the system. But voters get almost no hint about how
they would accomplish it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Increasing Social Security's reliance on the stock market and
reducing guaranteed benefits for the elderly. Rolling back the next
stages of President Bush's tax cut and transferring trillions of
dollars in general government revenue into the Social Security
system.</LD>
<LD>   These are likely implications of the principal Republican and
Democrat proposals to improve the long-term solvency of the nation's
giant public pension program. But voters this fall would be more
likely to hear House and Senate candidates confess to a crime than
admit to any of that.</LD>
<LD>   As Social Security attracts increasing attention in the 2002
campaign, candidates from both parties are professing their
commitment to stabilizing the system. But they are offering voters
almost no hint about how they would actually accomplish that.</LD>
<TE>   "It is an abysmal display going on out there," said Michael
Tanner, director of the Project on Social Security Choice at the
libertarian Cato Institute here. "We are having demagoguery on one
side and cowardice on the other. Democrats attack a caricature of
privatization and the Republicans run away."</TE>
<TE>   Against the backdrop of the falling stock market, GOP candidates
are downplaying their longtime support for proposals to allow workers
to invest part of their payroll taxes in stocks and bonds, the
centerpiece of Bush's agenda for restructuring the program. A
handful, such as Rep. Charles W. "Chip" Pickering of Mississippi,
have gone further and renounced the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, while loudly condemning GOP proposals for private
accounts, have been much fainter in describing their own
ideas--partly because the most popular Democratic alternative for
strengthening Social Security almost inevitably would require the
party to challenge Bush's tax cut, which few candidates this year are
willing to do.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Democratic candidates are taking the offensive
on Social Security. They are betting heavily that concern about
sagging stock prices will turn senior citizens and near-retirees
against the notion of linking Social Security more closely to the
markets through individual investment accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be ads on Social Security in every single race," said
Jim Jordan, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But some Republicans are trying to turn the tables, attacking
Democrats for Clinton-era proposals that would have had the
government directly invest surplus Social Security funds in the stock
market. And in many places, Republicans are accusing Democrats of
ducking the program's long-term problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to put my head in the sand" on the issue, said Rep.
Lindsey O. Graham, the GOP Senate nominee in South Carolina, during a
recent appearance with his Democratic opponent, Alex Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-1990s, individual accounts have been the centerpiece
of GOP thinking on Social Security. Bush stressed the idea in his
2000 presidential campaign; last fall, a commission he appointed
proposed three alternatives that would let workers divert about
one-sixth to one-third of the 12.4% they now pay in Social Security
payroll taxes into private accounts they could invest themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and other Republicans have long argued that such accounts
would provide workers with more control over their retirement and
allow them to accumulate wealth by tapping into the stock market's
historically higher rate of return.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of Democrats have opposed such private accounts
on the grounds it would shift more of the risk for funding retirement
from government to workers, who could be caught short if their
investment accounts lose money. Because the GOP plans would divert
part of the payroll taxes now used to pay benefits into the
investment accounts, almost all of the proposals would reduce the
guaranteed benefit for retirees under Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   These arguments have been simmering between the parties since the
mid-1990s. But they acquired new urgency this year amid the growing
concern about retirement security sparked by corporate scandals and
the stock market's decline.</TE>
<TE>   This year's disputes over Social Security start with an argument
about what qualifies as privatization.</TE>
<TE>   For years, advocates on both sides of the debate have commonly
used the term "partial privatization" to describe proposals that
divert part of the payroll tax into individual accounts.</TE>
<TE>   But last spring, the National Republican Congressional Committee
distributed an e-mail urging GOP candidates to resist using the term
"privatization," arguing that it "carries connotations of dismantling
the publicly run Social Security system." Now, for instance, Rep.
Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia is running ads saying she will
"oppose privatization," though she says she is open to creating
private investment accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Norm Coleman, the GOP challenger to Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone
in Minnesota, and Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the GOP nominee for an open
Senate seat in North Carolina, also have said they oppose
privatization, though they support individual investment accounts.</TE>
<TE>   In a variation, Sen. Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.), who is seeking
reelection, and Rep. John R. Thune, the GOP Senate nominee in South
Dakota, have run ads in which they pledge to defend Social Security
but do not mention their longtime support for creating individual
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "You have only 30 seconds in an ad," says Christine Iverson,
Thune's communication director, when asked about the omission.</TE>
<TE>   Thune's opponent, Sen. Tim Johnson, has signed a pledge to oppose
individual accounts. But Thune is running an ad accusing Johnson of
supporting privatization because the senator expressed interest in
Clinton-era proposals to let government directly invest the Social
Security surplus in the market.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson later voted for a resolution opposing the idea, which
President Clinton abandoned. But Iverson said, "It is no stretch at
all to argue that supporting the central government investing Social
Security funds in the stock market is privatization." In the same ad,
Thune accuses Johnson of repeatedly "raiding" Social Security by
voting for federal budgets that used taxes raised for Social Security
to fund the rest of government.</TE>
<TE>   But Thune last spring voted for a GOP budget resolution that used
all of the $170 billion anticipated Social Security surplus in 2003
to fund the general operation of government.</TE>
<TE>   "Thune is following the national Republican playbook on this--to
distort your opponents' position and do everything you can to avoid
revealing your own," charged Dan Pfeiffer, Johnson's communications
director.</TE>
<TE>   But Johnson, like other Democrats, may be open to questions about
how clearly he is revealing the implications of his own position.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how he would strengthen Social Security, Johnson said
his priority is to stop using Social Security funds to operate the
rest of government.</TE>
<TE>   That approach follows the Democratic thinking that emerged late in
Clinton's second term. The idea was to use the surplus temporarily
accumulating in Social Security before the baby boom generation
retires solely to pay down the national debt (an idea that became
known as the lockbox). Shrinking the debt would have reduced the
annual interest costs the federal government pays by more than $200
billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the 2000 Democratic
presidential nominee, proposed transferring those annual interest
savings into Social Security, extending the expected solvency of the
program past 2050.</TE>
<TE>   But that idea has been undermined by the downward turn in
government finances. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
recently estimated that the costs of the war against terrorism, the
recession and Bush's tax cut will force Washington to divert at least
$1.6 trillion, and probably as much as $2.1 trillion, in Social
Security funds to help operate the rest of government through 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and other Democrats have given little sense of how they
would improve the government's balance sheet to avoid that. For
instance, Johnson said he would oppose reconsidering the later stages
of Bush's 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   But even Democratic analysts such as Gene Sperling, Clinton's
White House economic advisor, say in the near term it would be almost
impossible for government to balance its books without Social
Security money unless it reclaims some revenue from the tax cut. "In
our current fiscal scenario," Sperling said, "I don't see another
way."</TE>

<HD>Across Nation, Critics of Bush Express Support for Iraq War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>She's a self-described liberal Democrat from Florida who voted for Al
Gore and has little confidence in President Bush. Nevertheless, Jill
Hogsed is willing to accept the judgment of a president she dislikes
and accept substantial American casualties in a ground assault on
Baghdad if that's what it takes to oust Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   "I do have to have a little bit of blind faith" in Bush, even
though "he's not as smart as I feel a president needs to be," said
Hogsed, a 42-year-old mother of two young children in Melbourne
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't remember a time in my lifetime when our country was
targeted, and because that's so frightening, I will support people
who have more experience and knowledge than I do," Hogsed said. She
struggled to explain: "I don't think being a liberal means being a
sitting duck."</LD>
<TE>   The will to war builds slowly in a nation that long thought itself
invulnerable. But even as the Bush administration has failed to
produce a smoking gun linking Hussein to the Sept. 11 attacks, a
substantial majority of Americans--including people who are no fans
of Bush and would never describe themselves as hawks--say they would
support the president's use of U.S. ground troops against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein has to be put to a stop," Hogsed said. "He totally
needs to be gone."</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with Americans across the nation, as well as a spate of
recent polls, indicate that support for military action against Iraq
reaches well beyond those conservative Republicans most expected to
back Bush. In late August, The Times Poll found that 59% of
respondents believe the U.S. should take military action to remove
Hussein from power. An even larger majority, 64%, said they would
support a ground attack on Iraq if Bush decided to launch one, with
28% opposed.</TE>
<TE>   The tallies indicate that a growing number of political moderates
have concluded that there is no alternative to the use of preemptive
force to prevent Iraq from acquiring nuclear weapons or using its
chemical and biological arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   And Bush's move to shift the emphasis of his war on terrorism to
Iraq from Afghanistan appears to be succeeding.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Hussein or Osama bin Laden posed a larger threat to
the United States, 40% named Hussein and 27% cited Bin Laden in an
NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week. The poll of
1,011 adults was conducted from Sept. 3-5 and had a margin of error
of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, 77% of poll respondents considered Hussein a serious
threat; 58% thought that the U.S. was in a state of war; 84% agreed
that the terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks have their
next attack planned or in the works; and 80% believed the United
States should take military action to remove Hussein if it had
evidence that the Iraqi leader is building or is about to build
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   What the polls don't show is the degree to which many Americans
are ambivalent and worried, even while voicing confidence that the
United States will prevail.</TE>
<TE>   In in-depth interviews, voters who describe themselves as
moderates voiced deep concern about the consequences of either
inaction or unilateral U.S. military action. They fervently wish for
allies in any fight against Iraq, but even without allies, they say
America should defend its interests. And many express profound doubts
about whether Bush is up to the job, even while they stress their
respect for his office.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the end, these voters express a resolve to do what it takes
to defend America and a commitment to what they view as a patriotic
duty to support the president in a war. And they express confidence
that America will prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Peggy Nelms, 71, remembers the fear and sense of vulnerability
inspired by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. She remembers Adolf
Hitler and the revelations about the Holocaust that emerged only
after World War II. Now, the retired high school English teacher from
Palos Verdes Estates finds herself "thinking of what could have been
done, and the appeasement, and the threat of what our president calls
'nuke-yaler' weapons," mocking his mispronunciation of the word.</TE>
<TE>   "The threat of annihilation with nuclear and biological
weapons--and the missiles--is so much greater," Nelms added. "We used
to feel protected, and now you're threatened by Iraq in your own home
here in California, because he can 'getcha!' "</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of a long conversation, Nelms explained why she
feels "very, very torn" over the administration's Iraq policy, yet
why she believes the U.S. must commit ground troops to resolving the
crisis, even if it cannot rally allies to its cause.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a grandson who is registered for the draft who will be 20
in November," she said. "He's sleeping in the other room .... On the
other hand, my husband was in World War II, my father fought in World
War II, everybody went. I do believe [Hussein] is a threat and I do
believe he's arrogant and I do believe he's making weapons. But the
idea of the U.S. invading without provocation is very hard to live
with."</TE>
<TE>   A fiscally conservative Democrat who has voted for some
Republicans in her day, Nelms is withering about Bush, whom she deems
"a little man." She wishes he would present "proof rather than
saber-rattling," and she compares Bush's case on Iraq's nuclear
weapons program unfavorably to the evidence that President Kennedy
presented during the Cuban missile crisis. She also has a visceral
distrust of politicians in general and the president's senior
advisors in particular.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't trust [Vice President Dick] Cheney and [Secretary of
Defense Donald H.] Rumsfeld. They're too much, and I do think Bush is
their puppet," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, Nelms said, in her heart, she feels that the Bush
administration's indictment of Hussein is true. "My common sense
tells me that he's evil, and that he's doing something. And when you
see the impact that can be made by [a handful of terrorists] on Sept.
11, it's scary."</TE>
<TE>   Nelms doesn't buy the arguments that a U.S. strike on Iraq would
destabilize the Middle East, since the region is already unstable.
She thinks other countries eventually will side with the U.S. against
Iraq. And, remembering the two-front war against Japan and Germany,
the idea of a long American military presence in Kabul and Baghdad
doesn't frighten her.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's my plain old American arrogance," she said. "We are
the best. I think we've proved that over and over. We're vastly
educated, we're vastly experienced, we're stable--plus, we have
resources."</TE>
<TE>   Count Nelms reluctant but ready for war.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Wheeler, a 54-year-old Democrat in Toledo, Ohio, thinks
Bush has already made up his mind to strike Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is going to get what he wants anyway, so it doesn't
matter what the U.N. says or doesn't say," said Wheeler, who recently
retired after 30 years painting cars on the assembly line at a
Chrysler plant. "He is our president, so you should stand behind him,
whatever decision he makes."</TE>
<TE>   If the accusations that Hussein is building nuclear weapons are
true, he must be stopped immediately, Wheeler said. "And I mean, it's
no big secret that we're not very liked over there to begin with, so
what's a few bombs? If he is doing these things, then he should be
taken out. If he wasn't, why wouldn't he let the U.N. [inspectors] in
there?"</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Wilson, 29, who works at a truck tire plant in central
Florida's Oak City, thinks Bush "is out for the rich man." But when
it comes to the need to fight America's enemies, with or without
allies, Wilson is squarely behind the president.</TE>
<TE>   "You get one terrorist, you got to get all of them and be done
with it," he said. "Take, for example, you got two rattlesnakes in
your yard. You want to get both of them or only one? You deal with
it, and you don't have to worry about it coming back."</TE>
<TE>   As for the lack of allies, he said, "They don't back us now, don't
call us when you need us."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a Democrat, expects that any war against Iraq would be
over in about a month, and he is prepared for American casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "Freedom is not a cheap crop to pick," he said. "If you've got to
lay your life down to keep us free, that's what your job is."</TE>
<TE>   Lifelong San Francisco Democrat Norman Ross said that he didn't
vote for Bush in 2000 but that he would vote for him now, after
watching the president's speech to the U.N. on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want my San Francisco blown up. This madman cannot be
allowed to have this kind of weapons," Ross said. "I think the U.N.'s
got to be told that 'If you guys haven't got the guts to do it,
somebody's got to do it before he blows up half the world.' "</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the voters interviewed for this story were
unaware of the lack of hard evidence linking Iraq to the Sept. 11
attacks, Ross believes Hussein does bear some responsibility, "in the
sense that he's aided and abetted" terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was anything he could have done to assist Bin Laden, I'm
sure he would have," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ross is not troubled by the arguments that preemptive or
unilateral U.S. action against Iraq could encourage other nations,
such as India or Pakistan, to justify their own preemptive military
strikes. But he wants U.S. allies to do their share.</TE>
<TE>   "I especially agree [with Bush] that we should go through the U.N.
and build a consensus among friends before we do it," he said,
adding, "I hate the fact that we may have to do it alone, and I
resent the countries that won't help. If we had to end up going this
alone to save their butts, too, I'm going to be deeply angry at
them."</TE>
<TE>   Hogsed, the mother from Florida, said that although she doesn't
like the job Bush is doing, she empathizes with him as he faces a
monumental decision. She's glad she doesn't have the responsibility
for making the decision to go to war, but she will support the
president if he does.</TE>
<TE>   "I want very much for our country to take the hardest-core stand
we can on terrorism," she said. "I wish I knew the best solution. I
don't. But I would want to be as aggressive and assertive and smart
[as possible] and beat the bad guys at their own game, because I
think we have to. We have to, to keep what we've got ....</TE>
<TE>   "It's horrible to lose even one life. But as with everything else,
you have to look at the big picture. And how many lives will we lose
down the road if we don't act to stop terrorism?</TE>
<TE>   "There are no guarantees. It's going to be ugly. And there are
always horrible repercussions," Hogsed said. In the end, she hopes
and believes, "it will become worth it."</TE>

<HD>Predicting War's Economic Effect Is an Oily Proposition</HD>
<DH>Iraq: No one expects a replay of 1990, when crude prices
soared after Hussein invaded Kuwait.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When Iraq invaded Kuwait 12 years ago, the shock caused oil prices to
soar and consumer confidence to plunge, and helped tip the United
States into recession.</LD>
<LD>   If the U.S. invades Iraq anytime soon, don't expect a replay of
1990.</LD>
<LD>   No one can predict the repercussions of a military offensive in
Iraq, but experts say the initial economic effects--if the war is
short and successful, as they predict--could be much less disruptive
than they were a decade ago.</LD>
<TE>   Oil prices might jump, economists say, but probably not as much as
they did then. Consumer spending might slow a bit, but not enough to
stall the recovery. And the economic stimulus of more government
spending might help ward off a double-dip recession.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this has much, much less impact," Wells Capital
Management economist James Paulsen said. "We got a pretty good read a
little over 10 years ago of the competitive deal between Iraq and
America. It's very one-sided. We can go have a war and watch it live
on CNN, and it might hardly be a blip on the stock market screen."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, far more disruptive outcomes are possible. The economic
damage could be substantial if the U.S. offensive goes awry, if Iraq
deploys weapons of mass destruction or if the conflict spreads to
countries where oil production is needed to avoid shortages.</TE>
<TE>   And even if its impact on the nation's economy turned out to be
negligible, its effect on the federal budget could be more
substantial, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But over the long haul, war with Iraq could leave a much bigger
imprint on the federal budget. In contrast to the Persian Gulf War,
when U.S. allies picked up most of the tab, many experts expect this
country to bear the full cost of the next campaign, and most of the
nation-building expenses that follow. That could limit Washington's
ability to tend to other priorities at a time of resurgent deficits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not devastating," said economist Dean Baker at the Center
for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal think tank here. "But
it's something. It will make Congress reluctant to spend more money
in other areas. They probably won't be looking to lower taxes. There
might be cuts in other programs, and we might see somewhat higher
interest rates."</TE>
<TE>   The key variable in assessing the economic effect of an invasion
is the price of oil.</TE>
<TE>   After Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent his forces into Kuwait
in August 1990, oil prices nearly doubled. Benchmark crude rose to
$41 a barrel as traders worried about the prospect of war and the
security of Saudi Arabia's reserves.</TE>
<TE>   But other big exporters quickly increased production, and prices
fell back to the low 20s by the time the United States and its allies
launched their air campaign in January 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost as if the waiting for is worse than the doing,"
Lehman Bros. economist Drew Matus said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the high prices lasted long enough to inflict significant
damage on an economy already weakened by a commercial real estate
bust and a big decline in defense spending. Some economists think the
price spike pushed the nation into the 1990-91 recession and "jobless
recovery" that bedeviled the administration of former President Bush,
who stopped short of toppling Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   If the current President Bush sends U.S. troops into Iraq to
finish the job his father started, the effect on oil prices is likely
to be less severe, economists say. Some believe the prospect of war
and its potential to influence oil production already is reflected in
today's spot prices, which have risen to nearly $30 a barrel in
recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "The effect on oil prices has already been felt to a large
degree," said Bill Dudley, Goldman Sachs' chief domestic economist.
"Iraqi oil exports have already been cut significantly."</TE>
<TE>   Oil experts note that Hussein's 1990 offensive took more than 4
million barrels a day of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil off the market. Today,
Iraq only produces about 1.5 million barrels a day, and other oil
exporters have the ability to boost daily production by as much as 6
million barrels.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi production accounts for 2% of the world's oil production and
about 8% of the output from the Persian Gulf region. The United
States gets about half its oil from overseas, none of it from Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally the price would go up somewhat because of nervousness,"
said Ron Gold, vice president of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation. "But if the risk is confined to Iraqi oil and others are
willing to make it up, the markets would settle fairly quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Economists also say the element of surprise that accompanied
Hussein's invasion is unlikely to be a factor in a U.S. offensive.
The Bush administration has telegraphed its intentions to the world,
they say, giving global traders and U.S. consumers plenty of time to
anticipate, assess and react.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not assume that Saddam Hussein is just going to sit
there and take what we have to dish out to him. He's got some cards
he can play," said Harvard economist Richard N. Cooper, former
chairman of the National Intelligence Council.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper worries about what might happen if Hussein fired Scud
missiles at oil collection and transport facilities in Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia or Iran. Even a miss, Cooper said, "it would play havoc with
the psychology of the market."</TE>
<TE>   Even a small, short-lived price spike could further slow an
already halting recovery, said Stephen Roach, chief economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody is looking for oil prices to move up
sharply and remain at elevated levels for a long time," Roach said.
"But we have a pretty vulnerable U.S. and global economy right now,
and it wouldn't take much of a shock to transform that vulnerability
into recession."</TE>
<TE>   Yet economists say the government spending that would accompany a
big military operation could have a beneficial impact on the economy,
particularly if it arrived quickly. Every $1 increase in government
spending adds about $2 to the nation's gross domestic product,
Merrill Lynch senior economist Gerald D. Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   But experts express concern about the longer-term implications for
government finances.</TE>
<TE>   Operation Desert Storm cost $61 billion, most of which was paid by
other Persian Gulf nations and Japan. Current estimates of the cost
of a U.S.-led invasion of Iraq range from less than $50 billion to
$150 billion, and experts say it appears doubtful that other
countries will kick in this time.</TE>
<TE>   If a war costs $100 billion and is confined to the fiscal year
that begins in October, Washington would post a deficit of about $245
billion in 2003, based on projections.</TE>
<TE>   That amounts to about 2% of GDP; it was up to 6% at the height of
the Reagan-era defense buildup.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the additional deficit spending remains manageable, the
cost of war and its aftermath would further tighten the squeeze on
discretionary domestic spending. That, in turn, would make it less
likely that Washington could find the money to finance expensive new
initiatives such as prescription drug coverage under Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it may be a mistake to even attempt to judge a
military campaign on its financial merits, said Richard Kogan, a
budget expert at the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot, in honesty, say that one should even think about the
economic arguments," Kogan said. "One should think about the
military, the geopolitical, the personal, the human, the dozen other
factors that are more important than these very small economic
effects."</TE>

<HD>Bin Laden's Henchmen Seen to Be Regrouping</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Al Qaeda members have moved to Iran, Syria and
Lebanon, intelligence sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network who fled Afghanistan
have blended into the volatile Middle East, regrouping in such places
as Iran, Syria and Lebanon, where they may be even harder to detect
and combat, highly placed Arab intelligence sources say.</LD>
<LD>   Two key leaders are among those who have fled to Iran, and many
other Al Qaeda members have gone to Syria and Palestinian refugee
camps in Lebanon, according to the sources. Al Qaeda has also refined
its use of the Internet to communicate, simplified its means of
sending cash to operatives and continued to aggressively plot major
terrorist strikes, said the sources, who spoke on condition that
neither they nor their country be identified.</LD>
<LD>   Although the United States and its Afghan allies killed or
arrested hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters and destroyed Bin Laden's
camps and sanctuaries in Afghanistan, they destroyed neither the core
of the terrorist network nor its commitment to keep fighting.</LD>
<TE>   With no base of operations, and even less of a structure than it
had before, Bin Laden's network is becoming more difficult for
intelligence services to track and may be even more dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in the region fear that if Al Qaeda takes root in the
Middle East, it will find plenty of partners who may not completely
share its ideology, but do share common enemies: the United States
and Israel. Operating under the cloak of the Arab-Israeli conflict,
it might thereby increase its following and credibility in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   "The result of so many people leaving Afghanistan is, it is now
very difficult for us to follow them," said an intelligence officer
whose agency has a proven record of infiltrating and cracking
terrorist cells.</TE>
<TE>   "It broadened their sphere of operation and increased the danger.
It gave Al Qaeda members the opportunity to give their expertise to
other people in other countries."</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence official said he was more concerned about Al
Qaeda members turning up in Palestinian camps in Lebanon than in
Iran. In Lebanon, the source said, "Al Qaeda will be able to operate
under a false flag."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suspects Turned Over</TE>
<TE>   Lebanon, Syria and Iran have all denied that Al Qaeda members are
living in their territory. Indeed, Iran has turned over more than a
dozen Al Qaeda suspects to Saudi Arabian authorities. Syria also has
arrested some terrorists and provided valuable intelligence
information to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But Arab intelligence sources said some power centers such as
Iran's Revolutionary Guards are actively supporting the organization,
providing everything from safe houses to phony travel documents.</TE>
<TE>   Arab sources say there may be hundreds of Al Qaeda members in Iran
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Senior U.S. intelligence officials concur that Al Qaeda operatives
have probably reached Iran, Syria and Lebanon, but say they believe
that the number in Iran is lower than estimated by the Arab sources,
perhaps only dozens.</TE>
<TE>   "When you step on an ant pile, as we did in Afghanistan, the Al
Qaeda members run off in different directions," said a U.S. official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Many are from different areas
in the Middle East, and you expect them to go back to where they or
their friends came from."</TE>
<TE>   The Arab intelligence sources say they have solid information that
Bin Laden, his right-hand man Ayman Zawahiri and Taliban leader
Mullah Mohammed Omar are alive, still in Afghanistan, and using the
Internet to communicate. U.S. officials say they don't know the fate
of Bin Laden or his top aides but continue to hunt them because there
is no evidence that they are dead.</TE>
<TE>   Arab intelligence officials are more concerned about what is going
on outside Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In the months since the Taliban fell, intelligence agencies say
they have stopped about half a dozen attempted attacks, including one
in Morocco, where Al Qaeda operatives allegedly planned to blow up
ships in the Strait of Gibraltar.</TE>
<TE>   By cracking that cell, intelligence services learned that Al Qaeda
members ask ordinary people with no connection to their group to open
a bank account. When money is transferred to the account, the
obliging account holder gets a payoff and the terrorists get their
capital. In Morocco, that is how the group got its hands on $15,000
in cash, the intelligence source said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Secret E-Mail</TE>
<TE>   From other cases, the agencies have learned that Al Qaeda has
found a simple way to use e-mail that can't be easily traced. Two
people use the same e-mail account. One person writes a note and
files it in junk mail. The intended recipient logs in under the same
name and reads the note without its having been transmitted, making
it harder to detect.</TE>
<TE>   Arab intelligence data indicate that the largest concentration of
Al Qaeda members to flee Afghanistan and Pakistan is in Iran, a
charge that Iranian officials have repeatedly denied. Al Qaeda
members who have been arrested and interrogated report that many who
fled Afghanistan are living in the Iranian holy city of Mashad, which
is a destination for Shiite Muslim pilgrimages and therefore an easy
place to hide. Other operatives are said to be hiding in Zabol, near
the Afghan border.</TE>
<TE>   Reading from an analysis produced by his agency, the intelligence
officer said that Iran first turned a blind eye to Al Qaeda fighters
entering or traveling through the country but that later,
intelligence agencies and the Revolutionary Guards began to help
coordinate their activities.</TE>
<TE>   Iran is a nation divided, with power resting in the hands of a
hard-line minority that controls the military, security and
judiciary. The reform-minded government of President Mohammad Khatami
is not involved in harboring terrorists, the source said, but the
hard-liners are. Iran's dominant Shiite Muslims and the Sunni Muslims
who make up most of Al Qaeda traditionally distrust each other.
However, the source said, "They meet in their hate of America."</TE>
<TE>   Chief among those hiding out in Iran, the source said, are two men
who have taken on leadership roles in the Al Qaeda hierarchy: Saif
Adel, an Egyptian on the FBI's most wanted list, and Mahfouz Ould
Walid.</TE>
<TE>   Reports emerged in January that Walid had been killed by U.S.
bombing in eastern Afghanistan, but they were never confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   The source said the two men have taken control of Al Qaeda's
military and religious committees, with one organizing operations and
the other issuing religious edicts to justify them.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda members who have been arrested revealed under
interrogation that Iranian intelligence agents had assisted them with
phony travel documents, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Many operatives have passed from Iran into Syria and while the
authorities there have arrested some, the source said that others are
allowed to operate with impunity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chemicals on Passports</TE>
<TE>   The source said Al Qaeda operatives use chemicals to remove
potentially incriminating visas from their passports and then freely
pass back and forth between Damascus, Syria's capital, and Beirut.
This allows them to cover the marks left from the chemicals with
border crossing stamps from the two cities.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Arab intelligence reports say Syria, which
control's Lebanon's political life, has allowed dozens of Al Qaeda
operatives to take up residence in Lebanon's largest Palestinian
refugee camp, Ein el Hilwa, near the southern city of Sidon. Lebanon
has denied that any Al Qaeda members reside there, but the camp is
controlled by Palestinians of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, not the
Lebanese government.</TE>
<TE>   Arab sources have also found information indicating that there is
a large concentration of Al Qaeda members in Kurd-dominated northern
Iraq, which is beyond the control of Baghdad officials.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda has managed only relatively minor operations since the
U.S. assault on Afghanistan, with authorities apparently managing to
break up major ones before they were carried out. But the
intelligence source predicted that it is only a matter of time. "We
have a high level of success, but we expect danger every minute," the
source said.</TE>

<HD>Fed-Up Italians Rally Against Prime Minister</HD>
<DH>Europe: Demonstrators decry what they say is Berlusconi's
rewriting of laws to protect himself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>About 200,000 people rallied in one of Rome's biggest squares
Saturday to blast Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for what the
protesters view as his rewriting of Italian laws to save himself from
criminal punishment on corruption charges.</LD>
<LD>   Demonstrators of all ages, gathered in a festive atmosphere on a
perfect sunny day, also charged that Berlusconi, the country's
richest man, has used his dominance of Italian television to mislead
much of the public and thereby escape serious political damage from
his legal machinations.</LD>
<LD>   "Italians voted for Berlusconi to follow a dream but instead awoke
to a nightmare," film director Nanni Moretti, head of a group of
prominent intellectual and cultural figures who organized the rally,
declared to the balloon-festooned, banner-waving crowd.</LD>
<TE>   "Berlusconi is not against democracy," Moretti said. "Democracy is
something extraneous to him. He doesn't know what it is."</TE>
<TE>   The billionaire politician is on trial in the northern city of
Milan for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s. He owns almost all
major nationwide private television in Italy and, as head of
government, can influence the state-owned networks. He has not
yielded to critics who say his continued media ownership constitutes
a conflict of interest with his political role, and he charges that
Milan judges and prosecutors are biased against him.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's event marked a new peak in what has been dubbed a
"ring-around-the-rosie" campaign intended to ridicule Berlusconi and
prod the regular political opposition into more effective action. The
name originated from events earlier this year when protesters held
hands and circled government buildings in demonstrations that
mimicked the children's game.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of organizers' frustration with center-left politicians,
none were invited to speak at the rally, although many said ahead of
time that they would attend as ordinary participants. Police
estimated the crowd at 180,000, but organizers said that was too low.</TE>
<TE>   One of the banners at the protest showed an unhappy Berlusconi in
a blue-and-white-striped prison uniform, holding a pick and standing
before a pile of dirt, with a ball and chain on one leg. "Let's Let
Him Work," the banner read.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration came as Berlusconi was in the United States to
meet with President Bush about possible military action in Iraq.
Although the protest focused on domestic issues, one poster urged:
"Berlusconi!!! No War!!!"</TE>
<TE>   Organizers said the rally, which also featured music performances,
was the biggest spontaneous protest--one not led by politicians or
unions--in Italy since the social and political upheavals of the late
1960s and early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the protesters were gathering, a parliamentary committee
approved the key bill provoking their anger. It would allow
defendants to seek a change of court venue if there is a "legitimate
suspicion" that judges are biased against them. The bill has already
passed the Senate and could be approved by the lower house of
Parliament within the next month. Berlusconi's center-right coalition
has a majority in both houses.</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi is considered likely to use the law to have his trial
moved from Milan. Even if the evidence against him is quite strong,
as many of his critics believe, that could make it impossible for
prosecutors to win a conviction before expiration of the statute of
limitations. Critics charge that the law will have the additional
effect of making it easier for Mafia chieftains to escape punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Guido Dosso, 59, an architect and the organizer of about 400
protesters who rose before dawn to travel more than six hours by
chartered bus from Verona, said he came to Rome mainly to protest the
"legitimate suspicion" law. But he also criticized earlier
legislation similarly seen as designed to get Berlusconi off the
legal hook. Those laws decriminalized accounting fraud and made it
harder for Italian courts to use evidence from other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Many Berlusconi critics have expressed bitterness that Italy is
easing up on accounting fraud at a time when conservatives in the
United States, led by Bush, have urged a move in the opposite
direction, to tougher penalties, in response to corporate scandals.
This is often cited as evidence that Berlusconi is not a real
conservative but simply looking out for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Dosso said he saw no conflict between the festive mood of
Saturday's demonstration and the seriousness of the protesters'
charges against the prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   "With laughter we will blow him away," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   At the fringes of the mellow crowd, booths did a brisk business
selling radical-themed T-shirts, with photos of Che Guevara or the
word "Guerrilla" on a green background with a red star.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Marcocci, 33, a protester from Grosseto in Tuscany, wore a
T-shirt that quoted a part of the Italian Constitution that includes
the phrase "all people are equal before the law."</TE>
<TE>   "I came for my son," Marcocci said, referring to a 2-year-old. "I
hope that my son, through these demonstrations, won't find a worse
world than I found, but rather one with more justice, and more
trees."</TE>

<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Now that the United States has thrown down the gauntlet, the Bush
administration's best-case scenario for confronting Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein is a rapid sequence of events resulting in the
dismantling of his deadliest weapons--or in military action.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush stressed the urgency of action again Saturday
before meeting with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at Camp
David. "This is the chance for the United Nations to show some
backbone and resolve as we confront the true challenges of the 21st
century," he said.</LD>
<LD>   But the reality of the unfolding diplomatic drama may be quite
different. Indeed, the momentum generated by the president's speech
to the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday is likely to meet a series
of hurdles that could both slow it and make the process much messier
than it now appears, according to U.N. diplomats, former weapons
inspectors and Iraq experts.</LD>
<TE>   The preferred U.S. timetable is tight:</TE>
<TE>   * Two weeks or less to win compromise on a tough U.N. resolution
ordering Iraq to "comply or else" on disarmament, and authorizing the
use of force, if necessary, to secure that goal.</TE>
<TE>   * An additional four weeks to get U.N. weapons inspectors back
into Iraq to begin finding and dismantling its nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and ballistic missiles.</TE>
<TE>   * Then, within six months or so, Iraq would surrender its deadly
arsenal and potentially also begin to comply with a host of other
U.N. resolutions. At the first sign of obstruction, U.N. members
would be empowered to use force.</TE>
<TE>   Smooth. Clean. Decisive.</TE>
<TE>   And very improbable, according to U.N. diplomats, former weapons
inspectors, Iraq experts and even some U.S. government analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The first hurdle for the United States is a tough diplomatic sell
at the United Nations. The president continues to push hard.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. will either be able to function as a peacekeeping body
as we head into the 21st century or it will be irrelevant. And that's
what we're about to find out," he told reporters Saturday. Bush also
used his weekly radio address to press both the U.N. and Congress to
sign on to his initiative against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   But a basic question has already emerged over the number of
resolutions to pass. Washington favors one powerful resolution that
would be "front-loaded" and cover all the issues and options,
according to a State Department official. Other key nations, and
possibly U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, want a separate
resolution to deal with the issue of military force.</TE>
<TE>   Another diplomatic challenge will be persuading Russia, which as
one of the five permanent members of the Security Council has veto
power, to cooperate. The problem is not political, as it was during
the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when the Soviet Union had an alliance with
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Russia is a budding democracy, Moscow's ties with
Baghdad--and Washington's problem--are commercial.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably the most important element to make this work, to get
something substantial through the U.N., is working out a deal with
Russia," said James A. Placke, a former U.S. diplomat in Iraq now at
Cambridge Energy Research Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Placke said that Russia has been quick to use its Security Council
veto on Iraq-related issues. As Russian President Vladimir V. Putin
has consolidated power, he has made economic issues a priority,
Placke said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a pattern in the way Russia has responded to this issue,"
he added. "Russia is unlikely just to complain or abstain. It will
either vote for a resolution or against it."</TE>
<TE>   Moscow has two concerns. One is Iraq's huge debt to Russia for
past purchases of weapons and commercial goods. The other is oil
development contracts, which have been set aside pending the lifting
of U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq. Before signing on to any new
U.N. effort, Russia will want an agreement from Washington that
leaves both untouched, U.S. experts predict.</TE>
<TE>   France, another permanent member of the Security Council, also
will want guarantees, Placke said. The French oil company
TotalFinaElf negotiated a development contract for the Majnoon oil
fields on the Iranian border, which were discovered in the late 1970s
and have been undeveloped since.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. timetable will face a second set of hurdles if the
process of depriving Iraq of its deadliest weapons begins. The most
basic problem may be defining a violation of the U.N. resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Iraqis say they can't find the key to some trunk, is
that enough to go to war? Can the inspectors always go where they
want without warning? Like if they want to go to a place where the
Iraqis have an air defense system, shouldn't the inspectors tell them
so it can be turned off?" asked a former senior U.N. weapons
inspector in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this categorical language that sounds great in New York,
but when you start to implement it, you sometimes have to make
compromises with the Iraqis that actually make sense."</TE>
<TE>   Another problem could be timing. Resolution 687, passed by the
U.N. after the 1991 war, allowed Iraq 15 days to provide a list of
its weapons of mass destruction. The inspectors then had only four
months to check every Iraqi program, destroy all the weapons and set
up a monitoring system.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unrealistic then, given the number of facilities involved
both directly and indirectly," the onetime weapons inspector said.
"And it is unrealistic now."</TE>
<TE>   Monitoring Iraqi installations over the long term would involve
surveying any facility that could have dual uses--from schools and
breweries to leather tanning factories, hospitals and farms--to make
sure it had not been converted to a weapons plant.</TE>
<TE>   The former team of weapons inspectors spent all of 1994 monitoring
hundreds of sites--a huge operation that would have to be repeated
this time.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not going to be a walk in the park," said Judith Yaphe, a
former intelligence analyst now at National Defense University in
Washington. "It won't unfold quickly. It won't happen cleanly. And
we're not likely to get out immediately either."</TE>
<TE>   And the danger of pressing too hard could be a political backlash
that could linger long after Iraq was either disarmed or had its
leadership replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll often look like the bully on the block, throwing around our
superpower status for reasons important to us but perhaps not always
so important to others," Yaphe added.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the hurdles, there are also wild cards that could throw
what now appears to be a neat sequence of events totally askew. At
the top of that list would be a coup against Hussein, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a coup, the U.S. would be put on the defensive in
terms of justifying intervention. Plus the international consensus
could dissolve overnight," said Henri J. Barkey, a former State
Department Iraq expert who is now chairman of Lehigh University's
international relations department.</TE>
<TE>   "Then there are a lot of imponderables," Barkey said, "especially
if there is already a U.S. buildup underway in the neighborhood."</TE>

<DH>Colombia: Violence explodes in province where army, under
U.S. pressure, focuses on protecting an Occidental pipeline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARAUCA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Under pressure from Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum and the
U.S. government, the Colombian military has redeployed its forces to
protect a key oil pipeline, leading to an explosion of violence in
the undefended countryside.</LD>
<LD>   The army has reassigned the majority of its troops in this
war-torn province to patrol the pipeline, which is jointly owned by
Occidental and the Colombian state oil company. Leftist guerrillas
battling the government shut down production for a total of eight
months in 2001, but this year the number of attacks on the pipeline
has plunged.</LD>
<LD>   Civilians in Arauca, the province that surrounds the pipeline,
have paid the price. In the absence of any sustained military
presence since late last year, Colombia's violent right-wing
paramilitary squads quickly moved in, unleashing a campaign of murder
and terror with impunity.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of politicians, journalists, businessmen and ordinary
residents have been kidnapped and killed in the "dirty war." Brutal
combat between the paramilitaries and leftist guerrillas has forced
thousands to flee their homes. Scores of people have simply
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Arauca is now the most violent province in one of the most violent
countries in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, there is fire on all sides," said a man who was fleeing
recent fighting in the countryside, using his tractor to pull a wagon
piled high with household goods to Arauca, the provincial capital.</TE>
<TE>   The spiraling chaos comes just as the U.S. begins its first
tentative steps toward playing a more direct role in Colombia's
bewildering internal conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, U.S. aid has been limited to fighting drug trafficking.
But as early as next month, the first U.S. instructors will arrive to
launch a controversial training program to help Colombian soldiers
better protect the pipeline. The U.S. is also planning to send
helicopters and improve intelligence sharing with the Colombian army.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that the plan forces U.S. taxpayers to provide
security for a private company, Occidental. And human rights groups
say the local Colombian army unit, the 18th Brigade, has aided the
paramilitary advance, meaning that U.S. trainers may become complicit
in human rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "If you bring in more troops, this conflict is only going to get
worse," said Enrique Pertuz, the executive director of a local human
rights group. "If your enemy tries to overcome you with more arms and
soldiers, you respond in kind. There are going to be more killings,
more massacres, more repression."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Role of Paramilitaries</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian army has long been accused of cooperating with the
paramilitaries because both sides share a common enemy in the
guerrillas. The paramilitaries, financed by drugs and large
landowners, use massacres and torture to fight the rebels in areas
that have been neglected by Colombia's thinly stretched armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Colombian officials defend the training plan, saying it
will protect oil flow along the pipeline, which provides an important
source of revenue for the Colombian government. The additional income
from the protected pipeline will allow the Colombian government to
step up efforts to combat the rebels and paramilitaries, the
officials argue, as well as the drugs that flow to U.S. streets.</TE>
<TE>   But once here, the U.S. troops will be stationed in barracks that
suffer frequent attacks from the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say they are doing everything they can to ensure
the safety of the American soldiers. A handful of U.S. military
officers are already on the ground in Arauca, trying to improve
safety, but U.S. officials acknowledge that the bases will be
difficult to protect.</TE>
<TE>   The bases are small, poorly defended and located in cities
dominated by guerrilla militias. "You do your best to focus on
protecting your forces the best you can. That doesn't mean someone
won't get injured," a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Occidental and the Colombian government tolerated a
system that allowed the guerrillas to become rich from oil proceeds.
Now, that wealth has resulted in a clash between the guerrillas and
the paramilitaries that the Colombian army has been unable to
contain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Army Spread Thin</TE>
<TE>   Colombian army officials don't dispute that their focus on the
pipeline has hampered their ability to maintain order in the disputed
region, although they strenuously deny paramilitary links. The U.S.
aid will be the key to restoring their fighting capability, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could free up 30% of the troops that are guarding the
pipeline in order to be able to go after the guerrilla and
paramilitaries, things would be different," said Gen. Carlos Lemus,
the commanding officer of the 18th Brigade.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has been entangled in conflict in Arauca before. Earlier
this year, The Times reported on the involvement of U.S. government
spy planes, Oxy and a Florida surveillance company, AirScan Inc., in
a botched Colombian military operation in 1998 that left 18 civilians
dead in Santo Domingo, a small hamlet in the province.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, U.S. troops are arriving in the midst of a
maelstrom that has put Arauca on the front lines of Colombia's nearly
40-year-old war.</TE>
<TE>   Comandante Mario, the leader of the local paramilitaries, said
U.S. troops are walking into an inferno.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me, how many body bags are they going to bring?" he said as
his men patrolled a dirt road an hour away from 18th Brigade
headquarters. "Are they ready for combat in Colombia's jungles?"</TE>
<TE>   Arauca province was first populated in the 1940s and 1950s by
waves of refugees fleeing a period of bloody civil war known simply
as La Violencia--the violence.</TE>
<TE>   The settlers arrived to a region of spare natural beauty, where
Colombia's vast eastern prairie begins its sprawl from the Andes
mountain range toward the border with Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   Broad savannah spreads like a green blanket in every direction.
Hundreds of rivers lace the mostly treeless flatlands, flooding in
wet summers and drying up in winters. Giant rodents called capybara
roam the wetlands, and scores of brightly colored birds fill the air.</TE>
<TE>   The impoverished region was long forgotten by the central
government in the faraway capital, Bogota. The neglect allowed
Colombia's second-largest rebel army, the National Liberation Army,
or ELN, to take almost complete control. The rebels determined who
took public office through vote-buying and intimidation and extracted
"taxes" from local landowners.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1983, oil was discovered. Occidental teamed up with the
Colombian government to develop the 1.3-billion-barrel Cano Limon oil
field, located along the border with Venezuela. A 483-mile-long
pipeline was built to take oil to the coast.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oil Cash in Rebel Hands</TE>
<TE>   Though Occidental officials deny any direct payments to the
guerrillas, they acknowledge that oil money poured into rebel hands
via corrupt local government officials and Occidental subcontractors.</TE>
<TE>   That's because, by law, part of the oil profits had to return to
Arauca. The budget for the local government--dominated by ELN
sympathizers and allies--jumped from $300,000 per year to $60 million
to $80 million as a result of oil royalties.</TE>
<TE>   A tour of Arauca shows how little of that money found its way to
the community. The province is filled with incomplete building
projects, the result of money siphoned away by guerrillas. There is a
half-built water park, a half-built bus terminal, even a half-built
velodrome.</TE>
<TE>   The corruption was an open secret. But no one did anything about
it. It was simply easier to keep the oil flowing.</TE>
<TE>   "The guerrillas got rich," said an Occidental executive.</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, the money had attracted the interest of Colombia's
largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
the FARC. The group, which has expanded rapidly in recent years,
counts more than 18,000 fighters, compared with about 3,000 for the
ELN.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC demanded a share of the money. The local ELN-controlled
government refused. And the so-called "royalty war" began.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the FARC began to unleash a bombing campaign against the
pipeline that brought a halt to production--and thus to the revenues
that the ELN relied on to finance its army.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental officials watched with growing nervousness as the FARC
planted as many as five bombs a day along the length of the pipeline.
Oxy's oil field--which accounts for about 5% of the company's total
world production of 133 million barrels of oil--was shut down for
nearly four months beginning in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Top Occidental executives began meeting with Colombian and U.S.
officials in an effort to persuade them to step up pipeline
protection. They met with former President Andres Pastrana and U.S.
Ambassador Anne W. Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   The executives' argument was that Occidental wasn't the only one
losing money as a result of the attacks. The Colombian government was
giving up an average of $40 million a month in oil royalties, a sum
that eventually equaled $500 million for 2001--equivalent to 2% of
the national budget.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials began asking for improved pipeline security from
the Colombians. And they also began drawing up the plan to bring in
American trainers for the Colombian troops guarding the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental insists that it had no role in developing the Colombian
government's military strategy other than providing detailed
information on the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But it takes credit for raising the alarm.</TE>
<TE>   "We made them realize that they could not allow the attacks to
continue," an Oxy official said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Protecting the Pipeline</TE>
<TE>   The effort to increase pipeline protection began in July 2001,
after Oxy and U.S. pressure resulted in a special Colombian security
council meeting. The Colombian army sent in a special forces unit for
two months that successfully stopped attacks against the pipeline.
That convinced the military to redeploy more troops on a permanent
basis.</TE>
<TE>   On a parallel track, the State Department began drawing up plans
to improve pipeline protection in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. Its $98-million proposal was a risky gambit. Previously, aid
to Colombia had been limited almost entirely to anti-narcotics
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   But a top U.S. official acknowledged on a recent visit to Colombia
that the proposal was a "test" of congressional willingness to expand
the war on terrorism to groups beyond those such as Al Qaeda. The
State Department lists both of Colombia's leftist guerrilla groups as
well as the paramilitaries as terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "We chose the pipeline because every day it's shut down it costs
the Colombian government a lot of money," the official said. "One of
the things we asked Colombians to do is spend more money on their own
defense.... It made sense to us to keep a revenue-producing pipeline
going."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, last December, the Colombian army put its new strategy
in place. It more than doubled the size of the force protecting the
pipeline, adding three more battalions to the two already assigned
there. Military officials also began working with the local
prosecutor to step up prosecutions of suspected bomb-makers.</TE>
<TE>   Within a month, the aggressive new strategy showed results. Attack
attempts continued at the same pace, but now the army began
intercepting the guerrillas before the strikes were successful.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attacks Decrease</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, there have been only 29 attacks on the pipeline,
as opposed to 170 last year. And they have shut down the pipeline for
less than a month--compared with eight months in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Colombian military officials said they still need
U.S. training and equipment. More helicopters will allow them to move
even more quickly to attack the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had mobility, we could move our foot soldiers ... to other
parts of the province," said Lemus, head of the local 18th Brigade.
"We could maintain a permanent offensive, perusing all the subversive
groups, and not always be stuck to the pipeline."</TE>
<TE>   The improved pipeline protection has meant disaster and terror for
the rest of Arauca.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of families have fled the countryside for ill-prepared
urban centers.</TE>
<TE>   Arauca's dirt roads are scenes of misery, with trucks piled high
with furniture, farm animals and families fleeing violence.</TE>
<TE>   The homicide rate has soared. After an average of about 200
slayings a year in the late 1990s, the province is on track for a
figure of more than 400 dead this year, according to police
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   That translates to a rate of about 160 killings per 100,000
people--more than double Colombia's already record high of 64
homicides per 100,000. In the U.S., the figure is about six per
100,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a huge amount of uncertainty and fear," said Luis
Eduardo Velez, the deputy governor of the province.</TE>
<TE>   "People had learned how to live with the guerrillas. Now they have
to learn to deal with a totally different group."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, local paramilitary commanders said their aim is to
"purify" the province of politicians, journalists and others
affiliated with the guerrillas. Targets are selected with the help of
local guerrillas who have switched sides to join the better-paying
paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent weekday, Comandante Mario and about three dozen of his
men manned a roadblock on a muddy street about 15 miles outside
Arauca, the provincial capital.</TE>
<TE>   They were well armed, each equipped with automatic rifles and one
with an M-60 machine gun. They had a radio and said they were in
constant communication with other paramilitary fronts.</TE>
<TE>   The men, members of the Capital Bloc of the Vanquishers of Arauca,
as the local paramilitary squad is known, insisted that they kill
carefully.</TE>
<TE>   "We're an illegal, extreme-right army, but we have rules and
regulations to prevent civilians from being killed," said Freddy, a
squad leader.</TE>
<TE>   Mario said the paramilitaries follow a three-step process. In the
first step, the intended target is warned to stop collaborating with
guerrillas. If the person ignores the warning, he or she is told to
leave the province.</TE>
<TE>   "And the third step, well, you know what the third step is," Mario
said. "We execute them."</TE>
<TE>   Local human rights groups said the paramilitaries' arrival in the
region was facilitated by the 18th Brigade, which they said is using
the illegal group to supplement its own diminished presence.</TE>
<TE>   The rights groups have reported killings near army posts and
closely coordinated movements between the brigade and the
paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   But both the paramilitaries and the military officials strongly
deny any links in interviews. Both groups pointed out that they have
clashed on the battlefield, leaving at least nine paramilitary
soldiers dead this year.</TE>
<TE>   Mario said the only help his troops offer is indirect. Strikes
against the guerrillas aid the Colombian army in its effort to better
protect the pipeline by keeping the rebels occupied, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Colombian military officials said the presence of the
paramilitaries has only complicated efforts by stretching the army's
resources.</TE>
<TE>   The paramilitaries "are a destabilizing factor that has increased
violence," the 18th Brigade's Lemus said. "Whereas before we had to
fight against only two groups, now we have to fight three."</TE>
<TE>   Occidental executives said they regret the violence and noted that
the company recently boosted its spending on social development
programs in Colombia from $2 million to $3 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our opinion that the problem in Arauca, because of its size
and complexity, requires an integral solution" that involves both
economic and social development, said Juan Carlos Ucros, Occidental's
spokesman. Such a solution "will be what finally permits an
improvement to the reality the province is living today."</TE>
<TE>   Col. Emilio Torres, the official directly in charge of pipeline
patrols, said Colombia needs every dollar it can get to end its war.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our mission to protect the pipeline," Torres said as dusk
fell on the tiny outpost and his men sallied out on patrols with
night-vision goggles. "We have to protect it."</TE>

<DL>HAMBURG, Germany</DL>
<LD>The capture of fugitive Ramzi Binalshibh last week in Pakistan gives
investigators their first opportunity to fully understand the inner
workings of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. A frustrating
yearlong investigation that had been successful only on the fringes
suddenly has the potential to penetrate to the center of the plot,
according to U.S. and German officials.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't overstate the importance of capturing Binalshibh," said
one U.S. Justice Department official.</LD>
<LD>   Even before the capture, German Federal Prosecutor Kay Nehm called
Binalshibh "the essential person" in the plot. Investigators believe
that Binalshibh was a key conduit for both money and information
between the hijacking teams in the United States and the Al Qaeda
command in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Whether Binalshibh will cooperate with investigators is not known,
but he wasn't hesitant about proclaiming his role--and pride--in the
attacks in an interview he reportedly granted to the Arab satellite
television network Al Jazeera early this summer. In that interview,
broadcast last week, a man claiming to be Binalshibh described
himself as a coordinator of what he referred to as the "Holy Tuesday"
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   German officials are comparing audiotape of the broadcast with
tapes they had previously obtained of Binalshibh speaking at a
wedding celebration in Hamburg. Binalshibh is under indictment in
Germany as a conspirator in the deaths of more than 3,000 people. If
the voices match, the Al Jazeera tape will provide an ad hoc
confession.</TE>
<TE>   More urgently, in addition to crucial details of Sept. 11
planning, officials hope that Binalshibh can provide information on
current Al Qaeda operations. He was accompanied at the Al Jazeera
interview by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who many investigators think was
the initiator of the Sept. 11 attacks and who has since risen to the
top tier of the Al Qaeda hierarchy. Mohammed described himself in the
Al Jazeera interview as head of Al Qaeda's military department, so he
would presumably have full knowledge of current Al Qaeda plans, some
of which Binalshibh might also possess.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Jazeera interview apparently took place in Karachi,
Pakistan, in June. It was in Karachi on Wednesday that Binalshibh was
captured before a fierce gun battle that left two men dead. Pakistani
officials said it was only by luck that Binalshibh was not one of
those killed.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed has been sought by U.S. law enforcement since Philippine
police foiled a 1995 plan to blow up a dozen American airliners over
the Pacific. The Filipinos believe that the idea to use airliners as
bombs was Mohammed's, and he apparently carried it forward to its
eventual fruition last September. Other captured Al Qaeda officials
have told investigators that Mohammed brought the idea to Al Qaeda's
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed told Al Jazeera that a decision was made in 1999 to mount
an operation against the United States. Late that year, Binalshibh
and the three men from Hamburg who piloted the hijacked Sept. 11 jets
visited an Al Qaeda camp outside Kandahar, Afghanistan. Investigators
believe that it was at that meeting that the Hamburg men agreed to
take part in a suicide attack against the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the meeting, Binalshibh traveled to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, where, according to investigators, he met with other future
hijackers from Saudi Arabia and the man suspected of coordinating the
October 2000 attack on the U.S. destroyer Cole in Yemen. German
investigators say Binalshibh was in Yemen at the time of the Cole
attack, just as he seems to have been present nearly every step of
the way leading to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   He appears in the investigative record so frequently that some
German investigators now think that Binalshibh, not Mohamed Atta,
could have been the moving force behind the formation of the Hamburg
cell. Among other things, the investigators note that Binalshibh's
photograph was found among the belongings of several dead or captured
Al Qaeda fighters, as if he were a sort of revered figure.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh was born in a remote mountain region of Yemen in 1972.
He is reported to have worked in the administrative section of the
International Bank of Yemen in Sana, the capital, before arriving
surreptitiously in Germany in 1995. Investigators are unsure of the
precise date of his arrival. The first known record of him in Germany
was his September 1995 application for political asylum under the
name Ramzi Mohamed Abdellah Omar. He claimed in that application to
be a university student fleeing persecution in Sudan. While his
application was reviewed, Binalshibh was assigned to live in a camp
for asylum seekers, in the small town of Kummerfeld, just north of
Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   In the camp, occupants lived in a crowded, makeshift building that
authorities referred to as a container. Those in the container
complained constantly about their living conditions, but Binalshibh
remained in the background, officials say. Officials acknowledge that
the containers became home to a variety of illegal activity,
including document fraud and drug trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be easy to come here and build up an organization," said
Michael Hirsekorn, chief administrator of the camp. It was while
living in Kummerfeld that Binalshibh apparently met Atta, an Egyptian
graduate student. A former roommate of Atta's told The Times that he
recalled seeing Binalshibh at Atta's residence as early as 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh's asylum application was denied in 1996, and he
appealed. While the appeal--which was eventually denied--was waiting
to be heard, he returned to Yemen and, using his real name, received
a student visa to Germany and came back.</TE>
<TE>   The subterfuge about his identity has led some investigators to
believe that Binalshibh was already an Al Qaeda agent when he first
came to Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh became active in Hamburg's fundamentalist mosques. The
head of one mosque said Binalshibh often helped others interpret the
Koran, the sacred text of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   During his six years in Hamburg, Binalshibh apparently never had
regular employment and did not regularly attend school. He enrolled
in at least two college language courses but attended rarely or not
at all.</TE>
<TE>   He, Atta and a third man, Said Bahaji, became roommates in late
1998, sharing an apartment near the university Atta and Bahaji
attended. Bahaji and another Hamburg man, Zakariya Essabar, have been
indicted by the Germans on charges similar to those faced by
Binalshibh and remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   After members of the Hamburg group went to the Al Qaeda camp in
late 1999, they began making preparations to go to the United States,
applying to flight schools and seeking U.S. visas. Binalshibh applied
once to a flight school and for visas four times unsuccessfully. U.S.
officials have said he was denied entry not because he was a
suspected terrorist but because Yemen is a poor country and Yemenis
were viewed as potential economic migrants.</TE>
<TE>   After his failure to gain entry into the U.S., Binalshibh became a
sort of clearinghouse for the hijackers, investigators say. He
funneled money to the terrorist teams. He met with Atta at least
twice and with another of the hijacker pilots at least once. He
traveled widely, visiting the Netherlands, Iran, Afghanistan, Spain,
Yemen and Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   He also traveled to London, where investigators think that he met
with Zacarias Moussaoui, the only man in custody in the U.S. who is
charged with a direct connection to the Sept. 11 attacks. The U.S.
indictment of Moussaoui sets out the theory that Binalshibh recruited
him to take Binalshibh's place among the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui faces a possible death penalty if convicted, and his
fate may now rest with whatever Binalshibh tells interrogators.
Germans have resisted assisting in the Moussaoui investigation
because of their opposition to the death penalty. The same conflict
could also arise in the case of Binalshibh.</TE>
<TE>   German officials said Saturday that they want Binalshibh
extradited to face criminal charges in Germany. If that happens, it
will be almost impossible for U.S. authorities seeking the death
penalty to bring Binalshibh to the United States for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh is being held by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence
agency.</TE>

<HD>Ft. Bragg Murders Prompt Military Efforts to Relieve the
Stress of Duty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Kemp's wife has left him, a month after the miscarriage of their
child, and he feels ready to explode with frustration and anger.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than let his rage boil up inside, the staff sergeant is
venting his woes to Lt. John Fellion, a psychiatric nurse at the
field hospital on the Bagram base, the U.S. military's main staging
area in Afghanistan. It's his fourth visit in the last week.</LD>
<LD>   "It's helped. If I hadn't come in and talked, it would have turned
into an ugly situation. I might have said some mean and spiteful
things," said Kemp, visibly tense and on the verge of tears. His last
name can't be published because of Army policy. "This has helped me
let off steam."</LD>
<TE>   Kemp is one of hundreds of soldiers at Bagram receiving care and
attention they might not have had three months ago, before a string
of domestic murders at North Carolina's Ft. Bragg Army base led to
sweeping changes in the armed forces' psychological screening and
treatment procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Of the five murder cases that rocked the giant base this summer,
three involved troops returning home from Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Shaken by the killings, the Army brass sent a special team to Ft.
Bragg to conduct an inquiry of "physical, behavioral and any possible
pharmaceutical aspects" that may have been factors in the violence.
The team completed its inquiry this month but has not released its
findings.</TE>
<TE>   One reported focus of the probe is the anti-malarial drug that the
soldiers are required to take as a precaution for Afghanistan duty.
The medication has on rare occasion caused psychosis and violent side
effects.</TE>
<TE>   Without ruling out the effects of anti-malarial or other drugs,
medical staff members here say that stress disorders are more likely
being caused by the unusually uncertain and open-ended nature of the
U.S.-declared war on terrorism than by pharmaceuticals.</TE>
<TE>   The harsh conditions at the isolated, dust-blown and tightly
secured base at Bagram also are factors in stress levels here.
Soldiers work long hours but are generally not allowed off base for
security reasons. Temperatures that often exceeded 100 degrees over
the summer didn't help. In any case, the military already has
instituted psychological screening and treatment procedures designed
to discern soldiers' stress disorders before they erupt in violence.</TE>
<TE>   Under new procedures, all home-bound soldiers must undergo tests
for anger, depression, drug and alcohol abuse or suicidal tendencies.
Soldiers who finish high on the tests then undergo lengthy debriefing
and counseling at Bagram and, when warranted, compulsory follow-up
treatment at home.</TE>
<TE>   On their return to the U.S., soldiers deemed to be in precarious
mental health are escorted to a mental health facility to start
treatment before meeting their families.</TE>
<TE>   "If any soldier shows obvious signs of anger or depression, we
bring them in," said Lt. Col. Thomas Hicklin, who is leading the
testing here. "Some tell us things like they'd be better off dead or
that they get so angry they break things and they are automatically
debriefed here."</TE>
<TE>   Hicklin, a member of the Army Reserve's 113th Medical Company who
is an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at USC's Keck School
of Medicine in civilian life, said soldiers are specifically asked
how they feel about their reunions with wives or significant others.</TE>
<TE>   The Ft. Bragg murders have caused widespread concern not just
among the Army leadership but also among families back home. Hicklin
said he had been told that many Army wives at Ft. Bragg with husbands
in Afghanistan are concerned for their own safety.</TE>
<TE>   And soldiers at Bagram are worried about the possibility of their
behavior turning violent. "Soldiers have asked me, 'Do I take the
anti-malarial medicine and risk strangling my wife, or not take it
and risk contracting malaria?' " said Lt. Col. Ansar Haroun, a
psychiatrist here.</TE>
<TE>   Hicklin and others on the medical staff at Bagram say the
incidence of stress disorders such as extreme anger and depression is
running high. Even as there has been less action than many soldiers
expected in confronting remnants of the former Taliban regime and Al
Qaeda terrorist network, soldiers are being told that their duty here
could stretch out for months and, in some cases, years.</TE>
<TE>   "The soldiers are proud to be here, but the operations have gone
slowly and that's frustrating not being able to do more to eliminate
Al Qaeda and the Taliban. It's partly a waiting game here," Hicklin
said. "It makes it hard for them to measure success."</TE>
<TE>   Haroun, a reservist who in civilian life is a forensic
psychiatrist for the San Diego County Superior Court system, said the
lack of a concrete "end point" for the war has put many in uniform on
edge.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a tension between soldiers wanting to do the right thing
and make the world safe from terrorism and how and when they will
accomplish that," Haroun said. "In Desert Storm, they knew that once
Iraq surrendered, they go home. Here, it's not clear."</TE>
<TE>   Also a source of frustration is the clampdown on information.
Noncombat personnel--the vast majority of the 8,000 U.S. troops
here--have little or no idea how the war is going, said Army Reserve
Maj. Valvincent Reyes, a social worker and probation officer from
Torrance in civilian life.</TE>
<TE>   "The chances of a soldier being a psychiatric casualty here,"
Hicklin said, "is much higher than becoming a physical casualty."</TE>

<HD>Court Alters Outlook for Death Row's Mentally Ill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A death row inmate who claims there is a computer in his head and a
telephone in his shoulder is so mentally ill that the California
Supreme Court has appointed a legal guardian for him.</LD>
<LD>   The appointment, quietly made by the high court in a closed
conference, is unprecedented in California and may affect whether the
inmate can eventually be executed. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled
that it is unconstitutional to execute the insane.</LD>
<LD>   The court appointed a guardian for Jon Scott Dunkle, 41, on the
advice of a Superior Court judge whom it had asked to determine his
current mental state. That judge, who found Dunkle mentally
incompetent, had presided over Dunkle's 1989 murder trial and
sentenced him to death--despite his repeated commitments to a mental
hospital and defense attorneys' contentions that he frequently lost
touch with reality.</LD>
<TE>   Dunkle, who was convicted of murdering three boys, is so deranged
that he cannot fully understand the nature of his legal appeals or
assist his lawyers, San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Judith
Whitmer Kozloski reported to the California Supreme Court in March
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The high court gave Dunkle a guardian this summer so his medical
and school records could be obtained by his defense lawyers without
his consent.</TE>
<TE>   The appointment raises questions about whether Dunkle, diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia, was really ever sane enough to stand
trial for his crimes and whether he will ever be stable enough to be
executed.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we have the craziest client on the row," said Michael B.
Dashjian, one of Dunkle's lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   The court's action is expected to result in more petitions for
guardians from other mentally ill death row inmates. A legal finding
that a condemned prisoner is mentally incompetent can help defense
lawyers build a case against execution.</TE>
<TE>   "If a person is really crazy, he shouldn't be tried, let alone be
convicted," Dashjian said. "We certainly believe that Jon Dunkle
never should have been tried."</TE>
<TE>   Court records and transcripts of interviews with psychiatrists
depict Dunkle as a man who can express a coherent thought in one
breath and burst into gibberish the next. Absorbed by his own
hallucinations, Dunkle wants neither a radio nor a television in his
cell. When asked by a San Quentin psychiatrist in 1998 why he banged
his head against the wall, Dunkle said: "I wasn't getting along with
the computer inside me."</TE>
<TE>   He told another psychiatrist that he was being medicated because
"the computers, they are getting arrested. The technicians, they are
making people smaller. Five inches tall. The CIA is doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a client who psychiatrists say hears voices and suffers
delusions, defense lawyers told the California Supreme Court in 1996
that Dunkle was too unsound to assist in preparing a constitutional
challenge to his death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The court appointed Kozloski, who had sentenced Dunkle to death in
1990, to hear testimony to determine his current mental condition.</TE>
<TE>   When she presided over his 1989 trial for the murders of the two
boys in San Mateo County, Kozloski believed that Dunkle was faking
mental illness. A jury found him mentally competent at the time, even
though he was often incoherent and insisted at one point that his
first trial lawyer had murdered a highway patrolman.</TE>
<TE>   Kozloski's change of heart came reluctantly. "I have to say that I
would like to find Mr. Dunkle competent, because I think what he did
is so horrible that he should suffer whatever consequences have been
meted out to him," Kozloski said in court. "But I honestly cannot say
I think he is competent."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Rene Chacon, who is representing the prosecution
in Dunkle's appeals, did not object to Kozloski's finding of current
mental incompetence. He called her decision reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "Dunkle was sitting in his feces, he was so far out at San
Quentin," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the inmate will ever be sane enough to be executed,
Chacon said: "In California, you can't execute a mentally incompetent
person, and the guy cycles back and forth, so I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that the appointment of a guardian has given
defense lawyers more ammunition to overturn Dunkle's death sentence
on the grounds that he also was mentally incompetent when he was
tried for murder. A person is deemed incompetent if he or she cannot
understand the nature of the legal proceedings and cannot cooperate
with lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   But Chacon said the appointment of a guardian also serves the
prosecution, because it will expedite the legal proceedings and the
production of a habeas corpus petition.</TE>
<TE>   In California, death row inmates receive an automatic appeal in
which defense lawyers can object to events that occurred at trial.
They can also file a habeas corpus petition to raise claims of
constitutional or other serious legal errors based on evidence that
was not presented at trial, such as ineffective assistance of counsel
or newly discovered evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court voiced its decision on Dunkle's
petition for a guardian in a two-sentence order July 24--two years
after Kozloski made her recommendation. The court appointed Conrad
Peterman, one of Dunkle's attorneys, his guardian for "the limited
pursuing of preparing and pursuing" his challenge of his death
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Elisabeth Semel, who directs the Death Penalty Clinic at
UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, said the court's appointment
of a guardian was "a very partial and inadequate way of addressing a
much larger problem the lawyers have raised."</TE>
<TE>   Although the lawyers will now be able to obtain Dunkle's records
without his consent, his mental condition may make it impossible for
him to tell his lawyers about the events that shaped his life and may
have led to his crimes, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the client was seriously abused physically or sexually, who is
going to tell you about it?" she asked. "If your client is so
impaired that he can't even sign for a release of his records, how
will you obtain vital information from him?"</TE>
<TE>   Peterman, appointed to prepare Dunkle's constitutional challenge,
said he does not know whether he will be able to file the petition
without the inmate's cooperation. "It is a question we are discussing
but haven't resolved," the attorney said. The petition would have to
be filed next year.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very sick man, and, sadly, the whole process is just not
set up to adequately deal with people in that kind of condition,"
Peterman said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 mental health experts, including several who work for
the state prison system, said in 1999 that Dunkle was mentally
incompetent. Only one psychiatrist, Dr. James Missett, appointed by
the prosecution, disagreed. He had testified during Dunkle's murder
trial that the defendant was "evil" and faking schizophrenia.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Corrections has been giving Dunkle
antipsychotic medication against his will since 1996 after declaring
him incompetent to reject medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Kozloski believes that Dunkle's mental state has deteriorated
since his murder trial. And in reviewing his mental status for the
state high court, she gave no indication that she thought she had
erred by sentencing a mentally incompetent man to death.</TE>
<TE>   When a prosecutor insisted that Dunkle's condition was essentially
the same as when he was found competent to stand trial for murder 10
years earlier, Kozloski objected.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a qualitative difference between his 1989 ability," she
said during a hearing Nov. 3, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Semel said the legal threshold for competency to stand trial "is
so invariably low that it repeatedly allows people who cannot
meaningfully assist their lawyers to go forward to trial."</TE>
<TE>   In Dunkle's case, the jury that found him competent to stand trial
knew that he was charged with murdering two boys in San Mateo County
and a third in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Dunkle had confessed to his crimes and led police to one of the
bodies. All but one mental health expert who interviewed him before
his competency hearing in the summer of 1989 concluded that he had a
major mental illness, according to his appeal.</TE>
<TE>   While housed in a county jail in San Mateo County before and
during his trial, Dunkle had several psychotic breakdowns. In May
1987, officials said he was hallucinating and wanted to kill himself
and have his body displayed in front of the jail. He said that would
prevent the building from being blown up.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Dunkle was sentenced in 1990, he had been sent from
the jail to a mental hospital five times, Dashjian said.</TE>
<TE>   "He would leave court and go back to the mental health facility,"
Dashjian said. During one court proceeding, "he was completely off
the wall, ranting and raving and saying the most incomprehensible
word salad."</TE>
<TE>   Dunkle's lawyers are not sure when his mental illness began, even
though they have interviewed members of his family. He could not
function well in elementary school, and reports indicated that he had
learning disabilities. At the age of 22, he was admitted to a
hospital because he injected bacon grease into his penis in an
attempt to enhance its size. Besides the death sentence for the two
murders in San Mateo County, Dunkle is serving life without the
possibility of parole for the fatal stabbing of a 12-year-old boy in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   He was found mentally incompetent to stand trial in Sacramento in
March 1993 and was committed to Atascadero State Hospital. A judge
later decided he was sane enough to plead guilty while he was under
medication.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Dunkle's young victims were strangers. One of the San Mateo
victims was a 12-year-old who was on his way home from soccer
practice. Dunkle randomly chose the Sacramento boy he killed by
ramming his bicycle into the victim's bike on a trail and dragging
him into bushes.</TE>
<TE>   The third victim, who was 15, was a member of a family that Dunkle
had befriended. None of the boys were sexually assaulted, although
one was forced to undress.</TE>
<TE>   Dunkle's crimes were the subject of a 1993 television movie, "In
the Company of Darkness," starring Helen Hunt. The movie was based on
the experience of a female undercover police officer who pretended to
be Dunkle's friend in hopes of getting him to confess.</TE>
<TE>   The officer never succeeded, but Dunkle was eventually arrested
for a burglary and told his cellmate of the killings.</TE>
<TE>   If Dunkle loses his appeals, he still may escape execution if his
lawyers can show that he does not understand that he will be put to
death and the reasons for it. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1986
that it is cruel and unusual to execute a prisoner who is insane.</TE>
<TE>   Dunkle would then probably spend the rest of his life either in
prison or in a state hospital for the criminally insane.</TE>

<HD>10-Year-Old Mall of America Discounts Doubters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BLOOMINGTON, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Speaking in the hushed tones common to medical waiting rooms,
receptionist Juli Velebir was struggling to sum up just what it is
that makes the Mall of America such a dumbfounding and fascinating
quirk of modern culture. Then she smiled and nodded.</LD>
<LD>   "Well," Velebir whispered, "you can get homemade apple pie, a
vasectomy, and get married, all in the mall. And all in a short
afternoon."</LD>
<LD>   Ten years after it opened--and after almost everyone predicted it
would perish swiftly in an ugly retail wreck--the largest, strangest
mall in the United States has not only succeeded, it has boomed.</LD>
<TE>   You can indeed get a little outpatient surgery taken care of at
the Quello Clinic while the kids are riding the Pepsi Ripsaw Roller
Coaster at Camp Snoopy amusement park, perhaps, and your spouse is
studying accounting at National American University.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the surgery goes well, you might all be up for a bite at
one of 50 restaurants, some shopping at the 520 stores, perhaps
topping off the day with a visit to the largest turtle collection in
the world. And if that's all just too much post-surgical fun, the
clinic will still be there, right across from the FAO Schwartz toy
store--handy for shoppers and workers alike.</TE>
<TE>   "What's up, Dale?" Velebir asked a young man who works at the
Brookstone store one recent day, as he walked into the doctors'
office.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, I pulled a muscle lifting something."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh. Come on back to a room."</TE>
<TE>   There are about 46,000 shopping centers in the United States,
according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. The Mall
of America stands alone, however, as the temple to modern American
consumerism, in all its glory and gaudiness, ingenuity and excess,
with all its piles and stacks and storerooms of stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Yankee Stadiums would fit inside the 4.2-million-square-foot
behemoth. Theme park visitors had eaten 14,991,360 funnel cakes as of
earlier this year. The mall has gone through 96 million feet of
toilet paper and 5 1/2 million trash bags.</TE>
<TE>   With 43 million visitors a year, annual sales of about $900
million and an occupancy rate of 99%, the Mall of America has
dramatically changed how malls are conceived and built in the U.S.
and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first major mall to include high-end anchor stores,
such as Nordstrom, and discounters such as Marshall's, sometimes just
a few doors away from each other. It provided incubation for upstart
retailers, helping them with everything from floor-plan design to
marketing, and organized tour packages for out-of-towners.</TE>
<TE>   Most notably, however, the mall's developers bet early on that
shoppers did not necessarily want only to shop when they went to the
mall. They would, the developers predicted, come for entertainment as
well.</TE>
<TE>   With Camp Snoopy and its 30 rides as the entertainment anchor,
developers added several nightclubs, the Lego Imagination
Center--from which 156,000 Lego blocks have vanished--and a
neon-blue-hued bowling alley. Over the years they offered live
concerts by such performers as 'N Sync and Aerosmith, built NASCAR
Silicon Motor Speedway, and installed a 1.2-million-gallon aquarium
containing 65 sharks and 2,900 other creatures.</TE>
<TE>   "We opened a mall," said spokeswoman Monica Davis, "but we grew
into an attraction."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Mall of America lures more visitors annually than the Grand
Canyon, Graceland and Disney World combined. And about 40% of those
people are considered tourists, meaning they have traveled more than
150 miles to get here. About 6% of those have come from other
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Now the mall is planning to expand, more than doubling in size, by
adding what officials hope will be complementary rather than
competitive projects, such as hotels and office space. Plans call for
a 5.7-million-square-foot development on 44 acres just north of the
mall, with groundbreaking slated for 2003 or 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought it would make it, never," recalled Murray
Forseter, editor and publisher of Chain Store Age. Forseter was
certainly not alone.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, this suburb about 10 miles south of downtown Minneapolis
found itself with a giant parking lot and an empty Metropolitan
Stadium after baseball's Minnesota Twins and football's Minnesota
Vikings headed to the new Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. A study
vaguely suggested that the property, just four miles from
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, be developed as a
mixed-use site.</TE>
<TE>   Then a company named Triple Five invited city officials to visit
its West Edmonton Mall in Canada, with 5.3 million square feet the
largest mall in the world, though not nearly so famous as its younger
sister would become. Officials were impressed and gave the company,
run by four Canadian brothers named Ghermezian, the go-ahead to
develop a 10-million-square-foot mega-mall.</TE>
<TE>   That size would decrease over the years of planning, but the
developers pushed ahead toward a gargantuan indoor everything-center
despite the scoffs of critics.</TE>
<TE>   Why in the world would you build any "attraction" in Bloomington,
Minn., naysayers snickered? Why would you put a theme park, complete
with log ride, in a mall? How many Upper Midwesterners were really
going to flock to a Nordstrom in the suburbs for a $1,500 suit?</TE>
<TE>   Then, not long before its August 1992 opening, Federated
Department Stores--the parent of two of the mall's four anchor
stores, Bloomingdale's and Macy's--filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   When 11,000 workers showed up on the first day, the mall was only
71% leased. Two years later, however, that figure was up to 90%, and
growing. What many early critics perceived as weaknesses in the plan
became selling points.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here a lot in the summer but all the time in the winter,"
said Jodi Shafer as her two young daughters and their friend dug
through a pile of shiny rocks at a gem stand on recent day. "What
else are you going to do? This is Minnesota."</TE>
<TE>   As with other malls, the winter holidays are a high season here.
Unlike other malls, however, Mall of America also enjoys large
summertime crowds--just like other theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Simon Property Group--one of the original
co-developers, and which now runs the mall--has worked to increase
the number of reasons to come, and to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Management was irked at first by the hundreds of "mall walkers,"
people in sensible shoes who cruised the half-mile circumference of
the mall for exercise but didn't buy a whole lot. After the grumbling
caused a minor public relations crisis, mall operators began
encouraging locals to come for exercise, and giving them more things
to buy, like bottled water, shoes and shorts. Now, several hundred
walkers show up on an average morning, and 3,000 are registered so
they can swipe a magnetized card and log their mileage.</TE>
<TE>   The mall now contains a bank, a Northwest Airlines travel center
and the only full-service post office in a mall. There is the medical
clinic, a dental clinic and the Sage Clinic, which screens uninsured
and underinsured women for breast and cervical cancer.</TE>
<TE>   More than 3,500 couples have been married in the Chapel of Love.
When they opened it in 1994, the owners expected "a lot of Elvises, a
lot of zany people," said manager Sue Mills. An overwhelming majority
of the ceremonies have been traditional, however. People preparing to
tie the knot love the fact that they can buy their tuxedos and
wedding dresses, their cake and their photographs, all in the mall,
and have the reception in one of the restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the mall's unexpected success, it remains an anomaly. A
developer in Syracuse, N.Y., is planning one that would be
bigger--despite widespread predictions of failure--but that project
would be built in stages and include considerable office space.</TE>
<TE>   Another project in the Mall of America mold is nowhere on the
horizon, and may never be, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mall of America took the concept of a closed mall and made it
everything people wanted it to be," said Patrice Duker of the
International Council of Shopping Centers. "It was unique in its
time, but others don't necessarily want to replicate it. They only
want to replicate its success. People wanted a change then. Now they
want another change--and they want options."</TE>
<TE>   The latest trend, so-called lifestyle malls, are well-groomed
outdoor affairs that bring together mid-size retailers, including
home furnishing stores such as Pottery Barn, apparel outlets such as
Ann Taylor and Banana Republic, and book and music stores. There are
about 30 such malls nationwide, from Palm Desert to Germantown, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   For all their valet parking and park benches and fancy custom
shopping bags, the new malls, like all those that came before, seem
mostly like another, updated place to shop.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the Mall of America, with 4.3 miles of store
frontage, 17,750 parking spots, a place where visitors have taken 75
million amusement park rides and the janitors have turned gum removal
into a science.</TE>
<TE>   LeeAnn Loyd has helped pry up her fair share of the 72,000 wads of
gum found since opening day. She knows how to handle each type, from
the bubble-gum squashed into the carpet to the Dentyne on the
underbelly of a dining table.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to hit them all first with the can of gum freeze," Loyd
said. "Then you come back, each day, and scrape up a little bit more.
Sometimes it takes weeks. For the really tough ones, especially in
the carpet, we have a special liquid. But we get them up eventually.</TE>
<TE>   "And every now and then, somebody says thanks, maybe somebody from
another country. I'm still amazed by this place."</TE>

<HD>'Sopranos' Staying Hip Amid Hype</HD>
<DH>Television: HBO's series about a mob family looks for ways
to cash in without selling out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few weeks ago, eight cast members from the HBO drama "The Sopranos"
went to Foxwoods Casino, the gambling resort in the Connecticut woods
run by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe. The occasion was a private
dinner and meet-and-greet with several hundred of the casino's high
rollers--a kind of "Sopranos" fantasy camp with Tony Soprano, his
gangster nephew Christopher, and wise guys named Furio and Paulie
Walnuts.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third go-round for this under-publicized bit of show
business--a way for the actors on a hit show to pick up some extra
cash by mingling with the public in a controlled environment. But the
event also symbolizes a certain art versus commerce tug-of-war going
on beneath the surface of a series that many feel remains the crown
jewel of dramatic television, and one that continues to challenge the
normal processes by which studios and networks cash in on a hit.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth season of "The Sopranos" arrives tonight at 9 on HBO,
after a year-plus hiatus and with the kind of media anticipation that
the broadcast networks have come to crave in a cluttered,
many-channeled TV universe.</LD>
<TE>   Amid the possibility of unprecedented viewing levels this season,
"The Sopranos" remains the reluctant franchise--a reflection both of
HBO, where the goal is to hype by not appearing to hype, and of its
creator, David Chase. The formerly out-of-the-loop TV writer-producer
was given 16 months to complete a fresh 13 episodes of his series.
That amounts to half the number of shows in twice the amount of time
that his broadcast network colleagues are afforded.</TE>
<TE>   If Chase and HBO have earned this sort of creative and commercial
license, the goal now is to protect the integrity of the brand and
make millions all the same. It is a dance that involves keeping the
public interested while declining various merchandising tie-ins,
including a Tony Soprano sport-utility vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   On the phone from New York, where he had just returned from France
to attend "The Sopranos" premiere at Radio City Music Hall, Chase
hardly sounded like a show creator trying to beat back the market
forces that would turn his baby into a cottage industry.</TE>
<TE>   Chase wholeheartedly endorsed releasing DVDs of the first three
seasons ("I was the first one to say we should do a DVD"), and he was
involved with "The Sopranos Family Cookbook"--"a goof," he called
it--which is due in stores Sept. 24 from Warner Books.</TE>
<TE>   He said the cookbook, written in the voices of the characters,
grew out of the passionate interest in "The Sopranos" in the
tri-state area (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut), where the
Sopranos are familiar archetypes.</TE>
<TE>   Chase, 57, has said repeatedly that he will end his relationship
with the series after season five, perhaps stepping away before "The
Sopranos" has hit critical mass. "After season three, we all needed
to stop and sit down and figure out where the show was," Chase said.
"I could see another two years of where they were headed, and that
seemed to be enough. I thought there was more to say than just in
four seasons. I thought it needed more time to play out."</TE>
<TE>   Five seasons of "The Sopranos" would bring the total to only 65
episodes, making the series less lucrative in syndication. Hit
network series can generate vast sums of revenue years after they've
left the air through the licensing of reruns, but typically not until
they reach at least 100 episodes.</TE>
<TE>   In this context and others, the value of "The Sopranos" remains
difficult to quantify. As its popularity increases, so does its cost.
A source close to the show puts the per-episode production price at
$4 million (close to twice as much as most network dramas).
Renegotiated deals with star James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano) and
Chase will leave them with paydays in the eight figures by the end of
the final two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   For HBO, the fact that the series airs on a pay cable network
means it's cut off from commercial advertising sales. Although it
seems safe to say that "The Sopranos" has significantly upped the
network's subscriber base, the main source of its revenue, HBO
Chairman and Chief Executive Chris Albrecht says it is impossible to
know how many people sign up for HBO because of "The Sopranos" versus
"Sex and the City" or "Six Feet Under," another emerging drama.</TE>
<TE>   That said, "The Sopranos" has inspired its own commerce. Such is
the cultural influence of the show that it is now possible, as the
New York Times recently reported, to buy a CD-ROM outlining the
architectural plans for the Sopranos' suburban New Jersey home,
courtesy of the real-life owners.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to the HBO Web site can browse for T-shirts, calendars
and baseball jerseys (and coming soon, "Sopranos" gourmet foods). For
the actors, particularly those in supporting roles that don't
generate magazine covers, there are opportunities such as the
Foxwoods high-roller meet-and-greet, where gamblers who had accrued a
certain number of points got face time with the coolest characters on
TV, who posed for pictures and signed autographs.</TE>
<TE>   Chase, the man behind the curtain, doesn't see himself
participating in a merchandising circus just because he supports a
cookbook. The art of eating, it should be said, is integral to "The
Sopranos." "It's not like we imagine selling a zillion cookbooks,"
Chase said, adding: "It's more of a comedy book than a cookbook."</TE>
<TE>   He particularly cut short the suggestion that the DVDs should be
lumped in with other products. "The DVD is a separate issue," Chase
said. They have generated what one source says is about $75 million,
though Warner Home Video won't provide sales figures.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the extra publicity can only help HBO woo new
subscribers. Albrecht, like Chase, hardly sees a Sopranos sellout. He
noted that HBO is hardly alone in exploiting the DVD marketplace.
Other studios have been releasing favorite TV shows, such as NBC's
"Friends," on disc.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been myriad merchandising opportunities, most of which
we've declined, because they don't feel right," added Brad Grey, the
talent manager-producer whose Brad Grey Television produces "The
Sopranos" with HBO.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Series Like No Other</TE>
<TE>   When "The Sopranos" debuted on Jan. 10, 1999, it felt like someone
had opened a window in the stale room of series television. For all
the attention the show has received for its violence, profanity and
sexual content, critics also praise "The Sopranos" for the way it
recognizes contemporary consumer culture--a world of
anti-depressants, Sony PlayStations and cell phones that play "The
Godfather" theme when they ring. More than the mob hits, "The
Sopranos" is the sight of Tony, standing in his driveway, yelling at
his wife about the pulp ratio in his carton of orange juice.</TE>
<TE>   Along with "The West Wing" creator Aaron Sorkin, Chase is now the
"it" guy in dramatic television, though unlike Sorkin, he did not
emerge onto the scene fully formed as an auteur. It took Chase a few
decades, during which he wrote on "The Rockford Files" and "Northern
Exposure," to name two, and struck out with his own series, 1988's
"Almost Grown."</TE>
<TE>   Chase has said that the spine of "The Sopranos' " new season
involves the marriage of Tony and Carmela (Edie Falco), which has
long been laboring under Tony's infidelities and illegal exploits,
and the guilt Carmela feels for tolerating her husband's affairs and
his crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "There are issues between those two," Chase said. "They seem to
talk to others about it, but not to each other. We've sort of tried
to get them to talk to each other."</TE>
<TE>   As always, the feds are circling, and various characters retreat
into therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Season three ended in May 2001; HBO, which has cultivated a
boutique audience on Sunday nights by mixing in fresh episodes of its
critically acclaimed series, held new episodes of "The Sopranos"
through the summer to showcase its popular comedy "Sex and the City."
It was a strategy undermined somewhat by "Sex" star Sarah Jessica
Parker's pregnancy, which limited the number of episodes that could
be produced.</TE>
<TE>   For Chase, though, the extra time proved handy. Tony Sirico, who
plays gangster Paulie Walnuts, had an undisclosed illness and
required surgery. Chase says Sirico's medical situation forced him to
"rip up" the first six episodes, and he ended up putting Paulie in
prison in Ohio on a gun charge, which didn't necessitate shooting
with core cast members.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Syndication Possibilities</TE>
<TE>   Whether those who don't subscribe to HBO or buy the DVDs will see
the show in reruns remains to be seen. Grey says he thinks a credible
version of "The Sopranos" can be edited for nudity and profanity (or
at least scaled down) and sold into syndication, whether to a cable
or broadcast network.</TE>
<TE>   HBO has syndicated a few of its series before, though not with
great success. The comedy "Dream On" had a brief run on Fox, and "The
Larry Sanders Show," comedian Garry Shandling's withering
behind-the-scenes look at a late-night talk show, is about to test
the waters. Edited versions of "Sanders" (on which characters swear
liberally) will begin airing on cable's Bravo network later this
month and as a late-night series on individual stations, including
KABC-TV Channel 7 in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For HBO, figuring out ways to syndicate its series is a happy
problem given new immediacy; recently, the network created the
position of president of programming distribution to address
off-network sales of the HBO library.</TE>
<TE>   But there may be bigger plans for "The Sopranos." Chase, Grey and
Albrecht say they've had casual discussions about eventually
continuing the series on the big screen, in the way "Star Trek" moved
from TV series to film franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there a creative next step on film that we feel would be the
next step for 'The Sopranos'?" Grey asked. "Something that would
allow the series to grow in features, rather than continuing to grow
as a series? That is a very interesting conversation that we've never
had based on any network show."</TE>
<TE>   Chase, cautious about getting ahead of himself, didn't necessarily
sound opposed to the idea of doing "The Sopranos" as a feature. When
HBO picked up the show, he noted, he initially balked at designing
the stories to be heavily serialized.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do a movie each week. I have kind of an aversion to
TV soap. The whole reason people come back the next week [is to find
out who's sleeping with whom]. As much as we know about life in
organized crime, not a lot happens. We try to be true, to present the
quotidian nature of it. And it isn't that dramatic."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tension Draws Fans</TE>
<TE>   Notwithstanding Chase's devotion to the smaller moments of
organized crime in the New Jersey suburbs, fans like to speculate
about who's going to get whacked--a variation on the
who's-sleeping-with-whom tensions that propel interest in soap opera.</TE>
<TE>   Though unlikely, there is a possibility that "The Sopranos" will
win its time period this fall, going up against "Law &amp; Order:
Criminal Intent" on NBC, "Alias" on ABC, a Sunday night movie on CBS
and the sitcoms "Malcolm in the Middle" and "The Grubbs" on Fox. Last
year, airing from March through May, initial telecasts of "The
Sopranos" drew an average of 8.9 million viewers, according to
Nielsen Media Research, up from 6.6 million viewers in season two and
3.4 million viewers in the first season.</TE>
<TE>   That "The Sopranos" can even be competitive is impressive, given
that HBO is seen in roughly one-third of the estimated 107 million TV
homes. (Nielsen, The Times recently reported, inflates ratings a bit,
combining viewership on all of HBO's various channels when "Sopranos"
episodes air.)</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to ratings, HBO's Albrecht says the network is more
concerned with cumulative viewing as each episode is repeated during
the week.</TE>
<TE>   To some, "The Sopranos" remains the network's face, even though
other critically acclaimed series came on the air before it. "The
Larry Sanders Show" while never a ratings success, was the kind of
anti-hero comedy, beloved in entertainment circles, that justified
the slogan, "It's Not TV. It's HBO."</TE>
<TE>   "We started really getting people's attention with [the prison
drama] 'Oz' and continued with 'Sex and the City,' and those shows at
their inception were narrower in terms of the demographic they
brought in," Albrecht said. " 'The Sopranos' really took those
inroads that were created by those two shows and drove us to the
point where we had total credibility, not only in the creative
community, but in the press, and the sense that in popular culture we
were a thing unto ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, ever since HBO began stealing Emmy Awards--not to mention
the hearts and minds of the ex-college lit majors who populate the
entertainment news media--the broadcast networks have been red-faced
with frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in all the praise for "The Sopranos" and "Six Feet Under" and
"Sex and the City," broadcast network executives regularly complain,
is that HBO operates on an uneven playing field. The same creative
constraints don't exist on those shows, nor are episodes
straitjacketed into a format that allows for carefully placed
commercial breaks.</TE>
<TE>   And shows that the news media treat as hits on HBO would struggle
just to stay on the air in the mass-audience world of broadcast
network TV, where drawing 7 million or 8 million viewers (as "Sex and
the City" and "The Sopranos" have) is no guarantee of renewal.</TE>
<TE>   It is doubtful that the public much cares about these inequities.
But the growing concern that HBO--and specifically "The
Sopranos"--has infiltrated the content business was articulated last
year by NBC Chairman Bob Wright.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to various members of the entertainment community,
Wright called it "a show which we could not and would not air on NBC
because of the violence, language and nudity." The letter, duly
leaked to the media, came during the third season of "The
Sopranos"--and around the time of an episode in which a stripper is
brutally beaten to death. Wright went on to wonder aloud how nascent
an influence on popular culture the series had become.</TE>
<TE>   Even if HBO executives publicly reacted with bewilderment, the pay
cable network had to be pleased. That the opinion sounded as though
it was coming from an out-of-touch grandfather only confirmed how hip
HBO had become.</TE>
<TE>   It is evident in the billboard campaign for "The Sopranos." If HBO
needed to rebuild awareness after the show's long layoff, the ad
campaign is in keeping with the network's air of soft-sell cool. The
photos were done by celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, and there
isn't much accompanying text. The bus ads and the posters don't say
the title of the show, or what it's generally about, or who all these
slightly morbid-looking people are.</TE>
<TE>   All it says is "Sept. 15" and "9 p.m." and "HBO." The rest you are
just supposed to know.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ties 5 to Afghan Camp</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: New York suspects got Al Qaeda training, officials
say. Bush aides call arrests a breakthrough but warn of other such
groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and THOMAS MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Bush administration officials celebrated two breakthroughs in the war
on terrorism Saturday, saying the arrest of five U.S. citizens of
Yemeni descent in upstate New York and the capture overseas of a top
suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks offer significant opportunities to
cripple Al Qaeda operations.</LD>
<LD>   The five alleged Al Qaeda soldiers, all in their 20s, appeared
Saturday afternoon in a federal courthouse in Buffalo, N.Y., where a
judge entered a not guilty plea for each on charges of conspiring to
provide material support and resources to a terrorist organization.
They were ordered held in jail pending a detention hearing Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities alleged that the men, who were arrested Friday night
in the Buffalo suburb of Lackawanna, all received training at an Al
Qaeda camp in Afghanistan in the spring of 2001. At least one of the
men has told FBI agents of the group's travels to Afghanistan,
according to an affidavit unsealed Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the men were taught how to fire automatic weapons and were
in attendance when Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden visited the camp
and urged trainees to join him in a jihad, or holy war, against the
United States and its allies, said Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry D.
Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   With their arrests, "United States law enforcement has identified,
investigated and disrupted an Al Qaeda-trained terrorist cell on
American soil," Thompson said at a news conference at Justice
Department headquarters in Washington. He was flanked by FBI Director
Robert S. Mueller III and New York Gov. George Pataki.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. official said the discovery of the alleged Al Qaeda cell
was a sobering reminder that tens of thousands of Islamic militants
have been trained at war camps in Afghanistan and dispatched for
potential attacks, including the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we are aware that this is not an isolated case,"
said the official, who is familiar with the domestic
counter-terrorism effort. "There are other cells in this country in
which American citizens are actively participating."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, federal authorities have accused a U.S. citizen
from Seattle of trying to help Al Qaeda set up a terrorist training
camp in Oregon and have accused three men in Detroit of supporting
terrorism by acting as an organized "sleeper cell."</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorism and support of terrorists is not confined to large
cities and metropolitan areas of America," Thompson said. "It lurks
in small towns and rural areas as well." He added that the arrests
"send an unambiguous message that we will track down terrorists
wherever they hide."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the Lackawanna investigation is continuing at an
intense pace, even though there were no conclusive indications that
the suspects had imminent plans for an attack or that they had kept
in contact with Al Qaeda operatives.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested were Yahya Goba, Sahim Alwan, Shafal Mosed, Yasein
Taher and Faysal Galab.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials released little information about them, but they
said their arrests culminated a long-running investigation that
involved agents on several continents. They also said the
investigation was one of several reasons why America's terrorist
alert status was elevated last week to the "orange" level, the
second-highest, but not the only reason.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not fully know the intentions of those charged today, and
our investigation is continuing," Mueller said. He added that
authorities suspect that other co-conspirators of the five men remain
at large, and that "they will be investigated, and they will be
charged."</TE>
<TE>   At a second news conference Saturday held at FBI offices in
Buffalo, N.Y., Special Agent in Charge Peter J. Ahearn said no
weapons were found when authorities searched five residences and two
cars Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Ahearn also said the American Muslim community helped with the
investigation, but he did not provide details.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday afternoon, the men appeared before Judge H. Kenneth
Schroeder Jr. in a small, packed courtroom. Goba, 25, a heavyset man
with a thick beard, was the first to appear.</TE>
<TE>   Answering the judge's questions, Goba said he worked until May
2000 at a wholesaler and married three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Alwan, 29, who was well-dressed and wore glasses, said he earned a
moderate income at a firm called Satellite Services in the nearby
town of Medina.</TE>
<TE>   Mosed, 24, appeared nervous and used his copy of the criminal
complaint to hide his face. He told the judge that he was married,
with a 2-year-old child, and that he was a part-time student at Erie
Community College.</TE>
<TE>   Taher, 24, said he had a job until August. He has a 3-year-old son
and pays child support.</TE>
<TE>   Galab, 26, was the only suspect who had a private attorney, Joseph
LaTona. The lawyer said the affidavit was based on hearsay
information; he said that, as far as he knows, his client has never
been to an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   At Camp David, Md., President Bush appeared buoyed by the arrests
in upstate New York, as well as by the capture of Ramzi Binalshibh in
Pakistan, which came after months of often-frustrating efforts to
apprehend Al Qaeda leaders.</TE>
<TE>   A Yemeni national, Binalshibh, 30, was among the most-wanted of
terrorists, along with Bin Laden himself, for his alleged central
role in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and
other terrorist plots. His arrest Wednesday during a shootout between
Al Qaeda operatives and Pakistani authorities was disclosed Friday
night and confirmed Saturday by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called Binalshibh "one of the planners and organizers of the
Sept. 11 attack."</TE>
<TE>   "One by one, we're hunting the killers down," Bush said. "We are
relentless, we are strong and we're not going to stop.... We're doing
everything we can to protect our homeland by hunting down killers,
one person at a time."</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official said the arrests in both cases
prompted a rare moment of jubilation among those leading the
counter-terrorism investigation. Suspects in both cases, the official
said, could provide authorities with invaluable leads in their
investigation into the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the kind of days that not only advance our efforts but
also are a real morale booster for everybody that is fighting this
war on terrorism," the official said. "There is an obvious excitement
about this. You can't overstate the importance of capturing
Binalshibh, and you can't overstate the powerful message that this
sends to those who think they can hide in this country and evade our
notice."</TE>
<TE>   The developments capped an emotionally wrenching week in which
Americans mourned their dead on the anniversary of the suicide
hijackings, even as they were asked to go to an officially heightened
state of alert due to fresh concerns about looming terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials confirmed that they are trying to gain unfettered
access to Binalshibh, who was a former roommate of alleged Sept. 11
ringleader Mohamed Atta in an apartment in Hamburg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also believe that Binalshibh was meant to be the 20th
hijacker, but that he was thwarted by four unsuccessful attempts to
get a U.S. visa.</TE>
<TE>   After that, they allege, he sent money to several hijackers in the
United States, including Zacarias Moussaoui, who may also have been
trying to join in the hijacking conspiracy. Moussaoui is in custody
in the U.S. and faces terrorism conspiracy charges.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have so far been granted only limited access to
Binalshibh, who is in the custody of Pakistan's intelligence service,
the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, they said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Lackawanna case, the FBI said four of those arrested were
born in the U.S.; the other was naturalized when he was a teen. All
of them lived within blocks of each other in the steel town that has
become home to thousands of immigrants from the Arab nation of Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and relatives said they were stunned, describing the men
as friendly, nonviolent and interested in the teachings of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "I know three of them and I'm totally shocked," said Khalid Qazi,
president of the American Muslim Council of Western New York and a
nearby resident. "They are very good people, as far as I know, and
they never talked about anything related to terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Another local resident said three of the men are talented soccer
players and stars in the local adult league.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law enforcement officials portrayed the suspects far
differently.</TE>
<TE>   Seven men of Yemeni descent from Lackawanna traveled to
Afghanistan in two groups last year, according to an FBI affidavit
filed in connection with the case and unsealed Saturday. The two
other men are believed to be in Yemen, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   While in Afghanistan, the FBI said, the seven men attended the
same Al Qaeda "basic training" camp as John Walker Lindh, the
so-called American Talib who fought alongside the Taliban before his
capture last year.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh has since pleaded guilty to terrorism conspiracy charges as
part of a deal with federal prosecutors that requires him to
cooperate in ongoing terror investigations; authorities would not
comment Saturday on whether Lindh has identified any of the
defendants as attending the camps.</TE>
<TE>   While at a guest house near the camp, Alwan and an unidentified
co-conspirator "received lectures on jihad, prayers and justification
for using suicide as a weapon," according to the affidavit by FBI
special agent Edward J. Needham.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, Alwan arrived at the Al-Farooq training camp near
Kandahar, where he saw the four other defendants, the affidavit said.
Some of the men told Alwan "that they had been in training for 3-4
weeks, receiving instructions on firearms and mountain climbing," it
said.</TE>
<TE>   During the second of seven weeks at the camp, Bin Laden arrived
and gave a speech studded with "anti-United States and anti-Israel
statements," Needham wrote. "Alwan saw all of his acquaintances from
Lackawanna" at the speech.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities would not comment on whether Alwan or several unnamed
co-conspirators mentioned in the affidavit are cooperating in the
ongoing investigation, even though the document makes clear that some
have provided information to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo defense attorney LaTona said he received a phone call from
Galab about a month ago after Galab was contacted by FBI officials.
LaTona said he talked with FBI officials about setting up a meeting,
but before it could be done, the arrests occurred. After the hearing
Saturday, Qazi emphasized that he believed the U.S. justice system
would treat the suspects fairly.</TE>
<TE>   "They all have family and friends in the community. We want to
make sure the charges will prove to be wrong," Qazi said. "That will
be the hope of the families," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Each defendant faces a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted.</TE>

<DL>STILLWATER, Okla.</DL>
<LD>They don't throw jabs, they wait for the knockout punch.</LD>
<LD>   They don't bunt, they swing for the fences.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA's defense specializes in the big play, the
superhero-swooping-down-from-the-sky kind of play.</LD>
<TE>   It makes for light work for opposing punters, little use for the
Chick Hearn Memorial Refrigerator ... and victories in both games
this season.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's 38-24 victory at Oklahoma State Saturday came down to
turnovers, which is this defense's specialty. The Bruins intercepted
four passes and recovered a fumble against the Cowboys, a week after
two key turnovers propelled them to a season-opening win over
Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   So far it's working. But will it work when they face teams that
protect the ball more carefully and force UCLA to stop them the hard
way?</TE>
<TE>   The good news for the Bruins is that hasn't been a concern yet.
Even better news is their next opponent is Colorado, which looked
sloppy in every aspect of the game while getting pounded by USC on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to get turnovers, and turnovers win and lose football
games," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said. "We've been in the plus side of
that category two games in a row, and that's something we have talked
about."</TE>
<TE>   When a team has more talent and better game plans than its
opponents, as was the case for UCLA Saturday, it shouldn't have to
come down to the flukiest element of football.</TE>
<TE>   But at the moment, it's what they're executing more consistently
than any other aspect of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Cory Paus got off to a slow start, including an
interception on his first pass, but he did more things right than
wrong and was instrumental to the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Backup Drew Olson didn't do anything to merit more playing time in
his lone second-quarter series, and the Bruins couldn't give him a
chance to get some mop-up time.</TE>
<TE>   They should have had this game locked up by the fourth quarter,
but they didn't because the defense allowed 444 yards to Oklahoma
State, including 350 yards passing. With less than four minutes to
play, the Cowboys were down by 14 and driving in UCLA territory.</TE>
<TE>   What did UCLA do about it? Pick off a pass, of course. Ben Emanuel
snagged his second interception of the day and it was happy trails
for the Cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can make a play when we're called upon, no matter what
situation we're in," Emanuel said.</TE>
<TE>   They sure came through when they needed to in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   When the game hung in the balance, with UCLA holding a 17-10 lead
and a growing feeling that the next touchdown could determine the
outcome of the game, the Bruin defense simply wanted it more. More
than Oklahoma State. More, even, than the UCLA offense, which
couldn't decide if it was ready to take over the game.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Ball broke up a third-and-seven pass near midfield to stop
Oklahoma State's first drive of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel intercepted a pass at the UCLA 25 and returned it 23
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer Havner jarred the ball loose from Oklahoma State running
back Vernand Morency and Ball recovered.</TE>
<TE>   That was enough to hold the lead while UCLA's offense produced
only 25 yards, and the special teams "contributed" a 33-yard punt and
a missed field goal.</TE>
<TE>   After the fumble recovery, the offense got with the program. Paus
engineered an 82-yard touchdown drive that put the Bruins ahead by
14. And Matt Ware ensured they'd take that lead into halftime when he
intercepted a pass at the back of the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just trying to make big plays," backup safety Jarrad Page
said. "Everything is on us. That's when we perform best, when we've
got to do something."</TE>
<TE>   The best thing the Bruins had going for them in this game was
Toledo's play-calling. The Bruins used an even split of 17 runs and
17 passes in the first half. He pulled the right card all day long,
whether it was Manuel White slipping out of the backfield to take a
pass for 31 yards in the first half, or flooding the right side
before coming back to Craig Bragg on a screen pass that went for 26
yards in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   He clearly had the edge over Oklahoma State offensive coordinator
Mike Gundy. This wasn't a chess match, it was the big brother taking
all the territory from the little brother in Stratego.</TE>
<TE>   It was as if Gundy purposely ignored all of the pregame hype about
the marquee matchup between Cowboy receiver Rashaun Woods and UCLA
cornerback Ricky Manning. They threw toward Woods only once on their
first four possessions and he didn't have a reception in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   If the Cowboys would have pressed the issue sooner, they would
have come to this conclusion: Manning couldn't cover Woods. He had
nothing for him.</TE>
<TE>   Woods worked Manning and the Bruins for seven receptions, 143
yards and a touchdown, in addition to drawing four pass interference
penalties on Manning.</TE>
<TE>   "The yards we gave up, they just threw it up to [Woods]," UCLA
defensive coordinator Phil Snow said. "We played their scheme pretty
good, we just couldn't handle [Woods]."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins limited the running game, allowing only 94 yards in 34
carries, and they did create all those turnovers. But Oklahoma State
punted on only five of its 14 possessions.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotta get more three-and-outs than we're getting right
now," Snow said.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, his players don't feel like they've gotta get a new
m.o.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never be too reliant on turnovers," Manning said.
"Turnovers win games. That's the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   It sure has been that way for the Bruins.</TE>

<HD>Angels Do the Magic Number</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They pull off another rally, erasing 5-0 deficit
to beat Texas, 8-6, and stay tied for first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seemed somewhat silly at the time, all that talk from the Angels
about resiliency during the worst start in franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   Then the diminutive David Eckstein discovered a grand-slam swing,
Jarrod Washburn rolled at the front of the rotation and Manager Mike
Scioscia put it all together, so guess who's laughing now?</LD>
<LD>   The Angels again displayed their mettle Saturday in the kind of
extraordinary performance that is becoming routine for them, rallying
from a five-run first-inning deficit for an 8-6 victory over the
Texas Rangers before 39,909 at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   The resilient bunch (who could argue?) overcame three homers in
the first against starter Kevin Appier, including Alex Rodriguez's
55th, to win for the 15th time in 16 games, behind the American
League's top bullpen and a batting order that embraces the pressure
of September as few have in Angel history.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (93-55) matched their franchise record for victories in
a season, taking the first two games of the three-game series from
Texas (69-79) and keeping pace with the Oakland Athletics atop the
American League West as baseball's best divisional race approaches
the wire. The club's magic number to qualify for the playoffs is
seven.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared the Angels would lose ground to Oakland on Saturday,
but they were only catching their breath.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that these guys don't do is panic," said Scioscia,
whose club also overcame a 5-0 deficit May 22 in a 7-6 victory over
the Kansas City Royals. "They methodically keep playing the game and
keep their focus, and it's easy [not to] when you're down, 5-0.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just fun to be around these guys. They play the game to the
last out."</TE>
<TE>   They didn't cut it that close this time.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had five hits in the fifth and took a 7-6 lead on Tim
Salmon's three-run homer--his 19th--to center against reliever Todd
Van Poppel (3-2). Adam Kennedy's seventh homer in the eighth against
Rudy Seanez gave closer Troy Percival a two-run lead, and the cushion
helped.</TE>
<TE>   Percival overcame two walks by striking out Ivan Rodriguez, on a
fastball clocked at 98 mph, for his 39th save in 43 chances and
second in less than 24 hours. Scot Shields (5-3) worked 1 2/3
scoreless innings for the victory, and the Angels had another reason
to party their way off the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to say ... this club is just real special,"
Salmon said. "Being down five and coming back like we did, you run
out of words to describe the way we've been playing. It's special to
be a part of it.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a club that never quits and plays hard. I think that's
what every guy wants to be a part of."</TE>
<TE>   Relievers Dennis Cook, Shields, Scott Schoeneweis, Brendan
Donnelly and Ben Weber held the Rangers in check for 4 2/3 innings
after Appier was chased with one out in the fourth and charged with
six earned runs. The bullpen gave the offense time to play catch-up.
Shawn Wooten triggered the charge with a two-run homer in the second,
and Scott Spiezio's two-run single in the third cut the lead to 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   Appier, whose five-start winning streak ended in his previous
outing against Oakland, was yanked with one out in the fourth after
giving up a single and walking two to load the bases. Left-hander
Cook gave up a sacrifice fly to Mike Lamb, increasing Texas' lead to
6-4, and Shields struck out Alex Rodriguez, stranding runners on the
corners.</TE>
<TE>   "My stuff was kind of flat and the location wasn't very good ...
just a bad day," said Appier, whose earned-run average increased from
3.63 to 3.86 in his first non-quality start in more than two months.
"Fortunately, the bullpen came in and picked me up, and the offense
really picked me up big time."</TE>
<TE>   That's nothing new for the Angels.</TE>

<HD>Hybl, Sooners Blow Past UTEP</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Second-ranked Oklahoma made Texas-El Paso wish the thunderstorms had
never let up.</LD>
<LD>   The Sooners got several big plays on both sides, including two
interception returns for touchdowns, in a 68-0 victory at Norman,
Okla., Saturday night. The game included a 51-minute weather delay.</LD>
<LD>   Nate Hybl threw for 278 yards and two touchdowns and Quentin
Griffin had 108 yards rushing and two touchdowns as Oklahoma (3-0)
won by its widest margin since a 73-3 victory over New Mexico State
in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   Play was stopped late in the first quarter with Oklahoma leading,
14-0. After the break, which allowed thunderstorms to pass through,
the Sooners scored 24 second-quarter points and kept on rolling.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I said to the team--I didn't care who we were playing
this week, the bottom line is we needed to execute, have better
concentration and play to our potential," Coach Bob Stoops said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners were coming off a 37-27 victory over Alabama, a game
in which they had to rally in the closing minutes to win. This one
was never in question against a UTEP team that lost, 77-17, to
Kentucky last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Miners (1-2) were shut out for the first time since 1996, a
streak of 61 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the rain was going to help us out, slow them down a
bit," UTEP Coach Gary Nord said. "I knew we were going to be in for a
long night.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer it delayed, the longer it was going to take to get it
over with."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Texas 52, North Carolina 21--Chris Simms threw four
touchdown passes and Cedric Benson rushed for 208 yards and two
touchdowns for the Longhorns at Chapel Hill, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Texas (2-0) took a 24-point first-half lead and moved the ball at
will for much of the first half. The Tar Heels (1-2) challenged, but
Simms and the Longhorns responded.</TE>
<TE>   Twice the Tar Heels pulled within 10 points on second-half
touchdown drives, only to see Simms kill that momentum. Simms had a
10-yard touchdown pass to Chad Stevens late in the third quarter to
build a 31-14 lead and had a 58-yard scoring pass to Roy Williams in
the fourth for a 38-21 lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bowling Green 51, Missouri 28--Josh Harris passed for 311 yards,
caught a touchdown pass and had two short scoring runs to lead the
Falcons at Bowling Green, Ohio. Wide receiver Cole Magner threw two
touchdown passes for Bowling Green (2-0), which had 557 yards of
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, who completed 16 of 31 passes and rushed for 66 yards in
16 carries, caught a 34-yard touchdown pass from Magner on the game's
first possession. Harris took the snap and threw a lateral to Magner,
who found his quarterback streaking down the field for a 7-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Redd caught 10 passes for 209 yards and a touchdown for the
Falcons and James Hawkins had five catches for 112 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Smith was 28 of 50 for 334 yards, two touchdowns and had one
intercepted for the Tigers (2-1). Justin Gage caught a
Missouri-record 16 passes for 236 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech 42, Mississippi 28--Kliff Kingsbury passed for 270
yards and two touchdowns to become the Big 12's career passing leader
as the Red Raiders won at Lubbock, Texas. Kingsbury's 8,392 yards top
the record of 8,353, set by Texas' Major Applewhite.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Raiders (2-1) scored touchdowns on offense, defense and
special teams to send the Rebels (2-1) to their first nonconference
loss in 25 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas 44, Southwest Missouri St. 24--Greg Heaggans returned the
opening kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown and broke a 43-year-old
school record with 195 yards on four returns to lead the Jayhawks at
Lawrence, Kan. Heaggans' 195 yards in kickoff returns broke the
school record of 153 set by John Hadl against Syracuse in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Etienne scored on a one-yard fumble return and Clark Green
rushed for 131 yards and two touchdowns as the Jayhawks (1-2) got
Coach Mark Mangino's first victory in their home opener.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico 23, Baylor 0--New Mexico's blitzing defense held the
Bears (1-2) to 32 yards of offense in the first half to help the
Lobos cruise to a victory at Albuquerque.</TE>
<TE>   It was a costly win for the Lobos (2-2), who may have lost Quincy
Wright--the nation's third leading rusher--for the season.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, who was averaging 158.3 yards a game, left late in the
first quarter because of a possible torn ligament in his left knee.</TE>

<HD>Nebraska Finds That Penn State, Paterno Are Back, 40-7</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After consecutive losing seasons, Joe Paterno and Penn State are back
in a big way.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Johnson and Michael Robinson had two touchdown runs apiece
and Rich Gardner turned the first interception of his career into a
touchdown as the Nittany Lions routed No. 8-ranked Nebraska, 40-7,
Saturday night at State College, Pa.</LD>
<LD>   Paterno, who has more major college wins than any other coach, got
No. 329 in front of a record crowd of 110,753. It was the Nittany
Lions' first victory over a top-10 team since Sept. 18, 1999, when
they beat eighth-ranked Miami, 27-23.</LD>
<TE>   Penn State had two lean seasons after that, going 5-6 and then
5-7--Paterno's first consecutive losing records in his long career.
But with this one victory, the Nittany Lions showed their 75-year-old
coach how much they have improved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this puts us right back on the map and opened a lot of
eyes," said Bryant Johnson, who had eight receptions for 147 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Penn State (2-0) dominated the third quarter, eating away 7:10
before Robinson's eight-yard touchdown run gave the Nittany Lions a
19-7 lead. Quarterback Zack Mills faked the handoff to Sean McHugh,
then gave it to Robinson--the backup quarterback--on an end-around.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm smart enough to
know when you've got a kid like Robinson, you put him in the game,"
Paterno said.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner intercepted Jammal Lord's pass, intended for Ben
Cornelson, and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown to make it 26-7.</TE>
<TE>   After holding Nebraska (3-1) to three and out, Penn State got the
ball on its own 45. Larry Johnson took the first play 35 yards up the
middle, and Robinson--lined up now at tailback--ran for nine yards,
then 11 for a touchdown to give the Nittany Lions a 33-7 lead with
2:15 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half, they put points on the board, and it just
kind of snowballed," Nebraska Coach Frank Solich said. "It did seem
we played the game with greatly diminished energy as we fell behind."</TE>
<TE>   No. 22 Wisconsin 24, Northern Illinois 21--Quarterback Brooks
Bollinger scored a touchdown on a two-yard run with 1:21 left,
allowing the Badgers (4-0) to dodge the upset-minded Huskies (1-2) of
the Mid-American Conference at Madison, Wis. Northern Illinois sacked
Bollinger 10 times, held Anthony Davis--the Big Ten's leading rusher
last season--to 49 yards in 10 carries and had 455 total yards to
Wisconsin's 275.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State 36, Iowa 31--Seneca Wallace completed 23 of 37 passes
for 361 yards and a touchdown and ran for another score as the
Cyclones (3-1) rallied to beat the Hawkeyes (2-1) at Iowa City. Iowa
State scored three touchdowns in the first 10 minutes of the second
half and added a safety to erase Iowa's 24-7 halftime lead and beat
the Hawkeyes for the fifth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern 26, Duke 21--Brett Basanez threw to Jon Schweighardt
for touchdown plays of 34 and 38 yards at Evanston, Ill., as the
Wildcats (1-2) ended a losing streak that dated to last season at
eight. Alex Wade rushed for a career-high 134 yards for Duke (1-2).
The Blue Devils, who ended an overall losing streak at 23 games in
their season opener against East Carolina, have lost 14 road games in
a row.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue 28, Western Michigan 24--John Standeford had seven catches
for 143 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-deciding score
on a 30-yard pass play from Kyle Orton with 5:26 left, as the
Boilermakers (2-1) rallied to beat the Broncos (1-2) at West
Lafayette, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 31, Toledo 21--Junior quarterback Asad Abdul-Khaliq
rushed for a career-high 103 yards and a touchdown and also threw for
a score to lead the Golden Gophers (3-0) at Minneapolis. William
Bratton ran for 114 yards and three touchdowns for Toledo (2-1). The
Rockets stunned Minnesota, 38-7, at Toledo last season.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky 27, Indiana 17-- Jared Lorenzen threw three touchdown
passes and running back Artose Pinner had 233 total yards as the
Wildcats (3-0) defeated the Hoosiers (1-2) at Lexington, Ky. The game
was delayed twice for a total of 58 minutes because of heavy rain and
lightning.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois 59, Arkansas State 7-- At Champaign, Ill., Jon Beutjer--a
transfer from Iowa--passed for 266 yards and four touchdowns in his
first start for the Illini (1-2). Illinois also got 131 yards rushing
and three touchdowns from freshman Morris Virgil, whose 69-yard
scoring run was the longest for the Illini since 1988. Arkansas State
is 1-3.</TE>

<LD>   "Ultra-goofballs can wear you out. Take Rube Waddell, the great

an 'eccentric.' In his case, 'eccentric' was a fancy word for 'nut

out to him, only to have Giles look up and say: "I'm so embarrassed

<TE>   "There's a chance I might know it all by myself."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Enjoy Good Laugher</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They get 20 hits in 16-3 win over Rockies, who
have third baseman Zeile pitch in ninth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Saturday's game between the Dodgers and Colorado Rockies came with a
three-hour laugh track, but the fun didn't end with the Dodgers' 16-3
demolition of the Rockies before 28,118 in Coors Field.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers had a blast during the game, pounding out 20 hits,
including three by slumping Adrian Beltre, who had a homer and three
runs batted in, three by Paul Lo Duca, two by Brian Jordan, who had a
homer and four RBIs, and two by Eric Karros, who had three RBIs.</LD>
<LD>   They remained one game behind the San Francisco Giants in the
wild-card race with 14 games to go.</LD>
<TE>   And players from both teams were cracking up about Colorado third
baseman Todd Zeile's major league pitching debut, in which he threw a
scoreless ninth, getting Chad Kreuter to hit into a double play,
striking out Wilkin Ruan to end the inning and twirling his cap to
the appreciative crowd as he walked to the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   But the real party didn't begin until after the game, when seven
Dodger players, as part of a rookie hazing ritual, had to don Hooters
waitress outfits, with skimpy, skin-tight bright orange shorts,
midriff-showing white tank tops, wigs, lipstick and rouge, and walk
seven or eight blocks back to their hotel with their teammates in
tow.</TE>
<TE>   With one stop, of course: a Hooters restaurant down the street
from Coors Field.</TE>
<TE>   "We're walking as a team, the team chemistry is perfect right
now," said Jordan, who hit a two-run homer in the second inning, a
two-run double in the third and has 16 RBIs in September. "Right now,
we're all smiles."</TE>
<TE>   The game also put some cheer back into the Dodgers. They had lost
six of seven, their offense was slumping, and they were in danger of
slipping out of the wild-card race, but Saturday's romp--the Dodgers
scored 12 runs in the first three innings--could have far-reaching
ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy was able to pull starter Odalis Perez
after five innings and only 60 pitches, preserving the left-hander
for Thursday's all-important start against the Giants in the finale
of a four-game series. Perez gave up two runs and six hits, including
Todd Helton's fourth-inning homer, to improve to 14-9.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scored more runs Saturday than they had in their six
previous losses combined, and the heart of their order--Shawn Green,
Jordan and Karros--provided nine RBIs in 11 plate appearances. "If we
all get hot at the same time, we can score a lot of runs," Jordan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, Beltre ended a 10-game slump in which he
went 1 for 34 (.029) with no runs batted in, one run, two walks and
nine strikeouts. The third baseman had an RBI single in the first,
singled in the second and hit a two-run homer, his 20th of the
season, in the third.</TE>
<TE>   "The at-bats by Adrian Beltre were very special, and I say that
simply because we need Adrian Beltre," Tracy said of the
unpredictable 24-year-old. "We need him to do what he did for us in
July and much of August. If we're going to be playing baseball in
October, we need him, because we're a better club when he's doing
what he did today."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers became a better club once Colorado starter Victor
Santos took the mound. The right-hander had an 8.27 earned-run
average before the game, giving up 75 earned runs and 147 hits in 118
innings, and he left with a 10.50 ERA after giving up six runs on
nine hits in 1 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also rocked reliever Randy Flores for six runs in 1
1/3 innings and were so far ahead that Tracy pulled his starters by
the seventh and tied a major league record by using six pinch-hitters
in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The game was so lopsided Colorado Manager Clint Hurdle let Zeile
pitch the ninth, much to the delight of fans and players from both
teams. After warming up with his 8-year-old son, Garrett, in the
batting cage, Zeile took his 75-mph fastball and 50-mph knuckleball
to the mound and didn't disappoint.</TE>
<TE>   "In retrospect, I should have gone to Zeile a lot earlier," Hurdle
said. "I felt for all the people who waited around today. To put up
with our ineptitude and mediocrity, they deserved a treat."</TE>
<TE>   Zeile gave up a leadoff single to Cesar Izturis but got Kreuter to
ground into a 6-4-3 double play and struck out Ruan with a fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun, because it was like taking batting practice," Izturis
said. "Everybody was laughing, even the guy behind the plate."</TE>
<TE>   For the Dodgers, the entire day was a hoot.</TE>

<DH>Garret Anderson draws attention in pennant race</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANAHEIM</DL>
<LD>There's a minimum of flash to Garret Anderson's game, and that's
probably why he's played in virtual anonymity throughout his
eight-year career with the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Now that the Angels have a great shot at making the playoffs for
the fourth time in franchise history and first since 1986, Anderson
is being mentioned as a candidate for the AL Most Valuable Player
award, along with Alex Rodriguez, Miguel Tejada, Jason Giambi,
Alfonso Soriano and Torii Hunter.</LD>
<LD>   And rightfully so.</LD>
<TE>   "It's fine, I don't have a problem with it. It's not a bad thing,"
the 30-year-old left fielder said with a slight smile when asked
about his newfound recognition. "I'm going about it my way."</TE>
<TE>   That involves quietly going about his business on the field. He
doesn't flip his bat after he hits a homer, pump his fists as he
rounds the bases or leap with joy after a great catch.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a flashy person, it's just not me," Anderson said. "I was
raised to go out and play hard, let your numbers do the talking.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm quiet. You'll see a smile out of me, that's where it ends.
There's a couple times this year when I've gotten excited, like when
David Eckstein hit those game-winning grand slams earlier in the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to see me excited about doing my job. When
somebody does something above and beyond, that's when you appreciate
what's going on, and I'll react."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, an All-Star for the first time in 2002, is puzzled about
his lack of recognition until this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why. It would be a great answer to find out," the
Angels' only All-Star said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't write the articles, I'm not one to go searching for
publicity. That's OK. My focus is on winning and getting to the
postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about individual stuff. I had great numbers last
year, and we didn't do well. Ultimately, it's a team thing. In
professional sports, when you're winning, everybody notices you."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson recently became the first player in franchise history to
drive in 100 or more runs in three consecutive seasons, and he's got
a good shot at surpassing his career high of 123, which he set last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The left-handed hitter leads the majors in doubles and ranks among
baseball's top 10 in hits, extra base hits, total bases, multihit
games and RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he's a .300 hitter against both right-handers and
left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are a virtual cinch to surpass the club-record 93 wins
of 1982, and it clearly has been Anderson leading the way.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be an understatement just to say he's been a keystone,"
Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He deserves MVP consideration in
our league. He's automatic. You know he's going to get a good at-bat
just about every time he's up.</TE>
<TE>   "As I talk to managers and players around the league, they're well
aware of his ability. To the baseball world, he's known. We wouldn't
be talking about pennant races or playoffs if Garret hadn't done what
he's done."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson shies away from such talk.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of reasons we're doing well," he said. "I'm not
carrying this team on my back by any means."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Manager Art Howe poked a little fun at the media when
asked about Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "What impressed me about Garret Anderson is that nobody seems to
know about him. You guys do a lousy job of promoting this guy," Howe
said. "He's one of the better players in the league ever since I've
been in it. This guy can flat-out hit."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, second to Marty Cordova for AL Rookie of the Year in
1995, has played in 150 or more games in every season since 1996.
He's missed 16 games the last five years, one this season.</TE>
<TE>   And he keeps getting better.</TE>
<TE>   "I've searched for ways to improve my total game," he said. "I try
to be smarter about the game. What I try to do is watch the other top
players, find out what they're doing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a student of the game. I think all great players are. You
can't just use your talent, you have to be thinking out on the
field."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's teammates seem almost in awe.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a perfect swing, he has it," outfielder Darin Erstad
said.</TE>
<TE>   "His knack for driving in the key run is amazing," first baseman
Scott Spiezio said.</TE>
<TE>   "In here, he's as big a star as he should be in the entire
country's eyes," closer Troy Percival said. "I really respect the way
he plays the game."</TE>
<TE>   Percival called Anderson the perfect teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "He really hasn't gotten the respect he deserves," Percival said.
"He's been probably the most consistent player this organization's
ever had. The guy goes out there to win every day.</TE>
<TE>   "Very rarely do you ever see a smile, but it's fun when you do.
He'll hit that game-winning home run and then you see a smile on him
and you know, hey, he did something really good today."</TE>

<HD>A New Task for San Francisco</HD>
<DH>Football: 49ers take on a Bronco team that has accomplished
something they've failed to do in recent years--beat the Rams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BEACHAM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For three years now, all of the San Francisco 49ers, from General
Manager Terry Donahue to safety Zack Bronson, have been focused on
beating the mighty St. Louis Rams.</LD>
<LD>   At Candlestick Point today, the 49ers will take things one step
further, trying to beat a team that's already beaten the Rams.</LD>
<LD>   The Denver Broncos opened the season with a surprising 23-16
victory over St. Louis, the defending NFC champions and the 49ers'
recent tormentors in the NFC West. From Brian Griese's late-game
rebound to defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes' suffocating game plan,
the Broncos were everything the 49ers want to be.</LD>
<TE>   Bronson, a seldom-used backup when the 49ers began their
rebuilding project with a 4-12 record in 1999, was impressed by the
Broncos' ability to solve problems that have stumped San Francisco
for years.</TE>
<TE>   "Just watching the way they play the Rams, you can tell they're a
team that's going to win a lot of games," said Bronson, now a
starter. "I think everybody here was impressed by what they did. The
Rams are the ones we measure ourselves by. That's about the best
quality of early-season victory that you can get."</TE>
<TE>   Two franchises with seven Super Bowl titles between them will use
a rare regular-season meeting to gauge their progress. The Broncos
plan on getting back to the playoffs after missing them last season,
while the 49ers are determined to reach the Rams' level.</TE>
<TE>   That's why San Francisco Coach Steve Mariucci made sure the Niners
were aware of the Broncos' accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "They held the Rams to minimal yards rushing and the fewest points
the Rams are ever going to score," Mariucci said. "That's pretty
impressive."</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos' first visit to Candlestick since 1997 gives them a
chance to build on the good feelings from last Sunday, when Griese
led a late 71-yard drive for the deciding score.</TE>
<TE>   "I always think the first game is really important because it sets
the tempo for the year," Denver Coach Mike Shanahan said. "People say
it's just another game, but when you fall behind .500 in the first
game of the year and you've prepared for it for six months, it's a
little tougher."</TE>
<TE>   Denver looked good, but the victory also contained controversy.
Though Shanahan was ready to bench Griese for Steve Beuerlein after
some third-quarter struggles, Griese stayed in the game. The Broncos
hope he doesn't give Shanahan's trigger finger any cause to itch
again.</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos have seen Griese's talents when he's at his best, and
they want him to play at that level all the time, not just when his
job is in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of like a PR guy," Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe
said. "I'm kind of like Don King. I'm a hype guy. I make sure his
confidence remains high. I said, 'Look, you're driving the bus right
now.' Then, I told everybody, 'Brian's driving the bus right now, and
we're all on it, and we're all going to ride on it unless [Shanahan]
stops it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Garcia has an intimate knowledge of the crisis of confidence
that occurs when a coach doesn't believe in his quarterback. Just two
seasons earlier, Garcia spent several weeks in a battle with Rick
Mirer for the starting job, and Mariucci admitted several times the
position was up in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia won the job emphatically, making the Pro Bowl after passing
for a franchise-record 4,278 yards in 2000, but Mariucci's
no-confidence vote was the cause of some friction between the two.</TE>

<HD>Joint Return</HD>
<DH>Edwards makes remarkable recovery from catastrophic knee
injury</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gruesome as it may be, the videotape is somehow uplifting to Robert
Edwards. The Miami Dolphin running back used to slip it into his VCR
whenever he was feeling especially low.</LD>
<LD>   It brought him back to that fateful day on Waikiki Beach three
years ago, when his potential seemed as boundless as those impossibly
blue skies. He was playing four-on-four flag football in the sand
that day, in a game pitting the best of the NFL rookie class, and the
game was televised as part of the Pro Bowl festivities.</LD>
<LD>   On the most innocuous of plays, there was a horrifying twist.</LD>
<TE>   Edwards, then a rising star with New England, leaped to swat down
a pass and landed wrong. He collapsed in a heap, his left leg a
pretzel.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom of my leg went one way and the top went another,"
recalled Edwards, 27. "I grabbed my leg, but the bottom was just
swinging from side to side. I knew I was hurt; I didn't know how
bad."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards had suffered a knee injury so severe that doctors
considered amputating the lower half of his left leg. At one point,
the trauma was life-threatening for the running back from the
University of Georgia who had taken the league by storm as a rookie,
rushing for 1,115 yards and nine touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   No one had any idea the injury was so severe, of course, as
Edwards lay in the sand with what looked to be a sprained ankle. But
Raider cornerback Charles Woodson, who had jumped with Edwards to
defend against the pass, was close enough to know it was far worse
than a simple sprain.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at his knee, and I was just in shock," Woodson said. "I
just got up, dusted myself off, and was asking myself if that really
happened. I just looked down on the ground and he was hurt real bad.
I hated for that to happen to Robert."</TE>
<TE>   The injury was called a "knee dislocation," although that term
seems far too tame. Three of the four ligaments in Edwards' left knee
had snapped. Worse, his peroneal nerve was stretched, which was why
his leg was flopping around, and his popliteal artery, which supplies
blood to the lower leg, was sliced.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like someone just threw a hand grenade in there,"
Edwards' surgeon, Dean Soto, told ESPN. "It was a devastating injury.
At that point, I was much more concerned with saving his leg than his
football career. We figured, 'Well, he might be able to walk with a
cane someday.' That was the upside."</TE>
<TE>   The quick thinking of James Scoggin, the on-site orthopedist at
that flag football game, probably saved Edwards' leg. Scoggin
assessed the injury, then cleaned off a buffet table under a food
tent so the player could be placed on a makeshift gurney. He called
for an ambulance, which arrived no more than 15 minutes later, and
ensured that Edwards was in surgery within two hours. Time was of the
essence.</TE>
<TE>   (Seven months after the Edwards episode, UC Davis running back Sam
Paneno suffered a dislocated right knee in a game at Western Oregon
and waited seven hours before undergoing surgery. By that time, it
was too late, and his leg had to be amputated below the knee.)</TE>
<TE>   All this seems like a different lifetime to Edwards, who made his
triumphant return in a 49-21 trouncing of the Detroit Lions last
Sunday, scoring two touchdowns, rushing for 20 yards in four carries
and catching four passes for 38 yards. That's why he keeps the Hawaii
videotape within reach.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got down or felt discouraged, I used to watch it to
increase my confidence, just my morale," he said. "It just let me
know that I could have been way worse off."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards returned to his alma mater to do his rehabilitation, and
celebrated each incremental triumph, such as the day he was able to
wiggle his toes for the first time. The injury occurred Feb. 5, 1999,
and by that summer he was already off crutches--a year ahead of what
doctors had thought was a reasonable time schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he was far from returning to football. He spent 18 months
lifting weights, riding a bike, working out in a pool, restoring not
only his strength but his confidence in his leg. Then he moved to New
Orleans, where he trained with renowned specialist Tom Shaw, spending
a year essentially learning to run again. All the while, Edwards
stayed focused on football, determined to return.</TE>
<TE>   "I hadn't thought about [a contingency plan]," he said. "If I had
started planning for life after football, then it would have clouded
my judgment on me coming back. I wanted to keep everything positive
and focused on getting back in the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he did. The Patriots had him in training camp last
summer and it looked as if he would make the team. Coach Bill
Belichick called him "an inspiration to us all," and Edwards came
back faster and more agile than before his injury.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd do single-leg jumps," said Patriot safety Tebucky Jones,
who, along with Edwards, was one of New England's first-round picks
in 1998. "With that leg he hurt, he was jumping higher than everybody
on the team. So he got that leg real strong. Just by seeing how hard
he was working out, I knew he was coming back. He looked just like us
out there. The old Robert."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but Edwards was slowed by nagging injuries unrelated to
his reconstructed knee. A groin pull kept him on the sideline for
most of the exhibition season, and the Patriots eventually let him
go, choosing to go with Antowain Smith, a free agent from Buffalo who
later played a big part in their Super Bowl run.</TE>
<TE>   "I may be speaking out of line, but I don't know how Belichick
[thinks]," Edwards said. "He wasn't the coach who brought me in. He
wasn't there my rookie year. He doesn't really understand me. I never
got a chance to show what I could do. When I got healthy enough, they
cut me. I was denied a chance, I guess, because they had already made
up their mind."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Edwards got a second chance, this time with the
Dolphins, who already had signed Ricky Williams to be their No. 1
back. Clearly, Edwards is making the most of this opportunity and
last week received a game ball for his showing against the Lions.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to display that memento prominently in his home.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to show it to people so I can tell my story," he said.
"It's kind of an emblem of where I was and how far I've come."</TE>
<TE>   In with the game ball, out with the videotape.</TE>

<LD>Miami lacked motivation, couldn't stay focused, played sloppy and
still won by 23 points.</LD>
<LD>   Willis McGahee tied a school record with four rushing touchdowns
and Ken Dorsey threw two touchdown passes as the top-ranked
Hurricanes beat overmatched Temple, 44-21, Saturday in the Big East
Conference opener for both teams at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   The defending national champions, coming off an impressive 41-16

<TE>   "When we had an opportunity to put the hammer down, we didn't,"
Dorsey said. "You want to put a team away when you can."</TE>
<TE>   Tanardo Sharps had two rushing touchdowns for Temple (1-2). The
Owls have lost their last two games by a combined 55 points.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee, a sophomore tailback who replaced Clinton Portis, ran for
134 yards a week after a 204-yard performance at Florida. His four
touchdowns tied the mark set by Melvin Bratton and Alonzo Highsmith
in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey finished 20 of 35 for 314 yards and no interceptions.</TE>

<HD>Cal's 150 Points Not Moot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the time, it seemed like the most irrelevant NCAA penalty ever
handed down.</LD>
<LD>   In June, Cal was banned from appearing in a postseason bowl game
this season as part of a five-year probation for academic
improprieties and improper payment of hotel incidental expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Considering the Bears were 1-10 last season, the point seemed
beyond moot.</LD>
<TE>   But after Cal's stunning 46-22 upset of No. 15 Michigan State, the
Bears are 3-0 and halfway to the six-victory benchmark required to
play in one of this season's overabundance of 28 bowl games.</TE>
<TE>   Looks like the Big Game probably will have to do.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cal's turnaround is astounding.</TE>
<TE>   After three games, the Bears have outscored their opponents,
150-57.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't score their 150th point until their ninth game last
season--and they gave up an average of 39 a game.</TE>
<TE>   There's one obvious person to point to in explanation: New Coach
Jeff Tedford, the former Oregon offensive coordinator who guided the
careers of Joey Harrington and Akili Smith at Oregon after coaching
Trent Dilfer and David Carr for part of their careers at Fresno
State.</TE>
<TE>   The happiest person when Tedford got the job had to be Kyle
Boller, the quarterback from Newhall Hart High who was anointed
"Jesus in cleats" by the Cal student paper before his career began
but had been merely mortal.</TE>
<TE>   Before this season, Boller had thrown two more interceptions (38)
than touchdowns, his career completion percentage was 45% and Cal's
record since he arrived was 8-25.</TE>
<TE>   Against Michigan State, Boller completed 19 of 33 passes for 232
yards and had a hand in four touchdowns--two passing, one running and
a 14-yard reception from receiver LaShaun Ward.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only offense. Cal forced five Michigan State turnovers
and is plus-10 in turnover margin this season after ranking 114th out
of 115 Division I-A schools with a minus-17 margin last year.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Bears have another dangerous quality: Confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we have the athletes to play with anybody in the
country," Ward said. "Our coaching staff has told us that, and we're
all believers. We expected to win here, so we're not surprised."</TE>
<TE>   Unbeaten, Unimpressive</TE>
<TE>   No. 22 Wisconsin is 4-0 and fooling no one.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say we're a good team," Coach Barry Alvarez said after
quarterback Brooks Bollinger scored with less than two minutes left
to take a 24-21 victory and avoid being upset by Northern Illinois.
"I just know we have four wins right now."</TE>
<TE>   Those are over Fresno State, Nevada Las Vegas, West Virginia and
the Huskies.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, the only team plunging right through that line, as the
Wisconsin fight song goes, was Northern Illinois: The Huskies had 10
sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite honestly, they deserved to win the football game,"
Wisconsin offensive coordinator Brian White said. "But we won it, and
we're not embarrassed by it."</TE>
<TE>   A Northern Illinois victory would have been remarkable--and not
only because it would have been only the second in 27 tries against
Big Ten schools. (The Huskies beat Wisconsin, 19-17, in 1988.)</TE>
<TE>   Northern Illinois is playing without star running back Thomas
Hammock, a 5-foot-8, 214-pound Doak Walker award candidate who was
found to have a career-threatening buildup of fatty tissue around his
heart after experiencing shortness of breath the day after the
Huskies' season-opening victory over Wake Forest.</TE>
<TE>   But his replacement, Michael Turner, ran for 160 yards, and scored
the winning touchdown against the Demon Deacons with less than six
minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Storm Watch</TE>
<TE>   It was a rainy night in Georgia ... and Florida, South Carolina
and Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Seemed like it was rainin' all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   Tropical Storm Hanna soaked players and fans at games in the South
from the early afternoon into the evening, temporarily halting a
number of games because of lightning.</TE>
<TE>   The game between No. 9 Georgia and South Carolina at
Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, S.C., was suspended for 52
minutes because of heavy rain and lightning before the Bulldogs
completed their 13-7 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The game between 12th-ranked Florida and 42-point underdog Ohio
was halted for 46 minutes because of lightning--with Ohio leading,
3-0. (The Gators returned to the field and took care of business,
34-6.)</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the Indiana-Kentucky and Army-Rutgers games--and far
from tropical storm territory, the Texas El Paso-Oklahoma game--also
were stopped temporarily because of severe weather.</TE>
<TE>   It was a decent day for Hurricanes and Cyclones, however: No. 1
Miami overcame its own sloppy play in a 44-21 victory over Temple,
and Iowa State came from 17 points behind at halftime to beat Iowa,
36-31.</TE>
<TE>   Big Win, Big Loss</TE>
<TE>   Nevada's 31-28 upset of Brigham Young put an end to the sort of
pretensions to BCS glory that BYU had last season.</TE>
<TE>   But Nevada lost star running back Chance Kretschmer to a knee
injury after a late hit out of bounds on his first carry of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Kretschmer, a former rodeo cowboy from Tonopah, Nev., led the NCAA
in rushing last season with 1,732 yards--the first freshman to lead
the nation since Marshall Faulk at San Diego State in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "Chance is going to be out indefinitely with the knee strain,"
Coach Chris Tormey said. "It could be serious.... It doesn't look
good."</TE>
<TE>   Mack Goes Back</TE>
<TE>   Was that big crowd in Chapel Hill there to see Texas Coach Mack
Brown return to North Carolina, or was it just the excitement of
seeing anyone named Roy Williams come to town?</TE>
<TE>   Brown revived a moribund Tar Heel program before leaving to take
over at Texas, where he has the Longhorns in the thick of the
national picture but stuck with a reputation for not winning the big
one.</TE>
<TE>   The North Carolina fans acted like jilted lovers about Brown's
return for a 45-21 Texas victory, wrote Lenox Rawlings of the
Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal.</TE>
<TE>   "Some Carolina players--a dwindling number, five seasons
later--hate Brown because he reneged on his vow to continue coaching
them when the Texas rumors first swirled. Some donors hate Brown
because he took their pledges, revamped the stadium and left before
delivering what they considered appropriate payback. Some folks never
liked Brown's extroverted personality, his incessant chatter or his
salesman's persona.</TE>
<TE>   "You can wrap up all those bad vibes and ship them to the nearest
toxic-waste disposal site. The main reason lots of Carolina people
detest Brown is simple: He shunned them, stopped returning their love
and took up with an attractive alternative."</TE>
<TE>   The Next Generation</TE>
<TE>   Marion Barber III, the son of former Minnesota and NFL player
Marion Barber II, was once listed as the Gophers' starting
quarterback this season.</TE>
<TE>   But Barber didn't even play in Minnesota's 31-21 victory over
Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   His replacement?</TE>
<TE>   Terry Jackson II, who ran for 83 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Heisman History</TE>
<TE>   With Heisman contenders taking themselves out of the running at
every turn--we'll check back with you later, Rex Grossman, Ken
Dorsey, Byron Leftwich--it raised a question.</TE>
<TE>   When was the last time a Pacific 10 player won the award?</TE>
<TE>   Try 1981. It was Marcus Allen for USC.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, five players from the Big 12 have won, four from the
Big Ten, three each from the Southeastern and Big East, two from the
Atlantic Coast, one from the Western Athletic Conference, one from
Houston, now in Conference USA, and one from independent Notre Dame.</TE>

<TE>   'Wins' of Shift</TE>
<TE>   California was one of eight Division I teams that went winless in
conference last season. How those teams, and Navy (winless as an
independent in 2001), have fared this season:</TE>

<HD>Oscar Gets Off the Hook</HD>
<DH>Boxing: De La Hoya, behind early in bout, knocks down
Vargas in the 11th round and finishes him off a few moments later.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>A feud that began in a cold snow bank in Big Bear ended under the hot
lights of the Mandalay Bay Events Center on Saturday night, Fernando
Vargas, blood flowing from a cut under his right eye, defenseless
against the ropes as the man he has repeatedly professed hatred for,
Oscar De La Hoya, responded with 16 unanswered punches.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, mercifully, referee Joe Cortez stepped in and ended the
match at 1:48 of the 11th round, allowing De La Hoya to retain his
World Boxing Council 154-pound championship, capture the World Boxing
Assn. 154-pound title and settle this much-hyped Southern California
feud that had been labeled "Bad Blood."</LD>
<LD>   Both fighters shed blood, De La Hoya's nose sporadically bleeding,
but there was nothing bad about this fight, a much-hyped match that
lived up to expectations for a change.</LD>
<TE>   When it was over, De La Hoya (35-2, 28 knockouts), who hadn't
fought in 15 months and had lost to his last two big-name
opponents--Felix Trinidad and Shane Mosley--had stepped up to a new
level, proving that he could not only regain the form that had earned
him the nickname Golden Boy, but could also could regain the power he
had possessed at the lower weight divisions. He had the only
knockdown, moments before the finish, with a solid left hook.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas (22-2), on the other hand, failed to prove wrong those
critics who questioned his chin after he had been knocked down five
times by Trinidad and once by light-hitting Wilfredo Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   The fight had been billed as De La Hoya's superior speed and
boxing ability against Vargas' power. It was thought that De La Hoya
had to stay out of Vargas' reach, use his superior jab, cut up
Vargas, frustrate him and stay out of reach of those potentially
damaging right-hand punches.</TE>
<TE>   In the first round, Vargas seemed to have torn those pages out of
De La Hoya's playbook. He burrowed in with a left-right combination,
nearly put De La Hoya down, bruised his cheek and perhaps battered
his confidence. Only the ropes, it appeared, prevented De La Hoya
from going down.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas had predicted his power would prove overwhelming. He had
strutted around at the weigh-in as if he were preparing for a
bodybuilding contest.</TE>
<TE>   Had De La Hoya's promise to use his right hand more effectively
than ever and display the defensive tactics taught him by trainer
Floyd Mayweather Sr. been just so much prefight gibberish?</TE>
<TE>   "Vargas was very strong," De La Hoya said. "I had to be patient,
go to the body and use combinations. He really surprised me."</TE>
<TE>   In the second round, De La Hoya came out with the form he had
promised, his jab working smoothly, his footwork sharp, his defensive
skills on display.</TE>
<TE>   And so it went from round to round, first Vargas coming on, and
then De La Hoya responding in the ensuing round.</TE>
<TE>   After the fifth round, De La Hoya's nose bleeding, blood smeared
on his face, Vargas' corner was in a celebratory mood.</TE>
<TE>   "He's yours," Eduardo Garcia, Vargas' trainer, told him in the
corner. "He's liable to quit. You got him."</TE>
<TE>   But few celebrations in the back-and-forth match lasted more than
a round until the end.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth, De La Hoya opened the cut under Vargas' eye and, by
the ninth round, De La Hoya seemed in command.</TE>
<TE>   But suddenly, he seemed to fade. He was backtracking, he looked
tired and he was sitting on his lead.</TE>
<TE>   Hadn't this act been seen before? Was the sellout crowd of 11,425
viewing a replay of De La Hoya's 1999 match against Trinidad when he
danced away for the final three rounds and gave away the match?</TE>
<TE>   Not this time.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, De La Hoya dug down and found a reservoir of strength he
had not shown since he beat Ike Quartey. And in the 10th round, there
was a familiar look on Vargas' face, the look of fatigue. Vargas
looked as he had in December of 2000 when Trinidad had demolished
him.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the 10th round, De La Hoya delivered his most
telling blow of the fight to that point, a left hook that staggered
Vargas, perhaps only the bell saving him from more serious damage.</TE>
<TE>   That damage came in the 11th round.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya, as he has all his career, won the fight with his left
hand. A devastating left hook sent Vargas to the canvas with such
force that his head bounced. De La Hoya was so confident victory was
within his grasp that he did a little dance before heading to the
neutral corner.</TE>
<TE>   His confidence proved justified.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas got up, but his evening was over. The feud was about to be
settled.</TE>
<TE>   According to Vargas, an Oxnard fighter, it had begun in 1993 when
his hero, De La Hoya from East Los Angeles, refused to help him up
after he had fallen in the snow while doing roadwork, laughing
instead as he ran by. De La Hoya claimed he didn't recall the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   No matter, Vargas began a campaign to fight De La Hoya that took
almost a decade to complete.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why Vargas was talking so much. It doesn't
make sense," De La Hoya said. "Imagine Tiger Woods talking bad about
Jack Nicklaus. You should show it in the ring. Let your fists do the
talking. Tonight my fists did the talking."</TE>
<TE>   There was certainly no affection demonstrated between the fighters
before the match, their only contact being a shoving match at a
January news conference.</TE>
<TE>   And there was no contact after the fight, Vargas departing without
speaking, heading for a nearby hospital for a precautionary
examination.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the judges, Paul Smith and Doug Tucker, had De La Hoya
ahead, 96-94, when the fight ended, as did The Times. One judge,
Patricia Jarman-Manning, had Vargas ahead, 97-94.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever she was looking at, she missed a heck of fight.</TE>

<TE>   The 11th Round</TE>
<TE>   What happened: Leading 96-94 on the scorecards of judges Paul
Smith and Doug Tucker and losing 97-94 on Patricia Jarman-Manning's
card, De La Hoya delivered the first hard punch of the round with a
left hook. He topped its effectiveness with another that dropped
Vargas to the mat during the first minute of the round. Referee Joe
Cortez gave Vargas an eight count. De La Hoya charged Vargas toward
the corner with a 16-punch combination--left, right, left,
right--until Vargas turned away. When the blows continued, Cortez
stepped in and stopped the fight.</TE>

ROUND 1  Scoring  D  V</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   The stone-faced De La Hoya lands the first punches, a three-punch
series to Vargas' stomach. He follows with a clean left hook, right
cross combination, and presses with a series of jabs. The pro-Vargas
crowd chants his last name and he responds suddenly, cramming De La
Hoya to the ropes near the left of De La Hoya's corner. Vargas
delivers a punishing left to the body, left to the head and right to
the head that nearly dumps De La Hoya between the second and third
ropes. Vargas capitalizes with a hard right to De La Hoya's left
eyebrow area.</TE>

<TE>   The energy subsides during the first half of the round. Vargas
delivers a stiff left that knocks De La Hoya's head backward. De La
Hoya sneaks in a right, but searches in vain for an effective punch
or combination. In the final 10 seconds, Vargas plants a hurtful left
on De La Hoya's head.</TE>

ROUND 3  Scoring  D  V</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya lands a nice jab to the head, but Vargas dominates
throughout the rest of the minutes. His stiff jab leads to a big
right, a punishing flurry that leaves De La Hoya against the ropes
again. Vargas' big left adds insult to injury, a jab hurts De La Hoya
further. De La Hoya is keeping his gloves tight to his body, as if he
needs rest after the punishment. Vargas continues firing good
punches, including some big rights. De La Hoya's left-right combo
near the end is a weak afterthought.</TE>

<TE>   De La Hoya wants to rely on his hand speed. His fast combinations
score points. De La Hoya gets in a nice left uppercut and big right,
then removes himself from harm. De La Hoya reaches for Vargas'
forehead with an effective left.</TE>

ROUND 5  Scoring  D  V</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya sticks to the jab. Vargas sticks to his effective
right, ducking in a hard punch to the face. He unleashes a hard
right, then slings a left. His punches are more deliberate and more
powerful. Vargas' right eye is swelling, but he isn't fazed. He
corners De La Hoya, beating him with brutal efficiency.</TE>

ROUND 6  Scoring  D  V</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Vargas starts impressively, jamming a left hook to De La Hoya.
There is a cut under Vargas' right eye. De La Hoya is obviously
searching to deliver a fast series of punches. Vargas delivers a
strong combination in the final five seconds of the round. But De La
Hoya smacks Vargas with a strong right after the bell. An upset
Vargas opens his mouth in complaint. De La Hoya tries to touch gloves
as an apology. Vargas refuses.</TE>

ROUND 7  Scoring  D  V</TE>

<TE>   De La Hoya starts with a left to Vargas' forehead, later adding a
jab. The fighters are working hard, sweat is flying from the heads on
every landed punch. De La Hoya's famed left hook lands. Vargas
answers with his big right and two good jabs. Yet, a hard right punch
stings Vargas and a big right takes a big toll. Vargas motions as if
he's fine, banging his gloves together and nodding De La Hoya
forward. Vargas sneaks in a hard right.</TE>

<TE>   De La Hoya is seizing the fight. A hard right hand and two landed
jabs back up Vargas. The first obvious chants of "Oscar" are heard.
His jabs knock Vargas' head backward. Two big shots to the body and a
good right are followed by another hard left to Vargas' midsection.
Vargas is slowing down after being hit in the head again. De La Hoya
is eyeing openings. Vargas' cut eye is bleeding what appears to be a
long, red tear.</TE>

<TE>   De La Hoya's big left hook knocks Vargas back. Still, Vargas is
charging ahead, De La Hoya is backtracking. He stops, sneaks in a big
left, then a punishing body combination of three punches, followed by
a telling left hook to the head that makes Vargas backpedal and
buckles his knees.</TE>

<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   The crowd is more charged than ever before the round starts. The
second of De La Hoya's two left hooks knocks Vargas down next to the
neutral corner. De La Hoya jumps to the other neutral corner as an
eight count is delivered. De La Hoya pounces seconds later, pounding
Vargas in De La Hoya's corner with a 16-punch barrage that started
with a hard left. Vargas looks as if he's trying to turn his head
away from the flurry. After more punishment, referee Joe Cortez steps
in to stop the fight, a technical knockout with 1:12 left.</TE>

<HD>Ruiz Puts Earthquakes Away</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the game that may have determined the championship of Major League
Soccer's Western Conference, the Galaxy and San Jose Earthquakes
played either 93 or 94 scoreless minutes at the Rose Bowl, depending
on whom you talked to.</LD>
<LD>   They will be asking this question for days or at least another
week: Was Carlos Ruiz offside or not on his winning goal in injury
time?</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz gave the Galaxy a 1-0 victory before 32,874 with his goal in
the 94th minute. It was his 23rd goal of the season and eighth
winning goal, an MLS record.</LD>
<TE>   The Earthquakes complained loudly that Ruiz was offside before he
took Cobi Jones' pass into the penalty area, pulled back and calmly
slid the ball past San Jose's onrushing goalkeeper Joe Cannon.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way I can tell for sure unless I saw a replay," Galaxy
Coach Sigi Schmid said. "We certainly lost games with the same sort
of situation occurring, sometimes when you're not sure of a call. If
you're in the game long enough, you'll end up benefiting from it
sometimes and you'll end up losing from it other times, so it all
evens out."</TE>
<TE>   The goal was special--though San Jose would disagree--even by
Ruiz's typical last-minute heroic standards. The victory puts the
Galaxy (15-9-3) three points ahead of San Jose heading into the last
regular-season game, at San Jose, on Saturday. Starting on June 8,
the Galaxy has not lost at home, going 9-0-1 in that stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Before Ruiz's goal, there was a different kind of attack going on.
Attacking soccer, you say?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that's possible, even if there were no goals in the first
half and none until the 94th minute. Instead, the Galaxy and the
Earthquakes went on the attack all right--against each other--in the
second half of a tense standoff between the conference co-leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In the 73rd minute, Galaxy midfielder Chris Albright challenged
Cannon for a ball in the box, sparking a melee. Jeff Agoos came to
the defense of his keeper, pushing Albright, and Ruiz stood up for
Albright.</TE>
<TE>   Yellow cards followed thus, handed out to Albright and Cannon. It
was that kind of unyielding, albeit, frustrating standoff between two
teams, and the irritation eventually got to the Ruiz about 10 minutes
later, as he, too, picked up a yellow card in the 81st minute.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best scoring chance came before the scrap. San Jose's
Landon Donovan hit the corner of the left post and crossbar in the
64th minute.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier exhibition, the Philadelphia Charge and San Diego
Spirit of the Women's United Soccer Assn. played to a 1-1 tie.</TE>

<HD>Kansas State Rout Is a Dunn Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MANHATTAN, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Marc Dunn threw two touchdown passes--both on one-play drives--and
ran for another score as Kansas State beat Eastern Illinois, 63-13,
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Rashad Washington returned an interception 40 yards for a
touchdown and set up another score with a blocked punt for Kansas
State. The Wildcats (3-0) had two touchdowns before taking their
first snap--on Danny Morris' three-yard return of Washington's
blocked kick and Terence Newman's 95-yard kickoff return.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Tony Romo was impressive early for Eastern Illinois
(0-2), completing 13 of 14 passes for 120 yards and a touchdown in
the first quarter. But after that, Romo had three passes
intercepted--two leading to touchdowns--including Washington's
scoring return for a 50-13 lead in the third quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Kansas State didn't take control of Eastern Illinois, ranked
eighth in Division I-AA, until the second quarter. That's when Dunn
broke the game open, running two yards for a touchdown and throwing a
19-yard scoring pass to Thomas Hill less than two minutes later to
put Kansas State ahead, 29-13.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn was three for four for 67 yards, playing only the first half
and one series in the second. Third-stringer Jeff Schwinn started the
second half and threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to James Terry midway
through the third quarter for a 56-13 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's scoring catch from Dunn came one play after Eastern
Illinois punter Tom Schofield threw an incomplete pass on fourth and
eight from the Eastern Illinois 19.</TE>
<TE>   Darren Sproles scored on a 54-yard run and Taco Wallace caught a
58-yard touchdown pass from Dunn later in the second quarter, giving
the Wildcats a 43-13 halftime lead. Sproles' run came two plays after
Bobby Wallace intercepted a Romo pass and returned it 31 yards to the
Wildcat 40.</TE>
<TE>   Morris scored on a blocked punt return for the second consecutive
game. He also returned one 16 yards for a score in last week's 68-0
rout of Louisiana Monroe.</TE>

<HD>Norstrom Signs for Four Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe; Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving to avoid a potentially messy situation, the Kings on Saturday
tore up the final year of Mattias Norstrom's contract and signed
their captain and top defenseman to a four-year, $14.5-million deal.</LD>
<LD>   Norstrom, who would have been eligible for unrestricted free
agency next summer, agreed to a deal that will pay him $2.5 million
this season, up from the $2 million he was due under his previous
contract. He'll make $4.5 million in the 2003-04 season, $4 million
in '04-05 and $3.5 million in '05-06.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, the Kings failed to come to terms with their
captain, free-agent-to-be Rob Blake, and the situation turned ugly,
putting a drag on the team until Blake was traded to the Colorado
Avalanche in February 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike Blake, his close friend Norstrom, 30, is neither a
superstar nor much of a scoring threat, but the 6-foot-2, 220-pound
Swede plays with a determination that exemplifies a team known as
much for its tenacity as its talent.</TE>
<TE>   Norstrom, a two-time Olympian, and Aaron Miller were the defensive
stalwarts last season as the Kings established a club record with a
2.29 goals-against average and ranked third in the league in penalty
killing with the second-best success rate in franchise history.
Norstrom, perhaps the Kings' most physically fit player, averaged
more than 23 minutes a game, tops on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "We're glad to have him make the commitment to our team," General
Manager Dave Taylor said Saturday. "He's our captain and a tremendous
role model."</TE>
<TE>   Norstrom, who has sat out the first two days of training camp
after suffering a concussion during a fall to the ice last week, said
he had looked forward to unrestricted free agency but his first
choice was to stay with the Kings. The club, he said, broached the
idea of a new contract about two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The signing of their captain leaves the Kings with four potential
unrestricted free agents next summer--Miller, goaltender Felix Potvin
and forwards Bryan Smolinski and Craig Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For Brian Gornick, hockey will not just be a job, it will be an
adventure. Gornick, a ninth-round draft pick by the Mighty Ducks in
1999, will split time between minor league Cincinnati and the Air
Force this season. He graduated first in his class at the Air Force
Academy in May and left training camp Saturday to report to
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside of Dayton, Ohio, to begin a
two-year commitment.</TE>
<TE>   He is the first military academy graduate to be drafted by an NHL
team.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing his hockey career will require military-like precision.
Gornick must balance a 40-hour-a-week job as an acquisition officer
with being a center for an American Hockey League team. It will
involve a 45-minute drive from Dayton to Cincinnati each day.</TE>
<TE>   "The Air Force officials are willing to work something out,"
Gornick said. "I'll go to work at 6 a.m., then take off to go
practice, then come back and work into the evening. Instead of
working Monday through Friday, I'll work a seven-day week."</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force made a similar arrangement with goalie Marc
Kielkucki, who was Gornick's roommate. Kielkucki signed as a free
agent with the San Jose Sharks last year and played for Dayton in the
East Coast Hockey League. Gornick selected Wright-Patterson because
of its proximity to the Ducks' minor league affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   Gornick is the second cadet to be drafted. Colorado took Dan
Hinote, from West Point, in the ninth round in 1996. But Highnote
left the academy after his freshman year to pursue a hockey career.
Gornick stuck around and finished with 45 goals and 103 points in
four seasons. He also finished with a 3.92 grade-point average and a
degree in operations research.</TE>

<HD>There's Willingham and a Way for Irish</HD>
<DH>Nonconference: Notre Dame scores an offensive touchdown and
improves to 3-0 with 25-23 victory over Michigan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Chapter Three of the Tyrone Willingham story continued to be suitable
for youngsters' bedtime reading. Yet another happy ending.</LD>
<LD>   The new coach of the Notre Dame football team, not the first
choice of the good priests here when he was hired to take over the
debris of predecessor Bob Davie nor a particularly inspired solution
in the minds of many of the demanding Irish alumni who make big noise
and write big checks, is now 3-0 and heading toward a top 10 ranking.</LD>
<LD>   The mysteriously soft-spoken Willingham, who left a great job on
the Farm at Stanford to come to the Zoo at South Bend, guided his
lightly regarded Fighting Irish to a surprising 25-23 victory over
No. 7 Michigan here Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The game attracted the usual 80,795 on a cloudy, humid afternoon.
That marked the 163rd consecutive sellout at Notre Dame Stadium, and
when the game ended moments after Shane Walton had made his second
huge play with a clinching interception, a sizable portion of that
sellout crowd poured onto the field. They surrounded the Irish
players, celebrating at midfield with gold helmets held high in one
hand, and created a scene that was reminiscent of, well, when they
used to win a lot around here.</TE>
<TE>   The scene was so wild that Willingham, asked afterward what he
thought as he completed a postgame TV interview on the field and
looked up at what was going on, said, "Help."</TE>
<TE>   It is this sort of understated approach to one of the more
overstated jobs in American sports that has both dazzled and
bewildered Irish fans. The mandate of this job has always been
equally divided between winning a lot and talking a lot. Think Lou
Holtz. Rockne. Even Gerry Faust, who did the latter a lot better than
the former.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham speaks softly and, apparently, carries an inspirational
big stick with his players. Notre Dame came into this game with two
victories, but Maryland was not as strong as last year's bowl group
and Purdue won't be used a lot in the same sentence this season with
the initials BCS.</TE>
<TE>   But Michigan was different. The Wolverines also entered this game
2-0, but with a No. 7 national ranking, 13 spots above the Irish.</TE>
<TE>   Couple that with the fact that Notre Dame had won two games
without scoring an offensive touchdown--287 days since the last Irish
offensive touchdown last Dec. 1--and it was clear that much was on
the line for the Willingham regime.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish took care of that story line quickly. Willingham sent
quarterback Carlyle Holiday back to pass on the first two plays of
the game. On the second, he found wide receiver Maurice Stovall for
41 yards and nine plays later, and less than five minutes into the
game, Ryan Grant ran two yards for a touchdown and the monkey was off
Willingham's back.</TE>
<TE>   In the press box, the public address announcer intoned: "That is
an OFFENSIVE touchdown for the University of Notre Dame."</TE>
<TE>   That done, a football game broke out.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan tied the score, 7-7, when Holiday threw an ill-advised
pass into the flat that the Wolverines' Marlin Jackson turned into a
19-yard interception and touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   It was shortly after this that Michigan made the first of two
questionable plays that created the eventual margin of victory.</TE>
<TE>   The first was by offensive tackle Courtney Morgan, a 300-pound
junior from Los Angeles and Westchester High. With his quarterback
back to throw in his end zone, and Notre Dame end Justin Tuck drawing
a bead on John Navarre, Morgan reached out and grabbed Tuck. His only
chance was the officials not seeing, because if they did, holding in
the end zone is an automatic safety.</TE>
<TE>   The officials saw it, and Notre Dame led, 9-7. And the ensuing
post-safety punt helped Notre Dame's field position so that a fumble
a few minutes later led to a scoring quarterback draw by Holiday and
a 16-7 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan fought back to a 17-16 lead, getting its big chance when
Arnaz Battle, the quarterback turned wide receiver, fumbled a kickoff
return on his 32-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   But the feast-or-famine Irish, now acting like some sort of
offensive scoring machine, cranked up two long pass plays to Omar
Jenkins, of 29 yards and then 47, and Notre Dame, which hadn't
trailed for one moment this season until Michigan caught up, was back
on top in exactly 2:03. Grant, the sophomore running back who had his
best game with 143 yards, scored his second touchdown from three
yards out, making the Irish lead 22-17. It stayed that way when
Willingham went for two and Holiday was sacked.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the Wolverines made their second questionable play, this one
by Coach Lloyd Carr, who declined a holding penalty that might have
forced a 56-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Carr chose to force fourth down, and Nick Setta connected on the
46-yarder that made it 25-17.</TE>
<TE>   Carr said he made his decision because "a touchdown would have put
us out of the game," and that he thought Setta "would have made it
from 56, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   So that brought the game down to a dramatic 11-play, 81-yard drive
by the Wolverines that ended when Navarre passed to tight end Bennie
Joppru for a touchdown with 2:44 left. That meant Michigan had to go
for two for the tie, and Walton was there to save the day for the
Irish, batting down Navarre's quick out-pattern to Braylon Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan got the ball back one more time, with about a minute and
a half left, but that threat ended when Navarre's arm was hit on a
pass and the ball floated, fittingly, to Walton.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the green-shirted students were storming the field by the
thousands and Willingham was being Willingham.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the future, he said, "I don't have a five-year plan. I
used to live in the Bay Area. I know about things like dot.coms."</TE>
<TE>   Asked another question geared to get him to become philosophical
and teary-eyed over his 3-0 start, he smiled and said, "I'm sorry. I
know you guys want me to elaborate on things. But it's a lot simpler
than that. I'm just about winning. However that happens is fine."</TE>

<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Every 108 years or so, Washington State sneaks to No. 10 in the
national polls in September, gets a chance to come to a place like
this and make news beyond the greater Spokane metropolitan area.</LD>
<LD>   The magnitude of the moment obviously hit the visitors Saturday in
the late afternoon sun, when No. 6 Ohio State got smart, handed the
ball to Maurice Clarett and outscored Washington State, 19-0, en
route to a 25-7 win before a record crowd of 104,553 at Ohio Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Clarett, a true freshman, ran 31 times for 230 yards, 194 after
intermission, in a performance that exhausted Washington State and
its not-so-farfetched national title hopes.</LD>
<TE>   "We had a chance to play in the big arena, the big show, and we
didn't get it done," Washington State Coach Mike Price said. "Simple
as that."</TE>
<TE>   Not that simple, exactly.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State (2-1) started out as if it belonged in the arena,
driving 80 yards for a touchdown on its opening possession and giving
no indication it would be the Cougars' only score of the game.</TE>
<TE>   For a half, Washington State's spread offense poked holes in the
Ohio State defense while the Cougar defense stood firm in a hostile
atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State led, 7-6, after 30 minutes, and it would have
been more had the Cougars not botched a center snap on a short field
goal try right before the half.</TE>
<TE>   Price couldn't have been more pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were right there," he said. "We thought it would be
just fine."</TE>
<TE>   He was wrong, of course, as Ohio State (3-0) turned the clock back
30 years and pretended it was Woody Hayes on the sideline and Archie
Griffin around end.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett carried 20 times in the second half and shed Washington
State tacklers the way a snake sheds skin.</TE>
<TE>   On the Buckeyes' first third-quarter possession, Clarett rushed
for 74 yards in four carries on a 91-yard drive that ended with his
three-yard touchdown to put his team up, 13-7.</TE>
<TE>   His scoring dash was set up by a 20-yard burst in which he bowled
over two Washington State defenders, Jason David and Erik Coleman,
before being run out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Nugent added his third field goal, a 44-yarder, later in the
quarter to make it 16-7, and then the wheels came off the Pullman
cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   It started when Troy Bienemann's center snap on a punt sailed
through the end zone and halfway to Dayton for a safety to make it
18-7.</TE>
<TE>   Then, surprise, Ohio State turned to Clarett to run out the game
in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   After gains of six, four, six, six and six yards, an exhausted
Clarett, his legs cramping, limped to the Buckeye bench, but he
wasn't out for long.</TE>
<TE>   After quarterback Craig Krenzel ran 29 yards on a bootleg to the
Washington State one-yard line, Clarett ran back on the field and
scored on first and goal with 10:41 left to make it 25-7.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be tough in the Big Ten," Clarett said. "I knew I had
to suck it up and keep playing through it. Coach [Jim] Tressel says
it's a privilege to carry the ball at Ohio State, and I want to make
the most of every opportunity I get."</TE>
<TE>   To a man, Washington State described Clarett, 6 feet and 230
pounds, as a load.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars did a decent job of surrounding Clarett, the way you
would a wild buck, but not wrapping up on tackles. On some runs,
Clarett simply moved the pile four and five yards before going down.</TE>
<TE>   "He carried that team today," Cougar defensive tackle Rien Long
said. "We went to five-man fronts and he still found ways to break
through. I saw his number plenty of times going down the field, and I
didn't like that too much."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem was Washington State's supposedly dynamic
offense locked up after its opening touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The passing seams quarterback Jason Gesser had in the first half
were sewn shut by a defense that refused to bite on a lot of the
kitchen-sink plays the team likes to use.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser, who was trying to forward his Heisman Trophy campaign
here, finished having completed 25 of 44 passes with one touchdown
and two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser took more and more shots as the game wore on and he wore
out.</TE>
<TE>   "I take full blame for this game for not putting points on the
board," Gesser said. "Because we really had our chances."</TE>
<TE>   Gesser's last chance ended with 7:10 left, when his
fourth-and-three pass from the Ohio State 14 was intercepted by Tyler
Everett.</TE>
<TE>   Before heading back to Pullman, Washington State would gripe about
this opportunity lost and even some questionable officiating, notably
a pass interference penalty that was not called on Ohio State near
the end of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   You thought the Ohio State defensive players talked tough?</TE>
<TE>   Gesser said that was nothing compared to the men in stripes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was talking trash to the refs because they were talking trash
to me," an astonished Gesser said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Price also wondered why Clarett was still running down Main Street
with the game already decided.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess he needed more practice because they left him in right to
the end of the game," Price said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State's season certainly did not end here. The team
picked to win the Pacific 10 Conference can still do that, and
perhaps earn a rematch against Ohio State in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   What was lost in Ohio, in September, was a moment Washington State
gets once in a blue harvest moon--the chance to position itself in
the national title race.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything can happen in the BCS," Cougar receiver Scott Lunde
said.</TE>
<TE>   We'll see.</TE>

<HD>No Big Deal, Cal Blows Out Michigan State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California is 3-0 for the first time in six years and has beaten a
top-15 team for the first time in 28 years. Yet the Golden Bears and
first-year Coach Jeff Tedford aren't all that impressed with
themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Cal quarterback Kyle Boller accounted for four touchdowns--two
throwing, one running and one receiving--as the Golden Bears humbled
15th-ranked Michigan State, 46-22, Saturday at East Lansing, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   The last time the Bears beat such a highly ranked team was Oct. 5,
1974, when they defeated No. 14 Illinois. Cal is 3-0 for the first
time since 1996, which was Coach Steve Mariucci's only season before
leaving for the San Francisco 49ers.</LD>
<TE>   Despite tripling last year's win total, the Golden Bears were
businesslike after first silencing, then emptying, Spartan Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we need to be surprised or giddy about winning,"
said Tedford, who was the offensive coordinator at Oregon the last
four years before taking over for Tom Holmoe, who was fired.</TE>
<TE>   The Spartans (2-1) fell behind for the second consecutive week,
but unlike their victory over Rice, they couldn't mount a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys weren't ready to play. We never even showed up,"
Michigan State Coach Bobby Williams said. "It's very frustrating. I'm
mostly disappointed in myself. I'll take the hit. Put it all on me."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears stunned Williams' team by scoring 18 second-quarter
points and taking a 25-0 lead at halftime. The scores came on a punt
return, a safety, a trick play and three field goals.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State opened the second half with two touchdowns, but Cal
responded with three consecutive touchdowns to wrap up the win.</TE>
<TE>   Boller was 19 of 33 for 232 yards with two touchdowns and an
interception. He caught a 14-yard touchdown pass from receiver
LaShaun Ward in the second quarter and scored the first of Cal's
three second-half touchdowns on a two-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Charles Rogers might have been the only Michigan State
player who didn't have an awful game.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers caught nine passes for 166 yards and a touchdown. He has
caught at least one touchdown pass in his last 11 regular-season
games--one short of the NCAA record held by Marshall's Randy Moss,
Michigan's Desmond Howard and Pacific's Aaron Turner.</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Oregon 58, Idaho 21--Onterrio Smith ran for three
touchdowns and Jason Fife threw two touchdown passes to lead the
Ducks (3-0) at Eugene, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks got off to a slow start, gaining only 36 yards of
offense in the first quarter, but took command before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Smith finished with 104 yards rushing in 18 carries and Fife
completed 10 of 22 passes for 232 yards without an interception.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho is 0-3.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State 47, Nevada Las Vegas 17--Derek Anderson matched a
school record with five touchdown passes as the Beavers (3-0) won at
Corvallis, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, a sophomore in his first season as the Beavers' starter,
completed 20 of 26 passes for 356 yards. His five touchdown passes
tied the mark set by Erik Wilhelm against Akron in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford 63, San Jose State 26--Teyo Johnson caught two touchdown
passes and J.R. Lemon ran for three scores as Stanford dominated in
Coach Buddy Teevens' home debut at Stanford. Kenneth Tolon ran for
two touchdowns to help the Cardinal (1-1) roll to its highest-scoring
game in nearly 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Matter, filling in again for Chris Lewis, passed for 123
yards and ran for a score while leading Stanford to five straight
touchdowns in the second half. Last week, Matter played while Lewis
was suspended; this week, he took over when Lewis was injured late in
the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 39, San Diego State 28--Andrew Walter threw four
touchdown passes and the Sun Devils (3-1) won at San Diego. Adam Hall
passed for 516 yards and three touchdowns for the Aztecs (0-3).</TE>
<TE>   Shaun McDonald had catches of 72, 33, 29 and 16 yards to match the
Arizona State record for touchdown receptions in a game that he
shares with John Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 23, Utah 17--Jason Johnson threw for 416 yards and two
touchdown passes, and Sean Keel kicked three field goals to help the
Wildcats (2-0) win at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Utah (2-1) moved from its 28 to the Arizona three in the final
minutes and appeared to have scored a touchdown when Josh Lyman made
a diving catch of Lance Rice's 12-yard pass in the back of the end
zone, but the referee ruled he came down out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   On fourth and one from the three, Rice pitched to J.R. Peroulis,
who was tackled by Clay Hardt for a two-yard loss with 28 seconds to
play to preserve the victory.</TE>

<LD>News item/rumor: San Diego Chargers reportedly considering a move to
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   News item/rumor: Indianapolis Colts reportedly considering a move
to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Reaction: If Los Angeles is going to have a choice in the matter,
it had better first consult the Carpetbagger Consumer Guide:</LD>
<TE>   L.A. CONNECTIONS</TE>
<TE>   Chargers: Chargers spent their first season of existence, 1960, in
L.A. and reached the American Football League's inaugural
championship game. They lost, of course, to Houston, as our politicos
did four decades later. Moved to San Diego in 1961. Now edging their
way back up the coast with plan to move next summer's training camp
to Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Colts: As Baltimore Colts, used to be Western Conference and
Coastal Division rivals of the Rams until the 1970 NFL-AFL merger.
Last set foot inside the Coliseum in 1991, losing to Raiders, 16-0.</TE>
<TE>   CAN THEY WIN THE BIG ONE?</TE>
<TE>   Chargers: Not since 1963, when the Chargers, in their third season
in San Diego, defeated the Boston Patriots, 51-10, in the AFL
championship game. The Chargers played in five of the AFL's first six
title games, going 1-4 from 1960-1965. Very similar to the Rams circa
1969-1979.</TE>
<TE>   Colts: Not since 1971, when Colts, winding down the Johnny Unitas
era, defeated Dallas, 16-13, in Super Bowl V. Went 1-1 against New
York in two of the biggest pro football games ever played--beating
the Giants in overtime for the 1958 NFL title and losing to Joe
Namath's Jets in Super Bowl III a decade later.</TE>
<TE>   CAN THEY GET TO THE BIG ONE?</TE>
<TE>   Chargers: Not since the 1994 season, when they made their only
Super Bowl appearance, a 49-26 loss to San Francisco. Ominous: The
Chargers' last appearance in the playoffs was a 1995 wild-card loss
to the Colts.</TE>
<TE>   Colts: See Super Bowl V. Baltimore had to wait XXX years, and
import another team, to experience the Super Bowl again. Indianapolis
never has. The '95 Colts got close but lost to Pittsburgh in the AFC
final.</TE>
<TE>   CAN THEY BEAT THE COWBOYS AND THE VIKINGS?</TE>
<TE>   (Exceedingly important to L.A. old-timers.)</TE>
<TE>   Chargers: Doesn't look promising. Chargers are 2-5 against the
Cowboys, 4-4 against the Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   Colts: Better. Colts are 5-7 against the Cowboys, but one of the
victories was the Super Bowl, and 13-7-1 against the Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   STAR POWER</TE>
<TE>   (Exceedingly important to L.A. new-timers)</TE>
<TE>   Chargers: Top marquee name is a linebacker. Junior Seau is a
famous USC alum, but he's now winding down a Hall of Fame career.
Next biggest name, Doug Flutie, is featured on front of cereal boxes
but is now riding the bench as he approaches 40. Too early to tell on
Drew Brees and LaDainian Tomlinson.</TE>
<TE>   Colts: Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James, Marvin Harrison. Colts over
Chargers in a rout.</TE>
<TE>   FLASH FACTOR</TE>
<TE>   Chargers: Currently coached by Marty Schottenheimer, whose teams
specialize in controlling the line of scrimmage, controlling the ball
on the ground and losing early in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Colts: Manning, James, Harrison. Added bonus: The gold in James'
smile. Colts over Chargers in a rout.</TE>
<TE>   ON THE SCHEDULE</TE>
<TE>   Chargers: Still a member of the AFC West, which would mean the
local return of Kansas City Coach Dick Vermeil (call the UCLA Alumni
Assn.), Denver quarterback Steve Beuerlein (call the relatives) and
the Raiders (call the police).</TE>
<TE>   Colts: Just were realigned into the AFC South, which would mean an
instant rivalry with the Houston Texans (the expansion team that went
away) and explaining to the children why Los Angeles is in the same
division with Jacksonville and Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   CHANCES OF WINNING IMMEDIATELY IN L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Chargers: Haven't had a winning season since 1995. Won one game in
2000, won five in 2001. But with Brees, Tomlinson and now, at last,
Quentin Jammer on board, prospects sound a lot like the Clippers'.</TE>
<TE>   Colts: New Coach Tony Dungy is trying to rebuild the defense but
needs time. Consensus is that the Colts are a year away. The timing
could be perfect.</TE>
<TE>   CHANCES OF DRAGGING THE GOOD NAME OF L.A. THROUGH THE MUD OF
NATIONAL RIDICULE</TE>
<TE>   Chargers: Historically speaking, could happen at any minute.</TE>
<TE>   Colts: Haven't been really bad--i.e., 2000 Chargers bad--since
they went 1-15 in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   DO WE REALLY WANT THEM?</TE>
<TE>   Chargers: Let's do training camp in July and we'll get back to
you.</TE>
<TE>   Colts: Hold somebody below 340 yards and we'll talk.</TE>
<TE>   Dwayne Rudd's  Place in History</TE>
<TE>   Counting down the 10 greatest gaffes in pro football history....</TE>
<TE>   10. Bob Griese drops back ... and back ... and back. Trying to
avoid the rush in Super Bowl VI, Miami quarterback scrambles out of a
short loss and into an eventual 29-yard sack in an eventual 24-3
Dallas victory.</TE>
<TE>   9. Dave Smith's premature spike. Smith, a Pittsburgh wide
receiver, is cruising in for an easy score against Kansas City during
the fourth quarter of a one-sided 1971 Monday night game and spikes
the ball on the five-yard line. The ball bounds through the end zone
for a touchback. Steelers close out a 38-16 defeat.</TE>
<TE>   8. Abner Haynes wins toss, elects to kick into the wind. A brain
cramp, for sure, occurring after the end of regulation in the 1962
AFL title game between Haynes' Dallas Texans and the Houston Oilers.
Fortunately for Haynes, Houston doesn't score and Dallas wins on a
field goal in the second overtime period.</TE>
<TE>   7. Garo Yepremian gets wild, crazy. Miami kicker doesn't know what
to do with the football after a field-goal attempt in Super Bowl VII
goes awry, so he makes the worst possible choice: trying to throw it.
Ball slips out of his hands, winds up in the arms of Washington's
Mike Bass, who takes it in for the Redskins' only points in a 14-7
Dolphin win.</TE>
<TE>   6. Leon Lett lets loose too soon. Rumbling in for a
fumble-recovery touchdown in Super Bowl XXVII, Dallas defensive
lineman starts waving the ball around before crossing the goal line.
Buffalo receiver Don Beebe makes a long recovery run, swats the ball
from Lett's paw and the ball rolls out of the end zone for a
touchback. Dallas still wins, 52-17.</TE>
<TE>   5. Bill Gramatica jumps for joy, lands on injured reserve. Getting
a little too excited over a first-quarter field goal in a meaningless
December game in 2001, Arizona kicker tears knee ligaments and is
done for the season.</TE>
<TE>   4. Jim Marshall's wrong-way run. Marshall's mistake--picking up a
San Francisco fumble, getting turned around and running it back all
the way for a Minnesota safety in 1964--is pro football legend, but
it didn't cost his team much in the long run. Minnesota still won the
game, 27-22.</TE>
<TE>   3. Jerome Bettis calls tails, Phil Luckett hears heads. Pittsburgh
wins the coin toss to begin overtime against Detroit on Thanksgiving
Day 1998, but referee Luckett mistakenly gives the Lions the choice
to receive. They do, and minutes later, Jason Hanson kicks the
game-winning field goal.</TE>
<TE>   2. Joe Pisarcik doesn't take a knee. Needing only that to ice a
1978 victory over Philadelphia, New York Giant quarterback instead
runs the play sent in from the sideline--not his fault there; he was
only doing his job--and fumbles the intended handoff. Eagle Herman
Edwards recovers and runs it back for the game-winning touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   1. Dwayne Rudd throws his helmet. Or as someone on the field
should have warned him, "If that helmet comes down, you won't be
winning the game you thought you won." The greatest blunder ever in
an NFL game, especially if Cleveland misses making the playoffs by
one defeat.</TE>

<LD>   Fernando Vargas may want to borrow a pair for his battered and

<LD>   Too much golf?</LD>
<TE>   Maybe that explains why Vargas appeared to have been clubbed with

<TE>   Chicken De La Hoya?</TE>
<TE>   On a brutally redemptive Saturday night, Vargas and a boxing world
full of critics--including this one--choked on it.</TE>
<TE>   His reputation challenged, his machismo questioned, his career in
jeopardy, Oscar De La Hoya made everything right. Then left. Then
right. Then left.</TE>
<TE>   Right, left, right, left ... on it went for 16 consecutive punches
in an 11th-round flurry that finished Fernando Vargas in a knockout

<TE>   Flattened forever was the notion that De La Hoya is not tough

<TE>   Pounded into the canvas was the idea that De La Hoya is not

<TE>   Buried under the streets of East Los Angeles was the belief that

<TE>   The next moment, like many other experts, they were loudly
unafraid to admit they were wrong, changing their tune to, "Os-car,
Os-car, Os-car."</TE>
<TE>   In less than an hour, De La Hoya tore through the criticism of a
career.</TE>
<TE>   With one final punch, he silenced a voice that has haunted him for
years.</TE>
<TE>   At which point, he spit out his red mouthpiece, stuck out his
tongue and danced smiling and preening across the ring with the
innocent jubilation of a kid who had just found a bike.</TE>
<TE>   A fighter who had finally discovered himself.</TE>
<TE>   "This has to go down as Oscar's statement," said promoter Bob
Arum. "The fight that marked him as a real fighter."</TE>
<TE>   Bad blood?</TE>
<TE>   For the last several months, it was Vargas who drew it, stirred
it, spread it.</TE>
<TE>   It was only fitting that, in the end, it was Vargas who wore it.</TE>
<TE>   The kid began the promotion nine months ago by shoving De La Hoya
at a news conference. He ended it Saturday by hanging limply on the
ropes, referee Joe Cortez pressed up against him to protect him from
further blows.</TE>
<TE>   The kid who glared and screeched and stalked De La Hoya wound up
woozy and unable to speak.</TE>
<TE>   The kid who said he was willing to die in the ring killed only his
reputation as the toughest guy on our Southland block.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very satisfying to see him ... I know it sounds a little
bad, but it was like chopping down a tree," De La Hoya said. "It felt
pretty good ... he was talking too much. I did my talking with my
fists."</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya won a fight in the one fashion that few thought he
could win it.</TE>
<TE>   He struggled in the early rounds, wide-eyed and seemingly stunned
at Vargas' powerful punches that bounced him off the ropes.</TE>
<TE>   But he recovered in the middle rounds, dancing and ducking and
wearing Vargas down with his style.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the fight in the ninth round, De La Hoya then seemed to
start running, making folks wonder if this wasn't going to be a
repeat of his late debacle against Felix Trinidad.</TE>
<TE>   But again, he recovered, knocking Vargas down with a left hook at
the start of the 11th round before pounding him into submission at
the end.</TE>
<TE>   The guy who wasn't strong enough to survive an early flurry, he
survived.</TE>
<TE>   The guy who wasn't inspired to keep fighting with a lead, he
fought.</TE>
<TE>   The guy who was too nice to win was meaner than a Vargas tattoo.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I hit him with a jab, I saw his face squint, so I knew
I was getting to him," De La Hoya said. "In the 11th round, I decided
to feint the jab and use the left hook, and he fell for it."</TE>
<TE>   And De La Hoya did it with class. One of the most amazing things
about this new Oscar is that it did not obliterate the old Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   When he hit Vargas with a punch after the bell in the sixth round,
he actually stuck out his hand in an apology.</TE>
<TE>   And the first thing he did afterward was offer compliments.</TE>
<TE>   "Vargas was a very, very strong puncher," De La Hoya said in the
ring. "I was patient, I went to the body, I had to use combinations.
His strength really surprised me."</TE>
<TE>   This being his first fight in 15 months, De La Hoya's commitment
and endurance were even more surprising.</TE>
<TE>   Every time it appeared that Vargas was one punch from a knockdown,
De La Hoya punched first. After every Vargas charge, De La Hoya
regrouped and charged back.</TE>
<TE>   According to this scorecard, at the time of the technical knockout
at 1:48 of the 11th round, Vargas could still have fought to a draw
if he had won the last two rounds. Two of the three judges agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Looked to me like he took a lot of punishment on the ropes in the
early rounds, but then he came out of it and fought a great fight,"
Arum said.</TE>
<TE>   Which could now lead to more great fights, if De La Hoya's
pre-fight pronouncements are to be believed.</TE>
<TE>   He said that before he retired, he wanted to avenge losses to
Shane Mosley and Felix Trinidad, then move up to challenge
middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   This means Mosley, after he fights an easier opponent for his
debut at 154 pounds, could show up on De La Hoya's card next spring.</TE>
<TE>   As for Vargas, he did not show up after the fight, as he was busy
being carted to a hospital. Yet he fought well, deserved the cheers,
and belongs again on this sort of stage.</TE>
<TE>   Just not with De La Hoya, a man renewed, a Chicken no more.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Mike Williams is a freshman, big and tall and confident in his
talents as a receiver and in the possibilities of the USC offense.</LD>
<LD>   Carson Palmer is a senior, hardened by failures and injuries and
second-guessing and changes in coaches and strategies, realistic in
his talents as a quarterback and in the possibilities of the USC
offense.</LD>
<LD>   Hershel Dennis is a freshman, chiseled in muscle, quick as can be,
from a high school program that hardly ever lost, confident in his
talents as a tailback and in the possibilities of the USC offense.</LD>
<TE>   Sultan McCullough is a senior, never quite sure if all his body
parts are pain-free and sound, battered and bruised by four years of
punishment, hopeful that his talents will take him through a whole
season and hopeful about the possibilities of the USC offense.</TE>
<TE>   They've known failure, Palmer and McCullough, so they stood in
different corners of the visitor's locker room at Colorado with
serious faces. They spoke of the mistakes--dropped passes, missed
blocks, flamboyant goofs in the special teams play--and cautioned
that the miscues need to be fixed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of things to clean up," Palmer said. If you
hadn't watched the Trojans, 2 1/2-point underdogs, dismantle
Colorado, 40-3; if you hadn't seen Palmer execute a perfect opening
drive, five for five for 80 yards and a 32-yard touchdown pass to
Malaefou MacKenzie; if you hadn't seen the Trojans have an extra
point, a field goal and a punt blocked in succession and move
blithely on with almost no damage; if you hadn't seen the wondrous
hands and body control of Williams, 6-5, 210 pounds of strapping
strength, you might have thought Palmer was in mourning.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this is not our best game," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I see lots of room for improvement," McCullough said.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough gained 110 yards and scored on a 62-yard dash that
featured a wonderful cut up the field, and what he saw was where he
could get better and not how great he had been.</TE>
<TE>   It's a good deal these freshmen have.</TE>
<TE>   They are playing--Williams (seven catches for 90 yards); Dennis
(five carries for 32 yards plus one catch for four yards); Winston
Justice, starting right tackle on an offensive line that moves in
sweet unison; strong safety Jason Leach (an interception)--and they
know nothing but winning and they have the seniors to tell them it
won't always be like this.</TE>
<TE>   "We stopped ourselves a couple of times," Palmer says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting to beat a real good team on the road. I can't wait
to watch the films," Williams says.</TE>
<TE>   Of course Palmer is cautious. This is his fifth year at USC. He
is, in some minds, a failure because he isn't already in the pros.
Excuse Palmer if he did not erupt into predictions of a Rose Bowl and
high national rankings, if he did not give out confident predictions
of an undefeated season or a Pac-10 title.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some things to work on before we go to Kansas State,"
Palmer says.</TE>
<TE>   "We're gonna get better and when we do we'll be unstoppable,"
Dennis says.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis comes from Long Beach Poly, where every season the
improvement always came and being unbeatable was the rule and not the
exception.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who has the same body and same confidence and same
athletic promise as Keyshawn Johnson, says that learning this offense
"is not that difficult if you've got a good memory."</TE>
<TE>   It's good to be young and wearing a towel around your waist and
showing a body unscarred, with a spirit unbroken and with nothing but
great expectations. "This offense is only going to get better. This
team is only going to get better," Williams says.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we can play a lot better," Palmer says. "I hope I can play
a lot better."</TE>
<TE>   The freshmen expect to play better. The seniors hope they play
better. It is the perfect mix.</TE>
<TE>   Williams says the best advice he has received "is to have a short
memory."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis says he has taken to heart the message that "you can't let
the mistakes stick with you."</TE>
<TE>   McCullough will tell Dennis that just because the Trojans beat a
ranked team on the road one Saturday does not mean traveling to
Kansas State next week will be equally satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer can explain to Williams that the fun of being a hotshot
freshman can end in an instant, that the glorious praise and happy
pats on the back can turn so quickly into doubts and injuries and
puzzlement.</TE>
<TE>   "Hershel and Mike are great threats," Palmer says. "For freshmen
they are really contributing a lot quickly and they show nothing but
promise. But they still have a lot to learn and a lot to go through,
believe me."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer doesn't smile as he performs his postgame chore of
describing what happened. He used to smile once, when he was a
freshman and what was to come was only going to be good. So Palmer
knows how Williams and Dennis and all the freshmen feel. He will
leave them to their happiness for today. All the seniors will. But
there are more lessons to come.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Utilizes Force of Pollack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a team loaded with offensive stars, Georgia Coach Mark Richt knew
who won this game.</LD>
<LD>   "One of my first observations is that David Pollack is a warrior,"
Richt said.</LD>
<LD>   No one who watched the sophomore defensive end dominate South
Carolina on Saturday would argue.</LD>
<TE>   Pollack recovered a fumble near Georgia's goal line in the second
quarter and then had a strange interception return for a touchdown in
the fourth as the ninth-ranked Bulldogs held on to defeat South
Carolina, 13-7, Saturday at Columbia, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how it happened," Pollack said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither does South Carolina quarterback Corey Jenkins. He was
looking for an open Andrea Gause after dropping into the end zone.
Pollack swarmed over Jenkins but did not appear to get much of the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   "When I hit it," Pollack said, "I noticed it kind of stuck to my
hand."</TE>
<TE>   Pollack recovered a fumble by Andrew Pinnock in the second quarter
on Georgia's three-yard line after Tony Gilbert knocked the ball away
with his helmet.</TE>
<TE>   In the Southeastern Conference opener for both teams, Georgia
(2-0) ended a two-game losing streak to the Gamecocks (1-2), who have
lost two in a row under Coach Lou Holtz for the first time in two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's defense rose up one last time with South Carolina
driving in the final moments. Pinnock, the Gamecocks' goal-line
specialist with 22 career touchdowns, had Jenkins' pitch bounce off
his chest with 12 seconds left. Thomas Davis recovered and Georgia
ran out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of Tropical Storm Hanna delayed the game for 52
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Florida 34, Ohio 6--In a game put on the schedule to build
confidence and maybe break some records, the Gators (2-1) did neither
in a victory over the Bobcats (0-3) at Gainesville, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Led by two touchdowns from Earnest Graham, Florida didn't put
supposedly overmatched Ohio away until early in the fourth quarter of
this waterlogged game that was delayed for 46 minutes because of a
severe thunderstorm.</TE>
<TE>   The victory wasn't secure until Graham took a pitch from Rex
Grossman on an option play and scored a 40-yard touchdown for a 28-6
lead with 13 minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 25 Louisiana State 33, Miami (Ohio) 7--Matt Mauck threw three
touchdown passes as the Tigers (2-1) easily defeated the RedHawks
(1-2) at Baton Rouge, La.</TE>
<TE>   LSU was dominant on the ground as running back LaBrandon Toefield
rushed for 111 yards in 17 carries, as LSU outgained the RedHawks.
207-29, on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Domanick Davis had 51 yards rushing, 35 yards receiving and 116
yards on five punt returns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas 42, South Florida 3--The quarterback duo of Matt Jones
and Tarvaris Jackson completed 17 of 23 passes for 226 yards and
three touchdowns to lead the Razorbacks (2-0) to a rout over the
Bulls (1-2) at Little Rock, Ark.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas capitalized on mistakes for a 21-0 first-quarter lead. In
the second quarter, Jackson and Jones led the Razorbacks on drives of
94 and 92 yards for a 35-0 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alabama 33, North Texas 7--Tyler Watts passed for 161 yards and
ran for 64, and four Alabama players ran for touchdowns to lead the
Crimson Tide (2-1) over the Mean Green (1-2) at Tuscaloosa, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama's defense bottled up North Texas most of the game, holding
the Mean Green to 50 yards rushing and 91 yards passing. Cornelius
Wortham led the Tide's defense with nine tackles, six of them solo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Auburn 31, Vanderbilt 6--Carnell Williams ran for 170 yards and
two touchdowns and the Tigers (2-1, 1-0) returned two fumbles for
scores in a victory over the Commodores (1-2, 0-1) at Auburn, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Williams ran for a 65-yard touchdown late in the third quarter to
help Auburn win its 10th consecutive SEC opener and 11th in a row
over Vanderbilt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State 51, Jacksonville State 13--Kevin Fant threw for
336 yards and three touchdowns--including the longest in school
history, an 89-yarder to Ray Ray Bivines--to lead the Bulldogs (1-1)
to a victory over the Division I-AA Gamecocks (1-1) at Starkville,
Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State's Terrell Grindle had three catches for 118
yards, a career best. Bivines finished with two catches for 109
yards.</TE>

<HD>Awash in a Bloodbath Worthy of Television</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>The glossy pictures in Sports Illustrated will look just great, the
blood streaming down the right cheek of "Ferocious" Fernando Vargas,
a testament to the wonderful brawl and night for all at Mandalay Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Ferocious had talked about dying in the ring if necessary to give
everyone a good time, and right away it looked as if this might be a
wonderful Saturday night to remember. (I wonder if there was a priest
in the house?)</LD>
<LD>   The sweat and blood came together on Oscar De La Hoya, making a
marvelous crimson sheen, the crowd taking pleasure in the two-way
beating featuring L.A. kids all grown up.</LD>
<TE>   Vargas had been thoughtful enough to wear white trunks, so
round-by-round the bloody evidence of effort and pain could mount,
the ringside fans getting their $1,200 worth of flying spittle and
red droplets.</TE>
<TE>   Now, although both boxers weighed the same, De La Hoya looked puny
in comparison to Vargas, who put a massive bruise on the right side
of the Golden Boy's cheek in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Vargas staggered De La Hoya several times in the early
rounds, but then the night turned savage, brutal and delicious for
everyone who loves the sweet science of boxing when the Golden Boy
opened a gash beneath the right eye of Ferocious. It had to be great
TV at home for those who paid for a view of someone's butt-kicking.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya's nose had turned to mush, adding to the excitement in
the ring, and talk about a night of entertainment, can it get any
better than two fierce competitors taking a beating while trying to
knock each other unconscious?</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Boy bopped Ferocious in the face in the eighth, and it
was obvious Vargas wasn't feeling too good at this point, and the
electricity in the arena suggested everyone could smell blood now.</TE>
<TE>   And when the end did come in the 11th, and Ferocious went down as
if he had been shot by a sniper, my first thought was for Dada
footwear, which had chosen to advertise on Vargas' butt, and now he
was lying on his back so nobody could see the ad.</TE>
<TE>   The mob went wild, of course, when Ferocious went 10 toes up, the
ring filled with support personnel and De La Hoya was lifted onto
their shoulders. The Golden Boy tossed a cheeky grin to the camera as
if it was no big deal being paid $14 million for an hour's work, and
somewhere in the mayhem they were either consoling or reviving
Vargas. I presume he was still alive, or I think someone would have
made an announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "A great, great, great fight," shouted fight publicist Bill Caplan
in my ear. "Oscar didn't take this much punishment from Shane
Mosley."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if punishment is the measure of a great, great, great
fight, this is why boxing is such a great sport. And when Vargas gets
back from the hospital, I'm sure he'll tell everyone the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW THE thing about boxing, it seems to bring the best out in some
people.</TE>
<TE>   Example one: Promoter Bob Arum paid for airfare and hotel rooms at
Mandalay Bay for broadcasters representing 15 radio stations across
the country to come here, hype the fight and sell pay-per-view. Arum
said, however, that after their first broadcast, a pair of Chicago
broadcasters from WOJO gambled late into the night and chose to go to
the bathroom where they were sitting in the casino rather than stop
wagering. Mandalay Bay took exception to the kind of behavior you and
I might expect from boxing fans, and evicted the Chicago pair from
the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Arum said he won't be paying for their airfare now, but Don King
probably already has them under contract.</TE>
<TE>   Example two: A column written by Michael Katz for maxboxing.com
raised the hackles of some folks close to boxing this week. Katz, who
was prevented from interviewing De La Hoya in a session for print
journalists, then set his aim on Arum.</TE>
<TE>   Arum survived a plane crash recently, getting off a few seconds
before the craft went up in flames. Katz suggested in his column that
a writer from a Las Vegas newspaper, who was also on the plane, could
have won an award for "long and meritorious service to boxing" in a
landslide if he had remained frozen in the doorway, implying that
would have kept Arum from getting off the burning plane.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AFTER SITTING opposite Bo Derek in her prime for the Hearns-Hagler
fight at Caesars Palace and Raquel Welch in Staples Center for
Mosley-De La Hoya, you can imagine how excited I was to see Jack
Haley at De La Hoya-Vargas. These fights really pull in the big
celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   I also ran into Ryan Leaf, the former quarterback, and asked him
if he will try to play again. "I hate the NFL," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fight officials said all the Wayans brothers were going to be in
attendance for the bout with the exception of the talented one.</TE>
<TE>   One man walked by wearing an orange hat, blazer and shoes, and I
had to do a double-take to make sure it wasn't one of my
brothers-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Then I was faced with a quandary. The polite thing, of course,
when someone notices someone's zipper is down is to tell them, but a
woman walked by with the zipper on her dress pulled down to her
bellybutton and I couldn't be sure if it was an accident or she was
here with Laker owner Jerry Buss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from F:</TE>
<TE>   "I usually avoid your stupid words, but I forced myself to read
your boxing story. Even though I'm no thug, it is people like you,
who spout ignorant venom, that makes me wish I could slap you around
for being a shallow idiot."</TE>

<LD>At last, someone devised a defensive strategy to take Gabriel
Batistuta, Christian Vieri, Rivaldo and Hernan Crespo out of the game
and hold them scoreless for weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Sweeper system? Zonal marking? 5-4-1?</LD>
<LD>   Try: This season delayed until the greedheads who run the sport
finally figure out how to split up the television money.</LD>
<TE>   Italy's 2002-03 professional soccer season finally kicked off
Saturday, two weeks after initially scheduled. In the interim, the
nation's fans had to bide their time awaiting the final result in a
much bigger sport: arm-wrestling over television rights.</TE>
<TE>   Now that that dispute has been resolved, Italian fans have been
able to return to the originally scheduled squabbling--starring
players, coaches and the men who own them--which never fails to
provide first-class entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Inter Milan opened its season with a 1-0 home victory over Torino,
which was minor news compared to what Inter opened its season
without: Ronaldo.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's World Cup hero had been Inter property until August, when
Ronaldo, angling for a move to European champion Real Madrid, forced
the issue until the soap opera became too absurd for Inter President
Massimo Moratti.</TE>
<TE>   "He got big-headed," Moratti told the newspaper Repubblica after
agreeing to sell Ronaldo to Real for $43.7 million. "After the World
Cup, he changed. He believed that he had become King again. Ronaldo
only thought of himself, in his personal interest. I'm happy he went
because of this.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe he did it out of self-interest and nothing else. He
went to Real for a fistful of extra coins. It's a ridiculous choice
on this level."</TE>
<TE>   According to Moratti, Ronaldo contributed some coins of his own to
complete the deal. Moratti told Spanish television this week that
Ronaldo paid $5.4 million "out of his own pocket to compensate for
the lost sponsorship money.... We came out very well economically."</TE>
<TE>   The other half of Ronaldo's soccer-playing household, wife Milene
Dominguez, accompanied her husband in her own Italy-to-Madrid
transfer. The 22-year-old Dominguez, a star player for the Italian
women's team Monza, was sent to Atletico Madrid this week for
$310,000, a record for a female soccer player.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo, recovering from a minor knee injury, has yet to play for
his new team. He expects to make his debut during Real's Sept. 25
Champions League opener.</TE>
<TE>   His Name Is Rio</TE>
<TE>   England international defender Rio Ferdinand felt the fallout from
another controversial transfer when his new club, Manchester United,
visited his old one, Leeds, on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Ferdinand, the former Leeds captain, made a $45-million move to
United during the summer upon his request, a transaction equivalent
to treason in the minds of Leeds supporters. During the summer, Leeds
fans unfurled a banner that read, "Rio's Scum, And He Knows He Is!"
Heading into Saturday's match, Ferdinand braced for the worst,
especially after Leeds striker Alan Smith predicted the Elland Road
fans would "hammer" Ferdinand during the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, in an ideal world, you would like the fans to give you
a good reception and hope they remember the good times we had
together," Ferdinand told the Manchester Evening News last week. "But
I am not naive enough to think that is going to happen, because I
will be playing for Manchester United and I will be doing my utmost
to make sure United get the result the players and our fans want."</TE>
<TE>   Elland Road is far from an ideal world. Traditionally home to some
of the most surly fans in England, the Yorkshire stadium lived up to
its reputation during Leeds' 1-0 victory. The home fans taunted
Ferdinand with chants of "Judas" and "Rio, Rio, what's score?" and
booed every time he touched the ball. Police made 11 arrests during
the game for "breach of the peace, drunk and disorderly [conduct] and
disorder" and were investigating claims that United goalkeeper Fabien
Barthez hit a fan by throwing a bottle into the stands.</TE>
<TE>   According to several media reports, Barthez, angered after Harry
Kewell's 66th-minute goal, picked up his plastic water bottle and
kicked it through his goal net, eventually hitting a spectator.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Leeds Manager Terry Venables had urged the team's fans to
ignore Ferdinard because "Rio is not with us any longer. Let's get on
with our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Penalized for Being Good</TE>
<TE>   It's a good thing Pele retired when he did, because there are
referees in Brazil now awarding free kicks against players who
dribble too well and play too creatively.</TE>
<TE>   Strange but true: In Wednesday's Brazilian championship match
between Coritiba and Santos, Coritiba forward Jaba was penalized near
the end of his team's 4-2 victory after taking the ball near the
sideline and toying with it awhile, lifting his foot over the ball a
few times as if he were able to take off dribbling, only to remain in
place.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Leonardo Gaciba cited Jaba for provoking the opposition
and awarded a free kick to Santos.</TE>
<TE>   "The rule says that a player cannot endanger a player or himself,"
Gaciba told the sports daily Lance. "[Jaba] wasn't being objective,
so I awarded a free kick to protect him. If somebody had broken his
leg, they will say that I was not clamping down in violence."</TE>
<TE>   Former World Cup referee Jose Roberto Wright harshly criticized
Gaciba for his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "What Leonardo Gaciba did was absurd," Wright told Reuters. "It
can't happen. What he in fact did was to stamp out the skill of the
player and not the violence of the opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine what would have happened if the referee had given
a free kick every time Garrincha lifted his foot over the ball?"
Wright added, alluding to the Brazilian soccer legend. "There
wouldn't be any football left."</TE>

<HD>There's a New Sprint King</HD>
<DH>Track: Montgomery sets world record of 9.78 seconds in 100
meters, eclipsing the struggling and absent Greene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY HARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Montgomery, who brashly predicted greatness for himself, suddenly
quit talking this summer about becoming the world's fastest man. But
he did not quit pursuing it. On Saturday in Paris, he ran the 100
meters in 9.78 seconds to break fellow American Maurice Greene's
three-year-old world record.</LD>
<LD>   Montgomery, 27, entered the IAAF Grand Prix final focused not on
the record of 9.79 but on merely beating a superb field that included
almost every other great sprinter in the world except for Greene, who
ended his disappointing season last week and was watching from the
stands at Stade Charlety.</LD>
<LD>   But the conditions were optimum for fast times--the tailwind of
2.0 meters per second is maximum for record purposes--and that,
combined with Montgomery's quick start, propelled him to the mark.</LD>
<TE>   Great Britain's Dwain Chambers, who has dueled Montgomery this
season for sprint supremacy, was second in 9.87, equaling compatriot
Linford Christie's European record. American Jon Drummond was third
in 9.97.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was in great shape, and everything was just perfect,"
said Montgomery, a training partner of Marion Jones in Raleigh, N.C.
"The wind was perfect, my reaction time [to the gun] was almost
perfect. But that's when you go out to beat world records."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he didn't realize how special his race was until his coach,
Trevor Graham, ran onto the track after the race and lifted
Montgomery into the air.</TE>
<TE>   The performance earned Montgomery $250,000 from the IAAF--$50,000
for winning the race, $100,000 for the world record and $100,000 for
becoming the men's overall Grand Prix champion.</TE>
<TE>   Jones won $150,000 by winning the women's 100 Saturday in 10.88
and becoming the women's overall Grand Prix champion. But she
preferred to focus on her teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, like everyone else in the world, I am in awe of him," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery finished second to Greene in last year's world
championships in Edmonton, Canada, and immediately began talking
about supplanting him as the world's fastest man. But when Greene
beat him in this year's national championships at Palo Alto,
Montgomery said, "I'm going to stop talking."</TE>
<TE>   He did that, refusing the opportunity to boast even when Greene's
season deteriorated later in the summer after the deaths of two
relatives and a feud with his shoe company, and, when Montgomery
finally reached his goal Saturday he seemed as surprised as anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, world records always happen when you expect them the
least," he said. "I had no objective today. I just wanted to beat
Dwain Chambers."</TE>
<TE>   He did that, thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   "I am traumatized by what Tim did, completely traumatized,"
Chambers said. "But I'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   So, Greene vowed, will he.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I can run faster," he said. "It's going to be a lot of fun
next year."</TE>
<TE>   Greene said he is not disappointed to lose the record.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't hurt at all," he said. "I knew that I wasn't going to
die with the world record."</TE>
<TE>   As for Montgomery, Greene said, "An athlete can have a magical day
and today he had a magical day. Everything clicked for him."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery, whose personal best before Saturday was 9.84, seemed
to always know that it would click some day.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I could beat the world record ever since I ran 9.96 at the
age of 19 when I had no muscles, no training and no technique," he
said. "I didn't know when, but I knew I would eventually do it."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery apparently believes he can run even faster. His North
Carolina license plate reads, "TRACK 9.75."</TE>

<HD>Fun for the Road</HD>
<DH>UCLA: Bruins take Cowboys by storm and improve to 2-0 as
Paus passes for 277 yards and three touchdowns, and defense comes up
with five turnovers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>STILLWATER, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Thunderstorms were forecast. And although not a drop fell from the
sky, the weather report was on target.</LD>
<LD>   Cory Paus was a one-man cloudburst, raining passes for 277 yards
and three touchdowns in UCLA's 38-24 victory Saturday night over
Oklahoma State.</LD>
<LD>   Lightning was provided by a Bruin defense that surrendered large
chunks of yardage but had four interceptions and a fumble recovery.</LD>
<TE>   Thunder came courtesy of the UCLA offensive line, which gave Paus
plenty of time and answered a second-half Cowboy rally by opening
gaping holes for running backs Akil Harris and Manuel White.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned into a great night for football," Bruin Coach Bob
Toledo said. "It wasn't too humid, it wasn't too hot."</TE>
<TE>   And never is heard a discouraging word when UCLA faces a Big 12
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the fifth without a loss for Toledo against the
Big 12 and it came on UCLA's first visit to Oklahoma State. It was
also the ninth consecutive nonconference victory for the No. 23
Bruins (2-0), who are 10-1 in September the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some mistakes and too many penalties, but I'm pleased with
the way our young team responded," Toledo said. "[Oklahoma State] had
energy early but we didn't cave in."</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys (1-2) scored the first 10 points--just as Colorado
State did against UCLA last week--but the Bruins soon quieted the
boisterous orange-clad crowd of 43,020 at Lewis Field.</TE>
<TE>   Paus hit Craig Bragg on a fly pattern for a 41-yard touchdown and
linebacker Spencer Havner returned an interception 23 yards for a
score to put UCLA ahead to stay 10 minutes into the game.</TE>
<TE>   The lead grew to 24-10 by halftime and was never less than 14
points thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Although Paus completed a modest 13 of 27 and had his first pass
intercepted, he spread the ball around to seven receivers. And on
long throws, the Illinois native, playing again in the Central time
zone, was as in-sync as a Swiss watch, completing eight of more than
20 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Cory was putting the ball on the money," receiver Tab Perry said.
"We were making big plays."</TE>
<TE>   Paus, who sported a scruffy seven-day beard because he hasn't
shaved since cutting his chin against Colorado State, seemed more
relieved than elated. He was happiest about not allowing the rough
start to snowball into a poor performance.</TE>
<TE>   "The interception was not a good way to start the game, and the
crowd was so loud it was hard to hear, but I had family here and I'm
glad we played well enough to win," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Early on, it was like having a devil on one shoulder and an angel
on the other. One is saying 'Here we go again' and the other is
saying 'Keep your head up.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he kept his eyes focused downfield, hitting Mike
Seidman for a 27-yard touchdown late in the second quarter and
scrambling before finding Ryan Smith for a 25-yard touchdown and a
31-10 lead early in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Then after Oklahoma State responded with a seven-yard touchdown
catch by Rashaun Woods, Paus directed an 80-yard drive that ate up
the last five minutes of the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   He capped it with a three-yard touchdown run, lumbering into the
corner of the end zone ahead of two defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "When Cory did that I knew he was going well," Perry said. "He was
doing anything it took for us to win."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo is grudging in his praise of his quarterback. But after the
fifth-year senior moved to No. 4 on UCLA's career touchdown list with
35, the coach had kind words.</TE>
<TE>   "He missed a few balls early but got back in the rhythm," Toledo
said. "He does more than people realize. He's a veteran and he
understands what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the cushion, the work of the UCLA offense wasn't done
because Oklahoma State moved the ball consistently in the second half
behind the passing of Josh Fields, who threw for 291 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Woods made seven catches for 143 yards and consistently beat
senior cornerback Ricky Manning Jr., who was called four times for
pass interference. Woods, no slow 'Poke, went over the 100-yard mark
for the fourth consecutive game and has caught at least two passes in
21 games in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver John Lewis also had seven catches--for 113 yards--giving
the Cowboys another threat.</TE>
<TE>   "We made as many big plays as we could," Woods said. "We thought
we could come back and we gave it a good effort. But they kept coming
too."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA countered late in the game by chewing up yardage on the
ground. Harris finished with 83 yards, White had 67 and Bragg added
34 on two reverses.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw holes in their defense and made adjustments at halftime,"
Harris said. "The line did a tremendous job, just playing hard down
the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State wasn't through quite yet, cutting the deficit to
38-24 with 12:53 to play and mounting a drive to the UCLA 39-yard
line with about four minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   That's when lightning struck one more time for the Bruins, with
sophomore Ben Emanuel notching his second interception.</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel, the starting strong safety, moved to free safety in the
second half because Matt Ware sprained his right ankle. Ware had an
end-zone interception in the second quarter that stopped a Cowboy
drive near the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   "We had enough talent to play with these guys, but when you turn
the ball over five times you change the outcome of the game,"
Oklahoma State Coach Les Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin linebackers Brandon Chillar (cramps) and Marcus Reese
(ankle) also sat out most of the second half. Tim Warfield and Dennis
Link filled in admirably, complementing Havner, who had eight
tackles, two pass deflections and a forced fumble in addition to the
interception.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys contributed, just like last week," Seidman said.
"We have to be happy with this victory."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins showered and were on the bus headed to the airport by
the time thundershowers hit. They had beaten the storm, beaten
Oklahoma State, and were setting their sights on another Big 12 foe,
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "We have another game next week against a team that started the
season with high expectations," Emanuel said. "I think we'll just
keep getting better."</TE>

<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson's keys to the game and how the Bruins matched up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Contain the potent Cowboy passing game: The Bruins did not
exactly stop quarterback Josh Fields, who passed for 291 yards, or
receiver Rashaun Woods, who had seven catches and 143 yards. But they
did intercept four passes, returning one for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   2. Improve special teams play: Nate Fikse averaged 45.2 yards on
five punts and put all but two kickoffs into the end zone. Only one
of the punts was returned--for 25 yards in the fourth quarter. UCLA's
Tyler Ebell had two 16-yard punt returns and Tab Perry brought back a
kickoff 34 yards. Chris Griffith made one of two field goals after
missing two tries last week.</TE>
<TE>   3. Establish a running attack: UCLA rushed for 189 yards,
including 141 in the second half when the Bruins were protecting a
lead.</TE>

<HD>Manning Relieved by Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>STILLWATER, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Ricky Manning forced a smile. His team was victorious and he shared
in the elation.</LD>
<LD>   But his much-ballyhooed matchup against Oklahoma State receiver
Rashaun Woods did not go as well. In fact, Manning seemed lost in the
woods during much of UCLA's 38-24 win.</LD>
<LD>   "I had a long night," he said. "I'm happy we won, at least I saved
face."</LD>
<TE>   In the first quarter Woods was used solely as a decoy, but in the
second he had three catches for 86 yards and Manning twice was called
for pass interference. One penalty negated an interception by safety
Matt Ware with 1:19 left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, Woods out-jumped Manning in the end zone on
a fade route for a seven-yard touchdown that cut UCLA's lead to
31-17.</TE>
<TE>   It got no easier for the Bruin senior in the fourth quarter. Woods
made a catch for 39 yards despite Manning again getting called for
pass interference, setting up a touchdown that made the score, 38-24.</TE>
<TE>   And a few minutes later he was flagged again for interference on a
pass that was thrown several yards over Woods' head.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of those [penalties] were not good calls," Manning said.
"But that's the way it goes."</TE>
<TE>   Manning got a measure of retribution with about nine minutes left
and Oklahoma State driving, making two plays that forced a punt. He
tackled John Lewis for a four-yard loss on second down and broke up a
pass intended for Billy Bajema on third down.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, Manning felt out of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   "I was about to die I was so tired," he said. "I had to go to the
sideline and lie down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bob Toledo gave Drew Olson another tough assignment, and it did
not turn out as well as it did last week against Colorado State, when
the freshman quarterback led UCLA on a pivotal 52-yard scoring drive
in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Olson came on early in the second quarter with UCLA ahead, 17-10,
and beginning a possession at its four-yard line. He handed off to
Akil Harris for a three-yard gain then nervously threw two incomplete
passes from the end zone and the Bruins punted.</TE>
<TE>   The second throw was nearly a fumble. The ball slipped from
Olson's hand like a watermelon seed as he threw it and fell near his
feet. An Oklahoma State defender pounced on it in the end zone, but
the official ruled that Olson's arm was moving forward.</TE>
<TE>   "It just slipped out," he said. "It's happened to me before. I let
go too early. I have to fix the problem and move on."</TE>
<TE>   That was all Toledo needed to see. He wasn't going to put Olson
back in unless the game was a blowout.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted him to play again in the second half, but it was too
close," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State guard Corey Curtis drew gasps when he lay
motionless on the field for nearly 10 minutes with 1:28 left in the
first half. He was taken off on a stretcher but was diagnosed with a
stinger and has full movement in his arms and legs.</TE>

<HD>Fun for the Road</HD>
<DH>USC: McCullough helps Trojans get their running game in
gear, Palmer has solid effort and the defense holds Buffaloes to 61
yards and four first downs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The sellout crowd at Folsom Field cheered wildly Saturday when
Ralphie IV, Colorado's 1,300-pound mascot, left her pen for a
traditional pregame ramble across the length of the field and back.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the fans, nor USC players who saw the end of the buffalo's
jaunt as they emerged from the locker room for kickoff, could have
predicted that Ralphie would cover more ground than the Buffaloes'
offense.</LD>
<LD>   USC, ranked 17th, dominated from start to finish en route to a
40-3 victory over No. 18 Colorado before 53,119.</LD>
<TE>   The Trojans (2-0), playing for the first time since defeating
Auburn on Sept. 2, limited the Buffaloes to 61 yards and four first
downs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they credited our defense too much in their game
plan," Trojan linebacker Melvin Simmons said. "I don't think they
thought we could play four quarters of dominating defensive
football."</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes (1-2) also were unprepared for the emergence of a
Trojan rushing attack that produced 181 of the Trojans' 425 yards.</TE>
<TE>   And who could blame them?</TE>
<TE>   USC averaged 87.7 yards a game last season and ran for 84 yards
against Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   But Sultan McCullough showed his breakaway speed against the
Buffaloes, scoring on a career-long 62-yard run and finishing with
110 yards in 15 carries. Malaefou MacKenzie gained 35 yards in 10
carries and freshman Hershel Dennis averaged 6.4 yards for five
carries.</TE>
<TE>   "The offensive line did a great job opening up holes for all of
us," said McCullough, who has rushed for 100 yards or more 10 times.
"I just did my part."</TE>
<TE>   So did quarterback Carson Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   With representatives from 11 NFL teams watching from the press
box, Palmer completed 22 of 30 passes for 244 yards and a touchdown
with no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed five of five passes during the Trojans' first
possession that ended with a 32-yard touchdown pass play to MacKenzie
on fourth and seven with 9:56 left in the first quarter. He was four
for five later in the quarter in an 80-yard drive that began with
tailback Justin Fargas' first carry of the season and ended with
MacKenzie's 14-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman wide receiver Mike Williams caught a game-high seven
passes for 90 yards, junior flanker Keary Colbert and senior wide
receiver Kareem Kelly each caught four passes and tight end Gregg
Guenther had three.</TE>
<TE>   "The job our linemen and running backs did opened up the passing
game," said Palmer, who completed 25 of 30 passes for 275 yards
against Colorado two years ago. "That balance is hard to beat."</TE>
<TE>   USC overcame the altitude, the crowd, several mistakes in its
kicking game and everything attempted by a Colorado team that was
without several injured players, including starting quarterback Craig
Ochs, running back Marcus Houston and punt returner Jeremy Bloom.</TE>
<TE>   Senior quarterback Robert Hodge, playing in place of Ochs,
completed his first pass for 20 yards and missed on his final eight
attempts. Running back Chris Brown, who gained 185 yards last week
against San Diego State, rushed for only 44 in 14 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a good day," Colorado Coach Gary Barnett said. "We
were totally inept."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, USC looked as if it benefited from the bye week that
allowed Coach Pete Carroll and his staff to develop some depth.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Winston Justice started at right tackle and solidified a
line that did not give up a sack. Reserve safety Jason Leach
intercepted a pass and reserve defensive back Forrest Mozart blocked
a punt that freshman safety Mike Ross recovered for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The frequent substitutions kept Trojan players fresh and USC wore
down the Buffaloes with superior team speed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they had much of a chance to get into a rhythm
today," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's only ray of hope came in the second quarter when the
Buffaloes trailed, 14-0. Freshman safety J.J. Billingsley intercepted
a pass by Palmer and returned it to the Colorado 47, where USC was
flagged for a late hit.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's elation lasted only a moment, however, because
officials also cited the Buffaloes for a late hit on Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   The offsetting penalties gave the ball back to USC. Three plays
later, McCullough ran off left tackle and then broke to the sideline.
He outran defensive backs Phil Jackson and Donald Strickland to the
end zone for a 20-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as he got to the crease, everybody on the sideline knew
he was gone," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   After Pat Brougham's 42-yard field goal in the third quarter, USC
again took control with an 80-yard, 14-play drive that consumed 7
minutes 21 seconds and ended with Palmer's one-yard sneak into the
end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Trojans turn their attention to Saturday's game at Kansas
State.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the season, Carroll said the first three games
of the season were a tune-up for the beginning of Pacific 10
Conference play Sept. 28 against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are off to a good start, but they are not about to get
ahead of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be the No. 1 defense in the nation--this is a step,"
linebacker Mike Pollard said. "Talking about our record right now
doesn't make sense because two wins doesn't mean anything. We'll talk
about our record after the season if we're 12-0."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Gary Klein's keys to the game and how the Trojans matched up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Weather the conditions: The altitude at Folsom Field--5,345
feet above sea level--did not affect the Trojans because their
defense was rarely on the field. Colorado went three and out on five
of its first six possessions and managed only four first downs in the
game. USC rotated tailbacks, receivers and defensive linemen, keeping
everyone fresh.</TE>
<TE>   2. Establish a running game: Five tailbacks helped the Trojans run
for 181 yards. Sultan McCullough led the way with 110 yards and
scored on a career-long 62-yard run off the left side. The offensive
line did an outstanding job opening holes. Freshman Winston Justice
started at right tackle and redshirt junior Eric Torres started at
right guard.</TE>
<TE>   3. Reduce penalties: The Trojans, who were flagged eight times for
92 yards against Auburn, were penalized seven times for 50 yards
against Colorado. They got lucky, though, when a personal foul
penalty for a late hit after a Colorado interception was offset by a
penalty against the Buffaloes for roughing the passer. USC kept the
ball and went on to score a touchdown.</TE>

<HD>Fargas' Debut Is a Cameo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN and DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Justin Fargas' long-awaited debut as USC's tailback lasted one play.</LD>
<LD>   That was more than enough for the senior transfer from Michigan,
who had not carried the ball since 2000, when he was playing running
back for the Wolverines in a game against UCLA at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Fargas was not expected to play because of a hamstring strain he
has been nursing since training camp.</LD>
<TE>   But he entered the game with 6:06 left in the first quarter, took
a handoff from quarterback Carson Palmer and ran off right guard for
four yards. He was immediately pulled from the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good just to get on the field against an opposing team,"
Fargas said. "It was great to get in there and get that first carry
out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas got in because he convinced running backs coach Kennedy
Pola that he felt strong. USC Coach Pete Carroll was surprised when
he saw Fargas in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "After warmups, I told the trainers to get his helmet and don't
give it back to him," Carroll said. "Somehow he found it. I just
wanted him to go through warmups and he talked Kennedy into putting
him in."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Fargas would play more against Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to doing more," Fargas said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Kareem Kelly had four receptions for 36 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has caught a pass in all 37 games he has played for the
Trojans. The streak ties John Jackson's school record for consecutive
games with a reception.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC shored up the problems it had with special teams against
Auburn, but new ones emerged against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   David Davis had an extra-point and field-goal attempt blocked and
also missed an extra-point attempt when the ball hit the right
upright.</TE>
<TE>   "I was doing everything possible to fix my mechanics and at least
get that extra point up, but I tried too hard," Davis said. "It's a
good thing the offense and defense brought their A games."</TE>
<TE>   Trojan punter Tom Malone had a kick blocked and the Trojans
botched a punt return when a Colorado player knocked Marcell Allmond
into Kelly as he tried to catch the ball after signaling for a fair
catch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was raining, but Mike Garrett doesn't remember that. He
remembers that Folsom Field had more of a crown in 1963 and that it
didn't have an upper deck full of seats.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly what Garrett remembers about his collegiate debut as a
USC tailback, against Colorado, was that he kept on telling himself:
"Don't make a mistake. Don't make a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   It's tough being a rookie. Garrett was back at Folsom Field on
Saturday in his job as USC athletic director. He said he really had
no idea how many yards he had gained in USC's 14-0 win (58 in 11
carries). All he remembered was that "I was very, very nervous," and
that he got chewed out by Coach John McKay the following Monday
because the Trojans got a penalty when the teams got into a fight
after he ran out of bounds.</TE>

<HD>Two Yankees Scuffle Before Another Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tension that has always existed between Orlando Hernandez and
Jorge Posada--sometimes for the better, sometimes not--exploded
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   El Duque punched Posada in the face before the New York Yankees'
game against the Chicago White Sox, and teammates had to pull the two
men apart, according to Newsday. The incident probably will
strengthen the desire of the Yankees' front office to get rid of
Hernandez after the season.</LD>
<LD>   Posada, who didn't appear injured, started at catcher and went 0
for 4 in the Yankees' 8-1 loss to the White Sox at Yankee Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   After Saturday's game, Hernandez waved at a reporter who
approached him and said, "Bye," as in "Goodbye." He offered no
further comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got nothing to say about that," Posada said. "It's something
we're going to keep in the clubhouse."</TE>
<TE>   A team source said the matter will be handled internally, with no
announcement if there is any disciplinary action.</TE>
<TE>   The one-punch affair took place about 70 minutes before the
scheduled first pitch, in the Yankees' clubhouse. According to a
source with knowledge of the situation, it stemmed from an incident
in Hernandez's last start Wednesday. Hernandez had wanted to discuss
the incident with Posada, to find out if the catcher had failed to
pass on a warning from the umpire about licking his fingers. But
Posada refused to talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   In Saturday's game, Dan Wright (12-12) handcuffed the
highest-scoring team in the majors for seven innings and Jeff Liefer
hit a three-run homer into the upper deck. Roger Clemens (12-6) lost
for only the second time in 21 decisions at Yankee Stadium over the
last two years--and first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Baltimore 4--Derek Lowe won his 20th game and Manny
Ramirez homered twice as the Red Sox won at Boston and guaranteed the
Orioles an unprecedented fifth consecutive losing season.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe (20-7) is the first pitcher in baseball history to win 20
games the season after saving 20. He is also the first to record at
least 40 saves and later win 20; John Smoltz and Dennis Eckersley did
it the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 8, Tampa Bay 4--Former NBA player Mark Hendrickson won his
first major league game, and Carlos Delgado homered twice at Toronto
as the Blue Jays won their season-high sixth consecutive game.
Hendrickson (1-0), a 6-foot-9, 28-year-old left-hander, allowed one
run on four hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 3, Cleveland 2--Rick Reed (15-7) yielded two runs on
four hits in seven innings and the Twins cut their magic number in
the AL Central to two with a victory at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Kansas City 2--Paul Byrd (16-11) pitched a four-hitter
for his AL-leading seventh complete game and Mike Sweeney had two
RBIs as the Royals won at Detroit.</TE>

<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With possibly three starts remaining, left-hander Jarrod Washburn
could become only the sixth 20-game winner in Angel history.</LD>
<LD>   Washburn pitched 7 1/3 strong innings Friday night in a 3-2
victory over the Texas Rangers at Edison Field, improving to a
team-leading 18-5 with a 3.24 earned-run average in 30 starts. Nolan
Ryan twice had 20 or more victories, winning 22 games in 1974.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have not had a 20-game winner since, though three
pitchers have won 19, with Mark Langston the last to reach that mark,
in 1991. Washburn wants to end the streak.</LD>
<TE>   "At the start of the year, I didn't say, 'I want to win 20 games,'
but that's in your mind," he said. "If it happens, it's significant,
no matter if I was on the [New York] Yankees, who've been around
forever, or the [Tampa Bay] Devil Rays, who haven't been around for
many years.... It's a great achievement for any pitcher."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All-Star left fielder Garret Anderson suffered a mild strain of
his right hamstring on an infield hit in the third inning of
Saturday's 8-6 victory over Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, who was two for two with a double, was replaced by Alex
Ochoa in the fifth and is listed as day to day, Manager Mike Scioscia
said. Anderson is batting .314 and leads the club with 26 home runs
and 114 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angel bullpen has allowed only three earned runs in its last
47 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said right-hander Aaron Sele is scheduled to throw off a
mound today for the first time since doctors detected a partially
torn rotator cuff in his pitching shoulder. If all goes well, Sele,
who threw batting practice Friday, would pitch a simulated game
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   With 14 games remaining, it is doubtful Sele could regain enough
stamina and shoulder strength to return as a starter. It's also
unlikely he would be included on the postseason roster for the
division series, though he could be added as a reliever later if the
Angels advanced.</TE>

<HD>Hudson's Shutout Sinks Mariners</HD>
<DH>Baseball: A's keep pace with Angels when Seattle wastes a
strong pitching performance by Moyer with back-to-back errors that
lead to the game's only run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Tim Hudson made a point to congratulate Barry Zito before Saturday's
game for the near no-hitter Zito threw Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Hudson should hear some kind words back after the gem he
pitched Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Oakland right-hander pitched a four-hitter to win his seventh
consecutive decision and the Athletics' pitching staff was almost
perfect for the second consecutive day, defeating the Seattle
Mariners, 1-0.</LD>
<TE>   Hudson (14-9) had to be good to beat soft-throwing left-hander
Jamie Moyer, who did not allow an earned run in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   One day after Zito took a no-hitter into the eighth inning in a
5-0 victory, Hudson pitched his second career shutout and 11th career
complete game. He is 11-3 in his last 22 starts. He struck out two,
compared to Moyer's seven.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland remained tied for first in the AL West with the Angels,
who beat Texas. The two teams lead the Mariners by nine games for the
wild card.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson stayed late Friday at the Coliseum until Zito's no-hitter
was broken up--several innings longer than he'd typically stick
around the night before a start. He wasn't going to miss it if Zito
completed it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lot of fun," Hudson said. "It was a tough act to follow.
We're just going out there and trying to pitch and put up zeros and
give the team a chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   The A's scored an unearned run in the second, when John Olerud and
Carlos Guillen committed successive errors. Scott Hatteberg drove in
Terrence Long with a single to right.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up the single to Hatteberg, Moyer retired 13
consecutive batters before Long singled in the seventh. Moyer (13-8)
pitched a three-hitter in his 25th career complete game.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim threw the ball well and I felt like I threw the ball well,"
Moyer said. "The game turned on a mistake, a key play. I had a
feeling this series would be that way. The A's are playing with a lot
of confidence right now, and rightfully so."</TE>
<TE>   Hudson retired the last 17 batters. Mike Cameron's double in the
second for Seattle was the lone extra-base hit of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a wasted effort by Jamie, because we couldn't do
anything for him," Cameron said.</TE>
<TE>   The A's have recorded a major league-leading 19 shutouts. It
marked the fifth time they have done it in back-to-back days this
season, including the fourth since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not surprising with the staff we have," A's Manager Art Howe
said. "Maybe they'll have a few more before it's all over."</TE>
<TE>   The struggling Mariners, who look nothing like the club that won
an AL-record 116 games last season, have lost six in a row. It's
their longest losing streak since they lost eight in a row Aug.
12-20, 2000. The Mariners were shut out in consecutive games for the
first time since Sept. 21-22, 1992, at Kansas City.</TE>

<HD>First Is Again Home of Braves</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How hard is it to win 11 consecutive division titles?</LD>
<LD>   How hard is it to win one?</LD>
<LD>   Consider the Angels, who are trying to win their first since 1986,
or the Dodgers, who will be happy to reach the playoffs for the first
time since 1996, even if it's as a wild card.</LD>
<TE>   The American and National leagues can offer up an array of other
yardsticks by which to gain a fuller appreciation for what the
Atlanta Braves have accomplished, but the Braves are so taken for
granted, the difficulty in doing what they have done is so
overlooked, that their latest clinching produced one paragraph in the
middle of the baseball roundup in this and other publications.</TE>
<TE>   If that is now the annual response to the Braves' division
domination, if his team's success has become something of an
"afterthought," Atlanta General Manager John Schuerholz said, "it is
no less frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   "If you were to talk to people in the Angel and Dodger
organizations about how fierce they're fighting to win their
divisions, about how gut-wrenching it is to win one time ... well,
it's the most difficult achievement in baseball because you have to
prevail over a full season of 162 games," Schuerholz said. "You might
have good fortune over a five-game series, you might be at the top of
your game and better than your opposition in a seven-game series, but
you need to have every element working to win a division title, and
to do it 11 times is unprecedented and something we're very proud to
have done because we know how difficult it is."</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta streak has spanned an ever-changing landscape--from
beating the Dodgers and San Francisco Giants when the Braves were
part of the NL West to dominating the New York Mets in the East, from
balanced to unbalanced schedules, through free agency, arbitration
and soaring payrolls that force a constant turnover in personnel and
consistent focus on the minor league pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 25 players on the opening-day roster, 10 were new to the
Braves, and yet the story was the same.</TE>
<TE>   A 60-20 sprint through the middle of the season humbled the
division and buried the underachieving Mets, whose off-season
shopping spree had landed Mo Vaughn and Roberto Alomar, among many
others.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Steve Phillips and Bobby Valentine could be out as the Mets'
general manager and manager, victims of a Sept. 9 Atlanta clinching
that was the earliest by any team since the 1995 Cleveland Indians
wrapped up the AL Central on that date.</TE>
<TE>   What were the keys to the 11th in a row? Schuerholz and others
cited the following:</TE>
<TE>   * The transition of John Smoltz, who leads the majors with 50
saves only one year after elbow reconstruction, to the closer role.</TE>
<TE>   * The 17-6 comeback of Kevin Millwood and the continued stability
of Tom Glavine (17-10) and Greg Maddux (13-6), who both hope to
re-sign as free agents but will have to wait until the playoffs
conclude for meaningful negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   * The baseball-best performance of an unlikely middle relief corps
that includes Chris Hammond, who had been retired for two years;
Darren Holmes, coming off back surgery; Kevin Gryboski, a waiver
acquisition, and Tim Spooneybarger, a rookie.</TE>
<TE>   * The acquisition of Gary Sheffield for the middle of the lineup
and the willingness of Chipper Jones to move to left field, putting
Vinny Castilla on third.</TE>
<TE>   "We focused on offense in the off-season because runs have been
scarce for us in the playoffs," Schuerholz said, "but the irony is
that pitching has been key again.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't mean we're disappointed with Sheffield. Just the
opposite. He's been outstanding, on and off the field. His numbers
[24 homers and 78 runs batted in] are down because he hurt his wrist
early, but he's given the lineup a stronger feel and presence,
although I'm not sure it's been any more productive."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason is that Castilla and Javy Lopez have had
disappointing seasons from a power standpoint, and Manager Bobby Cox,
who is long overdue for the manager-of-the-year award, has been
forced to do considerable juggling at first and second base.</TE>
<TE>   Still, here are the Braves with the best record in the NL, waiting
at this point to play either the wild-card Dodgers or Giants in the
opening round of the playoffs, and forced to cope with yawns from the
industry and media.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired of 'em," Philadelphia General Manager Ed Wade said in
backhanded respect. "We started 9-19, have played 11 games over .500
since, and we're still several cab rides away from even being able to
look at them."</TE>
<TE>   What Wade meant is that the Braves are in their own league. While
Florida, Montreal, Philadelphia and New York are virtually tied in
the East, the Braves are 21 games ahead.</TE>
<TE>   If they haven't generated much applause in the process, if they
don't get much respect for their 11 consecutive division titles,
maybe it's because people view them as one of baseball's big spenders
(even though their payroll of $93.5 million ranks only seventh) and
maybe it's because they haven't demonstrated that same domination in
the World Series. They've reached the Fall Classic five times during
the streak but won only once.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that probably has something to do with it," said
Schuerholz, who plans to remain as the Atlanta GM for two more years
at least. "Knowledgeable people in our industry know how difficult it
is to achieve what we have, but even some of those people are caught
up in the societal view of what have you done lately, the view that
if you don't win the last game you've done nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days, when it was strictly a matter of winning your
league and advancing to the World Series, there was respect and
appreciation for the teams that prevailed over the full season.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, you not only have to win your division, but you have to
survive three levels of playoffs. It's so much harder, and I think
it's inappropriate when people dismiss the 11 titles just because
we've won only one World Series in that time."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but the Braves are haunted by the fall failures despite
their summer success.</TE>
<TE>   Although the players had a taste of champagne when they returned
to work on Tuesday, they, too, took the 11th in a row in stride,
resigned to the fact that public perception is unlikely to change
until they win another World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux, for instance, said he spent Monday night watching the NFL
game while checking his computer for updates on the Mets-Phillies
game that would give Atlanta another title.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my wife, 'Hey, we won again,' " Maddux said, "and she
said, 'Shocker.'</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Hey, OK,' and went back to watching the rest of the
football game.' "</TE>

<HD>New Buddy Act: Bonds and Kent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Kent has produced such a big second half for the San Francisco
Giants that he even has Barry Bonds lobbying for his re-signing as a
free agent. Much, of course, has been made of the tenuous
relationship between Bonds and Kent, which erupted in public display
during their dugout scuffle in San Diego earlier this season, but
Bonds went to bat for Kent the other day, telling Bay Area reporters
that "if he's not back next year, I will be one [teed]-off player ...
and I'm not afraid to say it." If Kent isn't back, Bonds said, "the
organization better get somebody that can do as well or better."</LD>
<LD>   It would be no easy task replacing the only second baseman to
produce six consecutive seasons of 100 or more runs batted in and who
was batting .319 with 34 home runs and 104 RBI through Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, at one point it appeared there was no way the Giants
wanted Kent back. Club officials were so angry about the wrist injury
he suffered while doing wheelies on his motorcycle during spring
training, and his subsequent failures to tell them the truth about
how it happened, that they privately suggested he would not be
re-signed.</LD>
<TE>   Kent has probably turned that opinion around, although it is
uncertain how far the Giants will go financially with a middle
infielder making $6 million. Plus, Managing General Partner Peter
Magowan has to make a decision on General Manager Brian Sabean and
Manager Dusty Baker. Both will also be free agents when the season
ends, and in heavy demand.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff has done his job, so they need to put up or shut up," Bonds
said. "Dusty has done his job, Brian has done his job. We have great
players over here, a good GM, a good manager. If you lose that, you
might never get it back."</TE>
<TE>   Kent said he appreciated Bonds' support and tried again to explain
their relationship, saying he finds most of the articles about it to
be "phony."</TE>
<TE>   "There are differences between Barry and I, there's no doubt about
that," he said. "But Barry and I coexist on a professional level that
has made us both better ballplayers, that has made us a better
ballclub, and other than that, there's nothing to write about.</TE>
<TE>   "What Barry and I do is sit back and laugh at the articles, the
rhetoric and color. It's entertaining for the fans, [but] kind of
disrespectful for Barry and I. That's the power of the pen."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he really sat with Bonds and laughed about the
portrayals, Kent said, "yeah, [but] probably not over dinner."</TE>
<TE>   Cy Caliber</TE>
<TE>   Angel left-hander Jarrod Washburn (18-5, 3.24 earned-run average)
has moved into Cy Young Award territory, but Barry Zito, three years
removed from USC and "right on the schedule" he envisioned, has
virtually locked up the award, barring a collapse in his final two or
three starts. The 24-year-old Oakland left-hander is 21-5 with a 2.64
ERA, featuring a knee-buckling curve that keeps getting bigger and
better and, as a veteran American League scout said, has been
"virtually unhittable" in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the A's and Angels juggle rotations, Zito and Washburn will
face each other Wednesday in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Of Zito's award candidacy, Manager Art Howe said, "His numbers
speak for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Lou Through?</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Manager Lou Piniella is now openly critical of club
ownership for suddenly, amid another season of sellouts in Safeco
Field, pulling in the financial reins and preventing General Manager
Pat Gillick from pulling off a midseason trade that might have
provided the hitter Piniella has frequently said was needed.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella's comments have fueled speculation that he will leave
Seattle with a year to go on his contract to manage the Devil Rays in
his Tampa Bay backyard or accept one of several other anticipated
openings. However, Piniella instructed baseball information director
Tim Hevly to call ESPN the other day and ask their commentators to
stop contributing to the speculation and to remind them of his
contract, saying he does not plan to go anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his disappointment with ownership, Piniella's response has
to be accepted as sincere, although a skeptic might say that
Piniella's response was actually aimed at trying to remove a
distraction for his struggling team as it hangs by a thin thread in
the wild-card race that is basically over.</TE>
<TE>   Home Sweet ...</TE>
<TE>   The surprising aspect of the Boston Red Sox's collapse in the AL
wild-card race is that the Red Sox have a league-best 46-28 record on
the road but have been unable to sustain it at Fenway Park, where
they are a modest 38-35. Then again, maybe it's not so surprising
given the Fenway pressure and the fan and media reaction when the
high expectations aren't met.</TE>
<TE>   An 8-3 loss to the bumbling Baltimore Orioles in Boston on Friday
night prompted newest Sox Cliff Floyd to say, "There's no
sugarcoating it, this place is a tough place to play." And still
trying to shake the jeers, Nomar Garciaparra, who might be packed
already in anticipation of his departure after the Red Sox exercise
their 2004 option, said with heavy sarcasm, "It's a good place to
play, right? There's a lot of positive vibes around here, right? It's
great."</TE>

<DH>Capistrano Valley's new football coach rebuilds programs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In bold, black type on a yellow background, block letters shout
"Under Construction." That's the headline over Mission Viejo
Capistrano Valley High's football schedule poster.</LD>
<LD>   It's also the team's slogan, a motto adopted by Coach Randy
Blankenship, who was hired last winter to supervise a reclamation
project.</LD>
<LD>   The Capistrano Valley Cougars, winners of only eight games in the
last three seasons, are Blankenship's fourth team in five years.
Prominent coaches usually don't skip around so much, but Blankenship
has spent most of his 19-year career turning down-and-out programs
into winners. Two have won section titles.</LD>
<TE>   Capistrano Valley provides the same challenge as a few of
Blankenship's previous endeavors. The Cougars didn't have a losing
record their first 21 seasons. Then came 1997, when they went 2-6-2
and missed the playoffs for only the second time in school history.
Five years later, Capistrano Valley still hasn't returned to the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Hence the construction--or reconstruction--theme. Playing off the
motto, about two dozen students wore hard hats to Friday night's
opener, and the Cougars showed some progress during a 26-15 loss to
Aliso Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   The wing-T offense employed by Blankenship, popular in an era
before his players were born, left the Cougars running into each
other during most of the first half. But by the fourth quarter they
seemed to be getting the hang of it, moving in sequence, churning out
yards, and putting together a late scoring drive.</TE>
<TE>   "I had 16 starters who stepped on a varsity field for the first
time," Blankenship said. "They're going to have to grow up fast."</TE>
<TE>   With their new coach, they probably will. Blankenship, 49, took
his first head coaching position in 1984 at Grass Valley Nevada
Union, a school nestled in a former gold mining town between
Sacramento and Lake Tahoe. That season, he led the team to its first
playoff appearance since 1907.</TE>
<TE>   After guiding Nevada Union into the playoffs five of the next six
years, he left in 1991 for Clovis West, near Fresno, where he
jump-started that program and led the Golden Eagles to four Central
Section championships in eight years. He left Clovis West after the
1998 season for Fallbrook in San Diego County, where he inherited a
team that had six consecutive losing seasons. Two years later, he was
leading the Warriors past Carlsbad in the San Diego Section Division
I championship game at Qualcomm Park.</TE>
<TE>   It was then Blankenship took a bold career step, making a move he
hoped would lead to a college coaching position. He took his family
to Granbury, Texas, a scenic Civil War town of 7,000 about 30 miles
south of Forth Worth. Granbury's football team had gone 1-9 the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The season was all that Blankenship imagined: huge crowds and
beautiful stadiums with television monitors mounted above the snack
bar. His team showed some life too, finishing 4-6.</TE>
<TE>   But days after the much-improved season, Blankenship was forced to
defend himself against allegations from a small group of parents who
claimed he had been emotionally and verbally abusive to the players.</TE>
<TE>   "He jumped into the Bible Belt and started doin' things we don't
do out here," said Susan Merritt, whose son, Taylor, played middle
linebacker for Granbury last season.</TE>
<TE>   Blankenship said the confrontation arose when he didn't nominate
their sons for the all-district team. The coach had his supporters,
but when the athletic director and some members of the school board
started questioning him, Blankenship started looking for a new
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   His resume, which included CIF coach of the year honors at Clovis
West in 1998, looked good to Capistrano Valley officials.</TE>
<TE>   "He certainly has the credentials to build and develop a program,"
said Tom White, the school's former athletic director who was
chairman of the search committee that recommended Blankenship. "And,
like all coaches, he has the ability to have a huge influence on the
athletic program, the school and the community."</TE>
<TE>   But Blankenship didn't feel welcome by everyone at Capistrano
Valley. Some objected to rumors he was being paid an exorbitant
salary, while others voiced concerns that another physical education
teacher would be laid off to make room for him.</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, Blankenship signed a two-year contract worth
$70,000 a year to coach Granbury and had to take a pay cut of more
than $10,000 when he accepted the Capistrano Valley job. Blankenship
thinks speculation might have been spurred by his family's
participation in the television show, "Meet the Folks," in which his
21-year-old daughter, Senta, was courted by three blind dates who
spent a weekend at the family's Dana Point home.</TE>
<TE>   The show was aired in July, and re-broadcast last weekend,
featuring footage of what appeared to be a very luxurious pool home
with an ocean view. The home is wonderful, Blankenship confirmed. And
leased.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way with my salary I could even afford a home out
here," he said. In Texas, the Blankenships bought a lakeside home,
but they couldn't pull enough money out of it after only one year, so
they now rent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a gamble," Blankenship said. Then again, he has
rolled the dice before and almost always has come out a winner.</TE>

<HD>Ishii Is Not Scared Off</HD>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers believe the mental hurdles pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii will
face in his return from a fractured skull next season will be more
difficult to overcome than the physical ones.</LD>
<LD>   So they plan to make a counselor available to help Ishii cope with
the possible anxiety of returning to the mound after being hit in the
head by a line drive off the bat of Houston's Brian Hunter in Dodger
Stadium last Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii's response: Thanks, but no thanks.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people say there might be fear factors when I come
back," Ishii said through an interpreter by phone from his home
Saturday. "But that's not the case. If it was, I would quit."</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say Ishii had no fear last week, especially during
his ambulance ride to the hospital Sunday and when he underwent two
hours of nasal cavity surgery early Monday morning to have a titanium
plate inserted in his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, being a human being, living is an important thing, and
you have to do what you can to help your family," said Ishii, who
expects to return to the team after being examined Tuesday but is out
for the rest of this season. "Those kinds of thoughts became more
important after this accident."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii still hasn't seen a replay of the incident; nor does he want
to. In something of a fortunate twist, his wife, Ayako, did not
witness the play, even though she was at Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "She was not [in her seat]," Ishii said. "She was changing diapers
at that point."</TE>
<TE>   A line drive to the head can alter a pitcher's career. In 1975, a
liner off the bat of Tony Muser hit then-Boston pitcher Dick Pole in
the right eye, breaking his jaw and shattering his retina.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, after a promising start with the Red Sox, Pole
was out of the big leagues with a 25-37 record, and 27 years later,
he has only 10% vision in the eye. "I was never the same [after the
accident]," said Pole, now Montreal's pitching coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger reserves Luke Allen and Joe Thurston each had their first
major league hit Saturday. Chin-Feng Chen had his first big league
plate appearance, becoming the first Taiwanese-born player to appear
in a major league game.</TE>

<HD>Spunky Gal Tries Dirt Surface</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Spunky Gal hasn't raced in the afternoon on the main track since
March 2001, when she made the second appearance of her career, but
trainer Vladimir Cerin believes the time is right to return to a dirt
surface in today's E.B. Johnston Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   She was claimed for $50,000 by David and Holly Wilson after a
victorious debut over two years ago. The owners had to show a lot of
patience with the daughter of Runaway Groom; she didn't race again
for about eight months. She has made good use of her time since,
however, earning about $100,000 while making her last nine starts
over the turf, including a wire-to-wire victory on turf at Del Mar
two weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   It's often a smooth transition from grass to Fairplex because
grass runners are usually very nimble around the tight turns. Even
though Spunky Gal, being ridden by Scott Stevens, is being asked to
give a minimum of eight pounds to her seven rivals this weekend, she
deserves marquee treatment. Look for her to settle behind Happy
Michelle and Demidoll, and then set sail going to the last of those
three bends.</LD>
<TE>   Spunky Gal has captured a respectable three of 10 starts, but
she's a long way from the long-term numbers turned in by Johnston
foes Revillew Slew and Lookn Mighty Fine, who have recorded 12 and 11
victories, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Revillew Slew was second in her only try over this course, and
Lookn Mighty Fine has a place and show in her two local attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Davis 2. Kg Jim Dandy 3. Oh To Win 4. Roberta's
Mango 5. Silky Goose 6. Oh Jazzy Day 7. Wiley Grey 8. Gold Scammer 9.

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Of the big fights at the Mandalay Bay Events Center since it opened
for boxing in 1999--Tapia vs. Ayala, De La Hoya vs. Trinidad, Barrera
vs. Morales, Trinidad vs. Vargas, Rahman vs. Lewis--promoter Bob Arum
considered this one the most successful at the box office.</LD>
<LD>   Tickets for a previous sellout, De La Hoya vs. Trinidad in 1999,
never went on sale to the general public because several casinos, not
just Mandalay Bay, bought all of them as incentives for high-rolling
gamblers.</LD>
<LD>   There was a public sale for this fight; all 11,425 tickets were
sold. Ringside seats went for $1,200. There weren't as many
celebrities in attendance as for some big fights, but Jack Nicholson
and Eddie Murphy were reported to be at ringside.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Until Felix Trinidad comes out of retirement, which might be
never, Puerto Ricans are searching for the next champion from an
island that has produced many.</TE>
<TE>   They believe they might have found him in Miguel Cotto, 21, a
super-lightweight from Caguas.</TE>
<TE>   He faced the biggest test in his 12 professional fights in the
last of five preliminary fights, and, when the 10 rounds were
finished, he had beaten the veteran John Brown, 34, of Akron, Ohio,
in a unanimous decision.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's best nights are behind him, but he was a valuable opponent
for Cotto because of the experience Brown earned in the ring against
fighters such as Shane Mosley, Gabriel Ruelas and Angel Manfredy.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is 23-10.</TE>

<HD>Florida St. Reaffirms Its Status</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLLEGE PARK, Md.</DL>
<LD>Florida State used a remarkable 30 minutes of football to regain its
stature as the team to beat in the Atlantic Coast Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Rix threw two touchdowns and ran for another as the
fifth-ranked Seminoles took a 30-point halftime lead and rolled past
Maryland, 37-10, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   After having their nine-year run as ACC champions halted by
Maryland last season, the Seminoles (3-0, 2-0) re-established their
superiority in authoritative fashion.</LD>
<TE>   Turning three turnovers into touchdowns, Florida State went up,
30-0, at halftime and improved to 13-0 against Maryland (1-2, 0-1).
Since joining the ACC in 1992, the Seminoles have won 11 in a row
over the Terrapins by an average score of 50-15.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike last year, when the Seminoles fell behind, 14-0, and needed
a late surge to beat the Terrapins, this one was decided when FSU
scored 24 points in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Rix followed a Terrapin fumble with a 19-yard touchdown pass to
Anquan Boldin to make it 13-0. The quarterback also scored from the
one after a Florida State interception, and 31 seconds later Rix
passed to Talman Gardner for a 56-yard touchdown pass after another
Maryland fumble.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland finally got a field goal in the third quarter, but by
that time the crowd of 51,758 had thinned.</TE>
<TE>   Rix completed 13 of 25 passes for 227 yards, leaving after
absorbing a hard hit in the fourth quarter. Greg Jones rushed for 106
yards and a touchdown, and Gardner had four catches for 109 yards.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Trainer saddles two winners in Kentucky Cup
three days after placing top four in Del Mar Futurity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Bob Baffert's 2-year-old steamroller stormed into Kentucky on
Saturday and flattened a round of foes.</LD>
<LD>   Baffert, who not only won Wednesday's Del Mar Futurity with
Icecoldbeeratreds but also finished second, third and fourth in the
race, saddled undefeated Vindication for a six-length win in the
$100,000 Kentucky Cup Juvenile. Earlier on the card at Turfway Park,
Baffert's filly, Atlantic Ocean, won the $100,000 Kentucky Cup
Juvenile Fillies by 2 1/2 lengths. A heavy favorite, Vindication paid
$4.20, but Atlantic Ocean's win was a mild upset. She paid $9.80
while the 11-10 favorite, Ruby's Reception, finished second.</LD>
<LD>   Baffert, who has won eight Triple Crown races--three Kentucky
Derbies, four Preaknesses and one Belmont Stakes--since 1997, will go
for a three-state hat trick today when he sends out Truckle Feature
in the $200,000 Belmont Futurity.</LD>
<TE>   Vindication had to contend with a riderless horse at Turfway when
longshot Crowned King dumped his rider leaving the gate and still
completed the course.</TE>
<TE>   Vindication, bought at auction for $2.15 million by Satish Sanan's
Padua Stables, ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:46 3/5. Private Gold finished
second and Tito's Beau was third.</TE>
<TE>   Vindication's first two wins came in sprints at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to give him some adversity by exposing him to two
turns," Baffert said. "I lost track of him when they went down the
backstretch, but when he got to the quarter pole I picked him up and
knew he was all right."</TE>
<TE>   With Vindication, Icecoldbeeratreds and others, Baffert figures to
be loaded for the $1-million Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Arlington Park
on Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Smith, who finished eighth in the jockey standings at Del
Mar, will be picking his spots until the Oak Tree season at Santa
Anita starts Oct. 2, and Smith couldn't have been in a better spot
Saturday. After riding Atlantic Ocean and Vindication to victory,
Smith picked up his third stakes win aboard Pure Prize, who won the
Kentucky Cup Classic, at $400,000 the richest race on the card.</TE>
<TE>   Favored Dollar Bill rallied but was a length short of Pure Prize
at the wire. Hero's Tribute was third. Pure Prize, paying $16.80,
races for the Dinny Phipps family and trainer Shug McGaughey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pat Day rode the other two Kentucky Cup winners, clicking with
Trip in the $200,000 Turfway Breeders' Cup and Day Trader in the
$150,000 Sprint.... At Belmont Park, Mandy's Gold, at 8-1, sat off
the speed and beat You by 2 1/4 lengths in the $300,000 Ruffian
Handicap; Carson Hollow won the $100,000 Floral Park Handicap; Boston
Common captured the $150,000 Jerome Handicap; and Startac, winless
for 13 months, ended a seven-race streak by winning the $200,000
Belmont Breeders' Cup Handicap. In the Ruffian, favored Raging Fever
was off the board for the first time in almost two years.... At
Arlington Park, Little Treasure, trained by Laura de Seroux, won the
$150,000 Pucker Up.... At Fairplex Park, the $10,000 winner-take-all
mule match race went to Black Ruby by a half-length over Taz. There
was more than $71,000 bet in the win pool, with Black Ruby paying
$2.60 for $2.... Sigfreto won for the first time in seven starts by
taking the Phil D. Shepherd Stakes.</TE>

<LD>Senior driver Brooks Cook scored two of his three goals in a
five-goal fourth quarter and North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake
defeated Long Beach Millikan, 12-1, in the championship game of the
Jim Toring Memorial water polo tournament Saturday afternoon at
Belmont Plaza in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Harvard-Westlake (5-0), ranked No. 4 in The Times' preseason
rankings, has won the tournament three times in the four years the
event has been played since Toring, a former Harvard-Westlake and
UCLA standout, died after being struck by a bus while traveling with
the U.S. national team in France in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Harvard-Westlake and unranked Millikan were locked in a scoreless
tie through the first quarter, but the Wolverines took a 4-0 halftime
lead. Sophomore goalie Jay Connolly made 12 saves for
Harvard-Westlake.</LD>
<TE>   In the third-place game, Zach Beckmann had three goals and two
assists to lead South Pasadena (3-1) to a 17-7 victory over Rolling
Hills Estates Peninsula (2-2).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sonya Reynolds of Quartz Hill defeated Alisha Herrera of Valencia,
10-2, in the singles final match, and Granada Hills scored 17 points
to win the team title of the Valencia girls' tennis tournament for
the fourth consecutive year. Granada Hills' Tracey Takeshita and
Alexandra Margolin took the doubles title, defeating teammates Randi
Levine and Lessica Linder, 10-3, in the finals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshmen Brenda Cohen and Courtney Granger paced the Canyon
Country Canyon girls' cross-country team to a meet-record victory in
the Seaside Invitational meet Friday at San Buenaventura State Beach
in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen and Granger finished first and second, respectively, in the
freshman girls' race with times of 17 minutes 48 seconds and 17:51
over a flat, three-mile course run on bike paths.</TE>
<TE>   Their times bettered the previous freshman meet record of 18:01
set by Palmdale Highland's Rachel Guerrero in 1996. They also helped
Canyon to a cumulative team time--the total of its top five runners'
times from the four races--of 90:21. That broke the previous record
of 91:36 set by Yucaipa in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steven Chang of Santa Monica was released from Community Memorial
Hospital in Ventura on Friday night after suffering a broken nose in
the Seaside meet. Chan, a senior who was running his first race since
moving from Michigan this summer, was accidentally tripped just after
the start of the race and landed on his face. X-rays revealed a
broken nose, and he received several stitches.</TE>

<LD>All-American Futurity winner AB What A Runner arrived at Los Alamitos
last week but isn't expected to race until late November when the Los
Alamitos Million trials take place.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Dennis and Kris Hill and trained by Bret Vickery, AB What
A Runner won the $1,896,250 All-American Futurity Sept. 2 at Ruidoso
Downs in New Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Morning Snow, owned by Charlie and Dixie Patterson, won the Los
Alamitos Kindergarten Futurity and Ed Burke Memorial races earlier
this year, which probably makes her the early Million favorite.
Morning Snow will win a bonus of $1 million if she wins the Los
Alamitos Million, which is expected to have a purse of well over $1
million. The bonus is a reward for winning the Kindergarten, Ed Burke
and Million races in one season.</LD>

4. Cal Flaming Gala. 5. Lucky Red Hot. 6. Farahon. 7. No Mas Delor.
8. Pure Flattery. 9. Strawflying Six.</TE>
<TE>   Late four: Take Farahon, Tennaco and Nike Dash in the sixth; No
Mas Delor, who drops in class for this race, and first-time local
starter Scatter Dust in the seventh; Pure Flattery in the eighth and
in the final race go with Strawflying Six and Bonzai Barry. Total
cost: $12.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: In the second, Australia-bred Lithium returns

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds reached 100 RBIs in a season for the 11th time in his
career, tying the NL record set by Hank Aaron, and the Giants
defeated the San Diego Padres, 12-4, Saturday night at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds hit a pair of run-scoring singles and Pedro Feliz matched
his career high with three RBIs as the Giants remained one game ahead
of the Dodgers in the NL wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first scheduled Saturday night game played at Pacific
Bell Park in the stadium's three-year history.</LD>
<TE>   Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx and Lou Gehrig hold the major league record
of 13 seasons with 100 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' first-inning single marked the 13th consecutive time he had
reached base, two short of the NL mark he shares with John Olerud.
The streak ended when he grounded out in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   Livan Hernandez (11-15) allowed four runs and 10 hits with five
strikeouts and three walks in 5 2/3 innings to win his second
straight start.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 5, Milwaukee 0--Randy Johnson earned his career-high 22nd
victory, pitching a three-hitter and striking out 17 to lead the
Diamondbacks at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (22-5) and Curt Schilling (23-5) are the first National
League teammates to each win at least 22 games since 1965--when Sandy
Koufax and Don Drysdale did it for the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The victory reduced Arizona's magic number for clinching the NL
West title to nine with 14 games left.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson walked two and matched his season high in strikeouts
during his 15th double-digit strikeout game in 33 starts this season.
Johnson has struck out at least 10 batters 186 times in his career,
29 short of Nolan Ryan's major league record.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 2, Houston 1--Woody Williams showed no ill effects from
a strained muscle in his left side, pitching seven scoreless innings
for his third consecutive victory for the Cardinals at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals won for the 10th time in 11 games to extend their
lead to seven games over the Astros.</TE>
<TE>   Williams (9-4), making his fourth start since coming off the
disabled list Aug. 29, held the Astros to five hits.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 10, Florida 5--Tom Glavine, who had lost a career-high
four consecutive starts, hung on with help from the bullpen in the
Braves' victory at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine (17-10) pitched five-plus innings for his first win in his
last six starts. Given a 5-0 lead, he was chased in the sixth when
the Marlins scored four runs.</TE>
<TE>   Javy Lopez hit a three-run homer and Gary Sheffield hit his 25th
homer for the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Pittsburgh 1--Fill-in Eric Junge pitched five
impressive innings for his first major league win in the Phillies'
victory at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Burrell hit his 37th homer and Bobby Abreu had a two-run
single as Philadelphia beat Pittsburgh for the first time in five
tries this season.</TE>
<TE>   Junge (1-0) made an emergency start after Brandon Duckworth was
unable to pitch because of stiffness in his back.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, New York 4--Michael Barrett and Endy Chavez hit
two-run doubles in the sixth inning as the Expos overcame Mike
Piazza's two homers to beat the Mets at Montreal. Piazza reached 30
home runs for the eighth straight season.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Cincinnati 6--Fred McGriff got his 1,500th career RBI
with a two-run homer, and Moises Alou hit a three-run shot to lead
the Cubs at Cincinnati. McGriff, who has driven in 101 runs this
season, became the 40th player with 1,500 RBIs.</TE>

<HD>French Police, FBI to Meet in Dele Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>French police and FBI investigators have scheduled a private
conference today in Tahiti to discuss emerging evidence and witness
testimony while they prepare for Monday's formal search aboard the
boat of missing former NBA player Bison Dele.</LD>
<LD>   A French police official said nine FBI investigators are in Tahiti
for the Dele case. He said a public prosecutor in Tahiti is expected
to declare an open murder investigation by Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Dele, his girlfriend, Serena Karlan, and boat captain Bertrand
Saldo have been missing in the South Pacific since early July.</LD>
<TE>   Miles Dabord, Dele's older brother who is the subject of an FBI
manhunt in Mexico, sailed with the three missing persons from New
Zealand to the French Polynesian islands of Tahiti and Moorea in
early July, when the three were last seen by witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The French police official said his office has gathered "plenty"
of information to forward suspicions that Dabord was involved in the
disappearances.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord, 35, also known as Kevin Eugene Williams, is already the
subject of an arrest warrant in Phoenix for identity theft and
forgery after he attempted to sign one of his brother's checks and
purchase $152,000 in gold Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has learned Dabord left a voice mail message for his
mother, Patricia Phillips, Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Several witnesses on the docks of the Tahitian town Taravao have
reported seeing a man they have identified as the 6-foot-8, 270-pound
Dabord stepping alone off the boat before registering it. The police
official said paperwork has been obtained to note the boat was docked
in Taravao on July 15, not July 8 as previously believed. The
official said the man believed to be Dabord signed the registration
slip with an alias that was not either of his two names or that of
Dele or his former name, Brian Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Among the estimated 20 witnesses who have been gathered in Tahiti
and Moorea are two Tahitian residents who say they drove Dabord 60
miles from Taravao so he could board an airplane departing Papeete,
Tahiti, on July 20, the police official said.</TE>
<TE>   "It made no sense that he would show up in Taravao, when witness
statements and everything done previously on that trip indicated the
group were acting as tourists headed to Honolulu," the police
official said. "They had shopped in Papeete, then found nice [hotel]
accommodations in Moorea. Taravao is not a tourist spot."</TE>
<TE>   The police official said no bloodstains, damage or other signs of
foul play are detectable by visually inspecting the boat from the
dock. He said it is doubtful there are any bodies aboard the boat,
adding, "My personal opinion is that the bodies are in the sea. The
waters off our coast are very deep--planes have crashed and remain
missing--so if the bodies have been [dumped] it will be impossible to
find them."</TE>

<HD>Norton Passes Hart's Test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget about arm strength, intelligence and mobility. Anyone who
hopes to continue the succession of renowned quarterbacks at Newhall
Hart High must pass a toughness test.</LD>
<LD>   Kyle Matter's came when he was sacked 11 times against Westlake
Village Westlake. He never complained. Matt Moore's was against
Wilmington Banning, when he was battered four times on late hits. He
kept limping back to the huddle.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, just about every Hart quarterback has faced--and
conquered--such challenges.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday night, 16-year-old Sean Norton faced the toughest test
any Hart quarterback has encountered in a debut. He was asked to
perform under the intense scrutiny of live television against Los
Alamitos, the second-ranked team in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, the Griffins tried to rattle Norton with a series
of blitzes and disguised pass coverages that would have made lesser
quarterbacks crumble. Time and again, they launched free safety Randy
Estes into the backfield. Sometimes Estes tackled him, other times he
hit him just after the ball was released.</TE>
<TE>   Eight times Norton was tackled for losses, but he never stopped
competing. "He's pretty tough because I don't know anybody else who
gets up after I hit him," Estes said.</TE>
<TE>   So there was Norton, a 5-foot-11 junior, going back to pass with
his team down seven points as the clock ticked down to zero. He threw
the ball as far as he could, hoping for a Doug Flutie-like, Hail Mary
ending. Receiver Cody Kase made it happen, catching the ball after
two tips and running into the end zone to complete a 68-yard
reception. With the extra point, Hart had a 21-21 tie.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like a win," Norton said. "We were expected to lose. To
play like this was unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Look at Norton's final passing totals: 17 completions in 28
attempts, 245 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers alone provide evidence that he's on his way to
joining the list of Hart quarterbacks who have earned All-Southern
Section honors for 17 consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   But don't base everything on statistics. To play quarterback for
Hart requires heart, fearlessness and trust in the team's system.
Norton fits the mold perfectly after playing last season on junior
varsity.</TE>
<TE>   "He jumped into fire, and there was some heavy duty heat," Coach
Mike Herrington said. "He could have been gun-shy with as much
pressure and as many hits as he took."</TE>
<TE>   Norton didn't hide his emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "I was definitely nervous, very nervous," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the club.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, Matter made his college debut as a freshman for
Stanford before 41,000 fans at Boston College. It was a breeze
compared to the pressure and expectations of replacing the
record-setting Kyle Boller, a senior at Cal, in his first start as
Hart quarterback in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "You really don't know what's going to happen and how you're going
to react," Matter said. "It was tough sleeping the night before."</TE>
<TE>   The advantage Norton and other Hart quarterbacks have is
preparation from an extensive summer passing season that's almost a
boot camp for quarterbacks. They play in more than 50 seven-on-seven
passing competitions and are put through almost every conceivable
game situation.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't one thing that can scare me or surprise me," Norton
said. "Hart's offense is so complicated you can't afford to miss out
on anything. Every time you step on the field, you're taught
something new. It is overwhelming at times, but if you stay level
headed and focus on your goals, you'll prosper."</TE>
<TE>   Until the frantic final minute, the Hart-Los Alamitos game
featured outstanding defense. Inside linebacker Brian Elledge of Hart
was so effective tackling Griffin ballcarriers that he might earn a
college scholarship off his dominating one-game performance. Estes
showed repeatedly that he's the best free safety in Southern
California with his speed and aggressiveness.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, Norton's resiliency and toughness made the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   He was admittedly shaken at halftime with his team trailing, 10-0.</TE>
<TE>   "The first half was rough," he said. "I wasn't able to make reads,
but coach said, 'Calm down.' "</TE>
<TE>   Norton let his instincts and athletic ability take over in the
second half. He completed a short pass to running back Paxton Howard,
who ran 46 yards to set up a third-quarter touchdown. He contributed
a 13-yard scramble to pick up a critical first down in the fourth
quarter. He had a seven-yard touchdown pass to sophomore Ryan Wolfe.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half, he stepped up absolutely phenomenally," said
Davis Delmatoff, Hart's offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Barry Sher, Los Alamitos' defensive coordinator, stood
in the middle of Veterans Stadium in Long Beach trying to make sense
of the game's final play.</TE>
<TE>   "We had all our best players back there," he said. "I still don't
know what happened. I'm in shock."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Norton was being mobbed by fans, trying to explain the
wonder of playing quarterback for Hart.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something about it," he said.</TE>

<HD>L.A.'s New Roman Catholic Cathedral--A Place of Faith</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One line stands out in your feature "Mother Church of a Secular
City?" by Larry B. Stammer, Aug. 25: "The challenge will be, is it
going to be a cathedral of power or a cathedral of the people?"</LD>
<LD>   The power of the church--not merely a cathedral--is the people.
The church, we tend to forget, is built not of inanimate stones or
bricks, but of living stones and bricks--the people! And the mortar
that holds those bricks together is not cement but unified faith.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the church has to learn one important lesson from all that
is going on--to rely less on the public relations and marketing
mavens and more on the Holy Spirit.</LD>
<TE>   Jerome Wilson Lloyd</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When I read about the prices regarding the 1,300 crypts and 5,000
niches that lay beneath the cathedral that are up for sale, I was
sickened to be a Catholic and embarrassed to be from L.A. once again.
This isn't the "Hollywood Walk of Fame." This is the very foundation
of what religion and church are supposed to be about. The cathedral
should be a place for people to congregate together under one roof in
prayer; it should not be for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Brittan Brown</TE>
<TE>   Valley Village</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps if Cardinal Roger Mahony hadn't been so preoccupied with
more important matters like the financing and marketing program for
the cathedral and the $50,000 crypts under it, he might have been
aware of the kid-glove treatment given priestly child molesters in
his archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Charles F. Queenan</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The article states: "There is the risk that the cathedral with its
enclosed plaza will come off as a sacred precinct." Well, that's
exactly what a cathedral is in the Roman Catholic tradition, "a
sacred precinct," not a secular building for only the wealthy, or a
building dedicated to tourists, businessmen and greedy politicians!</TE>

lost "its place deep in America's restless heart." She found a city
awash in "the human driftwood of the dot-com implosion."</LD>
<LD>   Wait a minute.</LD>
<TE>   Like most cities in America, Seattle is pinched by the recession.
We see the signs in shrunken payrolls, diminished tax revenue and
humbled dot-comers.</TE>
<TE>   We took a hit but we're still standing. None of the recent events
alter Seattle's enduring economic advantages: its spectacular natural
scenery, strong research university, or feisty entrepreneurial
community. The hustle, brains and creativity that continue to lead
the nation in computer software, commercial aviation, online
retailing, wireless telephones, specialty retailing, and coffee are
now at work in emerging industries such as bio-and nanotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   We're doing things today to ensure prosperity tomorrow. We're
building a new regional light rail system and preparing for a public
vote for a city monorail. We're opening a new football stadium, new
libraries and new community centers. New city policies will nurture
the University of Washington, support our world-class airport and
seaport, expand our cruise-ship tourism, assist small business and
promote opportunity for all. We won't take a single job for granted.</TE>
<TE>   One more thing, baseball fans: Seattle has the best team in
America.</TE>
<TE>   See you in Seattle at the World Series.</TE>

<LD>In her review of Aug. 25 ("Simply Irrepressible"), S. Irene Virbila
refers to "two bartenders wield[ing] cocktail shakers like marimbas."
I think she must have been thinking of maracas, not marimbas. A
marimba is a wooden-keyed, xylophone-like instrument; it would take a
Hercules to shake one over his head. Maracas are gourd-shaped
instruments shaken to make the characteristic rattle-like sound.</LD>

<DH>Mexican Horchata Is Refreshingly Simple to Make at Home</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL BARBER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lunch came early during those Central Valley summers. We started work
at 7:30 a.m., moving sprinklers and whacking weeds at my high school
campus. We broke for a midday meal at 11, knowing that by 3 p.m. it
would be 105 degrees and time to scurry into the shade like desert
insects.</LD>
<LD>   Cold drinks were at a premium. I usually packed a can of root beer
or Dr Pepper, a forgivable crime for a 14-year-old. But I soon
discovered that what I really wanted was an iced glass of the white,
milky beverage one of my co-workers brought daily in a tall jar.
''Rice Kool-Aid,'' he called it, and that seemed about right when I
sampled it. What he had was horchata, that classic Mexican drink made
of rice, milk, water and cinnamon. Imagine my glee when I began to
notice the concoction in Los Angeles take-out restaurants, stationed
next to the lemonade or jamaica (made from steeped hibiscus petals)
and gushing profusely, like a perpetual high-caloric geyser in one of
those weird soft-drink fountains.</LD>
<TE>   The word horchata seems to be etymologically linked to the French
orgeat (originally a barley beverage, now a syrup derived from
almonds and orange flower water) and the Italian orzata (meaning
almond). Horchata is an ancient elixir, introduced to Spain by the
Moors during their 8th-century conquest. But the Mediterranean
version, still exalted in the Valencia region, is not ours. It's made
from chufa (also known as tiger nut), the tuberous root of a certain
sedge. If you want to try horchata de chufa, richer and a little
nutty, you can purchase an imported liter from La Espanola Meats in
Harbor City.</TE>
<TE>   In makeup, Mexican horchata is much closer to rice caudle, an old
American quaff described in the 1860 book "Practical Housewife." For
practical housewives and househusbands of the new millennium, Mexican
horchata is a great addition to parties. During the warmer months, I
find myself constantly foisting margaritas and rum punch on my
guests. Not everybody desires a cocktail, of course (nonalcoholic
margarita mix gives my 7-year-old a headache), so it's nice to have a
buzz-free alternative. Horchata is hard to beat for efficiency and
consistent satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   In searching for a recipe, I wound up in ''Frida's Fiestas,'' a
cookbook co-written by legal professor Guadalupe Rivera--Frida
Kahlo's stepdaughter and daughter of Diego Rivera and his first wife,
Lupe Marin. In the grand tradition of the bohemian upper crust, the
Rivera stepfamilies remained close, even living under a single roof
at one point. Their meals, as described by Guadalupe, were stylized
epics.</TE>
<TE>   Kahlo, who is about to bear a striking resemblance to Salma Hayek,
called September ''the patriotic month.'' In celebrating Independence
Day, she demonstrated her national fervor by mixing three drinks to
symbolize the Mexican flag: red jamaica, green lime water and white
rice water, a.k.a. horchata.</TE>
<TE>   Some recipes include condensed milk or almond flour or vanilla.
Frida's is pleasingly basic. And heck, if it was good enough for Leon
Trotsky and David Alfaro Siqueiros, it's good enough for me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Horchata</TE>
<TE>   Serves 8 to 10</TE>
<TE>   3 cups rice</TE>
<TE>   3 cups milk (dairy or soy)</TE>
<TE>   3 cinnamon sticks, broken into pieces and lightly toasted in a
skillet</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   6 cups water</TE>
<TE>   Cover rice (by at least an inch) in water and soak for 3 hours.
Drain rice and puree in blender with milk and cinnamon. Strain
mixture, discarding rice paste and reserving liquid. In separate
bowl, dissolve sugar in water. Combine rice liquid and sugared water,
stir well and serve over ice.</TE>

<HD>Demon of the '30s Air Racer</HD>
<DH>The Golden Age of Aviation Is Still Aflame in Riverside</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS McKELVEY CLEAVER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took a few decades for wing nuts to catch up with Bill Turner,
champion of the 1930s racing machine.</LD>
<LD>   Turner has been flying on the cutting edge since 1932, when he was
a teen and the aviation world was agog over the "Gee Bee," a
monstrously fast light racer built by the Granville brothers (that
would be Zantford, Thomas, Robert, Mark and Edward) of Springfield,
Mass. During the golden age of air racing in the late 1920s through
the 1930s, the sport generated excitement in America and Europe on a
par with NASCAR or World Cup events today. At the nadir of the Great
Depression, hundreds of thousands watched Jimmy Doolittle set a speed
record with the Gee Bee at the National Air Races in Cleveland. At
nearly 300 mph, the slight-framed racer was faster than the best
military plane anywhere. In the crowd that day was 14-year-old
Turner, son of a pioneer Navy pilot. "I got to see all the races. My
father was determined to have the Navy take what was being learned
and create the fighters we'd need in the future."</LD>
<TE>   Turner flew in the Navy himself and remained an active pilot.
After building his first plane in 1966 (a "Fly Baby" whose top speed
was a mere 70 mph), Turner headed back to an era when light planes
went a tad faster. His first 1930s replica, of "Miss Los Angeles,"
the Brown B-2 racer that placed second in the 1934 Thompson Trophy
race, rolled out in 1971. Turner was out front on a trend: By 1998,
nearly two dozen replica racers appeared at the Experimental Aircraft
Assn.'s annual convention in Oshkosh, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1970s, Turner retired as dean of students at
Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, moved to Riverside and
opened Repeat Aircraft, a replica and restoration company at Flabob
Airport in the Riverside County town of Rubidoux. Turner's rendition
of the Gee Bee Model Z appeared in the 1991 movie "The Rocketeer"; he
has also reproduced the American-made Miles &amp; Atwood Special and the
British twin-engine de Havilland "Comet," winner of the 1934
London-Melbourne Race. His most recent endeavor is a Laird-Turner
"Special," which took the Thompson Trophy in 1938 and 1939. Turner
has also restored originals such as Benny Howard's 1930 "Pete."</TE>
<TE>   The reproductions are so accurate that they're as dangerous as the
originals, which got their preternatural speed from a scary inverse
ratio between hefty engine and small frame. Original Gee Bees killed
several pilots; Jimmy Doolittle compared flying one to balancing a
pencil on your fingertip. Turner nearly became a Gee Bee fatality
himself in 1978, when brake failure during a landing whomped Turner
and the airplane upside down into a ditch.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the 84-year-old is flight-testing his new Laird and
planning his next project. "I'm going to build the French Caudron
racer that won the Thompson in 1936. They say it was a real handful."</TE>

<DH>Television Host and Producer Huell Howser Finds His Dream
House in Twentynine Palms</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA THORNBURG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Huell Howser is passionate about California. The television host and
producer of the PBS program "California's Gold" has made his
reputation as an everyman searching for amazing stories of everyday
California life, from iconic Clifton's Cafeteria--one of his favorite
downtown eateries--to little-known neighborhoods such as historic
Angelino Heights. "Our stories set out to reveal the richness of life
in California, including its history, people, culture and natural
wonders," Howser says.</LD>
<LD>   A Tennessee transplant who arrived in Los Angeles in 1981 to work
as a reporter for KCBS-TV, Howser first visited Twentynine Palms a
decade ago while exploring for features for his program. "I was
covering the relocation of the Old School House--the first public
building in Morongo Valley--by the local historical society, and we
all had lunch afterward at the Twentynine Palms Inn," Howser says. "
I fell in love with the desert and the straight-talking people who
live there."</LD>
<TE>   When a 1953 ranch-style home he had admired became available, he
bought it the next day. The house, which had belonged to the Dunn
family for nearly five decades, had one of the few pools in town and,
Howser says, was a gathering place for the community. ''Nearly
everyone in the area had been out swimming or to dinner, including
me,'' he says. ''I think houses take on the feeling of their owners,
and this one had good vibes.''</TE>
<TE>   Howser made a promise to the family to keep up the home and its
entertaining tradition. The house was in excellent condition and
needed only minor work. ''Mostly I pared away some layers,'' Howser
says. He called architect Hagy Belzberg in Santa Monica to help with
the renovation and add on a new bedroom suite. They began with a few
cosmetic changes, such as removing the Mexican pavers in the foyer,
the kitchen linoleum and the wall-to-wall carpeting, and updated the
concrete floor by resurfacing it for a more polished appearance. In
the living room, they freshened walls with white paint, added new
doors and windows and took down all heavy drapery. ''I don't have a
single window covering,'' Howser says. ''I want to enjoy my desert
views.''</TE>
<TE>   They next turned their attention to opening up a long storage shed
adjacent to the house. ''It was probably a former carport that they
enclosed,'' Howser says. Belzberg converted the shed into an
indoor-outdoor living space, keeping the roof and supports for the
structure but gutting everything else. He added a perforated steel
wall in the south-facing room that acts as a sun-screening device
while allowing breezes to pass through and keep the room cool even on
hot desert days. ''The wall is also transparent,'' Belzberg says.
''It acts like a veil so anyone driving into the courtyard gets hints
and peeks at what's beyond . . . a sort of teaser for the house.''</TE>
<TE>   A Richard Serra exhibition at the Geffen Contemporary inspired the
exterior wall. Howser, who has a fascination for raw industrial
objects, found the 8-by-20-foot steel plates--which weigh in at a ton
and a half apiece--at a steel plant in Ontario. Belzberg then
designed the dramatic wall of tilted, saw-toothed plates that
gradually emerges from the desert to encircle the desert compound.
''It took five guys six weeks with a crane to install them. It ended
up costing as much as the house,'' Howser says.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the compound, Howser decorated the outdoor room with
mid-century furnishings he purchased from secondhand and consignment
stores in Palm Springs. ''I don't know the names of any of the
pieces,'' Howser says. ''I buy furniture based on how comfortable it
is. Besides, I have a PBS pocketbook, not a CBS one.'' Furnishings in
sherbet colors--tangerine, citrus, pistachio--mix with industrial
pieces that Howser collects and transforms into functional objects. A
doughnut-shaped aluminum air duct serves as a coffee table; copper
sheets salvaged from a scrap metal yard are organic-shaped light
fixtures. Several 100-year-old grinding wheels from Gladding, McBean
pottery, a tile factory Howser once featured on his show, provide
additional seating when he hosts large groups. "I make my living
finding stories that other people pass by. But everyone and
everything has a story to tell," he says. "Raw industrial objects
have an innate beauty for me. I sometimes wish they could talk."</TE>
<TE>   Sandwiched between the living room and pool, a fire pit with a
seating ledge offers warmth on cold desert nights. On summer
evenings, the party often moves out to the pool, which Howser and
Belzberg extended by 12 feet, creating a shallow shelf six inches
deep for dining alfresco. ''I put the dining table and chairs in the
water and eat with my feet in the water,'' Howser says. Later, he
might carry out a mattress and sleep under the stars. ''I never get
tired of looking up at the desert sky. This is what California living
is all about .''</TE>

wall of individual steel plates, used for the assembly of ship hulls,
to enclose Huell Howser's desert home, right. The wall goes from five
feet to eight feet tall as it gradually emerges from the desert
landscape. ''The best thing about the wall is that from the road you
can't see into the compound so I have complete privacy, but because
the house is built on a slight hill, I have an unobstructed view out
to the mountains and desert,'' says Howser. His collection of
consignment store furnishings decorates the living room, which has a
polished concrete floor and pitched cedar strip ceiling. ''The whole
idea out here in the desert is how practical and comfortable the
furniture is. I don't want anything dainty I can't put my feet on.''</CP>

expensive to be a wonderful piece.''</CP>

<HD>Home is Where the Heart Aches</HD>
<DH>She Thought She Had Left Behind the Hurt of Being
Different. Then She Returned to the Town of Her Childhood and Found
That Some Things Hadn't Changed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOMINIQUE DIBBELL</AU>
<BD>Dominique Dibbell is a Los Angeles-based freelance
writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I graduated from high school and lit out for the East Coast, sure
that I would never return to the Inland Empire. Twenty years later I
am back in my mother's house in my sleepy hometown on the easternmost
edge of L.A. County. I am overwhelmed by a creepy feeling that
although so much time has passed, not a thing has changed. And yet
this is not my life, I swear! I am a semi-famous lesbian theater
artist from New York City! But the whole package--career,
sophistication, accomplishments--seems to have vanished without a
trace, evaporated in the dry Southern California air.</LD>
<LD>   I have come home because my mother is gravely sick. When I first
arrive, she has one foot in the next world, and I am thrust into the
role of primary caretaker. I brush up on all the death literature and
try to prepare. But my mother defies the odds and gets better. I am
happy for that, yet now I find myself in a limbo world: She is
recovering, but is still too ill to be left alone.</LD>
<TE>   My girlfriend looks at me with doleful eyes: When can we move out
and begin our new lives in glittery Los Angeles? I cannot answer her
unspoken plea. I am locked in a paralysis born of duty and the lull
of my hometown's charms--the crazy-pink bougainvillea; the drive-in
on Mission Boulevard that abuts the strawberry field; the backyard
San Gabriels; even the smell of manure on the hot Chino winds. I'm
never cold and I don't have to pay rent.</TE>
<TE>   But we chafe at the provincialism and strain under the weight of
our nursing duties. If I can't bring myself to move, let's at least
get out of the house. We sift through the local paper. "My Fair Lady"
is playing at the local college. I become flushed with nostalgia.
When I was a teenager I went to movies twice a week presented by the
college film societies. I saw "Knife in the Water," "Nights of
Cabiria," "Holiday" and "High Noon," and had my little world cracked
open. I convince my girlfriend that the screening will be ecstasy,
and off we go.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the drafty lecture hall, I am confronted with the
sweetening effect of memory: The seats are like pews, the movie print
is scratchy, and Audrey Hepburn sounds as if she has a bad cold. But
the event is not without its charms. Old folks are here, as well as
moms and dads with their teenage kids. Coffee is sold for cheap out
of plug-in urns, and pink and white animal cookies (my favorites!)
are offered for free. The trapped feeling is lifting.</TE>
<TE>   After the movie we feel too good to go home. I know that it's
after 9. I don't care! I'm feeling wild! We drive to a restaurant in
La Verne--a rockin' establishment that's open till 2 on weekends. The
sign out front says "a family restaurant." I ponder it. What do they
mean by "family"? Is that like "family values," a code we have come
to understand as meaning, among other things, "no queers"? For a
second, the sign strikes me as a kind of sexual orientation version
of "whites only." I chuckle at my gallows humor and amble on in,
humming Lerner and Loewe.</TE>
<TE>   The place is nearly empty--just a cop and couple who looked to be
refugees from a 12-step group. We are greeted by a sulking young
waitress who appears to be 16. Without exactly looking at us, she
grabs two menus and seats us in the booth next to the cop. She
mumbles something. I make out the word "drink." "Yes, I'll have a
decaf, please." I am not bothered by her attitude. I have compassion
for her, even admiration. She has obviously spent a great deal of
time on her hairdo. Her healthy-looking dark brown locks are held
snug by a velvety black scrunchie. Her long bangs burst from her
forehead in a perky explosion courtesy of curling iron and gel.</TE>
<TE>   I feel a subtle wave of awe. I could never achieve that just-so
look so many of our young women master and innovate. I was a tomboy,
and though my family accepted me, others, especially girls like her,
made my life hell. Tonight, sitting in this old haunt, I feel
grateful for the years that have passed. I know who I am today; my
confidence is hard won. I can gaze upon this girl with detachment.
After all, she may want to cut off that pretty hair someday.</TE>
<TE>   She scrawls our drink orders on her pad and looks at us for the
first time. Her eyes widen and she looks back and forth, from my
lover to me, me to my lover. Her features freeze in an expression of
terror mixed with disgust and alarm. It is the look--the one I have
seen a million times. Somehow it takes me by surprise. I am aware
that we stand out a little here, but I think we look pretty good. My
hair is even longish after years of buzz cuts. My girlfriend is tall
and strapping, but she wears her hair in a chic, gamine style, and
small gold hoops hang from her lobes. Nonetheless, the waitress
cannot at once discern our gender, and that has disturbed her
greatly. She flees, and I sigh, disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, well. I am soon enough distracted by the bright photographs of
pork chops and sundaes in my 10-pound menu. I am debating between the
BLT or pudding when I hear her from across the room. She is at the
beverage station talking to her colleague. Her voice, once a surly
mumble, has become stentorian. The other diners raise their heads as
she bellows, with the implied ew!-- "It's a girl. They're both
girls."</TE>
<TE>   I am stunned. I expected her to talk about us, but so loud? I look
over at them. Her blond colleague is peering at us from behind the
counter, straining to get a better look at the he-shes. I feel dizzy
but I know what to do. I catch Blondie's eye and give her a well-done
glare with a side of ironic smile. When civilized people realize they
are staring rudely, they feel embarrassed and stop. But Blondie is
impervious. She keeps on looking and, suddenly, I feel like an animal
in her Naugahyde and wood-paneled zoo.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you hear that?" I ask my girlfriend. She hasn't. Over the
years she's learned to tune it out. "She called us 'its,' " I say.
I'm smiling. I don't know why. I'm not happy. I'm trembling with
anger and burning with--what is this curious, familiar feeling? Ah,
yes, shame. I'm trying to laugh it off. It's not my problem these
girls are ignorant and don't know that male and female come in more
than two flavors.</TE>
<TE>   But I can't help feeling 13 again, scrambling to throw together
some girly camouflage--flared jeans and a cowl neck sweater--so that
I can pass through the gantlet of junior high without getting
creamed. I despised those clothes; they made me feel like a shaved
Samson. And all because girls like Brunette would open their stupid
mouths and scream at me, "It!"</TE>
<TE>   My girlfriend closes her menu and sighs. "Let's leave," she says
wearily. At the thought of this, anger takes a back seat to shame and
I feel panic rise in my gorge. Leave? You mean, get up and walk out?
If we leave, we are saying we deserve to be treated better. But
didn't we bring this on ourselves by not wearing our hair high
enough? My girlfriend rises from her seat, as stone-faced as Gary
Cooper, and I follow her, helpless and nearly blubbering--more like
Don Knotts.</TE>
<TE>   Despite my fear, I stop at the beverage station on the way out. I
don't know what I'm going to say but I am compelled by an invisible
force. Brunette stops the noisy scooping of ice and looks at me from
behind the little partition. Her eyes are big and her lips are pursed
together--she's afraid of me. Good.</TE>
<TE>   "We're leaving," I tell her. "And you might want to think about
lowering your voice the next time you're speculating about people."
And with that we head out the door. Those heat-of-the-moment speeches
never come out the way I want them to. Before we even get to the car
I am wondering if they know what "speculating" means.</TE>
<TE>   We drive east along Foothill Boulevard. It's exhilarating to have
walked out. But after a time the adrenaline wanes and we feel sad.
The insistent question, the one I thought I had put to bed at last,
awakens and screams louder than ever: What the hell am I doing here?
Oh, little hometown, circumstances drew me back to you, and I tried
to make the best of it. I, your native daughter, did try to cozy up
to you, and you, my motherland, did cut me with your long, pretty
fingernails.</TE>
<TE>   Deeper than the anger, deeper than the shame, lies the sorrow. And
deeper than the sorrow is the hunger, for we still haven't eaten.
"Maybe we should just go home and have some cereal," I say glumly.
"No," my girlfriend says firmly. We must get back on the horse. We
must demand our booth at the coffee shop that is America! Carrows, a
nearly identical "family restaurant," comes into view. We look at
each other. I nod tersely. We pull into the parking lot. We take a
breath, then walk in. The moon-faced hostess is more mature; maybe
she's seen a little bit of this big, beautiful world. She smiles
right at us. "'Good evening, ladies." I nearly fall into her arms
with relief.</TE>
<TE>   Months later my girlfriend and I finally move to Los Angeles and
begin to piece together a life. I no longer smart when I think about
that night at the restaurant. In fact, I am grateful for it. I had
been coasting along complacently, a professional lesbian and lauded
for it, and the waitress reminded me that in most parts of the
country that doesn't fly. She had reintroduced me to an awkward young
woman I thought I had left behind 20 years ago. Turns out she was
still there, lingering and moping, waiting for a hug. I scooped her
up and took her with me to the city, where waitresses think twice
before calling me sir. And for the most part, the city suits me.
Except on those mornings when the wind blows from the east and I
think I smell a whiff of manure, and my heart aches for home.</TE>

<HD>POIGNANT PROTEST</HD>
<DH>Seven Decades Ago, the U.S. Government Offered Women Whose
Sons and Husbands Died in World War I Trips Abroad to Visit Their
Graves. A Tiny Band of Poor Black Women Refused Because the Hoover
Administration Insisted That They Travel Separately.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times staff writer Richard A. Serrano, who is based in
Washington, D.C., last wrote for the magazine about U.S. domestic
morale during World War II.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the spring of 1930, a generation before the civil rights movement
challenged the conscience of white America, a small group of mostly
old, poor and uneducated black women staged a protest. They are not
remembered today; their names do not grace civil rights memorials,
they are not revered as pioneers of the movement. Yet their sacrifice
was unmistakable.</LD>
<LD>   Their sons and husbands had been killed in World War I and were
buried in Europe, black soldiers alongside white, in new cemeteries
honoring those who died before the Great War ended in 1918. A decade
later, as memories of the war faded, the U.S. government offered to
send the mothers and widows overseas, all expenses paid, to visit the
graves.</LD>
<LD>   With one caveat. The trips would be segregated, with white women
given higher classes of transportation and lodging, an arrangement
sadly not that unusual in the America of that era. Most black women
went, many of them grudgingly overlooking the racial unfairness. But
23 refused. They wouldn't tolerate such conditions to visit the
resting place of sons and husbands who had made the same sacrifice as
whites. Those 17 mothers and six widows, most of whom rarely traveled
far from their hometowns, passed up the trip of a lifetime.</LD>
<TE>   White House internal memos show that President Herbert Hoover and
his fellow Republicans were well aware of the risks involved in
insisting upon segregating the travelers. The party of Lincoln had
enjoyed blanket support from blacks for scores of years after the
Civil War, but that support eroded under successive Republican
administrations in the 1920s. Fearful of the fallout if the European
trips erupted in controversy, the Hoover administration considered a
number of ruses to shift the blame. Hoover himself favored announcing
that the white women refused to travel with the blacks.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work. The issue did boil up, despite the party's efforts
to contain it. Two years later, black voters, smarting from that and
other grievances, would swing to the Democratic Party for the first
time, helping to elect President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.</TE>
<TE>   The several hundred black women who did travel to the cemeteries
went aboard cargo ships, stayed at the YWCA or second-class hotels,
and were fed fried chicken and watermelon to make them "feel at
home.'' While many harbored resentment that white women sailed on
luxury liners and stayed at five-star hotels, they still felt
compelled to visit the graves.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who refused was Doshia Stevens of Youngstown, Ohio.
Her husband, infantry Pvt. John Stevens, had died in a French
hospital. She desperately wanted to see his grave, and initially
agreed to go. But in July 1930, she wrote a one-sentence letter to
Washington D.C. "Dear Sir, I am sorry to say but I am canceling my
reservation because of discrimination.''</TE>
<TE>   Martin Luther King Jr. was still an infant. The protest by Stevens
and the others seems tame compared to the civil rights demonstrations
he would help lead three decades later, when protesters were beaten,
set upon by dogs and even murdered. Yet the action by these women did
plant a seed, giving others the confidence to challenge racism.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I do not care to go,'' the widow Gladys M. Mayo of New York
wrote in her letter to Washington. "It is not what I thought it would
be. I do not know what segregation is.''</TE>
<TE>   When Quentin Roosevelt was shot down over German lines during the
war, his grieving parents, former president and first lady Theodore
and Edith Roosevelt, asked that their youngest son be buried at the
spot where his plane crashed in occupied France. "We feel that where
the tree falls, there let it lie,'' the former president said.</TE>
<TE>   World War I was the first time that American soldiers were killed
in great numbers overseas, and by the 1920s, the government allowed
their survivors three choices: a burial at the site, such as the
Roosevelts had done, having the bodies of their loved returned to the
States, or having them collected in one of several new commemorative
cemeteries being designed in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Some 78,000 members of the American Expeditionary Force lost their
lives in the war, and a majority of their families had their bodies
brought home. Only 128 left them where they died. The remainder,
about 30,000, were gathered from the battlefields of the Marne and
the Argonne and reburied in six cemeteries in France, one in England
and one in Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   In 1928, a new organization called the Gold Star Mothers began
pressing for government-sponsored trips to the European cemeteries.
As women whose hearts were broken by war, they emerged as a powerful
political lobby. "I have received hundreds of letters from all over
the country from these poor mothers, begging for that opportunity,''
one of their leaders, Mathilda Burling, implored the War Department.
"It must be a pilgrimage Holy and Honorable, only fitting to 100%
American ideals. There are no patriotic ideals in the whole world
greater than American ideals.''</TE>
<TE>   The following year, as Hoover moved into the White House, Congress
approved the provisions for the "Pilgrimage of Mothers and Widows to
the Cemeteries in Europe.'' The new War Department set to work lining
up hotels, cruise ships and other accommodations. Washington
determined that 17,389 women were entitled to go. By the time the
various trips were concluded over the next several years, 6,693 had
toured the European cemeteries.</TE>
<TE>   Of those eligible to go, 624 were black. In segregated America,
the "colored question'' immediately raised its head. How to
accommodate both white and black women?</TE>
<TE>   Most of the black soldiers and sailors had worked as support
staff. They were not felled by enemy bullets; rather, most had been
cut down by pneumonia and other ailments. White America believed the
black man was unfit to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Army Gen. Robert Lee Bullard, one of the war's most
distinguished American officers, a white man from Alabama, publicly
criticized a black division under his command that he said twice had
turned tail in the face of the enemy. "They are really inferior
soldiers,'' the general complained.</TE>
<TE>   Hoover and his Republicans saw no reason to disturb the status
quo. Segregation was still the way of American life; the times in
which they lived called for two distinct and separate classes. It was
worth the risk to snub the black voters who had supported the GOP for
so long. But to alienate the vast white electorate, at a time when
the party was trying to woo Southerners and conservatives, could
spell political ruin.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Crow would sail to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, the administration insisted that both races would
be treated in a "like'' manner. But then they announced that black
women venturing to New York to set sail for Europe would stay at the
YWCA in Harlem or other hotels in that black community, while whites
would be put up at the Hotel Astor and other fancy hotels. White
women would be assigned to cruise ships, while blacks would be on
commercial steamers.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1930, four months before the first white ship set
sail, Maurice Spencer, president of the National Equal Rights League
and Race Congress in Washington, wrote to George Akerson, secretary
to the president, decrying the planned segregation. "'It
inferentially reduces Americans of color,'' he warned.</TE>
<TE>   A letter sent to Washington by a black man, signed simply an
"ex-soldier,'' said that "we as a race have enough grief cast upon
our weary shoulders'' and asked, "why is it you wish to cast a
greater shadow of sorrow and insult upon us by segregation of our
beloved Gold Star mothers?''</TE>
<TE>   Much of the planning was supervised by Maj. Gen. J.L. DeWitt, the
quartermaster general. (A decade later he would spearhead the
internment of Japanese Americans in camps in California during World
War II.) The government's typical response was one sent to a black
veterans group in Muskogee, Okla. "It is essential that the groups be
organized in such a way as will permit the women to become acquainted
and form friendships which will help them to bear the trip to the
graves of their sons and husbands,'' wrote Capt. A.D. Hughes, a
subordinate to Gen. DeWitt. ". . . .This was the controlling reason
for deciding to organize separate groups of colored women.'' War
Department officials presented Hoover with a list of troubling
issues. "Who in the group will give consent to mix in with whites, or
vice versa?. . .The steamship company will probably decline to take
them, or at least segregate the colored . . . . White hotels will not
take the colored mothers and widows . . . .''</TE>
<TE>   On April 29, according to DeWitt's diary, the president was
searching for a way out of the dilemma, and he came up with a plan to
lay the blame on the white women. "The president's thoughts are that
invitations could be sent out to the . . . white women . . . offering
them the choice of two ships, one of which would be the vessel that
was to carry the colored mothers,'' DeWitt wrote. "His feeling being
that the white women would all select the boat other than that one
which the colored women would be sent, thereby themselves making the
decision rather than leaving it up to the Secretary of War.'' DeWitt,
however, had concerns that "it would probably create greater
political reaction against that method than from the way we are
handling it. I believe that intelligent white women who received such
an invitation would feel . . . it more or less an insult. And the
reaction would be worse politically than the present reaction was.''
The idea died.</TE>
<TE>   As an alternative, DeWitt noted that blame could be placed at the
hotels and cruise lines, which refused to take blacks. Their policies
were "in strict accordance with the law'' of that time; they could
not be forced to integrate. He then offered a ruse of his own: make
sure the first entourage of black women is treated well, then get
them to encourage any black protesters to drop their objections.</TE>
<TE>   On May 14, the War Department finalized its decision for separate
trips. On May 26, the prostests began. The NAACP presented Hoover
with petitions bearing 56 signatures from around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "As a Gold Star Mother who happens to be colored I wish to protest
against the gratuitous insult . . . .'' the petitions began. They
concluded: "If you as president of the United States refuse to
abolish this ruling, we respectfully decline to make the trip to
France, preferring instead to remain at home and retain our honor and
self-respect.'' James Weldon Johnson, a preeminent black poet, wrote
one of his most famous works about the horror for white America if it
turned out that the remains of the unknown soldier at Arlington
Cemetery was a black man. The poem, he said, was "written while
meditating upon heaven and hell and democracy and war and America and
the negro Gold Star Mothers.'' The New York Amsterdam News, one of
the country's largest black publications, carried its own poem, "In
Flanders Fields.'' It mourned that dead black soldiers now "can never
sleep--ingratitude has made it so.'' At the White House, hundreds of
postcards from blacks and whites poured in, protesting the separate
voyages. Other voices were heard too. W.E.B. DuBois warned that black
voters were being tempted to switch to the Democrats. "Black hands
buried the putrid bodies of white American soldiers in France,''
wrote DuBois, declining to hide his anger. And yet "black mothers
cannot go with white mothers to look at their graves.''</TE>
<TE>   The president's inner circle fretted. In a confidential memo, F.
Trubee Davison, acting secretary of war, suggested backing up the
administration's idea of blaming others. "Under the circumstances we
could state that the railroads and steamship lines themselves were
compelling the segregation,'' he wrote. Several of the major cruise
lines were balking at taking on a mix of black and white passengers,
fearful they would lose business. The Cunard Line, the Anchor Line,
and the North German Lloyd company advised the War Department that
they suddenly were too booked to make any extra excursions with
mixed-race passengers.</TE>
<TE>   So the administration announced that commercial steamers, or
"cargo ships'' as they were derided, would ferry the black women. To
carry the segregation even further, they assigned Col. Benjamin
Davis, the highest-ranking black officer in the Army, to accompany
them as their host.</TE>
<TE>   On Memorial Day weekend, Walter White, acting secretary of the
NAACP, held a press conference in New York just as the first ship of
white women was clearing the harbor there. The next day, he staged
another press conference at the capital in Washington. He said the
association had written all 624 black women entitled to go to Europe,
and had received protest petitions with signatures from 56. The press
conferences drew little ink in the white papers.</TE>
<TE>   The War Department released its own press rebuttal, saying the
women were being segregated out of the "most careful consideration of
the interests of the pilgrims themselves. No discrimination whatever
will be made as between the various groups. Each group will receive
equal accommodations, care and consideration.'' The government
clearly felt it had the upper hand. In a memo to DeWitt, his
assistant, Col. W.R. Gibson, noted smugly: "It is a known fact that
these colored women are below the average in intelligence and it is
my opinion that many of them have signed this letter without
intending to decline the invitation to make the pilgrimage.'' About
the second part, sadly, he was right.</TE>
<TE>   The first steamer to carry black women left New York in July of
1930, 58 mothers and widows aboard the American Merchant. DeWitt had
written to Col. Richard T. Ellis, his subordinate handling
arrangements in France, to say that it was important to treat the
black mothers "with the utmost care and circumspection while in
Europe. Be certain that no complaint can be made that we did not show
the colored mothers and widows the same deferential treatment that
has been shown all the other groups. I know you will do this. But in
view of the very delicate situation here [in Washington], I felt that
I must bring the subject to your personal attention.''</TE>
<TE>   Ellis replied from Paris that ''we have some inkling of the
agitation which has been going on in the United States.'' He noted
that because of the potential for "political and other troubles'' for
the Republican Party, he would do everything he could to make sure
the black mothers enjoyed their visits. "In fact,'' he told DeWitt,
"we are prepared to bend backward in our efforts to do even more for
them than the white pilgrims, if such a thing is possible.'' The War
Department staged an elaborate going-away ceremony at City Hall and
escorted the ladies to the water's edge. Much to the government's
delight, the white press described the gratitude of the black women.
The Washington Post, for instance, said Mrs. Mamie Sills of Omaha and
Mrs. Annie Bowie of Los Angeles were gushing as they prepared to
sail. "Was the color line drawed (sic) when they put us all on one
boat?'' said Mrs. Sills. "The color line was drawed when God made the
world. I thank the Lord for enabling me to get this far on the
trip.'' "Amen!'' replied Mrs. Bowie.</TE>
<TE>   In Paris, the women were equally effusive. "Ever since I lost my
son in 1918, I have been wanting to come,'' one woman was quoted
saying. "I would have come over in a cattle boat. I would have swam
over if possible. I love my race as strongly as any other, but when I
heard that the United States was going to send us over I could not
refuse.'' The Paris papers carried stories and pictures. The theaters
ran newsreels, both silent and talking, of the curiosity--to the
French--of seeing such a large, segregated group of black women
touring French soil, following in the steps of their white
counterparts, weeping at the American cemeteries and laying a wreath
at the Arc de Triomphe.</TE>
<TE>   American papers picked up similar stories. When the women arrived
in France, they were met by a black band and asked to sing spirituals
such as "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.'' They were treated to "racy''
shows in the Paris nightclubs, such as a performance by Josephine
Baker, a risque black American singer whom the tour sponsors assumed
the women would enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   Then, "on Aug. 1 comes the biggest event of all, when they will
sit down to a real fried chicken dinner, with all the fixings,''
announced the Chicago Tribune's Paris edition. ''For the occasion, a
whole car loaded with pasteques, better known to Americans as
watermelon, has been ordered from Algeria.'' Army Maj. B.F. Cheatham
accompanied the mothers back to America, and was "the only white
passenger on the ship,'' he noted in his report. The women, Cheatham
said, were so grateful for everything, ''including the separate trip
for them, and were most appreciative of the work done by the War
Department.'' Surely the president and his fellow Republicans had
silenced the protest.</TE>
<TE>   As the trips continued, the government kept sending invitations to
the protesters. Eventually, all but 23 of them made the journey.
Among those who did not was Mrs. Emma Houston of Philadelphia, who
lost her son, Leopold, a private in a provost company. She was
immensely proud, she said, that he "gave his life in defence (sic) of
American democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Answering the draft on the verge of his graduation at Union
College,'' she added in a letter to the War Department, ''actually
enlisting on July 1, 1918, and rushed through preliminary preparation
for overseas service, he fell a victim of the 'flu' Oct. 18, 1918,
and his body is buried at Brest, France.</TE>
<TE>   "Surely our great president, himself a father and a patriot, who
is the supreme head of the army, together with enlightened public
opinion, will not suffer this order of the War Department to stand."
For the 33 others who initially protested, continuing to say no
proved terribly difficult. They broke down and went to Europe, and
fell neatly into the Hoover administration's public relations ploy.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Henrietta Haynes of Lyons, Ga., the mother of Pvt. Will
Banks, received a letter in October 1930 from Mrs. Willie Rush of
Atlanta, who had gone with the first contingent of black mothers.
Mrs. Haynes was so impressed by Mrs. Rush's account that she wrote
back to her saying that "if it is God's will, I am going to take the
trip next year.'' She soon found herself kneeling at her son's grave.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Rosana Hampton of St. Matthews, S.C., the mother of infantry
Pvt. Lucius Hampton, another victim of pneumonia, also gave in. Once
home, she sent her own letters praising the program. "I am all ways
(sic) talk (sic) and telling my friends about it. I am willing to get
on the stand at any time and give a talk because they are so true and
kind.'' Still others, like Mrs. Clifford Jones of Waynesboro, Ga.,
fretted over what to do. Her husband, Lewis, a private in an Army
engineering company, had died of bronchial pneumonia, and she missed
him dearly.</TE>
<TE>   In one of her first letters to Washington, she said she "would
rather stay at home'' than take a segregated trip. "I can mourn the
loss of him believing that he died for a noble cause and people.
Should I go over segregated, I would be forced to feel that those of
our Negro race who died are not appreciated as much as our white
brothers.'' In a subsequent letter, her resolve seemed to soften. "We
surely cannot feel as welcome to the invitation as do those who have
first choice in this great trip,'' she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Then she wrote government officials that if they could allow her
the dignity of traveling with a white woman, "I would be too happy to
join the entire body of American widows and mothers to see the burial
place of our sons and husbands.'' The government never budged. Mrs.
Jones gave in, and she sailed on one of the last voyages, a ship for
black women only.</TE>
<TE>   Some white women defended the segregation. An American Legion post
auxiliary in Savannah, Ga., for instance, telegrammed the White House
"to thank the president for his action . . . in spite of the attitude
taken by the negro Gold Star Mothers.''</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Fletcher, a history professor at Ohio University, has
researched the politics of the pilgrimages and found it was
instrumental in persuading black voters to embrace the Democratic
Party. There were other issues too, of course, such as the Depression
and the president's ill-fated attempt to name a Southern
segregationist to the Supreme Court. But Fletcher said that
embarrassing black mothers and widows "was just what the Democrats
needed to put an end to the 60-year alliance between the Republican
Party and African American voters'' that dated to the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   In Massachusetts, Gov. Frank Allen, a white Republican, warned
Hoover that disregarding black women was "ill-advised, unfair and
contrary to the ideals of our American government.'' The Nation
magazine editorialized that "surely there was no time in the history
of our country when segregation was less necessary and more cruel.''
In Congress, Rep. Oscar DePriest, a black Republican from Illinois,
called the plan "un-American.'' In Chicago, Tom Canty, a black leader
allied with Hoover, predicted political disaster. "We all make
mistakes. We will all agree to that,'' he telegrammed the White
House. "But the person who discriminated against the colored Gold
Star Mothers pulled the worst boner contributing to the
ever-increasing unpopularity of your administration . . . . It will
take some hocus pocus, raised to the nth power, to repopularize Mr.
Hoover with our people in the Middle West."</TE>
<TE>   DuBois, one of the country's most respected black leaders, a man
who alone could sway black opinion, wasted little time encouraging
his followers to abandon the GOP. "No one in our day has helped race
hatred more than Herbert Hoover by his Lily-White policy,'' he wrote.
Nor did DuBois stop there. In a scathing article in "The Crisis,''
the official voice of the NAACP, he printed a large photograph of the
first group of black women attending the City Hall ceremony in New
York. Under the caption, "Black and Gold Star Mothers,'' he attacked
the women for surrendering their dignity and traveling aboard Jim
Crow ships.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the ones that caused all the difficulty,'' he said of
the women, pictured in bright summer dresses and waving American
flags. "These are the mothers of sons murdered at their country's
command, and sent to the graves in Europe segregated on a freight
boat, lest they contaminate their fellow men. By order of President
Hoover.'' Several prominent members of the Republican National
Committee publicly expressed doubts about Hoover's reelection. The
Chicago Defender, another black publication, noted that Hoover had
not made a single move to integrate the black women. Now, the paper
said, "it remains with us to do the moving . . . . Just watch
November 1932.'' Anger ran deep, especially when there appeared a
political flier, mailed to black voters with a cartoon depicting a
commercial steamer: "LEST WE FORGET: Cattle ships for our mothers who
gave their sons.'' Hoover was defeated. And 23 proud women stayed
home.</TE>
<TE>   "I received your letter and also previously received one sent me
by the Gold Star Mothers,'' Mrs. Grace Taylor of Cambridge, Mass.,
the war widow of Isaac W. Taylor, wrote to Washington in February
1931. She was responding to yet another request that she change her
mind and comply with a segregated America. Once again she said no.
And no it would forever be.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish to say right here that I need no urging from anyone
pertaining to making the pilgrimage to France, as my mind was
completely settled when I canceled my invitation last summer. I am a
Massachusetts born woman and my parents before me and I strongly
resent any such stand as the United States government has taken and I
feel that they have grossly insulted our race. . .'' She added one
final line: "They can never make amends.''</TE>

<HD>Confession of a Child Killer</HD>
<DH>This Summer's Rash of Child Kidnappings and Murders Has
Everyone Wondering, 'Why?' But When Justin Weinberger Spotted
12-Year-Old Courtney Sconce the Day He Raped and Strangled Her, He
Was Thinking Something Far More Troubling: 'Why Not?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman</AU>
<BD>Tim Reiterman is a Times staff writer based in Northern
California.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Soon after the news raced through the Rancho Cordova neighborhood of
modest ranch-style houses, a street corner memorial cascaded across
the sidewalk. Bouquets. Votive candles. Teddy bears. The street sign
was festooned with ribbons and cards drawn by children. "I'll
remember you like family . . . ." said one.</LD>
<LD>   Townspeople in this blue-collar bedroom community about 10 miles
east of the state Capitol came to "Courtney's Corner'' to mourn and
remember a 12-year-old girl who vanished on her after-school jaunt to
the store, and then turned up dead before nightfall on a faraway
riverbank. Children and parents broke down as they clung to one
another and gazed at photographs of Courtney Hannah Sconce. It was
hard to believe, even harder to take, that someone could choke the
life out of a winsome, bright-eyed tomboy who was always on the go,
skateboarding and playing ball with the guys, running down the leafy
avenues, ponytail flying.</LD>
<TE>   The memorial also drew strangers who were moved by the tragedy, or
who were curious. One was a lanky, clean-cut college dropout and
computer buff who had saved newspaper clippings about the murder. He
pulled up in his car, stopped, looked for a moment, and drove on. No
one apparently noticed him that day shortly after Courtney's Nov. 8,
2000, murder, but that was not unusual for Justin M. Weinberger. He
had seldom attracted much attention in his 19 years. Despite a
manhunt underway for Courtney's killer, Weinberger's visit to the
memorial would remain a secret until eight months later, when he was
arrested for her murder.</TE>
<TE>   His crime was particularly disturbing because he killed just two
days after the FBI came to his home and seized his child pornography
collection. FBI officials say it may be the first time that a
child-porn search prompted such a tragedy, and the murder left
veteran agents agonizing over their handling of the case and
wondering how they might better predict when a suspect will act on
his impulses.</TE>
<TE>   This shy son of a state prosecutor did not seem to fit the
stereotype of a pedophile, let alone a rapist and murderer. He had no
lifelong rap sheet, as did the man who snatched 12-year-old Polly
Klaas from a slumber party in Petaluma and murdered her in 1993. He
was less than half the age of the 50-year-old San Diego County man
who kept child porn on his computer and was convicted last month of
killing 7-year-old Danielle van Dam in February. Unlike the suspect
arrested in the July slaying of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion of
Stanton, he had not been accused of molestation before.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberger pleaded guilty, so there was no trial, no public
airing. The forces that drove him to kill remained a mystery. "I
still cannot explain what I've done,'' he said as he was sentenced
early this year to life in prison. Weinberger later refused interview
requests routed through prison officials. But The Times was allowed
to view his videotaped confession to sheriff's detectives. It offers
not only a child killer's own account of the crime, but also insights
into what caused him to destroy two lives--Courtney Sconce's and his
own--and devastate both of their families.</TE>
<TE>   According to the video, a letter to his best friend, and
interviews with those who knew Weinberger, the ingredients for rage
and violence were churning within him, mixed into dysfunction and
loneliness hidden behind the veneer of suburban normalcy. And,
Weinberger alleged, family secrets tormented and bent him. Says his
former public defender, Carol Pulido, ''Just because you have every
advantage does not mean you have a good upbringing.''</TE>
<TE>   Justin Weinberger was a child of El Dorado Hills, a short drive
from Rancho Cordova and a leap up the economic ladder. Since about
age 6, he was raised in a three-bedroom house perched among the dusky
oaks and pines. His parents made a handsome couple. His mother was
blue-eyed, blond and chatty. She doted on Justin, dressed with flair
and drove sporty cars. His father had a supervisory job in the state
attorney general's office, a certain reticence and a ready smile. As
a youngster, Justin took piano lessons and played soccer on a team
his dad coached. He played chess with his best friend and sailed with
his parents. He had dogs, cats and a tree fort. He was often home
alone but seemed happy enough, although he had a temper.</TE>
<TE>   ''He was into video games and Nintendo,'' says childhood playmate
Bryce Porter. "His parents gave him a lot of games. He would get mad
if I beat him at Nintendo and tell me to get out of the house.''</TE>
<TE>   As a teen, Justin's life became more solitary, at home and school.
"He was a shy, very withdrawn person,'' recalls another former
neighbor Laurel Mize, who was a grade ahead of him. "He would be out
playing basketball a lot, but by himself.'' He knew computers well
enough to fix them, and he once sold software through a telemarketing
company. But having few friends, he spent long hours with the
television and the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   At Oak Ridge High, a pastoral campus cut by a tiny creek, he
enjoyed math and shied away from extracurricular activities. He was
polite, smart and showed a clever sense of humor in one-on-one
situations. But he was socially awkward, with reserve that let people
ignore him and stubbornness that grated even on friends. He was
attracted to pretty girls who dated athletes, but he knew he stood
little chance. He skipped dances and proms. He once threw a party
when his parents were out of town, hoping it would make him more
popular. Scores of kids descended on the house, but it was a fiasco.
They trashed the place.</TE>
<TE>   His lifelong buddy was a handsome football player. When he moved
to a new housing tract in nearby Rocklin, Justin hung out there. But
the local kids barely tolerated this nerdy newcomer who wore plaid
shirts and visors. They laughed at him and called him for beer money
when they were broke. "You could manipulate him so easily . . .
convince him to do anything, buy something or give it to you or drive
you somewhere," says Chris Tillisch, one of Justin's few friends
willing to be quoted by name. "My friends made fun of me for hanging
with him."</TE>
<TE>   When they went clubbing, his pals sometimes ditched him, fearing
he would spoil their chances of picking up girls. At parties, Justin
usually was flying solo. He met some women through a dating service
but the relationships did not last. He turned to prostitutes on a
Sacramento street. His mother, Janice Maureen Weinberger, made
rambling late-night calls to his closest buddy's mother. "She was
worried about him committing suicide,'' the friend's mother recalls.
When friends confronted Justin, he told them he was depressed--but
not enough to hurt himself.</TE>
<TE>   Justin's mother was grappling with her own demons. A son by her
first marriage was sentenced to life in prison for a 1992 crime spree
that included kidnapping. Later that year, when Justin was 11,
records show the Weinbergers filed for bankruptcy after his mom lost
her job. She kept tiny bottles of wine in her car, and had one
conviction for driving while intoxicated, in 1997. Justin said she
clashed with her husband about her drinking. Sometimes she asked
neighbors for a ride to the store because she was not allowed to
drive. Heaped on everything else, she was diagnosed with a blood
disorder in the mid-1990s that required transfusions.</TE>
<TE>   Justin respected his father, although he told detectives he found
him cold and controlling. He thought his mother was lonely and pitied
her. He escaped in a cloud of marijuana and other drugs. His grades
dropped during his senior year of high school, yet a strong SAT score
in math helped him gain admission in 1999 to San Diego State
University, where he majored in computer science. The cannabis smell
from his room was a running joke on his dormitory floor. He sometimes
cut classes and seemed lethargic. "He mainly stayed to himself,''
says Justin Rupert, who lived two doors away. "I can't recall many
times I actually saw him come out of his room.''</TE>
<TE>   He partied day and night when his best friend came to visit. Home
for his first winter break, he passed out during a drinking bout on
Jan. 25, 2000, and his friends photographed him sprawled with a
bottle of Jack Daniel's. Records show that an ambulance later took
him to a hospital. A month later, the scent of marijuana brought a
campus cop to his room, and the cop confiscated two marijuana pipes.
University officials declined to say whether disciplinary action was
taken. But after two semesters, Justin said in his confession, he had
failed some courses, and his father was tired of financing his
fooling around at school. He left school to help care for his dying
mother and began getting grief counseling arranged by his dad.</TE>
<TE>   By fall, he was spinning out of control. On Oct. 6, 2000, he threw
a rock and shattered the van window of another motorist pulling onto
the highway. She gave chase at high speed and got his license number.
A highway patrolman later went to his home and cited him. Justin told
friends he carried the rock just in case someone showed him
disrespect. Respect was a big thing for someone who got so little of
it.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Sconce was many things Justin Weinberger was not. Her
family called her the miracle child. Her mother Cindy's tubes were
tied, yet Courtney found her way into this world. She always would be
the baby, the youngest of three children born to Air Force veterans
who worked as health-care industry analysts. She relished ordinary
things--ice cream, her dog Tigger, roller skating, swimming in the
small backyard pool. But she stood out, with spunky charisma and
compassion that caused her to bring home poor classmates who seemed
as though they could use a good dinner.</TE>
<TE>   At 12, she was a strong-willed and promising student who was
taking geometry in the seventh grade. She dreamed of being the first
woman pro football player one week, a lawyer the next. Muscular,
quick and competitive, she could hold her own on the baseball diamond
and basketball court with the boys. She did not seem interested in
romance and dating. After her first dance, she came home saying she
was not ready for boys fussing over her. And she considered her sex
education class "gross.''</TE>
<TE>   Courtney was a warm child, and a number of her
classmates considered her their best friend. On what turned out to be her
last day of school, she hugged one of her girlfriends and parted company.
"I love you,'' they told one another. Once home, she told her brother
she was heading to Harry's Liquors &amp; Food for a snack. It was just a
few blocks from their home.</TE>
<TE>   Four months earlier and a continent away, Peggy Grow, a
Hillsborough County, Fla., sheriff's detective, had signed onto her
computer late one night. Someone in a chat room was offering:
"PRE/TEEN AcTion-HarDcOre, CloSeuPs . . . '' After downloading eight
images of girls under 14 from the operator's computer, the detective
traced the computer account through phone records to Justin's father.
Michael Weinberger was just a name to the detective, but for two
decades he was a respected, well-liked California state prosecutor
who supervised several other attorneys and fought criminal appeals,
including death penalty cases.</TE>
<TE>   The porn investigation was referred through the FBI's "Innocent
Images" task force to the Sacramento field office. It was a small
case compared to the international child-porn ring busted last month
by federal and local agencies, and the initial investigation was
handled routinely by Special Agent Kenneth G. Hittmeier. The 25-year
veteran was no stranger to sex-crime investigations or the power of
porn. He had worked on the previous year's Yosemite rapes and murders
in which the accused killer of two teenaged girls and two women
offered the FBI a confession in exchange for child porn and other
favors.</TE>
<TE>   Hittmeier scoped out the Weinberger home, then prepared a search
warrant. But one magistrate declined to sign it because he knew the
senior Weinberger. Although another judge signed the warrant, alarms
went off when the U.S. Attorney's office learned that a state
prosecutor's home was targeted. "They said, 'You better make this
search warrant airtight and bulletproof,' '' says Hittmeier. No one
wanted to see a repeat of a child-porn case involving a Sacramento
prosecutor that was thrown out over false statements in a police
search warrant affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   After more work, several agents descended on the Weinberger home
with a fresh warrant on Nov. 6, 2000. They walked into what one
described as a "horrible" situation. They didn't know who in the
household was distributing porn, and they didn't know Justin's mother
was on her deathbed. Justin answered the door and almost immediately
asked to speak to an attorney. Then his father arrived home. He
seemed surprised but cooperative, agents said in an interview. He
told them there was porn--but not child porn--on his own computer and
that he knew nothing about his son's computer. Agents carted off both
machines. An examination back at headquarters later turned up
numerous images of pre-pubescent girls on Justin's computer, agents
say, but nothing illegal on his father's.</TE>
<TE>   As Justin recounted in his videotaped confession, his father that
night told him he could go to prison for years, ruining his future.
He also fretted that the publicity would hurt his career. "He . . .
started discussing suicide that night,'' Justin said. "We started
drinking whiskey.''</TE>
<TE>   Justin said they went to the garage, fired up two cars and waited
for the carbon monoxide to do its work. He dropped off to sleep but
awoke in the morning in his own bed, not knowing how he got there.
Although Michael Weinberger declined requests for an interview, John
R. Duree Jr., his friend and Justin's former attorney, insists in
response to written questions that "Mr. Weinberger never encouraged
or suggested suicide by Justin.''</TE>
<TE>   Although their accounts of that night differ, both father and son
went the following day to the Gold Rush town of Placerville for a
court appearance in the road-rage incident. Coincidentally, the judge
hearing Justin's case was one of Michael Weinberger's former
co-workers from the attorney general's office. Justin pleaded not
guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the young man was still suicidal. The
rock-throwing incident was nothing compared to federal child-porn
charges, which Congress decreed are crimes of violence and carry
tough sentences. So he headed out, driving his mom's black BMW to
Rancho Cordova to pick up his final check at the auto parts store
where he worked as a delivery driver. Then he crossed town to a gun
shop, where owner Jerry Renville recognized him as a nice kid who
occasionally browsed. This time Justin bought a deer rifle, but the
state's mandatory waiting period prevented him from taking it.</TE>
<TE>   Driving around, he later told investigators, he grew "angry at the
FBI because I felt they were causing me and my dad to die for
basically no reason, for child pornography." He made a chilling
decision. "I never had sex with a virgin and kind of fantasized about
that,'' he said. "I figured that if I had to go to jail, I should go
for a crime that's worth going to jail for.''</TE>
<TE>   About an hour later Justin Weinberger watched children, eager to
start the long Veterans Day weekend, stream from the cinder-block
classrooms of W.E. Mitchell Middle School. He spotted a pert girl
with a ponytail. On that mild, sunny afternoon, Courtney Sconce was
wearing a white T-shirt, shorts and tennis shoes. She clutched a
bunch of purple flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Justin eased the car to the curb and got out after he struck up a
conversation with Sconce. As he recounted it, he asked directions to
a nonexistent street, then asked the girl her name. She said he had a
nice Beamer, her favorite make. But when he invited her for a ride,
she begged off, saying she was almost home. He then said he had a gun
and told her to get in. "Don't hurt me,'' he recalled her saying. He
drove off, past her favorite skating rink and onto the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of hours later and 40 miles away, Richard Harrington was
going to see his boss at La Paz Golf Club. The maintenance worker
slowed to see the dark-colored BMW parked along the Feather River
levee. He was smitten with BMWs and once had owned one. The car's
occupants were cresting the levee--a young man in cargo pants and a
little girl in shorts. "It was weird, like they were brother and
sister,'' Harrington recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Sconce's parents became anxious about their child. Her
father, Mark, found some Highway Patrol officers when he went to a
nearby Taco Bell looking for his youngest daughter, and the search
was on. As the hours passed, he had a gut feeling, a bad one.
Frantic, he drove around peering into parks, behind buildings, even
into dumpsters.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime after midnight, sheriff's deputies told them a
girl's body had been found along the Feather River. They had a Polaroid.
"They showed me that terrible picture, the one that we parents hope
we never see,'' Mark Sconce recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators converged on a sandy bank not far from a place known
as Beer Can Beach. Sutter County deputies collected evidence with
help from the state Department of Justice, where Michael Weinberger
worked. There were footprints and tire tracks, plus things the killer
left behind in haste: an Adidas visor, sunglasses, a sock, boxer
shorts and a black T-shirt with a yellow skull. Pathologists later
found the killer's DNA in Courtney.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento County Sheriff's Dets. Marci Minter and Lori Timberlake
were assigned to the case. Timberlake had attended the same school as
Courtney and knew Rancho Cordova. They thought they could solve the
case in a day or two. Footprints with no sign of a struggle suggested
the killer might have known the victim.</TE>
<TE>   The detectives started by searching Courtney's bedroom, where a
BMW poster hung on the door. There was no steady boyfriend to
question. But Courtney recently had written the name of a boy on her
hand. And there was a neighborhood ruffian. For three days,
investigators fanned out, generating so many leads that a task force
was formed. A toll-free hotline sizzled with tips that were fed into
a computer. The FBI and other investigators questioned registered sex
offenders and pulled over BMW owners. They visited body shops and
wrecking yards looking for the car. They viewed store security camera
footage. They hung out at the skate rink and Courtney's school.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, there was a way to rule out suspects--DNA testing.
Each was asked for a sample of skin cells taken from inside the
cheek. Then the state lab in Berkeley compared the sample to the
killer's DNA. A sex offender who owned a BMW was eliminated. So were
Courtney's father, brother and many others.</TE>
<TE>   While hundreds of people were questioned, Justin Weinberger went
about his life, even attended a friend's birthday barbecue a few days
after he had killed. Although he shed tears, he was composed enough
to speak at his mother's memorial service a few weeks later. But he
began acting recklessly. Records show he was in a car accident--his
second in nine weeks--and was stopped for a seatbelt violation. He
also had violent outbursts, punching holes in a wall at a party and
tangling with a friend who threw Weinberger's cat off the bed. His
friends dismissed his behavior as a response to his mother's death.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberger began to believe he might get away with murder. He
started a job as an administrative assistant for a construction
company. He enrolled in computer courses at a local junior college.
And he dutifully made court appearances in the rock-throwing case.
The victim in that case, hair salon owner Autom Specht, had pressed
the district attorney's office to file a misdemeanor criminal
complaint. But the prosecutor persuaded her to endorse a plea deal
that dismissed one of the charges and allowed Weinberger to cleanse
his record--if he paid restitution and underwent anger management
counseling.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was busted down because of Michael Weinberger's
position, because it was represented to me that he was with the
attorney general's office and it would be handled at home,'' Specht
says.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberger served as his son's attorney in the rock-throwing case,
and his state business card was stapled in the court file. Attorney
general's spokesman Nathan Barankin says Weinberger's role did not
violate state conflict-of-interest rules, although he says the state
prosecutor did not get the required permission to represent a family
member. Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Jones denied favoritism in the
plea deal. No one was hurt, Justin had a clean record and he accepted
responsibility. Besides, Jones added, "I . . . was advised that mom
had just died of cancer and the son was reacting badly to the
death.''</TE>
<TE>   The federal government also unwittingly gave a break to the
killer. Federal investigators and prosecutors felt that some child
pornographers of roughly Justin's age and criminal history had
received excessively long prison terms under federal sentencing
guidelines. Instead of proceeding with federal charges that could
have led to at least five years in prison, they handed Justin's case
over to El Dorado County prosecutors, who filed charges on May 22,
2001. Now that he was facing state charges instead of federal
charges, Justin was subject to less than a year's jail time. His was
a test case, and the people who made that decision took some comfort
from a psychiatric evaluation provided by his attorney, Duree, which
they felt indicated that the young man was not likely to act on his
sexual impulses. Justin pleaded not guilty on May 29, 2001, and was
freed on $7,500 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Duree says Justin received no special consideration in either case
due to his father's position or acquaintances, one of whom was
federal prosecutor Doug Hendricks. As head of the U.S. Attorney's
violent crime unit, Hendricks, a Weinberger neighbor, says he had no
role in the handling of the child-porn charges. U.S. Attorney John
Vincent declined to discuss the case.</TE>
<TE>   As months dragged by and Courtney's murder went unsolved, Mark and
Cindy Sconce lived in the foggy hell of the unknown. They had
nightmares about Courtney's last moments. Not knowing whether the
killer was close to the family, they feared for their other children.
They picked through Courtney's belongings for overlooked clues. They
reported every dark BMW they saw. They fielded calls from reporters,
tipsters and crackpots. They pleaded publicly for the killer's family
to turn him in.</TE>
<TE>   Other parents in Rancho Cordova were afraid to let their little
ones out of sight. Children were afraid to sleep with the lights off.
Some of Courtney's playmates developed emotional problems.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Sconce could not cope with the questions and sympathy of
people at work. He stayed away for three months and then quit. He
turned to tequila to numb the pain. Finally, he packed up his family
and moved away from his house full of memories that was only a few
doors from Courtney's Corner. The murder had thrown the community
into a cycle of monthly candlelight vigils there.</TE>
<TE>   The breakthrough came when the FBI began tracing the articles the
killer left behind. When Special Agent Bill Nicholson set out to
track the blue Adidas visor, he feared there were a million of them.
But he found out that it was a relatively new model. Using a list of
local retailers from an Adidas representative, he learned that 21
visors had been purchased with credit cards in the Sacramento area.
Search warrants served on the banks yielded names of purchasers.</TE>
<TE>   The impossible suddenly looked promising. On July 9, 2001, eight
months after the murder, Nicholson gathered several agents in his
work cubicle. He had folders with each purchaser's name, address and
photo. He wanted a criminal history check, an interview and a DNA
sample for each. "For instance, here's a guy who's 20 years old . . .
'' he said, holding up one photo.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that guy," said Hittmeier, who recognized the face from a
previous child porn search. "That's Justin Weinberger.''</TE>
<TE>   Hittmeier and his partner, Jeff Rinek, made tracks back to the
Weinberger home. Justin was not there. His father was, and he looked
drained. Normally, Hittmeier says, the agents might have just asked
the father to let them know when his son returned. Instead they
spelled out why they were there. "Probably . . . we treated him
differently than we would anyone else because he was in law
enforcement or a prosecutor,'' the agent says. "I think he would
understand, and his demeanor had always been cooperative.''</TE>
<TE>   Weinberger assured the agents that Justin would return later that
day, and that they would be in contact. But that did not happen.</TE>
<TE>   Justin was whiling away the afternoon drinking beer at Folsom Lake
with the Rocklin crowd when his cell phone rang. His dad told him to
come home right away because the FBI had shown up wanting his DNA. He
rushed off, telling friends he needed to go to school. Once Justin
got home, he said his father told him investigators had traced the
visor. Things looked dismal. "I told him I was going to flee,''
Justin said, "and he said he was going to kill himself.''</TE>
<TE>   During the next two hours, Justin stuffed practically everything
he owned into his Honda. He told investigators that his father warned
that he might get caught immediately. "I love you and always have,''
he said he told his dad, then drove away, heading east, using back
roads.</TE>
<TE>   At the FBI, a day passed with no word from Michael Weinberger.
Sensing that something was seriously wrong, Rinek tried to reach him
by phone the next day. Then he learned that Justin's best friend had
received an odd voice mail from him: The FBI was falsely accusing him
of something and he was fleeing. The agent raced to the Weinberger
home, then contacted the attorney general's office. Rinek says a
friend of Justin's father reported he had been hospitalized after a
suicide attempt. A missing persons notice saying Justin was wanted
for questioning went out to law enforcement agencies nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Weinberger made his way from Northern California to New
Mexico. Grabbing another girl crossed his mind. But, feeling lonely,
he picked up two male hitchhikers. After drinking and smoking pot,
they created a ruckus at the Texan Motel in Raton, a hilly town on
the Santa Fe Trail. The desk clerk called police, but they got away.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later, a surveillance camera captured them trying to get
into a closed supermarket. This time police rounded them up and found
that Weinberger was wanted for questioning in California. Within a
day, Sacramento Sheriff's Dets. Minter and Timberlake flew to
Albuquerque, where Weinberger had been moved. They found him amiable
and articulate, but sweating profusely, his leg pumping.</TE>
<TE>   He told the detectives that he did not know Courtney and was
merely taking a road trip to New York. He also asked about his dad's
well-being and expressed concern about his car. The detectives said
they offered to check on the car and got Weinberger's permission to
search it.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, in a little garage in Raton, they picked through the
Honda and found child porn hidden inside a Hustler magazine. But they
also discovered newspapers featuring stories about Courtney's murder,
photos of Weinberger wearing sunglasses like those with her body, and
T-shirts and boxer shorts similar to ones found at the murder scene.
Then Timberlake popped the trunk and found something that set her
yelling--a blue Saucony running shoe that matched the size and
pattern of sole prints at the murder site.</TE>
<TE>   The detectives went back to Weinberger, but he maintained his
innocence. "I'll see you in Sacramento,'' Timberlake told him. And
they went home with the damning evidence and something even more
important--a DNA sample earlier obtained by Raton police at their
request. The sample was rushed to the state DNA lab in Berkeley. A
few days later, on July 19, 2001, Timberlake was sitting in the
sheriff's homicide squad room with Nicholson of the FBI when her boss
came in holding a balloon. "Congratulations,'' it said.</TE>
<TE>   A news conference was called, but Weinberger's arrest for murder
was bittersweet for the agents involved in the child porn case. They
second-guessed themselves, even though they believed there was little
basis to immediately arrest him and none to think he would kill a
child two days after they seized his computer. "I guess I feel a
little like I missed something,'' Hittmeier says. "Like maybe . . we
should have seen something that would maybe tip us off as to what he
might have been doing or planning to do.''</TE>
<TE>   After Weinberger was extradited from New Mexico, Timberlake and
Minter gingerly walked him through four hours of questioning while
the video camera rolled. After hearing the DNA results, he said he
wanted the death penalty, waived his Miranda rights and freely told
his story.</TE>
<TE>   As he aimed the BMW down the highway, he said, Courtney was
frightened. "She wanted to know where we were going. I didn't really
tell her anything.'' He talked to her about music and school to calm
her. It turned out they both liked math. He exited the highway where
rice fields give way to walnut orchards hugging the Feather River. By
the time they scaled the levee, Weinberger said, Courtney seemed
relatively relaxed. He almost made the kidnapping sound like a
date--a common fantasy scripted by molesters, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   They stopped above the peaceful, green river. He said he told her
to take off her clothes, then he took away her innocence. When he
finished, he said she dressed and they sat watching the current and
talking. She said she should call her parents and was worried about
getting pregnant. She also seemed genuinely concerned when he said he
wanted to kill himself. Or so he said.</TE>
<TE>   A half hour later, he wanted to have sex with her again, and they
walked to the shoreline. When he began raping her the second time, he
said she cried for him to stop. Anger and fear surged through him.
"It crossed my mind that she could identify me . . . something told
me that if I'm gonna get away with it, I'll have to kill her.''</TE>
<TE>   When Weinberger began choking her, he said she flailed and fought.
He said he cried the whole time, yet he later had the presence of
mind to drag her body to the water and try to wash away his DNA. He
darted for cover at the sound of an approaching boat, but two
fishermen pulled directly into the cove. Grabbing his shoes and some
of his clothes, Weinberger said he scrambled for the car. Naked, he
roared away, Courtney's flowers still in the car.</TE>
<TE>   During his confession, Weinberger painted a twisted backdrop for
his crimes, blaming others without excusing himself. "I'm not trying
to say it was not my fault,'' he said. "It really never would have
happened if the FBI had not come to my house on that Monday . . . .
The way my dad was talking it made it seem like my life was over . .
. . I knew my mom was going to die . . . . We were talking about
committing suicide, and I guess I kind of retaliated.''</TE>
<TE>   He said he first chanced upon child porn at the age of about 13 on
someone else's computer, then he later claimed that it was his
parents'. But he was protective of his father, saying the older man
had not looked at kiddie porn for years and had warned Justin to stay
away from it because the FBI might come after him. Duree, Michael
Weinberger's friend and Justin's former attorney, wrote, "Neither Mr.
Weinberger nor his wife ever used or viewed child pornography.'' FBI
investigators did not turn up any child pornography on the senior
Weinberger's computer. They said they focused on Justin's computer,
the only one in the house with a high-speed Internet hookup.</TE>
<TE>   When the sheriff's detectives asked whether Justin had been
sexually molested--which experts say is common among child
molesters--he said, "There was stuff between my mom and me [in his
teens] . . . I know I thought it was really weird at some point.''
Months later he made a similar statement in a letter that a friend
shared with the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Justin's mother is not alive to dispute her son's allegation, and
Duree flatly denies it on his father's behalf. Her mother and two
sisters say they do not discount Justin's allegations, partly because
of his mother's sexual conduct. Kenneth Lanning, a Manassas, Va.,
consultant and former FBI expert on victimization of children, says,
"He may have been molested by his mother, or may have been exposed to
porn by his father, but [he] also can rationalize [his crime] by
saying, 'I was a victim myself.' ''</TE>
<TE>   The detectives asked Justin whether his father knew that he killed
Courtney. He said the news reports of the black BMW and other
evidence made his father suspicious, but said he always insisted to
his father that he had nothing to do with the murder. "He told me
that he had been having chest pains . . . and losing sleep over it
because he thought it could have been me.''</TE>
<TE>   John Duree wrote that Michael Weinberger had "no knowledge of
Justin's involvement in the Courtney Sconce homicide until FBI agents
advised him of their investigation in July of 2001.'' Justin's
assertions, he said, were those of a "troubled and desperate young
man'' who was angry that "his father had not come to his aid
following disclosure of Justin's involvement in the Courtney Sconce
homicide."</TE>
<TE>   Before Justin Weinberger was sentenced in February, many of the
"victim impact'' statements filed with the court called for his
death. But Courtney's parents left that decision up to the
prosecutor, who in light of Weinberger's youth and record recommended
a life sentence without parole on top of a 10-year federal sentence
for possessing and distributing child pornography. Weinberger waived
his right to appeal, and he went off to federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   Michael J. Heimbach, head of the FBI's Crimes Against Children
Unit in Washington, says he knows of no other case where a search
warrant for child porn triggered such violence. Field agents have
been put on notice that it happened, so that they can learn from it.
"The signs that we are trained to look for were not there,'' he says,
noting that Justin had virtually no criminal record. "It is an
extremely sad situation and the agents have struggled with it
internally.''</TE>
<TE>   The families of the killer and his victim have struggled, too.
Michael Weinberger, who continues to work at the attorney general's
office, "is torn apart by this,'' his attorney says. "He is a decent
and honorable person, and I think he is puzzled and wonders what he
did or didn't do that may have prevented or contributed to Justin's
conduct. Justin was not an abused kid in a terrible family. Both
parents loved him.''</TE>
<TE>   Mark Sconce is haunted by the question his daughter's killer left
hanging at his sentencing. "Every day and every night when I go to
bed," Sconce says, "I am thinking, 'Why did he do it?'"</TE>
<TE>   The only remnants of the memorial at Courtney's Corner are wax
stains on the sidewalk, but she is not forgotten. At the bus stop
outside her school, a spindly Chinese tallow tree with heart-shaped
leaves shades a bench dedicated to her memory. A plaque on it reads:
"She played hard and lived life to the fullest every minute of her
short life.''</TE>

<LD>Approaching the intersection of Echo Park Avenue and Sunset Boulevard
these days is like opening a box of glowing gemstones. The
spectacular new mural that adorns the prenatal and postnatal care
center on the northeast corner emits a neighborly luminescence that's
visible for blocks. Lush lotus leaves painted on the clinic's roll-up
doors give way to the mural's focal point, a radiant earth mother
figure extending around the building from its corner edge. Over her
heart, a flame glimmers amid the petals of a lotus blossom--a salute
to the giant lotuses that bloom each year at Echo Park Lake only
blocks away. The figure is joined by scenes of community life
rendered in bright hues and tawny earth tones.</LD>
<TE>   A year and a half in the making, "Sculpting Another Destiny" was
completed in April at the behest of the city of Los Angeles under a
federal "Targeted Neighborhood Initiative" grant. The title and
images are the work of Ricardo Mendoza, who received the commission
after answering a solicitation issued by the office of
then-Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. Mendoza says a chief inspiration
was Central American poet Claribel Alegria, whose work often
addresses social justice issues. "I read a line where she talks about
sculpting a new destiny," says Mendoza, 40, who associates the
mural's imagery with the "river of life" and the "sacred fire."
Mendoza, who was reared in Pennsylvania and Costa Mesa, says he
executed his design with the help of eight or nine others, from
established artists to local kids.</TE>
<TE>   Though Mendoza set up shop in a downtown warehouse during the
early '80s and graduated from the Otis Art Institute, mural painting
became a calling only gradually. His post-teen slacker phase included
a couple of days assisting artist Judy Baca on the world's longest
mural, "The Great Wall of Los Angeles" along the Tujunga Wash flood
control channel in Van Nuys. "I was 19 and thought they were nuts. It
was the middle of summer in the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade or so, Mendoza's work has appeared on walls in
Long Beach, Wilmington and, more recently, Silver Lake, at Councilman
Eric Garcetti's Sunset Boulevard field office. He was also
commissioned by the nonprofit Social and Public Art Resource Center
to paint a mural in Canoga Park. This spring, HBO ordered a
50-by-10-foot mural for the promotion of "Real Women Have Curves," a
new film adapted from the play by Josefina Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   But the Garcetti office mural and the new work in Echo Park (which
has already appeared in a video by the Red Hot Chili Peppers)
resonate more deeply for the artist. With property values rising in
the area, public art often contends with bureaucratic hurdles and
upscale homeowner oversight committees, Mendoza says, adding that
Angelenos often forget that L.A.'s status as a world-class city owes
partly to the 25-year-plus art-making tradition that made its
reputation as "mural capital of the world."</TE>
<TE>   At Sunset and Echo Park, however, there's no lack of appreciation.
Basking in the glow, perhaps, the former Pacific Alliance Medical
Center has recently changed its name. Mendoza plans to add the new
signage to the mural in the coming months: Sunshine Medical Clinic.</TE>

<DH>Bice in Pasadena's Paseo Colorado Is the Latest in a Chain
That Started in Milan</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I heard the famous Milan restaurant Bice was opening a branch in
Pasadena's new Paseo Colorado, my first thought was, "Why?" Bice had
opened a high-profile Beverly Hills restaurant in 1989, which managed
to hang on, just, for almost five years before closing. They want to
try again? Even in Milan, Bice is beloved more for its elegant,
old-fashioned ambience and solicitous waiters than for its rather
staid food. The historic restaurant not far from the Duomo is also a
Milan fashionista haunt, which helps. Bice started in 1926 and now is
in more than two dozen cities around the world.</LD>
<LD>   In opening the Pasadena Bice, unlike at their Beverly Hills
locale, the Bice Group didn't go in for the grandiose. Tucked away in
Paseo Colorado, across from Border Grill, this one is a relatively
modest affair joined at the hip with Cafe Med, another Bice
Group-owned restaurant. After you find Bice in the maze of the Paseo,
the bartender or maitre d' may well ask, "Which restaurant?" when you
mention a reservation.</LD>
<TE>   Mexico City-based restaurant designer Yolanda Bagatella has done a
terrific job of conjuring a chic northern Italian ambience from a
standard boxy storefront. The floor is striped in wide bands of dark
and light hardwood; a small bar at the front welcomes guests; and
banquettes lit with oversized white silk lampshades give Bice a more
urbane look than its suburban setting would suggest. If they could
only fill the room. If only Paseo Colorado could feel less like,
well, a shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, everyone who walks in the door gets a big welcome
from maitre d' Ben-Hur Ranieri, a Bice veteran. Raffaele Ruggeri,
that slender handsome Italian walking the room, looks as if he
stepped out of the pages of Italian Vogue. He's director of West
Coast expansion and a third-generation family member. At Bice
Pasadena, you get a real waiter, not an actor, though they could try
to act more helpful and interested. As it is, most seem more like
union waiters without a shred of interest in the restaurant or the
business. Ask a question, it may not get answered. Ask for tap water,
you may get a bottle of Italian aqua gassata--bubbly water.</TE>
<TE>   The menu under chef Julian Baker, who comes from Bice's European
operation, adds some California-influenced dishes to the Milan
restaurant's classic northern Italian fare. Salads are generally good
bets, nicely presented and green enough to appeal to California
tastes. One that's particularly successful is the chopped salad of
endive, radicchio and frisee in a subtle roasted garlic dressing.</TE>
<TE>   Soups are generally good, too. Asparagus soup one night is creamy
and studded with nuggets of lobster.</TE>
<TE>   But the beef carpaccio, made with lean rosy beef, is doused with
so much truffle oil, it's virtually ruined. Much better is the
marinated swordfish carpaccio garnished with diced melon and ribbons
of mint, an inspired combination. Salmon carpaccio tastes watery, but
all it needs is a squeeze of lemon to bring it, and the accompanying
fennel salad, back to life. On the sliced meat front, bresaola is
less pungent than the usual air-dried beef, which may not be to
everyone's taste. The artichoke salad on top is bizarre, and has more
Parmesan than artichokes, so it's like eating straight cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Dainty appetizers such as the thumb-sized rolls of raw tuna
(that's the California touch) stuffed with a fluffy crab salad show
off this kitchen's garnishing skills. But if you're thinking about
ordering risotto as a first course, don't. The portions are
definitely American-sized, meant more as main courses than starters,
and in the Milanese style, heavy on the cheese. That said, both the
traditional risotto streaked with saffron and another of shrimp with
zucchini and zucchini flowers are well-crafted.</TE>
<TE>   Pastas, for the most part, are mundane. Green ravioli stuffed with
potato and leek delivers, but pappardelle with mozzarella would feel
fresher if the chef hadn't dosed the tomato sauce with so much cream.
My guest who ordered fettuccine with lobster passes me his plate when
he can't find a single bite of lobster. It's there, cut very fine and
in minute quantities, but he's still disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   I would go a long way for a proper cotoletta alla Milanese, but
Bice's breaded veal cutlet falls short in flavor: It's the quality of
the veal. Aside from a pleasant veal entrecote with a medley of
vegetables, the kitchen seems to be stronger with fish. Halibut comes
proudly to the table cooked in parchment paper, perfumed with black
olive tapenade. And a light "bouillabaisse" sauce with clams and
mussels is a fine foil for poached salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Bice's desserts include a serviceable tiramisu. Panna cotta gets
dressed up with red berries, the better to charm you. But the best is
a special we got one night when the kitchen was out of chocolate
cake. The chef whipped up some bomboloni, and these were the best
thing in the house. Think doughnut holes, warm and rolled in sugar.
If more of the food at Bice was as spontaneous as this, the Pasadena
restaurant might have more of its own identity. As it is, it's just
another corporate restaurant--OK, but nothing special.</TE>

<LD>Who says there's no cul-cha in Hollywood? Locals whose idea of
creative foment goes beyond tanning salon sessions, Scientology
meetings and the occasional actor's showcase can drop in at Smart
Gals Speakeasy, a monthly "semi-literary salon with a literal twist,"
complete with author guest hosts, secret passwords and a rotating
mystery theme.</LD>
<LD>   After gaining entry by giving the evening's password (open sesames
have included "Dead man's curve is no place to play" and "What's the
dizzle my nizzle?"), Speakeasy participants glean clues to the
night's theme from parlor games such as "passing the orange" or
"Foreign or Domestic?" a quiz on the origins of notables such as
Pamela Anderson and Langston Hughes. Sample salon themes: "Sunset
Boulevard" or "Hot Under the Collar." At one recent Speakeasy, guests
received name tags featuring such monikers as David Koresh, Drew
Barrymore, Rae Dawn Chong and Joan of Arc. What theme could possibly
tie these folks together? "They were all incendiary," says Speakeasy
founder Christine Louise Berry, a writer and performance artist who
works at Dutton's Brentwood Bookstore and Skylight Books in Los Feliz
and meets many of the Speakeasy's guest hosts while on the job.</LD>
<TE>   Berry arrived in Los Angeles 10 years ago after studying
performing arts at UC San Diego. She landed bit parts in Hollywood
flicks but decided to focus on Smart Gals, her nonprofit arts
organization whose performance series "Are You Interested?" has
produced a Labor Day show in an El Segundo machine shop and an April
15 Taxation show in an empty bank. Berry dreamed up the Speakeasy in
2001 to offer L.A. a more informal arts experience and held the first
evening in February of this year. "I was tired of creating for the
same people in the isolated world of art venues," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Each Speakeasy spotlights a guest visual artist such as Billy
Vasquez or Ronit Kirchman, who designs a collectible $10 bookmark for
the event (the price includes drinks for the evening). Along with
local artists, musicians and authors, Berry says, the series draws a
lively mix of participants, from retired folks to psychiatrists to
moms. "It's a little bit lowbrow sometimes," she says. "But it's
introducing people to local artists in a friendly environment.''</TE>

Room of One's Own, 6545 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood; (310)

<LD>Don't expect Gotham Chopra to rest on the laurels of his New Age guru
father, Deepak. As a three-year correspondent for the youth-oriented
news program Channel One, Chopra, 27, has traversed time and combat
zones few care to dare. In his recently published "Familiar
Strangers: Uncommon Wisdom in Unlikely Places" (Doubleday), Chopra
spins true tales of rebels in Chechnya; Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka;
drug warlords in Bogota. On the lighter side, Chopra story-edited
"Bulletproof Monk," a Flypaper Press and Image Comics miniseries
re-released last month and set for the big screen early next year as
a John Woo and Terence Chang-produced MGM feature starring Chow Yun
Fat.</LD>
<LD>   Do you fear for your safety in the war zones you've reported on?</LD>
<LD>   The world has changed. Before, I felt like Indiana Jones and it
was great. But now there's a palpable sense of being in danger every
time you step into the world as an American. The Daniel Pearl
sensibility is real.</LD>
<TE>   Does the Chopra name help or hinder?</TE>
<TE>   At first I think there was an expectation that I'd bring a
sensitivity to more emotive, softer stories. But for me, it was, ''I
want to go to war, to the trenches, to the front lines.'' I can
explore it in my own sensitive, thoughtful way, but that's the
setting I want to be in.</TE>
<TE>   What do you believe links all these conflict areas together?</TE>
<TE>   Greed and religious fanaticism, I think. It's a potent combo. I
consider religion the greatest plague that has ever descended upon
humankind. More people have died in the name of God than for any
other reason in the history of civilization. Spirituality is great,
but religion is not. Greed speaks for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Did your dad really raise you in keeping with the precepts
outlined in his books?</TE>
<TE>   Very much. But it wasn't like he wrote these "7 Spiritual Laws" in
our house and posted them on the refrigerator. I've always been close
to both my parents, and there's never really been anything that I was
hesitant to discuss with them. Because of my dad, I get questions on
parenting all the time and I'm not even a parent. I don't have any
pearls of wisdom on these things yet.</TE>
<TE>   It seems a long way from Pakistan to "Bulletproof Monk." How did
comic books get you?</TE>
<TE>   I was hired on as a writer/creator/editor. It's a great story.
It's based on the historical fact that a team of scientists [was]
dispatched in 1941 by Adolf Hitler in search of the origins of the
Aryan gene. They traced it to the Indo-Tibetan region, where [in the
comic book] some Tibetan monks are having tests performed on them by
Nazi scientists. The "Bulletproof Monk" saves the group and
disappears. Fifty years later he surfaces and is charged with finding
his successor. It's pretty cool.</TE>
<TE>   Does India draw you on any level?</TE>
<TE>   I'm spending a lot more time there with my grandmother since my
[paternal] grandfather died about a year and a half ago. She began
telling me these stories about my grandfather and how they met and
how my parents met, and all the family scandals. I'd come home and
tell my dad and he'd add more of his own. [Traditionally,] the oldest
son is supposed to carry his father's ashes within 36 hours up to the
Ganges and spread them. At this spot, there's an old monastery with a
long lineage of monks to whom you tell your seminal life stories and
they'll record them. When my dad went for the first time, he learned
that my grandfather had been there three times; my great-grandfather
had been there; it went back six generations. That's the mystical
part of India that enchants me.</TE>
<TE>   Tell us about your wedding this past May.</TE>
<TE>   My wife [Dr. Candice Chen, 27, a medical intern in Los Angeles] is
Chinese and we had a traditional Chinese banquet. The wedding
ceremony was Sikh [Chopra's mother, Rita Chopra, is Sikh]. I wore a
traditional white turban and so did my dad, who was totally into it.
We held a big party at an old Gothic cathedral in Manhattan that was
completely redesigned. It was certainly not a cookie-cutter
experience.</TE>
<TE>   How important is success to you?</TE>
<TE>   Of course you want your book to be on the bestseller list, you
want your movie to make millions of dollars, you want everything. But
at some level you just do it because you love to do it. It goes where
it should go.</TE>
