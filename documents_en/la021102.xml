<HD>Acting out crime sprees with celebrity voices</HD>
<DH>Ray Liotta is Tommy in 'Vice City,' adding a film-like
realism to the creative action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tommy can't swim. It's his one weakness, an unlikely flaw for the
tough guy with the Ray Liotta voice, this criminal for hire, a
survivor of mobster shoot-outs and exploding sports cars. But one
wrong step into the drink and he's helpless as an infant, sinking to
oblivion, hired muscle asleep with the fishes.</LD>
<LD>   Tommy is the central character in "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,"
the sequel to "Grand Theft Auto III" released this week to
PlayStation2 gamers anxious to cruise the streets of a fictional
Florida resort town infested with crime. Which means Tommy is you,
just out of prison after 15 years, and assigned by local mob kingpins
to special errands amid sunshine and mayhem.</LD>
<LD>   Much effort has been made recently in translating hit video games
into feature films, with mostly disappointing results. But "Vice
City" makes that struggle virtually irrelevant. The game is already a
movie, or at least enough of a step in the convergence of games and
film to suggest a wave of the future.</LD>
<TE>   Sales of video games already rival the movie business, largely on
the strength of games like "GTA III," which in the last year has sold
7 million copies (at nearly $50 each). Game companies have already
begun recruiting Hollywood talent, and "Vice City" takes things
further with a cast headed by Liotta, Burt Reynolds and Dennis
Hopper.</TE>
<TE>   "Vice City" is not the massive step forward that "GTA III"
represented, with its endless, wide-open game-play in a world heavy
with detail. It merely builds on the same technology and game-playing
engine that was already in place, refining and deepening storytelling
experience, a true sequel in the way that "The Empire Strikes Back"
was to the original "Star Wars."</TE>
<TE>   This time the story is set in the pastel '80s of "Miami Vice" and
"Scarface," where supercops drive Lamborghini's and drug kingpins
settle arguments with a chainsaw. Missions send players on endless
drug deals and double-crosses, many of them scenes lifted lovingly
from modern gangster films.</TE>
<TE>   A large part of "Vice City's" unlikely greatness comes from an
obsessive attention to detail that some gamers may not immediately
recognize on the road to crime and punishment. This is a fully
realized world, from luxury hotels to crime-infested slums, with a
range of social classes and changing weather (down to the water
droplets that appear on your screen). It can also be heard in the
period music and scripted talk.</TE>
<TE>   In "Grand Theft Auto," as in many other games, the player is the
one-man crime wave, which has earned producer Rockstar Games a storm
of criticism. But the game is clearly labeled as "mature"
entertainment. In the right hands, it's as real and as harmless as
paintball, with sexual innuendo no more appalling than a typical
issue of Maxim.</TE>

<HD>Tribute to the father of Goth</HD>
<DH>Edgar Allan Poe's spirit is evoked in a Halloween show with
the likes of Lou Reed and Karen Black.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Baltin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edgar Allan Poe died more than 150 years ago, but as arguably the
father of modern Goth, he never goes out of style.</LD>
<LD>   To celebrate that legacy, music producer Hal Willner assembled an
eclectic array of talent including rock singer Lou Reed, actors Karen
Black and Howard Hesseman, and comedian Will Ferrell for "Never Bet
the Devil Your Head," his fifth annual tribute to Poe and his second
at UCLA's Royce Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Clocking in at just under four hours, "Never Bet the Devil Your
Head" had it all, with eight readings, eight songs, a backing band
that included strings and a theremin, performance art, a brief
choreographed martial arts dance and a Goth stage design.</LD>
<TE>   Maintaining the pacing in such a multimedia event is difficult,
and there were times when it lagged. Still, the highlights offset the
lulls.</TE>
<TE>   A segment with Reed and actress Chloe Webb that included dialogue
and a version of the Velvet Underground's "Candy Says" came closest
to achieving Willner's vision of a sort of theatrical hybrid.</TE>
<TE>   Reed and his band also performed 1973's "The Bed" and an elegant,
string-based version of his ballad "Perfect Day." He also read an
updated version of "The Raven," which he dubbed "The Re-Raven."</TE>
<TE>   Of the readings, Black's dramatic rendering of "The Fall of the
House of Usher" and Chloe Webb's poignant "For Annie," which reminded
that Poe could also convey great sentiment, were the most memorable.</TE>
<TE>   The revelation of the night was the New York singer Antony, who
recalled the cabaret side of Irish avant-cabaret singer Gavin Friday.</TE>
<TE>   By the time singer Kembra, painted green and flanked by two nearly
nude dancers, finished a punk rock version of "My Heart Will Go On"
just after midnight, Willner, in his surreal eclecticism, had
conveyed the spirit of both Poe and Halloween.</TE>

<HD>It's the spirit that counts</HD>
<DH>The Rolling Stones concentrate on what they do best:
energetic, guitar-driven rock that makes the aging crowd at Staples
feel young.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the way into Staples Center for the Rolling Stones concert on
Thursday, it was amusing to see a stack of tiny replicas of the
band's famous tongue logo for sale at lobby souvenir stands.</LD>
<LD>   Tucked in between the $450 leather jackets and $35 T-shirts, the
tongues, which are designed to flash in the dark, are the Stones
equivalent of the souvenir glow sticks that thousands of kids wave
gleefully at Britney Spears concerts.</LD>
<LD>   Surely the Stones brain trust must be joking.</LD>
<TE>   Loving parents may buy the Britney batons by the handful to bring
out the smiles in their 8-to-14-year-olds, but, hey, there aren't any
kids at Stones concerts. And what adult is going to pay $10 for these
silly little lighted tongues? You could imagine crates of them socked
away in some Iowa warehouse at the end of the tour.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened Thursday?</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of forty- and fiftysomethings bought the red-and-blue
tongues, which flashed constantly during the two-hour concert, a
symbol of the long-standing bond between the Stones and their
audience.</TE>
<TE>   In all the head-scratching lately over why the Stones continue to
excite fans, the answer may be something as simple as the fact that
they still make us all feel like teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you start me up, I'll never stop," an energetic, still trim
Mick Jagger sang Thursday during one of the Stones' signature hits,
and the line pretty much defines the promise that the band made to
its audience decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Jagger and Keith Richards aren't especially artful or deep as
lyricists a la Bob Dylan, another rock veteran who continues to touch
us deeply. But it's not the words that matter with the Stones. It's
the guitar-driven music.</TE>
<TE>   As teenagers in the '50s, Jagger, Richards and the other Stones
absorbed the rich, stirring strains of such American R&amp;B and blues
artists as Chuck Berry, Elmore James and Muddy Waters so fully that
their own music has been a virtual road map to that classic sound.</TE>
<TE>   The purity of that vision has a forever-young quality that has
enabled the Stones to be immune to advancing age, the shifting of
images and the loss of their songwriting powers.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't connect with every number Thursday. Some of the
choices felt arbitrary, especially the O'Jays hit "Love Train," and
the funk jam during "Can't You Hear Me Knocking" took the group on a
tedious detour.</TE>
<TE>   But they hit home runs as easily as Barry Bonds when they stuck to
their strength. In fact, there was a feeling at times that the crowd
would have been just as excited if the Stones had put aside their
21-song set list and just played the same four songs over and over.</TE>
<TE>   Between "Honky Tonk Women," "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,"
"Tumbling Dice" and "Start Me Up," you can find pretty much
everything about the Stones that has made them stars for four
decades--mystery, rebellion, cockiness and self-affirmation.</TE>
<TE>   It's not an especially wide emotional or musical wavelength, but
every piece connects to a sound so soulful and stirring that it has
become as important a part of pop culture as Dylan's lyrics or
Superman's cape.</TE>
<TE>   "Street Fighting Man'' and "Rocks Off" also mirrored the energy
and rejoice of the basic Stones approach.</TE>
<TE>   On stage, Jagger still prances with his trademark panache, and he
sings every lyric as if it were as meaningful as when the song was
first recorded. But it is Richards who truly ignites a spark every
time his right hand hits the strings. It's no accident he's in the
spotlight at center stage cradling his guitar virtually every time
the group goes into one of its classic tunes.</TE>
<TE>   The man who pretty much defined the gunslinger guitarist image
certainly doesn't generate that core Stones sound alone. He has had
some superb six-string partners over the years, from the late Brian
Jones and Mick Taylor to Ron Wood, who interacts marvelously with him
now. And Charlie Watts' masterful, economical drumming and Darryl
Jones' sensual bass lines frame the guitar touches commandingly.
Still, Richards serves as the band's musical compass.</TE>
<TE>   For the group's first tour in three years, the focus is on '70s
material--including four songs from "Exile on Main Street" -- rather
than the '60s catalog that first brought the group fame. Besides
Jones, the supporting cast this time around includes Chuck Leavell on
keyboards, three backup singers and a four-piece brass section.
Sheryl Crow, whose music draws on many of the classic values of '60s
rock, was the well-received opening act.</TE>
<TE>   The visuals here were limited to a giant video screen above the
rear of the stage, mostly devoted to shots of the band members. There
is also a second stage at the opposite of the arena where the band
played a few numbers before returning to the main stage for a final
burst of that guitar spectacle in "Jumpin' Jack Flash."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that scores of fans came in Halloween costumes added to
the evening's youthful tone--as did the unguarded enthusiasm of
couples who danced and hugged in their excitement. By concert's end,
it was nearly midnight. But the audience could have danced on and on.
It shows what revisiting youth can do for you.</TE>

<KH>ART REVIEW</KH>
<HD>In a distinctly American grove</HD>
<DH>A sly and thoughtful Sam Durant rummages through history
and pop culture for his inventive monuments at MOCA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first room of the Museum of Contemporary Art's concise and
winning survey of work by Sam Durant, a suite of six color
photographs from 1995 shows chairs tipped upside-down. Artlessly
composed, with haphazard cropping and the glare of a flash creating
hot spots and murky shadows in the prints, they look like tabloid
photographs taken at a crime scene -- Weegee without the people. The
chairs are surrogate victims.</LD>
<LD>   What's the crime? Most likely, the violent demise of Modernism.</LD>
<LD>   Each of Durant's tumbled-over chairs is distinctly modern in
design -- molded fiberglass, tubular steel, bent plywood, wire mesh
and other familiar materials from America's post-World War II
efflorescence of Better Living Through Modern Design. Each "victim"
is displayed with its front smashed into the floor, its legs up in
the air, its underside exposed. This fanny-first pose is weirdly
humiliating, as if some psycho serial killer had wickedly arranged
his corpses in the most embarrassing posture possible. Clearly, their
artless appearance has been carefully contrived.</LD>
<TE>   Durant has a sly and thoughtful manner, which slowly seeps through
the superficial simplicity of his work. He gets a lot out of a
little.</TE>
<TE>   Based in L.A., Durant might be seen as a second-generation "Helter
Skelter" artist. That was the title of a hugely influential 1992 MOCA
survey, which catapulted a dozen of the city's painters, sculptors
and installation artists to the forefront of international
consciousness. It also consolidated L.A.'s reputation as an art scene
of astonishing depth, breadth and resonance. Durant's work is
singularly inventive, but it builds on hybrid themes of aesthetics,
class, violence, entertainment and other aspects of American society
central to that show.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Kelley, whose potent collisions of working-class aesthetics,
rigorous high art and casual American mayhem were the pivot on which
"Helter Skelter" turned, is a clear source for Durant's work. So is
another, perhaps less-expected artist -- Robert Smithson, the New
Yorker whose Earthworks became a touchstone for American art in the
early 1970s. (Smithson died tragically young, at 35, in 1973.)</TE>
<TE>   Entropy is the Smithsonian mantra most evident in Durant's art.
The steady, inevitable degradation of mass and energy in the universe
to an ultimate state of inert uniformity is a heady concept. When
it's applied to something familiar from the kitchen, like a molded
plywood chair, it takes on a strange afterglow. If the universe is
running down like a clock that needs winding, Durant's art gives its
key several unexpected twists.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the first room of the MOCA show, which was ably organized
by curator Michael Darling, are the sculptures that first brought
Durant to critical attention. Called "Abandoned Houses" (1995), they
are homemade models of sleek domestic designs from L.A.'s famous --
and famously failed -- postwar Case Study experiment in modern
architecture for middle-class mass consumption.</TE>
<TE>   These are not the glamorous models produced by an architect's
office to wow the client. Instead they're a hobbyist's efforts, made
with cheap foam-core board, plexiglass, spray paint and tape, resting
on spindly tripod legs made from wooden dowels.</TE>
<TE>   None stands more than 3 1/2 feet tall. They demand that you look
down on them.</TE>
<TE>   They've also been trashed -- vandalized, marred by graffiti,
scattered with debris, stripped of their crystalline, utopian beauty.
A nearby group of 11 photocopied pictures of sleek Case Study House
interiors has likewise been violated, via elements of collage. The
high-minded abstractions of modern life are disrupted by the
stylistic transgression of a Chippendale chair, the class intrusion
of a lowly pine cabinet and the social misbehavior of beer-drinking
bikers.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the exhibition focuses on what could be called
monuments or memorials -- think Smithson's ironic monuments to
Passaic, N.J. (his childhood home), where rusted-out industrial sites
possess the historical gravity of ancient Greek temples. Durant's
monuments to his own youth (he was born in 1961) are installations
that fuse pop music and high art, social upheaval and arcane satire.
History becomes a malleable substance that can be reshaped, offering
unforeseen options for the future.</TE>
<TE>   Say "rock garden," for example, and Durant will blend the Zen
grace of a contemplative environment by Isamu Noguchi with the
raucous musical genre of 1970s Southern rock 'n' roll. Fake boulders
hide stereo speakers, while clustering around an institutional-style
trash can from a public park, a receptacle naturalized by a
decorative covering of pebbles.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors are invited to head over to the far end of the room to
the false front of a ramshackle cabin, complete with high-style
rockers on the front porch, and select records from plastic milk
crates to play in simultaneous opposition on dual turntables. (One
turntable plays the music backward.)</TE>
<TE>   The trash can in the center is a metaphorical pivot for the ash
heap of history, through which Durant and his audience gaily rummage.
Martha Graham's 1944 "Appalachian Spring" meets Lynyrd Skynyrd and
the Allman Brothers; Shaker simplicity collides with a Japanese
variety. You might not know that Noguchi designed the country cabin
set for Graham's ballet, but Durant's unexpected connections create a
sturdy platform for new experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Durant's best work has a distinctive tone of melancholic optimism.
Aggressive turmoil is fused with calm rationality. He fabricates
still moments of clarity when you're able to see the vortex of
contemporary culture spin in all its wild and terrible ferocity.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is that sensibility more in evidence than in a brand new
work, which is a highlight of the show. "Upside Down: Pastoral Scene"
is a memorial grove. A dozen fiberglass tree trunks are fused with
actual stumps, their tangled roots probing the space like Medusa's
hair. Each upended tree stump is set on a mirrored square, which
reflects it in an abstract space.</TE>
<TE>   The formal vocabulary is again Smithson's. But the syntax is pure
Durant. The subject of these reflected roots is African American
culture. Each stump is fitted with a speaker, from which a repertoire
of jazz, blues, soul, rap and other music emanates. When Billie
Holiday's "Strange Fruit" drifts from tree to tree, with its haunting
lyrics of the aftermath of the lynch mob, Durant's grove becomes a
killing field.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem unusual for a white American artist to make an
elegiac poem to black American culture -- but then, it isn't African
Americans who need to empathize with racism's brutality and cost.
That curious fact is integral to the power of "Upside Down: Pastoral
Scene."</TE>

<LD>LEWIS Segal's cogent, insightful review notwithstanding, not everyone
in attendance Saturday night appreciated or enjoyed Ballet
Preljocaj's unenlightened assault on Stravinsky's primitivist "Rite
of Spring" ("Preljocaj's Opposing Forces," Oct. 28).</LD>
<LD>   My female companions were appalled by the crude sexual violence
inflicted on the female dancers, not to mention the explicit
suggestion that the serial forcible couplings on display were the
inevitable (even expected) consequence of their initial teasing
overtures.</LD>
<LD>   Preljocaj may have hoped to avoid charges of sexism and
degradation of women by victimizing and humiliating the male dancers
as well, but the rape scenes, even though presented as "choreographic
abstractions," only re-asserted the male aggressive impulse that
continues to subjugate women.</LD>

<HD>The challenge of motherhood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IN regards to your Mothers' Bill of Rights article ("Mothers' Bill of
Rights: A Baby Step Toward Radical Goal," by Bettijane Levine, Oct.
29), I think it is naive to discuss mothers' rights without
considering poverty and the fear of poverty, as well as the
increasing number of hours Americans are being required to work to
keep their jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Most American families are precariously balanced and dependent on
two salaries to maintain the markers of middle-class status such as
homes and money for the children to go to college. Even in those
where the husband has a well-paid job -- say, a law professor at Yale
-- women are only a man away from poverty (in the words of Barbara
Ehrenreich [author of the book "Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By
in America"]).</LD>
<LD>   Seeing the incredible cruelty with which laws against "welfare
mothers" have been enacted would frighten any mother into staying in
the most lucrative job she can find.</LD>
<TE>   Those of us who don't have the option of creating our own
fulfilling part-time jobs, without regard to health insurance or
retirement plans, must struggle along putting dinner on the table and
checking the homework after a long work day.</TE>
<TE>   I hope the next conference on the topic addresses a fuller range
of issues that confine mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Dorf</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHAT I find absolutely amazing is how these educated women feel
diminished, in some way, because they choose to stay home with their
children. The need for personal validation should not be the nod of
approval from another being. Validation comes from within.</TE>
<TE>   Making the decision to stay home with your child(ren) is an
emotional and financial sacrifice. If you use your educational and
professional know-how, ask yourself this: Is my child worth it?
Without making any excuses, the answer you give to that question is
the only validation you need.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Saulnier</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIS article is one more example of the misplaced emphasis on the
role of mothers in our increasingly feminized society.</TE>
<TE>   It's not motherhood that needs shoring up, but fatherhood. Males
growing up without fathers are not surprisingly prone to gang
violence and other forms of tribal tests of manhood. Girls, too,
without a father figure in the house, suffer emotional deficits that
are not as obvious as boys' problems, but are real nevertheless.</TE>
<TE>   If the emotional health of our society is the goal, it is the
deteriorating role of fatherhood that needs looking at.</TE>

<LD>Cecil Beaton was no friend of Katharine Hepburn's, nor was he an

am, having produced her last three films and the very last scene she
ever performed in front of a motion picture camera (at a glowing 87
years old) in Truman Capote's "One Christmas."</LD>
<LD>   For the last 15 years I've had the profound pleasure of sharing my
life and work with this magnificent creature, whose graciousness,
kindness, generosity and boundless love of life buoyed my spirits in
the bleakest of times.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, Mr. Beaton, you never knew Katharine Hepburn, nor,
obviously, will you ever. Your remarks from the grave remain, as Mr.
Dickens would say, "Dead as a doornail."</LD>

<LD>HOW dare Patrick Goldstein agree with the ridiculous and offensive
behavior of CleanFlicks ("This Dad Demands Final Cut," Oct. 29).
What's worse is that he acts as if he is compelled to watch every
piece of trash that enters the media stream. Freedom of speech in
America means you can say anything you want -- and so can everyone
else. Being a thinking, rational, human being means you get to choose
whether you want to listen.</LD>
<LD>   And as for his epiphany: I'm sorry that instead of choosing to use
"The Lion King" to educate his child about the meaning of sacrifice
and death, Goldstein has, like so many others, simply "deleted" the
bad part. Oh, glorious editing, if only real life worked that way. We
could edit out the sniper ... and the Russian hostages ... and Iraq
... and, while we're at it, why not 9/11?</LD>

<TE>   GOLDSTEIN'S point is valid, if only the entertainment industry
behemoths that control what we are offered as consumers take a varied
approach that benefits all consumers. Choice is indeed the byword
here. I'd regret to see all of our entertainment choices dictated by
children or, by proxy, their parents. Parents also have a
responsibility to not show every film to their children, no matter
how pleasantly truncated by technology the result may be.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>MANOHLA Dargis' review of the stagy "Frida" was spot on ("A Portrait
of 'Frida' That's All in the Framing," Oct. 25). Frida Kahlo was
obviously more interesting than we are being shown in this
melodramatic telenovela of a film more appropriately titled
"Treinta-something."</LD>
<LD>   I could have easily watched Julie Taymor's stunning
representations of Kahlo's work and madness for two hours, because
there's nothing beautiful about its weak attempt at portraying her
emotions.</LD>
<LD>   Greg Reeves</LD>
<TE>   Westwood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I think Dargis expects to see the pain that Kahlo captured on
canvas reproduced on Salma Hayek's face: "The best Hayek can do with
her lovely face is cloud it with worry, but the face of Frida Kahlo
demands anguish."</TE>
<TE>   More anguish in the acting? Look at the paintings; the anguish is
there.</TE>
<TE>   What the movie depicts is the complexity of a woman who sought to
love and be loved, whose outer life was lavish and lonely, and whose
politics were radical and leftist.</TE>
<TE>   For director Taymor's beautiful interpretation of Kahlo's life, go
see the film; don't be deterred by Dargis' unfulfilled expectations.
For the pain and the anguish -- both inner and outer -- go to the
paintings.</TE>

<HD>Sexual harassment suit roils lesbian industry group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Power Up, a network of gay women in the entertainment industry, burst
upon the scene two years ago with a mission to promote the visibility
of lesbians in the media and a commitment to change the "old boy's
club" way of doing things in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   But as the nonprofit group prepares for its second annual
fund-raiser -- a gala in Beverly Hills on Sunday night honoring
singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge, Showtime Networks' Jerry Offsay
and this year's "Top 10 gay women in showbiz" -- the organization
finds itself embroiled in a sexual harassment dispute involving two
of its co-founders.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Power Up
co-founder and onetime publicist Karen Pearson Brown has accused
executive director and co-founder Stacy Codikow of making unwanted
sexual overtures and sexually offensive comments, e-mailing her a
lewd photograph, inquiring about the sex life of Brown and her
partner, and demanding Brown's resignation after learning Brown was
bisexual.</LD>
<TE>   "You cannot be a founder of Power Up if you are with men," Codikow
told Brown, according to the suit. "This is a lesbian organization."</TE>
<TE>   Brown left the organization and filed suit last year, and Codikow
has since fired back in legal briefs, alleging that it was Brown who
made unwanted sexual overtures and that she twice removed her clothes
at Codikow's home in a failed attempt at seduction.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's "tawdry allegations are completely false," Codikow said in
a statement released Friday by her publicist. "It is truly
regrettable that Pearson [Brown] is abusing the legal system and
civil rights laws by trying to extract money from a nonprofit
organization."</TE>
<TE>   In August, Codikow filed a countersuit saying Brown has defamed
her by spreading false claims that she had embezzled $38,000 from
Power Up and used the nonprofit's money for personal purposes. Both
cases are in the discovery phase, and both women have denied doing
anything improper.</TE>
<TE>   Each has her defenders in Hollywood's lesbian community.</TE>
<TE>   Jehan Agrama, who co-chaired the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation's Media Awards for 11 years and is now a member of Power
Up's honorary board of directors, calls Brown's charges "laughable."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine [Codikow] jeopardizing [Power Up] or doing
anything like that," she said. "It's just not who she is."</TE>
<TE>   But Marjorie Mann, a freelance production manager for television
and live events and a former Power Up member, said Codikow's
countercharges are implausible.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way that Pearson [Brown] would be remotely interested
[in having sex with Codikow]," she said, adding that Brown is
"extremely professional."</TE>
<TE>   With offices in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, Power Up -- the
Professional Organization of Women in Entertainment Reaching Up --
has between 500 and 700 members, gay and straight, nationwide. It has
bankrolled short films by its members, has held industry workshops
and provides a resume bank for Hollywood filmmakers looking for
talent.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Power Up received wide media coverage when it released
a list ranking the Top 10 most powerful gay women in show business
that included comedian Ellen DeGeneres, Etheridge, singer k.d. lang
and director Kimberly Peirce ("Boys Don't Cry").</TE>
<TE>   Its honorary board of directors includes such entertainment
figures as Jan Oxenberg, producer of the TV series "Once and Again,"
Lee Rose, writer-director of "The Truth About Jane," Marcus Hu,
co-president of Strand Releasing, Andrea Sperling, producer of
"Pumpkin," and Jamie Babbit, writer-director of "But I'm a
Cheerleader."</TE>
<TE>   The first salvo in the legal skirmish was fired last fall, when
Brown's Century City attorney, Craig T. Byrnes, filed suit against
Power Up, Codikow and her production company, Codikow Films, alleging
sexual harassment, defamation and infliction of emotional distress.</TE>
<TE>   Among the allegations contained in Brown's suit:</TE>
<TE>   * On Oct. 12, 2000, Brown attended a dinner with Codikow and
others to discuss the promotion of Power Up. Codikow allegedly asked
Brown, "So, are we going to have sex? What are my chances on scale of
one to 10?" Brown said she replied, "I'm not going to answer that. We
are business partners."</TE>
<TE>   * That same month, Codikow invited Brown and her girlfriend to her
house for dinner, which was also attended by Codikow's bookkeeper,
Kevin Vermillion."After dinner, Codikow began asking Brown and
Brown's girlfriend personal questions about their sex life,"
including "Do you like to watch?" the suit states.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, according to the suit, Codikow e-mailed Brown a
picture of a man masturbating.</TE>
<TE>   * In July 2001, Codikow invited Brown and Vermillion to get ice
cream during work one day. The suit states that Codikow and
Vermillion then started talking about "hooker parties" they had
thrown and described sexual acts they had performed on prostitutes.
Brown said she told them, "This conversation is making me sick," but
they continued talking about sexual acts with prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   Vermillion has filed a sworn declaration denying that he ever
discussed "hooker parties" with Codikow and Brown. He also denied
ever going out for ice cream with the two women.</TE>
<TE>   * In July or August of 2001, Brown was having lunch in the Power
Up board room with Codikow and a talent manager named Alan who had a
nearby office, when Codikow allegedly said: "Hey, Pearson wants a
baby. Why don't you and Alan [engage in intercourse]?" Brown said she
became upset and embarrassed and replied, "That's sexual harassment,
Stacy. You are creating a hostile environment."</TE>
<TE>   According to Brown's suit, the situation exploded in August 2001,
when Codikow asked her out but was rebuffed; Brown said she had a
date with a man.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, "I never discussed with her that I had been married,"
said Brown, 39, in an interview. "I was with the same man for about
12 years."</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Brown said she arrived at the office and found
Codikow and the organization's other co-founder, Amy Shomer, waiting
for her and demanding that she sign resignation papers.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'I want to leave this office now,' " Brown recalled in
the interview. "[Codikow] said, 'You're not going until you sign
that.' "</TE>
<TE>   In legal briefs, Codikow's attorney, Jeffrey F. Webb, branded
Brown's lawsuit "utterly frivolous."</TE>
<TE>   Webb also filed an appeal trying to get the suit tossed out using
the novel argument that Brown's suit infringed on Codikow's right to
free speech under California's anti-SLAPP law (Strategic Lawsuits
Against Public Participation). The 2nd District Court of Appeal
recently rejected the argument and trial remains months off.</TE>
<TE>   A key legal question is whether Brown was an employee of Power Up.
Codikow, 39, has maintained that Power Up has no employees, only
volunteers, and that Brown merely worked as a volunteer during her
tenure with the group.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Codikow claims in a sworn declaration that she never
sexually harassed Brown, never made overtures of a sexual nature to
Brown and never created a sexually hostile environment.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Ms. Brown who engaged in conduct of a sexual nature,"
Codikow said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Codikow said, Brown once sent her a picture in which
Brown was on a bed wearing a negligee. And "on two separate occasions
while Ms. Brown was visiting at my house, Ms. Brown took off all her
clothes and stood naked in front of me" in a failed attempt at
seduction.</TE>
<TE>   In a sworn declaration, Shomer said she received a call from
Codikow, who "told me that Ms. Brown had just taken off all of her
clothes and was running around naked in front of her. Ms. Codikow was
very upset and said, 'Help me. What do I do?' I told Ms. Codikow to
lock the door of her bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   Shomer also states that in August 2001, after Codikow told Brown
her services at Power Up were no longer needed, Brown became angry
and said to her, "There will be no Power Up if I can't be part of it.
I will destroy it." She then turned to Codikow and said, "I will take
you down."</TE>
<TE>   Brown has denied the allegations.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two-time Academy Award-winning actor Robert De Niro was named Friday
to receive the 31st American Film Institute Life Achievement Award.</LD>
<LD>   "Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors of his generation,"
said Howard Stringer, chairman of the AFI board of trustees. "In a
career that includes over 60 motion pictures, De Niro's sense of
commitment to the character -- both mentally and physically -- has
changed the way we look at an actor's contribution to the art form."</LD>
<LD>   De Niro, 59, made his screen debut in Brian De Palma's 1968
"Greetings" and won his first Oscar -- for supporting actor -- as the
young Don Corleone in 1974's "The Godfather, Part II." He received
the best actor award six years later for his performance as prize
fighter Jake La Motta in Martin Scorsese's "Raging Bull."</LD>
<TE>   De Niro will be given the award at a tribute on June 12 at the
Kodak Theatre in Hollywood. The event will be telecast at a later
date on USA Network.</TE>

<HD>Lingerie special to air even earlier</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite controversy related to last year's telecast, CBS has
rescheduled its Nov. 20 telecast of this year's "Victoria's Secret
Fashion Show" from 10 p.m. to 8 p.m., the network announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The 2001 version of the lingerie special was broadcast at 9 p.m.
on ABC and prompted complaints to the Federal Communications
Commission, which ruled in March that "it does not appear we have any
basis for action."</LD>
<LD>   Some parents groups and legislators felt the program was too
revealing, yet CBS is airing this year's edition at an earlier hour,
when more children are apt to be watching television. Last year's
program drew an estimated 12.4 million viewers and, like the upcoming
one, was scheduled during the November rating sweeps.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody's going to know in advance what it is and what it's
going to be about," said Jack Sussman, the CBS executive in charge of
specials, regarding the propriety of the scheduling shift, which
figures to provide a stronger lead-in audience to CBS' struggling
"The Amazing Race." At a news conference this summer, CBS Television
President Les Moonves said the decision to pick up the show
demonstrated the network was "not your grandmother's CBS."</TE>

<HD>Howard Stern as movie producer</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio talk show host Howard Stern told listeners Friday that he's
expanding his media reach in a new direction. After writing books,
starring in an autobiographical movie and producing a TV series --
all while continuing to preside over a nationally syndicated radio
program that also is excerpted on cable TV -- Stern is turning movie
producer.</LD>
<LD>   His first project will be a remake of the 1981 teen comedy
"Porky's," to be followed by a remake of the 1979 teen musical "Rock
'n' Roll High School." Stern will serve as executive producer with
former Dimension Films executive Dan Gross under the latter's newly
formed Arclight Films.</LD>
<LD>   In a news release, Stern said that producing the films would give
him "the opportunity to bring more stupidity and childishness to a
whole new generation -- and that thrills me!"</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Halloween is meant to be spent with the undead, so what better place
to be than the Rolling Stones show at Staples Center?</LD>
<LD>   Inside the arena, there were zombies, ghouls and half-rotted
corpses. But enough about Keith Richards. Some folks in the audience
looked a little creaky too.</LD>
<LD>   (OK, maybe one more thing about Richards. Every time the Stones
announce another tour, late-night comics have a field day riffing on
the band's age. In 1997, David Letterman's writers devised a top 10
list of rejected tour names, including "Rolling Stones Live Plus
Keith Richards" and "Come see what Hanson will look like in the year
2097." More recently, Jay Leno played mock concert footage in which
fans, instead of throwing lingerie at Richards, tossed Depends.)</LD>
<TE>   But on Thursday, age was no deterrent to the band's loyal
followers, some of whom began attending Stones concerts in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Myers, a scraggly bearded 52-year-old from Camarillo who saw
his first show in 1964, said wild horses couldn't drag him away from
this one. "If I had to come in on a stretcher or a wheelchair, I
would," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, prices are steeper now, proving the old adage that you
can't always get what you want, but if you pay a scalper $365, you
get what you need.</TE>
<TE>   A few fans came with mixed emotions. Retired car dealer Don Kott,
71, who originally saw the band in 1972 and fell asleep midway
through the show (he was overwhelmed by the volume and the "funny
smoke" in the stands), decided to try again, but only because his
wife is a huge fan. "I figured if I brought earplugs and took a
couple of Advils before the show, I'd survive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Lewis, 74, who also saw the Stones only one other time,
decided to catch this gig because he wasn't sure whether the band
would ever tour again. This could be the last time, this could be the
last time, maybe the last time, he don't know.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who said he booked the Stones' first U.S. appearance in the
early 1960s at the Swing Auditorium in San Bernardino, never dreamed
back then that the group would still be playing four decades later.
"My business partner and I were doing sporting events at the time,"
he recalled. "My partner said rock 'n' roll would last one year. The
first show we did was Creedence Clearwater Revival. When I saw them
perform, I told him, 'They're good.' So he said, 'OK, maybe they'll
be around two years.' "</TE>
<TE>   For longtime fans, the lyrics don't necessarily carry the same
meaning they did several decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ketcher, 50, said his favorite "mother's little helper" in the
1960s was LSD. And now? "Iced tea," he confessed. "I quit drinking
about five years ago. That had to become part of the past."</TE>
<TE>   Another 50-ish gent who identified himself only as "the
commissioner" said: "The lyrics are the same, but you can interpret
them any way you want. There will always be a honky-tonk woman."</TE>
<TE>   Some wags have suggested that the Stones revamp their hits to be
more in tune with aging baby-boomers. A few years ago, Chris Willman
of Entertainment Weekly came up with a set list that included
"Angie-oplasty," "It's Only Geritol (But I Like It)," "Harlem
Shuffleboard," "(I Can't Get No) Wheelchair Traction," "Sympathy for
Wilford Brimley," "Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Pacemaker)" and "Dye It
Black" (sample lyric: "I see a gray hair and I want to dye it
black").</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was a Stones veteran. Christina Moore, 15, of Los
Angeles said the band appeals to all generations. "They're timeless,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe. Although Mick Jagger, 59, looked pretty spry,
strutting around the stage like a chicken on amphetamines, time isn't
necessarily on his side. There was something vaguely suspicious about
his hair, which remained mysteriously sweat-free despite two hours of
virtually nonstop gyrating and prancing. Guitarist Ron Wood's mane
also appeared unusually dry.</TE>
<TE>   Could the Stones be wearing toupees?</TE>
<TE>   What a drag it is getting old.</TE>

<HD>NEA nominee puts poetry back on Page 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Rutten</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dana Gioia, who is President Bush's candidate to lead the National
Endowment for the Arts over the next four years, once posed the
question "Can poetry matter?" If the flurry of interest that has
arisen since the 51-year-old Santa Rosa poet and critic's name was
first floated last week is any indication, the answer is emphatically
yes.</LD>
<LD>   Every story on his impending nomination has included this set of
facts: Gioia is the Hawthorne-raised son of hard-working parents --
Dad a cabby, Mom a soda fountain attendant. He earned advanced
degrees from Harvard and Stanford before pursuing a successful
business career -- he oversaw Kool-Aid for General Foods -- which he
threw over for life as a poet and critic. In a controversial 1991
essay, he argued convincingly that contemporary poetry needs to be
rescued from the deadly grip of academe.</LD>
<LD>   And, finally, he is the maker of an equally controversial remark
about Los Angeles. This is, Gioia said, "perhaps the only great city
in the world that has not yet produced a great poet, a poet who
captures the spirit of the place," as Walt Whitman did for New York
and Baudelaire for Paris.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking by telephone this week from Chattanooga, Tenn., where
rehearsals are underway for "Nosferatu," an opera for which he wrote
the libretto, Gioia stood by his assessment. He was quick to point
out, though, that he never said that great poems had not been written
in Los Angeles nor that great experiences of poetry have not occurred
here.</TE>
<TE>   "The first live poetry reading I ever attended," he recalled, "was
at the Mark Taper Forum, where I heard Kenneth Rexroth read his
translations of Chinese poetry accompanied by classical Chinese
music. It was an unforgettable experience."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, with his nomination still pending, Gioia said he is
reluctant to amplify his thought about Los Angeles. As the recent
controversies surrounding Quincy Troupe and Amiri Baraka have shown,
poetry and politics can be uneasy bedfellows.</TE>
<TE>   So how should Los Angeles plead to the charge of lacking an
unchallenged bardic voice? Guilty with an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   The explanation should begin with a question: Why is it that alone
among the world's great cities, Los Angeles lacks a single inarguably
distinguished public building -- the jury is still out on Frank
Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall and Jose Rafael Moneo's new
cathedral -- but is the largest repository of great domestic
architecture?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is that this is overwhelmingly a city of private life.
The great bourgeois conception that private life is meaningful has
reached its apogee -- or decadence -- here on the shore of the
Pacific. Our great spaces are private not public ones; our major
preoccupations are individual and familial rather than communal. And
just as these facts subsume common social and political expectations,
so they frustrate the expectation that a great city must inevitably
have a single, great poet.</TE>
<TE>   "In the strict Whitmanesque-sense, Gioia is correct," said David
L. Ulin, who has edited anthologies of Los Angeles' literature.
"There is no poet who has made a career singing the song of the city,
but I would argue that L.A. is a special case because it doesn't have
a cohesive civic identity or central narrative in the sense that New
York does. L.A. is a chaotic collage of cultures and people and,
therefore, unique."</TE>
<TE>   Ulin said that while he is not a big fan of Charles Bukowski,
L.A.'s bestselling poet, "he wrote some great stuff. I think, though,
that Wanda Coleman more often takes on the issues of the city. I
think Eloise Klein Healy and Aleida Rodriguez are both wonderful, but
theirs is a very personal poetry. The dislocation that is a fact of
life here works against any other type."</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area poet and critic Jack Foley, host of the influential
"Cover to Cover" program on Berkeley radio station KPFA, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go down to Los Angeles to do a poetry reading, people come
up to me afterward and say, 'That was very nice. Do you have a film
script?' In L.A., serious thinking and writing goes into films and
novels. Bukowski and other important poets there are systematic
outsiders and, in a certain sense, small-towners. Bukowski was much
more inclined to write about San Pedro or Hollywood the neighborhood.
Venice Beach is a constant presence in the work of Stuart Perkoff,
who is a poet I admire very much. Neither is interested in the city
as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   Gioia's appraisal of Los Angeles' poetry came during a debate
that's been going since the publication in 2000 of another of his
controversially plain-spoken critical essays in which he decried the
mediocrity of so much contemporary California poetry. "Lacking a
vital critical milieu, well-intentioned regional literati usually
practice boosterism," Gioia wrote. That, he argued, is "a slow poison
to native excellence."</TE>
<TE>   Much invective ensued. "Arrogant" and "elitist" were two of the
lesser epithets tossed Gioia's way. Somehow, though, they are hard to
reconcile with the description of himself that Gioia offers in an
unpublished essay titled "On Being a California Poet":</TE>
<TE>   "I was born and raised in Hawthorne, Calif., a tough working-class
town in southwest Los Angeles. Hawthorne was also my mother's
hometown. Her mestizo father had fled his reservation in New Mexico
to settle on the West Coast. My father's family had immigrated from
Sicily at the turn of the century. Surrounded by Italian-speaking
relations, I grew up in a neighborhood populated mostly by Mexicans
and Dust Bowl Okies.</TE>
<TE>   "I attended Catholic schools at a time when Latin was still a
living ritual language. I went to Junipero Serra High School, a
Catholic boys school run by the French Marianist order -- many of
whom were Hawaiian, Chinese or Mexican. The school was located in
Gardena, where Buddhist temples outnumbered mainstream Protestant
churches. Having experienced this extraordinary linguistic and
cultural milieu, I have never given credence to Easterners who
prattle about the intellectual vacuity of Southern California. My
childhood was a rich mixture of European, Latino, Indian, Asian and
North American culture in which everything from Hollywood to the
Vatican, Buddha to the Beach Boys had its place.</TE>
<TE>   " ... I believe that it is essential for some writers to maintain
their regional affinities. To speak from a particular place and time
is not provincialism, but part of a writer's identity. It is my
pleasure and my challenge to speak from California."</TE>
<TE>   So he has, and excellently so. It will be more than refreshing to
see the NEA directed at last by someone who understands the wisdom of
poet Patrick Kavanagh's dictum: While the best art often is
parochial, it never is provincial.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oct. 19 Counterpunch, in which writer J.F. Lawton attacked me and
the Writers Guild's credits committee (of which I am the
co-chairman), was worrisome. Someone unfamiliar with the issues might
not realize that his piece is riddled with false assumptions,
misinformation and spurious analogy.</LD>
<LD>   Lawton's argument (for which The Times provided the sadly
misleading headline "Writers Guild Policies Ensure It's a Union
Divided Against Itself") begins with an undeniable fact: The movie
industry hires screenwriters and then, very often, hires other
screenwriters to rewrite them. This state of affairs is painful to
writers and bad for movies in general, but does it divide our union
against itself? No. What divides the union is people who, like
Lawton, blame the situation not on the industry, but on other writers
-- and, of all things, on a set of credits proposals that haven't
even been passed yet. The logic here is very odd. The situation is
terrible, Lawton says, so please let's not change anything to make it
more equitable.</LD>
<TE>   Lawton argues that our union is already divided: into struggling,
inexperienced "first writers" and the established, power-hungry fat
cats who rewrite them. You're either one or the other, he claims. But
is there any truth in what he says? Well, let's see. My first film
was "Lolita," the 1998 version that starred Jeremy Irons. I was paid
union scale for it, and the people I was rewriting were Harold Pinter
and David Mamet. Now I've become better known, and on my last four
projects I have been the first writer. So which group do I belong to?
Or is it possible that, in the interests of fomenting a mini-class
struggle within what has recently been a superbly united union,
Lawton is creating divisions where none actually exist?</TE>
<TE>   In any case, he isn't really making sense. Lawton says that the
troubles he talks about are the province of the movie business. He
holds up TV as an example of the way things should be. "Imagine, in
television," he says, "if David E. Kelley were brought in to rewrite
Aaron Sorkin's idea for a new show and then David Chase were brought
in to rewrite that." But wait a minute. Sorkin is an experienced,
highly paid writer-producer -- hardly analogous to the struggling
first writer Lawton claims to champion. No, Kelley's not about to
rewrite him. But do Sorkin and others in his position rewrite less
experienced, less well-paid writers? Only every day, every week,
every month. People who don't know how the system works are likely to
think that Lawton's pseudo-reasoning sounds logical, but it has
nothing to do with reality.</TE>
<TE>   Let's talk about reality. In reality, all TV shows are budgeted
for rewriting, even more than movies are. In reality, more movies are
written by a single writer (or team) than aren't. In reality,
experienced writers don't alter things in a previous script just to
ensure credit, because experienced writers know better. We're all
working too hard to get the script right so that we can get our movie
made. Would anybody in his right mind change a screenplay for the
worse just to fool credit arbiters? Why get yourself fired? And if
you do make a substantial contribution to what's on the screen ...
well, guess what? I think you should get credit for it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the intent of the guild's rational, modest and carefully
thought out proposals is simply to give credit where credit is due
and to clarify the sometimes murky existing rules. Period. Lawton and
his followers have turned these proposals into bogeymen onto which
they can project all their frustration over what is admittedly a
pretty frustrating system.</TE>
<TE>   But the proposals have nothing to do with that system. Frankly,
our credits rules have nothing to do with that system. If they do,
all the more reason to reform them, because they're certainly not
making the system as it is any better.</TE>
<TE>   But let's get serious. Does anyone in his right mind think that a
studio executive who's about to fire one writer and hire another will
pause because of an obscure clause in the WGA Credits Manual? Please.
It's simply naive to think that we can change studio behavior by
sabotaging this honest effort to reform the biases and confusions in
our credits rules.</TE>
<TE>   The passion that goes into negative campaigning is often more
persuasive than truth. And the paranoia and distortion that have been
injected into this debate have harmed our union more than any other
single development in years. Lawton and his cronies should be ashamed
of themselves.</TE>

<HD>A menu from facials to desserts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whose idea of relaxation was lemon water anyway? There's a new pamper
palace in town, and this one has creme brulee on the menu. Christine
Splichal, partners with her chef husband, Joachim, in the landmark
L.A. restaurant Patina, opened a spa this week on Robertson Boulevard
in West Hollywood with her friend Olga Lorencin, a facialist who
worked at Ole Henriksen for 13 years.</LD>
<LD>   Kinara is an intimate spot, in stark contrast to the sterile,
windowless environments that make some large spas seem more like
facial and massage factories than relaxing retreats.</LD>
<LD>   Splichal and Lorencin brainstormed the idea for Kinara last year
after Lorencin's wedding in Maui. "We were sitting on the beach,"
Splichal said. "She said that her dream was to have her own place and
asked for my help. ... I thought about it and decided that the spa
business was not so different from the restaurant business. Both are
about people and good service."</LD>
<TE>   Soon after, Splichal, who is from Biarritz, France, and Lorencin,
who is from Belgrade, Yugoslavia, toured spas in the U.S. and abroad.
They went to Canyon Ranch and the Sedona Spa in Arizona and to the
Sources de Caudalie, a spa in the Bordeaux region of France that
specializes in grape-seed treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, they decided to create a day spa with the luxurious
elements of a destination spa, a place where everything -- from the
food to the tabletops, the treatments to the bath towels -- is
indulgent. Splichal says, "A spa should be an all-encompassing
experience. And people are longing for something small, private and
boutique-y."</TE>
<TE>   Designed by architect Hagy Belzberg, who did the Patina, Nick &amp;
Stef's Steakhouse and Moomba restaurants, the 4,500-square-foot
wood-and-glass building decorated in warm earth tones is as inviting
as a private bungalow. Frosted and clear glass windows allow natural
light to pour in. Spa-goers have a view of the leafy street as they
sit on couches with Etro cushions, and dip their toes into rose
petal-filled pedicure basins.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Splichal has incorporated a restaurant into the mix,
although the food is neither low-fat nor low-cal. For spa visitors
only, it has a seasonal organic menu designed by her husband that
might include homemade granola with a fruit compote, chilled cucumber
and tomato soup, and mascarpone cheese served with berry coulis.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea is to treat yourself with the best of everything,"
Splichal said.</TE>
<TE>   A boutique offers artisanal objects from around the world. There
are hand-embroidered cotton pajamas from Vietnam ($80); semiprecious
stone bracelets from France (about $300); "crinkled" ceramic cups
from Holland ($6); and pointy-toed silk "babouche" slippers from
Morocco ($48). "They are all the rage in Paris right now," Splichal
said of the open-back slippers. "Men are wearing them with suits."</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, there are five private rooms, where treatments include a
"thirsty skin quencher facial" ($110) that uses a three-layer mask;
an "ache breaker" hydrotherapy bath ($50) with peppermint, juniper
and eucalyptus to sooth sore muscles; a chamomile-honey body scrub
($100); and two-hour Thai massages ($150).</TE>
<TE>   A day before the spa opened on Tuesday, Lorencin showed off her
utility room, where she concocts scrubs and massage oils from honey,
aloe, green tea and other ingredients. She also demonstrated how to
incorporate aromatherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Kinara has a small skin-care line, including a green-apple
cleansing gel and a lemon eucalyptus hydrator, but it also stocks
selected items from Dermed, Ayer-medic and Hormeta. "I never buy an
entire line of products," Lorencin explained. "I like to pick and
choose." Products are arranged for sale according to skin type. "It
doesn't matter if it's French, Italian or local," she says. "I bring
it here and make it easy."</TE>

<HD>Inland Pacific Ballet: bloodless 'Dracula'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nestled between its Balanchine programs, which end this weekend in
Bridges Auditorium at the Claremont Colleges, Inland Pacific Ballet
ventured a new dance version of "Dracula." Like other companies
trying to balleticize the nocturnal Transylvanian, IPB stumbled
badly.</LD>
<LD>   Choreographed in nine scenes by Arturo Fernandez, ballet master
for Alonzo King's San Francisco-based Lines Ballet, this hourlong
version is weak in characterization and choreographic invention. It
also taxed the 10-year-old company/school, especially the male
dancers.</LD>
<LD>   The length might suggest a kid's ballet (there were children in
Halloween costumes at the Thursday performance), but the dead body
carried on stage at the end of the first scene, not to mention
drooling female vampires feasting on two men later, suggested a
different world.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, there was something simplistic about
Fernandez's failure to create real characters. John Harker (Tyrone
Baker) and Dr. Seward (Joseph Villalobos) danced identical steps at
their first appearance and there was no way of telling them apart.
Ditto their fiancees, Mina Murray (Allynne Stoller), Dracula's next
victim, and Lucy Westenra (Laura de Guia).</TE>
<TE>   Dracula (Steven Voznick) didn't do much actual dancing. He posed
and furled his cape and looked fitfully agonized, manipulative or
cold. His contingent of undead brides derived their movements, as did
all the others, from a mix of academic steps and modern-dance
contortions.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody, however, seemed to be dancing out of real need or impulse.
The low point was Mina's sickroom scene, where each person took a few
steps, then danced an overwrought solo for no apparent reason except
that this was a ballet.</TE>
<TE>   The recorded score (Saint-Saens, Prokofiev, Mussorgsky and
others), which included wolf calls and other horror film standards,
was compiled by Scott Fraser and company director Victoria Koenig.
Liz Stillwell lighted Nancy Seruto's resourceful, budget scenic
design effectively.</TE>

<HD>A naughty Halloween, spooky and interactive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gina Piccalo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Michael Bay and his stunner girlfriend Lisa Dergan worked
their way through the crushing, costumed crowd -- a human nightstand,
a flock of French maids, a towering Anna Nicole Smith -- to a series
of "interactive rooms" where scantily clad porn actors entertained
passers-by with suggestive antics.</LD>
<LD>   Out in the back parking lot, the Lakers' Rick Fox (as Santa
Claus), hip-hop artist Shaggy (as himself) and Tori Spelling (as a
genie?) mingled among hundreds more as several naked women dazzled
the crowd from a small stage.</LD>
<LD>   The Halloween party in West Hollywood, a 1,000-strong affair with
a modest budget of about $35,000, was a group effort, funded by adult
film giant Vivid Video Inc. and co-hosted by hotel heiress Paris
Hilton, Flaunt magazine and Pony sportswear. It brought out a motley
mass of actors, writers, rock star progeny (Jack Osbourne and Ahmet
Zappa) and exotic dancers.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the only party where the porn stars dress like lawyers,"
said guest Josh Etting, a writer for the WB's "The Jamie Kennedy
Experiment."</TE>
<TE>   Bay, himself an experienced partygoer, was trying to make sense of
it all. "What is this place?" he asked. "We've been walking around
for the last 10 minutes trying to figure out whose party this is!"
Dergan nodded furiously, her eyes wide.</TE>
<TE>   The event was held at the Live Acts Video Inc. building on Beverly
Boulevard, a two-story place with blank white walls where couples
rent out theme rooms (a dentist's office, a barn, a psychedelic
lounge, a Pottery Barn bedroom) to create their own videos.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular room on Thursday night was the dungeon, where an
enormous bare-chested man flogged a blindfolded, topless woman. With
each strike, voyeur Tori Spelling cringed and then giggled.</TE>
<TE>   In a hallway, a young man in a salt-and-pepper wig and smoking
jacket, presumably impersonating Hugh Hefner, headed outside.
Unbeknownst to him, the real Hugh Hefner appeared right behind him,
trailing a conga line of blonds.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, back in the parking lot, a man with slicked back hair,
a black leather jacket and eyeliner stood smoking a cigarette with
cinematic grace.</TE>
<TE>   "Excuse me," said a woman standing nearby. "You look remarkably
like Mickey Rourke."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," he said, taking another drag, "I am.... I was wearing a
costume, but it just got too hot."</TE>
<TE>   Producer Bryan Rucks, wearing a bright yellow suit jacket over a
plastic skeleton suit, shouted out to a slim young woman wearing a
black cat suit: "Are you Spider Woman?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm your worst nightmare," she answered, squeezing past a human
deviled egg.</TE>

<HD>Unearthing celebrity profiles that aged well</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Sachs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someday, the Hollywood power brokers who reign over TV programming
will wake up to discover that the cult of celebrity is over, and that
the public has finally had its fill of the endless profiles of the
rich and famous that have been clogging the airwaves since the medium
was in its infancy.</LD>
<LD>   That day is nowhere in sight, of course, and so, armed with that
knowledge, the folks at the TV Land cable channel are trotting out a
new series that will air for the next 14 Sundays and, if the ratings
are decent, maybe longer.</LD>
<LD>   The "new" tag comes with an asterisk, because the show, "TV Land
Legends: The 60 Minutes Interviews," is actually composed of
one-on-one chats culled from the archives of the long-running CBS
newsmagazine. But although you might be thinking that the quality
will be more like leftover turkey loaf than the real bird, the
half-hour shows play surprisingly well. In fact, some of the older
episodes feel fresher and more interesting than more recent
interviews.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday's special two-hour block of four episodes, for example,
opens at 9 p.m. with Morley Safer's fascinating 1984 chat with Jackie
Gleason that serves as a welcome reminder of the late legend's talent
and zest for life, while the last of the segments, Steve Kroft's 1997
interview with Jerry Seinfeld (10:30 p.m.), covers what now seems
like overly familiar territory.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Mike Wallace's tough, probing 1979 interview with
Johnny Carson (9:30) is a winner, rendering Wallace's '99 puff piece
on Carol Burnett (10 p.m.) pale by comparison.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Bradley is the host of the series and offers updated
perspectives on the segments, which include some footage that hasn't
been seen. Single episodes will begin airing Nov. 10 at 10 p.m. with
Robin Williams in the hot seat.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty minutes of classic "60 Minutes" interviews isn't half bad,
and more often than not, quite good.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Auto Sales Figures Continue to Lose Steam</HD>
<DH>Foreign manufacturers also report sharp drops but fare
better than the Big Three. The declines are linked to economic and
war concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. sales of new passenger cars and light trucks fell sharply for a
second straight month in October as manufacturers, facing a tough
comparison with a record month last year and diminishing returns from
incentives, joined in a downhill race.</LD>
<LD>   As usual, foreign-based automakers fared somewhat better than
their rivals in Detroit in the monthly results posted Friday. But
sales dropped precipitously for just about everyone, amid growing
concerns about the economy, joblessness and a possible war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the world's two largest
automakers, said their October sales plunged 32% and 34.9%,
respectively.</LD>
<TE>   The results, which exclude GM and Ford's foreign auto brands,
compared with a blowout month in October last year, when industrywide
sales hit a record high.</TE>
<TE>   Their Big Three rival Chrysler Group, an arm of DaimlerChrysler,
said its October sales fell 31%.</TE>
<TE>   Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker, said its U.S. sales
slumped 19.4% in October.</TE>
<TE>   Among Japanese automakers, Honda Motor Co. held up the best, with
an October sales decline of 5.8%. But Toyota Motor Corp. said its
U.S. sales dropped 21%, and Nissan Motor Co. said sales at its core
Nissan division in North America fell 12.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The drop in sales at Nissan was partly the result of last month's
lockout of dockworkers on the West Coast, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bill Kirrane, regional director for the Nissan division in
Carson, said declining sales were also caused by the recent fall in
U.S. consumer confidence, which hit a nine-year low last month.</TE>
<TE>   Automakers have been able to keep buyers streaming into showrooms
by offering interest-free loans, cash rebates and other incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Incentives declined in September, however, from a peak in July and
August, when sales hit an annual rate of 18.7 million vehicles. That
earlier burst may have pulled forward sales from September and
October.</TE>

<HD>Cigna Tells of Probe by SEC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cigna Corp., the nation's third-largest health insurer, reported
Friday an $887-million loss for the third quarter and said the
Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an informal inquiry
into the firm. The company said it will cooperate fully with the SEC
probe. Cigna said it learned of the investigation a few days ago, but
gave no details of what regulators were examining.</LD>
<LD>   "Given the market reaction last week, we don't think it was
unexpected," said company spokesman Wendell Potter.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the company disclosed that a pricing miscalculation in
its health-care division would sharply reduce profit. The
announcement caused Cigna's stock to lose nearly 40% of its value.</LD>
<TE>   In a bid to remain competitive and retain dissatisfied customers,
Cigna last year had offered some clients deep price discounts that
the company could not afford, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Cigna's loss reported Friday amounted to $6.27 a share for the
July-September quarter, including one-time charges of $1.04 billion.
It earned $270 million, or $1.81 a share, for the same period last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said investors should be
careful about Cigna stock.</TE>
<TE>   "Our continued caution reflects concern that management may not
yet be fully aware of the depth of operating and financial problems,"
Borsch wrote Friday in a note to investors.</TE>
<TE>   The company took charges, both announced previously, of $720
million and $317 million to strengthen its reserves for its remaining
reinsurance contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Cigna rose $2.26 to $38.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Disney Animation Chief to Step Down</HD>
<DH>Thomas Schumacher has headed the division for nearly four
years, during which box-office results were mixed and there were
heavy layoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Eller and Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The president of Walt Disney Co.'s bedrock animation division will be
leaving his job in June after a tenure in which the operation's
successes have been overshadowed by deep layoffs and spotty
box-office numbers.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Schumacher, a 14-year Disney veteran, has been involved in
some of the studio's biggest hits, including "The Lion King,"
"Tarzan" and this summer's hit, "Lilo &amp; Stitch." He also was
instrumental in championing Disney's hugely successful partnership
with Pixar Animation Studios, which produced such blockbusters as the
"Toy Story" films, "A Bug's Life" and "Monsters, Inc."</LD>
<LD>   But during his nearly four years at the helm, he also oversaw such
big-ticket disappointments as "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" and
"Emperor's New Groove." Disney -- long the market leader in animation
-- has lost ground to rivals in recent years, especially DreamWorks
SKG, the company headed by former Disney Studios chief Jeffrey
Katzenberg that produced last summer's hit "Shrek."</LD>
<TE>   Sources close to the studio said Schumacher is negotiating a new
deal with Disney management that could keep him involved in the
company's theatrical stage business, just one aspect of the turf he
now oversees.</TE>
<TE>   Reached late Friday, Schumacher refused to comment. Disney
spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said: "He is having conversations with the
company as to what he will be doing for the company. These are
ongoing negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   With so little being said publicly, speculation spread through the
industry's animation circles Friday that Schumacher was being forced
from his position.</TE>
<TE>   However, Mucha said strongly, "That's not true."</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure as chief of animation, Schumacher oversaw a
wrenching contraction in the animation division prompted by rising
animator salaries and soaring production costs. Over the last two
years, Disney's animations ranks have shrunk from a peak of 2,200 to
1,200, with about 200 more job cuts expected by May.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher also reined in costs by slashing salaries and finding
more economical ways to make animation movies such as "Lilo &amp;
Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   According to Disney sources, the most likely successor to
Schumacher is deputy David Stainton, who heads Disney's profitable
television animation division.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher just returned from a two-week trip abroad to promote
the studio's newest animated movie, "Treasure Planet," which will be
released this month.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher became the head of animation in January 1999 after his
boss, Peter Schneider, was promoted to president of Disney Studios.
The two had run the animation division for more than a decade and
together were responsible for Disney's foray into Broadway theater
with such award-winning shows as "The Lion King," "Aida" and "Beauty
and the Beast."</TE>
<TE>   Schneider, after his surprise departure last year, became a
Broadway producer.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Schumacher is trying to decide whether to follow in
his predecessor's footsteps and strike out on his own or remain as a
Disney executive in the theater division.</TE>
<TE>   Already he has set in motion a number of Disney's planned stage
shows, including "The Little Mermaid," "Tarzan" and "Mary Poppins."</TE>

<HD>Edison Earnings Beat Expectations</HD>
<DH>Utility unit SCE helps it post $352-million net income. But
firm warns of a profit drop in '03.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A stronger performance by its battered utility unit Southern
California Edison helped Edison International post $352 million in
third-quarter net income Friday, reversing a $413-million loss a year
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Despite continuing problems at Edison International's unregulated
power-generation subsidiary Edison Mission Energy, the Rosemead-based
utility holding company said it would earn more during 2002 than
previously expected. But it also said it would earn less next year
because of uncertainty at EME and a lack of one-time items that have
boosted 2002 income.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, Edison executives painted a picture of a company
returning to health in the wake of the 2000-01 energy crisis, but one
that still faces several regulatory, legal and market challenges.</LD>
<TE>   Edison's earnings per share for the third quarter totaled $1.07,
in contrast to a loss of $1.27 a share in the July-to-September
quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The year-earlier loss reflected a $1.15-billion charge from the
sale of two power plants in England.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding charges and costs related to procurement and generation,
Edison reported operating earnings of $351 million, or $1.08 a share,
compared with $283 million, or 87 cents, a year earlier. Edison's
operating earnings beat analyst expectations by a wide margin. The
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call was 82
cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue for the third quarter edged higher to $3.99 billion from
$3.88 billion a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Edison earnings were released before the stock market opened, and
investors pushed the company's stock 31 cents higher to $10.36 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The third-quarter report "reflects good operating performance from
our three primary operating companies," John E. Bryson, chairman and
chief executive of Edison International, said during a conference
call with analysts and investors.</TE>
<TE>   For the full year, Edison raised its 2002 earnings estimate to
$1.80 to $1.90 a share, up from guidance issued last quarter of $1.65
to $1.75 a share, because of better-than-expected earnings at
Southern California Edison and Edison Mission Energy.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, however, earnings probably will be lower because of
uncertainty at Edison Mission Energy and because this year's earnings
were bolstered by one-time events, such as a reward by regulators for
meeting performance targets in previous years, said Theodore F.
Craver Jr., Edison International's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have some issues that hit the company next
year," said utility analyst Michael Worms of Gerard Klauer Mattison,
including tight credit, weak electricity demand and low power prices.</TE>
<TE>   Edison suffered during the energy crisis of 2000-01 because the
utility was paying high wholesale prices for electricity that could
not be passed along to customers under a state- mandated rate freeze.
Two rate increases last year and a deal with the California Public
Utilities Commission have allowed the utility to begin paying off its
huge power debts and return to profitability.</TE>
<TE>   But Southern California Edison faces a legal challenge to its
debt-repayment deal with the PUC. Edison also must resume buying
power for its customers Jan. 1, when the state by law must relinquish
that responsibility. And the utility is embroiled in a contentious
rate case, which will determine how much customers must pay and what
level of return on its investments the utility can earn.</TE>
<TE>   Higher rates and lower interest costs allowed SCE to post
third-quarter operating earnings of $234 million, up from $133
million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal with the PUC, Edison has collected $2.7 billion
toward the recovery of power costs from the energy crisis, with $905
million remaining to be collected.</TE>
<TE>   The Edison Mission Energy unit posted operating earnings of $149
million, down from $180 million a year earlier.</TE>

<DH>Regulator alleges fraud by the accounting firm and seeks
damages related to its audits of failed Superior Bank.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bank regulators sued accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young on Friday,
alleging fraud, negligence and professional misconduct relating to
audits of failed Chicago savings institution Superior Bank.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., in a lawsuit filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, sought
$548 million in compensatory damages, plus punitive damages.</LD>
<LD>   The owners of Superior paid a $460-million settlement to the FDIC
in December to resolve claims from the bank's costly and
controversial collapse in July 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "As a direct result of E&amp;Y's gross misstatement of Superior's
assets, the bank became insolvent, which ultimately required the FDIC
to pay out in excess of $750 million from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Fund," the FDIC said.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young disputed the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   In congressional testimony, FDIC officials have blamed Superior's
board of directors for the bank's failure, the accounting firm said.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young also cited in its defense government criticism of
federal regulators for not identifying problems early enough at the
bank.</TE>
<TE>   "Superior's failure was caused by the unfortunate and
unpredictable confluence of three factors: a substantial high-risk
subprime loan portfolio, multiple and rapid declines in interest
rates beginning early last year, and a deteriorating economy that had
a disproportionate impact on subprime borrowers," the accounting firm
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the FDIC said Ernst &amp; Young delayed disclosure of Superior's
true financial condition, and knew its treatment of Superior's assets
was improper and grossly misleading.</TE>
<TE>   The regulator alleged that the auditor knew that making auditing
problems at Superior public would have jeopardized the $11-billion
sale of the accounting firm's consulting practice to a French firm,
Gemini Cap. Ernst &amp; Young delayed disclosure of its improper
treatment of Superior's assets until after the deal was finalized,
the FDIC alleged.</TE>

<HD>Gateway Puts Cow Out to Pasture</HD>
<DH>Hoping to boost sagging sales and appear more upscale, the
computer maker is abandoning the homey Holstein in its new
commercials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frank Ahrens</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, computer company Gateway Inc. has traded on the South
Dakota roots of its founder and chief executive, Theodore W. Waitt.</LD>
<LD>   The company's brand -- either homespun or hayseed, depending on
your view -- has been symbolized by a Holstein cow. The white boxes
that the computers come in are covered with black cow spots. Gateway
Country stores are stippled with cow spots. Waitt even appeared in
television commercials with a bantering bovine.</LD>
<LD>   Now, in a series of ads designed to bolster sales and give the
company a more upscale image during the crucial holiday season, Waitt
has killed the beloved cow.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been calling it the de-prairiefication" of the company,
Waitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Why walk away from a powerful advertising symbol that once helped
propel Gateway to the top of the home PC business?</TE>
<TE>   Economically, money-losing Gateway had little choice but to seek a
new image -- and business plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The [PC] business can still be a great business," Waitt said,
"but the days of double-digit PC unit growth in the 10% to 20% range
are gone."</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of U.S. homes have PCs, and the opportunity for growth
is less than in the commercial sector. In addition, the consumer PC
market is more volatile, closely linked to consumer confidence, which
hit a nine-year low this week. Last year, for the first time since
1985, PC sales fell. Gateway PC sales peaked at 5 million in 2000 but
dropped to 3.5 million last year and 2 million so far this year,
according to the company.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Gateway has lost $228 million through the first nine
months of this year, with sales of $3.1 billion, down 37% from a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The market for digital devices -- such as Gateway's 42-inch
plasma-screen TVs, MP3 music players, digital cameras and video
recorders of the type shown in one commercial -- is still
experiencing double-digit growth and profit margins. When Waitt
decided his company would begin selling high-tech toys, he knew the
cow wasn't going to cut it.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a lot of research when we decided to expand into new
product categories, and the research at that point showed people
thought of us as a down-home, friendly PC manufacturer," said the
ponytailed Waitt. "We wanted to take the brand more upscale while not
losing our heritage."</TE>

<HD>Hispanic Broadcasting's Net Income Rises 41%; Outlook for
Year Raised</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hispanic Broadcasting Corp. -- the nation's largest Spanish-language
radio network, which is awaiting federal approval to merge with Los
Angeles-based Univision Communications Inc. -- said Friday that its
third-quarter profit rose 41%.</LD>
<LD>   Hispanic Broadcasting's net income increased to $12 million, or 11
cents a share, from $8.5 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier, thanks
to strong performance in Los Angeles and other key markets.</LD>
<LD>   The Dallas-based company also raised its earnings fore- cast for
the year to 40 cents to 41 cents a share, excluding expenses, up from
its previous estimate of 38 cents to 40 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   The company's third-quarter revenue rose to $70.2 million, up 7%
from $65.8 million a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   If federal regulators approve the $2.1-billion merger, Univision
would have a commanding market share in Spanish-language television,
radio, Internet and billboards, as well as in its Latin music
business.</TE>
<TE>   Hispanic Broadcasting owns 55 radio stations, five of them in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Univision's shares have declined about 40% this year, and the
value of the Hispanic Broadcasting deal, announced in June, has
fallen from its original price of more than $3 billion. The merger
calls for each share of Hispanic Broadcasting common stock to be
exchanged for 0.85 share of Univision common stock.</TE>
<TE>   Univision is controlled by billionaire A. Jerrold Perenchio.</TE>
<TE>   Executives of Univision and Hispanic Broadcasting say they expect
the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department to
approve the deal by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Hispanic Broadcasting rose 21 cents to $21.71 on the New
York Stock Exchange on Friday. Univision shares fell 8 cents to
$25.83, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Unemployment Rate Rises to 5.7% in October</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's unemployment rate edged up to 5.7% in October and
employers shaved payrolls by 5,000, suggesting an economy that still
is struggling more than a year after it began growing again.</LD>
<LD>   The payroll decline was the second in two months, the Labor
Department said Friday. Employers cut 13,000 jobs in September. The
new numbers suggest that Americans are in for another painfully slow
and uneven comeback like that of the "jobless recovery" of the early
1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the government said Friday that consumers cut back on
their spending by 0.4% in September, the largest decline in 10 months
and one largely traceable to a sharp drop in sales of new autos. In
addition, American manufacturing activity contracted for a second
month in a row.</LD>
<TE>   "The recession is over, but this recovery is punk," said Robert J.
Barbera, chief economist with ITG/Hoenig, a Rye, N.Y., brokerage
firm. "The best thing for people to do is to forget about the
late-'90s boom. There is no hope of getting back to that kind for a
long time to come."</TE>
<TE>   If there was any good news to be extracted from the latest
figures, it was that the 0.1-point rise in the jobless rate was less
than the 0.2-point jump that most forecasters had predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the latest signs of economic weakness made it
increasingly likely that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates
still lower when its policymaking body meets Wednesday, a day after
the midterm congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>   Although Labor Department officials described the latest job
figures as "about unchanged," details of the department's October
report paint a troubling picture for unemployed workers.</TE>
<TE>   The full dimensions of the job market weakness have been partially
obscured by moderate but transitory government hiring, mostly of
airport security guards. Private-sector jobs fell by 29,000 last
month and by 190,000 since the beginning of the year, according to
department figures.</TE>
<TE>   The fraction of the unemployed who are considered long-term and
have been out of work for six months or more rose to an eight-year
high of 20.3%. About 1.66 million people fell into that category in
October, up 71,000 from September.</TE>
<TE>   The number of unemployed workers the department considers to have
permanently lost their jobs -- as opposed to being temporarily laid
off -- jumped by 146,000 to 3.68 million. More than 1 in 2 unemployed
Americans now is counted as a permanent job loser.</TE>
<TE>   Even for people who were still working last month, the news was
not particularly encouraging. Average hourly wages, which had
continued to rise through last year's recession, increased only 3
cents, about a 3% annual rate, their slowest pace since 1995. The
average workweek and weekly wages both declined.</TE>
<TE>   Among the few industries to add workers were legal services
(7,000), health care (20,000) and the finance, insurance and real
estate sector (70,000), largely to cope with the boom in mortgage
refinancings.</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment rate among adult women unexpectedly rose from
4.9% in September to 5.2%. The rate among blacks edged up from 9.6%
to 9.8%. The rate among Latinos climbed from 7.4% to 7.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the latest employment report and the other
statistics released Friday showed an economy that is stuck in the mud
-- not sinking but unable to move forward despite continued buying by
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Sharply reduced demand for big-ticket items such as new cars and
trucks was largely responsible for September's 0.4% drop in
consumption. The decline offset August's similar-sized increase and
occurred despite a 0.4% increase in Americans' income and automakers'
offers of low-interest financing.</TE>
<TE>   October new-vehicle sales fell to an annualized pace of 15.4
million units, from 16.3 million in September and 18.7 million in
August. Analysts said October sales were the slowest since April
1998.</TE>

<KH>THE MICROSOFT DECISION</KH>
<HD>1 Case, Hundreds of Lawyers</HD>
<DH>Attorneys general, private counsel and aides add up to a
full-court press against Microsoft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How many lawyers does it take to sue Microsoft Corp.?</LD>
<LD>   You'd probably have to hire a lawyer to get an exact count. But an
unofficial examination of some of the most significant filings in the
4-year-old antitrust case against the software giant reveals the
number is easily in the hundreds.</LD>
<LD>   More than 70 legal representatives are listed in just five of the
documents filed since the Justice Department, 19 states and the
District of Columbia sued Microsoft on May 18, 1998. And for almost
every one of those names, there were several additional lawyers
working behind the scenes.</LD>
<TE>   "When you have a case with such an enormous amount of economic
interests involved, you don't want anyone to ever say, 'You didn't
fight tough enough,' " said Ernest Gellhorn, professor of antitrust
law at George Mason University in Virginia. "So when things get
difficult, you throw another lawyer in there."</TE>
<TE>   In the initial filings, every state in the suit listed its
attorney general as a lawyer of record, and each of them was backed
by a taxpayer-funded staff. Some states hired private attorneys to
help with the load. The federal government also posted its own squad
of attorneys from the public and private sectors.</TE>
<TE>   As time went on, several Microsoft rivals and other corporations
joined the fray with in-house and outside counsel, along with lawyers
representing nine media outlets. Consumers, acting for themselves,
filed their own legal briefs.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Microsoft fielded its own small army of attorneys. A
spokesman for the Redmond, Wash.-based company declined to estimate
how many lawyers it employed.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually you reach the point of diminishing returns," Gellhorn
said. "We're long past that."</TE>
<TE>   The gargantuan task of keeping track of all these lawyers -- and
coordinating all their work -- depends on one of the central issues
of the court battle: technology.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of it happens by e-mail," said Iowa Deputy Atty. Gen. Tam
Ormiston.</TE>
<TE>   The Iowa attorney general's office is leading the faction of nine
states, including California, that balked at the settlement brokered
by the Justice Department and pressed for tougher sanctions against
Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to create an office without walls," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Ormiston and Atty. Gen. Tom Miller, Iowa has only
one other staff attorney on the case. Much of the state's heavy
lifting is being done by high-powered Washington attorney Brendan
Sullivan, best known for successfully defending former Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros against conspiracy charges
and keeping Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North out of prison over his role
in the Iran-Contra scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan was hired by California, which is paying his undisclosed
fee. Sullivan's secretary wouldn't say how many lawyers at his
white-shoe firm Williams &amp; Connolly were working with him.</TE>
<TE>   California itself has five staff lawyers from the attorney
general's office on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate attorneys representing Sun Microsystems Inc., AOL Time
Warner Inc., Apple Computer Inc. and other Microsoft rivals filed
numerous briefs in support of the lawsuit. Attorneys for The Times,
other newspapers and television networks chimed in to argue that
federal laws passed a century ago granting the press access to
depositions in antitrust cases still applied.</TE>
<TE>   And then there were folks such as Robert Koenig.</TE>
<TE>   The 56-year-old, who runs a travel Web site out of his home in
Oyster Bay, N.Y., filed a brief arguing that Microsoft should be
broken up to quash its anti-competitive behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is not an attorney, he used a free form he came across
at a law school Web site and was done in two hours. In this case,
technology worked to Microsoft's disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just an average Joe, but I had something I wanted the judge
to know," Koenig said. "Often, monopolists make their successes with
brains and good luck, but then they take it too far. I love Microsoft
products, but I said it would be better to break the company up."</TE>

<HD>Clear Win for Software Giant</HD>
<DH>States say their efforts improved settlement reached with
Justice Department, but they acknowledge coming up short.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli and Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nine states seeking wider restrictions against Microsoft Corp.
tried to put an upbeat face on a federal court decision Friday that
largely rebuffed their efforts, upholding a settlement that had been
reached by the Justice Department and other states.</LD>
<LD>   But for all their pronouncements, Friday's ruling was a clear
victory for the Redmond, Wash., software giant, said antitrust
experts, Microsoft competitors and others who had a stake in the
outcome.</LD>
<LD>   "The decision is a huge disappointment for those that would want
to restore competition to the monopolized marketplace," said Mitchell
S. Pettit, head of the Project to Promote Competition and Innovation,
a Washington lobby group that opposes Microsoft. The breakthrough
Internet Web browser Netscape "was the greatest innovation in the
1990s. Microsoft kills it off and this judge says that's OK. I find
that astonishing."</LD>
<TE>   In a conference call with reporters, five attorneys general said
their arguments and the evidence they introduced during 32 days of
trial earlier this year persuaded the court to make some adjustments
to "improve the settlement."</TE>
<TE>   But even they acknowledged that they came up short. California
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said the states urged the court to "look
ahead, to look into new areas" of Microsoft domination. "Basically,
the court said, 'I can't do that. If you want to go there, file a new
lawsuit.' "</TE>
<TE>   Given that the case already has dragged on for four years, it's
unlikely that California, eight other states and the District of
Columbia would appeal, experts said, though the states' top law
enforcers indicated they would consider such an option while they
study the 344-page opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been litigating long enough to know that you get some
things and some you don't," said Iowa Atty. Gen. Tom Miller, who led
the coalition challenging the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut Atty. Gen. Richard Blumenthal said the states, which
have spent several million dollars pursuing Microsoft, will be
reimbursed by the company for their costs under Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to oversee and make sure that Microsoft follows
the law," Blumenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   The states believe they won the judge's ear on three issues,
pointing particularly to one that sets up a compliance committee.
Though consisting of three Microsoft board members who aren't
employees or officers, the committee would be run by a non-company
compliance officer who would report violations of the settlement to
the attorneys general, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "The court made it clear that it will impose accountability at the
highest levels," Blumenthal said. With such a body reporting
violations, added Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Tom Riley, "the final
chapter is not written."</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys general also noted that Kollar-Kotelly closed some
loopholes that could have let Microsoft flex monopolistic muscles.
And she added "threat of retaliation" to a list of prohibitions
against any Microsoft reactions to competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest change, however, may well be Kollar-Kotelly's decision
to assert continuing supervision of the settlement, say antitrust
lawyers and experts, who debated whether she intended to assume a
role similar to that of the late U.S. District Judge Harold Greene in
the mid-1980s in supervising the breakup of the AT&amp;T Corp. telephone
monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   "In the ruling she expanded her powers to give her constant
jurisdiction over the case," said Ernest Gellhorn, an antitrust
expert and a law professor at George Mason University law school in
Fairfax, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Dartmouth University professor and lawyer Carey Heckman said the
judge's expanded role gives everyone another place to take their
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gellhorn and other experts said the expansion of
oversight authority was more a preventive measure than a punitive
one. They believe that in all other respects Microsoft won nearly a
complete victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think she anticipates that this [oversight] will be a
quasi-regulatory role for her," said Philip Beck, a Chicago lawyer
hired by the Justice Department to serve as special trial counsel in
the Microsoft case. "She won't be the czar of personal computers. But
she wants every tool at her disposal to make sure Microsoft complies
with her order."</TE>

<HD>O'Neill Unaware of Lucent Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill is unaware of any probe by federal
regulators into accounting at Lucent Technologies Inc. when he was on
the audit committee of the telecom equipment maker, a spokeswoman for
O'Neill said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "Corporate misdeeds revealed during the last year led the
secretary to be very vocal in calling for increased corporate
disclosure and greater accountability for CEOs," the spokeswoman,
Michele Davis, said. "The secretary is not aware of any SEC inquiry
into the audit committee, but he is confident that the audit
committee acted appropriately during his tenure."</LD>
<LD>   She declined to comment further.</LD>
<TE>   Lucent reported revenue recognition problems in November 2000 and
revised its fiscal 2000 fourth-quarter sales by $679 million a month
later, and the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent now faces a broader SEC probe covering possible earnings
manipulations dating as far back as the mid-1990s, the Wall Street
Journal reported Friday. Regulators also are looking at whether
current or former Lucent board members, including O'Neill, may have
been aware of accounting violations at the company, the paper said,
citing people familiar with the probe.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill joined Lucent's board in October 1996 and resigned in
December 2000 to join the Cabinet of incoming President George W.
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Moody's Investors Service cut its ratings on Lucent,
affecting about $7 billion of debt, to low "junk" status, saying the
company is quickly using up cash as sales fall.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent's shares fell 9 cents to $1.14 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent officials said they had no knowledge of a widening of the
federal probe and said the investigation was old news.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC repeatedly has declined to discuss the probe and did so
again Friday.</TE>

<HD>Market Starts Month Strong as Rally Continues</HD>
<DH>Wall Street shakes off three weak economic reports to post
its fourth straight weekly gain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market continued to shake off disappointing economic data
Friday, giving key indexes their fourth straight weekly gain.</LD>
<LD>   With the Federal Reserve poised to cut short-term interest rates
next week, more investors may be betting that stocks are a better
alternative to bonds and to short-term cash accounts in the near
term, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials rose 120.61 points, or 1.4%, to 8,517.64, and
added 0.9% for the week.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite advanced 30.95 points, or 2.3%, to 1,360.70,
and finished 2.2% higher for the week. Nasdaq had not had a four-week
winning streak since November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, which jumped 15.20 points, or
1.7%, to 900.96 on Friday, posted a gain of 0.4% for the week.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts attributed the rally in part to the buying momentum that
built up throughout October. Stocks began to rebound at mid-month
from five-year lows, helped in part by some better-than-expected
corporate earnings reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Investor psychology has changed. The market has become very
resilient to bad news. Today is a good example of that," said Michael
Murphy, head trader at Wachovia Securities in Baltimore. "Nobody
wants to be left behind."</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 23 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The market's advance gained steam through Friday's session,
despite downbeat reports on October employment, auto sales and
manufacturing activity.</TE>
<TE>   The economic news appeared to cement expectations that Fed
policymakers will cut their benchmark short-term interest rate when
they meet Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's rate is 1.75%, a 40-year low. A Reuters survey of 22
Treasury bond dealers showed that 21 expected a rate cut. Most
believed the Fed would trim the rate by 0.25 point, to 1.5%.</TE>
<TE>   That would be the first Fed cut in 11 months.</TE>
<TE>   Though many economists question whether another drop in rates
would make much difference to potential borrowers, experts said a
reduction could be a confidence builder for some businesses and
consumers as the economy struggles to regain momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "In the short run, corporate restructuring will probably lead to
further job cuts during the next several months -- hence the need for
further Fed action," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill
Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   In the Treasury bond market, yields rose Friday after falling for
much of the week. Traders said that although the market continued to
expect a Fed rate cut, the Treasury's plans to sell $40 billion in
new long-term bonds next week weighed on sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the fear of supply hitting the market" that is hurting
Treasuries, Bret Barker, who handles government debt investments at
Metropolitan West Asset Management in Los Angeles, told Bloomberg
News.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year T-note yield ended Friday at 4%, up from 3.9%
Thursday. The two-year T-note yield ended at 1.77%, up from 1.67%.</TE>
<TE>   Still, yields were lower than a week ago, when the 10-year note
was at 4.09% and the two-year note was at 1.98%.</TE>
<TE>   Among Friday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of semiconductor makers helped lead the tech sector
higher. Intel rose $1 to $18.30, National Semiconductor gained $1.22
to $14.50, and Broadcom gained $1.03 to $13.01.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy-related stocks attracted buyers. Anadarko Petroleum
gained $1.28 to $45.82, and Baker Hughes gained $1.40 to $30.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial issues rallied. Goldman Sachs rose $1.85 to $73.45,
and Bank One gained $1.16 to $39.73.</TE>
<TE>   * Overture Services tumbled $4.48 to $23.05 after the Internet
search provider was downgraded to "in line" from "outperform" by
Salomon Smith Barney, which cited increased competition.</TE>
<TE>   * H&amp;R Block dived $3.43 to $40.95 over shareholders' concerns
about several lawsuits the tax preparer faces over its
refund-anticipation loans.</TE>

<HD>Small Investors Flock to State Power Bonds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state's sale of fixed-rate power bonds is drawing heavy interest
from small investors.</LD>
<LD>   The $6.75-billion bond offering, which will repay loans the state
took on to buy power during the energy crisis of 2000 and 2001,
attracted $975 million in orders from individual investors by Friday
afternoon, according to J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., the deal's lead
underwriter.</LD>
<LD>   Brokers will continue to take small-investor orders on Monday,
before inviting institutional investors to bid for the bonds Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Yield estimates provided by J.P. Morgan show the state expects to
pay returns that are higher than what is available on many other
investment-grade tax-free bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The annualized yield on the uninsured 10-year issue was estimated
at 4.44%. That interest will be exempt from federal and state income
tax for California investors, so the true return can be substantially
higher, depending on an investor's tax bracket.</TE>
<TE>   The power bonds will be sold in maturities ranging from 2 1/2
years to 20 years. They will be repaid by surcharges on the
electricity bills of the state's major utilities.</TE>
<TE>   The state is offering some of the bonds with private insurance
that guarantees repayment. Yields on those bonds will be lower than
what the uninsured bonds pay. The yield on the 10-year insured issue
was estimated at 3.84% on Friday.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS, Partner Buy Napa Valley Vineyard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Employees' Retirement System said Friday that
it bought more than 100 acres in Napa Valley, its first purchase
under a $100-million plan to develop vineyards on the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest public pension fund bought the land with
Premier Pacific Vineyards Inc., a privately held firm with which it
has an agreement to acquire grape-growing parcels in California,
Oregon and Washington state. CalPERS invested $6 million of the
$6.6-million purchase price. The rest came from Premier Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS is increasing its presence in real estate in an attempt to
bolster portfolio returns as stocks have sunk. The pension fund has
$13 billion of its $135 billion in assets in commercial, residential
and other real estate, and says it plans to boost that further.</LD>
<TE>   "We're in the market now looking for other transactions," said
Richard Wollack, co-chief executive of Premier Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS and Premier Pacific paid $60,000 for each of the 110 acres
that will be planted, land known as the Suscol Bench Vineyard. It was
purchased from Silverado Premium Properties, said Jeff Ottoboni, vice
president of finance and administration at Premier Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS projects an annual return of 18% on the investment,
according to a memo released at its Oct. 15 investment committee
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS and its partner plan to buy land and sell developed
parcels to wine producers within five to seven years, betting that
winemakers will find it more economical to acquire existing
vineyards. CalPERS and Premier Pacific will grow grapes for wines
priced at $20 or more a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for high-end wine is growing in the United States, and
vineyard prices are following suit.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of wine priced at more than $15 a bottle reached 15 million
cases last year, up 8.7% from 13.8 million cases in 2000, according
to Motto Kryla Fisher, a St. Helena, Calif., firm that provides
consulting and research services to wineries. Sales grew 21% in 2000
and 10.7% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The land bought by CalPERS is earmarked mainly for Cabernet. Sales
of California Cabernet accounted for one-quarter of the high-end
total last year, reaching 3.8 million cases, up 12% from 3.4 million
cases in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Producing vineyards in Napa Valley fetched between $85,000 and
$180,000 an acre last year, up from a high of $50,000 in 1994, said
Michael Fisher, a partner at Motto Kryla Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are eyeing vineyards now "because the stock market is
lousy," said John Mattern, a principal at property broker Keegan &amp;
Coppin Co. in Santa Rosa, who specializes in vineyard land sales.</TE>

<HD>Shipping Lines, Union Agree on Key Port Issue</HD>
<DH>Tentative breakthrough on modernization comes after
all-night talks. Negotiations are continuing on wages and pension
benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The longshore union and the shipping industry reached a tentative
agreement on labor-saving technology -- the stickiest issue in their
prolonged dispute -- Friday after all-night talks with three federal
mediators and a top AFL-CIO official.</LD>
<LD>   No details were released on the deal, which both sides saw as a
breakthrough in the stalemate that has disrupted commercial trade at
West Coast ports for more than a month.</LD>
<LD>   Wages and pension benefits still must be hammered out, according
to both the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which
represents 10,500 dockworkers, and the Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents nearly 80 shipping lines and terminal operators.</LD>
<TE>   From the time talks began in mid-May, however, it was the
introduction of labor-saving technology that has bitterly divided the
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Shipping lines have long complained the West Coast terminals are
inefficient because of union resistance to technology. Among other
things, the maritime companies want to introduce scanners that track
the movement of containers, and computer systems that allow cargo
lists to flow directly into terminals rather than being retyped by
longshore clerks.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the negotiations, the ILWU said it would accept the new
systems, which would mean the loss of hundreds of highly paid clerk
jobs, only if the union represented all jobs created by the new
technology. Labor leaders also wanted dozens of non-union planning
jobs to be brought under ILWU jurisdiction, including those that
involve the placement of containers on ships and at terminal yards.
The PMA had balked at expanding union jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the deal, reached just before dawn, allows for the
free flow of cargo information into terminals while guaranteeing jobs
for life to all registered union clerks. A compromise reportedly was
reached on union jurisdiction with regard to planning jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations resumed Friday afternoon at a San Francisco hotel
with three federal mediators and AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard
Trumka. An industry source said he hoped a final agreement could be
reached by early next week, but union spokesman Steve Stallone said
"that's a rather optimistic view."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released Friday, Peter J. Hurtgen, director of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, said he would "continue
negotiations today and day by day until there is a full and complete
agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Sources on the industry side said the new technology agreement is
similar to a deal they announced in late September, which was
rejected by union leaders the following day.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, ILWU President James Spinosa angrily said he would
remove technology from the talks. He then told members to "work
safely" and strictly follow all government regulations. Days later,
the PMA closed all commercial ports from San Diego to Seattle,
complaining that union slowdowns had made running the terminals
unprofitable. The union insisted that the reduced productivity was
due to unusually high cargo volumes.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 8, President Bush invoked the rarely used Taft-Hartley Act

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Micron Technology Inc., the world's second-largest maker of personal
computer memory chips, asked the U.S. to set duties on chip imports
from South Korea, saying the Korean government illegally subsidizes
producers.</LD>
<LD>   Boise, Idaho-based Micron said multibillion-dollar government
bailouts and subsidized loans to companies such as Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. violate global trade rules and have caused injury
to Micron. It filed the case with the Commerce Department and the
International Trade Commission, a U.S. agency that measures the
effects of trade.</LD>
<LD>   Micron filed the case against the South Korean government after
its $3-billion bid to buy Hynix earlier this year was rejected by the
Korean company's board.</LD>
<TE>   Micron shares rose 80 cents to $16.80 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As many as 26,000 people who recently stayed at Holiday Inns or
sister hotels were charged 100 times what they owed because of a
credit processing error.</LD>
<LD>   The glitch eliminated the decimal points in bills for about half
the guests who stayed at a Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express or Crowne
Plaza hotel from Oct. 24 to Sunday, said Carolyn Hergert, spokeswoman
for Atlanta-based Six Continents Hotels, which owns the hotel chains.</LD>
<LD>   A charge of $100, for example, would have been billed as $10,000.</LD>
<TE>   Hergert said the mistake was made by First Horizon Merchant
Services of Englewood, Colo., which processes credit cards used by
hotel guests.</TE>
<TE>   Six Continents said First Horizon had contacted the credit card
issuers, which were reversing the billing errors.</TE>

<LD>Hedge funds controlled by money managers Peter Collery and Neil
Koffler acquired a 5% stake in SCPIE Holdings Inc., a Los
Angeles-based provider of medical malpractice insurance whose shares
have fallen 86% this year.</LD>
<LD>   SC Fundamental, a New York investment advisory firm, acquired
492,300 shares through funds it controls as an investment, according
to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.</LD>
<LD>   "The mistakes SCPIE made had a very significant impact on earnings
for the past couple years but didn't affect the book value of the
company to any great extent," Collery said. "For the stock to have
gone down 80% is an overreaction."</LD>
<TE>   SCPIE rose 12 cents to $4.12 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Heart Patient Sues Tenet, Physician</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit follows public disclosure of FBI probe. Hospital
chain executives try to reassure investors and analysts as shares
sink.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last June, shortly after his 55th birthday, John Corapi got the bad
news from Dr. Chae H. Moon, director of the cardiology department at
Tenet Healthcare Corp.'s Redding Medical Center. Corapi had splits in
his arteries, according to Moon's June 11 report. His recommendation:
bypass surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next two weeks, Corapi sought second opinions from
doctors in Las Vegas, where he had previously lived. Corapi met with
five cardiologists, said his lawyer, Dugan Barr, and all of them told
Corapi there was no need for bypass surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Barr said Corapi, a Catholic priest, told Redding Medical Center's
chief executive about the discrepancy but was told to stick with
Moon's plan. Then, Barr said, his client contacted the FBI,
triggering what has become a major investigation of possible fraud
involving Moon and another Redding doctor, Fidel Realyvasquez Jr.
Authorities are investigating whether the doctors performed
unnecessary heart procedures on hundreds of patients. No charges have
been filed against either man.</LD>
<TE>   Federal authorities have not said the hospital or Tenet are
targets, although about 40 agents raided the medical center on
Wednesday, seizing records and computers. The probe, which was made
public Thursday, has created a crisis for Tenet Healthcare.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Corapi's attorney filed a lawsuit in Shasta County
Superior Court against Moon, the hospital and Tenet, accusing them of
negligence, fraud and deceit. Corapi was traveling and could not be
reached.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara-based hospital company sought in a long
conference call to restore confidence among investors and analysts
who have hammered the stock amid concerns about Tenet management's
integrity and responsibility for the doctors' behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey C. Barbakow,
apologized for waiting a day before disclosing news of the raid, and
company officials added more details about the launch of an internal
investigation into the practices of Moon and Realyvasquez, who have
been practicing in Redding for many years.</TE>
<TE>   Christi R. Sulzbach, Tenet's executive vice president and general
counsel, said that every future medical procedure Moon and
Realyvasquez propose to do at the hospital would be reviewed by an
independent physician to ensure that it is medically necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The two doctors still have operating privileges at the Redding
hospital. Analysts questioned why they were still practicing there,
and Tenet said that is up to a committee of doctors at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Moon and Realyvasquez, chairman of cardiac surgery at the
hospital, could not be reached Friday, but Realyvasquez's attorney
has said that the case is a disagreement among doctors about what
constitutes proper medical care.</TE>
<TE>   In an affidavit filed by FBI Agent Michael Skeen, whom Barr said
his client had first contacted, the two doctors performed an
unusually heavy volume of heart catheterizations and other
procedures, including bypass operations. The FBI said that as many as
half of the procedures may have been unnecessary, based on opinions
of other doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said they came away from the 2 1/2-hour conference
call feeling better about Tenet. But they remained wary of the
company and its stock. The teleconference was held after the close of
markets. Tenet's shares continued their descent Friday, down 8%, or
$2.25, to $26.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Counting Thursday's
$10.22 share-price drop, Tenet's once highflying stock has fallen by
more than one-third in just two trading days.</TE>
<TE>   Among analysts' concerns is that the FBI has said in the affidavit
that some doctors in Redding had raised concerns about Moon and
Realyvasquez to top hospital administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Harold Chilton, the Redding Medical Center's chief
executive, and other hospital administrators were referred to Tenet.
In the conference call, Sulzbach said she had not talked to Chilton,
but she said that "our best information" was that the CEO had never
been approached by doctors with such allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Barr and other lawyers in Redding, who reported receiving dozens
of calls Friday from former patients of Moon and Realyvasquez, said
they found it hard to believe that Tenet officials missed red flags.</TE>
<TE>   "Other cardiologists in town have complained" about the two
doctors, said Robert Simpson, who has been a lawyer in Redding for 22
years. How could Tenet deny knowing of problems "when they have two
doctors in Redding, a small regional center, producing more income
than doctors in large regional centers?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Redding Medical Center's Web site, the hospital
performs about 200 heart catheterizations a month and 700 open-heart
surgeries annually. Residents of Redding said the hospital frequently
advertises its California Heart Institute as a highly rated center
with low morbidity rates.</TE>
<TE>   According to state filings by Tenet, the Redding hospital
generated pretax net income of $94 million in the 12 months ended
June 30 -- the highest among Tenet's 40 hospitals in California.
Mercy Medical Center, the other hospital in Redding with slightly
more beds, reported pretax net income of about $5 million in the same
period.</TE>

<HD>Student Cheaters Ultimately Cheat Only Themselves</HD>

<LD>A report by the Josephson Institute of Ethics shows a continuing rise
in student cheating, as well as stealing and lying. From 1992 to
2002, according to the report, the percentage of high school students
who admitted they cheated on an exam in the past year increased from
61% to 74%. Two high school students shared their observations on
student cheating with MARY REESE BOYKIN.</LD>

<TE>   Many students have lots of distractions at home -- the telephone,
television, computers -- that interfere with doing homework or
preparing for tests. Because they are unprepared, they look at a
friend's paper when the teacher is not watching.</TE>
<TE>   I am an A student. I budget my time, even though I have basketball
practice and don't arrive home from my bus ride until 6 p.m. But I
have had friends tell me that they didn't study or didn't know how to
do the work or didn't try. They anticipate that the kid next to them
studied, and they look at that student's paper. I have on occasion
knowingly let someone copy from my paper. It was a smart kid who went
blank on a question. I know he studied, so I put my paper to the edge
so that he could get a look.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that it is not cheating if you don't get caught. But to
me, cheating is cheating, for you are cheating yourself of an
opportunity to learn. There have been times when I have been tempted
to tell the teacher that a classmate cheated, especially when the
student made a grade higher than that of most of us who studied. But
I decided that another student's cheating was not my business. I
didn't have the courage to confront the student or to tell the
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Students also cheat by downloading reports from the Internet. Some
don't take into consideration that plagiarizing is illegal. They
rationalize that they couldn't find time to complete the assignment
or that downloading information was convenient. I think all types of
kids cheat. Some are really smart, but they forget to study, panic,
and then resort to cheating so that their grades won't drop.</TE>

<TE>   Donald Shead</TE>
<TE>   Senior, Inglewood High School, Inglewood</TE>
<TE>   I recently enrolled at Inglewood after having attended a private
school for two years. There was lots more cheating there than at my
current school.</TE>
<TE>   At the private school, parents put more pressure on students to
make good grades. Students felt that they couldn't disappoint their
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Some became very creative in their cheating.</TE>
<TE>   They would, for example, type cheat notes on a computer and print
them in small print. Then they would put the notes in a pen that had
a clear space. As they took their tests, they pretended to be
fidgeting with their pen while they copied.</TE>
<TE>   Many of my classmates at the private school took the attitude that
they were not going to fail a class and that they didn't have time to
go to summer school. They had the security of knowing that no one
would tell the teacher, for the tattletale is not respected.</TE>
<TE>   But I don't think that I could be satisfied knowing that I cheated
to get higher grades. Sometimes I felt frustrated when I studied hard
and made a B but the student who cheated made an A. When I voiced my
feelings to another student, he would say, "Well, if you had cheated,
you would have made an A too."</TE>

<HD>Santa Monica Businesses Can Afford Living Wages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sheila James Kuehl</AU>
<BD>Democrat Sheila James Kuehl represents Santa Monica in
the California Senate.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Santa Monica has pumped nearly $200 million in taxpayer
funds into its transformation from a sleepy coastal town into a
world-class tourist destination, greatly enriching beach hotels and
other private businesses with public dollars. Yet while coastal
hotels, restaurants and retailers benefited from this investment,
their employees did not.</LD>
<LD>   Despite working full time -- most for luxury hotels charging
hundreds of dollars a night for a room -- many tourism workers cannot
provide their families with basic necessities and must rely on
government anti-poverty programs or charity.</LD>
<LD>   Measure JJ on Santa Monica's Nov. 5 ballot would help to rectify
this inequity. The ballot measure, which covers only businesses that
gross more than $5 million a year, would increase the wages of an
estimated 2,000 workers in the tourist area along the coast to $10.50
an hour. That is the point at which a person supporting a family of
four no longer qualifies for food stamps.</LD>
<TE>   In an immigrant working-class neighborhood in Los Angeles, the
average two-bedroom apartment rents for $1,000 a month. On a salary
of $7 or $8 an hour, that leaves virtually nothing for food,
utilities, clothing or anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these workers do not have employer-provided family health
benefits and cannot afford insurance, so they are left to depend on
publicly funded clinics, many of which have recently been shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, rather than embracing an opportunity to correct a
problem -- amply documented in a study commissioned by the city --
Santa Monica's tourism industry has spent nearly $2 million to block
the living-wage law.</TE>
<TE>   It has contracted with aggressive public relations firms, such as
the Dolphin Group -- architects of the racially inflammatory Willie
Horton ads and tobacco company campaigns -- and with a firm whose
partners represented corrupt former state Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush.</TE>
<TE>   Whom should the voters trust? People who are paid to obfuscate the
truth or hundreds of community and religious leaders who have worked
to promote the public interest for years?</TE>
<TE>   We have been told that this law will reduce social services.
That's false; Santa Monica can afford to pay the living wage and
maintain its budget priorities. We've been told that this law
discriminates. That's false; the law helps those workers in need of
immediate relief. We've been told this will ruin the tourist
industry. That's false; the industry is one of the most prosperous in
the country and can readily afford to pay workers enough to support
their families in dignity.</TE>
<TE>   Measure JJ is a carefully crafted law that will not cover small or
medium-size businesses, and it includes a hardship exemption for
businesses facing financial difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   If California were a country, it would have the sixth-largest
economy in the world. Santa Monica, one of the state's most
prosperous corners, should not permit people whose hard work supports
one of our most important industries to live without adequate food,
shelter and medical care, relying on taxpayer-funded services to
survive.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The slap on the wrist that U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly
in Washington gave Microsoft on Friday should trouble you if:</LD>
<LD>   * You tried to use your laptop's hot new wireless card to check
your e-mail and Windows crashed because your Internet service
provider hadn't been able to pay Microsoft enough to get the latest
coding.</LD>
<LD>   * You scrambled to download music from a neighborhood garage band
but were out of luck because the tracks were recorded in software
written by Real Networks and every time you tried to play them,
Microsoft's Media Player came on the screen to scold: "unsupported
format."</LD>
<TE>   * You lust for a new palmtop, the one with the full-color screen
and cut-rate price, but your company's computer administrator rolls
her eyes condescendingly because only one model will work with the
company's Outlook server.</TE>
<TE>   * You live in the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Like the woefully ineffectual verdict that the Bush administration
worked out with Microsoft last year, Kollar-Kotelly's ruling does
next to nothing to rein in future abuse by the big-dog corporation,
which controls 96% of the world's Web browser market and 93% of the
world's home computer operating system market.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly could have, and should have, strengthened the
settlement by requiring Microsoft to disclose the operating system
coding that independent programmers need to fit their programs, like
Velcro, onto Windows. She also should have compelled Microsoft to
work with streaming-media rivals like Real Networks and offer a less
expensive, stripped-down version of Windows that your company can
fine-tune so it works with that cool new palmtop you want to buy.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Kollar-Kotelly weakened the Bush settlement. For example,
she replaced an independent technical committee that would have
enforced Microsoft's compliance with a three-member panel appointed
-- astonishingly -- by Microsoft's own board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The three members must not be current or former Microsoft
employees, Kollar-Kotelly said, but, needless to say, that hardly
rules out conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   This page has often scolded the Clinton administration and U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the previous judge in the
Microsoft case, for overzealous attempts to tear apart the software
giant. Kollar-Kotelly's verdict, however, failed to recognize that
even worse than government intervention in the free market was a
monopolist market in which one company bullied all others and
introduced impossibly high barriers to entry by competitors.</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and the officials of eight
other states still party to the Microsoft lawsuit should appeal
Kollar-Kotelly's rude, post-Halloween surprise. It may take years,
but surely an appeals court will uphold the principle of vibrant
competition that Microsoft has so often dampened.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when parents finally had their children's schedules figured out
for maximum success skills, along comes this new blather about
unstructured play.</LD>
<LD>   Up to now, it's been soccer practice Tuesday afternoons and games
on Saturday mornings (remember, 80% of L.A. children can't hack the
test for the President's Council on Physical Fitness). Monday is
private tutoring in standardized test-taking skills. Wednesdays are
for after-school piano lessons, which have been linked to better
spatial reasoning (whatever that is, we're sure it will come in handy
for the SATs in 10 years). Scouts on Thursdays for socialization.
Meetings of the Primary School Reading to the Literate Club on
Fridays (all the top universities are looking for community service
these days). And Sunday school, of course (something for the
spiritual side).</LD>
<LD>   The latest thinking, though, is that the kids have been
overscheduled. All these childhood experts are praising recess and
play and the importance of letting kids just hang around, making up
their own games or imagining things. It's been the subject of studies
at Case Western Reserve and the University of Michigan.</LD>
<TE>   This isn't just about meaningless stuff like letting kids have fun
and enjoy life. No, this is important. It turns out that unstructured
play, the kind that doesn't need instruction or adults to organize it
or expensive equipment, is thought to develop creativity and
problem-solving ability, perceptual and cognitive and social skills,
every psychologically correct thing you can name. It seems that all
parents ever needed for their kids to get into Harvard was to give
them an empty packing box as a toy. Despite all their effort, once
again the clueless parents have been depriving their children of an
important developmental tool. There's just no winning.</TE>
<TE>   Or is there? Those Saturday afternoons are still free, and it
can't be long before some entrepreneur takes advantage of that slot
to offer Unstructured Play Class at the community center at $49 for
the series, $13 per drop-in. The advanced class in Guided Imagination
would cost a little more.</TE>
<TE>   The Back to Basics children's toy catalog is bound to come out
with its Vintage-Style Brown Cardboard Box to foster unstructured
play skills, with the large size selling for just under $100.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, we could all just wait for new studies to say that
letting kids watch hours of TV with a remote control in hand fosters
quick-reaction skills and small-motor development.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeffrey C. Eglash spent 3 1/2 years shining a Mag-Lite into a
shuttered and battened-down Los Angeles Police Department. As the
civilian Police Commission's inspector general, his job was to
scrutinize a department infamous for resisting oversight. In the end,
the passion and integrity he brought to the task couldn't make up for
the former chief's stonewalling and the lack of backup from a
skittish and divided commission.</LD>
<LD>   So it's no surprise, just a shame, that a weary Eglash announced
last week that he planned to resign -- just as the LAPD may at last
be about to raise the windows and fling open the doors. That at least
appears to be the signal from newly installed Police Chief William J.
Bratton, who through an emissary tried to persuade Eglash to stay.
When that failed, a disappointed Bratton promised a "transparent"
department that would cooperate with Eglash's successor.</LD>
<TE>   Proof that civilian oversight can be made to work is as close as
Los Angeles County. Around the time that the Christopher Commission,
formed after the Rodney King beating, first called for independent
overview of the LAPD, the county Board of Supervisors asked retired
Superior Court Judge James Kolts to investigate excessive-force
allegations within the Sheriff's Department. While the city dragged
its feet on Christopher Commission recommendations, the supervisors
followed up by hiring Merrick Bobb, who headed the Kolts Commission,
to monitor reform, which he continues to do.</TE>
<TE>   At the peak of the LAPD's Rampart corruption scandal, Sheriff Lee
Baca asked the supervisors to expand oversight -- unheard of in law
enforcement -- by creating an Office of Independent Review staffed by
six full-time civil rights lawyers. In its first report, issued last
month, the new watchdog team found that the Sheriff's Department had
over the last decade failed to investigate more than 800 claims of
wrongdoing by its deputies, ranging from reckless driving to
improperly served search warrants. The supervisors got so caught up
in demanding an explanation from Baca for the lapses that they missed
the real import of the report: Exposing the problem has led the
department to change its policy so that all claims will be
automatically reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   The report and its follow-up represent a shift in culture from the
police code of silence to one more common to a 12-step program:
Admitting problems is the first step toward solving them. "As
embarrassing as they may be," Bobb says, "in the long run confronting
them means less injury to the public and fewer lawsuits."</TE>
<TE>   For civilian oversight to work, the office doing the overseeing
must have unfettered access to the department, authority to protect
the confidentiality of informants and freedom to issue unvarnished
reports.</TE>
<TE>   That approach appears to be taking hold in the Sheriff's
Department and can become rooted in the LAPD too, if the new chief
sets a tone of cooperation and openness and the new Police Commission
holds him to it.</TE>

<LD>"Health Care Agendas Leave Patients Out," by Steve Lopez, Oct. 27:
When will the leaders and the citizens of this country realize that
the only so-called superpower in the world today is not a Third World
but more like a "Fifth World" nation when it comes to health care for
its citizens?</LD>
<LD>   I firmly believe that our stubborn refusal even to consider
universal medical coverage puts us at greater risk from sickness and
disease than from an outside terrorist attack or war. Only a healthy
population can face the vicissitudes of everyday life, much less
combat. The boogeyman of higher taxes is a false and specious
argument. If all of the agencies now in place -- Medicare,
Medicaid/Medi-Cal, workers' compensation, even the health-care
component of the Veterans Affairs Department -- were combined into
one national health-care agency, the cost savings would be
phenomenal. And individual taxation could not possibly be as high as
insurance costs are today for the ever-fewer people who are able to
afford such a luxury.</LD>
<TE>   To those who point to minor failings in the systems of other
countries, I say we can choose the best of all the plans at work in
every enlightened nation but ours -- and avoid their pitfalls -- to
devise the best and most workable yet. I know for certain that even a
complaining Canadian or Briton considers his coverage far superior to
the ever-diminishing resources the bulk of our population can afford
and has available.</TE>
<TE>   Eleanor Jackson</TE>
<TE>   Palm Springs</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In light of all the recent news stories on proposed regime change
in the Middle East as a path to a more stable and ultimately peaceful
world, I would urge our politicians in this election season to
consider nonviolent public health and micro-credit solutions as
counter-terrorist measures instead.</TE>
<TE>   As a family physician working in community clinics in Los Angeles
County, as well as in medically underserved areas in Latin America,
the Balkans and South Africa, I would like to see Congress (1) tackle
the domestic terror that my uninsured patients here in California
feel when faced with tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills,
by sponsoring a plan for national health insurance in the U.S., and
(2) enable the very poor in developing countries to transform their
lives from desperation to hope with loans as small as $50 to $100 for
small-business ventures, by expanding support for international
micro-enterprise programs.</TE>

<LD>Re "L.A. Teacher Awarded British Honor," Oct. 29: Rafe Esquith's kids
are as wonderful as he says. Last August we were in Ashland for the
Oregon Shakespeare Festival the same time Esquith was there with
about 40 youngsters. The children, responsible for their schedules,
tickets, spending money and behavior, are organized in groups of
four. When one such group saw a festival employee accidentally tip
over a container while transferring trash, they ran across the street
to pick up the mess.</LD>
<LD>   Anecdotes such as this mean more to Esquith than most of the
awards. Too bad his own school district fails to recognize him.
Esquith works from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., during which time students
-- even those not in his own class -- are welcome to come into his
room for tutoring, to learn a musical instrument or to work on
Shakespeare. He lives his motto: Work hard. Be nice. There are no
shortcuts.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So! Esquith is an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the
British Empire. What empire? Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands and
Northern Ireland, where almost 50% of the population wants the
British out of there. Americans should not debase themselves, and
their country -- a republic -- by accepting these ridiculous
"honors."</TE>

<HD>Let Mammoth Remain a Low-Key Place to Ski</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bravo and thank you for your Oct. 26 editorial, "Look Closely,
Mammoth." I have skied at Mammoth for more than 40 years, and I love
the mountain. In the winter of 1960-61, Mammoth Mountain boasted one
day lodge, the inn, three double chairlifts, a T-bar lift and a rope
tow. The town of Mammoth Lakes was an informal collection of ordinary
motels, a few eating places, a couple of gas stations, a liquor
store, a small market, a couple of ski shops and a motley assortment
of cabins.</LD>
<LD>   Winter visitors came to ski. They cared more about the fit of
their boots than the fashion of their Bogners. No one -- and I mean
no one -- sashayed around town in mink at night.</LD>
<LD>   In the last four decades the mountain facilities have expanded to
include four day lodges, more than two dozen chairlifts and a
two-stage gondola lift. Earth-moving and tree removal have improved
access and expanded trails over much of the sprawling ski area. The
town has grown as well, with the addition of retail shops, a Vons
supermarket, a movie theater, upscale restaurants, fast-food outlets,
more motels and an assortment of condominium complexes and
single-family residences.</LD>
<TE>   I would not call Mammoth an unravished bride. She's been ravished
aplenty. However, that is no excuse for transforming her into a
bloated dowager expanding her squat in the fragile wilderness and
spreading environmental havoc all around her.</TE>
<TE>   I believe I speak for many old Mammoth hands who love her for the
skiing, who are willing to make the long, scenic drive to visit
Mammoth and who neither need nor want easy airline access to a
see-and-be-seen forum for the display of fashion, jewels and selves.</TE>

<TE>   Why spend my ski vacation money in a third-rate local resort like
Mammoth when I can spend it in world-class facilities in Vail and
Aspen in Colorado?</TE>

<LD>Re "MTA's Unique Traffic Plan," Oct. 24: A high-occupancy vehicle
lane would have a huge negative impact on the toy, seafood and
produce businesses in the eastern part of downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA must not forget about the vibrant downtown industrial and
manufacturing community that needs these streets for trucks. This
area, Central City East, provides most of the produce and seafood
that is eaten throughout Los Angeles County. Our trucks must be able
to get into and out of downtown quickly because of the perishable
nature of our products. Putting an HOV lane on these streets would be
disastrous and in direct conflict with the historical nature of this
community.</LD>
<LD>   We also represent the emerging toy district, a wonderful urban
wholesale shopping district with hundreds of businesses that has
grown tremendously over the last four years. It would be a shame if
the HOV lane were to go down either San Pedro or 4th streets and
divide this thriving shopping area.</LD>

<LD>Re "Will Bratton Keep His Vow?" editorial, Oct. 28, in which you
mistakenly characterize DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) as a
failure and recommend that incoming Chief William Bratton not support
it, I would point to the latest research findings on the new DARE
program. The University of Akron and the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation just recently released initial results from the most
comprehensive drug prevention evaluation ever undertaken.</LD>
<LD>   The findings show improvements in students' decision-making
skills, drug refusal skills and belief that drug use is socially
inappropriate.</LD>
<LD>   What is most exciting is the fact that the new DARE curriculum
performed better compared with control-group schools that offered
other drug education programs.</LD>
<TE>   I would hope that your newspaper will report these findings and
support prevention and education efforts, which are the long-term
solutions to the drug abuse and gang violence problems in our
community.</TE>

<LD>Re "Tibet Issue Is Ripe for Solving," Opinion, Oct. 27: I agree with
Orville Schell that President Bush missed a rare opportunity of being
a mediator in seeking a peaceful solution to the Tibet issue when he
entertained the Chinese leader at his Texas ranch.</LD>
<LD>   However, I cannot see how he could have and why he would have done
so. Not only would Bush's obsession with Saddam Hussein be a factor,
but he needs China's support more than China needs his -- on Iraq
issues, Korea issues and, of course, Taiwan.</LD>
<LD>   What really would be the quid pro quo? Would China agree to grant
even limited autonomy to Tibet on the Dalai Lama's terms, which is
unacceptable to many Tibetans, without demanding American
acquiescence in the takeover of Taiwan? Chinese leaders are not known
for their magnanimity.</LD>

<HD>Verdicts on 'Suing to Settle'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I started to do the predictable slow burn until I got to the truly
outrageous part of "Lawyers Who Sue to Settle" (Oct. 26) -- that by a
2-1 decision the 2nd District Court of Appeal put the burden of proof
on the defendant to prove that a substance is not dangerous. This is
a fallacy in logic so blatant that one would almost have to fault
L.A. attorney Morse Mehrban if he didn't take advantage of this
judicial incompetence.</LD>
<LD>   This is akin to saying, "Prove space aliens don't exist, or pay me
$20,000." If somehow I could comb the universe and turn over every
rock, finding no evidence of aliens, how would I prove they weren't
hiding from me? Or that they don't dematerialize when someone is
looking for them? How many and what kind of tests could a couple of
dentists perform to prove that small amounts of mercury don't cause
harm to anybody, under any circumstances, either now or in the
future? Can't be done. Just pay the toll and try to dodge the next
judicial speed trap.</LD>
<TE>   But the real villain in this article is the public, which voted
for Proposition 65 without ever looking at the damage to California
businesses. It's a lot more than the cost of a little sign by the
front door. And Mehrban's activities are just the nickel-and-dime
stuff. Let's hope the public will at least partially atone for this
mistake by voting out these judges who seemed to have slept through
their freshman logic class.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am a practicing attorney greatly troubled by your article. My
clients are mostly small businesses, like the victims of the lawsuits
you described.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 65, Mehrban's favorite legal weapon, was intended to
provide a clean environment and healthy food. However, Mehrban's
lawsuits produce only warning labels no one reads and a paycheck for
himself, paid for by the very consumers Mehrban was supposed to have
been protecting.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all the lawyers I know work very hard to benefit our
clients. But it's easy for the public to think that all lawyers are
as cynical as Mehrban, even while our politicians fail to reform laws
that encourage the kind of legal piracy you describe. The result is
declining public respect for lawyers, while bad laws stay on the
books.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Gunderson</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mehrban suffers from a condition found all too often in his
profession: lack of ethics. Lawyers have robbed billions from
industry and government, and the people who end up paying for this
are the taxpayers and consumers. From the little $2,000 workers'
compensation claim that will cost $10,000 to defend and has no merit
to the civil rights suits that make sure business pays wages and
offers promotions based on race and sex rather than merit, we all
lose in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   These lawyers have helped to create a society of people who
believe that whatever happens to them is the responsibility of
others. I'm sure that there are almost as many hard-working,
dedicated lawyers who are just as filled with outrage at this
situation as I am. Perhaps with their help we can return to respect
for the profession that is supposed to defend our rights and not
abuse them.</TE>
<TE>   Judy McLaughlin</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am a practicing attorney in the area of children's rights. Your
article regarding Mehrban made me ashamed. Nowhere does he
communicate any benefit he has obtained for the public, whether
through his efforts as counsel or through the nonprofit organization
led by his mother. There are many hard-working and dedicated
attorneys in our community who have made great efforts to both raise
the standards of the legal profession and confer legal benefits on
the community. Why not profile them?</TE>

<LD>It is the height of hypocrisy that our government, which is supposed
to be free of imposing one religion on every individual regardless of
his or her beliefs, does it daily in the arena of medical research.
This issue is raised in "A Matter of Life, Ethics" (Oct. 29). If my
religion does not believe that an embryo is a life until birth (or to
simplify, viability), how can it be ethical to sacrifice a precious
4-year-old child because the government won't allow selection of an
embryo that could save his life? The embryos that are not selected
are not humans (at least not to everybody).</LD>
<LD>   These "do-gooders" affect me because they virtually stopped
stem-cell research, which holds great promise for those of us who
suffer from multiple sclerosis. Would these people only remember that
one great teaching: Do unto others as you would have them do unto
you.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Stahl</LD>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There are so many difficult and conflicting issues that arise
between supporting the new scientific discoveries and preserving the
ethics and moral values of an individual. Many people would disagree
with the new procedures of embryo science. Their argument would be
that they are immoral. But if the tables were turned and this new
medical breakthrough would be the only hope of saving the life of
your beloved child, would your opinion change? Morals -- or giving
life to an innocent child with a promising future? Think about it.</TE>

<LD>Re "Chances Fade for Upset in House," Oct. 28: I resent political
scientist Gary Jacobson's characterization of the near 50-50 balance
of power in the House and Senate as "an accurate reflection of an
underlying lack of consensus." Quite to the contrary, it strikes me
as an obvious and unavoidable equilibrium that is sure to result from
a two-party system where each party abandons its core values and
squabbles over the votes of the so-called "mainstream" voter.</LD>
<LD>   Every election cycle, each party attempts the absurd calculus of
trying to average the political view of the few Americans who
actually bother to turn out and vote on election day. Granted, the
two mainstream parties approach that average from different
directions, but that's still a formula guaranteed to create a 50-50
split in the balance of power.</LD>
<LD>   The solution? We need to get the majority of Americans who don't
bother to vote out on election day. We need to get more Americans to
want to serve their country by running for political office. We also
need to get our politicians to stand up for principles instead of
constantly campaigning for reelection. That should work until the
next equilibrium is achieved, anyway. In the long run we may just
have to rethink the two-party system and abandon it for something
better.</LD>

<TE>   We disagree with David A. Holtzman (letter, Oct. 28) on voting
with the new touch-screen machines. Last week, we voted at the
Redondo Beach Public Library and found the experience to be nothing
but efficient and pleasant. The officials were more than eager to
demonstrate how to vote using a sample machine and sample ballot, and
the actual voting process was easy, quick and user-friendly. This
could be the answer to the expense of absentee ballots and those
frustrating hanging chads.</TE>

<TE>   On Nov. 5, once again we will have the opportunity to celebrate
the historical triumph of liberty over tyranny by casting our votes.
If you are reading this letter, chances are that you are among one of
those "most likely voters." However, I would like to respectfully ask
you to consider, this election day, finding a friend or a relative
who is not planning to vote and talking him or her into
participating. Even better, take the person along with you to the
polling place and maybe for a drink afterward. If he or she asks why
you care, you may consider responding with any of the following:</TE>
<TE>   Tell your friend that his or her vote is paying the ultimate
respect to the memories of all those who died in two world wars, in
Korea and in Vietnam, fighting Nazism and communism. Tell him that
his walk into the voting booth is rekindling the crushed spirits of
those who marched into Tiananmen Square. Tell her that the sound of
opening the curtains at the voting booths will be the most heavenly
music to the tired ears of Saudi women under veils. Tell him that the
drink you will share together afterward will be a celebration of the
human spirit and individual freedom and will be the strongest blow to
those ignorant and intolerant souls who planned and celebrated 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, if you know someone who you think may need to hear any
of these reasons but you feel that he or she may think of you as a
corny and naive person who doesn't know how the real world works,
then please leave a copy of this letter somewhere for him or her to
see.</TE>

<TE>   I want to express my disappointment in your Oct. 27 Voting Guide
in the California section. By limiting candidate profiles beyond one
or two words to only Republican and Democrat candidates from
lieutenant governor on down to insurance commissioner, you have
effectively embraced the two-party system that holds our citizenry
hostage.</TE>
<TE>   And as if your barometer for public sentiment were on the fritz,
you chose to provide key issue stances from only Gov. Gray Davis and
Bill Simon, who together probably draw about as much zeal from
California voters as a trip to the dentist. If ever there was a
chance to elect or write in a third-party candidate, it is now, which
is why it is so unfortunate that The Times failed to capitalize on
this opportunity for inspired democracy.</TE>

<TE>   The California "govern by proposition" tendency has now gone
beyond its logical conclusion to the absurd. We are now actually
budgeting by acclaim! I have a great idea. Let's do the state budget
the same way we can donate to the United Way: When we pay our taxes,
we individually apportion our taxes based on our individual opinions
and priorities.</TE>
<TE>   The logical result of this will be that without legislators
handling the budget, we don't need 'em anymore.</TE>

<LD>Re "Russia's Use of Gas Focuses Attention on Chemical Agents in
U.S.," Oct. 29: I was horrified when I found out that the Russian
government had used chemical agents. I thought it had made great
strides toward making itself better. But now it seems as if it has
regressed. I hope that our government is not thinking about using
chemical warfare, because it is absolutely wrong. Chemical warfare is
only used by terrorists and immoral governments.</LD>
<LD>   I am not convinced about how much our government is against
chemical warfare. The laws governing it have a thick gray zone, and
the government can use this sort of loophole to implement the use of
chemicals.</LD>

<TE>   At first I thought Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman was engaging
in typical government doublespeak when he referred to a subclass of
chemical weapons as "calming agents." But then I thought, hey, maybe
the guy's not so far off the mark. Last time I checked, death by gas
certainly qualified as the ultimate "calm."</TE>

<TE>   The Russians' use of a narcotic gas in the Moscow theater incident
should be likened to the first flight of the Wright brothers. Just as
their primitive effort at powered flight gave rise to our present
worldwide use of aircraft, so does the use of various forms of gases
in various situations seem a certainty. Without debating whether this
is a "good" thing, we should at least be cognizant of the fact that
more gases are likely to be developed, because what is the difference
between a weapon of mass destruction and a weapon of limited
destruction? Has a terrible genie been released from its bottle?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most important measures on the ballot, L.A. County Measure
B, is getting very little attention. Yet it is one that may seriously
affect our families, our neighbors and ourselves. The number of
trauma centers in L.A.. County has shrunk from 22 to 13 since 1985.
In the event of trauma injury or heart attack, minutes, even seconds,
make the difference between life and death. Should more trauma
centers be forced to close, every person in L.A. County will be at
greater risk when suffering a critical injury.</LD>
<LD>   Measure B will create a stable flow of revenue to preserve the
county's trauma and emergency medical network. Remember, even if you
have insurance or resources to cover these emergency expenses, it
will be of no value if paramedics can't get you to an available
trauma center or ER. Vote yes on Measure B.</LD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and four City Council members said
Friday they are preparing to go to court to challenge the
environmental study for the Ahmanson Ranch development as inadequate
if it is approved by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Dennis Zine introduced a motion Friday that, if
approved by the council next week, would direct the city attorney to
"immediately challenge the legal adequacy" of the development's
environmental study if it is certified as written. The motion was
seconded by council members Tom La Bonge, Wendy Greuel and Jack
Weiss.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not going to let the profits of a commercial developer
interfere with the enjoyment of life for the people in the west San
Fernando Valley," Hahn said. "This is an example of City Hall
listening to neighborhoods."</LD>
<TE>   A Ventura County panel on Wednesday sent a revised environmental
study to the county Planning Commission, which will consider it this
month.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is then expected to send the study to the Ventura
County Board of Supervisors for consideration in December.</TE>
<TE>   The $2-billion golf course community immediately west of the Los
Angeles city and county border would include 3,050 homes and generate
45,000 vehicle trips daily, Hahn said. The project was first approved
in 1992, but construction has been delayed by litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the environmental study has been revised, Hahn said the
result of a decade of delays is that the study is too old, and a new
one should be done. Previous legal challenges by the city have
failed, but Hahn said new information, including the possible
presence of ground water pollution on the property, warrant new
review.</TE>
<TE>   "With Ventura County prepared to vote on this project, the city of
Los Angeles has no alternative but to prepare to address this
development by legal means," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Zine vowed to camp out to block earthmovers from beginning work on
the site, but said the legal option also should be pursued.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Ventura Freeway is already a "parking lot" most days.
"There is no way we can add 45,000 cars to that congested roadway,"
Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's announcement Friday was seen by some secession leaders as
an attempt to capitalize on the unpopular Ahmanson Ranch project
before voters go to the polls Tuesday to decide if the Valley will
break away from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of litigation by Los Angeles officials was welcomed by
Tsilah Burman, executive director of the group Rally to Save Ahmanson
Ranch and one of a dozen activists who joined Hahn at a news
conference Friday in his City Hall office.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something Ventura County will have to take notice of,"
Burman said. "I think it's important for them to know the city is
ready to sue."</TE>
<TE>   John Flynn, chairman of the Ventura County Board of Supervisors,
said his county is trying to make sure the project is properly
studied. "We are doing the best we can," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisor added that he is not concerned about Hahn's threat
of litigation, because nothing has been filed. "He has to make up his
mind about what he wants to do," Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Washington Mutual, in a statement issued Friday, said it
is confident it will win any challenge.</TE>

<HD>AQMD Puts Off Ban on Solvent</HD>
<DH>A loud protest by dry cleaners pays off. The air quality
board says it also will consider less stringent restrictions on
chemical 'perc.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blitzed by a well-organized lobbying effort, Southern California air
quality officials Friday postponed a decision to ban a solvent widely
used by dry cleaners, but showed some interest in a more lenient
measure drafted by the chemical industry and supported by the Davis
administration.</LD>
<LD>   In a raucous, all-day hearing, nearly 600 dry cleaners converged
on the regional clean-air agency's Diamond Bar headquarters to defend
the chemical they call "perc." They arrived by the busload wearing
black armbands and waving protest banners. Many are Korean Americans,
who charged that a ban on perchloroethylene would discriminate
against them and would harm their businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The South Coast Air Quality Management District governing board
was poised to enact the nation's first ban on the solvent, which
makes clothes crisp and clean, but has been linked to cancer and
other health problems. Instead, the board took no action after the
public hearing and will revisit the matter at its Dec. 6 meeting.</LD>
<TE>   At the outset of Friday's meeting, Cynthia Verdugo-Peralta of
Yorba Linda, Gov. Gray Davis' appointee to the local air board,
proposed a less stringent measure, which the board will consider next
month. That alternative, which allows the continued use of perc with
some restrictions, was written by attorneys representing industry
trade groups and major chemical companies.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks leading up to the meeting, board members said they
received numerous calls, faxes and requests for interviews from
mom-and-pop dry cleaners, trade associations and a group representing
perc makers such as Dow Chemical Co. and PPG Industries.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never gotten so many phone calls," said board member and
Riverside attorney Jane Carney.</TE>
<TE>   The industry-backed plan would give dry cleaners until January
2007 to switch to machines that emit roughly 40% fewer perc fumes.
And rather than ban the substance, the proposal would allow dry
cleaners to continue to emit perc, provided the fumes do not increase
the risk of cancer for nearby residents to more than 25 cases in a
million.</TE>
<TE>   That standard currently applies to other businesses, including
metal-plating shops, oil refineries and manufacturing plants. Dry
cleaners say they want to be treated the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want you to treat small businesses in the basin as you do
the biggest," said Bob Wyman, a Los Angeles attorney representing the
dry cleaners.</TE>
<TE>   Dry cleaners say they've already reduced their perc emissions by
80% in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "We're being victimized again. We're being called the polluters
and the killers and the cause of all the problems with bad air and
polluted water," said Charles J. Kim, head of the Korean American
Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   A representative of Gov. Davis warned the air quality board that a
ban on perc could have dire consequences for small business.</TE>
<TE>   "The fragile nature of small business in California is such that
the imposition of the rule will have a very significant impact on
businesses in the state. We're trying everything we can to hold small
businesses together," said H. Cooke Sunoo, interim director of the
governor's Small Business Reform Task Force.</TE>
<TE>   Under the original proposal, 2,089 dry cleaners would be required
to gradually stop using perc over the next 17 years and switch to
machines that use other types of solvents or water and detergents to
treat garments.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those technologies are already used in New York City, San
Francisco and Germany. In the Los Angeles region, 20% of new dry
cleaners applying for permits say they will use alternatives to perc.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality officials estimate that 850 tons of perc are emitted
annually, ranking it as one of the most prevalent air toxins in the
region. The chemical has been linked to cancer of the kidney, liver
and breast. The proposal to ban perc won support from
environmentalists, health experts and some scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Carmichael, executive director of the Coalition for Clean Air,
chided the board for considering an industry plan that would
perpetuate the use of perc.</TE>
<TE>   "This is simply offensive," Carmichael said. "It suggests this
board trusts the chemical industry more than it trusts its own staff.
You'd rather see an industry continue to use a chemical known to
cause cancer than phase it out."</TE>

<HD>Alfred L. Atherton, 80; Career Foreign Service Officer,
Mideast Expert</HD>

<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alfred L. Atherton Jr., a Foreign Service officer and Middle East
expert who helped in the negotiations that led to the 1978 Camp David
peace accords between Israel and Egypt, died Wednesday at a hospital
in Washington, D.C., of complications related to cancer surgery. He
was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Atherton served 38 years in the Foreign Service before retiring in
1985. His career also included four years as ambassador to Egypt and
four years as assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South
Asian affairs. In this role, he directed one of the State
Department's most critical sections, with responsibility related to
not only Arab-Israeli disputes, but also the hostility between India
and Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   As a Middle East peace negotiator, he was said to have been able
to understand and articulate the historic grievances of Israelis and
Palestinians, and to have had the trust of both sides. In 1978,
President Carter named him ambassador-at-large for Middle East
negotiations, and Atherton spent two years as a shuttle diplomat,
traveling between Middle Eastern capitals.</LD>
<TE>   As ambassador to Egypt from 1979 to 1983, Atherton presided over
what then was the largest U.S. diplomatic mission in the world, with
a staff of 872 Americans and 500 Egyptians. After the Camp David
accords, hundreds of Americans were dispatched to Cairo to help
administer $1.5 billion a year in military and economic assistance
that flowed from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1981, midway through Atherton's tenure as ambassador,
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who had agreed to make peace with
Israel, was assassinated by a commando group led by an Egyptian Army
lieutenant.</TE>
<TE>   Atherton, a resident of Washington, was born in Pittsburgh. He
graduated from Harvard University and served in the Army in Europe
during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Foreign Service in 1947, and in early assignments
served in Germany, Syria and India, in addition to postings in
Washington. He received a master's degree in economics from UC
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   In the Foreign Service, he had a reputation as a tireless worker
who routinely was in his office by 7:30 a.m. and rarely left before 8
at night. In his personal life, Atherton, who was known as "Roy," was
a camera enthusiast who took hundreds of slide photographs at family
gatherings and in his travels around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife of 56 years, Betty Wylie Atherton of
Washington; three children; three grandchildren; and two
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Offers Health Bailout</HD>
<DH>But the initial proposal of $150 million falls far short of
what's needed, county officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein and Lisa Richardson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal health officials have proposed giving Los Angeles County $150
million to bolster its ailing health-care system -- an offer that
falls far short of the $1.4 billion requested to avert massive cuts,
county officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But federal authorities stressed Friday that negotiations are not
over and that no agreement had been reached.</LD>
<LD>   The $150-million offer would not be enough to prevent the closing
of two full-service public hospitals -- Harbor-UCLA and Olive
View-UCLA medical centers -- according to a memorandum sent Friday by
the L.A. County health department to county supervisors' deputies.</LD>
<TE>   About $50 million of the federal money would come from a
long-delayed lawsuit settlement with private hospitals over
reimbursement rates. The remaining $100 million would come out of a
program that gives extra money to California hospitals that care for
the poor, the memo said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Scully, the federal official in charge of Medicare and
Medicaid, plans to visit L.A. on Wednesday to tour Harbor-UCLA and
other public hospitals. He also plans to meet county officials to
discuss their requests for help.</TE>
<TE>   A day before Scully's visit, county residents will vote on a
ballot initiative that would raise property taxes to pump $168
million in new money into the county's emergency and trauma-care
network. If Measure B is approved Tuesday, the owner of a
1,400-square-foot home would pay about $42 more annually.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors said they hope Scully is coming with an open
mind. Some said that, if he has settled on $150 million in one-time
funding as his final offer, he might as well stay home.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not interested in one-time money. It's not a solution to
our problem -- it basically delays the inevitable," said Supervisor
Zev Yaroslavsky. "If anybody believes a one-time check is going to
solve our problems, he is sadly mistaken."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich agreed that more federal and state
money is needed. But he said the county also needs to dramatically
overhaul its public health system.</TE>
<TE>   "I would doubt any federal official who would offer $150 million
-- it would be an embarrassment to make such an irresponsible
suggestion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Don Knabe, however, said the county "is looking for
dollars to save lives, and we should take them as we can get them."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, the county's director of health services,
said he is optimistic that the county can secure more long-term help.</TE>
<TE>   "We put forward an offer they thought was way too much,"
Garthwaite said. "They came back with an offer that we think is way
too little.... We obviously would like to get as much money as we
can, because we see a tremendous need here."</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Knabe reversed his opposition to Measure B, calling
it a necessary step to avert disastrous cuts to the county
health-care system.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Knabe and Antonovich voted against putting the initiative
on the ballot. At the time, Knabe said the measure lacked important
fiscal safeguards.</TE>
<TE>   Knabe said his change of heart was, in part, in response to the
board's 4-1 decision Tuesday to begin the closing of Rancho Los
Amigos National Rehabilitation Center, a step taken over his
objections.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped the tax would give the county breathing room and
offer a chance to save the center.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich remains opposed to Measure B and drafted the ballot
arguments against it.</TE>

<HD>FAA Says It Controls Airspace</HD>
<DH>Agency's notice may affect Huntington Beach's attempt to
ban planes that tow banners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what could be a blow to Huntington Beach's ban on banner-towing
airplanes, the FAA has clarified that it has ultimate jurisdiction
over airspace, according to evidence introduced Friday in a federal
court challenge to the city's ban.</LD>
<LD>   Huntington Beach had joined Honolulu in enacting bans. But the
Federal Aviation Administration's clarification states that it -- not
cities -- controls air traffic.</LD>
<LD>   "The FAA just changed their regulations and are asserting their
jurisdiction over banner towing," said Greg Cunningham, executive
director for the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, which challenged the
city's ordinance on 1st Amendment grounds.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Court Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler was not persuaded
that the notice, which is in draft form, could be construed as a new
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   No FAA representatives were present in court. But an FAA spokesman
said the changes have been in effect since the Oct. 7 notice was sent
to flight-standards district offices nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Stotler set a hearing for Dec. 6, giving both sides time to
determine the FAA's authority and intent. A temporary restraining
order against the ban was extended until the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We barely got this notice by the FAA sent to us by opposing
counsel yesterday," said Sarah Lazarus, Huntington Beach deputy city
attorney. "We have not had a chance to fully understand what it
means."</TE>
<TE>   The notice, which came out of the FAA's Flight Standards Service,
states that it was written to clarify an earlier FAA order that
included statements "that have been misinterpreted" to recognize the
ability of state and local governments to police banner towing.</TE>
<TE>   Beach communities have been stymied in their efforts to curb plane
noise and banners because airspace is controlled by the FAA, which
has long supported the right of the banner-towing planes to operate.</TE>
<TE>   But a recent federal appeals court ruling upholding Honolulu's ban
on aerial advertising had given coastal towns hope that they could
impose regulations, if not an outright ban.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach council members passed the ordinance because of
complaints the airplanes were a noisy eyesore. The ordinance was to
have taken effect Oct. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham said he believes the FAA has taken action because it
didn't want new flight restrictions by many cities, "all different
from each other," which would hinder navigation.</TE>
<TE>   He represents an antiabortion group that is waging a free-speech
battle against the city. "This most likely will end in the city
repealing its ordinance," Cunningham said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 46-year-old Santa Monica man has been convicted of murdering his
father, with whom he hijacked a Soviet jetliner 32 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Albert Victor White, formerly known as Algirdas Brazinskas, was
found guilty in the Jan. 5 bludgeoning death of 77-year-old Pranas
Brazinskas. He will be sentenced Dec. 6 and faces 16 years to life in
prison.</LD>
<LD>   In 1970, father and son hijacked an Aeroflot plane over the Soviet
Union and flew it to Turkey. The father said he was trying to escape
the Soviet Union because he faced death as a member of a Lithuanian
resistance group. In a gun battle with guards on board, a flight
attendant was killed. After spending some time in prison in Turkey,
the two made their way to the United States. They had lived in Santa
Monica since 1980.</LD>

<LD>For billionaire financier Eli Broad, it was just an off-hand remark
-- but it would change the course of the nation's second-largest

and, after an evaluation process by the school board, became head of
the Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the suggestive power of one of the city's richest men on
the school district. Already active in other cultural and political
causes, Broad -- with his long-time friend, former Mayor Richard
Riordan -- has exerted unusual influence in recent years by funding
pet educational programs around the country through foundations and
by selecting and financing school board candidates in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Broad's efforts to persuade Theodore R. Mitchell,
president of Occidental College, to run against L.A. Unified school
board incumbent David Tokofsky next April show that he is continuing
his controversial work in education .</TE>
<TE>   Several people present at a special meeting of the Occidental
Board of Trustees on Wednesday reported that Mitchell had said Broad
would give the college $10 million for a charter school leadership
institute if he would agree to run. Broad said discussions about the
possible gift had not been related to the challenge to Tokofsky.</TE>
<TE>   "I regret the fact [Mitchell is] not running for the school board.
There was no linkage between the two," Broad said in an interview
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, who ultimately decided not to run, agreed that Broad had
not presented the two issues as a quid pro quo. Mitchell has
repeatedly declined to say what he told Occidental trustees in a
confidential phone conference call on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he suggested that the donation had been unrelated to
his seeking a school board position; he repeated that in a campus
e-mail on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times late Friday, however, Mitchell said
he had considered the two proposals "as a package."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm at work every day trying to bring resources to the college to
support our core work," Mitchell said. "In addition to hoping that I
would be able to serve the children of Los Angeles, which was, of
course, my primary concern, I hoped that a run for school board, if
undertaken, would have signaled to funders around the country that
Occidental is committed from the very top to school reform."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said those potential donors included the Broad
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Broad said he involved himself in education because he was
dismayed at the lack of progress in public schools during the last
two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "People think I'm nuts" and they ask: " 'Why don't you go and play
golf? Buy a place in Aspen?' " Broad said in an interview Friday. "I
think K-12 education is the biggest problem America has today."</TE>
<TE>   Some educators and civic leaders welcome Broad's efforts to reform
a school district viewed as stifled by bureaucracy, mismanaged and
harming the welfare of 730,000 children.</TE>
<TE>   But the influence of Broad and Riordan has triggered concern about
the district's autonomy, even among some of the school board members
supported by them, such as Genethia Hudley Hayes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't ever think it's a good thing for anybody to have control
of institutions that are supposed to be public," said Hayes. "Not
Eli, not Riordan, not ... labor."</TE>
<TE>   But Hayes, who said she has not been influenced by either man,
said she is glad that Broad has become such a passionate advocate for
public education.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Eli gets a bad rap because he's wealthy," she said. "I
think people are suspicious of rich folk."</TE>
<TE>   Broad recently has become involved in other school districts
around the state as well, including San Diego, where he contributed
money to two candidates in Tuesday's school board election. Broad's
foundation has also worked with Supt. Alan Bersin in San Diego to set
up a principal training academy.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also has established dozens of other programs
promoting corporate-style school management in cities from Seattle to
Atlanta. They include training for superintendents and board members,
support for charter school development and demonstration projects
such as a merit pay plan in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   And Broad's foundation has established a program that awards cash
prizes to urban school districts that it considers the best in the
nation. Last month it gave $500,000 to Houston's schools and $125,000
to four other districts, including Long Beach and Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Broad, 69, a Brentwood resident, made his initial fortune as a
home builder and dramatically expanded his wealth in the 1990s with
the financial services company, SunAmerica. He has sold SunAmerica
but remains its chairman. He has been a powerful force in the
cultural life of the city for years, supporting museum renovations
and advocating for redevelopment of Grand Avenue, among other
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan shared his concerns about education, and the two formed an
alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Broad gave $250,000 to the Coalition for Kids, which Riordan
helped found to support newcomer reform candidates like Hayes and
Caprice Young, who helped create a new majority on the board.</TE>
<TE>   Broad was eventually appointed to the superintendent review
committee that short-listed Romer.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said he is grateful for Broad's involvement and said that,
in their monthly discussions, Broad and Riordan never try to dictate
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, Eli has strong opinions, and we've had some very testy
times with both the mayor and Eli, but I respect them," Romer said.
"That's what happens when strong people get involved in solving
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Young, the school board president, says she talks to Broad about
once every two months to seek his counsel, mainly on school building
matters. "I try to steal as much of his time as I can. He's smart and
gives good advice."</TE>
<TE>   Young said she asked for Broad's help to promote her agenda during
a redistricting campaign last year. The Coalition for Kids donated
$30,000 to hire a lobbying firm, Rose &amp; Kindel, to push the electoral
map Young favored and won.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, Broad assigned an employee of his foundation to work
in Hayes' office when she was president of the school board. Broad
said Hayes had asked him for help and he provided it.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, when the California Teachers Assn. backed two school
board candidates Broad perceives as hostile to Supt. Bersin, Broad
spent $60,000 on opposition fliers for next week's election.</TE>
<TE>   Broad's intervention has rankled board member Frances O'Neill
Zimmerman, who is not up for reelection this year.</TE>
<TE>   "He's dabbling in social policy with all his money, and affecting
change with it, but it's not necessarily good change, and it's not
really school reform," Zimmerman said. "It's basically a business
agenda for reshaping the public school system."</TE>
<TE>   Broad said his efforts in public education have nothing to do with
making money.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always been a political giver," Broad said. "Once I became
involved in education, I had a proclivity for people who were
interested in education."</TE>

<HD>Murder Defendant a Gang Pawn, Lawyer Argues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murder defendant Bridget Callahan was portrayed Friday as an
unwitting follower of a white supremacist gang, and had no intention
of helping in the slaying of a 17-year-old girl four years ago in a
Ventura motel room.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Joseph O'Neill said in closing arguments in Callahan's
murder trial that his client sought to gain power and prestige
through her association with violent men who "used and abused women"
and ruled by intimidation.</LD>
<LD>   "She was not the brightest bulb in the bunch here, and she had
gone to individuals who are similar to her," O'Neill told the Ventura
County Superior Court jury. "This is a girl who desperately wanted to
belong."</LD>
<TE>   But Deputy Atty. Gen. Michael Katz told jurors that Callahan knew
what she was doing every step of the way, embracing the racist
skinhead subculture and knowingly participating in the October 1998
beating and stabbing death of high school student Nichole Hendrix of
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "She was an adult, she knew what she was doing," Katz said.
"Bridget Callahan didn't really want to change. She liked being a
devotee of the [gang]."</TE>
<TE>   Callahan, a 30-year old Ventura resident, faces one count of
first-degree murder with allegations that the slaying was
gang-related and occurred during a robbery and kidnapping. She faces
25 years to life in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Hendrix was drugged and kidnapped by her
friend Callahan and skinheads David Ziesmer, 29, and Michael
Bridgeford, 25, because they wanted to sell stolen goods in her
possession.</TE>
<TE>   When she woke up in a Thompson Boulevard motel room, Hendrix
called her mother.</TE>
<TE>   But Ziesmer and Bridgeford thought she was reporting them to
police and decided to kill her, Katz has said.</TE>
<TE>   After Hendrix was slain, her body was stuffed into a trash can
filled with wet cement and dumped into the Ventura County back
country. When it was recovered six months later, animals had dragged
away most of the remains.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan is the first of the three suspects to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   During closing arguments, O'Neill honed in on his theory that
Callahan was a hapless victim of the gang, comparing her attraction
to Ziesmer to that of a young boy's attraction to a snake pit in a
zoo.</TE>
<TE>   "Miss Callahan became very fascinated with Mr. Ziesmer, who was
the biggest snake in the pit," O'Neill said. "When you're in that
pit, you're going to do whatever you have to do to survive."</TE>

<HD>Basic Facts Are Fluid for Water Board Candidate</HD>
<DH>Las Virgenes voters may have questions about Marcus Allen
Frishman. Answers are elusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a candidate for the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District board,
Marcus Allen Frishman would prefer to talk about water rates rather
than his age, job title or convictions for disturbing the peace and
auto theft.</LD>
<LD>   But, then again, it is a political campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Frishman, who ran unsuccessfully for the Calabasas City Council
last year, is hoping to unseat 16-year incumbent Glen Denis Peterson
in the race to represent Division 2 on the west Los Angeles County
water district board.</LD>
<TE>   Both candidates are campaigning on a promise to keep water rates
down amid fears that new development may translate into higher costs
for local homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   But the more immediate question voters will have to decide is: Who
is Marcus Allen Frishman? Or is it Marcus Allen De Rothschild, as it
appears on his driver's license?</TE>
<TE>   With Frishman, there are no easy answers, according to his
opponent, court records and Frishman himself.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the talkative, friendly, 40-something candidate
refuses to divulge his age. Court records say Frishman was born in
1959, while his 2000 voter registration form lists his birth year as
1964.</TE>
<TE>   "I never tell people my age," he said when asked about the
discrepancy. "I think it boxes you in."</TE>
<TE>   His job title also has been the source of some controversy.
Officially employed as chief deputy to state Board of Equalization
member Claude Parrish, Frishman's business cards refer to him as
"deputy board member."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson sued to stop the county registrar of voters from placing
Frishman's self-described occupation on Tuesday's ballot. The parties
settled the matter by agreeing that "state board member deputy" was
more accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Frishman, who has worked for Parrish for four years, said deputy
board member is the title he routinely uses because he is chief of
staff. He said it is printed on his state identification card.</TE>
<TE>   "My [actual] title is 'deputy to board member,' " he said. "I drop
the 'to' on my business card for grammatical sake."</TE>
<TE>   As for his criminal convictions, Frishman acknowledges some
problems in his past, but stresses that they were minor incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that Frishman has two criminal convictions, one
for disturbing the peace and the other for auto theft.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept a rental car too long," Frishman said, referring to the
latter case. "Technically, the charges were dismissed.... I paid no
fine. I paid no restitution."</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that in 1990 Frishman rented a BMW 325i in
Arizona, reported it stolen the next day and filed an insurance claim
for $1,000 worth of property left inside the car.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, police found the car -- and Frishman -- at a Beverly
Hills eatery. Frishman, who gave his name to police as Marcus Allen
De Rothschild, was charged with felony counts of grand theft,
insurance fraud and the unlawful taking of a vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded guilty to the last count in exchange for dismissal of
the other charges, records show. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail,
placed on three years' probation and ordered to pay $5,000 in
restitution. He never paid the restitution, records show.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the name De Rothschild, Frishman said that is how he
is identified on his driver's license. He said he picked the name
"out of the air" as a youngster.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an alias," he said. "When I was a kid, I did some acting
and some modeling. My driver's license says Marcus Frishman De
Rothschild. My full legal name is Marcus Allen Frishman. I have not
used the name [De Rothschild] since the mid- or early 1980s."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Frishman's felony conviction was retroactively reduced to
a misdemeanor. But Superior Court Judge Bernard J. Kamins rejected
Frishman's petition to expunge the conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Kamins agreed with the prosecutor's finding that Frishman's crime
"involved premeditation and sophistication," and also the probation
officer's conclusion that Frishman "knew exactly what he was doing,"
according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, Frishman acknowledged that the incident "was a bad
thing, a bad decision.... I was in college at the time."</TE>
<TE>   The second case involved a car-honking incident in 1992 that
escalated out of control, Frishman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at my girlfriend's house," he said, recalling the episode.
"I honked my horn. I woke some guy's baby up. He pounds my window as
hard as he can and rips off my antenna. I backed up so he wouldn't
touch my car. So it looks like I'm going to run him over."</TE>
<TE>   While still on probation in the auto theft case, Frishman was
charged with misdemeanor counts of assault with a deadly weapon and
disturbing the peace.</TE>
<TE>   In a plea bargain, he was convicted of disturbing the peace and
sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Frishman took so long to
complete his service -- 2 1/2 years -- that the court commissioner
assigned to the case threatened to throw him in jail for 60 days,
records show.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a public records check on Peterson, a 52-year-old
retired real estate agent, turned up only a minor traffic citation.
Of his opponent's record, Peterson said, "I fear for the district if
they have an ex-criminal at the helm."</TE>
<TE>   But Frishman remains confident. He said voters must decide what
they believe about him and whether his past is relevant in this
election.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never, ever misrepresented who I am," he said.</TE>

<HD>Busy 405 Offramp in O.C. to Be Closed for 2 Weeks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a race with the holiday season, construction crews closed a busy
San Diego Freeway offramp in Costa Mesa for two weeks Friday, forcing
drivers bound for South Coast Plaza and the city's biggest
entertainment venues to take a detour.</LD>
<LD>   Transportation officials said they sped up the timetable for work
on the Bristol Street offramp from the northbound San Diego Freeway
to ensure it is done before the holiday shopping season starts in
earnest later this month.</LD>
<LD>   The offramp was closed to allow Caltrans to build a long
transition road from the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway to the
northbound San Diego Freeway, eliminating dangerous weaving by
drivers trying to exit at Bristol while others merge into northbound
traffic. Also, an offramp will be added at Avenue of the Stars.
Barring complications, work is expected to be finished by Nov. 15.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, drivers headed for the mall, South Coast
Repertory, the Orange County Performing Arts Center and a variety of
hotels and restaurants, are being detoured to MacArthur Boulevard and
the Fairview Road/South Coast Drive exits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inconvenient," said Bobbi Kranitz of Coto de Caza, who
ordinarily takes Bristol to get to South Coast Plaza. "But I've been
here 18 years and always thought they should improve the offramp
because of all the traffic coming from the 55 Freeway."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Transportation Authority and Costa Mesa officials
said the closure did not appear to have much effect on rush-hour
traffic Friday morning. By lunchtime, however, motorists were
significantly backed up at the South Coast exit.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic engineers say the real test will be over the weekend, when
people go shopping or to the nearby restaurants and theaters.</TE>

<LD>   Transportation officials said they sped up the timetable for work
on the Bristol Street offramp from the northbound San Diego Freeway
to ensure it is done before the holiday shopping season starts in
earnest later this month.</LD>
<LD>   The offramp was closed to allow Caltrans to build a long
transition road from the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway to the
northbound San Diego Freeway, eliminating dangerous weaving by
drivers trying to exit at Bristol while others merge into northbound
traffic. Also, an offramp will be added at Avenue of the Stars.
Barring complications, work is expected to be finished by Nov. 15.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, drivers headed for the mall, South Coast
Repertory, the Orange County Performing Arts Center and hotels and
restaurants are being detoured to MacArthur Boulevard and the
Fairview Road/South Coast Drive exits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inconvenient," said Bobbi Kranitz of Coto de Caza, who
usually takes Bristol to get to the mall. "But I've been here 18
years and always thought they should improve the offramp because of
all the traffic coming from the 55 Freeway."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Transportation Authority and Costa Mesa officials
said the closure did not appear to have much effect on rush-hour
traffic Friday morning. By lunchtime, however, there was a major
backup at the South Coast exit.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic engineers say the real test will be this weekend, when
people go shopping or to the restaurants and theaters.</TE>
<TE>   The Bristol offramp is part of the $150-million project to better
link the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways by rebuilding ramps and
adding carpool connectors. The interchange is considered among the 10
busiest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The interchange work is one of several construction projects
between Euclid Street in Fountain Valley and the Costa Mesa Freeway
that have contributed to congestion and complicated travel for
motorists using the San Diego and Corona del Mar freeways in recent
months.</TE>
<TE>   Extensive work is proceeding on the San Diego Freeway at Harbor
Boulevard and Fairview Road, and along the Corona del Mar Freeway
from the San Diego Freeway to Birch Street in Newport Beach.
Completion is expected by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   With South Coast Plaza, John Wayne Airport and major offices
nearby, the San Diego Freeway through Costa Mesa and Irvine is one of
the most heavily traveled corridors in Orange County. An average of
433,000 vehicles use the San Diego-Costa Mesa freeways interchange
daily. South Coast Plaza attracts about 22 million visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   About 350,000 vehicle trips a day occur on the San Diego Freeway
north of the Corona del Mar Freeway. The Bristol offramp carried
8,000 cars an hour during peak travel times.</TE>
<TE>   "When all the work is done, the area will be transformed," said
Peter Naghavi, the manager of transportation services for Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   As an alternative to Bristol, motorists can use the MacArthur
Boulevard exit off the Costa Mesa Freeway. Bill Cecil of Yorba Linda
said he took the detour to get to South Coast Plaza on Friday and
found it to be a shorter trip than using the Bristol offramp. "No
problems," he said. "When everything is finished, it's going to be
great."</TE>
<TE>   For months before the closure, Caltrans and the OCTA conducted
extensive outreach to notify thousands of merchants, restaurants and
hotels in the area about the project. Electronic billboards and other
signs on the San Diego Freeway also helped inform motorists.</TE>
<TE>   "A ramp closure is never going to be a smooth situation for us,"
said Debra Gunn Downing, executive director of marketing for South
Coast Plaza. "But OCTA and Caltrans have been wonderful in getting
the information out to our retailers and to businesses in the area."</TE>
<TE>   When the Bristol offramp reopens, OCTA spokesman Michael Litschi
said, it will be south of the new connector from the Costa Mesa
Freeway to the north San Diego Freeway. "A 15-day closure is pretty
good for a significant project," Litschi said. "It will definitely
improve traffic in the long run."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Hopefuls Split Up</HD>
<DH>Council candidates in prospective city form like-minded
slates to boost their campaigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nita Lelyveld and Kristina Sauerwein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the beginning, candidates for a proposed Hollywood city council
trained and appeared at political events together, as if they were
allies. Their main focus: building support for Hollywood secession,
without which the five council seats will not exist.</LD>
<LD>   But as Tuesday's election drew closer, collegiality gave way to
competition.</LD>
<LD>   With four times as many candidates as there are council seats,
groups of contenders are banding together, forming slates to push
themselves and their causes. They are running at large for the
nonpartisan posts. If secession wins, the top five vote-getters will
take office. They will later select a mayor from their ranks.</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra, 54, who has spent more
than $2 million of his own money to finance the cityhood effort,
recently sent out a mailer urging Hollywood residents to "Vote
Democratic for Hollywood City Council!"</TE>
<TE>   One side of the flier listed statewide Democratic candidates,
starting with Gov. Gray Davis and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. On the
other side: five grinning Hollywood candidates, with La Pietra, who
wants to be mayor, at the top of the list.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates on La Pietra's slate: Pashree "Super Pat"
Sripipat, 55, publisher and editor of a bilingual Thai-English
newspaper; Garry Sinanian, a 26-year-old Armenian American flower
shop owner; Rosa Martinez, a preschool teacher at a Hollywood private
school; and Michael Ackerman, 40, an entertainment lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "The slate represents the diversity of Hollywood, and that's very,
very important," said La Pietra, the multimillionaire owner of two
popular gay nightclubs. "I said from the beginning that we would have
a diverse slate of candidates, and we do."</TE>
<TE>   Candidates without access to La Pietra's money for mailings are
creating informal slates. Four have formed the "H Team," with the H
standing for Measure H, the Hollywood ballot initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not a part of La Pietra's campaign,'' said Billy Tsangares,
owner of a Los Feliz T-shirt and gift shop. He gained local fame when
he started the "Free Winona" campaign after actress Winona Ryder was
arrested for allegedly shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   Tsangares, 42, said many Hollywood residents support secession but
feel uncomfortable voting for it because they do not want La Pietra
to run a new city.</TE>
<TE>   "La Pietra has the money, and ... all the [media] attention goes
to him," said Tsangares, who also sells "Free Martha" shirts
featuring domestic diva Martha Stewart behind bars and prefers
distributing news releases printed on cloth.</TE>
<TE>   Issues central to the H Team are opening Lake Hollywood to the
public and supporting Hollywood's artistic community. Other
candidates on the slate include Charles Lohr, 49, a sales and
marketing manager for an international human resources consulting
firm; Paul Merritt, 51, a property and financial services broker; and
William C. Moriarity, a freelance writer.</TE>
<TE>   Some contenders joined together simply to keep each other company
while they knocked on doors. Others hand out their rivals' literature
along with their own.</TE>
<TE>   Tad Davis, 31, a fledgling film director who lives in the
Hollywood Hills, gives voters a flier featuring three other Hollywood
Hills candidates: Jim Meinel, 60, owner of a commercial printing
company; architect Paul Ramsey, 51; and Ed Dilkes, 60, who is
employed as the city manager of Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   "These are three other candidates I trust," Davis told
constituents. "They're very knowledgeable."</TE>
<TE>   One of the crucial issues facing Hollywood is runaway film
production, Davis said. As a council member, he would provide tax
incentives to entertainment companies that shoot in the new city. He
also wants the area to launch a proactive film commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything [the industry] needs is here in Hollywood," including
pre- and post-production businesses, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, Meinel, Ramsey and Dilkes have distributed glossy,
professional-looking brochures. Others, such as actor Neal Jano, 74,
and Richard Eastman, 49, a motion picture costumer on disability,
have turned to word-of-mouth campaigning. Eastman said he has HIV and
is an activist for AIDS-related issues.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Joe Shea said he partly relies on Hollywood voters
recognizing his name. The 55-year-old is a longtime community
activist who has spearheaded efforts to sweep streets, remove
graffiti, support programs for underprivileged young people and drive
illegal sex clubs out of the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be obvious to everyone that a smaller city would help
improve the community," Shea said. "I will lead with integrity,
compassion and courage."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Zarrinnam, 39, the manager of the Hollywood Ramada Inn on
Sunset Boulevard, which is owned by his family, is using recorded
telephone messages to reach voters, reminding them that his name is
"easy to remember because it starts with the last letter of the
alphabet -- Z like zebra."</TE>
<TE>   "But unlike a zebra, there's nothing black and white about the
issue of Hollywood being set free from Los Angeles," Zarrinnam's
pitch continues.</TE>
<TE>   Angelyne, the one-name character whose heavily lined eyes and
platinum hair are splashed on local billboards, has done the most
unusual campaigning -- auctioning off her bras and underpants to
raise money for her council race.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Stephens, a 43-year-old developer, is mailing letters to
residents about a Hollywood revitalization. However, after much
thought since the measure was put on the ballot, Stephens said he
will vote against Hollywood secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Hollywood would lose its luster and reputation if it is
not a part of the City of Angels," he said.</TE>
<TE>   William McGovern, 32, a director and actor, said he is doing
little campaigning. He is running because he supports secession and
wanted to learn the political process.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Eric DeYoung, a prop maker, could not be reached for
comment.</TE>

<HD>Boy, 16, Held in Slaying of Santa Paula Couple</HD>
<DH>Police say the suspect is a neighbor of the victims, who

<LD>A 16-year-old neighbor of a Santa Paula couple found bludgeoned to
death Oct. 21 coveted their car and killed them for it, police said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The youth was arrested, police said, after investigators
discovered evidence linking him to the homicides in a raid at 7 a.m.
Friday of his house, just a few blocks from the home of John M.
Ramirez, Jr., 59, and Joann Wotkyns, 55. They were found dead in
their bed.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they have established no motive beyond the youth's
apparent desire to have the couple's Special Edition 2001 Chevrolet
Monte Carlo. "That may have been the trophy the suspect was looking
for," Santa Paula Police Chief Bob Gonzales told reporters. "It
doesn't add up, it doesn't make sense."</LD>
<TE>   Gonzales would not describe the evidence against the boy, nor say
if a weapon was found. But he said investigators believe they can
link him to the slayings through DNA tests, although the lab results
won't be known for at least a week.</TE>
<TE>   The boy, a student at a continuation high school, was not
identified pending arraignment Monday in Superior Court. He is being
held in Colston juvenile hall in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Santa Paula teenagers -- friends of the suspect -- were
also taken into custody after searches Friday of their Santa Paula
homes by police and district attorney investigators.</TE>
<TE>   A 17-year-old remained in juvenile hall late Friday on suspicion
of possessing a small amount of marijuana. No evidence related to the
homicides was found in his home, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The third juvenile was released from custody, although items from
his home were seized as evidence, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police they saw the youth driving the Chevy in
Santa Paula and Ventura on Oct. 21, the day after investigators
believe the couple were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The car was recovered later in a nearby Kmart parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said the couple, dressed for bed, were "viciously
attacked" sometime after 10 p.m. on the night of Oct. 20.</TE>

<TE>   The third juvenile was released from custody, although items from

<TE>   Police believe the homicide suspect, who lived with his parents in
the same upscale Las Pasadas subdivision as the victims, saw Wotkyns
driving her Monte Carlo around their neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police they saw the youth driving the Chevy in
Santa Paula and Ventura on Oct. 21, the day after investigators
believe the couple were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The car was also spotted the same day at a mobile home park near
the suspect's house, police said, and was recovered later in a nearby
Kmart parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said the couple, dressed for bed, were "viciously
attacked" sometime after 10 p.m. on the night of Oct. 20. An e-mail
by Ramirez to a friend showed he was still alive at that time.</TE>
<TE>   They were found in the upstairs master bedroom of their home on
Corte La Brisa lying on their bed. Their blood was splattered
throughout the room. Autopsies determined they were bludgeoned in the
head.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez and Wotkyns, both in their second marriages, were looking
forward to retirement, friends and family said. And Gonzales said
they were "beloved and respected" in their neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Their bodies were discovered after the couple failed to show up at
the Camarillo technology company, Imation, where they had worked for
about 30 years. The two met at Imation, which makes data cartridges
for computers. They both had grown children from previous marriages.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the worst homicide I've seen in my career," Gonzales said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Daniel L. Duggan, an early partner in Coldwell Banker who helped the
San Francisco-based real estate firm expand into other states and was
a former president of the Los Angeles Realty Board, has died. He was
89.</LD>
<LD>   Duggan died last Saturday of heart failure at his home in Los
Angeles, said his son Dennis.</LD>
<LD>   Duggan headed the Los Angeles Realty Board in 1957, after it had
become the largest organization of its kind in the world with more
than 1,900 members. Growth was burgeoning in residential and
commercial real estate in Southern California, and Duggan was
frequently asked to advise consumer groups about getting the most out
of their investment property.</LD>
<TE>   As the metropolis stretched toward becoming a megalopolis, he was
called upon to reassure property owners in downtown Los Angeles that
suburbanization would not destroy their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is that we are a growing, dynamic community with
developments both in the downtown section and in the outlying
communities," he said in a speech to building managers in the
mid-1950s. "This is to be expected. Otherwise, the residential
periphery would suffer from the lack of branch banks and branch
stores."</TE>
<TE>   To avoid deterioration of the downtown area, he advised, leaders
must improve parking and transportation -- advice still echoed half a
century later. Duggan also was one of the first to advocate
"location, location, location" in selecting real estate that would be
sure to increase in value. Born in Edmonton, Canada, Duggan, who lost
an eye in a childhood accident, moved to Los Angeles with his family
when he was 9. He worked his way through UCLA and USC law school.</TE>
<TE>   Duggan was recruited when Coldwell Banker expanded to L.A. in the
1940s. By 1952, he was one of two new owner-partners added to its
earlier group of 10.</TE>
<TE>   Duggan helped expand the firm throughout the state, then to
Phoenix, Houston, Chicago, New York City and other locations. He
helped to convert the firm from a partnership to a corporation. The
firm went public in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Duggan retired in 1973 and turned his attention to civic and UCLA
alumni organizations and real estate investment with his family. A
planner of Pauley Pavilion at UCLA, he was a chamber of commerce
board member and also served on boards of the Boy Scouts and Hathaway
Home for Children.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Jean Druffel Duggan; sons
Dennis and Richard; a daughter, Joan; and five grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that memorial contributions be sent to Los
Angeles Childrens Hospital, 4650 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90027;
or to St. John's Health Center, 1328 22nd St., Santa Monica, CA
90404.</TE>

<HD>Power Crisis Haunts Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Josh Higgins is a Republican, yet he voted for Democrat Gray Davis
for governor in 1998. He won't do it again. Not now that his Chino
Hills brick factory is paying $40,000 a month for electricity, up
from $15,000 before the power crisis.</LD>
<LD>   "Our costs are crushing us now," Higgins said. "The governor did a
horrible job. He hamstrung us on the long-term contracts, which we'll
be paying for forever."</LD>
<LD>   It's a widespread impression among voters. No issue hurts Davis'
chances of reelection more than his handling of the blackouts, price
spikes and power market meltdown of 2000 and 2001, the governor's
political advisors say. In focus groups, they say, voters complain
that Davis procrastinated, failed to grasp the situation and panicked
by signing too many expensive power contracts.</LD>
<TE>   His Republican opponent, Bill Simon Jr., has tried to reinforce
that impression with television ads that accuse Davis of costing
California consumers $11 billion by failing to act on the energy and
budget crises.</TE>
<TE>   California's partly deregulated electricity industry shook apart
in a wild ride propelled by free market forces, an upset between
supply and demand, and unpredictable politics. More than a year after
calm returned, investigators are still trying to piece together why
the state could not keep the lights burning and avoid outrageous
prices for a basic commodity.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign is quick to point out that power prices have
dropped to reasonable levels and that the state has suffered no
blackouts since May 2001, despite dark predictions.</TE>
<TE>   "No governor in America has probably ever faced the dire situation
he did when our electrical grid was basically in danger of
collapsing," said Garry South, the governor's chief campaign
strategist. "Hindsight is always 20/20, and we have scads of people
in the press and electorate who now have the advantage of hindsight
to second-guess what the governor did."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows just how many billions of dollars have been siphoned
away from California consumers by the unraveling of the state's
deregulation plan -- or how six days of blackouts and the threat of
many more have affected the state economy.</TE>
<TE>   But the two-thirds of the state not served by publicly owned
utilities paid $7 billion for power in 1999, $27 billion in 2000 and
$26.7 billion in 2001. The state treasurer is now in the process of
selling $11.9 billion in bonds to pay back the state general fund for
electricity purchases in 2001. Utility customers will pay off those
bonds through their bills over the next 20 years. That makes it less
likely that customers of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California
Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric will see their rates -- now among
the highest in the nation -- fall any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has repeatedly and accurately described deregulation as the
brainchild of appointees of his predecessor, Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   But the market created under that plan faltered on Davis' watch.
Those critical of his response are numerous, from state lawmakers to
consumer advocates to academics. Their judgments vary, too, and often
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Some say Davis should have seized control of private power plants
to keep electricity flowing. Or he should never have allowed the
state to get into the business of buying electricity for financially
crippled utilities. Some critics say the governor waited too long to
condemn manipulation of the market by private energy sellers. Others
say that by doing so, he alienated the power companies capable of
solving the state's supply shortage.</TE>
<TE>   Persistent Complaints</TE>
<TE>   But the most frequent, persistent complaints about Davis' handling
of the electricity crisis boil down to these: He did not raise
electric rates on businesses and homeowners early enough, thereby
increasing the overall bill for the energy crisis. And he locked up
large amounts of power under contract when wholesale prices were
still soaring in the spring of 2001, so that those $43 billion worth
of contracts -- some lasting 10 years or longer -- became an
expensive burden on utility customers.</TE>
<TE>   James L. Sweeney, a Stanford University professor of management
science and engineering, recently published a book called "The
California Electricity Crisis." In it he concludes that decisions by
political leaders, including Davis, transformed a difficult challenge
into a full-blown crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney argues that if Davis had pushed his appointees on the
California Public Utilities Commission to raise electricity rates,
the higher rates would have boosted conservation. That would have
helped keep power supplies from getting so tight and thus dampened
wholesale power prices, Sweeney said.</TE>
<TE>   "By not allowing price increases at the time they were needed, he
greatly increased the wholesale prices and therefore greatly
increased the total expenditure the ratepayers are going to be forced
to bear," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney and others also argue that higher power rates could also
have helped keep PG&amp;E and Edison from becoming financially crippled.</TE>
<TE>   The utilities were inadvertently squeezed by California's
deregulation plan. A rate freeze imposed by the Legislature in 1996
kept the utilities from billing customers for their full costs when
wholesale power prices jumped. The utilities lost billions of
dollars, so much that in January 2001, power sellers refused to deal
with them. With much of the state on the verge of blackouts and Davis
himself making late-night phone calls to power suppliers across the
West, the governor finally signed an executive order that month
putting the state's money and good credit on the line to buy
electricity. That role does not end until Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   For months before that critical turning point, PG&amp;E and Edison had
asked the PUC to let them charge customers more. In January 2001, the
PUC raised rates by a penny per kilowatt-hour, far less than the
utilities had sought. Three months later, in a move that Davis said
he did not endorse or expect, PUC President Loretta Lynch and other
members of the commission approved another rate hike of as much as
46% for some customers.</TE>
<TE>   Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California
Energy Institute in Berkeley, called the March rate hikes "the right
thing to do when they did do it."</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been much more helpful had it happened earlier," he
said. "After the fact, looking back, there's no question we would
have been better off had we raised retail rates in the summer of
2000."</TE>
<TE>   South, the Davis campaign strategist, acknowledges that there was
much debate among the governor's advisors about whether the PUC
should raise rates. Many of the people Davis consulted, including
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Citigroup Inc.
Co-Chairman Robert Rubin, urged him to propose higher rates.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis hesitated, South said, because only in San Diego, where
the rate freeze had been lifted in the summer of 2000, were consumers
suffering from market price spikes.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we had blackouts in January, the average end users didn't
see any negative effects from deregulation," South said. "It's
unrealistic to expect a public official who holds elected office to
sacrifice himself essentially for something he can't explain to the
typical voter."</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney argues that Davis' unwillingness to make an unpopular
decision led to higher power costs that ratepayers won't begin to pay
until after Tuesday's election, as the state borrows money to cover
past energy costs.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked on the surface ... like he was doing something to
protect the ratepayers from expenses," Sweeney said, "but he was
wanting to make sure they wouldn't face the expenses until after the
election."</TE>
<TE>   Davis faces stiff criticism, too, for allowing the state to sign
dozens of long-term power contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Most experts agree that California needed such contracts as a
refuge from the spot market, and that lack of such stabilizing
contracts would have left the utilities exposed to a sharp jump in
power prices.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the Davis administration ultimately signed too
many contracts at prices and terms too expensive and cumbersome for
the state.</TE>
<TE>   At prices ranging from $59 to $174 per megawatt-hour, the
contracts seemed cheap when they were signed, with market prices
averaging more than $300 per megawatt-hour. But for many reasons,
including the state's having locked up so much power, market prices
plunged to about $60 per megawatt-hour by July 2001, making the
contracted power relatively expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Davis initially defended the contracts. But by October 2001,
barraged with criticism, he ordered his advisors to renegotiate the
deals. His administration also petitioned the federal government to
overturn many of the contracts, arguing that they were signed when
energy companies were illegally manipulating the state's power
market. That petition is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Some Pacts Reworked</TE>
<TE>   So far, a dozen of 48 contracts have been reworked, for a total
savings of $3.6 billion. Another eight contracts have already
expired.</TE>
<TE>   "He should never have signed such long-term deals," said Higgins,
the brick factory owner. "I wouldn't have minded if he had signed
five-year deals; I wouldn't mind if we paid for a certain amount of
time."</TE>
<TE>   But "we got hosed," he said. "And the ratepayers pay it."</TE>
<TE>   South said it is not fair to criticize Davis for locking up so
much power without remembering that in the spring of 2001, experts
predicted that California would suffer many days of blackouts in the
hot months to come if it did not arrange ahead of time for power
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The state was paying an average of $64 million a day for power in
May 2001, compared with about $10 million a day now. The contracts,
South said, "broke the back" of that dysfunctional market.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no power, we had no leverage, we had no legal authority to
compel anybody to sign a contract," he said. "Were the long-term
contracts perfect? No. Did they save California from the abyss? I
think you have to argue that they did."</TE>

<HD>LAPD Failed to Heed Calls About Healer</HD>
<DH>Chief orders probe to see why complaints about woman
charged in death weren't checked out.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton said Friday he has
ordered an investigation to determine why detectives failed to check
out complaints about a Van Nuys faith healer charged this week with
the death of a customer who collapsed after receiving two injections.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton said the department had received several complaints from a
woman caller dating back to May 2001 about possible illegal
activities being conducted by Reina Isabel Chavarria, 48. Detectives
tracked down the caller and interviewed her Friday morning.</LD>
<LD>   "We had received some information about these women more than a
year ago," Bratton said. "I am concerned, very concerned ... about
how the tip was handled and processed within the department."</LD>
<TE>   The woman caller also placed at least two calls to the Police
Department's narcotics division downtown, police said. The
information was written up and sent to the Van Nuys-based Valley
narcotics unit, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   But after that, it's unclear what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he is not looking to place blame or conduct "a witch
hunt." Rather, he said, he wants to know whether the department's
actions were a personnel failure or a systematic problem within the
LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "We will do everything in our power to learn what actions the
department did take, what it didn't take and whether those actions
may have, in any way at all, contributed to possible prevention of
the death of this man," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A key element of the investigation, Bratton said, will focus on
whether reassignments of narcotics detectives to homeland security
details following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks led to a
communication breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   The chief's press conference underscored his pledge this week to
create a "transparent" department, allowing for more public scrutiny
in a bid to enhance credibility and improve the quality of policing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not easy to come here this morning and indicate there may
be problems with the department's handling of this matter," he told
reporters Friday. "But what we are going to try and convince the
public of our sincere interest in determining what went wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton dispatched Van Nuys Division Capt. Bob McNamara to offer
condolences to the family of the victim, Roberto Caceres, 54, on
behalf of the chief and the department.</TE>
<TE>   Caceres and his wife traveled from Santa Ana to Chavarria's home
in the 15700 block of Marlin Place after learning of her practice
through a popular Spanish-language radio station. Caceres was seeking
treatment for a rash that had spread all over his body.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the first time Caceres went to Chavarria's house, he
paid $310 and was given ointments and pills. These didn't cure the
rash, and he returned Monday for two injections.</TE>
<TE>   After the shots, Caceres went into convulsions and died minutes
later at Valley Presbyterian Hospital, police said.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy was conducted Friday, but toxicology tests are not
expected to be completed for about six weeks, said Craig Harvey,
spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. Examiners
said, however, that Caceres received two injections, one containing
vitamin B-12 and the other with the steroid B-Methasone, used to
treat allergic disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Chavarria and her assistant, Margarita Montes, 28, who police said
administered the injections, were charged this week with involuntary
manslaughter and the unauthorized practice of medicine causing death.
If convicted, each defendant faces up to nine years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   According to city records, Chavarria has lived at the Marlin Place
address at least since 1997. Neighbors said they observed a constant
flow of mostly working-class Latino families, with people lining up
in front of the house as early as 4:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   One neighbor said he called police when he noticed men and women
leaving their children in their cars while they went into the home.
Another resident said he complained by phone to Los Angeles City
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski's office about an illegal business
being operated and that it was creating a parking and litter problem.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Kievman, an aide to Miscikowski, said she could not recall
such a complaint.</TE>

Another resident said he complained by phone to Los Angeles City
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski's office about an illegal business
being operated and that it was creating a parking and litter problem.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Kievman, an aide to Miscikowski, said she could not recall
such a complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Building and Safety Department received a complaint in
2000 that the Marlin Place home was possibly being used as a "massage
parlor and medical office," said Bob Steinbach, chief inspector for
the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a subsequent investigation, and there was no evidence of
either," he said.</TE>

<HD>Fullerton Defends Clerk Measure Ad</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fullerton officials are defending a city newspaper ad that offers
reasons voters should support a measure on Tuesday's ballot that
would change the city clerk from an elected to appointed position.</LD>
<LD>   State law bars the use of public funds for campaigning. A
publication is considered improper advocacy if, "taken as a whole, it
unambiguously urges a particular result in an election. The ad, in
the Fullerton News Tribune, lists numerous supporters and one
opposing group.</LD>
<LD>   City spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer said the ad was proper.</LD>
<TE>   But county Supervisor-elect Chris Norby said, "This is advocacy
[and] I don't think it's proper."</TE>

<HD>Gospel Group Embraces All Races</HD>
<DH>Hollywood choir founded by a white lawyer melds the voices
of a varied lot of singers. Love of music binds them together.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carla Rivera</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The church in which Patrick Hare grew up did not allow musical
expression of any kind. So the toe-tapping role the religious-minded
public defender has taken on these days would probably surprise some
of his former brethren.</LD>
<LD>   He is founder, frontman and spiritual bellwether for the
interdenominational, intergenerational and interracial Hollywood Mass
Choir, a group that is an almost perfect manifestation of Los
Angeles' kaleidoscopic diversity.</LD>
<LD>   Among the 60-member ensemble is a female Brazilian chaplain who
works at Childrens Hospital, a Chinese political and religious
refugee who wasn't allowed to sing in her home country, an arranger
who has worked with Aretha Franklin and Bill Cosby, a graphic artist,
a therapist, homeless people and others -- many of them with little
or no formal musical training.</LD>
<TE>   They are something rare for Los Angeles: a disparate collection of
backgrounds, incomes and ZIP Codes that has come together as a
family. And only a year after forming, they are among the five
finalists Saturday night in Gospelfest at the Shrine Auditorium,
Southern California's premier event to choose the best amateur vocal
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their lack of background, the Hollywood choir members are
no poseurs. They are not gospel with a gloss of the bland and
commercial; that is the kind of contemporary Christian music that
Hare found so unfulfilling after abandoning the fundamentalist church
of his youth.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for something with good quality lyrics, something
that was a fusion of blues, rock and spiritual, and I found that in
gospel music that is in the tradition of the black church," said
Hare, who is white.</TE>
<TE>   Hare's faith also guided him to become a public defender (he has
worked in the Los Angeles County office 13 years), representing
accused who have few means. "People I wouldn't have encountered in my
pretty sheltered suburban existence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hare and many of the choir members attend Hollywood Presbyterian
Church, where the group was recently rehearsing for the Shrine event,
which is in its 18th year and benefits a high school scholarship
fund.</TE>
<TE>   In the darkened and cool sanctuary of the church, Hare was
animated as he led his group through the paces of the old up-tempo
spiritual "Rock-A My Soul," one of two songs it will perform
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Hare grew up in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, and was a voice and
performance major in college before heading to Boston University,
where he obtained a law degree. After moving to Los Angeles, he began
singing in the choruses of Long Beach Opera and Opera Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   After discovering gospel, he became one of the few non-African
American members of a local chapter of the Gospel Music Workshop, a
venerable group founded by the Rev. James Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   When Hare decided to form his own choir he was encouraged by the
workshop. He put out fliers soliciting members on church bulletin
boards, at record stores that sell gospel music, over Internet lists
and even at the popular Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles soul food
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Hare said the auditions consisted of "showing up" and that members
mainly had to have a desire to spread the joyful noise of traditional
black gospel.</TE>
<TE>   That idiom's sense of sorrowful burden leavened with righteous
uplift, Hare thought, could help build a ministry of music that would
feel as at home in La Canada-Flintridge as in South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   The choir has performed in both those places and takes its message
of redemption to hospitals, jails, shelters for the homeless, nursing
homes and other community events.</TE>
<TE>   Such outings, "in places where it's not easy to get Jesus in their
lives or hear gospel," are what particularly appeal to Corey Robinson
denBok, a high school sophomore, who joined the choir a few months
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Choir member Debbie Ding came to this country only four years ago
from China after applying for political asylum. Her family was
persecuted because they were not communists and practiced
Christianity, said Ding, and she was not able to receive the music
training she desired. On Saturday she'll realize a dream.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me 30 years to get on stage," she said cheerily as the
choir took a break. "At the rehearsals I have tears in my eyes
because I'm so appreciative. I never tell [Patrick]. Maybe he
notices, but I never tell him."</TE>
<TE>   Maricarmen Castro, a chaplain at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles,
knew Hare for years but hesitated to join the choir.</TE>
<TE>   Originally from Brazil, she was unsure if she could sing
English-language spirituals with no written words in front of her
until she thought more about the music's origins among field slaves
who passed on the traditions without notes on paper.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fascinated by the whole setting," Castro said of her first
meetings. "I had no background in singing but I wasn't intimidated,
because there were so many others like me. It's a great example of
how to break down barriers of culture and race."</TE>
<TE>   There are Marvin Wadlow, who produced a hip hop show for HBO;
Traci Maffei, a marriage and family counselor; Nancy Brown, who runs
a retirement home; and Caesar Peters, who works for the Lord's
Lighthouse ministry for the homeless and has been homeless himself.</TE>
<TE>   One reason this group of such varied talents has succeeded is the
influence of the Rev. Alexander Hamilton, an accompanist, arranger
and conductor who has worked with the likes of Aretha Franklin, Bill
Cosby and Gladys Knight and the Pips.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton, who has become a mentor to Hare's choir, also is
associated with three of his own choirs, one of which, Compton-based
Voices of Inspiration, won the first Gospelfest 18 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Other adult choir finalists in Gospelfest, which is sponsored by
McDonald's, are the Mary Lind Foundation Choir and the Voices of
Zion, both of Los Angeles; Jubilant Voices of Holman, from Duarte;
and the Robert Taylor II Community Mass Choir, from Cerritos.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood choir members, Hamilton said, "have a lot of
enthusiasm about what they're doing, and that kind of realness is
hard to resist.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working on things that make a choir good, and it's not
just singing; it's the coming together," he added. "It's easy to put
a choir together for one or two occasions, but to keep them together
requires that they become a family."</TE>

<HD>Hopefuls Pledge to Keep Port Hueneme's Momentum Rolling</HD>
<DH>The five contenders for City Council say they want to build
on the many successes the beach town has enjoyed in recent years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The economy is in good shape in the beach town of Port Hueneme, and
the five candidates in Tuesday's City Council election say they have
thrown themselves into the race to ensure things stay that way.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Jon Sharkey and Mayor Anthony Volante and challengers
Steven Kinney, Helen McPherson and Maricela Morales are vying for
three seats on the council.</LD>
<LD>   All five candidates said they are satisfied with the current
council's work and would like to build on its success.</LD>
<TE>   The 67-year-old Volante, who has served two terms on the council
and two years as mayor, said he is "staying positive" that voters
will remember the current council's work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been quite a run, one that's been very successful in
accomplishing the business of the people," said Volante, a retired
Air Force colonel.</TE>
<TE>   Volante and Sharkey said they are proud of the housing
developments the city has built in the last several years, a new
water treatment plant and the city's home buyer assistance program.
But they said Port Hueneme needs experienced leaders to deal with
financial issues, the construction of a new sewer system and beach
erosion problems.</TE>
<TE>   A Bustling Market Street</TE>
<TE>   Sharkey, 53, a semi-retired piano repairman who came on the
council at the same time as Volante, said he would like to make
Market Street, in the city's old downtown, a town center bustling
with homes, shops and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've got great potential, and it'd be nice to be around
to see it through," Sharkey said. "The larger things that are hard to
do take time, but this has been my area of interest and I don't know
who else would pick up the ball."</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, Port Hueneme has undergone a slow
transformation from a World War II Navy town to an appealing, albeit
sleepy, city by the sea. This was no easy task in a city with few
ways of expanding its business base. But with the use of
redevelopment funds, the council was able to give Port Hueneme a new
look and feel.</TE>
<TE>   Abandoned lots became city parks, modern condos sprang up along
beachfront streets and a business district was developed along
Channel Islands Boulevard. Trees were planted and medians landscaped.
City sewer and water systems were improved. A library and community
center were built.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on Finances</TE>
<TE>   Challengers Kinney and McPherson are stressing the importance of
good financial management.</TE>
<TE>   Kinney, 54, who has served as president of the Economic
Development Corp. of Oxnard for eight years, said his career has
prepared him for the challenges of leading a city like Port Hueneme.
The development group helps businesses expand and attract new jobs
and investments to the Oxnard and Port Hueneme area.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the fact that we can't expand physically, we need to focus
on business development within our borders," Kinney said. "It's what
I do for a living."</TE>
<TE>   Kinney would like to see the revitalization of the old downtown
area, between Ventura Road and the entrance to the port. He would
also push to increase tourism and promote the beach area.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson, 59, a retired procurement negotiator and administrator
with the federal government, said the city needs someone with a
business background to keep its finances in order. She would like
City Hall to communicate better with residents through its Web site,
newsletters and bulletins.</TE>
<TE>   Senior citizen services are also a concern for McPherson, who has
served on the homeowners association of the Hueneme Bay retirement
community.</TE>
<TE>   Living-Wage Advocate</TE>
<TE>   While most of the incumbents and challengers are focused on
economics and city services, Morales said quality-of-life issues,
such as bringing a living-wage ordinance to the city, are her
priorities. The 32-year-old Morales is associate executive director
for the nonprofit Central Coast Alliance for a Sustainable Economy, a
community planning and policy research center.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, let's make sure that our finances are in order, but I see
those as nuts-and-bolts issues that all city councils must deal
with," Morales said. "But there are other issues, such as community
programs for youth and affordable homes, that I consider the heart of
the community."</TE>
<TE>   Morales said she also wants to start a "Shop Hueneme" campaign to
encourage residents to spend their money in town.</TE>

<HD>JDL Leader's Attorneys Seek FBI Inquiry Files</HD>
<DH>They say government has it in for bomb-plot suspect, citing
earlier allegations that league had scammed rappers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to prove that Jewish Defense League leader Irv Rubin is the
target of a government vendetta, his lawyers have asked federal
prosecutors to turn over records of a three-year FBI probe into
allegations that the JDL participated in a scheme to extort money
from the late rap stars Tupac Shakur and Eazy-E through death
threats.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI inquiry began in 1996 and was closed in 1999 with a
finding that the allegations could not be substantiated.</LD>
<LD>   In papers filed in U.S. District Court this week, Rubin's lawyers
called the probe another example of the government's longtime bias
against their client.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, the defense advanced similar charges, citing the FBI's
investigation of Rubin in connection with the unsolved 1985 bombing
death in Santa Ana of Alex Odeh, West Coast director of the American
Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's lawyers hope to raise the issue of alleged government bias
when Rubin and his chief lieutenant, Earl Krugel, go to trial in
January on charges of conspiring to bomb King Fahd Mosque in Culver
City and a field office of Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), who is of
Lebanese descent. In the latest defense document, attorney Peter
Morris accuses the government of falsely charging Rubin in the
bombing case "to finally convict him after its earlier unsuccessful
attempts to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Morris said the defense first learned of the rapper extortion
investigation last week after locating copies of previously released
FBI documents on the Internet. He said the defense immediately sent
the prosecution a letter requesting the entire FBI case file. The
defense is also seeking access to the Odeh investigation files.</TE>
<TE>   According to Morris' account, the FBI targeted Rubin and the JDL
in its investigations of the "murders" of Shakur and Eazy-E, whose
given name was Eric Wright. In fact, Wright was not slain. He died of
AIDS-related complications in 1995. Shakur was fatally wounded in
1996 after a scuffle at a Las Vegas hotel. But the records obtained
by Morris to date give no indication that Rubin was considered a
suspect in Shakur's murder.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, in a telephone interview Friday, acknowledged the errors,
saying, "We're looking for any investigation that the government has
done or might be doing into the JDL or Irv Rubin."</TE>
<TE>   Additional documents, obtained by The Times under the Freedom of
Information Act, show that the extortion allegations first surfaced
in September 1996, while an FBI agent was interviewing a confidential
informant about the Odeh murder.</TE>
<TE>   "The scheme involves [name blacked out] and other subjects making
telephonic death threats to the rap star," according to the agent's
written account of the interview. "Subjects then intercede by
contacting the victim and offering protection for a fee.</TE>
<TE>   "The victim and their family are taken to a 'safe haven,' usually
a private estate, and are protected by gun-toting bodyguards
associated with the Jewish Defense League. The subjects convince the
victim they have worked a 'deal' out with the person(s) making the
death threats, and the threats cease. The victim then pays the
subjects for the protection services rendered and resume [sic] their
normal lifestyle with no fear of further death threats."</TE>
<TE>   The agent said another reliable informant subsequently
corroborated the allegations and named the same people.</TE>
<TE>   "Writer is familiar with captioned subjects, as their names have
surfaced in the Odeh investigation and also a case captioned 'Jewish
Defense League,' " added the agent.</TE>
<TE>   FBI headquarters in Washington gave the Los Angeles-based agent
three months to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the allegations,
and granted three extensions "to determine whether the extortionate
activities of subject are in furtherance of the social and/or
political goals of the Jewish Defense League," according to documents
obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1997, the Los Angeles field office received permission to
launch a full-scale criminal investigation after telling Washington
it had developed information that the main target was acting on
behalf of the JDL, according to the documents.</TE>
<TE>   Another memo, heavily edited, indicated that in 1992 Wright was
paying someone $1,000 a week as a security consultant because of
threats on his life. The recipient's name was blacked out in the
memo.</TE>
<TE>   Morris said Friday that he didn't know if Rubin had performed
security work for Shakur or Wright. Krugel's lawyer, Mark Werksman,
said his client, a dental hygienist, had nothing to do with anyone in
the rap world.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1999, the Los Angeles FBI office shut down the
investigation, telling headquarters that the allegations were
extensively investigated but could not be substantiated.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the defense will be able to claim government bias during
the upcoming trial could be decided Monday when U.S. District Judge
Ronald S.W. Lew conducts a hearing on a number of pretrial motions.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Attys. Gregory Jessner and Daniel Rubinstein, who
are prosecuting the case, have contended in their legal briefs that
such a claim would confuse and mislead the jury.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution is on record as opposing a motion by Morris and
co-counsel Bryan Altman to sever Rubin's case from Krugel's. Rubin's
lawyers say racist comments made by Krugel during secretly recorded
conversations with a government informant would prejudice the jury.</TE>
<TE>   They also said Krugel plans to mount a defense based on a claim of
illegal entrapment, meaning that he took part in the bombing plot but
was induced by the FBI informant, a former JDL member. Rubin contends
that he had nothing to do with any bombing plot.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, 56, and Krugel, 59, were arrested last December and have
been held without bail.</TE>

<HD>Man, 73, Is Arrested in Bank Heist in Irvine</HD>
<DH>The suspect's missteps, including using his own car, led to
his capture after $1,000 robbery.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 73-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of robbery in Irvine on
Friday after a series of slip-ups, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Martin Randall parked his car directly in front
of Cathay Bank in the 15000 block of Culver Drive just before noon,
approached a teller and gave her a note. She handed over more than
$1,000, which Randall put in a handbag, police said.</LD>
<LD>   As the construction consultant returned to his car and pulled into
traffic, a witness reportedly wrote down his license number.</LD>
<TE>   Randall drove to his own bank, Union Bank in the 2000 block of
Michelson Drive, deposited $500 in his account and got a cashier's
check for another $500, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police were waiting at his home near Quail Creek and Jeffrey Road
when he arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Police Sgt. Mike Hamel said Randall might be responsible
for two similar bank robberies in Newport Beach. In his car, they
found a money wrapper with the initials FENB. Police said the wrapper
probably belonged to the Far East National Bank in Newport Beach,
which was robbed last month. Police said he also had been convicted
of bank robbery in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't exactly fit the profile of your usual bank robber,"
Hamel said. "In fact, he doesn't fit any of the profiles. We rarely
see anybody this old, and we rarely see someone who parks in front of
the bank. In fact, we rarely see anybody who uses their own car.
That's unusual."</TE>

<HD>Indicted Mayor Stirs Passions</HD>
<DH>Wayne Baglin, long a Laguna Beach fixture, is the talk of
the town after felony charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley and Stanley Allison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along the narrow streets lined with restaurants and galleries in
downtown Laguna Beach, everyone seems to know Wayne Baglin.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe they voted for him -- he's been a member of the City Council
for eight years and a political figure in town for two decades. Or
maybe he helped them buy their homes -- he's one of the town's top
Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Baglin stands accused of mixing public life and private
business in what Orange County prosecutors call a felony conflict of
interest.</LD>
<TE>   Baglin, the city's mayor, was indicted Thursday for representing
the sellers of two downtown properties the city purchased last year.
Though Baglin didn't vote on the deal, he made a $36,000 commission.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach prides itself on its small-town atmosphere. So as
word of the indictment spread through the city of 26,000 on Friday,
feelings were passionate and personal.</TE>
<TE>   To his supporters, Baglin is a committed environmentalist and
public servant being punished simply for trying to make a living. To
critics, Baglin crossed the line by profiting from business before
the city.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment makes Patricia Truman angry because "I don't see
that he did anything except conduct business in a businesslike
manner."</TE>
<TE>   "He ran [for office] as a Realtor," she said. "There's no secret.
Everything he did was out in the open."</TE>
<TE>   But Benjamin Jones, who had stopped in a coffee shop to get his
wife a gift certificate, took the opposite view.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a Realtor, there's a code of ethics, and he should have
stayed out of that transaction altogether," he said. It didn't matter
that Baglin recused himself from the vote, he added. "He profited."</TE>
<TE>   The case dates to January 2001, when the City Council, in search
of land for a senior center, voted to buy a pair of adjacent parcels
on 3rd Street.</TE>
<TE>   The owners, Edgar and Dorothy Hatfield, were clients and friends
of Baglin's.</TE>
<TE>   Though Baglin recused himself from the council's vote on the land
and disclosed his relationship with the sellers, he represented the
couple during negotiations with the city.</TE>
<TE>   Some say Baglin should not have relinquished his role as a
councilman in favor of clients.</TE>
<TE>   Baglin's attorney, Michael Molfetta, noted that the commission
came from the Hatfields, not the city.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Ernie Quigley took the defendant's side: "Somebody's out
to crucify Wayne Baglin. It's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, residents said the city will cope.</TE>
<TE>   "Our city can stand anything: fires, floods, mudslides," said
resident John Gabriels. "This is no big deal."</TE>

<LD>Along the narrow streets lined with restaurants and galleries in

<TE>   Though Baglin recused himself from the council's vote on the land
and disclosed his relationship with the sellers, he represented the

<TE>   Some say Baglin should not have relinquished his role as a
councilman in favor of clients.</TE>
<TE>   A videotape of a public meeting in December 2000 shows City Atty.
Philip Kohn asking the council for a recess to consult with Baglin
once the discussions gave rise to a possible conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "I did take the initiative to raise the matter with him at a
public meeting when the issue of Baglin's connection with the
property came up," Kohn said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But what was said between them during that consultation, and any
other conversations, remain secret, protected even from prosecutors
by the attorney-client privilege.</TE>
<TE>   Baglin's attorney, Michael Molfetta, said Friday that his client
does not think he is taking any risks because he is confident he did
nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "He's either stupid, which he is not, or he's innocent," Molfetta
said.</TE>
<TE>   Molfetta said he also sought to clarify a few facts in the case.
For one thing, he said, Baglin earned a $36,000 commission, not the
widely reported $54,000. And all that money was paid by the
Hatfields. Baglin could have collected an equal commission from the
city, but didn't, Molfetta said.</TE>
<TE>   Molfetta said he and Baglin "tried to work with the district
attorney's office to put this to rest, so the taxpayers wouldn't be
burdened."</TE>
<TE>   He said the two sides had different philosophies on how to resolve
the conflict of interest. He would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The charge is a felony, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or
imprisonment. Those found guilty can also be barred from holding
office in California.</TE>
<TE>   Molfetta said the case is being driven by small-town politics, and
that Baglin would be cleared.</TE>
<TE>   "It's petty. It's boring," he said. "And at the end of the day,
we'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Resident Ernie Quigley took the defendant's side: "Somebody's out
to crucify Wayne Baglin. It's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, residents said the city will cope.</TE>
<TE>   "Our city can stand anything: fires, floods, mudslides," said
resident John Gabriels. "This is no big deal."</TE>

<HD>Eli, My Friend, for $5 Million I Am All Yours</HD>

<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So wait a minute. The L.A. school board only meets twice a month?</LD>
<LD>   And billionaire Eli Broad was allegedly going to pony up $10
million to Occidental College if school President Theodore R.
Mitchell would run for trustee?</LD>
<LD>   Look, I love my job. But if Broad is throwing that kind of change
around, I'll be his boy in a heartbeat. And I'll cut him a deal, too.</LD>
<TE>   I'm available for $5 million, Eli.</TE>
<TE>   Make me your stooge.</TE>
<TE>   Broad claims this was no quid pro quo. He says he'd been talking
to Mitchell for years about creating an institute at Occidental to
train principals and charter school bosses, and that Mitchell didn't
have to run for school board to get the $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't square with what sources told The Times. They
said Mitchell wasn't interested in running for school board, but he
was persuaded by Broad's offer to fork over the $10 million to
Occidental.</TE>
<TE>   As this scenario goes, it's a continuation of longtime efforts by
Broad and his pal, former L.A. Mayor Dick Riordan, to own the school
board lock, stock and barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, who might be able to help us figure out what went down,
has dodged a crystal clear explanation. Better to remain silent and
be thought a sellout than open your mouth and remove all doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Targeted trustee David Tokofsky is seen by some as a bit of a
maverick who didn't knuckle under to the money boys. As the theory
goes, Broad and Riordan wanted him out, with Ted Mitchell as the
latest addition to their wooden dummy collection on the school board.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky comes out looking pretty good in this mess. There he is
doing his job, not particularly attached to one constituency or
another, which is pretty hard to pull off in a political minefield
like a school district.</TE>
<TE>   He's not in bed with the union, the administration or other
trustees, and although some people can't quite figure out exactly
where he's coming from, he's beholden to no one but himself.</TE>
<TE>   And for this, he practically has a contract put out on him.</TE>
<TE>   "An independent thinker in an educational institution -- is that
oxymoronic or something?" Tokofsky asked.</TE>
<TE>   I'm going to stop quoting him now because I don't want him to
sound too good. In fact, one reason I called him Friday night was to
let him know I might be making a run at him.</TE>
<TE>   I live in his district, for one thing. It includes Silver Lake.
And believe me, I know what has to be done in the classroom. I
attended one of the worst high schools in California.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky laughed at the news. But I wasn't kidding.</TE>
<TE>   Not only do I live in the district, but guess what? Some critics
say it was old school arrogance to try to plant another white trustee
in a mostly Latino district.</TE>
<TE>   Attention voters: Me llamo Esteban.</TE>
<TE>   Now here's the money shot:</TE>
<TE>   I know Eli Broad. I've considered him a close amigo ever since the
time I clubbed him in the column and he invited me to lunch at Los
Tacos in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Wait a minute. I ought to be charging $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   As a matter of fact, I had smacked Broad around for this same kind
of string-pulling. He had slipped a cool $100,000 in pocket change to
Antonio Villaraigosa, through a back door, in the last mayoral
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, I had a problem with the likes of Broad -- rich guys
who think they can buy anything they want. Good intentions and civic
duty are one thing, I thought, but with some of these high-rollers,
we're much better off when they devote their golden years to golf.</TE>
<TE>   How naive of me.</TE>
<TE>   Over enchiladas that day, Broad told me how the real world works
-- while his limo idled outside. He spoke of his commitment to Los
Angeles, to public schools in particular, and to his notion that
school boards are overrun with hacks and political opportunists.</TE>
<TE>   Better they be overrun with yes men who answer to no one but
billionaires who think they know best.</TE>
<TE>   And here I am, but there's just one hitch.</TE>
<TE>   I won't work with Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Tell me what you want and you've got my vote, Eli. More teachers,
more books, hit jobs on the other trustees. I can cozy up to Supt.
Roy Romer or I can blindside him, whichever strings you care to pull.</TE>
<TE>   But any candidate for governor who gets outshined by Bill Simon
ought not have anything to do with the education of our children.</TE>
<TE>   Give me a call, Eli, and I'll quit this horse today. OK, I can be
had for $3 million, and believe me, I can take this bum Tokofsky.
What's he stand for, anyway?</TE>

<LD>Lucille Ryman Carroll, who headed MGM's talent department from 1941
to 1954 and helped sign a young actress named Lana Turner, died Oct.
23 in Glendale. She was 96 and had been ailing for some time.</LD>
<LD>   Carroll, who also helped arrange a key screen test for Marilyn
Monroe and played a role in bringing June Allyson and Janet Leigh to
MGM, was one of the few women to reach a position of executive power
in the old Hollywood studio system.</LD>
<LD>   "She was strong-willed and indomitable, but always a lady," said
Harrison Price, her longtime friend and financial manager. "That's
how she made it to Louis B. Mayer's studio."</LD>
<TE>   Carroll worked directly with Mayer, auditioning actors, shopping
for scripts and supervising the studio's younger talents.</TE>
<TE>   Once, on her way across country to interview teenage actresses for
the 1944 movie "National Velvet," she got an urgent call from
Elizabeth Taylor. She was not yet 12 years old at the time -- too
young for the role of Velvet Brown, Carroll had decided.</TE>
<TE>   "Elizabeth Taylor burst into my office and said, 'I hear you're
going looking for someone to play Velvet. I don't know why you're
wasting your time. I'm going to play Velvet.' "</TE>
<TE>   Carroll made her national search as planned but Taylor got the
part anyway. "If Elizabeth Taylor wanted something, she would get
it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll was known to be a tough business woman with a soft heart
who mentored Hollywood hopefuls with the help of her actor husband,
John Carroll, who reached his peak in the '40s as a leading man in
such frolics as the Marx Brothers' "Go West." John Carroll died in
1979; the couple had no children.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucille was chronically generous," Price said. "She couldn't turn
down anybody with a hard-luck story."</TE>
<TE>   One of her most famous proteges was Monroe, a newcomer when she
met the Carrolls in 1947 at a celebrity golf tournament. For months
after that, the 21-year-old Monroe lived rent-free in the Carrolls'
Hollywood apartment while they spent weekends on their horse ranch in
Granada Hills. They gave her a weekly allowance of $100 -- but
Lucille Carroll did not get her an MGM studio contract.</TE>
<TE>   "She was cute and sexy but she didn't have the leading lady
quality that Mr. Mayer was signing up in 1947," she explained to
Monroe biographer Donald Spoto.</TE>
<TE>   The Carrolls did pressure John Huston to give Monroe a screen test
when the director was casting his 1950 movie "The Asphalt Jungle."</TE>
<TE>   Huston owed the Carrolls $18,000 in boarding fees for his horses,
and they offered to extend his payments if he would give Monroe a
chance. Huston hired Monroe to play Angela in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Macon County, Ill., the oldest of three children, Lucille
Ryman dreamed of being an actress. Her father, a doctor, was killed
in World War I and her mother, a schoolteacher, raised the family.
The aspiring actress moved to Los Angeles to attend UCLA in the late
'20s and studied acting at the Pasadena Community Theater in the
early 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   She got stage roles at the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood and the
Morosco Theater in New York in the early 1930s but turned to
smaller-scale producing and directing.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, she was named a traveling talent scout for Universal
Studios, based in New York. Four years later she moved to MGM in
Hollywood, where she met her husband.</TE>
<TE>   While she was at MGM, she was the personal manager of several
actors, including her husband. From the time after she left her
studio job in 1954 until well into the 1970s, she produced the
occasional film, including "Ride in a Pink Car" (1978) in which her
husband played a leading role. She also purchased the screen rights
to classic movie scripts, among them "The Bridge of San Luis Rey."</TE>
<TE>   The Carrolls lived graciously, Price recalled. "Lucille was a lady
of the old school," he said. "She loved fine silverware and French
antiques. She was proud of an antique bed she owned. King Louis of
France slept in it -- well, one of the King Louis."</TE>
<TE>   By the late '30s, Carroll had persuaded the rest of her family to
join her in Los Angeles. "She managed her family like she managed her
career," Price said.</TE>
<TE>   Her brother, Herbert, became one of the most important artists at
Walt Disney Studios, drawing the first illustrations of Disneyland,
which opened in 1955, as well as Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   After his death in 1989, Carroll established the Ryman-Carroll
Foundation, of which Price is a founding board member, in Herbert
Ryman's memory. The art program offers weekend classes to high school
students from Southern California schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucille considered her brother to be a great California artist,"
said Marty Sklar, vice chairman of Walt Disney Imagineering, who was
a close friend of Herbert Ryman and is president of the Ryman-Carroll
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   But even with her brother, she was the talent manager. Sklar said,
"Lucille would look at [his] paintings and say, 'Herbie, paint some
more animals right in here.' "</TE>
<TE>   In her will, Carroll requested that donations in her memory be
made to the foundation's Ryman Program for Young Artists, 315 W. 9th
St., Suite 806, Los Angeles, CA 90015-4202.</TE>

<HD>Recall Effort Highlights a Political Fault Line</HD>
<DH>Some voters in her Santa Barbara County district consider
Supervisor Gail Marshall too liberal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Her patriotism has been questioned and she's been portrayed as a
hothead. So County Supervisor Gail Marshall -- facing the voters
Tuesday -- keeps her guard up now, a politician burned.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, the man who could replace her, Jim Thomas, seems
relaxed. A shrewd politician with the style of a good old boy, he was
the county sheriff for 12 years until he resigned to oppose Marshall.
If he doesn't unseat her next week, he says, he'll head home to Los
Olivos and Oscar, his quarter horse.</LD>
<LD>   Marshall is the target of a bitter recall fight that is expected
to top the $1-million mark in campaign spending. Most of the spending
is by Thomas, who will serve in her place if voters recall her and if
he wins a separate vote for the position.</LD>
<TE>   Marshall represents the 3rd District, a swing area that crosses
the ideological line between Santa Barbara's north and south. The
district is a blend of pro-growth ranchers in the north and
slow-growth college students at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Though Marshall lives in Solvang, the recall drive has been
strongest in her own backyard, where critics accuse her of
consistently selling out north county interests on subjects ranging
from agricultural regulation and development to the makeup of the 3rd
District itself.</TE>
<TE>   The imaginary dividing line between north and south in Santa
Barbara County is the Gaviota Pass. To the south is the old-money,
world-famous city of Santa Barbara, increasingly liberal in its
politics and committed to slow growth.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall's critics say she has been the swing vote on county
issues about 100 times, almost always siding with the south's two
county supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Those votes have included opposition to a proposal for more
offshore oil drilling, support for a ban on so-called Saturday night
"junk guns," and condemnation of the Boy Scouts for discriminating
against homosexuals.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason for the voting pattern is simple: Though
Marshall, a Democrat, lives in the north, her political stronghold is
actually on the other side of that imaginary line, in Goleta and in
the liberal voting bloc at the university. She carried Isla Vista
with 85% of the vote in the last election.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall points out that most of her constituents actually live in
the south -- about two-thirds, she says. Thus, she says, she is
simply representing the majority of the people who put her in office
in 1996 and reelected her in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But the political landscape in Santa Barbara has been changing;
the north grew almost twice as fast as the south in the last decade.
Its population now is 198,345, slightly fewer than the 201,000
residents to the south.</TE>
<TE>   So last year, when it was time to redistrict the county, Marshall
solidified her political base by rejecting efforts to stick Isla
Vista in another district and add the prison population of Lompoc to
hers.</TE>
<TE>   "Prisoners obviously can't vote," said Lammy Johnstone-Kockler,
leader of the recall drive. "The political machine in Santa Barbara
has become ultra liberal. They aren't even middle of the road, and
Gail has chosen to become part of that."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall said her critics have distorted her record. She is
pro-agriculture, she said, but not a supporter of absolute property
rights. Beyond that, she added, the recall drive is "sleazy," a
blatant try for a midterm power grab and a shameless abuse of the
recall process.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the No on Recall Committee, Santa Barbara political
activist Das Williams said the county needs Marshall to help fight
conservative agricultural, oil and development interests that would
be much more comfortable dealing with Thomas, a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   "Our county and the area need a slow-growth supervisor," Williams
said.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, 57, said he thinks the recall is needed primarily because
there has been too much divisiveness in county government. Already, a
signature drive is underway in the northern areas to break away and
create a new government called Mission County. That drive will
probably end if the recall succeeds, Marshall's critics say.</TE>
<TE>   "In dealing with ranchers and farmers, she is much more regulatory
than I would be," Thomas said. "But that isn't the only issue here.
We all know the state budget is not in good shape. There are going to
be hard decisions in county government.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, she has tended toward across-the-board cuts in all
departments," Thomas said. "My view is very different. I believe
government is formed to protect people. My priorities are police,
fire, medical and infrastructure, roads and such."</TE>
<TE>   There are 45,952 registered voters in the 3rd District. Bob Smith,
the county's chief election official, predicts a countywide turnout
of 60%. The intensity of the recall drive could bring out even more
voters in the 3rd, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The political rancor reached its peak when a controversy erupted
over saying the Pledge of Allegiance at one of Marshall's advisory
committees five weeks after Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Like thousands of local officials all over the United States,
Marshall, 62, said she and Santa Barbara County's four other elected
supervisors spent the immediate weeks after the terrorist attacks
busily drafting emergency plans for whatever might come next.</TE>
<TE>   It was the time of anthrax scares, and citizens everywhere were
wary of unusual mail.</TE>
<TE>   "I had one myself," Marshall said. "They served me the official
recall complaints at 5:30 in the morning at my home. Somebody I never
saw before tries to hand me this large envelope. I told him to drop
it on the ground and called the sheriff's office."</TE>
<TE>   But that was nothing compared with the night of Oct. 18, 2001,
when Marshall believes she was set up for embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   There was a meeting of the Santa Ynez Valley General Plan Advisory
Committee, ostensibly to talk about local riding trails.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's chairman, Joe Olla, who was appointed by Marshall,
called her to see if it would be acceptable to start the meeting with
the Pledge of Allegiance, which had never been part of committee
meetings. Olla said Marshall had told him that she feared it would be
divisive because "we all have our own way of showing patriotism." She
said she had told him to get the approval of the entire committee.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Olla called then-Sheriff Thomas, who arrived with a flag.
Newspaper and TV reporters also showed up. Both sides say the other
tipped them.</TE>
<TE>   Olla said the pledge. Then a woman in the crowd denounced
Marshall, accusing her of trying to block the pledge. Then, visibly
angry, Marshall charged down the aisle and brought matters to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   "She was angry," Williams conceded. "She blew her cool."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas says Marshall fired Olla after the meeting. Her version: "I
didn't fire him. I said, 'Joe, it's time for you to resign.' "</TE>
<TE>   "I have never said her reaction was unpatriotic myself," Thomas
said. "But it was poor judgment, and it raised the question of anger
management problems."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall's retort: "It was just one more red herring for the
recall people to throw out."</TE>

<HD>No Retrial in McDonald Murder Case</HD>
<DH>Charges against the former Newport Beach attorney are
dismissed. Investigators said he killed a woman and then faked
suicide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin and Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors dismissed murder charges Friday against a former Newport
Beach attorney who investigators claim shot and killed a client's
wife, then faked suicide off the Golden Gate Bridge four years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Less than month after jurors deadlocked in the murder and
attempted robbery trial of Hugh "Randy" McDonald, the Orange County
district attorney's office announced that it was dropping the charges
and would not pursue a second trial. Prosecutors said the murder case
would remain open, however, and authorities could charge McDonald
again if new evidence surfaced.</LD>
<LD>   "We have thoroughly reviewed the case and we do not believe we
will be able to get a unanimous verdict with the present state of the
evidence," said Susan Schroeder, a spokeswoman for the district
attorney's office. "If additional evidence is developed, we may
refile the case in the future."</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors would not say whether they were considering charges
against anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing Friday, McDonald's lawyer urged the judge to dismiss
the charges "with prejudice," a qualification that would prevent him
from being charged again. The judge refused.</TE>
<TE>   "It's over," said defense lawyer Michael Molfetta. "The evidence
has been there for five years and it isn't going to get any
better.... Why hold this as an anvil over Mr. McDonald's head?"</TE>
<TE>   Ten of the 12 jurors favored acquittal for McDonald, saying
prosecutors didn't offer conclusive proof that the attorney shot
33-year-old Janie Pang in the closet of her Villa Park bedroom. Some
jurors believed defense assertions that Pang was the victim of a
professional hit orchestrated by her husband, Danny Pang, a
businessman the FBI said might have ties to the Taiwanese mob. Danny
Pang's attorney, meanwhile, suggested a third man might have
committed the crime.</TE>
<TE>   At his trial, McDonald said he was with a prostitute at the time
of the murder and fled Orange County not as a fugitive, but because
of his stressful life in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The five-week trial centered on a collection of bizarre
circumstances surrounding Pang's May 30, 1997, death. The former
stripper turned stay-at-home mom was killed about noon, when a man in
a suit carrying a briefcase appeared at the door of her home in the
upscale Orange County community.</TE>
<TE>   After a minute or two of discussion, according to witnesses, the
visitor pulled a gun and began chasing Pang. He caught up with her in
her bedroom and shot her with a .380-caliber semiautomatic. Pang's
son, a maid and the maid's daughter fled out a back door.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors claimed that McDonald drove to Pang's home because
Danny Pang owed McDonald's law firm $20,000. Of that sum, $4,000 was
owed to McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Several days later, McDonald abruptly left his family and staged
an elaborate suicide, prosecutors alleged.</TE>
<TE>   Having told his wife he was traveling to the Bay Area for
business, McDonald placed his watch and business card on a ledge of
the Golden Gate Bridge. He also mailed cassette tapes to his wife and
son that suggested he was going to kill himself. But McDonald headed
to Utah, where he began a new life. He was arrested four years later.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald could not be reached for comment Friday, but Molfetta
said his client was happy the matter was over.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, his father, Gordon McDonald, 84, of Fullerton,
said his son was innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "They had nothing that pointed to Randy," McDonald said. "They
just charged him with everything. It was all pipe dreams. There was
no way he could be a murderer."</TE>
<TE>   The elder McDonald did not appear in court during the trial
because of a heart condition but got daily briefings from his son.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so intense," Gordon McDonald said. "Now he's just
beginning to relax."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon McDonald said he believes Danny Pang was responsible for
his wife's murder.</TE>
<TE>   But Pang's attorney, William Baker, disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Danny had nothing to do with the murder," Baker said. "Where's
the evidence? Why do [the police] hopscotch from one person to
another after they lose a conviction?"</TE>
<TE>   Baker believes the killer was a stalker who knew Janie Pang during
her stripper days.</TE>
<TE>   Baker said Danny Pang has been interviewed repeatedly and would
have nothing new to provide to police.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy for Randy and his family," Baker said. "It's good
news for Randy, but it's frustrating news for everyone else, because
somewhere in the world, the murderer is sitting and laughing because
he got away."</TE>

<HD>Moorpark Race Hardly a Competition</HD>
<DH>Council candidates' positions are so similar, there's no
basis for animosity. Two of the three will be elected. Mayor runs
unopposed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Ventura County's youngest city approaches its 20th birthday,
politics in Moorpark has calmed a bit.</LD>
<LD>   After a bitter City Council contest in 2000 when two incumbents
lost, Mayor Patrick Hunter is running unopposed this time. Just three
candidates are seeking two available council seats -- and they are
all being very polite about it.</LD>
<LD>   Among the candidates is a 10-year council veteran who has taken
the uncommon step of endorsing his challengers.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought the only fair thing to do was endorse both of them,"
said Councilman Clint Harper, 55, a member of Moorpark's initial
council in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "To endorse only one suggests one is not qualified to be on the
council," Harper said, "and I'd be pleased to serve with either one
of them. I've told people ... that either two you pick will do a good
job, so you can't go wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Former council member Bernardo Perez, 53, figures this campaign is
"generally slow and quiet" because the candidates have so much in
common.</TE>
<TE>   "You have three individuals who are issue-oriented, who have been
around, working in the community," said Perez, a project manager with
Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit housing agency. "I
don't think there's any animosity, period. So there's none to carry
over to our campaign effort."</TE>
<TE>   The top two vote-getters will win council seats.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign issues in this fast-growing bedroom community of 33,000
include reducing truck traffic along California 118; attracting jobs
and commercial development, including upscale stores and restaurants;
and increasing the number of dwellings available for residents with
modest incomes to buy or rent.</TE>
<TE>   All the candidates endorse so-called smart growth, which clusters
homes near jobs and de-emphasizes the automobile. They also want to
cut red tape at City Hall, while improving the quality of new homes
and stores built in town.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike council candidates in neighboring Simi Valley and Thousand
Oaks, Moorpark's contenders are spending little money to get their
names and messages out.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commissioner Janice Parvin, the third council candidate,
spent less than $3,300 through Oct. 19, according to spending
reports. Perez had spent $2,900, Harper about $3,200 and Hunter
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Parvin's primary strategy since July has been to knock on the
doors of thousands of potential voters.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know how many hills we have in Moorpark until you start
walking the town," she said. "I really did lose 16 pounds since the
campaign started."</TE>
<TE>   Director of human resources for a Thousand Oaks company, Parvin,
48, thinks city officials should meet regularly with the Chamber of
Commerce to brainstorm ideas for supporting local companies and
bringing new ones to town.</TE>
<TE>   As former chairwoman of Moorpark's Parks and Recreation
Commission, she said "greenbelts and open space are near and dear to
me." She wants bike trails expanded to link Moorpark, Simi Valley and
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, a councilman on and off from 1987 to 1998, is a longtime
supporter of low-cost housing.</TE>
<TE>   Now he wants the city to build a community swimming pool near
Moorpark High School, work with federal officials to expand the post
office on Los Angeles Avenue and provide more financial help for the
nonprofit Moorpark Food Pantry, which is seeking a permanent home.</TE>
<TE>   Like Parvin, Perez suggests the city should work better with
homeowners by speeding up building plan evaluations, inspections and
the permitting process.</TE>
<TE>   Harper, a Moorpark College physics and astronomy instructor, is
running for what he said would be his final term. He hopes to
continue monitoring the city's efforts to revive its downtown,
including construction of a new City Hall and police station.</TE>
<TE>   But his most important continuing role may be as a city negotiator
with Messenger Investment Co., an Orange County firm that failed in
its 10-year effort to build a 3,200-home community north of town.</TE>
<TE>   The company is now proposing a downsized project with half the
number of homes, a 2,200-acre nature preserve and a large man-made
lake.</TE>
<TE>   Harper and Councilwoman Roseann Mikos helped lead the fight
against Messenger's huge Hidden Creek Ranch project four years ago.
The project was eventually rejected by voters, but only after the
City Council had approved it.</TE>
<TE>   "They realize this has got to be very attractive to the community
or nobody is going to vote for it," Harper said.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, extending his decade-long council stint, is assured of a
fourth, two-year term as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "Running unopposed is a very humbling experience," Hunter said.
"It's an indication that residents are satisfied with the direction
the city has taken. It makes me want to work that much harder."</TE>

<HD>Funding for Area Councils Has to Wait</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An attempt to push through $3 million for neighborhood councils
before Tuesday's election on Valley and Hollywood secession fell one
vote short Friday in the Los Angeles City Council.</LD>
<LD>   The council had scheduled a special meeting to approve the
long-awaited funding, but only 11 council members were present to act
on the appropriation, which needed 12 votes for approval on first
reading. As a result, though the council voted 11-0 to approve the
motion, it must consider the matter again next Friday on second
reading, when only eight votes are required.</LD>
<LD>   Sandy Enfield, chairwoman of the Woodland Hills/Warner Center
Neighborhood Council, said she was disappointed the money was not
approved, but was glad some action was taken.</LD>
<TE>   "It's about time," Enfield said. "It's going to allow us to go
forward without having to use our own addresses and our own phone
numbers and our own money."</TE>
<TE>   Enfield, one of several proponents of the funding at the council
meeting, said she and others have spent $1,100 of their own money
organizing their council, which has been the only one in the city to
endorse secession.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have touted the advisory councils, which are
elected by their communities, as an alternative to secession. But,
three years after being approved by voters, the councils have been
slow to get started. The city has certified 55 neighborhood councils,
but only 18 have elected a board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   In response to claims by secession leaders that the councils are
powerless, city officials proposed that each become eligible for as
much as $50,000 for expenses as well as community improvement
projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The time has come for neighborhood councils to receive their
funding," said City Council President Alex Padilla, who scheduled the
special council vote. "We've all been committed to empowerment of
neighborhood councils and we are putting our money where our mouth
is."</TE>

<LD>Just another reason to be proud you live in Southern California:
Among those honored in the 2003 Guinness Book of Records is Joe
Hermann, who lifted two standard 2-pound, 4.8-ounce steam irons with
his earlobes, picked up a 9-pound battery with his tongue and
"supported the weight of a 15-pound, 11.2-ounce cinder block with his
nipples ... in Los Angeles."</LD>
<LD>   And if he was on Hollywood Boulevard, I bet no one noticed.</LD>
<LD>   A commuter who forgot something? The Huntington Beach Independent
said that "a man was reported to be driving a pickup truck completely
naked at 8:43 a.m."</LD>
<TE>   Grow up! I've heard the phrase "career student," but the concept
was taken to an extreme in an ad spotted by Emily Schroeder of
Camarillo (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Today's Daring Dining Special: Not sure whether it's a typo or a
term that doesn't translate so well into English. But whatever the
bean dish is, S. Moore of Long Beach decided against trying it (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Fuel for thought: Rosemary LeForte of Huntington Beach saw an
offer that wouldn't appeal to parents unless they read the small
print (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   It's a joke, I think: I came across a gift catalog for lawyers --
no, really, there is such a thing -- and it included one item that
would be in keeping with the profession's image (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Names that fit the job: Bob Abrahams of L.A. points out that David
Poltrack is an audience research executive at CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Names that DON'T fit the job: Don Barrett's laradio.com Web site
says that the radio broadcaster for the San Francisco Giants is Joe
Angel.</TE>
<TE>   Role-playing? I have no idea whether it's true that alleged
shoplifter Winona Ryder told a store official she was researching a
role on that subject when she was arrested. But I was reminded of an
experience of a chum of mine in college.</TE>
<TE>   He persuaded an acquaintance to take a placement exam for him to
fulfill his foreign language requirement, only to have the ruse
discovered by test officials. My chum explained that he was not
trying to cheat -- he was researching a campus newspaper piece on how
easy it was to hire subs for such tests.</TE>
<TE>   The school levied some penalties against him -- I think he was
forbidden from running for homecoming king, etc. -- but at least he
wasn't expelled.</TE>
<TE>   He did write the article. And he went on to become a successful
comedy writer in Holly- wood.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: Comic Craig Kilborn said that Angel fans greeted
Edison Field spectator John Travolta with a huge ovation during the
World Series because they realized that every minute he was at a game
he was "not making 'Battlefield Earth 2.' "</TE>

<HD>Nina Sails the Ocean Blue as Teaching Ship in 2002</HD>
<DH>Replica of Columbus' vessel and its informed crew are
docked in Oxnard for tours.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It first hit Allison Asher when she was tending bar at a place called
Zuber's Marina Grill and Pub on a bulge in the upper Mississippi
called Lake Pepin.</LD>
<LD>   That's when she got the urge to take a break from setting up shots
and beers for Sunday sailors in Lake City, Minn. That also happened
to be when the winds of fate blew a life-size, hand-built replica of
Christopher Columbus' favorite ship, the Nina, to the dock outside
the bar.</LD>
<LD>   "I was just completely excited," she said. "When the first mate
came in to use the phone, I asked him whether someone inexperienced
could get a job. He said sure -- not a lot of people have experience
sailing a square-rigged vessel from the 1400s."</LD>
<TE>   At 32, Asher signed on for a 10-day stint as a crew member. That
was three years ago and she's still aboard, hoisting sails, pumping
out the bilge and greeting tourists, as she is now doing from the
Nina's berth at Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   The four-masted, broad-bowed ship -- called a caravel by the 15th
century Portuguese shipwrights who designed it -- is moored near the
Ventura County Maritime Museum through Tuesday. Walk-aboard tours are
offered for $4; $3 for students; and $3.50 for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   As a cold fog drifted in one recent day, a few of the Nina's 10
crew members huddled below decks, chewing over their days and nights
at sea. In the last few months, they had sailed in a Canadian
tall-ship festival, and in a few days they would be bound for the
Panama Canal and home port in the Cayman Islands.</TE>
<TE>   They recalled when 22-foot waves roared out of the Caribbean and
surged over the decks, and when the Nina snagged on an Intercoastal
Waterway sandbar in Florida, requiring the U.S. Coast Guard to rescue
a bit of mud-mired history. They remembered the day the ship pulled
in at a tiny Costa Rican coastal village to stock up on food as
incredulous local fishermen gaped at the seemingly ancient tub.</TE>
<TE>   In every port, from Brazil to British Columbia and along interior
rivers to places as landlocked as Muskogee, Okla., there have been
the tourists and their questions. Are there ghosts on board? How did
you get here -- did you fly this ship in? Are we floating right now?</TE>
<TE>   Crew members can field most queries the landlubbers toss their
way. On long nights between ports, they are intensively schooled in
Columbus arcana.</TE>
<TE>   Were there women aboard in Columbus' day? Not on the first voyage,
Asher immediately responds, but there were two gypsies named Catalina
and Maria on a later voyage.</TE>
<TE>   And where is the original Nina now? Nobody knows, crew members
say. It was last heard of in 1501, as it wended its way toward
Venezuela's Pearl Coast on a trading expedition.</TE>
<TE>   With Columbus viewed in some quarters as the first of the
merciless European land-grabbers, the Nina's crew tries to steer wide
of controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't even say that Columbus discovered America," Asher said.
"There were others before him. We only say that he discovered a new
trade route -- and changed the world."</TE>
<TE>   On Columbus' epic voyage in 1492, the crew included freed
convicts, impressed seamen, a priest, a physician, a historian, a
translator who could communicate with the people of Cathay and India,
and even a lawyer who could issue proclamations fit for their
princes.</TE>
<TE>   On the modern Nina, the crew includes adventurers who saw an ad
and came aboard for weeks or months, willing to tolerate low pay,
cramped quarters, wet clothing and sleep interrupted by the required
four-hour watches.</TE>
<TE>   Interested in travel, 41-year-old crewman Norm Faber left his dog
with his parents in the Bay Area and signed on in Morro Bay. "I've
got my sea legs from eight years on tugboats," he said, gazing up at
a web of lines protected with a thick coating of tar and linseed oil.
"But this is no tug. It's all Greek to me."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Columbus himself would be totally at sea aboard the
ersatz Nina. His Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria had no iceboxes, propane
stoves or VCRs; no electrical navigation aids for when a sextant
won't do; and no six-cylinder Mercedes Benz diesel engine for when
the winds won't cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   And in port, there were no students, retirees or curious yachtsmen
swarming over the main decks.</TE>
<TE>   Just 67 feet long, the Nina isn't that much bigger than some of
the craft tied nearby. But a small ship can be a big adventure for a
little boy like Roy Angulo.</TE>
<TE>   An Oxnard first-grader, he was aboard last week, and all over
every nook and cranny open to the public. He peered underneath a
canvas covering at the ship's inflatable life raft, gazed raptly at a
20-minute video on the Nina's travels, and squinted through a wooden
grate into the hold where Columbus suspended live cows and pigs in
slings.</TE>
<TE>   "He just finished studying Columbus in school and was so excited
when we told him that we'd visit the ship," said Roy's grandmother,
Cecilia Cerrutti. "There might not be much to see, but you really get
the feel of just how small it really was. It helps you put the
history in perspective."</TE>
<TE>   That was exactly why the Columbus Foundation, a group based in the
British Virgin Islands, decided to build the Nina replica in the
first place. Construction took three years, with Brazilian
shipwrights using only the axes and adzes typical of Columbus' era.
The look of the ship evolved from scholarly guesswork. No paintings
of it remain, and plans for ships of the day were not set down in
writing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Nina tries to hew to history as it's known through
contemporary accounts. Nobody aboard ties the common bowline knot,
for instance, because they believe it was unknown in the late 1400s.
And they steer the Nina with a tiller instead of a wheel, because the
ship's wheel wasn't common for another century.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, authenticity goes only so far. Because the hold was
crammed with provisions, the 27 crew members on the original Nina all
slept on the drenched, tar-smeared deck, with the lucky few finding
soft spots on coils of rope. Like other sailors of the day, they
caught scurvy from a lack of vitamin C. Today's crew likes to dine on
chicken Caesar salad with garlic toast.</TE>
<TE>   But hands such as 19-year-old Patrick McGohey feel a certain
thrill despite the Nina's modern conveniences. McGohey was living
with his father aboard a boat in Oceanside when he heard the Nina's
call.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never driven a car," he said with an air of wonder, "but I
can sail a 15th century caravel."</TE>

<HD>Newly Released Owens River Plan Envisions Restored Stream,
Wetlands</HD>
<DH>Long-delayed report tells how DWP intends to revive the
nearly dry waterway by early 2004.</DH>

<LD>A long-delayed plan to put water back into the lower Owens River in
the eastern Sierra reached its first major milestone Friday with the
release of an environmental study of the project. Officials hope to
have the water flowing by early 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The lengthy environmental report explains how the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power plans to restore flows to 62 miles of
meandering river that have been reduced to a trickle since 1913, when
the DWP began diverting the lower Owens to Los Angeles through an
aqueduct.</LD>
<LD>   The study offers a preview of the river snaking back and forth
across the Valley floor, nourishing a burgeoning forest of willows
and cottonwoods along its banks. The restored flows are to be small
but steady, unlike the temperamental old river, which flooded
occasionally. The flows are to be increased each spring to replenish
wetlands along the river's banks.</LD>
<TE>   A major dispute remains, however, over how much water will
ultimately be pumped back into the aqueduct and not allowed to reach
the Owens River delta, where the river spills into the dry Owens Lake
bed in Inyo County. The delta is considered an important stopover for
migratory birds.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the plan is unusual because there are few if any
other cities in the arid West willing to sacrifice a significant
chunk of their water supply for such a project.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering the magnitude and scope of this plan, I think this is
something that the city of Los Angeles should be very proud of," said
Leah Kirk, a projects coordinator for the Inyo County Water
Department, which co-wrote the study with the DWP.</TE>
<TE>   Restoring the flows will cost the DWP about 30,000 acre-feet of
water each year, enough to supply 60,000 families. To make up for the
loss, the DWP may have to increase the amount of water it purchases
from the Metropolitan Water District, the principal water wholesaler
for Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The lower Owens project has been racked with controversy since it
was first conceived in 1991 as mitigation for excessive groundwater
pumping by the DWP in the Owens Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The study was initially due in June 2000 but was delayed numerous
times when DWP and Inyo County officials couldn't agree on details.
This fall, an Inyo County judge ordered the study to be released by
Friday after two environmental groups, the Sierra Club and the Owens
Valley Committee, filed a suit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're excited about it, although we think it may be an ugly
baby," said the committee's Mike Prather, who fears there won't be
enough water to sustain the delta. But he also praised the project,
saying higher flows and newly forested riverbanks will offer quality
habitat for several types of fish, dozens of bird species, and deer
and tule elk.</TE>
<TE>   A final environmental study is due next spring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to finally see this coming to fruition," said Clarence
Martin, a water engineer with the DWP in the Owens Valley. "I don't
know of anywhere in the West or anywhere in the world where a project
is going to put water back into a river that hasn't had water for
nearly a century."</TE>

<HD>Americans' Views of Islam Dim, Poll Finds</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>More Americans have unfavorable views of Islam today than at the
start of 2002, a new ABC News/Beliefnet poll has found.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-three percent said they have an unfavorable opinion of the
religion, compared with 24% in January.</LD>
<LD>   Another finding from the poll indicates that a growing percentage
of Americans also think Islam doesn't teach respect for other faiths.
In January 22% held that view, but the new poll shows that 35% say
that.</LD>
<TE>   Likewise, a higher percentage of U.S. residents think Islam
encourages violence, with 23% saying so in the new poll compared with
14% agreeing to that sentiment last winter.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-three percent of those surveyed said they do not think
they have a basic understanding of Islam's beliefs and teachings, an
increase from 61% at the start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found a divergence of opinion about Islam between
nonevangelical and evangelical white Protestants. Among evangelicals,
31% had a favorable view of Islam and 45% were unfavorable. Among
nonevangelicals, opinion was favorable, 48% to 23%.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, conducted by telephone Oct. 11-15, called a random
national sample of 1,018 adults. It has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Affirms Better Relations With Jews</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>A top Vatican cardinal has reaffirmed that the Roman Catholic Church
remains committed to continued improvement in relations with Jews.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech marking the anniversary of a major Second Vatican
Council document on Catholic-Jewish relations, Cardinal Walter
Kasper, the Vatican official in charge of relations with Jews, told a
conference of prelates and rabbis that after 2,000 years of
antagonism, Catholics and Jews may still disagree -- but that they do
so as brothers.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe on some issues they will let us down or we will let them
down. But fraternity is precisely this contact, where one listens to
the heart of the other as if it were his own heart," Kasper said.</LD>
<TE>   The conference commemorated the 37th anniversary of the document
Nostra Aetate, Latin for In Our Time, which was drafted during the
Second Vatican Council, the 1962-65 meeting that modernized the
church.</TE>
<TE>   In it, the Vatican deplored anti-Semitism in every form and
repudiated the "deicide" charge that blamed Jews as a people for
Christ's crucifixion. The document affirmed that Jesus, the apostles
and most of his early followers were Jews, and that God has not
revoked his covenant with Jews.</TE>
<TE>   The anniversary was celebrated amid debate over a recent
unofficial document saying it is no longer theologically acceptable
for the church to target Jews for conversion.</TE>
<TE>   The document was drafted by a group of American Catholic and
Jewish scholars and published on the Web site of the U.S. Conference
of Catholic Bishops, which had appointed the group along with the
National Council of Synagogues.</TE>
<TE>   "In view of our conviction that Jews are in an eternal covenant
with God, we renounce missionary efforts directed at converting
Jews," the scholars wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The document, which made headlines when it was released Aug. 12,
prompted a recent rebuttal by Cardinal Avery Dulles, a top American
theologian, who argued that Catholics had a God-given right and duty
to convert Jews as well as anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we grant that there are some persons for whom it is not
important to acknowledge Christ, to be baptized and to receive the
sacraments, we raise questions about our own religious life," Dulles
wrote in the Oct. 21 issue of America, the Jesuit magazine.</TE>
<TE>   A top Jewish scholar, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, said at the
conference that prejudices remain and that the Catholic Church is in
an "almost impossible" position when it comes to dealing with the
Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to be somebody's heir when he's still alive,"
Steinsaltz told the audience of academics, students and Catholic and
Jewish representatives.</TE>

<HD>Chevrolet Sponsorship of Music Tour Criticized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chevrolet's national sponsorship of a Christian music tour has caused
controversy, with some faith leaders -- and leaders of no faith --
saying the mix of corporate and Christian interests is inappropriate.</LD>
<LD>   The "Come Together and Worship" tour, which began this week in
Atlanta, includes three well-known names in evangelical Christian
circles: musicians Third Day and Michael W. Smith and author Max
Lucado.</LD>
<LD>   Although black gospel music tours, such as one earlier this year
featuring the Winans family, have had secular corporate sponsors, the
16-city "Come Together" tour marks a new phase in support of the
predominantly white contemporary Christian music industry, said Frank
Breeden, president of the Gospel Music Assn.</LD>
<TE>   "This is more than just simple niche marketing," said Tony
Hileman, executive director of the Washington-based American Humanist
Assn. "It represents a significant entry into the culture war by a
major corporation."</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolet and organizations linked to contemporary Christian
artists say the sponsorship is simply good business.</TE>
<TE>   "It recognizes the growing importance of contemporary Christian
music to millions of Americans, especially in the Southeastern United
States," said Tom Wilkinson, director of communications for the
Detroit-based Chevrolet Motor Division.</TE>

<DL>STORNOWAY, Scotland</DL>
<LD>A 34-seat propeller plane landed at tiny Stornoway airport Sunday --
the first Sabbath flight to the Isle of Lewis, a staunchly
Presbyterian island off Scotland's northwest coast.</LD>
<LD>   Church leaders urged islanders to boycott the Sunday flights and
preserve a traditional way of life that includes strict Sabbath
observance.</LD>
<LD>   The flights "are a breach of God's law and will have an adverse
effect on the whole community life of this island as we know it,"
said Calum Maclean, a local representative of the Lord's Day
Observance Society.</LD>
<TE>   Lewis, a wind-battered island in the Outer Hebrides with a
population of 22,000, is the spiritual home of the Free Church of
Scotland, which allows work only of "necessity and mercy" on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, swings in children's playgrounds were chained on
Sundays to prevent them from being used.</TE>
<TE>   The 22 passengers were greeted by 50 to 60 protesters gathered
behind a placard reading, "Remember the Sabbath Day, to Keep It Holy"
-- and by 200 to 300 well-wishers who welcomed them with cheers,
embraces and handshakes.</TE>

<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati is criticizing a new
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. research policy that does not ban use of stem
cells taken from human embryos.</LD>
<LD>   P&amp;G does not use human embryo cells and has no plans to do so, but
its new policy, which went into effect in October, does not rule out
their use, a company spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The archdiocese's newspaper published a statement from Archbishop
Daniel Pilarczyk saying the policy is "a misuse of human life no
matter how praiseworthy its intent might be."</LD>
<TE>   The church does not object to research on stem cells from
consenting adults, but it says using embryo or fetal tissue is
morally wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Stem cells form in the first days of embryonic development, and
later differentiate into the many types of cells needed to form
organs and other tissues.</TE>
<TE>   The unspecialized stem cells also are found in some adult tissues.</TE>

Angeles' Eastside has sparked an emotional dispute between a group of
Cantonese-speaking Presbyterians and the denomination's regional
governing body.</LD>
<LD>   The Presbytery of San Gabriel wants to sell the church on Griffin
Avenue in Lincoln Heights to a 300-member Korean immigrant
Presbyterian congregation currently in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   But leaders of the Chinese congregation, which has roots going
back 126 years, say the sale would destroy a religious mission that
remains important for the area's Chinese population.</LD>
<TE>   In a clash of divergent world perspectives, both sides are, in
effect, accusing the other of being out of touch.</TE>
<TE>   "They have no compassion for what we are doing," said Irvin Lai, a
leader of the Lincoln Heights Neighborhood Ministry, which is made up
mostly of low-income immigrants who worship at the old True Light
Chinese Presbyterian Church building.</TE>
<TE>   Lai, an elder and member of the church since 1958, said the
presbytery's decision puts financial considerations above "saving
souls for the Lord."</TE>
<TE>   Those opposing the sale consider the Lincoln Heights site "holy
ground" because in many cases their loved ones were baptized and
married there and remembered at the church when they died.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the presbytery, by contrast, say they intend to
continue the mission, but at a more affordable location.</TE>
<TE>   The current church is "too much building for what's going on,"
said the Rev. Thomas G. Rennard, top regional administrator for the
body, which governs 45 congregations of the Presbyterian Church USA
in northeastern Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Valley and surrounding
areas. The presbytery, composed of 180 ministers and 180 elders,
decided after a "rigorous debate" to sell the property, said Rennard.</TE>
<TE>   The ministry is a gathering place for children who have nowhere to
go after school, students needing help with their homework,
Americanized Chinese teenagers alienated from their immigrant
parents, men and women looking for jobs, families in need of a
translator for a medical appointment, recent immigrants learning
English as a second language, and seniors who do aerobics.</TE>
<TE>   One day this week, for example, Christina Marfoe, the ministry's
full-time volunteer, made three trips to the County-USC Medical
Center on behalf of a woman with glaucoma, helped a
Cantonese-speaking man deal with the county bureaucracy over a jury
summons, delivered medication to a family in Lincoln Heights, then
counseled and prayed with a depressed teenager until after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how we show Jesus' love," Marfoe said. "We are his
instruments."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lee, the neighborhood ministry's only paid staff member,
spent the week tutoring students -- an average of 20 a day.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can make a difference in one kid's life and turn him on to
learning, and if I can help him discover the joy of learning, then
I've done what God has called me to do here," said Lee, 25, who has
undergraduate degrees in political science and philosophy from UC
Berkeley and a master's degree in philosophy from Talbot Theological
Seminary.</TE>
<TE>   He also coordinates the ministry's classes in Chinese, English as
a second language, and aerobics for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   But Rennard and the Rev. Peter Lai (no relation to Elder Lai) said
the Lincoln Heights group hasn't been successful. Peter Lai is the
pastor of Alhambra True Light Presbyterian Church, which was
established in 1996 by the merger of True Light with another,
predominately white, congregation in Alhambra.</TE>
<TE>   "The ministry is not growing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At least some outside observers agree that the mission work should
be broadened to be successful in a neighborhood whose population is
now far more Latino than Chinese. According to the 2000 Census, 6,760
Chinese and 26,435 Latinos live in the area where the church is
located.</TE>
<TE>   "There is certainly a need to work for the poor, those on the
margins of society, but it would mean that the Cantonese congregation
in Lincoln Heights would have to reach out to the Hispanics in that
community," said the Rev. Michael Mata, professor of urban ministries
at Claremont School of Theology, who is familiar with the church and
the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is complicated because of the historic and emotional
ties that the larger Cantonese community has to the Lincoln Heights
building, Mata said. The Cantonese dominated Los Angeles' Chinatown
until the influx of ethnic Chinese immigrants from other parts of
Asia since the 1980s diversified the population.</TE>
<TE>   "Losing the facility conjures up all kinds of feelings," Mata
said.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1876 as Chinese Presbyterian Church by the Rev. Ira M.
Condit, a former missionary to China, True Light's history is
synonymous with the history of the Chinese in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Condit began the ministry with children whose parents worked in
Chinatown's laundries, produce markets and restaurants. The parents
were delighted to send their youngsters to Condit for free tutoring
and baby-sitting.</TE>
<TE>   "Little did they realize that God was at work to use those
opportunities as a way to grow a Chinese Presbyterian Church," Pastor
Lai said. "When those children grew up and became Christians, they
became the leaders of the church, and through their witness and
influence, many of their parents were led to Christ," he wrote in a
booklet on the history of the church.</TE>
<TE>   Ian Evison, project director at the Alban Institute, a
nondenominational think tank in Bethesda, Md., said transfers of
ethnic churches from older immigrant communities to newer arrivals
from different ethnic groups are common.</TE>
<TE>   "The trend of congregations moving between ethnic groups is
particularly strong in the Presbyterian church," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Church mergers also are prevalent in the denomination, which
numbered 2.5 million nationwide in 2001 and is losing an average of
30,000 members a year.</TE>
<TE>   The rapid decline of membership among mainline Protestant
denominations has forced churches to "rationalize" their properties
and expenses, said Edmund Gibbs, professor of practical theology at
Fuller Theological Seminary's School of World Missions and an
authority on church growth and renewal.</TE>
<TE>   He said urban ministry is "particularly tough" for such mainline
denominations as Presbyterian churches, because "they are bookish in
their culture" and often fit better in suburban areas.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, "we are not a church where people drive Mercedes,"
Elder Lai said. "We are operating a church fellowship group where
people come with sandals on their feet."</TE>
<TE>   Well-prepared and well-delivered sermons, prized by middle-class
Presbyterian congregations, don't work in his ministry, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't understand theology. We are missionaries. We make it
simple: 'Jesus loves you and he gives you salvation. I am your
friend, just like Jesus Christ is.' "</TE>
<TE>   In most churches, refreshments follow an 11 a.m. worship. But with
Elder Lai's group, a snack of Chinese noodles and Winchell's
doughnuts preceded a recent Sunday service. When Lai announced the
sale, adults and youngsters alike cried.</TE>
<TE>   The presbytery "didn't have the perspective of what we think,"
said a tearful Carmen Ng, 14, a ninth-grader at nearby Bravo High
school. "This is my second home," she said. "I've been coming here
since I was in preschool."</TE>
<TE>   But Florence Shao, an elderly congregant who has been coming to
the church for three years, was more resigned.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we have any say," she said. "I'm sad about it, but
I don't think we have any choice."</TE>

<HD>Muslims Alter Ramadan Giving</HD>
<DH>Charities fear a shortfall as U.S. crackdown on terrorism
makes many people reluctant to donate money to organizations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Omer bin Abdullah won't be leaving a paper trail this year when he
makes his traditional donation to the poor during the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan.</LD>
<LD>   He will fulfill his religious duty by handing cash directly to a
needy family, as will many other American Muslims at a time when
federal investigators are targeting U.S.-based Islamic charities in
the hunt for terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   "People are so scared that they don't know what to do," said
Abdullah, of Herndon, Va.</LD>
<TE>   Islam requires its followers to give 2.5% of their income and
savings to the poor annually, and many do so during Ramadan, which
this year begins Wednesday. But since the Sept. 11 attacks, the
federal government has frozen the assets of three major Muslim
nonprofit groups on suspicion of links with terrorist groups: the
Holy Land Foundation of Richardson, Texas, and Benevolence
International Foundation and Global Relief Foundation, both in the
Chicago area.</TE>
<TE>   Other Muslim charities, which say they have been unfairly tarred
by association, have experienced a significant drop in donations.
That has only heightened the importance of their Ramadan collections
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Two-thirds of our funds come from this month," said Muhammad
Rahman, head of the New York-based international relief arm of the
Islamic Circle of North America. "If we don't make it, that means
next year will be a very tough time."</TE>
<TE>   In Islam, the start of the holy month is based on a lunar calendar
and requires visual sightings of the new crescent moon. The sighting
is expected to come Wednesday. It is the most important time of the
year for Muslims, and also the period when Islamic charities launch
their biggest fund-raising campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Muslim leaders met with President Bush in September,
urging him to take some action so American Muslims feel safer making
donations -- a practice referred to in Islam as zakat, which is one
of the five pillars of the faith. U.S. Muslim leaders are lobbying
for a federal auditing system for Islamic charities, so investigators
and donors can feel confident that no money goes to groups thought to
have terrorist ties.</TE>
<TE>   Without such safeguards, many Muslims fear that sending checks to
their favorite humanitarian organizations will inadvertently make
them suspects in the eyes of law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Ismat Hamid, an industrial pharmacist from Ann Arbor, Mich., said
many Muslims in his community plan to change the way they donate this
year, although he will not. He will send money to U.S.-based Muslim
humanitarian groups that help children in his native Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "American Muslims, they don't want to put themselves in a
situation that is very hard to prove they are innocent," Hamid said.
"After 9/11 in general, the American Muslims are guilty until proven
innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Mercy USA for Aid and Development, an international humanitarian
organization founded by American Muslims, is attempting to address
such concerns. The Michigan nonprofit posted a statement on its Web
site noting that it works with the U.S. Agriculture Department, and
it has enclosed similar statements in its direct mail fund-raising
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The group collects as much as 30% of its private donations for the
year during Ramadan. Umar al-Quadi, Mercy's chief executive, said
giving is down due to the slow economy and donor fear.</TE>
<TE>   "People generally are scared," al-Quadi said.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman, whose organization is known as ICNA Relief-Helping Hand,
said donations to his group have dropped by about one-third due to
concern about government investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying the campaign the same way we did last time," Rahman
said of his organization's holiday appeal. "But, the point is, people
totally shy away."</TE>
<TE>   Altaf Bukhari, a Muslim and civil engineer in Tampa, Fla., used to
donate to Global Relief and said he has received solicitations from
them to help defray their defense costs in their legal battle with
the government. He hasn't sent any money so far.</TE>
<TE>   For his Ramadan donation, he plans to collect money for an
ambulance that will be used to help refugees in his native India,
possibly by sending the money directly to a group in that country.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intention is to only make sure that the right people get the
money," Bukhari said.</TE>

<HD>Broad Donates to Bond Effort</HD>
<DH>The philanthropist gives $1.19 million and lends $1 million
to Measure A drive to improve county cultural facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philanthropist Eli Broad has given $1.19 million and lent $1 million
to the campaign for Measure A, an earthquake and fire safety bond
measure that would provide $250 million in capital improvement funds
to cultural facilities, including the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   In filings with the county clerk, backers of the measure reported
a Broad contribution of $1,189,027.14 on Oct. 15. He made the
$1-million loan nine days later.</LD>
<LD>   The pro-Measure A forces had raised $4.9 million in contributions
and loans through late October.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the campaign's spending has gone for mailers and 30-second
television spots, which began running on several stations in
mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A's opponents have spent nothing, according to county
records.</TE>
<TE>   Under the ballot item's provisions, the county would provide $98
million each to LACMA and the Natural History Museum, but each
institution would have to privately raise $112.5 million in matching
funds by November 2012.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $54 million in bond money would be distributed among
cultural facilities around the county, including performing arts
facilities to be built at Cal State Northridge and in the San Gabriel
Valley, and a cultural arts complex planned for El Pueblo de Los
Angeles historic district downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those projects require privately raised matching funds to
release the bond money.</TE>
<TE>   The measure needs two-thirds voter approval to pass, a target that
was beyond the reach of most initiatives in the last round of county
and state elections.</TE>
<TE>   For the owner of a $250,000 home, passage of Measure A would mean
a property tax boost of $6.96 in the first year, with the amount
steadily declining over the next 29 years.</TE>
<TE>   Broad, chairman of Sun-america Corp. and a longtime donor to local
cultural causes, has already hinted that he'll be handing over more
than $23 million to help LACMA in its plan to raze most of its
buildings and put up a new complex designed by Dutch architect Rem
Koolhaas.</TE>
<TE>   Museum officials say it's too early in the design process to give
a solid figure for the effort's cost, but museum sources have cited
$300 million as a ballpark figure.</TE>
<TE>   The Natural History Museum, subject to several additions and
renovations over the decades, was built in 1913.</TE>
<TE>   Officials plan a renovation and expansion with a tentative price
tag of $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   In ballot arguments over the measure, backers stress that the
capital spending would boost earthquake and fire safety.</TE>
<TE>   In opposing the measure, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. argues
that the bond issue would be a cultural subsidy in disguise.</TE>
<TE>   No building at LACMA predates 1960, and no building at either
museum has been restricted because of unsafe conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Other donations to the campaign for Measure A include $1.95
million from Museum Associates (a private, nonprofit group associated
with LACMA); $500,000 from the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural
History Foundation; $100,000 from former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan; $25,000 from Newport Beach developer and philanthropist
Donald Bren; and $5,000 from Bank of America.</TE>

<HD>Frank Rosenberg, 88; Producer Gave Brando His Only Outing
as Director</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank P. Rosenberg, whose many projects during a six-decade Hollywood
career included producing the only film directed by Marlon Brando,
died Oct. 18 in Thousand Oaks after a short illness. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Rosenberg produced "One-Eyed Jacks," a 1961 psychological western
in which Brando was the director and star. Rosenberg also was the
producer of "Madigan," the gritty, 1968 New York police drama that
starred Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda.</LD>
<LD>   Known for his ability to recognize screenwriting talent, Rosenberg
hired Sam Peckinpah to write the first draft of the "One-Eyed Jacks"
screenplay. It was the first effort at feature film writing by
Peckinpah, who became a director.</LD>
<TE>   Rosenberg also gave Jayne Mansfield her first movie role -- in the
1955 film "Illegal," which starred Edward G. Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Rosenberg began a lifelong fascination
with show business when his mother, an avid theatergoer, took him to
his first Broadway play.</TE>
<TE>   At the age of 16, a few years after the first "talkies" were
released, he had a job in the shipping department at Columbia
Pictures in New York. He worked his way up and eventually ran
national publicity and advertising for the studio and its fabled
chief, Harry Cohn.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946 Cohn transferred him to Hollywood to run the publicity
office. By 1951, Rosenberg had struck out on his own as an
independent producer and began to make pictures for Cohn, Darryl F.
Zanuck, Jack L. Warner and Lew Wasserman. He worked with stars such
as Tab Hunter and Tyrone Power as producer of "The Secret of Convict
Lake," "King of the Khyber Rifles" and "The Girl He Left Behind."</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, Rosenberg bought the rights to Charles Neider's western
novel "The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones." The producer worked
briefly with writer Rod Serling on an adaptation before turning the
material over to Peckinpah, a dialogue director who was eager for his
first feature writing credit.</TE>
<TE>   When Peckinpah finished his draft of the movie that would become
"One-Eyed Jacks," Rosenberg sent it to Brando, who, to Rosenberg's
shock, agreed to star in it.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg often told stories of the frustration and hilarity of
working with Brando during the making of the film.</TE>
<TE>   Brando played an outlaw seeking revenge on a former
friend-turned-sheriff, played by Karl Malden.</TE>
<TE>   The director was Stanley Kubrick, who was already being hailed as
a genius for his World War I drama "Paths of Glory."</TE>
<TE>   But Brando, who identified strongly with the film's main
characters, involved himself in nearly every aspect of its
production.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the summer of 1958, script meetings shifted to Marlon's
Mulholland Drive house, where, because of the teakwood floors, no one
was allowed to wear shoes," Peter Manso wrote in his 1994 biography,
"Brando." "Kubrick, for some reason, routinely took off his pants as
well and worked in only his underwear and dress shirt."</TE>
<TE>   "Brando," Rosenberg told Manso, "sat cross-legged on the floor
within easy reach of a Chinese gong, and when the discussions became
too emotional, he would hit it."</TE>
<TE>   Brando, whose special arrangement with Paramount gave him enormous
clout, wound up firing Peckinpah, and later Kubrick. Rosenberg,
according to Manso, reluctantly agreed to let Brando take over the
directing.</TE>
<TE>   Filming on the Monterey coast, the actor fell months behind
schedule as he grappled with the basics. By the time he wrapped up
principal photography, he had shot more than 1 million feet of film
-- six times the average -- and had exceeded the $1.6-million budget
by more than $4 million, according to Manso.</TE>
<TE>   "Time and tide are costly in Hollywood, and Brando used both
unstintingly in his efforts to get just what he wanted on the
screen," Rosenberg told the New York Times in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   When Brando turned in a 4 1/2-hour director's cut, Rosenberg said,
according to Manso, "That's not a picture. That's just an assemblage
of footage."</TE>
<TE>   The studio obtained control of the film and ultimately released a
141-minute version that earned some rave reviews, particularly for
its visual beauty and rich characterizations.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg produced several more films over the next few decades.</TE>
<TE>   Among them, "Madigan" was memorable for Widmark's classic
portrayal of a tough, urban detective.</TE>
<TE>   "The Reincarnation of Peter Proud" was a 1975 movie in which
Michael Sarrazin played a man possessed by the soul of a murder
victim.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg is survived by his wife of 49 years, Maryanne; two sons,
James, a forensic psychiatrist, and John, a film editor; and five
grandchildren. A third son, Daniel, an actor and entertainment
lawyer, died last year.</TE>
<TE>   Services were held last Sunday at Hillside Memorial Park in Culver
City.</TE>

<HD>Woman Denies Killing Husband</HD>
<DH>The former toxicologist testifies that spouse threatened to
expose her affair with her boss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A former toxicologist accused of poisoning her husband testified
Friday that she never planned to kill him, even though he threatened
to expose her drug use and her affair with her boss.</LD>
<LD>   "Were these threats so serious that you planned to take your
husband's life?" defense attorney Alex Loebig asked his client,
Kristin Rossum.</LD>
<LD>   "Absolutely not," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Rossum, 26, is accused of murdering Greg de Villers on Nov. 6,
2000. He died from a massive dose of the painkiller fentanyl, which
prosecutors say Rossum stole from the San Diego County medical
examiner's office, where she worked. They also allege that she stole
methamphetamine for her drug habit.</TE>
<TE>   The defense claims that De Villers, 26, killed himself. But
investigators allege that Rossum tried to make the death look like a
suicide, and placed rose petals around his body to mimic a scene from
"American Beauty," her favorite film.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum fielded mostly friendly questions from her public defender
in her second day on the stand. Her answers were polite and she
rarely cried, as she had done throughout much of her testimony the
day before.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors plan to cross-examine her Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum said she began using meth in high school. But she said her
life turned around a couple of years later, when she met De Villers
in December 1994. He helped her kick the drug, and she said she
graduated with honors in chemistry from San Diego State University.
They married in June 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum said she had second thoughts about marrying De Villers, but
dismissed her doubts as pre-wedding jitters. They were happy for the
first six months of their marriage, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But as Rossum started to gain more independence, she said, De
Villers reacted by becoming more "clingy." In June 2000, she began a
sexual relationship with her boss, Michael Robertson, head of the
toxicology lab at the medical examiner's office. Rossum said she told
her husband about the affair soon after it began. De Villers was
irate, she said, and called Robertson at home to demand that he end
the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "He was devastated," Rossum said of De Villers. "There was a
period where he basically went to bed for a couple of days and
wouldn't talk to me, not to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   The affair continued for a few months. By October, Rossum had
taken up methamphetamine again. Just days before his death, she said,
De Villers wrestled her to the floor when he saw her reading an old
love note from Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   She quickly put it through a paper shredder, she said, but De
Villers spent hours with tweezers trying to piece it back together.
Rossum said she believed he wanted to use it as evidence of her
affair. The morning of her husband's death, she said, his speech was
slurred. She called his office and left a message saying he wouldn't
be at work that day.</TE>
<TE>   She went home from work during the day to have lunch with him.
When she checked on him that night, she said, he was cold to the
touch and she called 911. Police drove her to the hospital, where she
was told that De Villers was dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I was devastated. I had lost my best friend," Rossum said. "I
still love him. I still miss him."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson and Rossum were fired in December 2000. Robertson, who
has not been charged, has returned to his native Australia and is not
expected to testify.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Rossum could face life in prison without the
possibility of parole.</TE>

<HD>Saks Manager Planned to Lie, Former Worker Says</HD>
<DH>Security supervisor vowed to get Ryder 'one way or
another,' he says. D.A. calls witness a disgruntled employee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Saks Fifth Avenue employee testified Friday that a key
prosecution witness in the shoplifting trial of Winona Ryder said
soon after the arrest that he planned to lie in order to help convict
the film star.</LD>
<LD>   Former employee Michael Shoar, one of four witnesses called by
Ryder's lawyer as he presented the actress' defense, said he had
lunch with Saks security manager Kenneth Evans after Ryder's arrest
in December and that Evans told him he wanted to "bring her down --
one way or another."</LD>
<LD>   Under cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle suggested
that Shoar was a disgruntled ex-employee. Shoar acknowledged that he
held a protest in front of the Beverly Hills department store last
month and plans to file a civil lawsuit against the company.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Mark Geragos also called two Beverly Hills police
officers and the spokeswoman for the district attorney's office to
the witness stand Friday.</TE>
<TE>   At day's end, Geragos said he was considering calling Ryder to
testify in her own defense before he rests his case Monday. Geragos
said Ryder, 31, wants to take the witness stand "in the worst way,"
but he believes he has already created reasonable doubt in jurors'
minds that would result in a verdict of not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors are expected to hear closing arguments in the case Monday.
The Oscar-nominated actress is charged with grand theft, burglary and
vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder has avoided talking to crowds of reporters during the trial
that began last week but signed autographs for two teenage fans
Friday afternoon. "Lots and lots of love and peace," read one of her
notes.</TE>
<TE>   On the witness stand Friday, Shoar testified that he had two brief
conversations with Evans about the case, once on the telephone and
once during a lunch in Beverly Hills. Shoar said Evans was anxious
and nervous during lunch and said that he wanted to "nail that rich
Beverly Hills bitch on shoplifting charges," Shoar testified.</TE>
<TE>   Evans, who was the first prosecution witness, had denied making
such statements to Shoar when he was cross-examined by Geragos
earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   Evans told jurors that he followed Ryder on surveillance cameras
and watched her walk out of the store with more than $5,500 in stolen
merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   He also testified that he later found four sensor tags that
matched items found in Ryder's possession in a jacket in the Chanel
department of the store and that Ryder said she took items as
research for a film role.</TE>
<TE>   In his testimony Friday, Shoar said Evans never discussed details
of the case with him.</TE>
<TE>   Ordered to Stay Away</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination, Rundle confronted Shoar with a letter
from the Saks store in Costa Mesa ordering him to stay off the
property because of his disruptive behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Shoar, who worked at the Costa Mesa store until July, testified
that he has called several Saks executives complaining about a Saks
employee who Shoar said broke into his house and left a note for his
pregnant wife.</TE>
<TE>   He said that he has been worried about his wife's safety and that
he warned the executives of his plans to file a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle asked Shoar if he was angry with Saks Fifth Avenue. He said
no, prompting several people in the courtroom to laugh and the judge
to admonish them.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle accused Shoar of threatening to talk to Geragos if Saks did
not do what he wanted -- fire a Saks employee who had an affair with
his wife. Shoar denied that allegation. He also insisted that his
testimony about Evans' statements was true.</TE>
<TE>   Shoar said that when he went to see Geragos, he was looking for an
attorney in his own case. But he said Geragos told him that would be
a conflict of interest and referred him to a different attorney.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Friday, the investigating officer in Ryder's
case told jurors he did not book the four sensor tags into evidence
at the Beverly Hills Police Department. Instead, Det. George Elwell
said, he locked the tags in his desk drawer with the case file.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills Lt. Gary Gilmond told jurors he gave a news
conference saying that Ryder had been observed on store security
video cutting tags off merchandise. Gilmond said he based his news
conference on a statement by security guard Colleen Rainey, who said
she saw Ryder cut tags off merchandise. Gilmond said he later learned
that the video did not show tags being cut.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos also called district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons,
who testified that she wrote a news release with the same information
but said she later realized her mistake. "I certainly told everybody
who called about it that the error was mine," she told jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos has suggested during the trial that Saks employees changed
their stories after prosecutors realized that Ryder was not seen on
tape cutting tags.</TE>
<TE>   Transcript Released</TE>
<TE>   Judge Elden S. Fox also released a partial transcript Friday of
arguments on pretrial motions that took place last week. The
transcript was released as a result of an appellate court decision
that Fox had erred in closing the hearing without making adequate
legal findings.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing last week, Fox ruled that the district
attorney's office could not present as evidence a statement Ryder
signed in the Saks detention room that read: "I, Winona Ryder, agree
that I have stolen these items." The judge did, however, rule that
prosecutors could present several statements that Ryder made at Saks
after her detention that she took the items in preparation for a
future film role.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos had challenged the admission of the film statements,
arguing that she should have first been read her Miranda rights
against self-incrimination.</TE>

<HD>Mayor, Councilman Enter School Fray</HD>
<DH>Already hot Santa Ana campaign for board of education gets
more so with opposition to a site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana's mayor and a fellow City Council member have entered the
contentious school board campaign to promote two candidates they said
would work to stop a controversial school from being built in the
city's affluent north end.</LD>
<LD>   In a mailer sent this week to residents near the planned Lorin
Griset Elementary School, Mayor Miguel A. Pulido and Councilman Brett
Franklin urged people to vote for candidates Oscar Garza and Lupe
Moreno on Tuesday. They said a new school board majority could
"reverse the decision ... and allow homes to be built" instead.</LD>
<LD>   Garza and Moreno are among six challengers to seats now held by
Santa Ana Unified School District Trustees John Palacio and Nadia
Maria Davis, who are seeking second four-year terms.</LD>
<TE>   The race is part of an effort to wrest control from Palacio, Davis
and Trustee Nativo Lopez, who faces a recall election Feb. 4. Davis
is viewed as the ideological ally of Palacio and Lopez on the
five-member board. She has tried to distance herself from them in
recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Many blame the three for failings in the heavily Latino
62,000-student district, which despite improvements in recent years
still scores among the lowest in the state in standardized tests.</TE>
<TE>   Some also accuse Lopez of improperly promoting bilingual education
in the district, which he denies. Ron Unz, the businessman behind
Proposition 227, the successful 1998 measure curbing bilingual ed,
has donated to the Lopez recall drive. He also has given a total of
$18,000 to Moreno and Garza, wanting to unseat Lopez's allies.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and Palacio say their opponents are fueled more by their
objection to the new school, a source of friction between the current
school board majority and city officials.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the city approved a luxury home complex for the empty
nine-acre lot between Flower Street and the Santa Ana Freeway. The
severely crowded district, which is trying to find land to build new
schools, took the property by eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   Some who live nearby have complained that the new school would
serve mostly students from outside the neighborhood and disrupt their
quiet streets. Advocates of the school say there are very few empty
lots available in the city for school construction, and they accuse
the opposition of being motivated by class and ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue in this election is about whether or not to build a
school in the affluent north end of the city," Palacio said.</TE>
<TE>   Palacio has spent more than $25,000 on his campaign in the last
month alone, according to financial statements filed Friday with the
registrar of voters. That is more than any other candidate has
reported to date. Palacio also reported in-kind donations worth
$12,000.</TE>
<TE>   Palacio said Friday that he has no time to respond to the latest
mailer endorsed by the mayor and councilman Franklin. But he noted
that his district has already spent close to $2.5 million planning
the school.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin declined to comment in detail, saying the flier spoke for
itself. Pulido did not return calls requesting comment.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno said that, if elected Tuesday, she would vote to stop
construction of the school. "I want schools built where people want
them built and where the children are," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Garza promised only to reevaluate the school plan, saying,
"Nothing is certain."</TE>
<TE>   Some residents criticize the mailer, noting that city officials
have called the district slow to build schools under Measure C, a
$145-million bond measure passed in 1999.</TE>

<LD>Although the cause of August's fire at the Santana Row shopping
complex remains unknown, the state fire marshal has concluded that
the investigation was thorough.</LD>
<LD>   The report comes after questions were raised about why the Fire
Department spurned the assistance of highly trained federal fire
investigators even though local investigators were overwhelmed.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks after the fire, 15 police officers were added to the
inquiry to help interview more than 400 witnesses.</LD>
<TE>   The fire caused more than $70 million in damage and sparked other
blazes that burned 36 homes.</TE>

<HD>Holden Says Secession Would Help African Americans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Sue Fox</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the secession campaign entered its final weekend, backers of San
Fernando Valley and Hollywood cityhood on Friday landed their first
endorsement from a Los Angeles City Council member, while breakup
opponents picked up support from two big-name entertainment firms.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Nate Holden said he will vote for secession on
Tuesday's ballot and has recommended in a mailer to his South-Central
Los Angeles constituents that they do the same.</LD>
<LD>   "The African American community and the inner city have been
misled when they were told they would be a loser in secession,"
Holden said.</LD>
<TE>   He said a breakup would give African Americans a better chance of
winning more council seats in the remainder of Los Angeles and could
bring more federal dollars to the city because Los Angeles would then
have a higher percentage of impoverished areas qualifying for grants.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists said they were cheered by Holden's endorsement. Kam
Kuwata, who is running Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession campaign,
said Holden is out of step with the majority of African American
leaders, who oppose secession.</TE>
<TE>   The campaigns against secession have topped $7 million in
fund-raising with last-minute contributions including $11,000 from
Universal Studios and $10,000 from Disney Worldwide Services Inc. The
donations were disclosed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount Pictures Group and Sony Pictures previously contributed
$25,000 each to Hahn's effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been happy in the city of Los Angeles," said Universal
spokeswoman Iris Gelt. "Our contribution reflects that."</TE>
<TE>   However, Valley secession leader Carlos Ferreyra said big
companies feel obligated to contribute to the anti-secession campaign
because they do not want to alienate City Hall, even though, he said,
the city has done a poor job of keeping film production in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand how they can say Los Angeles has been good for
the film industry when we have runaway production," Ferreyra said.</TE>
<TE>   Friday began with a rally in Hollywood, where Councilmen Tom
LaBonge and Eric Garcetti and Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los
Angeles) urged residents to vote against secession.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as you don't edit or cut up a great film, L.A. is a great
city that I would not like to see cut up," LaBonge said.</TE>
<TE>   Gene La Pietra, chairman of the Hollywood Independence Committee,
said the poorly attended rally was a sign that Measure H, the
Hollywood secession proposal, will win. He said voters will hold city
officials responsible for Hollywood's blight.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is a terribly underutilized economic resource in
Southern California," La Pietra said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, secession supporters and opponents duked it out on a panel
at the Valley Industry &amp; Commerce Assn.'s annual conference in
Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "The uncertainty [secession] creates for business is not good at a
time when we're trying to bail ourselves out from a recession," said
Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce President Rusty Hammer, who
opposes a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   He said creating new cities would only create new bureaucracies
and reduce the region's political clout in Sacramento and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But former Assemblyman Richard Katz, a leading secessionist, said
a Valley city would deliver more local control and lower taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "I will forgive [Hammer] his optimism about the city of Los
Angeles' ability to reform itself, because he's only been here a
year," Katz said. "Those of us who have been here much longer ...
know that the city isn't capable of reforming itself."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the anti-secession group One Los Angeles called on
secessionists to agree to a four-year moratorium on future breakup
efforts if the measures lose Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "After the voters reject secession, it is time for the
secessionists to work with everyone to improve the entire city of Los
Angeles, including the San Fernando Valley," said Jeff Daar,
co-chairman of Encino-based One Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreyra did not object to such a moratorium, although he said he
could not speak for all secession backers.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, a poll released by KABC-TV indicated Valley secession
is widely opposed citywide but favored in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Survey USA poll, conducted by automated phone calls, found
that 38% of voters surveyed citywide favor Valley secession and 60%
oppose it. In the Valley, 55% support Valley cityhood and 42% do not.
The margin of error is plus or minus 4.3%. To win, secession must get
a majority of votes in the breakaway region and citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Some polling experts question the reliability of Survey USA's
findings because it does not use live interviewers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in response to accusations by the American Civil
Liberties Union that city officials violated the 1st Amendment rights
of secessionists by excluding them from an Oct. 5 event at the
Convention Center, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo sent a memo to all
city departments Friday asking them to provide equal access to both
sides for events on public property.</TE>

<HD>College Trustee Candidates Call for Change</HD>
<DH>The race for the district board in Ventura County is
colored by a financial scandal involving the former chancellor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accountability. Credibility. Honesty. That is the mantra of 13
candidates running for the Ventura County Community College District
Board of Trustees, including two incumbents fighting to keep their
seats.</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath of a spending scandal that forced former
Chancellor Philip Westin to resign last week, all the candidates
agree that change is needed to restore public confidence in the
34,000-student district and to ensure that such costly mistakes don't
happen again.</LD>
<LD>   Westin spent $119,000 in public money over four years on meals,
car repairs, computers and other electronics, and was accused of
mismanaging thousands more. An internal investigation showed that he
broke no rules or laws, but the results came too late to repair the
institution's battered reputation.</LD>
<TE>   The controversy catapulted normally low-visibility races onto
county taxpayers' radar. But voters have short memories, and Westin's
departure may mark the end of public interest in the board, said
Herbert Gooch, chairman of the political science department at Cal
Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be more significant if it had happened the
weekend before the election," Gooch said. "It's reminded people that
there's a problem out there, but now it looks like the problem is
solved."</TE>
<TE>   The winners of the three open seats will help select the next
chancellor, balance a shrinking budget and decide how to spend a
$356-million bond to improve the district's campuses in Ventura,
Oxnard and Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees Art Hernandez and John Tallman -- the only board members
to oppose Westin's settlement last week -- are up for reelection
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Three Challenge the</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent in Area 1</TE>
<TE>   Voters hungry for reform may not remember that Tallman warned the
board about Westin years ago, the trustee said.</TE>
<TE>   "People seem to want to paint us all with the same brush," said
Tallman, 71, of Ventura, who was first elected to the board in 1994.
The retired district vice chancellor of instruction was the only
trustee to vote against awarding a $30,000 raise to Westin in May,
two months after the board had asked him to resign for allegedly
abusing his expense account.</TE>
<TE>   But his challengers in Area 1, which covers parts of Oxnard,
Ventura and Port Hueneme, said it is time for a new perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Although he has a lot of knowledge about the inner workings of
the district, I think there's a rebuilding that's necessary that you
can only do with a fresh set of eyes and ears," said Mary Anne
Rooney, 41, of Oxnard, who teaches English to adults in the Oxnard
Union High School District.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Laird, 29, a Ventura accountant, said the Westin controversy
has kept the board from dealing with important issues, such as how to
spend the bond approved by voters in March and how to build a strong
relationship with the new Cal State Channel Islands campus.</TE>
<TE>   "I was concerned about the way the board was running its
operations, turning over its power to the chancellor and the abuses
that were happening," Laird said, explaining why he chose to run.</TE>
<TE>   David L. Norrdin, a movie theater attendant from Ventura, said he
wants "justice for taxpayers," particularly senior citizens on fixed
incomes. If elected, he wouldn't spend "one penny" on meals and
travel and he would work to rescind expense accounts for the
chancellor and trustees.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not congressmen," said Norrdin, 43. "They need to stay in
the district."</TE>
<TE>   Nagel Not Seeking Reelection in Area 2</TE>
<TE>   In Area 2, which covers Thousand Oaks, Oak Park and the Ventura
County portion of Westlake Village, five Thousand Oaks residents are
vying to replace trustee Norman Nagel, who decided not to seek
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll Bowen, 81, a retired professor of political science and
public administration at Cal Lutheran University and USC, said the
board needs someone with his background to help steer it onto the
right course.</TE>
<TE>   "The recent shortcomings which the district has experienced had a
bad combination of operating philosophies -- a hands-off board and an
executive who at best needed hands-on control," said Bowen, a
Thousand Oaks city councilman from 1970 to 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Heitmann, 56, a fund-raising consultant for nonprofit
agencies, said the board should create an independent auditing
committee to review programs and spending, and should take back the
authority it gave the chancellor for hiring and spending. She said
the board's decision on the bond money is crucial.</TE>
<TE>   "The board ultimately has the final say on how that bond is
spent," said Heitmann, who served on a bond oversight committee for
the Conejo Valley Unified School District. "It has to be spent wisely
and equitably among all three campuses. They all should share in
this. It's really crucial that it's used the way it was intended by
voters."</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Patrizio, 66, a retired Beverly Hills firefighter, said he
is most concerned about improving the district's vocational education
program and training young people for jobs with local businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my passion, that's what's motivated me," said Patrizio,
who was accused early in the race of trying to bribe another Area 2
candidate, Dan Peate, into dropping out. Patrizio denied it and
accused Peate of trying to grab headlines by making up the
allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Peate had been thinking about serving on the board for some time
and finally decided to take the plunge.</TE>
<TE>   "When everything came out, I was definitely concerned about the
fiscal responsibility of the board," said Peate, 24, an employee
benefits consultant for an insurance company. "That's when I decided
I would run."</TE>
<TE>   Homemaker Linda Van Dolsen, 56, said that many of the trustees'
problems stem from an inability to deal with the district's growth.
Instead of confronting the issues, the board simply turned over its
authority to Westin, who led by intimidation, she said. As a trustee,
she would take back the power and help create an open environment
among administrators, faculty and staff.</TE>
<TE>   "So much of running a district is having good employees who aren't
afraid to speak up when they see something wrong," Van Dolsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Vote Dogs Incumbent Hernandez in Area 5</TE>
<TE>   In Area 5, representing most of Oxnard, El Rio and Port Hueneme,
Hernandez has been dogged by his vote in May to extend Westin's
contract and give him a 16% raise -- to $203,000 a year -- although
trustees were aware of his spending habits.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, of Oxnard, now says he made a mistake because he
thought that supporting Westin would help secure money for Oxnard
College.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly would approach the same situation differently," said
Hernandez, 45, who was first elected to his seat midterm in 2000.
"When there were issues in getting equity for Oxnard College, I wish
I would have gone out into the community and brought people together,
so we could say, 'Hey, bring these things to our community.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ron Dyste, a political science instructor at Moorpark College,
said that if he is elected, he would ask the Ventura County Superior
Court to determine if Westin's original contract was approved in
violation of the state's open-meetings law, as some critics have
charged.</TE>
<TE>   "I would want to know if the contract is valid, then we could
adjust the settlement in some way," said Dyste, 57, a former vice
president at Ventura College.</TE>
<TE>   To ease the budget crisis, Dyste said, he would hire an
independent auditor to review the district's expenses; reduce legal
fees, which have climbed to nearly $1 million a year; cut the budget
reserve to free up about $2 million; and freeze administrative
salaries indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Deshay D. Ford, 54, an occupational therapist from Oxnard, wants
to reduce the number of administrators and lower the salaries of
those already working to free up money to hire more full-time
faculty.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Munoz Schnopp, 43, a Port Hueneme resident who owns a
marketing and public relations firm, said there should be more
collaboration between the colleges and area businesses to encourage
young people to attend the colleges, especially Oxnard College.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remember that if there weren't any students, we
wouldn't be in business," she said.</TE>

<HD>Secession Hotbed Offers 7 Council Hopefuls</HD>
<DH>Cityhood campaign's roots extend deep in the southeast
Valley's proposed 14th district.</DH>

<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The southeast San Fernando Valley is a hotbed of small-government
activism where the secession campaign has some of its deepest roots.
In Tuesday's election, seven true believers in breaking up Los
Angeles will compete for the 14th district seat on the proposed
Valley city council.</LD>
<LD>   Expanding the police force and cutting business taxes are among
the candidates' priorities. They also want to give more power to
neighborhood councils and extend the Red Line subway to the West
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   If secession passes, the winner of the 14th district race will
represent upscale sections of Studio City, east Sherman Oaks and
Toluca Lake as well as middle- and working-class areas of North
Hollywood and Van Nuys.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an opportunity for citizens to step up to the plate and
be heard," said candidate Stefanie Spikell, a Studio City
businesswoman. "One of the reasons the Valley is trying to leave is
to get some local control over our money and our destiny."</TE>
<TE>   The other candidates are manufacturing director John Ferrero III,
businessman Jerry Hays, marketing executive Laronce M. Henderson,
actor Randall R. Read, tax attorney Gary M. Slavett and legislative
deputy Scott Svonkin.</TE>
<TE>   Svonkin, the former chief of staff for Assemblyman Paul Koretz
(D-West Hollywood), has the longest list of endorsements and biggest
financial backers, having raised $96,000 as of the latest reporting
period.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters include the county and state Democratic Party,
Koretz, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) and Richard Close, who is
chairman of both the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. and secession
group Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   Hays, a painting contractor, is a distant second in fund-raising
with $9,500.</TE>
<TE>   Svonkin's lead in fund-raising has made him a lightning rod for
criticism by other candidates who question his ties to the community.
He moved to Sherman Oaks from elsewhere in the Valley a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He has not been visible in the community at all," Spikell said.</TE>
<TE>   Svonkin, 36, said he has lived in the Valley for more than a
decade and moved to Sherman Oaks so he would be in the legislative
district of his boss, Koretz.</TE>
<TE>   Having also worked in the administration of Mayor Tom Bradley and
for Prudential HealthCare, Svonkin said he is uniquely qualified
among the candidates. "I'm the only candidate with both government
and business experience," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He calls for doubling the number of police officers patrolling the
Valley -- now 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   "My No. 1 priority is to put more police in the neighborhoods and
in the parks," Svonkin said.</TE>
<TE>   He also proposes eliminating the business license tax, enlisting
corporations to maintain parks in exchange for naming rights,
preserving the Studio City Golf and Tennis Center, and building
light-rail lines along the San Diego and Ventura freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Hays, 65, also brings some leadership experience to the race.</TE>
<TE>   The Studio City resident has been president of both the Studio
City Chamber of Commerce and the United Chambers of Commerce of the
San Fernando Valley. He ran unsuccessfully for a Los Angeles City
Council seat in 1983 and 1987.</TE>
<TE>   His first concern is public safety, and he supports contracting
with the Los Angeles Police Department until the Valley can form its
own police force of 4,000 officers.</TE>
<TE>   He said a Valley city could hire more officers by cutting costs
elsewhere, and charging other cities to use its police training
academy. It could also, he said, do a better job of getting state and
federal grants than Los Angeles does.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles has been terrible working with the state and federal
government to get financial support," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hays said he would cut the Valley business taxes after studying
how much they should be reduced. Hays said he also would support
building light rail in the center of the Ventura Freeway, and would
have a Valley city quickly apply to the state for its own school
district.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero, 42 (no relation to former Councilman John Ferraro), is an
eight-year resident of Studio City and works as a production manager
for an aerospace manufacturer. He says he has become an efficiency
expert.</TE>
<TE>   He opposes rezoning the Studio City Golf and Tennis Center for
housing, saying, "It's an issue of preserving open space."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero would strengthen Los Angeles' advisory neighborhood
councils, giving them a role in local planning decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "My top priority is to give a measure of control to the community,
to make neighborhood councils more a part of the process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero said he backs contracting with the LAPD until the Valley
can form its own force of 4,000 to 5,000 officers. He supports
creating a Valley school district and building a monorail on the
Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Spikell is on the formation team for the Studio City neighborhood
council, serves on the board of the Studio City Chamber of Commerce
and recently helped the Studio City Residents Assn. plant 100 trees
in the area.</TE>
<TE>   She says the Valley should eventually have its own 3,000- to
4,000-officer police department. She also wants the Valley to launch
its own transit district, and would like to see the subway extended
in the Valley in the long term. In the meantime, she would support
more high-speed bus or light-rail systems.</TE>
<TE>   Spikell, 57, opposes a plan to double-deck the Ventura Freeway to
add traffic lanes because of noise concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Randall R. Read, 68, has lived in Studio City since 1990. A former
broadcaster, Read has worked the last 12 years as a character actor
in films, including "Armageddon" and "Pearl Harbor."</TE>
<TE>   He envisions a Valley police force of at least 2,500 officers and
would target hardened criminals. "I would like to eradicate the gangs
in the Valley," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Read, who served briefly many years ago as a city councilman in
Shell Lake, Wis., supports plans for a dedicated busway along
Chandler Avenue and would oppose reinstating the documentary transfer
tax, which generates $30 million annually but would lapse if the
Valley became a separate city.</TE>
<TE>   Slavett, 32, of Sherman Oaks, said he would cut the city's gross
receipts tax. "The city of Los Angeles has a hard time keeping
business in its borders because of that tax," said Slavett, a tax
attorney. He also would seek to ease traffic congestion by extending
the Red Line subway underground to Woodland Hills and by
synchronizing stop lights.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson failed to return numerous phone calls seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>Arab World Sees a Resurgence of Islamic Politics</HD>
<DH>Religion is becoming the leading force in the region,
observers say. In several countries, national debate revolves around
Muslim identity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Gripped by frustration and a sense of powerlessness, particularly in
the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, multitudes of Arabs
are embracing a more conservative interpretation of Islam to define
their identity and reclaim some faith in the future.</LD>
<LD>   The growing influence of Islamism, Arab scholars and Western
analysts generally agree, has turned religion into the leading
political force in the region. It is, they say, the most significant
political movement since Pan-Arabism, preached by Egyptian President
Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1950s and '60s, and a source of concern to
Arab regimes that allow little democracy or freedom of expression.</LD>
<LD>   In Morocco's September election, a moderate Islamist party was the
third-largest vote-getter.</LD>
<TE>   In Egypt, Islamists, who by government order had to run as
independents, won at least one-quarter of the National Assembly seats
in 2000. Preachers such as Amr Khaled in Cairo have been elevated to
celebrity status with sermons that are conservative but not
inflammatory. And across much of the Arab world, women of all classes
are putting on the hijab, the head scarf their grandmothers fought to
take off half a century ago as a symbol of women's oppression.</TE>
<TE>   "My neighbor had been going to religion classes for several years
and tried to convince me to go, but I wasn't ready," said Omniya
Mahmoud, 27, a Cairo teacher. "I used to be the type who really took
care of what I wore, dyed my hair, put on makeup. But when I started
the classes, I found lots of other women my age. I realized this was
the right thing to do. It is what God wants.</TE>
<TE>   "I veiled about a year ago," she said. "Being veiled doesn't mean
I'm a fanatic, despite what they think abroad. It just means I'm
doing what God wants me to do as a good Muslim."</TE>
<TE>   In Cairo's sidewalk coffee shops, where men sip coffee and puff on
water pipes, the topic that is endlessly debated is not Arab unity,
Iraq or the fate of the Palestinians. It is what actions and beliefs
fit into an Islamic context. Saudi Arabia and Iran also are debating
the meaning of being Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars are divided over whether this searching represents reform
or is a discussion somehow manipulated by regimes sensitive to
Islam's image and Western misperceptions that Islam condones violence
and condemns modernity.</TE>
<TE>   "The moderate Muslim is looking for a Muslim ideology he can
identify with, one that doesn't put him on a collision course with
world powers and doesn't lead to catastrophic killings or psychotic
acts like we've seen," said Frank Vogel, an Islamic scholar at
Harvard University. "What he doesn't want is some kind of new Western
or global order imposed on him willy-nilly that has nothing to do
with his Islamic identity or authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   "But 'moderate Muslim' doesn't mean what many people think. A
mainstream Muslim often does believe in things like religion having a
role in politics and in state law. At first blush those beliefs seem
fundamentalist. But if we mistranslate them as extremist, we'll
misjudge what's going on in the Middle East and we'll fail to play a
positive role in the emergence there of moderate and successful
political systems."</TE>
<TE>   The roots of Islamic revival go back to 1967, when Arabs believed
that their defeat in the Six-Day War against Israel was an expression
of God's anger for drifting too far from their religion. The mosques
started filling and the veils reappearing.</TE>
<TE>   Many attribute the latest wave of Islamism, at least in part, to
signals and language emanating from the United States: the Bush
administration's disengagement from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
the war in Afghanistan and the possibility of another in Iraq,
President Bush's remark in April that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was
"a man of peace" as Israel was reoccupying the West Bank, and the
Rev. Jerry Falwell's comment that the prophet Muhammad was "a
terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing now isn't about Islam; it's about frustration
and finding an identity for yourself," said Manal Kahmhawy, a
54-year-old homemaker. "I think also that since Sept. 11 more people
are considering themselves Muslims because Islam is threatened now.
It's an enemy of the West, so people cling to it. It's a matter of
pride, not religion. We're on the defensive."</TE>
<TE>   The frustrations are understandable, given the fact that Arabs
were once on the cutting edge of progress and knowledge. Fifteen
centuries ago, while Attila the Hun was raiding Gaul and Italy, Arab
tribes were gathering annually for weeklong poetry festivals. Arabs
believed that the world was round when Europeans thought that it was
flat. Arabs devised algebra, invented the universal astrolabe --
forerunner of the sextant -- and discovered and named chemical
substances such as alkaline.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after the birth of Islam in the 7th century, the great Arab
cities -- Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad and Cordoba in Spain -- were the
intellectual centers of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptians recorded their history in a written language while
nomadic tribes were still roaming Europe and sleeping in mud huts.
Egyptians invented surveying, produced the first paper, made the
first beer from grain (which they put in glass jars sealed with mud
tops), developed astrology and established the 365-day calendar, with
each day divided into 24 hours. Men shaved, cut their hair, wore
wigs. Women used perfume and cosmetics.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a feeling today we didn't really participate in the
postindustrial era, that we haven't achieved anything to add to the
modern progress of the world," said Hala Mustafa, an Egyptian social
and political commentator. "This lack of accomplishment creates a gap
between the Arab and Western worlds."</TE>
<TE>   A United Nations report, prepared by Arab scholars and published
this year, offers confirmation of social and economic stagnation in
the 22 members of the Arab League. Their access to the Internet and
use of computers are lower than that in sub-Saharan Africa. Their
1999 gross domestic product of $531 billion was less than that of
Spain. Their 15% unemployment is among the highest in the developing
world. About 10 million children between the ages of 6 and 15 don't
go to school. Half of the women are illiterate. One out of every five
people in the Arab world lives on less than $2 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Just as disturbing, the wave of democracy that swept over Latin
America, Asia, Eastern Europe and parts of Africa in the 1980s and
'90s hardly touched the lives of the 280 million Arabs. Using
indicators such as the political process, civil liberties, political
rights and independence of the media, the U.N.'s Arab Human
Development Report 2002 said the Arab world has the lowest "freedom
score" of the globe's seven regions.</TE>
<TE>   "When so much has failed, it's natural for people to say: 'Let's
try Islam. Maybe that will give us some of the happiness the world
holds,' " said Ali Darwish, an Egyptian poet.</TE>
<TE>   There is no word in classical Arabic for fundamentalism, so
linguists have had to invent one: usuliyya, which translates roughly
as "basic principles."</TE>
<TE>   If the debate over Islam in the cafes of Cairo and other places
indeed represents a reform movement, it is not clear what triumphs:
tradition or modernity, extremism or tolerance, secularism or
sectarianism.</TE>
<TE>   The answer, many believe, depends on whether regimes are willing
to give people more civil liberties and open the safety valve of free
expression in a region where democracy has never been part of culture
and collectivism has always been valued more than individualism.</TE>
<TE>   "All regimes in the region became concerned with the implications
of a lack of social and economic development after 9/11," said Hafez
abu Saada, secretary-general of the Egyptian Human Rights
Organization. "It's late in the game, but their future, and Egypt's,
depends on taking steps toward democracy. The alternative is chaos or
Islamism."</TE>

<HD>Queen Recalls: The Butler Didn't Do It</HD>
<DH>Elizabeth's belated recollection of a 5-year-old
conversation clears a former servant on trial for stealing from
Princess Diana's estate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>It was a royal case of recovered memory.</LD>
<LD>   Queen Elizabeth II's late-in-the-game recollection Friday of an
old conversation cleared a former butler accused of stealing
possessions from the estate of Princess Diana, ending a trial that
had stirred the ghosts of past royal scandals and threatened even
greater tabloid mayhem ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Crown prosecutors abandoned their case against the late princess'
longtime butler, Paul Burrell, 44, after the queen confirmed that
Burrell had told her that he had taken some of Diana's papers for
"safekeeping" after her 1997 death.</LD>
<TE>   The crown's case had been based on the sinister premise that
Burrell had absconded from Diana's Kensington Palace home with 310
items -- from CDs to designer clothes to intimate letters -- without
telling anyone.</TE>
<TE>   It now turns out that he had informed not just someone, but
Diana's mother-in-law: the queen in whose name the prosecution was
formally waged.</TE>
<TE>   The butler-turned-small-town-florist, whom Diana once famously
referred to as her "rock," wept in the courtroom of London's Old
Bailey when it became apparent that the prosecution's case had
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "The queen has come through for me," he said as he emerged into
the flash of cameras outside. Burrell's first job in royal service
was as a footman to Elizabeth.</TE>
<TE>   But his acquittal, which will be rubber-stamped by the jury next
week, raised hard questions about why the charges ever reached court.</TE>
<TE>   And the widely held view of a dismal prosecution case -- plus the
prospect of even more embarrassing royal revelations -- has nurtured
suspicions about the timing of the queen's realization that she
possessed crucial information.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it's very rum, very odd indeed," said Sarah Bradford, a
respected biographer of British royalty, including the queen.</TE>
<TE>   The butler had worked for Diana in the turbulent last 10 years of
her life, and the possibility of a grotesque replay in court of some
of those darker moments led to a widespread assumption that the royal
family was eager to find any excuse necessary to stop the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been a disaster for them," said designer and
leading British socialite Nicky Haslam.</TE>
<TE>   The Buckingham Palace version of events is that the queen had been
unaware of the trial's details because she was on a royal tour of
Canada when it began. Her memory wasn't jogged until a week ago, when
she, her husband, Prince Philip, and her son, Prince Charles, were
being driven to London's St. Paul's Cathedral to attend a memorial
service for British victims of last month's bombing of two nightclubs
in Bali, Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of what the palace described as a "general
conversation," the queen mentioned that Burrell had told her back in
1997 that he was holding some of Diana's items for safekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   Charles, Diana's ex-husband, swiftly recognized the potential
legal importance of this, the palace said, and "immediate steps were
taken to draw this to the attention of the police."</TE>
<TE>   Yet several people came forward Friday to say they had long been
aware of the meeting between Burrell and the queen. Diana's close
friend Rosa Monckton recalled Burrell telling her at the time: "I've
just had a meeting with the Boss Lady," which is how he referred to
the queen in casual conversation.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting -- but none of its details -- also was mentioned in
Burrell's original 39-page statement given to police in August 2001.
And it was cited again in his defense statement, the detailed outline
of the defense's case that, by law, was given to the prosecution
before the trial began.</TE>
<TE>   Both police and prosecutors said they never sought an explanation
from Burrell or the queen about what had been said between them.</TE>
<TE>   Burrell's lawyers said their client hadn't told them until this
week that the queen was aware he was holding Diana's things. They
implied that his discretion was a measure of his loyalty to the royal
family, a cornerstone of his defense. Burrell has always contended
that he was merely preserving the items out of devotion to Diana and
her memory.</TE>
<TE>   But the crown tried to show that Burrell was not as close to the
princess as he claimed. That was just one of what Burrell's lawyer
Andrew Shaw said were "numerous errors" on which the prosecution
based its case.</TE>
<TE>   Over 12 days of testimony, the court heard many examples of what
appeared to be sloppy and overzealous police work.</TE>
<TE>   Under oath, detectives admitted that they had secured support from
Prince Charles and his son Prince William for their prosecution by
telling them that Burrell had sold stolen "Dianabilia" to foreign
collectors. They also said they would produce photos in court showing
Burrell and some of the princess' former staff members at a party
dressed in some of her designer clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Neither suggestion was true, police acknowledged under
questioning. Worse, Det. Maxine de Brunner said she allowed Charles
and William to "remain under that misconception."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, defense lawyers were coaxing unsettling gossip -- of
dubious legal value -- from prosecution witnesses, including Diana's
mother and two sisters.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures were messy: Diana and her mother had not spoken in
the four months before her death; her brother, Charles Spencer, had
refused to let her rent a house on the family estate because it would
disturb his family's life; and the princess had kept a signet ring
belonging to James Hewitt, with whom she had had an affair while
married to Prince Charles.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the defense rebuttal, which Burrell's lawyers
promised would be "long, detailed and extremely interesting," had not
even begun.</TE>
<TE>   That led many to believe that the fix was in.</TE>
<TE>   "But it shows the British establishment is alive and well," Haslam
said.</TE>

<HD>Sharon Proffers a Post to a Rival</HD>
<DH>Israeli premier asks predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu to
become foreign minister.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, moving to fill a key post in his
new government, met Friday with longtime rival Benjamin Netanyahu and
reportedly offered him the job of foreign minister.</LD>
<LD>   The prime minister summoned Netanyahu to his sheep ranch in the
Negev desert for several hours of talks that ended as the Jewish
Sabbath was beginning. The two men were to meet again Sunday, when
the Israeli workweek commences. Israeli media said Netanyahu had
asked for time to think about Sharon's offer.</LD>
<LD>   After 20 months, the conservative Sharon's political partnership
with the left-leaning Labor Party collapsed Wednesday, forcing him to
scramble to fill important Cabinet posts and find new parliamentary
allies.</LD>
<TE>   His aides were said to be making overtures to far-right and
religious parties to secure the half-dozen seats he needs to again
secure a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. Sharon said the
government's major policies will not change as a result of his new
coalition, although most of his potential partners oppose peace
overtures toward the Palestinians and advocate the expansion of
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu and Sharon, both stalwarts of the conservative Likud
Party, have a complicated personal and political history, during
which each has often seized on the opportunity to publicly humiliate
the other.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon served as foreign minister during Netanyahu's 1996-99
tenure as prime minister. During that time, Netanyahu kept Sharon on
a short leash, reining him in sharply when he spoke out on policy
issues.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Netanyahu dealt Sharon a major political defeat when, at a
party convention, he pushed through a resolution ruling out the
establishment of a Palestinian state, over Sharon's objections.</TE>
<TE>   On that occasion, the two sat side by side without speaking. A
commentary in the Israeli daily Haaretz likened the feuding between
two such strong-willed figures to the "eruption of a terrifying
volcano."</TE>
<TE>   For Sharon, bringing Netanyahu into his government would help
neutralize his principal rival for the Likud leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The 53-year-old Netanyahu, universally known in Israel as "Bibi,"
had indicated that he intended to mount a primary challenge to Sharon
in advance of national elections. If he was a member of Sharon's
government, such a challenge would be far more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The Foreign Ministry is perhaps the most tempting post Sharon
could offer Netanyahu, because it would be a forum from which the
articulate, U.S.-educated former prime minister could serve as a
highly visible advocate of Israeli policy. The foreign minister's job
is being vacated by Shimon Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize winner.</TE>
<TE>   The shape of Sharon's new Cabinet was expected to become clearer
in coming days.</TE>
<TE>   He has already offered the Defense Ministry, a key portfolio
during this time of bitter conflict with the Palestinians, to Shaul
Mofaz, until recently the army chief of staff and the architect of
harsh Israeli military measures in the West Bank and Gaza. The
outgoing defense minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, led the Labor
walkout from Sharon's coalition.</TE>

<HD>Generals Guilty in Mexico Drug Case</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>A military court Friday convicted two generals of aiding drug
smugglers, concluding a high-profile case aimed at cracking down on
Mexico's drug trade.</LD>
<LD>   The five-general panel convicted Gen. Francisco Quiros and Brig.
Gen. Arturo Acosta of protecting cocaine and marijuana shipments for
drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who died in 1997 after undergoing
plastic surgery.</LD>
<LD>   It sentenced Quiros to 16 years in prison and Acosta to 15. They
have already served two years. The court cleared the men of another
charge of criminal association.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors accused the generals of protecting drug smugglers and
using military airplanes to transport shipments of cocaine and
marijuana. Quiros was also found guilty of taking bribes from
Carrillo Fuentes, who was Mexico's most-wanted drug trafficker in the
mid-1990s. The panel ordered two cars and other goods confiscated.</TE>
<TE>   The men were stripped of their ranks and their military
decorations.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the two said they would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The officers also face separate charges in the deaths of 130
leftist activists in the 1970s.</TE>

<HD>In Event of War, Patriots Won't Be on Front Line</HD>
<DH>The Pentagon considers the antimissile system so unreliable
that it plans to try taking out Iraq's Scud launchers before they can
be used.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A decade after its fiery combat debut in the Persian Gulf War, the
capabilities of the Patriot antimissile system remain so uncertain
that it will play only a secondary role if the United States again
goes to war with Iraq, say U.S. officials and analysts.</LD>
<LD>   The Patriot, the Pentagon's most advanced antimissile system, is
already deployed in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Israel to help
defend against Iraq's inventory of two dozen to four dozen Scud
missiles.</LD>
<LD>   Yet despite an intensive development effort since 1991, the
Patriot's ability to destroy all its targets is considered so
unreliable that Pentagon planners are focusing their antimissile
efforts on how best to find and destroy Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's mobile Scud launchers before the missiles are fired,
according to U.S. and private analysts.</LD>
<TE>   The missile defense mission is a top priority in war planning
because Hussein is expected to try to bombard U.S. troops, Israelis
or other allies with Scuds tipped with chemical or biological
warheads if attacked. In the Gulf War, the most damaging attack on
U.S. forces was a conventional Scud strike that hit an American
barracks in Saudi Arabia, killing 28 soldiers and injuring 99.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Scuds also hit Israel, but the U.S. applied diplomatic
pressure and used financial inducements to keep the Jewish state from
responding. This time, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has warned the
Bush administration that Israel will strike back if Scuds cause
civilian casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Fearful that an Israeli response would inflame the Arab world, the
U.S. has made eliminating Scuds a priority.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials say they are confident that the Patriot will
eventually work reliably. But they acknowledge that the model now in
the field, the Patriot Advance Capability-2, has limitations. A more
advanced version, the Patriot Advanced Capability-3, or PAC-3,
continues to struggle through development.</TE>
<TE>   The PAC-3 ran into unexpected problems during a round of testing
this year. Fewer than half the tests were successful, prompting Army
officials to put off full-scale production for at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Some private defense experts question whether even the PAC-3 could
take out Scuds in battle conditions, noting that the Iraqi missiles
fly an unpredictable path that makes it hard for Patriots to hit
them.</TE>
<TE>   And some contend that the Patriot may be ineffective against newer
short-range Iraqi missiles, which could be launched in volleys that
they say could overwhelm the Patriot system.</TE>
<TE>   Patriots rely on sophisticated radar and computers to identify
threatening missiles or aircraft when they come within range. The
system automatically fires interceptor missiles that travel at 4,000
feet per second and destroy the enemy missiles as they arc down
toward Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the military now views the Patriot as the answer to the
Iraqi missile threat, defense officials express confidence in the
technology but stop short of promising that it can be relied on to
knock down a high percentage of Scuds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tested pretty rigorously, we've been at it a long time,
and we're ready to declare it's a useful military system," Air Force
Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, head of the Missile Defense Agency, said
Thursday at a meeting with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   During the Gulf War, the weapon at first appeared to be highly
successful as a "Scud buster." Then-President Bush declared that in
42 attempts, Patriots had destroyed 41 Scuds.</TE>
<TE>   But soon it became clear that the Patriot interceptors were often
striking only metal debris from disintegrating Scuds, not touching
their warheads. After the war, a congressional study found that the
Patriots had been effective against only four Scuds; one Israeli
study contended the number was zero.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to give the Patriot a limited role in any new campaign
against Iraq come as a disappointment to missile defense advocates
who have embraced it as proof that this complex, expensive technology
can work.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the program point to the problems as evidence of the
immense challenges the Bush administration faces in building the much
larger and more elaborate long-range missile defense system that is
its ultimate goal.</TE>
<TE>   James M. Lindsay, a former National Security Council aide who
advocates a limited national missile defense, said the Patriot "is
going to play only a supporting role.... The military is hopeful for
what Patriot could do, but they clearly don't intend to rely on it
solely."</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay, now a Brookings Institution scholar, said this means
missile defense advocates must confront the core questions of the
missile defense program, "which has been long on promises and short
on products."</TE>
<TE>   There is also skepticism about the Patriot from America's closest
military ally in the region, Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has deployed Patriot missile batteries since the Gulf War.
But it has also built its own missile defense system, the Arrow. The
Israelis say the Arrow -- half the costs of which have been paid by
the United States -- will eventually be able to protect the entire
country.</TE>
<TE>   The Arrow is different from the Patriot in several respects. To
begin with, it fires missiles that seek to blow up enemy warheads at
a higher altitude, thus enabling it to protect a larger area.</TE>
<TE>   And by blowing up warheads higher above Earth, these missiles are
better able to disperse chemical agents and expose any biological
agents to sunlight, which can destroy them.</TE>
<TE>   By deploying both the Arrow and the Patriot, the Israelis have two
shots at eliminating enemy missiles, an arrangement known as a
layered defense.</TE>
<TE>   Even with two systems, the Israelis remain determined to try to
destroy Iraq's mobile Scud launchers in western Iraq before they can
fire rockets. The Israeli government has been pressing the Bush
administration to pledge that U.S. forces will complete that job at
the opening of any campaign against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Already, news reports from the region say U.S. or Israeli special
forces have been active in western Iraq looking for Scud launchers
and the weapons stores that Hussein is believed to have hidden there.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriot has a long history, involving cost overruns and
delays, periods of progress and unexpected reversals of fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Begun as an antiaircraft weapon in 1965, the Patriot was forced to
take on the much tougher job of destroying Scuds during the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Patriot system has a more fine-grained radar than the
one now in the field. It enables operators to distinguish enemy
warheads from other flying objects. The missile is more maneuverable
and better able to destroy warheads because it collides with them at
high speed, rather than setting off an explosion in the air close by.</TE>
<TE>   In tests conducted by its builder, Lockheed Martin, the new
Patriot performed well, hitting its target in 11 of 12 tries.
Advocates say this is proof the program can work.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only can you hit a bullet with a bullet -- you have been
doing it repeatedly. For some reason, that hasn't seeped into the
talk shows and media debates," Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine),
chairman of the House Armed Services research and development
subcommittee, declared in a hearing with Pentagon missile defense
officials last year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the results were not as good when the new Patriot was tested
by the Army this year under conditions more demanding and closer to
those the Patriot would confront in combat.</TE>
<TE>   In some tests, the interceptor missiles failed to strike their
targets; in some cases, they didn't even leave the launchers. There
were electrical problems and software glitches, and in one case the
missile nicked its target but didn't destroy it.</TE>
<TE>   Philip E. Coyle, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester from 1994
until 2001, said that based on those tests, the Patriot could be
expected to bring down less than 50% of incoming Scuds.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Kadish, the missile defense boss, said he was "disappointed"
in the test failures, but he insisted that they did not reflect a
weakness in design.</TE>
<TE>   Some defense experts believe that additional problems with the new
Patriot will emerge if it has real-life confrontations with Scuds.</TE>
<TE>   Scuds, which were built on the crude design of Germany's  World
War II rockets, are not engineered with precision and can wobble or
corkscrew in flight.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts contend that the Patriot is unprepared for such
challenges because, with the exception of two 1997 flights, there has
been little testing of Patriots against Scuds.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Senate included language in the defense
authorization bill requiring the Pentagon to test the Patriot against
Scuds.</TE>
<TE>   Defense experts say it makes sense for Pentagon war planners to
place their greatest emphasis on destroying Scud launchers rather
than relying on the new missile-defense hardware.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay, of Brookings, says this is true because of growing
confidence in Special Forces' ability to locate and destroy
launchers. Although U.S. forces failed badly at this task in the Gulf
War, since then there have been marked improvements in the military's
imaging and surveillance technologies and in its ability to quickly
reach and destroy such targets.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has announced plans to send the 40 advanced PAC-3
missiles that have been built so far to the Gulf, even though the new
system is still being tested. And Kadish has suggested that the
production rate of two a month be stepped up.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, former weapons tester Coyle says he believes the PAC-3
"won't be [present] in very large numbers. And they won't be able to
rely on them."</TE>

<HD>N. Korean Admission Doesn't Stall Nuclear Talks</HD>
<DH>Joint energy project continues as planned, despite
Pyongyang's violation of arms pact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>SEOUL -- This week, a North Korean team jetted to New York for three
days of meetings in a Park Avenue high-rise on insurance and
liability for a nuclear power system in North Korea. A week earlier,
another delegation had traveled from Seoul to Pyongyang in the North
to hash out the logistics of a satellite telephone system for the
$4.6-billion project.</LD>
<LD>   Given that the Bush administration has practically declared the
nuclear project dead, it would seem like rearranging deck chairs on
the Titanic.</LD>
<LD>   But the international consortium in charge of the power system has
hardly missed a beat since the White House announced last month that
North Korea had nullified a 1994 accord under which it promised to
give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for help with its
dire energy shortage. The deal calls for the building of two
light-water nuclear reactors.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, I'm still here," said Chang Sun Sup, the South Korean
representative to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization, or KEDO, as the consortium is known. "Generally
speaking, everybody is saying that the agreement is nullified. But
until it is officially pronounced dead, we are alive and breathing."</TE>
<TE>   "We are working until we are told otherwise," said another KEDO
official, who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea, which only a few weeks ago looked as if it might be
emerging from 50 years of isolation, reverted to its status of an
international pariah when it admitted it had violated the 1994
agreement and, furthermore, felt it had every right to develop a
nuclear bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The admission came during a meeting last month in Pyongyang, the
North's capital, with U.S. envoy James A. Kelly and has been followed
by a series of increasingly belligerent pronouncements. In talks this
week, the North Koreans refused to even discuss the nuclear issue
with Japan, shutting the door on what had appeared to be promising
normalization talks between the two nations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the soaring tensions, a large delegation of North Korean
scientists is due to arrive in Seoul in a few weeks for on-the-job
training in South Korean nuclear power plants.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a certain surreality to this," said Peter Hayes, head of
the Nautilus Institute in Berkeley, which studies nuclear issues
involving North Korea. "But even if you are a conservative, you don't
necessarily want to rupture relations with North Korea. Everybody is
just holding their breath because the situation is so volatile."</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 agreement grew out of another nuclear crisis that brought
the United States and North Korea uncomfortably close to war. At the
time, the Clinton administration believed that North Korea had
removed fuel rods from a nuclear power plant to use for a nuclear
bomb. The accord required North Korea to freeze and dismantle its
graphite-moderated nuclear reactors in exchange for two light-water
nuclear reactors -- which cannot be easily converted to military use.</TE>
<TE>   The three main partners in KEDO -- the United States, Japan and
South Korea -- all agree that they need to exert pressure on North
Korea to abandon its ambition to become a nuclear power. But just how
much pressure and how to apply it are matters of dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The White House wants to see North Korea disarm before any talking
begins. But South Korea, the country potentially most threatened by
North Korea's nuclear program and the largest contributor to the KEDO
project, wants to gently nudge the North into compliance.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean President Kim Dae Jung won a Nobel Peace Prize for
his policy of engagement with North Korea and does not, in the last
months of his term, want to abruptly reverse course.</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, one would hardly perceive that the Korean peninsula is
in the throes of what has been widely touted as a nuclear crisis.
Just as planning for the light-water reactors has continued without
pause, so have the North-South exchanges that have been a hallmark of
Kim's "sunshine policy."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to exert pressure by suspending North-South
exchanges or instituting economic sanctions," Jeong Se Hyun, South
Korea's unification minister, said in a lecture Wednesday at Korea
University in Seoul. Noting that North Korea needs outside assistance
simply to feed its people, he added, "They are not in a position to
pursue brinkmanship, so the chances are very high to solve the
nuclear issue through persuasion."</TE>
<TE>   A North Korean economic delegation, which includes a
brother-in-law of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, has spent the past
week touring the capitalist splendors of South Korea -- an amusement
park, an auto assembly plant and a container port were on the
itinerary -- andmaking politely enthusiastic comments at every stop.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad I have only two eyes. I'd like to see more," one
delegate was quoted as saying after touring the sprawling markets of
Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Another round of talks opened Friday on plans to build a reunion
center for families estranged since the 1950-53 Korean War. Also
Friday, the Koreas announced that for the first time since the war,
they will conduct a joint survey on flooding of the Imjin River,
which runs along the demilitarized zone between the countries.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of South Koreans bristled at President Bush's inclusion
this year of North Korea as part of an "axis of evil." Now some also
question whether a hawkish White House isn't again being unduly
harsh.</TE>
<TE>   The unification minister, among others, has questioned what
exactly was said at the Pyongyang meeting at which Kelly confronted
the North Koreans with evidence of the uranium-enrichment project and
reportedly received an unapologetic admission and a declaration the
1994 deal was dead.</TE>
<TE>   Under one line of reasoning now popular in Seoul, the North

<HD>Italian Quake Toll Hits 29; Probe Ordered</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SAN GIULIANO DI PUGLIA, Italy</DL>
<LD>Grieving families, fearful of further tremors, spent Friday night in
a makeshift tent camp in this Italian farming town, where 26 children
were killed by an earthquake that destroyed their school.</LD>
<LD>   As anger mounted across Italy over the disaster, the government
ordered an inquiry into why the school's roof fell on students
attending a Halloween party Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A teacher also died at the school, and two elderly women were
crushed to death elsewhere in the town of about 1,200. At least 3,000
people were left homeless in the southern Molise region by the
magnitude 5.4 earthquake and a strong aftershock Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Aerial shots of the medieval town showed that many buildings in
the center, some hundreds of years old, were damaged. But only the
school was reduced to a heap of concrete.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the houses in the town remained standing except for a few
cracks; the only building destroyed was the school," Infrastructure
Minister Pietro Lunardi told RAI television. "For this reason I have
named an inquiry commission."</TE>
<TE>   About 60 children were at the Francesco Iovine School -- built in
the early 1950s before Italy tightened seismic regulations -- when
disaster hit.</TE>
<TE>   An entire class of 6-year-olds was wiped out when the school
folded like a house of cards when the temblor struck.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said the school was not built to withstand the weight
of the concrete in the roof and in the walls of new classrooms added
to the second story.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers were pulling the last bodies from the rubble when a
powerful aftershock shook the village Friday afternoon, sparking
widespread panic and prompting police to evacuate residents.</TE>

<HD>Russian Lawmakers OK Media Limits</HD>
<DH>Amendments approved in the lower house would restrict
coverage of terrorism. Critics decry the drafts as a step toward
censorship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Less than a week after the takeover of a theater by Chechen rebels
led to the death of 119 hostages, Russia's lower house of parliament
Friday approved amendments limiting media coverage of terrorism that
were decried by some journalists and human rights groups as a step
toward censorship.</LD>
<LD>   The lower house, or State Duma, which is controlled by forces
loyal to President Vladimir V. Putin, also amended the law on
terrorism so that authorities are no longer required to return the
bodies of slain attackers to their families or reveal where they are
buried.</LD>
<LD>   The draft amendments on the media, which require passage in the
upper house and Putin's signature to become law, would bar
broadcasters and publications from spreading any information deemed
to hamper the conduct of anti-terrorism operations or endanger the
lives or health of people involved.</LD>
<TE>   The amendments, first proposed in the State Duma before the
hostage-taking, passed easily on the third and final reading on a
vote of 231 to 106.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions specifically ban publishing information about
technology, weapons, ammunition and explosives used in anti-terrorism
operations. They also forbid broadcasting of "propaganda or
justification of extremist activity" -- apparently meaning that the
public may not have access to the viewpoints of the radical groups
staging terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, the measures reflect the toughened political mood
here since the assault by suicidal Chechen militants in the heart of
the capital. In the wake of the assault, police officials were
criticized for failing to publicly identify a knockout gas that was
later blamed for 117 of the 119 hostage deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Some liberals have expressed fear that hard-liners in the security
services are using the siege as a justification to tighten state
control over many aspects of Russian life.</TE>
<TE>   Oleg Panfilov of the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations,
a Moscow-based organization that seeks to protect journalists'
rights, said the amendments send a clear message that it is no longer
acceptable to criticize the government.</TE>
<TE>   "Authorities will use these amendments selectively when there is a
need to punish dissenters -- those liberals who have been a thorn in
the flesh of Russian officials for a long time," Panfilov said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can see the state ideology changing today. This change started
with Putin's rise to power, and this change is manifested today in
the revival of the institution of censorship and Soviet-style
propaganda in the Russian media."</TE>
<TE>   A leading human rights organization, Memorial, said the law would
hamper its efforts to document human rights abuses by Russian forces
in the separatist republic of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "With the new rules being enforced, the world may lose Chechnya
from its sight altogether -- no one will know what is happening in
Chechnya and which way the situation there is going," said Tatyana I.
Kasatkina, a Memorial leader. "Anyone who dares to break the rule can
be immediately held liable for either helping terrorists or
interfering with the plans of the authorities."</TE>
<TE>   In theory, she said, if this law had been in place before the
hostage-taking last week, officials could have muzzled news
organizations and kept the entire episode a secret.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of the measure, however, said it isn't that draconian.
The intent, they said, is to stop terrorists from using the media to
promote their agendas and also to prevent broadcasters from giving
out details of security operations that would be to the advantage of
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this is a limitation of democratic freedom," said
Viktor Ozerov, a member of the Federation Council, parliament's upper
chamber. "In such situations, only information from official sources
should be used. Third-hand information should not be broadcast."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the amendments on the media, Kasatkina faulted the
change in the law that would allow authorities to secretly bury slain
attackers.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the authorities do not have to hand over the bodies
of the so-called terrorists to their relatives means only one thing:
Summary executions will be legalized as Putin will keep driving the
conflict under the carpet by using force indiscriminately in
Chechnya," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The argument for that amendment, preliminarily approved 288 to 1
with two abstentions, was that terrorist sympathizers might otherwise
make a shrine of the graves and use them as political rallying
points.</TE>
<TE>   An editor for the tabloid Versiya, Alexei Goreslavsky, said he got
a taste Friday of what the new law would mean when agents from the
Federal Security Service, or FSB, the KGB successor agency, came with
a warrant and said they wanted to impound the paper's computer.</TE>
<TE>   Goreslavsky said the officers said their inquiry was related to a
May 27 article about construction of private housing on FSB property.
But he said he believes it had more to do with coverage of the
hostage-taking siege.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very likely that the authorities have decided to crack down
on the unruly mass media -- otherwise, why else would the FSB send
eight of its officers to a paper that is just about to publish
materials that run counter to the official version of such a socially
important event as a hostage-taking incident in the capital?" he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that government pressure on journalists has been on the
rise years and that the new amendments would make their job even
tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "Journalists will have to weigh their every word," he said, "and
finally the FSB and other secret services will decide if we have gone
over the line."</TE>

<HD>Milosevic's Ill Health Delays His Trial Again</HD>
<DH>Ex-Yugoslav president is too exhausted to appear in court.
U.N. tribunal will reconvene Monday.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>The challenge of defending himself against scores of war crimes
charges has apparently taken its toll on Slobodan Milosevic, who was
too exhausted to appear in court Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The former Yugoslav president, who is 61, required medical
attention at the United Nations detention center outside The Hague,
and his trial was adjourned until Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Presiding Judge Richard May asked the prosecution and the
friends-of-the-court assigned to ensure a fair trial to submit
proposals for speeding up the trial, which appears likely to continue
for two years.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.N. tribunal said the three judges were
concerned about repeated delays and the strain on Milosevic.</TE>
<TE>   "The judges are only concerned about the obvious stress placed on
all parties, including the accused himself," spokesman Jim Landale
said. "They want to hear from the parties what could be done to
reduce that stress."</TE>
<TE>   Dragoslav Ognjanovic, a legal advisor to Milosevic, said Milosevic
began feeling ill Thursday night as a consequence of "the intensity
and rhythm of the trial."</TE>
<TE>   "His blood pressure is higher than usual," Ognjanovic said, "which
is the only reason he did not appear in court Friday."</TE>
<TE>   Landale said Milosevic was expected to recover and appear in court
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The trial, which started in February, was disrupted for several
weeks in April and in June because of Milosevic's health.</TE>
<TE>   He has a history of high blood pressure and a heart condition.
Doctors at the tribunal warned in July that he was at "a serious risk
of a heart attack" because of the stress of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic is defending himself against 66 counts of war crimes
allegedly committed during the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the
early 1990s and in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province, in 1999.</TE>

<DL>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia</DL>
<LD>Hoping to avoid armed conflict in the South China Sea, officials of
Southeast Asian countries have agreed with China on a pact that paves
the way for a binding "code of conduct" for state behavior in
contested areas.</LD>
<LD>   The initial nonbinding agreement was reached by working groups of
the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations on Friday evening before the
organization's annual summit Monday and Tuesday, Cambodia's Foreign
Ministry said. China was approached Friday night and, after
negotiations, agreed to the text of the declaration, the ministry
said.</LD>
<LD>   The code is expected to be formally approved by leaders of ASEAN
and China on Monday, diplomats said.</LD>
<TE>   ASEAN countries have tried for three years to draw up a binding
policy to prevent armed conflicts from erupting in contested areas of
the South China Sea.</TE>
<TE>   The disputed territories include the Spratly Islands, claimed in
whole or in part by China, Taiwan and ASEAN members Malaysia, the
Philippines, Brunei and Vietnam. Also contested are Scarborough Shoal
and the Paracel Islands.</TE>
<TE>   The contested areas are believed to be rich in oil and natural
gas. They straddle busy sea lanes and rich fishing grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats said agreement on the declaration was reached after
ASEAN and China compromised.</TE>
<TE>   Chem Widhya, permanent secretary of Cambodia's Foreign Ministry,

<HD>Still King of Software, Hardball</HD>
<DH>Remedies come too late to weaken Microsoft's dominance in
personal computers, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey, Joseph Menn and Glenda McCarthy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After four years of antitrust litigation that could have torn the
company apart, Microsoft Corp. today enjoys the same comfortable
position it occupied before the landmark case against it began -- on
top of the software world, looking down.</LD>
<LD>   Technology executives and analysts said the prosecution of the
most important antitrust case in a generation has done almost no
discernible harm to Microsoft.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the remedies ordered by U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly come too late to weaken Microsoft's dominance in
personal computers, and they won't slow the company's drive into a
range of new markets. Kollar-Kotelly's order excludes software for
hand-held devices, television set-top boxes and Internet-based
services -- three important arenas for Microsoft and competing
software companies.</LD>
<TE>   "What's most interesting is how much the tech landscape has
changed," said University of Chicago antitrust expert Randal Picker.
"At the beginning, we were at the dawn of the Internet era, and now
we're looking in the rearview mirror. Microsoft is still a behemoth,
and it looks like a battle between the big guys" -- Microsoft, IBM
Corp. and AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   When the Justice Department and 19 states launched their suit
against Microsoft in 1998, the Internet explosion was just beginning.
The antitrust enforcers warned that unless the firm was stopped, it
would extend its monopoly of computer desktop software to the Net,
stifling what otherwise could be an era of unprecedented innovation
and competition.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the attorneys general won the most important arguments
in the original case -- establishing Microsoft's violations and
winning the right to restrict the firm's conduct -- they couldn't
move fast enough to prevent their dire warnings from coming true.</TE>
<TE>   The last two years have been extremely tough for technology
companies, whose sales have plummeted as corporate customers
tightened their belts and consumers lost their fervor for new PCs. By
contrast, Microsoft reported record quarterly sales last month. And
it has surpassed General Electric Co. as the company with the highest
stock market value in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The Redmond, Wash.-based company has prospered in large part
because it can charge computer makers what it likes for its products.
Its Windows operating system powers more than 90% of the world's PCs.</TE>
<TE>   As Microsoft attempts to extend its hegemony from the office to
the living room -- with products such as the Xbox video game console
and MediaPlayer multimedia software -- it is bound to face
competition. In fact, Microsoft dominates few of the fields it
recently has entered.</TE>
<TE>   Gerard Tellis, professor of marketing at USC's Marshall School of
Business, said innovation is alive and well in the technology
industry, so Microsoft shouldn't be demonized for its success. The
company won its powerful position, he said, by offering quality
products.</TE>
<TE>   Tellis, an outspoken opponent of the government's antitrust
action, pointed to IBM and Xerox Corp. as examples of companies that
appeared to have a monopoly at one point but lost clout because they
weren't innovative enough. If Microsoft becomes lethargic, it could
find itself in the same position, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole industry is so competitive and so innovative it doesn't
take a huge laboratory," he said. "People can do it on their
laptops."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft executives said the ruling "imposes significant
requirements" but allows the company to keep innovating. "We
recognize that we will be closely scrutinized by the government and
our competitors, and we will devote all the time, energy and
resources needed to ensure that we meet our responsibilities," the
firm said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Even with that scrutiny, Microsoft is expected to pursue new
markets aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   The company is going after the technology that will determine how
services will be delivered over the Web. It is gaining in software
for computer servers, which power Web sites and corporate networks,
and hand-held computers at the expense of struggling competitors such
as Sun Microsystems Inc., which makes large machines, and Palm Inc.,
which makes tiny ones.</TE>
<TE>   It is also trying to establish proprietary formats for audio and
video as de facto standards for digital music and movie products and
services. It is rolling out software that places a Microsoft-powered
computer at the heart of home entertainment. And it is pushing
Windows into a new generation of Internet-enabled mobile phones.</TE>
<TE>   A key issue for Kollar-Kotelly was deciding whether to extend
restrictions on Microsoft's actions into these areas, as many of its
competitors sought. The judge focused on enabling software developers
to compete with core pieces of Microsoft's monopoly in personal
computers, but she declined to give similar protection to competitors
in other, emerging arenas.</TE>
<TE>   A good example is interactive TV software, a market in which
Microsoft has struggled to gain a foothold despite billions of
dollars in investments. Kollar-Kotelly offered protection to
competing developers of interactive TV "middleware" -- the software
that provides a foundation for applications such as electronic
program guides and video on demand -- only if their software ran on
personal computers, not on cable or satellite set-top boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell E. Kertzman, chief executive of Liberate Technologies
Inc., a San Carlos, Calif., company that makes interactive TV
software, said he was disappointed if not surprised by the limited
protection in the ruling. Still, he said Microsoft is under so much
scrutiny now, it will be harder for the firm to crush competitors
that produce revolutionary technology, as it did in the market for
Web browsers.</TE>
<TE>   "Your eternal hope in technology is that technology changes the
playing field," Kertzman said.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies said the ruling loosens
Microsoft's control over the programs that receive a prominent place
on computer screens. But he added, "In the long run, Microsoft still
is in very real control as far as the direction of the desktop PC,
and potentially how they integrate certain pieces of technology,"
particularly those related to audio and video.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, much of Microsoft's research and development has been in
consumer electronics, portable devices and other audio- and
video-oriented arenas, said analyst Richard Doherty of Envisioneering
Group, a technology research and consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y.
Those devices "are still very dependent on the PC infrastructure for
their perceived growth," giving Microsoft an important advantage, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And the area in which Kollar-Kotelly restrained Microsoft "is to
them no longer the be-all and end-all that it was from 1995 to 2000,"
Doherty said. "Had this come out four years ago, during what was
clearly the midpoint of the Internet explosion, I think it would have
had a tremendous effect."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its competitors' concerns, Microsoft isn't dominating the
new fields it has entered. For example, sales of its Xbox video game
console are running far behind those of Sony's PlayStation 2, and its
software for playing digital media is locked in a hotly competitive
race with products from RealNetworks Inc., Musicmatch Inc. and Apple
Computer Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Microsoft's ability to build support for its proprietary
security software into the Windows operating systems -- and to tie
the security uniquely to computer hardware -- gives it a leg up that
rivals simply cannot match, warned attorney Fred von Lohmann of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates civil liberties
online.</TE>
<TE>   "It becomes a whole situation where, as a content company, you're
given certain assurances [about security] by Microsoft that nobody
else can give you," Von Lohmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, officials at RealNetworks praised Kollar-Kotelly for
adding provisions that allow computer makers to launch non-Microsoft
products, such as Real's media player, when their computers are
turned on.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft may have a monopoly on operating systems, but it
doesn't have a monopoly on innovation, as we've demonstrated through
our industry leadership for years," said Real's general counsel,
Kelly Jo MacArthur.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, one casualty of Microsoft's monopoly power has been
innovation, contended Timothy Bresnahan, a professor of economics at
the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and a former
Justice Department economist who worked on the Microsoft case. After
Microsoft crushed Netscape Communications Corp. in the Internet
browser war, he said, many entrepreneurs concluded that they couldn't
obtain widespread distribution of their software or make much of a
return on their investment.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst David Smith of Gartner Inc., a technology research firm,
wasn't so convinced that Microsoft hadn't squelched new ideas or
would continue to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to see a lot more exciting things in the industry,
from big companies and little companies," regardless of the decision
on Microsoft, he said.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Wins Major Points in Antitrust Settlement Ruling</HD>
<DH>Judge's decision frees the software giant from new
sanctions. Bill Gates calls it a milestone, but California, other
states express disappointment.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge handed Microsoft Corp. a definitive legal victory
Friday by approving most provisions of a controversial antitrust
settlement with the Justice Department, all but certainly freeing the
world's biggest software company from the threat of crippling
sanctions.</LD>
<LD>   In a comprehensive ruling full of blunt language, U.S. District
Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly made clear that the agreement crafted by
outgoing federal antitrust chief Charles James struck an acceptable
balance: It reasonably restrained Microsoft from continuing to abuse
the monopoly power of its Windows operating system without hampering
the company's legitimate business practices.</LD>
<LD>   The judge's ruling gives legal force to the detailed settlement
plan, requiring Microsoft to release more technical information to
competitors about how its products tie together and to refrain from
punishing com- puter makers that install non-Microsoft programs for
tasks such as surfing the Internet or watching videos.</LD>
<TE>   California and eight other states had sought harsher remedies to
counter past and present Microsoft tactics. But many of the tactics
weren't relevant under guidelines set out by a federal appeals court,
the judge ruled.</TE>
<TE>   "This suit, however remarkable, is not the vehicle through which
plaintiffs can resolve all existing allegations of anti- competitive
conduct," Kollar-Kotelly wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and Microsoft embraced the long-awaited
ruling, and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates called it a "major
milestone" that his company plans to accept.</TE>
<TE>   "It represents a fair resolution of this case," Gates said. "I am
personally committed to full compliance."</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street saw a Microsoft victory, and investors bid up company
shares as much as 6% when the ruling was officially released after
the U.S. stock markets closed. In regular Nasdaq trading, shares fell
47 cents to close at $53.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest change in the year-old settlement plan comes in how it
will be enforced. Kollar-Kotelly adopted the renegade states' request
that compliance efforts be directed by independent Microsoft board
members, saying she would hold them accountable for any failures.
Microsoft previously had agreed to pay for a technical committee that
would investigate compliance complaints and report to the Justice
Department, which would in turn decide whether to complain to the
court.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly also gave the states wide latitude to inspect
Microsoft documents and interview employees to ensure the sanctions
are enforced. And the judge asked to keep jurisdiction of the case in
order to act quickly if she determines that Microsoft violates her
decree.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to our important, continuing involvement in
enforcement," said Iowa Atty. Gen. Tom Miller, leader of the states
that pushed for tougher provisions. "We believe that the efforts of
the nine states and the District of Columbia have resulted in an
improvement."</TE>
<TE>   The judge also took the advice of the nine holdout states and
ordered that:</TE>
<TE>   * The court would keep the authority to extend the five-year term
of the decree by two more years if Microsoft flouts the terms of the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   * Microsoft would be barred not only from retaliating against
computer makers that install non-Microsoft programs on their PCs but
also from threatening to retaliate.</TE>
<TE>   * The computer makers would be permitted to install applications
of their choosing that would launch when consumers start up
Windows-based machines.</TE>
<TE>   "These are requirements we will be able to adhere to," Gates said.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly wholly rejected more than a dozen other proposals
from the states to restrict Microsoft's leverage in such important
emerging areas as hand-held computers, Web-based services and
software for interactive television.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft praised the ruling, which he said
created a healthy environment for the computer industry to develop
"technologies with full confidence that their efforts will not be
impeded by anti-competitive practices."</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft foes blasted the decision for embracing
inconsequential measures that would do nothing to free the technology
landscape from Microsoft's domination.</TE>
<TE>   "The weak steps that Microsoft has taken to comply with the
requirements already show that the settlement will be ineffective in
curbing Microsoft's monopolistic and anti-competitive practices and
how difficult it will be to enforce," said Mike Morris, Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s special counsel. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Sun is
pursuing a private suit against Microsoft over the company's steps to
stem the spread of Sun's Java technology, once viewed as a serious
threat to the Windows monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the states' attorneys general highlighted the modest
changes in the settlement, they were clearly disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "This court focused on looking back on past behavior and trying to
make sure it doesn't reoccur, rather than applying the law to try to
prevent similar misdeeds in other business areas," California Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The states had wanted Microsoft to disclose more of Windows'
internal mechanisms and to do so earlier in the manufacturing
process, making it easier for outside programmers to design software
that works as well with Windows as Microsoft software.</TE>
<TE>   They also wanted to force Microsoft to offer a less expensive,
stripped-down version of Windows so that computer makers could modify
it and pass the savings on to consumers. And they wanted Microsoft to
give away the code for its Internet Explorer browser and license a
version of its Office suite of business productivity software --
which is more profitable than Windows -- for use on other operating
systems such as Linux.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said the states would discuss whether to appeal or file a
new suit based on allegations the judge said weren't relevant in the
remedy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Others predicted that an appeal would fall short.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a very substantial chance of succeeding on
appeal," said Albert Foer, president of the American Antitrust
Institute, a think tank favoring strong antitrust measures that had
urged Kollar-Kotelly to craft a more sweeping resolution. "The
appeals court already gave it a full shot, and my guess is the states
are tired out."</TE>
<TE>   Under the settlement, Microsoft is required to change some of its
practices. But many antitrust and technology experts said what the
large print gives, the small print takes away.</TE>
<TE>   The deal makes it easier -- though not painless -- for PC makers
and consumers to swap out Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser,
media player and other functions for competing programs.</TE>
<TE>   In practice, few home users have gone through the cumbersome
process of downloading voluminous Microsoft updates that allow them
to customize their desktops.</TE>
<TE>   And there are limits to computer makers' rights to use their
choice of "middleware," such as PC-based video players, that sit on
top of the operating system and are in turn used to run smaller
pieces of software, such as videos. To qualify for protection, some
middleware firms must be shipping at least 1 million units annually
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Over the states' objection, Kollar-Kotelly found that provision
acceptable, ruling that Microsoft improperly used its power against
potential threats to the dominance of Windows. She said less popular
types of middleware would not clearly constitute threats.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft already has been taking steps to comply with the
settlement, disclosing 272 internal interfaces governing how Windows
works with other Microsoft programs for e-mail, Web browsing and the
like.</TE>
<TE>   It also has promised to disclose, via licensing agreements, 113
protocols controlling how the operating system connects with server
computers running more powerful versions of Windows. Because the
licensing agreements call for royalty payments, some open-source
developers -- including those working on the free Linux operating
system -- say they can't incorporate the protocols in their programs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the company changed its pricing policy, setting
uniform fees for the biggest 20 computer firms.</TE>
<TE>   The most tangible result of the Justice Department deal has come
from computer makers adding competing software. In October, Gateway
Inc. said it would include the WordPerfect word-processing program
made by Corel Corp. on some lower-priced desktop machines, after
similar moves by Hewlett-Packard Co., Dell Computer Corp. and Sony
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   But the effect on Microsoft has been so slight that many say the
company is more powerful now than it was when the Justice Department
and accompanying states filed suit in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's stock price is higher than it was at the start of the
trial in October 1998. And the company's profit is nearly double what
it was when the case began.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Enderle, a technology analyst for the Giga Information Group
in Santa Clara, said Microsoft archenemies Sun Microsystems and
Oracle "are clearly disappointed" in the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he added, "there's a collective sigh of relief in Silicon
Valley because there is now some legal certainty, and companies can
get back to work."</TE>

<TE>   Ruling at a glance</TE>
<TE>   Highlights of U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's
decision in the Microsoft antitrust case.</TE>
<TE>   Overview: Approved almost all aspects of the federal settlement.
The deal prohibits Microsoft from retaliating against computer
manufacturers, allows customers to remove desktop icons for some
Microsoft features and requires that Microsoft disclose some
technical data to software developers.</TE>
<TE>   Petitioners: Denied all stricter remedies requested by the nine
non-settling states. Those states wanted Microsoft to allow users to
remove some features from Windows, to divulge the blueprints to its
Web browser and to let its Office productivity software be translated
to other operating systems.</TE>
<TE>   Scope: Criticized the strategy of the non-settling states, saying
they opted for a kitchen-sink approach to the case. She said their
proposals would not prevent new illegal conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Judge's role: Created stronger oversight capabilities for herself.
She said that Microsoft frequently minimizes the effects of its
illegal conduct and that she needs the ability to make further
changes to ensure compliance.</TE>
<TE>   Warning: Told Microsoft executives, who are responsible for the
firm's compliance with the deal, that she would be closely watching
their efforts.</TE>

<HD>Revised Abuse Policy Unveiled by Bishop</HD>
<DH>Accord with Vatican calls for tribunals to hear cases. A
statute of limitations is included.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An agreement reached by Vatican officials and a team of U.S. Roman
Catholic bishops earlier this week would revise the American
zero-tolerance policy on sexual abuse by reimposing a statute of
limitations on some cases and giving church tribunals the final word
on whether accused priests should be removed from the ministry.</LD>
<LD>   Leading U.S. bishops on Friday defended the changes, which were
hammered out in two days of negotiations in Vatican City between four
U.S. bishops and four Vatican officials.</LD>
<LD>   The negotiations began after the Vatican declined to approve the
policy adopted by U.S. bishops in June at a meeting in Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   The revised set of rules -- which church officials call norms --
"substantially confirms" the decisions made by the U.S. bishops when
they adopted their zero-tolerance policy, formally known as the
Charter to Protect Children and Young People, said Bishop Wilton
Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.</TE>
<TE>   "The bishops, bolstered by these norms, are absolutely committed
that any priest who has abused a young person will not remain in
ministry -- indeed, will be permanently removed from ministry," said
Bishop William Lori of Bridgeport, Conn. "That means past, present or
future."</TE>
<TE>   Lori, one of the four American negotiators, laid out the details
of the agreement in interviews with The Times and other news
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates for victims of sexual abuse by priests were
dismayed. The changes are a "radical departure" from the earlier
policy and will discourage victims from stepping forward, said David
Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused
by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   Copies of the revised rules are being sent to U.S. bishops over
the weekend. The bishops are scheduled to vote on them at their next
regular meeting, in Washington from Nov. 11 to 14.</TE>
<TE>   The central difference between the original policy and the
revisions is that church proceedings against accused priests would
now go to church tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   Under the original policy, if sexual abuse was admitted or proved
to the local bishop's satisfaction, the offending priest was to be
automatically removed from ministry by his bishop using
administrative procedures.</TE>
<TE>   But Vatican officials insisted that did not provide enough
protection under canon law for accused priests before bishops could
remove them from ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the cases to church tribunals means they must follow canon
law, which provides for a statute of limitations. The time limit in
canon law varies but would bar consideration of any case that
occurred before November 1983 and many other cases from the 1980s and
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Administrative proceedings face no such limit, meaning that
bishops could remove a priest no matter how long ago an act of abuse
took place. Many of the cases that have surfaced this year in the
United States involve decades-old allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, however, the Vatican will consider allowing
the prosecution of older cases if a U.S. bishop makes a request.</TE>
<TE>   The policy would still require bishops to follow any civil or
criminal law that requires reporting accused abusive priests to civil
authorities, and would not interfere with prosecution by secular
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, when a bishop receives an allegation that a
priest or deacon has sexually abused a minor, he must immediately
begin a preliminary investigation. The accused cleric will be
temporarily taken out of service administratively.</TE>
<TE>   If there is sufficient evidence, the case would be sent to the
Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith in the Vatican, now headed by
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.</TE>
<TE>   Lori said the threshold for forwarding the matter to Rome is low.
Canon law merely says to do this "if it [the accusation] at least
seems true." The Vatican congregation will normally send the case
back to the local bishop to adjudicate through a tribunal, Lori said.
But in some special cases, such as when a priest has served in more
than one diocese, he said, the Vatican may decide to try the case
itself.</TE>
<TE>   If Ratzinger's panel decides not to allow a trial -- either for
lack of evidence or because the case is too old -- "that is not the
end of the ballgame," Lori said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the bishop judges the priest or deacon is a danger to young
people, he still has executive power of governance and can take
measures to make sure that cleric is not returned to ministry," Lori
said. The norms require the bishop to take such steps. "It isn't
optional," Lori said.</TE>
<TE>   The priest would still be considered a member of the priesthood
but would not be allowed to serve in any form of ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "We bishops wanted to be bound," Lori said. "We wanted to say to
our people that our commitment is not only a promise, it's something
to which we are bound by the law of the church."</TE>
<TE>   The revised policy "will provide every diocese in the country with
standards in canon law for protecting children and young people,
reaching out to victims, assessing allegations against clergy with
the benefit of the advice of competent laypersons, and for keeping
permanently from ministry anyone who would harm children," Gregory
said in his statement.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates for victims are deeply suspicious of decision-making
by the church and see church tribunals, which operate behind closed
doors, as a potential way to cover up abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Clohessy called the new plan "a Rube Goldberg-style scheme that
ultimately may make it easier for abusers to keep or regain their
jobs,"</TE>
<TE>   "It seems that we've gone from a system where, fundamentally, one
cleric -- the local bishop -- made the decision, to a system now in
which several clerics will make the decision," Clohessy said.</TE>
<TE>   Lori said the policy's definition of sexual abuse had been revised
to address Vatican concerns that it was too broad. He said a phrase
was removed that could have resulted in bringing charges against a
priest or deacon "for what he might be thinking."</TE>
<TE>   But, Lori said, the definition still covers a broad range of
actions and need not involve an act of intercourse or the use of
force.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the bishops, the revised policy will go back to the
Vatican for an endorsement, known as a recognitio, that will make it
binding on all U.S. dioceses.</TE>

<HD>State Needs Fast Billions to Deal With Budget Crisis</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>For all the stump speeches about better schools and safer streets,
for all the mudslinging over campaign contributions and offshore tax
shelters, California's next governor will wake up Wednesday facing
one overwhelming issue.</LD>
<LD>   The winner of Tuesday's election will have barely two months to
propose at least $10 billion in budget cuts, tax increases and other
"revenue enhancements" -- and possibly as much as $20 billion, an
amount equivalent to one-fifth of the $98.9-billion state budget for
the current fiscal year, government and private experts predict.</LD>
<LD>   Every Californian could take a hit, from the richest to the
poorest, college students to senior citizens, automobile owners to
corporate executives.</LD>
<TE>   "I really don't know how they're going to deal with it," said Ted
Gibson, the former chief economist of California, who foresees a
$20-billion budget hole for 2003-04 and no easy solution in sight.
"To solve it all at once would require both massive tax increases and
massive spending cuts that I don't think the system is prepared to
handle."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the next governor could solve the problem in one fell
swoop when he proposes a new budget in January -- if he is willing
to, say, sell off the state parks system or close some state
universities.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd have to do many steps of that radical magnitude," said Jean
Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, an
independent budget research group in Sacramento. "Otherwise, I don't
think it can be done and maintain a quality of life and level of
services that voters find acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Gov. Gray Davis -- a steady leader in the polls --
won't say how he would balance the next budget. Republican challenger
Bill Simon Jr. blames Davis for the crisis and vows that he wouldn't
raise taxes, but he won't say what programs he would cut.</TE>
<TE>   State Finance Director Tim Gage has already asked state agencies
and departments to submit 2003-04 spending plans that reflect 20%
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But the problem is so huge that even some Republicans say new
taxes or higher fees are unavoidable in the short term.</TE>
<TE>   "It involves a lot of cuts in programs," said state Sen. Bruce
McPherson (R-Santa Cruz), the Republican candidate for lieutenant
governor. "Realistically, to get out of this in any short time, there
will also have to be some of what we call 'revenue enhancements,'
which is troublesome, because we're already a high-tax state."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox, who led a GOP rebellion in
this year's budget battle, is already drawing a line for the coming
debate. Cox says Republican legislators won't support new taxes or
other revenue increases.</TE>
<TE>   Davis took office in January 1999, when the economy was booming,
stock prices were soaring and the state treasury was overflowing with
an $8-billion surplus. With the enthusiastic support of the
Democrat-controlled Legislature and the acquiescence of Republicans,
Davis increased spending by 36% over the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   But the stock market started sliding and economic growth began
slowing in 2000. California's difficulties were compounded by a
costly energy crisis the following year. State income tax receipts
and other revenues plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis exploded into public view this year with a shortfall
that had reached $23.6 billion by the time the Legislature finally
passed the 2002-03 budget at the end of August. Davis signed the
1,000-page document Sept. 5, a record 67 days late.</TE>
<TE>   On paper at least, Davis achieved his fundamental goals: He
balanced the budget while preserving funding for education and other
major programs and avoiding a general tax increase in an election
year.</TE>
<TE>   But he did it by patching together a crazy quilt of cuts, tax
increases, loans, transfers and fund shifts that still have
Republicans screaming foul and financial experts shaking their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the solutions were one-time maneuvers conceived by the
best minds of the state Finance Department, such as siphoning off
$4.5 billion in tobacco settlement money, which was sold to Wall
Street investors in the form of "tobacco bonds."</TE>
<TE>   The move helped address the immediate crisis, but it creates
long-term budget difficulties by depriving the state of $500 million
in annual tobacco payments for at least 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   In the looming battle, the governor's options will be limited by a
labyrinth of voter-approved initiatives such as Proposition 98 for
education funding, federal mandates and constitutional requirements:
money that goes to schools, health care, courts, prisons, public
employee pensions and state government operations. These functions
take roughly two-thirds of general fund spending off the table.</TE>
<TE>   Propositions on Tuesday's ballot could put even more money off
limits.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone agency by agency and department by department and
asked: What can you cut?" said Susan Kennedy, Davis' Cabinet
secretary. "If you cut staff at the [Department of Motor Vehicles],
people wait longer for licenses. If you cut staff for audits and
investigations, violations increase in nursing homes, foster care and
rehab centers. You can't just cut a department's budget and not
eliminate program operations."</TE>
<TE>   Likely targets can be gleaned from this year's budget debate,
possible cuts identified by the state's legislative analyst office
and budget experts.</TE>
<TE>   In no particular order, prisons, universities and local
governments are likely to see cuts, said Gibson, the former chief
state economist.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest potential cuts, politicians and experts say, could
be considered in Medi-Cal, the state and federally funded health-care
program for millions of low-income, elderly and disabled
Californians. It's the biggest chunk of the state budget, after
education.</TE>
<TE>   For example, California could save as much as $250 million over
two years by suspending optional Medi-Cal services such as
acupuncture, dental cleanings and chiropractic and psychological
services, the analyst's office said last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, in fact, initially proposed cutting all Medi-Cal dental
benefits for adults this year. But the Senate and Assembly budget
committees rejected the proposal, illustrating a central fact about
the coming budget battle: Virtually any cuts recommended by the next
governor will face fierce resistance from legislators and special
interests.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is going to agree on how to approach this, much less solve
it," Kennedy said. "Every dollar in the budget has a cult following
behind it."</TE>
<TE>   The governor also will have to consider the effects of any
health-care cuts on local governments, because patients stripped of
Medi-Cal coverage will wind up seeking treatment for more serious
problems in hospital emergency rooms around the state, experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County, in fact, is already being forced to close
medical facilities and cut services because of a crippling budget
crisis. Cutting state health-care benefits will only intensify such
problems, state officials and independent experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers also could feel the pinch. This year, Davis suspended a
tax credit for them because of budget pressures, and some experts
expect that to happen again next year.</TE>
<TE>   If Davis wins reelection, aides expect him to continue to make
education, public safety, children's health coverage and seniors his
spending priorities. That could help shield the Healthy Families
program for uninsured children not covered by Medi-Cal and Cal Grant
college scholarships -- both expanded by Davis over the last four
years.</TE>
<TE>   On the revenue side of the equation, higher vehicle license fees
and an income-tax increase for the wealthiest Californians will get a
long look, experts say. Restoring the vehicle fees to 1998 levels
could raise about $3.8 billion. Increasing the highest individual tax
brackets could bring in roughly $2.7 billion, proponents say.</TE>
<TE>   "You need something large enough to raise substantial amounts of
revenue, and those are the big-ticket revenue options," said Ross,
whose group is an advocate for poorer Californians.</TE>
<TE>   College students are likely to face a hike in tuition fees.
Earlier this year, the legislative analyst estimated that a 10%
increase in University of California and California State University
resident fees would raise $43.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Davis reduced state park entrance fees during his first term, but
reinstating higher fees could raise as much as $20 million, the
analyst office said last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's proposal for solving this year's budget crisis included a
15% cut in state operations, a hiring freeze and cutting what he
described as "pork projects" and "padded budgets." He also advocates
cutting taxes, which he says would spur economic growth and enable
the state to "grow" its way out of the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The conservative California Taxpayers' Assn. says tax increases
shouldn't even be contemplated. The group says the state government
could save $6 billion just by eliminating fraud, waste and
mismanagement -- an estimate that other experts say is too
optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "We got here by out-of-control spending," said Larry McCarthy, the
group's president. "The biggest revenue opportunity the state of
California has is an improving economy, and the very last thing they
should be thinking about doing is slowing that recovery by raising
taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever choices are made by the next governor, finding $10
billion to fill next year's expected budget hole promises to be
painful.</TE>
<TE>   Anything more -- and most indications are that the shortfall will
be much larger -- will require a multiyear solution, experts say.</TE>

<DL>FAIRFIELD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The race for governor careened into its final weekend Friday with
Republican Bill Simon Jr. trying to keep the campaign focused on
questions about Gray Davis' ethical standards and the governor
dismissing his opponent's criticisms as desperate electioneering.</LD>
<LD>   For the third time in recent weeks, Simon raised the specter of
criminal wrongdoing by the Democratic incumbent, but offered no proof
beyond citing accusations that Davis misused state employees in 1986,
when Davis was running for state controller. The attorney general
declined to prosecute at the time, saying there was insufficient
evidence of a crime.</LD>
<LD>   An upbeat Davis, meanwhile, racked up a slew of endorsements from
Los Angeles city leaders, including Mayor James K. Hahn, and termed
Simon's latest volley "pitiful." Davis also scolded the investment
manager for trying to "parachute" into the race for governor after
failing to vote in numerous elections over the last 12 years.</LD>
<TE>   As the two candidates took their latest swipes at each other, both
campaigns locked in their final televised assaults for the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign, which plans to spend about $1.5 million in the
last four days of the race, is set to run a new commercial Sunday
attacking Davis' leadership on the state's energy crisis as well as
his fund-raising practices.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's campaign is running $4.8-million worth of
commercials over the final days of the campaign, highlighting Davis'
record and questioning Simon's credibility. Of that, $500,000 in ads
are due to run on Monday and election day.</TE>
<TE>   Simon raised the old allegations about Davis on a day when he made
three campaign stops in the northern Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   At a rally in Rocklin, the candidate and his wife, Cindy, signed a
T-shirt nailed to a crucifix that said: "Gray Davis: California's
most expensive prostitute."</TE>
<TE>   During a morning stop at a Solano County jelly bean factory, Simon
called on the governor to answer questions raised in a 1987-88
investigation by the state attorney general's office into allegations
that Davis' legislative employees worked on state time for his 1986
campaign for state controller. At the time, Davis was an assemblyman.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Reagor, a deputy attorney general, recommended then that
Davis be prosecuted, but his superiors decided not to proceed because
they lacked evidence that Davis was aware of any improprieties.
Instead, the Davis campaign settled the matter by reimbursing the
state $28,000.</TE>
<TE>   The matter was widely reported by the media at the time. On
Thursday night, KCBS-TV ran a piece recapping the investigation,
along with a new interview with Reagor, who still believes Davis
should have been prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night, KCBS in Los Angeles reported that professional
prosecutors, career prosecutors, recommended that Gray Davis should
have been prosecuted for felony embezzlement based upon statements of
his own employees," Simon told reporters in Fairfield. "These
prosecutors apparently found that Mr. Davis abused state employees
and resources to support his campaign for controller."</TE>
<TE>   When asked to explain why he was raising the old accusation,
Simon, a former federal prosecutor, tried to distance himself from
the charge.</TE>
<TE>   "Other people are raising it," Simon said. "Not me."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon's campaign was closely linked to the new report. For
weeks, it has encouraged news organizations to report on the case.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Simon campaign manager Rob Lapsley traveled with a
Republican Party consultant to Washington state to discuss it with
Reagor. The two brought with them a copy of a file about the case,
Reagor told The Times. The GOP consultant, Rob Stutzman, said he was
listening on a phone extension in the retired prosecutor's house in
Nine Mile Falls, Wash., during the KCBS interview.</TE>
<TE>   In response to questions, Simon acknowledged that his campaign
manager traveled to Washington "to verify the assertions that had
been made," but still cast the matter as coming to light through an
independent endeavor by the media.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also urged reporters to ask then-Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp
why he did not press charges against Davis. In an interview, Van de
Kamp said the investigation did not uncover enough evidence that
Davis had "personally detailed people to do what they were doing."</TE>
<TE>   Van de Kamp noted that the findings were published in a 17-page
public report in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon said the accusations were part of a pattern of ethical
lapses by Davis, and he renewed his frequent charge that the governor
has traded favors for campaign money.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the first time that Simon has made charges of
illegality against Davis. Last month, Simon was forced to apologize
after erroneously accusing Davis of accepting a political donation in
the lieutenant governor's office.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Simon raised the case of a convicted racketeer, Mark L.
Nathanson, who in an effort to lessen his sentence in 1993 accused
Davis of improper fund-raising. Prosecutors found no evidence of
wrongdoing and concluded Nathanson lacked credibility.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Davis brushed aside Simon's latest charges, saying the
Republican was just trying to distract voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Simon has got a lot of problems of his own and I think he
keeps raising these spurious charges just to deflect attention from
his lack of vision and the hot water he's currently in," Davis said,
as he cited Simon's scheduled testimony later this month in a case
involving a failed savings and loan he helped run.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also took the opportunity to chide Simon for failing
to vote in 13 out of 20 elections since he moved to California in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   "The only time he bothered to vote in the Republican primary was
when he was on the ballot," Davis said during a news conference in
Los Angeles. "Well, I think people expect a little more than that by
way of public participation before you end up in the highest office
in the land."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Los Angeles officials gathered on the steps of City Hall
to laud Davis' tenure. They included the mayor, nine City Council
members and City Controller Laura Chick.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's been education, or public safety or housing,
transportation -- Governor, you've been there for us," Hahn said. "I
know the people of Los Angeles aren't going to forget that. I know
they know what's good for them. What's good for them is another four
years of the leadership you've demonstrated."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn then led the group of assembled officials in a chant of "Four
more years!" A handful of Simon supporters gathered in the plaza
outside City Hall booed in response.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's endorsement of his fellow Democrat comes more than a
year after seven other Democratic mayors announced that they were
supporting Davis' reelection. During the 2001 mayor's race, Davis
campaigned for Hahn's opponent, former Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Davis said that Hahn had pledged his endorsement back
in June but that the governor decided to roll it out at the end.</TE>
<TE>   "He is our big hitter, we're saving him for the clutch, and this
is a good endorsement to go into the last week of the election," the
governor said.</TE>

<HD>An Off Season for Free Agents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now forming coast to coast, baseball's annual winter parade of free
agents will not receive the warm reception that the Angels did on
Main Street.</LD>
<LD>   This is not to say that the boom years of salary growth will turn
to bust, but ...</LD>
<LD>   It is likely to be a long, cold off-season for a comparatively
thin group of quality free agents.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, many other players who are arbitration eligible or
whose 2003 status is linked to option clauses may be dumped onto a
diluted and unrewarding market.</TE>
<TE>   The key reasons for this bleak forecast:</TE>
<TE>   * Alleged industry losses of $800 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   * The new bargaining agreement that taxes high payrolls and
increases the revenue-sharing burden for the clubs that have
previously driven the salary market.</TE>
<TE>   * The comparatively modest nature of the free-agent class.</TE>
<TE>   The phrase heard throughout the industry is "market correction."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the economics of the game alone will dictate a
correction, and the economics combined with the spending
disincentives in the bargaining agreement virtually ensure a
correction," Dodger President Bob Graziano said. "How big is
difficult to say, but I think we'll start to see a lessening in the
disparity between player payrolls and, in time, a correction in the
competitive imbalance because of the disincentives for the
large-market clubs to continue their wild spending."</TE>
<TE>   Said Brian Sabean, general manager of the San Francisco Giants,
during the World Series:</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's definitely going to be a buyer's market. People will
be shocked at how few clubs are going to be involved, bidding for
free agents.</TE>
<TE>   "The new agreement aside, everybody is tightening their belts."</TE>
<TE>   It is not only the economics, however.</TE>
<TE>   There is no marquee free agent, no Alex Rodriguez or Manny
Ramirez, to whose salary coattails these free agents can cling.</TE>
<TE>   After Jim Thome, who is agreeable to staying in Cleveland if the
rebuilding Indians can find a way to translate his 101 homers of the
last two years into dollars and sense, and Japanese slugger Hideki
Matsui, who has notified the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants of his desire to
play in the U.S. next year through the same posting system that
brought Ichiro Suzuki and Kazuhiro Sasaki, among others, there is
considerable falloff.</TE>
<TE>   The next tier of eligible position players, including Jeff Kent,
Cliff Floyd, Edgardo Alfonzo, Ivan Rodriguez and Steve Finley, is
beset with questions of age, injury, performance, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, a shallow list of free-agent pitchers is basically led
by 40-year-old Jamie Moyer and the 37-year-old Tom Glavine and Greg
Maddux.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine and Maddux are headed to the Hall of Fame, of course, but
whether the cost-cutting Braves can retain both, or whether the two
will receive offers commensurate with their resumes from teams grown
weary and leery of signing older pitchers to multiyear contracts, is
doubtful. Glavine, who was 18-11 with a 2.96 earned-run average this
year, has already rejected a one-year offer from the Braves for the
same $9 million he made in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Players eligible for free agency were allowed to begin filing
Monday, the day after the World Series ended. In the 15-day period
that began with that filing date, those players can talk to any
interested clubs but can receive offers only from their previous
clubs.</TE>
<TE>   An agent who represents several eligible players said he had
already concluded that few clubs, even those interested in re-signing
their own free agents, seemed willing to take advantage of the
exclusive negotiating window.</TE>
<TE>   "The impression I get is that most clubs want to follow the market
but not set it," he said. "It looks like a long winter of tough
sells."</TE>
<TE>   The players' union, of course, is always leery. Does correction
translate to collusion?</TE>
<TE>   It is far too early, a union lawyer said, to draw a conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, wasn't the union a partner to a bargaining agreement that
strikes at the New York Yankees and may take the other big spenders
out of the market?</TE>
<TE>   As John Henry, principal owner of the Boston Red Sox, told the
Boston Globe in claiming that his team's average revenue-sharing
obligation will climb from $9 million a year to $35 million:</TE>
<TE>   "With the new [collective bargaining agreement], there is no doubt
in my mind that the monetary demand for free agents and arbitration
eligible players will drop this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than having the larger revenue teams setting the market,
it will be teams like the [Pittsburgh] Pirates and [Detroit] Tigers
who will drive the market. Where they will drive it remains to be
seen. But I think this is a big plus for baseball."</TE>
<TE>   His point was that small-market clubs like the Pirates and Tigers
should be able to use their revenue-sharing increase to improve their
teams, reducing the competitive imbalance.</TE>
<TE>   Many big-market owners, however, still worry that the increase
will merely go into the recipient owner's pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Brave President Stan Kasten said he isn't really sure that in the
first year of the new agreement the recipient clubs will be receiving
enough "to go out and spend on a lot of guys" considering their
ongoing losses.</TE>
<TE>   "But," he added, "if it allows them to avoid cutting back, if it
permits them to keep the same team together, despite the certain
payroll growth that's built into the system, that's a positive and
important thing in itself."</TE>
<TE>   When revenue sharing is totally implemented in the third and
fourth years of the new agreement, the amount of money being
distributed to the smaller-market clubs will have increased from the
current $169 million to $258 million. Meantime, three teams -- the
Yankees at $171.1 million, the Texas Rangers at $131.4 million and
the Dodgers at $118.8 million -- will have to pay a tax of 17.5% on
all payroll above the initial tax threshold of $117 million, a figure
most clubs will now use as a de facto salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   With the tax hit and the increased revenue-sharing burden, the
Dodgers will have to pay $3-4 million more than before.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees' obligation may reach almost $60 million, which is why
they reportedly are considering a step they have been judicious about
avoiding during their recent domination: trading one of their
home-grown regulars, catcher Jorge Posada, to help lessen the bite of
that obligation and, perhaps, facilitate the signing of Matsui.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, sanity does not always prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Some owner may think Kenny Rogers or Doug Glanville is just the
ticket and blow out the market, despite the new consequences.</TE>
<TE>   The Baltimore Orioles and Philadelphia Phillies (who move into a
new ballpark in 2004) are expected to inflate the Thome pursuit, and
the Red Sox -- despite Henry's cautious remarks -- may join them. Who
knows, as well, about Jerry Colangelo when the Arizona Diamondbacks'
managing general partner thinks about adding Las Vegas resident
Maddux to a rotation of Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling? What's a
little more deferred salary?</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to say how it will play out, but maybe there was a
lesson in the underdog-dominated playoffs, especially a World Series
pitting the mid-level payrolls of the Angels and Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig would call it an aberration, but others
might be reminded of the feasibility and possibility of building a
championship team from within, as the Angels basically did, and
securing it with careful signings that stayed ahead of the market.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody preaches scouting and development," the Dodgers'
Graziano said, "but you've got to be patient to do that."</TE>
<TE>   So, it took the Angels 42 years to reach and win their first World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a new kind of bargaining agreement may help foster patience.</TE>

<KH>BOXING / STEVE SPRINGER</KH>
<HD>His Career Is All About Living 'La Vida Loca'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He is 35 years old. He has been through enough battles, both inside
and outside the ring, to make him feel like 65, his boxing style
requiring him to sometimes receive almost as much punishment as he
inflicts. He has won five titles, fought many of the big names and
been one of his sport's most popular, colorful and controversial
figures for 15 years.</LD>
<LD>   So what's left for Johnny Tapia? Why does he keep fighting?</LD>
<LD>   "Because," he said, "it's the only way I can hit somebody without
going to jail."</LD>
<TE>   The man's not kidding. Violence has been a part of Tapia's life,
what he calls "mi vida loca" or "my crazy life" as long as he can
remember. At least in the ring, he gets rewarded for it.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Tapia was 8 years old, both of his parents had been
murdered. Also as a youngster, he was a passenger in a bus that
tumbled off a cliff. Several passengers died in the wreck, but Tapia,
then 7, escaped with a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   As an adult, his troubles continued, but by then he was causing
his own problems. Tapia has a 21-page police record in Albuquerque,
where he was born and raised and served time in jail on several
occasions. He has been charged with selling shaved soap to an
undercover cop while claiming it was cocaine, intimidating a witness
and assaulting his wife, Teresa, with a gun. He once bragged that the
Bernalillo County Detention Center in Albuquerque was his "second
home."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Tapia was banned from boxing for 3 1/2 years for cocaine
addiction. He has overdosed twice and attempted suicide several
times. He was once thrown from a car in front of an Albuquerque fire
station, suffering from an overdose. He was revived at a nearby
hospital and, by the time police arrived, had escaped out a window.</TE>
<TE>   Tapia has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which may help
explain his behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Considering all Tapia has been through, the challenge facing him
tonight -- imposing as it is -- is hardly worth sweating over. Tapia
will enter the ring in Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena for
tonight's 12-round main event to face arguably the best featherweight
in the world. Marco Antonio Barrera (55-3, 39 knockouts) is coming
off a close but unanimous decision over Erik Morales in June. Barrera
has won six consecutive matches, including a victory last year over
previously undefeated Naseem Hamed.</TE>
<TE>   Tapia (52-2-2, 28), a 4-1 underdog, has won four in a row since
losing a decision to Paulie Ayala in October 2000. Ayala also handed
Tapia his other defeat, winning by decision in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Although both fighters are coming off victories over titleholders,
neither has a championship belt. It's another sign the power of the
sanctioning organizations continues to wane.</TE>
<TE>   Barrera had announced before fighting Morales that he wouldn't
accept Morales' World Boxing Council featherweight title if he won
because he refused to pay the sanctioning fees. Tapia accepted the
International Boxing Federation featherweight crown he won from
Manuel Medina in April, but then was stripped of it.</TE>
<TE>   "They took it away from me," Tapia said. "Every fighter in the
world always looks forward to getting a belt. I won the belt by
working hard and fighting hard. Then, they took it away from me."</TE>
<TE>   It's a little more complicated than that. Tapia was obligated to
fight Juan Marquez, the IBF's mandatory challenger. When Tapia
decided instead to fight Barrera, he could have appealed for an
exemption. But under IBF rules, Tapia would have been required to pay
$20,000 for a hearing; he refused.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, that might have killed this fight. Promoters and
television executives have long demanded titles to bestow legitimacy
on their matches. But they are realizing it's the names on the
trunks, not the titles on the belts, that draw the fans.</TE>
<TE>   And Barrera and Tapia offer recognizable names.</TE>
<TE>   One thing Tapia is not offering this time is trash talk. Many of
his fights turned bitter in the days before the match, the threats
and verbal attacks drowning out serious discussion of fighting styles
and strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Even Barrera, who usually shows nothing but class and offers
nothing but respect for an opponent, got caught in ugly personal
attacks in his second fight with Morales after Morales won a close
but controversial decision the first time around.</TE>
<TE>   But for this fight, both men have stuck to the high road. They are
old friends whose families are also close. Tapia refers to Barrera as
"the king of the featherweights."</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean this will be a love fest.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were the oddsmaker, I would make it 99-1 [in Tapia's
favor]," Tapia said. "You will have to kill me in the ring to beat
me.</TE>
<TE>   "I am willing to get cut. I am willing to get black eyes, broken
noses, broken ribs. Whatever he wants to do to me, I will still be
there. I know I can go to the hospital and still get fixed up."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like another crazy night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Vargas, who tested positive for an illegal steroid after
his September fight against Oscar De La Hoya, will finally get his
long-awaited hearing before the Nevada State Athletic Commission
sometime during the final two weeks of November. The commission is
considering a suspension of up to a year.... De La Hoya, hoping to
lure Felix Trinidad out of retirement for a rematch against the man
who beat him in 1999, is still trying to schedule a meeting with
Trinidad in his native Puerto Rico.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tennessee sophomore receiver Kelley Washington is out indefinitely
while recovering from a concussion and his college career could be
over.</LD>
<LD>   Washington, who nearly entered the NFL draft last winter, is
Tennessee's leading receiver with 23 catches for 443 yards, despite
playing only four games.</LD>
<LD>   Tennessee will also be without defensive linemen Demetrin Veal
(calf) and Ed Kendrick (shin) today against South Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The fight between Washington State linebacker Ira Davis and
cornerback Jason David was over a woman, according to the Seattle
Times. Davis has been suspended and David suffered three fractures to
his right cheekbone and will be out up to six weeks. The paper said
Davis became upset after a woman he had been dating told him that
David had been making advances toward her. The woman has since
acknowledged that David did not make advances after all. The Cougars
have other problems. Receiver Mike Bush (sprained ankle) is expected
to play today against Arizona State, but receiver Collin Henderson
(collarbone) will only hold for kicks. Receiver Scott Lunde (broken
vertebra, lower back) is out, and linebacker Al Genatone is battling
flu.... Wyoming receiver and team captain Ryan McGuffey was suspended
indefinitely after being charged with drunken driving.... Oregon
State is planning an expansion of Reser Stadium from its current
capacity of 35,362 to 43,000, with a long-range goal of increasing
capacity to 55,000.... A fire at Memphis' Murphy Athletic Complex
destroyed an indoor practice facility. The cause of the blaze is
under investigation.</TE>

<HD>O'Sullivan's Assist Was a Minor Feat</HD>

<LD>Defenseman Chris O'Sullivan picked up his first assist since the
1999-2000 season on Thursday. His reward: a trip to Cincinnati -- the
minor leagues. He was moved to clear a spot for Pavel Trnka, who has
recovered from a groin injury.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew that this was only going to be for a short time,"
O'Sullivan said. "All I can do is work hard and hope I get a chance
to help this team again."</LD>
<LD>   That was the plan when General Manager Bryan Murray signed
O'Sullivan and other fringe NHL players during the off-season. Lack
of depth in the organization had been a problem in previous seasons,
including last season.</LD>
<TE>   O'Sullivan played in two games, in place of Fredrik Olausson, who
was a healthy scratch, and helped the Ducks' power play get in gear
in the second period Thursday. O'Sullivan fired a shot from the point
that was stopped. In the scrum that followed, Paul Kariya knocked the
puck in. O'Sullivan did not get an assist on the play, but got one
later on another Kariya power-play goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally we have some depth, guys in Cincinnati who can contribute
when we bring them up," Murray said. "We have never had that before."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are also getting contributions from center Jason Krog,
who has played the last two games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Cullen has thrived with his return to playing center for the
Mighty Ducks. He has three goals in three games.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen was moved back to center four games ago, after Adam Oates
suffered a broken left hand against Vancouver. Cullen has clicked as
a goal scorer, getting the game-winner in a 4-1 victory over Boston
on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He scored against Toronto to tie the score, 1-1, in a game the
Ducks lost, 5-2, Monday. He also scored in a 2-2 tie with Montreal on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been a completely smooth transition, though. Cullen has
struggled in the faceoff circle. He won only one of eight draws
against Edmonton last Saturday, three of 16 against Toronto and two
of 10 against Boston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The World Series trophy will be on display Sunday at the Arrowhead
Pond during the Ducks' game against San Jose. The trophy can be seen
on the arena's main level.</TE>

<HD>Attorney: Bet Was Legitimate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The attorney for Derrick Davis, the Baltimore bettor who has been
implicated in the pick-six scandal at last Saturday's Breeders' Cup,
said Friday that his client would be exonerated.</LD>
<LD>   In Kentucky, the Thoroughbred Times reported that Davis, 29, and
Chris Harn, the Autotote Corp. software engineer who was fired on
Thursday, attended Drexel University in Philadelphia at the same
time.</LD>
<LD>   Donald Groth, president of the Catskill Off-Track Betting Corp. in
New York, had said Thursday that Davis and Harn, also 29, were
partners in a scheme in which six winning pick-six tickets, worth
more than $3 million in payoffs, were altered to ensure winners after
as many as four of the six Breeders' Cup races had been run.</LD>
<TE>   Groth predicted that Davis, whose tickets cost $1,152, would not
be able to cash them after the New York State Racing and Wagering
Board completed its investigation. The Breeders' Cup put the tickets
in limbo Monday after Autotote reviewed unusual horse-selection
patterns on the tickets. Davis made his bets through a telephone
account with Catskill OTB. If Davis' tickets are thrown out, the
entire net pick-six pool -- $3.4 million -- would be shared by those
who had tickets with five winners.</TE>
<TE>   "My client's bet was a legitimate bet," said Steven A. Allen, who
is Davis' attorney. "He's concerned about some of the wild
accusations that have damaged his reputation. When all of this ends,
it will be shown that this was a legitimate ticket and that nothing
irregular occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Allen wouldn't answer questions about the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Racing Assn., which is responsible for the Breeders'
Cup's initial inquiry into the pick six, has asked the state wagering
board to investigate two pick-six payoffs -- for $421,998 and
$330,389 -- in August at Saratoga. There was only one winning ticket
both days. Tim Smith, commissioner of the National Thoroughbred
Racing Assn., said that he is not aware of any other investigations
into betting payoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The NTRA and the Breeders' Cup, reacting to the controversial pick
six, announced Friday that they had formed what has been called a
"wagering technology working group," which includes several industry
executives plus Jim Quinn, an author and handicapper.</TE>
<TE>   "This will not be some drawn-out academic study," Smith said. "By
taking a long look at all the aspects of wagering technology, we must
double our efforts to keep the confidence of the betting public. This
will be a big challenge. We not only need to repair bettor
confidence, we need to enhance it."</TE>
<TE>   Sherwood Chillingworth, executive vice president of the Oak Tree
Racing Assn., said that there had been some changes at Santa Anita in
preparation for today's guaranteed $1-million pick six.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing everything possible to prevent any abnormalities,"
Chillingworth said. "We've changed the locks on the doors to the tote
room. We'll have a special guard at the door, and we've installed a
security camera in the room."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Julie Krone, riding for the first time since April 19, 1999,
finished fourth aboard Justly Royal in the fifth race at Santa Anita.
Justly Royal was squeezed at the start and lacked running room in the
stretch before finishing two-plus lengths behind winner Silky
Summer.... Krone, 39, who has 3,545 victories, has three mounts in
today's California Cup card and two on Sunday.</TE>

<LD>Brandon Mebane set the tone by sacking Fremont quarterback Michael
Beach on the first play of the game. Crenshaw followed his lead and
ended the Pathfinders' hopes for an undefeated season.</LD>
<LD>   Tight end Chris Porter's 16-yard touchdown reception in the fourth
quarter broke a tie and the Cougar defense put the clamps on Fremont
in a 28-21 victory at home Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Crenshaw (5-3, 3-0 in league) grabbed first place in the Coliseum
League and can clinch the title with victories over Locke and Dorsey.</LD>
<TE>   "It's hard to say if we've got control," Crenshaw Coach Robert
Garrett said of the league race. "Every week in this league is
tough."</TE>
<TE>   Fremont (7-1, 2-1) had been averaging nearly 49 points but was
held to 153 total yards. Beach was sacked six times and completed six
of 15 passes for 92 yards. One of those sacks, by Kristian Thompson
and Dary Adway, ended the Pathfinders' hopes on their final drive.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Mebane was the difference in the football game,"
Fremont Coach Pete Duffy said. "Their defensive line played great. We
made some miscues on offense. Stuff was there but they didn't get it
done."</TE>
<TE>   Mebane not only shined on defense, but he twice lined up at
fullback and finished long first-half drives with two-yard touchdown
runs. On defense, he was dominant with two sacks and a fumble
recovery that set up Crenshaw's winning drive.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Andrew Simpson and wide receiver Daymeion Hughes
connected on pass plays of 12, 20 and six yards during a nine-play,
61-yard drive, which ended with Simpson finding a wide-open Porter in
the end zone with 9:13 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson, who took over as the starting quarterback three weeks
ago, completed 17 of 26 passes for 184 yards.</TE>

<TE>   Gardena 25, Wilmington Banning 21 -- LaFerrell Payne scored the
game-winning touchdown on a 22-yard run with 26 seconds to play to
give the Panthers a come-from-behind victory over host Banning in a
Marine League game. Gardena (6-2, 3-0) will play Carson next week for
first place in the league.</TE>
<TE>   The Pilots (4-4, 2-1) scored first when Damian Satete completed a
pass in the flat to Robert Garcia, who went 21 yards for the score
with 3:07 left in the first half. Gardena punted on its next
possession and with six seconds left in the half, the Pilots again
tried a swing pass from deep in their territory and Panther Craig
Batiste intercepted it and went 10 yards to make it 7-6 at the half.</TE>
<TE>   Pilot halfback Patrick Perry, who led all rushers with 153 yards
in 19 carries, scored two touchdowns in the third quarter on runs of
10 and 53 yards. Fred Earles, who carried the ball twice, scored on a
40-yard run to pull Gardena within eight at the end of three
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   -- Rafer Weigel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys Grant 25, North Hollywood 22 -- Israel Salas rushed 15
times for 145 yards and three touchdowns, including a 31-yarder with
2:36 left in the game, and the host Lancers (6-2, 3-0) overcame an
injury to star running back Anthony Dickson for the second
consecutive week in a come-from-behind Sunset Six League victory.</TE>
<TE>   Dickson sustained a hip injury on his first carry, a two-yard
gain, and left for good in the second quarter, when the Lancers
trailed, 9-6. Jorge Puerto kicked a 20-yard field goal and Marlon
Lucky scored on a 46-yard run to give North Hollywood (5-3, 1-2) a
22-13 lead with 44 seconds left in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky finished with 137 yards and two touchdowns in 20 carries.</TE>

<TE>   Roosevelt 14, Garfield 12 -- Manual Hertado intercepted a pass in
the end zone with 3:47 left and Roosevelt ran out the clock to win
the 67th East Los Angeles Classic before a crowd of approximately
25,000 at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Zach Owens returned the opening kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown
and Jody Adewale gained 123 yards in 17 carries for Roosevelt (7-1,
3-0), which won for the third consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Magana completed 10 of 18 passes for 176 yards and two
touchdowns for Garfield (4-4, 2-1), including a 15-yard touchdown
pass to Daniel Anguiano on the Bulldogs' first drive of the second
half.</TE>

<HD>Ayala Rips Apart Chino Mystique</HD>
<DH>Bulldogs hand No. 2 Cowboys their first loss, 21-14, after
falling behind by two touchdowns in the first quarter.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Talk about undressing an opponent.</LD>
<LD>   Defensive back Robert Meza's tackle of Chino running back Kes
Ekpre-Olomo early in the third quarter Friday night wasn't the only
crucial play Chino Hills Ayala made during its 21-14 upset victory,
but none was more symbolic.</LD>
<LD>   Meza inadvertently ripped the dark blue pants off Ekpre-Olomo on a
night when Ayala exposed a number of weaknesses in previously
impenetrable Chino, No. 2 in The Times' rankings.</LD>
<TE>   After spotting the Cowboys a 14-0 lead in the Sierra League game's
first eight minutes, No. 21 Ayala moved the ball effortlessly against
a defense that had limited opponents to 7.7 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs (7-1, 3-0) also shut down a vaunted rushing attack,
hindered by the loss of Jacob Flowe, who sat out with an ankle
injury. After rushing for 103 yards and two touchdowns in the first
quarter, Ekpre-Olomo was held to 67 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a bunch of kids that just don't quit," Ayala Coach Lou
Randall said. "When [Chino] went ahead, 14-0, no heads were down."</TE>
<TE>   Big plays on defense and special teams made the difference in the
fourth quarter. Defensive end Ryan Siess recovered an Ekpre-Olomo
fumble at the Chino 22-yard line with 11 minutes left. Two plays
later, Meza broke two tackles and scored on a 16-yard run to put
Ayala ahead, 19-14. Corey Tello ran in the conversion to make it
21-14.</TE>
<TE>   Chino (7-1, 2-1) drove to the Ayala 33 on its next possession
before Meza knocked away Kevin Glaab's pass on fourth down. The
Cowboys were set to get the ball back for another drive with less
than four minutes left, but a punt was fumbled and Bulldog defensive
back Patrick Stitt recovered it. Ayala then ran out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Meza, who gained 58 yards in eight carries, was one of three
rushers who befuddled Chino when running out of the wing-T. Steven
Toliver ran for 70 yards in 12 carries and Tello added 69 yards in 16
rushes.</TE>
<TE>   Ekpre-Olomo's last significant carry came on the 17-yard run in
which his pants were ripped off. Teammates huddled around him on the
sidelines to protect his privacy until Oscar Roman took off his pants
and gave them to Ekpre-Olomo as the Chino crowd roared its approval.</TE>
<TE>   Chino took a 14-0 lead on touchdown runs of three and 12 yards by
Ekpre-Olomo. But Ayala's Tello scored on a one-yard run and
quarterback Bryan Waggener found tight end Justin Davenport racing
into the end zone for a 19-yard touchdown to make it 14-13 at
halftime.</TE>

<LD>All Patrick Fuller has heard about since arriving at Covina Charter
Oak is the rivalry between the Chargers and Hacienda Heights Los
Altos.</LD>
<LD>   Teammates and coaches have inundated the junior transfer from
Pasadena Muir with stories about the teams' swapping Miramonte League
and Southern Section championships over the last four years.</LD>
<LD>   Friday night at Charter Oak, Fuller proved he got the point. He
rushed for 139 yards and a touchdown in 20 carries and returned a
kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown in leading Charter Oak to a 31-16
victory.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't know the history," said Fuller, who made his second
start of the season in place of Aaron Capers, who is academically
ineligible. "But everyone was talking about it. It gave me a boost."</TE>
<TE>   Charter Oak (7-1, 2-0 in league), ranked No. 18 by The Times, and
No. 11 Los Altos (6-2, 1-1) have alternated as league champions the
last four years and have combined to win the last four Division VII
titles. They played each other in the last three Division VII
championship games, with Charter Oak winning last year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Charter Oak is ranked No. 3 in the Southern Section
Division VI poll and Los Altos is No. 1. It's been that way all
season, and most of the last three in Division II.</TE>
<TE>   "We're like the second relative around here," Charter Oak Coach
Lou Farrar said. "But we can play football. There's no question about
that."</TE>
<TE>   Charter Oak took a 17-6 halftime lead on a 44-yard field goal by
Jonathan Granger, then extended it to 24-6 on a 17-yard pass play
from Michael Perry to Rafael Falcon on the third play of the second
half. Fuller set up the score with a 54-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   Los Altos got a 43-yard field goal by Peter Suarez to close to
within 24-9, but Fuller took back the ensung kickoff for a 31-9 lead
with 2:39 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Oak limited Los Altos to 51 yards in the fourth quarter
until a late drive resulted in a Los Altos touchdown with 19 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>

<TE>   Corona Centennial 49, Norco 21 -- A no-huddle offense helped the
Huskies make quick work of their Mountain View League opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Centennial, ranked No. 15 by The Times and No. 1 in the Division V
poll, scored six consecutive times after its opening drive and had
the ball on the Norco five-yard line 15 seconds before halftime, but
an eventual field goal try failed.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Shaun Lewis led Centennial (7-1, 3-0) by completing 14
of 22 passes for 330 yards. He passed for touchdowns of 11, 32 and 24
yards as the Huskies took a 35-point halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Terrell Jackson, who scored on a 33-yard run up the
middle four minutes into the game, finished with 142 yards and four
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Toby Gerhart of Norco (4-4, 2-1) carried 23 times for
167 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark 35, Agoura 7 -- Cliff Cardwell rushed for a school-record
292 yards and two touchdowns in 24 carries and host Moorpark opened
up a 14-0 lead and never looked back in a Marmonte League victory.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Deirmendjian scored on a 14-yard fumblerooski run with 8:37
left in the first half to pull Agoura (5-3, 3-2) to within 14-7, but
the Chargers never threatened again.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Blum ran 21 yards for a touchdown, his second of the half to
give No. 24 Moorpark (8-0, 5-0) a 21-7 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Agoura's Dustin Croick completed 15 of 35 passes for 195 yards,
but the senior committed four turnovers, including two fumbles and
had a pass intercepted in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark, No. 4 in Division IV, came into the game with a Southern
Section best 50 points allowed for the season and held Agoura, No. 10
in Division IV, to 51 yards rushing.</TE>

<TE>   Gardena Serra 14, Encino Crespi 0 -- There's no denying what has
enabled the unbeaten Cavaliers to win eight consecutive games: speed.</TE>
<TE>   Two long touchdowns helped Serra (8-0, 3-0), ranked No. 1 in
Division X, move closer to wrapping up the Del Rey League
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Devin Stearns was on the receiving end of a 78-yard touchdown pass
play and William Boyd ran 87 yards for a touchdown on the opening
kickoff of the second half to account for the game's only scores.</TE>
<TE>   The victory puts Serra in ideal position to win the Del Rey title
after knocking off its two toughest league foes, Cathedral and Crespi
(6-2, 2-1), the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   On Serra's only score of the first half, quarterback Corey Jones
threw a high, hanging spiral down the middle, and Stearns grabbed it
out of nowhere and raced into the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "I just saw it and went to get it," said Stearns, a heavily
recruited senior receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Crespi, No. 8 in Division X, was led on defense by lineman Kurtis
Hodgins, who helped prevent Serra from putting together any scoring
drives.</TE>
<TE>   Serra's defense, however, dominated throughout. Crespi's best
chance to score was in the third quarter, when quarterback Michael
Hart fumbled on the one-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley Los Amigos 49, Garden Grove 13 -- Anthony Matagi
and the Lobos took a major step toward repeating as Garden Grove
League champions with a victory at Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Matagi rushed for 171 yards and scored four touchdowns in 11
carries to lead Los Amigos (6-2, 4-0), No. 7 in Division IX.</TE>
<TE>   The Lobos can clinch the league title with a victory next week
over Garden Grove Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   Matagi scored on runs of 80, 39 and four yards and also caught a
pass that went for a 53-yard touchdown from quarterback Maopu Tuato
that helped give Los Amigos a 35-13 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Tuato completed four of five passes for 118 yards, gained 90 yards
rushing in nine carries, including 55- and 27-yard touchdown runs.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Jose Calderon completed seven of 18 passes for 148
yards with two interceptions for Garden Grove (5-3, 3-2).</TE>
<TE>   -- Mark Alai</TE>

<TE>   Claremont 34, Rancho Cucamonga 10 -- Jamaal Floyd rushed for 169
yards and three touchdowns in the Wolfpack's Baseline League victory
at home.</TE>
<TE>   Claremont (6-1, 3-0), No. 4 in Division II, held the rushing
attack of Terrell Thomas and Josh Sayles to a combined 48 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolfpack also held Rancho Cucamonga (4-3-1, 2-1) without a
first down in the second and third quarters.</TE>
<TE>   A 47-yard pass from Matt McDonald to Carlos Castillo early in the
fourth quarter increased Claremont's lead to 27-3, and Floyd added an
11-yard touchdown run.</TE>

<DH>Southland Has Abundance of Talented Wide Receivers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Bradford saw the magazine when it circulated at the end of
summer. There was the most heralded prospect on the cover, flashing
an All-American smile, representing the one player everyone was going
to talk about during this high school football season.</LD>
<LD>   Bradford was looking at Woodland Hills Taft senior receiver Steve
Smith, and he had no problem with that call.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm happy for him," said Bradford, a star receiver himself for
Fremont High. "I've known him since we were 13 or 14. He works hard.
He deserves everything he gets."</LD>
<TE>   Any conversation about the best wide receivers in California
usually begins with the immensely talented Smith. With 211 receptions
in his three-year varsity career before Friday, he will go down as
one of the state's finest athletes in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   "I like him," Franklin Coach Armando Gonzalez said of Smith. "I
wish I had him."</TE>
<TE>   But Smith is only one of many talented senior receivers coming out
of Southern California this year. Whitney Lewis of Ventura St.
Bonaventure, Quintin Daniels of L.A. Loyola and Devin Stearns of
Gardena Serra are other top-level recruits drawing attention from
major college programs.</TE>
<TE>   The others reside in the City Section. In what is the year of the
receiver, the section is home to Smith, Bradford, B.J. Vickers of
Venice, Brandon Powers of Franklin, Gary White of Jefferson and Greg
Chatman of Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting expert Allen Wallace said the depth of talent sets the
position apart in what he called a down year overall in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   "They all can be super talents at the college level," Wallace
said. "These guys aren't just good prospects. Smith, Bradford and
Lewis are guys that have been identified as ones that will play in
the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Taft Coach Troy Starr thinks the intangibles of the position and
pure football knowledge are what set Smith, the reigning City Section
player of the year, apart.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve's definitely in a class by himself," Starr said. "Superior
eye-hand coordination. Terrific leaping ability. He's got pure
football skills, some things you can't measure with a stopwatch."</TE>
<TE>   But Smith is only one of a number of prolific receivers on his own
team. Paul Pratt, the Toreadors' No. 3 receiver, led the team with 38
catches for 639 yards and 12 touchdowns going into Friday's game.
Noah Smith is drawing Division I attention with his blazing speed.</TE>
<TE>   Another prize catch is the 6-3, 200-pound Vickers. Often using his
imposing frame to fend off smaller players, the senior was averaging
24.4 yards on 36 receptions and had 13 touchdowns going into Friday's
game. Venice also has 6-2 Antwuan Giddens (30 receptions, 584 yards)
on the other side to keep defenses honest.</TE>
<TE>   "B.J. has great vision," Venice Coach Angelo Gasca said. "And he's
better after the catch. With his size and speed, he's what everybody
is looking for in a receiver."</TE>
<TE>   Vickers said the recruiting process has been more intense than he
thought it would be. That doesn't keep him from eyeing his future.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach [Gasca] tells me that I'll be great at the high school
level but that I've also got to look past that," said the senior, who
is being recruited by Oregon, Washington, Michigan State, Tennessee
and others. "[Steve's] at a school that wins championships. But I
know that [winning at] this level doesn't matter anyway. I want to
play in the NFL one day."</TE>
<TE>   Fremont Coach Pete Duffy said the 6-1, 185-pound Bradford is the
most level-headed player he has coached.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the type of guy that kids just rally around," Duffy said.
"It doesn't matter if he's catching a touchdown pass or running a
decoy for us. He only catches five or six balls a game. We could get
him the ball nine or 10 times a game and he'd have amazing stats, but
he doesn't need that."</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson's White doesn't have the big numbers either, but his
coach, Doi Johnson, is his biggest fan. White engineered the
Democrats' upset of Gardena earlier this year with a game-winning
35-yard reception in the final minute and a game-saving interception
at the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   "No disrespect to anybody, but Gary White is one of the best
receivers in the City," Johnson said. "He deserves to be mentioned in
the same breath as Steve Smith. He's that good."</TE>
<TE>   One player putting up big numbers is Powers. The 6-2 senior from
Franklin entered play this week among Southland leaders with 50
receptions for 980 yards and 15 touchdowns. Powers, who wasn't on the
recruiters' radar this summer, said Arizona State and Washington
State have shown some interest.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying hard to put up numbers," he said. "It makes me work
that much harder to get my name out there."</TE>
<TE>   The common thread with all of them is an affinity for the big play
that electrifies a crowd. It's why Bradford wants to be a receiver in
college.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the excitement of playing with the game on the line and
catching an end zone pass in between two defenders," he said. "The
thrill of that is what makes me want to play there."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace said Southern California is getting a big thrill out of
watching all of these athletes in action.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember a time where there's been such a conglomerate of
players at that particular position," he said.</TE>

<LD>Senior running back Adam Sandoval rushed for 117 yards and three
touchdowns in 21 carries and Santa Fe Springs Santa Fe defeated
Whittier Pioneer, 35-16, in a Del Rio League game Friday at Pioneer.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Fe (6-2, 3-0 in league), the defending league champion, led
throughout as Sandoval scored on a seven-yard run and two one-yard
runs.</LD>
<LD>   His last touchdown gave the Chiefs their final margin of victory
with 4:24 to play and effectively squelched a fourth-quarter comeback
attempt by Pioneer (7-1, 2-1), No. 1 in the Southern Section Division
VII rankings going into the game.</LD>
<TE>   The Titans scored on their first two possessions of the last
quarter to close within 21-16 with 9:54 to play, but Santa Fe, ranked
No. 2 in Division VII, answered with consecutive scoring drives.</TE>

<LD>The hottest horse entering the 13th California Cup is Stoney, a
4-year-old Bold Badgett gelding owned by Cyndi and Stephen Weeks and
trained by Rafael Becerra.</LD>
<LD>   Stoney enters the $50,000 Starter Sprint Handicap on a four-race
win streak. He hasn't lost since being claimed by his current
connections for $20,000 on May 31 at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Having shown he can win with or without the early lead, Stoney is
the 6-5 favorite in the six-furlong race and looks like the most
probable winner on the 10-race card.</LD>
<TE>   Those looking to single him in the $1 million guaranteed pick six
are out of luck, however. Stoney is running in the fourth race and
the pick six, which has a two-day carry-over of $359,906, doesn't
begin until the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The other nine races are: the $50,000 Starter Handicap, 1 1/2
miles on turf; (the $150,000 Matron at 1 1/16 miles; the $125,000
Juvenile at 1 1/16 miles; the $100,000 Distance Handicap at 1 1/4
miles on turf; the $150,000 Sprint at six furlongs; the $150,000
Distaff at about 6 1/2 furlongs on turf; the $250,000 Classic at 1
1/8 miles; the $175,000 Mile on turf; and the $125,000 Juvenile
Fillies at 1 1/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The $175,000 Mile, where it's difficult to throw
out many of the 14 entrants.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bay Meadows jockeys Russell Baze and Jason Lumpkins,
who, through Thursday, had combined for 173 victories.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Trainer Tom Stewart, whose 52 starters have three
victories this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Stoney in the fourth,
using Nicole's Pursuit, Calzada Kid and Exclusiveandcatty in the
fifth and singling Stormy Jack in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/68. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $11/$384. Total money bet: $422.</TE>

<HD>Big Payoffs From Trade With Boston</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a year ago, the Kings made big news when they acquired
high-scoring center Jason Allison in a trade from Boston for forwards
Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray.</LD>
<LD>   Allison, who will be sidelined for at least two months because of
a knee injury, has emerged as a point-a-game player, leading the
Kings in scoring last season and ranking among league leaders before
his injury.</LD>
<LD>   But Allison wasn't the only player the Kings received from Boston.</LD>
<TE>   Considered somewhat of a throw-in at the time, winger Mikko
Eloranta has been a major surprise for Coach Andy Murray. Skating on
the Kings' "Headache Line" with Ian Laperriere and Brad Chartrand,
Eloranta always gets the job done defensively. But this season, he
has added more offense to his game.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming here in a trade like I did last season was a big change
for me," said Eloranta, who has two goals and five points in 11 games
after scoring 18 in 77 games last season. "After Christmas, I started
feeling more comfortable and I'm just continuing this season."</TE>
<TE>   Eloranta, 30, represented Finland this year at the Salt Lake City
Olympics and played two seasons with Boston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winger Adam Deadmarsh, who did not play in Thursday's overtime
loss at Chicago because of a right wrist injury, is listed as
questionable for tonight's game against the Nashville Predators at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Tests on Friday revealed Deadmarsh's injury is only a sprain.
Deadmarsh, who suffered the injury at Columbus last Sunday, was
examined by Kerlan-Jobe hand specialist Dr. Norman Zemel and did not
practice.</TE>

<HD>Bryant Looks Like a Winner</HD>
<DH>He records a spectacular triple-double (33 points, 15
rebounds, 12 assists) as Lakers beat Clippers to the victory column
with a 108-93 decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One team ran an offense. The other didn't. One team defended its
basket as if its season depended on it. The other didn't. One team
seized moment after moment. The other didn't.</LD>
<LD>   This L.A. hoops story was the same as it ever was.</LD>
<LD>   By game's end, after the Lakers had sufficiently schooled the
Clippers on the fundamentals, it was clear one Southland basketball
team might truly be headed for an 0-7 start. The Lakers took a 108-93
victory Friday from the Clippers before a record crowd of 20,474 at
Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant led the Lakers (1-2) where they needed to go, scoring
33 points, taking a career-best 15 rebounds and adding 12 assists. It
was his fourth career triple-double and he accomplished it before the
fourth quarter began.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers (0-2) made one strong run at the Lakers near the end
of the third quarter, drawing within 74-67 on two free throws from
Corey Maggette with four minutes left. Moments later, Bryant raced
ahead of a pack of chasing Clippers to dunk, then attracted a crowd
on a drive before passing to an open Robert Horry for a three-point
basket.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' momentum fizzled and the Lakers pushed their lead to
88-73 after Bryant swished a three-pointer moments into the fourth
quarter. The Lakers were never threatened the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is it was a totally dominant performance by
Kobe," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "I thought he controlled the
game from start to finish. He got everybody involved. I guess all
that stuff about him being a selfish player was greatly exaggerated."</TE>
<TE>   Duly motivated by an Internet report that quoted Laker assistant
Tex Winter as saying Bryant was difficult to coach, Bryant soared
over and around the flat-footed Clippers. He also set up teammates
for easy baskets and went after rebounds with a passion normally
reserved for the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely had a lot of motivation to play this game," Bryant
said. "This is the style of basketball I want to play all season
long.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, it's a confidence boost for some of these guys, that
we can win some basketball games without Shaq [O'Neal]."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant playing at close to his best was but one critical element
that separated the Lakers from the Clippers on Friday. The Lakers'
devotion to a team game was another. The Clippers' willingness to
play like a bunch of guys playing pickup ball on their lunch break
was one more.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers moved without the ball, leaving Clipper defenders
trailing in their wake and scoring easy baskets. All too often, the
Clippers made one pass and took a hurried shot that missed the mark
with plenty of time left on the shot clock.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers built a 60-41 lead by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson had joked that the Lakers could go into a
funk without O'Neal, whose bum toe will sideline him for at least
another week or so.</TE>
<TE>   As ever, Jackson seemed to be on the mark after the Lakers shot
39% during belly flops Tuesday against the San Antonio Spurs and
Wednesday against the Portland Trail Blazers in their first two
games.</TE>
<TE>   Along came the Clippers and everything seemed right in the Lakers'
world.</TE>
<TE>   "They definitely played with that kind of intensity," Jackson said
of the Lakers' desire to halt their losing streak. "They knew it was
time to stop that leak."</TE>
<TE>   Now, it would seem the Clippers could be the ones headed toward an
0-7 start and a long, miserable season of trying to rejoin the
playoff race. The Clippers play the Detroit Pistons at Staples on
Sunday before heading on the road to Philadelphia, New Jersey,
Orlando and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry says the Clippers could use another month-long training
camp, the better to recover from an injury-riddled October that left
them unprepared for the rigors of what many believed would be the
best of their 19 seasons in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "We got off to such a terrible start," Gentry said. "We didn't
play well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really disappointing. Hopefully, it's not a trend. We've got
to find a way to start playing together. We're not clicking together.
We struggled to get into any rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers would draw within striking distance in the third
quarter. But with Elton Brand and Michael Olowokandi still getting
their games together after sitting out training camp because of knee
trouble, they couldn't overtake the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept.
26 and was scoreless against the Cavaliers in the opener Wednesday,
had 19 points and 12 rebounds in 40 minutes against the Lakers.
Olowokandi had 12 points and five rebounds in 36 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Miller led the Clippers with 22 points.</TE>

<HD>All's OK With Kobe and Tex</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Confronted Friday with a potentially divisive Internet story about
their relationship with each other, Laker assistant coach Tex Winter
said he once had the same debates with Michael Jordan, and Kobe
Bryant maintained, "I love [Tex]. He's my man."</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers generally are over the squabbling that coated the early
years of Phil Jackson's tenure, with Shaquille O'Neal and Bryant and
Jackson finding ways to live and play together.</LD>
<LD>   So, it was viewed with some surprise in Laker circles when an old
friend of Jackson's and Winter's wrote a grim article that quoted
Winter as saying Bryant was, among other things, "selfish" and
"uncoachable," descriptions that allowed the writer -- Charley Rosen
-- to muse on "Kobe's swollen ego."</LD>
<TE>   Rosen wrote Jackson's last book, "More Than a Game," was Jackson's
assistant with the Albany Patroons of the CBA, and as a freelance
columnist for ESPN.com has spent enough time in Los Angeles recently
to dine with Jackson and accept rides from Winter.</TE>
<TE>   A recent conversation with Winter apparently took place on the
drive home from the Lakers' season opener, a loss to the San Antonio
Spurs in which Bryant took 29 shots and missed 20.</TE>
<TE>   Winter, Godfather of the triangle offense and a rigorous defender
of it, had told Bryant, "You played stupidly." To which Bryant
replied, "You coached stupidly."</TE>
<TE>   The exchange was not a particularly unusual one, given, as Bryant
said, "He's bullheaded. I'm bullheaded."</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, Bryant said of the accusations of stupidity with a laugh,
"He did. And I did too."</TE>
<TE>   The shock for Bryant -- and Winter -- was reading about it three
days later.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had encounters like that before," Bryant said. "That's how
Tex and I are. We go way back. I have so much respect for him."</TE>
<TE>   Winter, 80, said he believed he had been venting in confidence,
and said Rosen picked critical words from their conversation and used
them out of the larger context.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant spoke at separate times with Winter and Jackson, and
everyone agreed to move on.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said that suspicions Rosen might have gotten his
criticisms from Jackson were unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that Charley is a novelist that ended up trying to write
some journalism, and it's not really journalism," Jackson said. "I
had nothing to do with that.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe and I have a great relationship. I don't want it to be
compromised."</TE>
<TE>   He suspected Bryant and Winter's wouldn't be either, revealing
that in the tumultuous times between Jackson and Bryant, "Tex was
always his strongest defender. They have a relationship that bounces
along at times."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers tentatively have targeted a Nov. 12 game against the
Atlanta Hawks for O'Neal's return.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who on Thursday night was cleared by his physician to
double his rehabilitation work, said only, "I don't know. It depends.
I'll be back very soon."</TE>

<LD>Phil's Lakers are ugly. Keeping marginal talents such as Fox, Fisher
and George just to instigate fights with the skilled players on the
Kings isn't coaching, it's thuggery. Add 400-pound crybaby Shaq, and
a bulked-up, trash-talking Kobe and yecch. Thank God for DirecTV and
the Kings.</LD>

<TE>   My Laker season ended 2:07 into the final preseason game against
Sacramento when Rick Fox added his name to the list of NBA playground
thugs. I turned the game off and plan not to turn the Lakers back on
until there is some indication that they care about the classy legacy
left to them by Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Kareem and Magic. If they
continue to resort to this unsportsmanlike style of play and
behavior, a fourth championship would stand for little.</TE>
<TE>   Vlade Divac rightly called Fox and Doug Christie "idiots."
Shaquille O'Neal, with typical lack of class, jokes about it, saying
his surgically repaired toe "feels pretty good. I had Doug Christie's
wife massage it for me." If O'Neal had a wife, he might view such a
comment quite differently.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think Phil Jackson's books have made a dent in the heads
of these Lakers.</TE>

<TE>   Without Shaq and Fox, the Lakers will start with a lousy record,
will lose home-court advantage, and will be knocked out of the
playoffs early on.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, wait. The Angels lost 14 of their first 20 games, and still
won the World Series. Maybe all isn't lost after all.</TE>

they are, tampering, and fines him accordingly.</TE>

<TE>   For business reasons I was in the Bay Area last weekend. After
Game 6, in which the Giants lost the 5-0 lead, I found myself
standing in a bar in San Francisco's Mission District, reassuring
completely crushed Giant fans: "That's the great thing about
baseball, there's always tomorrow!"</TE>
<TE>   But after Game 7, a big guy at Amante's on Green Street in North
Beach wearing an old "NY Giants" orange cap revealed the truth. "It
was a fait accompli" they'd lose the Series, he said. "We tossed it."
Ya gotta love how they talk up there. "Angels beat Giants," the big
guy continued. "You do the myth."</TE>

<TE>   My son and I went to Game 7 wearing Giant caps and shirts. When we
entered the stadium with our friends, the confrontation with Angel
fans started. We experienced verbal abuse from hostile fans and a
young man tripped me. During the game a fan kept throwing peanuts at
us. After a while security got involved so that we could enjoy the
game and eventually security escorted this abusive fan away.</TE>
<TE>   We thought that if we left early we could avoid any more abuse. As
we exited gate 3 we were quickly surrounded by what seemed like
thousands of screaming, jumping and intoxicated fans. They were
shadow boxing around us trying to get us to fight with them. We were
being pushed and obscenities were screamed at us. We feared for our
lives. I told my son to not say a word and to keep moving as quickly
as possible to get to our car. I decided that the smartest thing to
do for our safety was to remove our shirts and hats. We turned my
son's Giant jacket inside out and hid our shirts and hats inside it.
To have to walk the rest of the way to our car in fear was
devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout this whole incident we saw maybe a handful of security
officers standing by the stadium who did nothing to help us. We saw
no security guards in the parking lot. What was the Angel
organization thinking?</TE>
<TE>   It is a shame that we have to be afraid to attend one of America's
greatest sporting events of all time. Will we need to be afraid to
attend any championship game played in Los Angeles for the rest of
our lives?</TE>

<LD>Am I the only discontented Clipper fan who noticed the irony that
Diane Pucin's column, "Is This All They Have to Offer?" [Oct. 31],
which bemoaned the palpable lack of intensity exhibited by the
Clippers on opening night, was immediately followed by a quarter-page
Clipper ad with the banner "INTENSITY" defined as "extreme energy
exerted in thought, emotion or action." I guess this means the only
"INTENSITY" we will see will be displayed by the upcoming Clipper
opponents.</LD>
<LD>   Excellent ad placement, Donald. Was this call made by the same
marketing geniuses who came up with the motto, "Pure Basketball",
which is so simply satirized as "Poor Basketball"?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I just watched Tyler Ebell run for 160 yards and one touchdown, his
fourth 100-plus-yard game. The sports announcers couldn't say enough
about the performance of this prolific running back, yet it took
spring camp, fall training camp and a major tailback injury to get
Bob Toledo to play him.</LD>
<LD>   During the victory over Stanford, the Bruins threw only one pass
to tight end Mike Seidman, resulting in a touchdown. Seidman, a
projected top NFL draft pick, has been waiting four years for the
ball and has yet to get his number called consistently.</LD>
<LD>   Toledo is oblivious to the player combinations that could have
made this team -- and past teams -- a serious contender. Get rid of
him and hire a coach who knows what he has and what to do with it.</LD>

<TE>   The Stanford-UCLA game was a big upset. The Stanford coach
amazingly out-dumbed Bob Toledo. It is interesting to note that last
year's Stanford coach, Ty Willingham, outsmarted Toledo by leaving
Stanford knowing that the cupboard was bare. If Toledo was as smart
as Willingham, he would have left UCLA when Cade McNown finished his
career there.</TE>

being petty, but I don't think that's the right example for children
who might otherwise be inspired by Ebell's story and accomplishments.</TE>

<LD>You will undoubtedly hear voices of protest from many men whose
hackles were raised after reading of Martha Burk's plan to protest
next spring's Masters at Augusta. I too believe that Augusta has the
right to admit members of its own choosing. It is a private club. I
personally believe that the Masters is a grand old tradition played
on sacred ground.</LD>
<LD>   However, this is a free country and part of that freedom includes
the right to free expression -- Ms. Burk's included. However, as a
woman, I would suggest that our protesting efforts should concentrate
on much more critical matters such as those related to the health and
safety of all Americans. Let the privileged few at Augusta retain
their rights as a private club. As for me, I'll protest for health
care, education, unpolluted rivers and clean air.</LD>

order, she can set her sights on the abolition of the red tees. After
all, equality is equality.</TE>

Autzen Stadium surrounded by a sea of green Oregon fans.</LD>

<HD>Starr Can't Sell, but He Can Sail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FONTANA</DL>
<LD>David Starr may lament his inability to sell sponsorships, admitting
"I'm not a closer," but the NASCAR Craftsman Truck driver from
Houston hopes to close the show today at California Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Starr, 35, won the pole Friday for the American Racing Wheels 200,
and is trying to win his second race in a row after a 65-race
drought.</LD>
<LD>   His Spears Motorsports Chevrolet, owned by Wayne Spears, will
start alongside Coy Gibbs, son of former NFL coach and Winston Cup
team owner Joe Gibbs, making it an all-Chevy front row leading the
37-car field. Starr went around the two-mile D-shaped oval in 40.944
seconds, averaging 175.850 mph. Gibbs was .004 of a second behind,
averaging 175.824 mph.</LD>
<TE>   Starr also started on the pole Oct. 13 in Las Vegas, site of his
first victory. At California Speedway, starting on the pole may be a
boost to driver confidence and team morale -- and the sponsors like
it -- but it's not that important.</TE>
<TE>   "Qualifying is overrated at times," Starr said. "The main thing is
to get a solid starting spot in the field. It doesn't matter where
you start in this field, it's where you finish.... A lot of people
put a lot of emphasis on that one good lap, and sometimes I think
it's overemphasized, and when it comes to race time, you're lost
during the race. When I think of a solid starting spot, I think top
10, nine, eight."</TE>
<TE>   Starr is used to finishing in the top 10. He has 15 top-10
finishes and eight top-five finishes this season. He is fourth in the
championship, 169 points behind leader Mike Bliss, who starts fourth
in a Chevy, on the outside of rookie Bill Lester in a Dodge.</TE>
<TE>   Starr seems to have a knack for this. He raced only five times
last season for two owners, but finished in the top five in three of
those races, and in the top 10 in another. Spears, his current owner,
noticed what he was doing with a skeleton crew.</TE>
<TE>   "When we finished [fifth] here last year, Wayne Spears was waiting
at my truck," Starr said. "It's amazing to go from one of the most
underfunded teams to one of the most well-funded.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, if I wanted to continue to race I had to be a
salesman. It's nice to know that this year, all I have to focus on is
the racing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The truck series announced its 2003 schedule, and it will have 25
races, beginning at Daytona on Feb. 14 and ending Nov. 14 at
Homestead-Miami Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe's Motor Speedway will be on the schedule for the first time,
on May 16. Martinsville will have a second race, which increases to
12 the number of races held in conjunction with Winston Cup, Busch
Series or Grand National events. The series, which began in 1995,
returns to one of its charter tracks, the half-mile Mesa Marin
Raceway in Bakersfield on March 23. The trucks raced at Mesa Marin in
2001 but not this season. The series returns to California Speedway
on Sept. 20 as a support race for the Indy Racing League.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Hemphill crashed in Turn 2 near the end of Happy Hour and
suffered minor head and neck injuries. He was taken to Loma Linda
University Medical Center and was responsive and alert. He qualified
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alex Tagliani, Jimmy Vasser and Tony Kanaan were the three fastest
drivers during Friday's practice sessions for Championship Auto
Racing Teams' Toyota 500. Tagliani, last year's pole winner at
228.727 mph, averaged 233.726 mph in the afternoon session, almost
five mph faster than his pole speed a year ago of 228.727.</TE>
<TE>   Vasser was second-fastest in the afternoon session, and Kanaan was
fastest in the morning session at 232.891 mph, a shade quicker than
Dario Franchitti.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Fernandez, the only owner-driver in CART, announced he is
returning to the series through 2004. That much had been expected
because of Fernandez's heritage, his Mexican sponsors and CART's
popularity in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300,000 are expected to attend the Mexico Gran Premio on
Nov. 17 in Mexico City. "I'm not going to sit here and say that
everything is perfect at the moment [in CART], but the series is on
the mend and on the upswing," Fernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez is trying to rehabilitate his fractured vertebra in time
to race in Mexico City. He was injured last week at Surfer's Paradise
when Tora Takagi's car landed on top of his in a first-lap accident
involving nine of the 18 cars. Fernandez, 14th in the championship,
is being replaced this weekend by Max Papis for the second time; he
also was the replacement when Fernandez missed the race at Mid-Ohio
with a fractured pelvis.</TE>
<TE>   Papis, who finished second to Fernandez in the 1999 race and
second to Cristiano da Matta last season, was eighth in afternoon
practice, 12th overall. Fernandez is also expected to run a car
driven by Shinji Nakano in the Indy Racing League.</TE>

<HD>Garnett Stops McGrady in Timberwolves' Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Garnett recorded his seventh career triple-double and shut down
Tracy McGrady.</LD>
<LD>   Garnett had 23 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists as the Minnesota
Timberwolves handed the Orlando Magic its first loss of the season,
111-105, Friday night at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Guarded mostly by Garnett, McGrady struggled with his shooting
touch all night. McGrady, who scored 31 and 24 points in Orlando's
first two games -- victories over Philadelphia and Miami -- went six
for 15 for 18 points, 14 in the second half.</LD>
<TE>   "That's the best I've ever been defended," McGrady said. "Ever."</TE>
<TE>   Garnett's long 7-foot frame forced Orlando's leading scorer to
alter his shots several times.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great team defense," Garnett said. "I just tried to keep a
hand in his face."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 102, Indiana 91 -- In their first meeting since the
Nets' double-overtime win in the deciding Game 5 of the first round
of last season's playoffs, New Jersey defeated Indiana at East
Rutherford, N.J., in a game that included the ejection of three
players, including Jason Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jefferson led five Nets in double figures with 19 points.
Dikembe Mutombo had 14, Kenyon Martin and Rodney Rogers had 11 and
Lucious Harris had 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 98, New York 86 -- Allen Iverson scored 35 points
despite another poor shooting performance and the 76ers overcame a
17-point third-quarter deficit at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, who missed 17 of 23 shots in the first three quarters,
made his first six shots of the fourth quarter and finished 12 for
30. The three-time NBA scoring champion had 15 points in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 91, Toronto 72 -- Tim Duncan had 22 points and 15
rebounds and the Spurs held the Raptors to an NBA record-tying six
points in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The six points were a franchise low and tied the NBA record for
fewest points in a fourth quarter set three times, most recently by
Memphis against Phoenix last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston 83, Denver 74 -- Cuttino Mobley scored 12 of his 29 points
in the fourth quarter and Yao Ming had his first NBA basket as the
Rockets won at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Yao, who was scoreless in his debut Wednesday, entered with 3:44
left in the first quarter. Yao got his first points with an 11-foot
turnaround jumper with 10:41 left in the second. He finished with two
points and seven rebounds in 13 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 84, New Orleans 79 -- Jalen Rose scored 21 points and
Donyell Marshall had 15 points and 12 rebounds at Chicago. It's the
first time since 1996-97 that the Bulls have won their first two
games, and they're above .500 for the first time since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 78, Cleveland 74 -- Shawn Marion had 21 points and 16
rebounds as the Suns overcame an awful shooting night to win at
Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 109, Memphis 86 -- Richard Hamilton scored 23 points and
Chauncey Billups had 15 to lead the Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 106, Golden State 93 -- Gary Payton had 26 points and 10
assists to lead the SuperSonics at Oakland.</TE>

<TE>   Wally Szczerbiak agreed to a six-year, $63-million contract
extension with the Timberwolves that could keep him in Minnesota
through the 2008-09 season.... NBA owners approved an agreement with

<LD>It's a bad season in which nothing good happens for anyone but this
one wasn't working out so well around here, where the local teams
went three games before anyone won and then, let's face it, only
after they played each other.</LD>
<LD>   And the lucky club is ... the Lakers?</LD>
<LD>   Yes, by a 108-93 score, your three-time defending NBA champions
finally got into the win column Friday night, just as Coach Phil
Jackson said they would. Well, sooner or later.</LD>
<TE>   Or as he put it before the game:</TE>
<TE>   "We think we're going to win a game or two here, somewhere along
the line."</TE>
<TE>   This may seem like a modest prediction, but anyone who saw
Tuesday's opening loss to the Spurs might have wondered if they'd win
before Thanksgiving, or at least before Shaquille O'Neal returned.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, himself, had been joking (or not) about starting 0-7, 1-6
or 2-5. With Sacramento off to a fast start, without Mike Bibby and
Chris Webber, this might have meant the Lakers could have found
themselves five, six or seven games out of first place.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Alvin Gentry would kill for Phil Jackson's problems.</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper coach has a roster full of upcoming free agents who
were knocked off their heretofore-optimistic stride when owner Donald
T. Sterling refrained from re-signing any of them this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation that it might get into their young heads was hardly
refuted by their opener, which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers,
a feat thought impossible beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   As former Raider Coach Tom Flores once said, it's still early but
it's getting late ... fast. The Clippers have to win some games soon,
to begin to generate some positive momentum before their contract
situation eats them up and Gentry knows it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we almost have to," he said before the game. "Obviously,
as a consequence of what's going on, we need to keep it real positive
here so all of a sudden, we don't have any fragmentation.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I think it's going to be easy to fragment if guys start
thinking about individual things, rather than team goals. I think we
need to try to find a way to get off to a positive start."</TE>
<TE>   They're still looking.</TE>
<TE>   On top of everything, the Clippers barely had a preseason, with
three starters, Elton Brand, Michael Olowokandi and Quentin
Richardson, hurt and missing most of it.</TE>
<TE>   Now everyone's on their feet, sort of, and playing, as best they
can.</TE>
<TE>   Playing together, which is important if they're ever going to
defend anybody (so far, they're giving up 103 a game), remains a
problem, however.</TE>
<TE>   "We just got off to such a bad start," said Gentry afterward. "
...Hopefully, it's not a trend starting here, but we've got to find a
way to get everybody on the same page, to start playing together."</TE>
<TE>   And on top of all that, there was the Laker controversy du jour,
with Tex Winter calling Kobe Bryant selfish, untrue to the triangle,
etc., in ESPN.com., or in other words, much of the same stuff Tex
used to tell Michael Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant is actually a changed young man. You could tell from the
opener in which he took 29 shots, missed 20 ... and later apologized
for shooting so often.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, if anyone had asked him about taking 29 shots, he'd
have said, "So?"</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, however, the Lakers have a peculiar situation on
their hands, with O'Neal and Rick Fox out. To whom do you want Bryant
to throw the ball, one of the Samaki twins, Samaki Walker or Soumaila
Samake?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Winter is an equal-opportunity acerbic, who also
sometimes tells the laid-back Jackson it's time to uncross his legs
and start coaching, so no one in Lakerdom got too excited. The net
result of this was to fire up Bryant even more than he usually is.
After explaining he had no problem with Tex, etc., he went out and
did a major destructo on Corey Maggette, Quentin Richardson and every
other Clipper who got close to him.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line, it was just a totally dominating performance by
Kobe," said Gentry. "I just think he controlled the game from start
to finish."</TE>
<TE>   Given the depth of Bryant's passion and that of the Clippers'
funk, it was a bigger mismatch than usual. Kobe had 12 points, nine
rebounds and five assists in the first quarter, which projects to
48-36-20 over a full game, but settled for 33-15-12.</TE>
<TE>   Good thing he's not more coachable, or he'd really be something.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe Gentry should hire Tex and have him talk to his players,
or to Donald T. Sterling. In Clipperdom, it's already crunch time.</TE>

<LD>Remember 1998?</LD>
<LD>   In some ways, it doesn't seem that long ago that John Elway was
putting the finishing touches on his storied NFL career. Then again,
if you're browsing the list of the league's current starting
quarterbacks, those Elway days seem as old as the Dead Sea Scrolls.</LD>
<LD>   Just two weeks ago, the roster of starting quarterbacks included
Michael Vick, Chris Redman, Chris Weinke, Quincy Carter, Joey
Harrington, David Carr, Ray Lucas, Chad Pennington, Tommy Maddox,
Marc Bulger, Drew Brees and Patrick Ramsey.</LD>
<TE>   In a word: Who?</TE>
<TE>   Consider this:</TE>
<TE>   * The season is only halfway over, and 15 teams have turned to at
least two quarterbacks as starters. Washington, Cincinnati, Carolina
and St. Louis have rotated in at least three starters.</TE>
<TE>   * Only four teams have starting quarterbacks who predate 1998 in
their current roles: Jacksonville (Mark Brunell), Tennessee (Steve
McNair), Green Bay (Brett Favre) and Arizona (Jake Plummer).</TE>
<TE>   * Fourteen teams -- less than half the league -- are starting
quarterbacks who have been on the job longer than 1 1/2 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The situation even baffles former San Francisco 49er Coach Bill
Walsh, the league's preeminent quarterback guru.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't explain why, but there needed to be a changing of the
guard in recent years," Walsh said. "We were all wondering where all
the quarterbacks went, just a year ago. I kept saying that the
colleges are developing far more quarterbacks than ever, because all
the colleges and high schools are throwing the ball now.</TE>
<TE>   "Virtually every school throws it 30 or 40 times a game, so you're
bound to develop good quarterbacks. There isn't any way to avoid it."</TE>
<TE>   Walsh said several new starters in the current crop have caught
his eye, particularly San Diego's Brees, Detroit's Harrington and
Pennington of the New York Jets. But Atlanta's Vick is in a class of
his own, Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came out of college, I wasn't sure he could really do it.
I thought he was too inconsistent a passer," he said. "I wasn't sure
if he was accurate enough, but it appears he is. He's a sensation.
You have to deal with him differently."</TE>
<TE>   The way Walsh sees it, good cornerbacks are in short supply, in
part because "the glamour is out of the position" in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of high school players who would make good corners would
rather concentrate on playing running back," he said. "And when they
get to college, they don't want to be tackling big fullbacks when
they could be carrying the ball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Personnel Approach</TE>
<TE>   They were high school rivals at Loyola and Crespi, football
teammates -- and roommates -- at UCLA, and now George Paton and Sean
Howard will square off on national TV.</TE>
<TE>   Well, sort of.</TE>
<TE>   Paton, 33, is director of pro personnel for the Miami Dolphins,
who play Monday night at Green Bay, where Howard, 33, is assistant
director of pro personnel. They are two of the up-and-coming
executives who could wind up as NFL general managers within a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Both spend extensive time on the road scouting opponents and
keeping tabs on every available player, from those cut by an NFL team
to hopefuls from NFL Europe, Canadian Football League and the Arena
Football League. They have both negotiated player contracts too, a
process that allows Howard to make use of his University of Oregon
law degree.</TE>
<TE>   On a typical Sunday, Howard might be in New Orleans preparing a
report on the Saints and making note of every nuance that doesn't
necessarily show up on tape. He'll keep a detailed account of just
about everything, whispering notes into his tape recorder.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll spend a lot of time just watching what's happening on the
sidelines," said Howard, a former Bruin linebacker who began his NFL
career as a scout with the 49ers in 1999. "I'm looking to see if a
guy's moving around gingerly on an ankle, or how a team runs
personnel packages out on the field, or when do they break the
huddle? How much time's left on the clock when they're snapping the
ball? Tempo is huge."</TE>
<TE>   Each Monday, Paton turns in a 50-page report on the upcoming
opponent, a study that includes a detailed breakdown on all 53
players. He comes up with a list of "game tips" and presents them
before the entire team when the Dolphins start their week.</TE>
<TE>   "An offensive lineman will ask about a defensive end: What are his
favorite moves? What are his weaknesses?" said Rick Spielman, Miami's
vice president of football operations. "George has to know all
aspects from a personnel standpoint. You can't fake it with these
guys. Once you lie, you're going to lose your reputation."</TE>
<TE>   Spielman brought Paton from the Chicago Bears, where they worked
together under then-Bear coach Dave Wannstedt, now coach of the
Dolphins. This is Paton's sixth season in the NFL. He played some
low-profile professional football in Italy and Austria before working
in computer sales, then as an assistant coach at Loyola.</TE>
<TE>   Now, his workdays start at 5:30 a.m. and end around 10 p.m. He
rarely sees a Dolphin game because he spends all his time during the
season scouting the next week's opponent. Always within reach are his
tape recorder, laptop and an inch-thick spreadsheet with the
particulars of every available player, in case the Dolphins need to
fill a roster spot in a pinch. During the week, he's an answer man
ready to give any tips on the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just another opinion," he said. "But if it helps one guy,
it's worth it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don't Look Now, Chucky</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jon Gruden has a reputation as an offensive guru, but it's
hard to ignore Tampa Bay's numbers through the first eight games. The
Buccaneer offense has scored 11 touchdowns and 121 points. By this
point last season, coordinator Clyde Christensen's offense had 16
touchdowns and 145 points. A year earlier, under coordinator Les
Steckel, the Buccaneer offense had 19 touchdowns and 175 points
through eight games. And, in 1999, Mike Shula's last season as
coordinator, the offense had 12 touchdowns and 122 points.</TE>
<TE>   That means this season's offense is at a four-year low.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the team is 6-2 and winning with defense -- a defense, mind
you, that has scored five touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   It should be noted the Buccaneers have an ancient offensive line,
one that can't establish a ground attack and provides minimal
protection for Tampa Bay's quarterbacks, growing more black and blue
by the minute.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST -- Four of the last five meetings between the Patriots
and Bills have been decided in overtime, and the last eight games of
the series have been decided by 10 points or fewer. In two games
against New England last season, the Bills collected 12 sacks -- four
by defensive end Aaron Schobel.... An awkward footnote on Cris Carter
signing with the Dolphins: His new position coach learned the news by
watching TV. "It came across the teletype on ESPN," receivers coach
Robert Ford said. "Dedric Ward tapped me on the shoulder and asked me
if Cris was coming. At the time I didn't know and I told [the
receivers] no. But they looked at me like I was crazy. It hit like
that. If there was a sour point about this, that probably was it."</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH -- Cal Ripken will always be Baltimore's iron man, but
Raven tackle Jonathan Ogden isn't exactly scrap metal. The
first-round pick out of UCLA has started every game (109) since the
Ravens made their debut in 1996.... In the four games since Maddox
took over as quarterback, the Steelers have scored at least 28
points. Maddox got the starting job after taking over for Kordell
Stewart in the fourth quarter of a Sept. 29 game against Cleveland,
and rallying the Steelers to a 15-12 overtime victory.</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH -- Tennessee has blown leads in three of four losses,
has beaten only one team with a winning record and barely escaped a
humiliating loss to Cincinnati. So, it stands in the ridiculously bad
AFC South, where the 3-4 Titans are playing for first place this week
against 4-3 Indianapolis. "This is not where we dreamed about being
at the beginning of the season," defensive tackle John Thornton said.
"But we'll take it the way it is now. Now we have a chance to get to
.500 against a team in first place. It's going to count as two
games." Now would you pay to see that?</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST -- Not only will Jerry Rice play a regular-season game
against his former team for the first time, but he has a chance to
reach some more milestones. He needs one touchdown to become the
first player in NFL history to score 200, and he needs 10 yards to
become the first player with 21,000 yards receiving.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST -- No doubt Emmitt Smith's all-time rushing record will
be broken one day, but chances are it won't be eclipsed by a running
back who has spent his career with one team -- as Smith has, and
Walter Payton did. It also could get much tougher to accomplish, and
not just because players are getting bigger, stronger and faster.
"The reason is you can't afford to keep your players together for a
long time," said Floyd Reese, general manager of the Tennessee
Titans. "In other words, a great back with a chance to break Emmitt's
rushing record won't have a bunch of Pro Bowl offensive linemen and
million-dollar tight ends and receivers together for a long time.
That supporting cast won't be kept together to help them keep having
great seasons and be in position to break records." ... Chad
Hutchinson, who made his debut as a Cowboy starter last Sunday, is
the only quarterback in league history who also has pitched in the
major leagues. He spent four innings on the mound for the St. Louis
Cardinals in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH -- Detroit defensive end Robert Porcher, who played with
Barry Sanders from 1992 through '98, has an interesting theory about
why Sanders walked away from football when he was so close to
breaking Payton's rushing record. It's an enduring mystery. Sanders
retired on the eve of training camp in 1999. He had 15,269 yards in
10 seasons and, barring injury, would have broken the record in
another season or two. Porcher told the Detroit News he believes
Sanders left the game so he would forever be linked to the rushing
record. "Sooner or later, whether it's 15 or 20 years from now,
somebody will come along and break [the record that now belongs to
Smith]," Porcher said. "Emmitt will just be the second-leading
rusher. Then, when it's broken again, he'll just be third. He'll go
down.... But Barry will always be linked to whoever has the record.
And I told him that. He just gave me a sly smile."</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH -- Not only is Atlanta's Vick the only quarterback since
the 1970 merger to rush for at least 90 yards in consecutive games,
but he's the league's only starting quarterback who has yet to throw
an interception this season. He has thrown 135 passes without being
picked off. Falcon cornerback Ray Buchanan on Vick: "There he goes,
spraying on that invisible juice. Now you see him, now you don't."
... Carolina's Steve Smith fumbled away a punt return in the fourth
quarter of a 12-9 loss to Tampa Bay last Sunday. This, after Smith
taunted Buccaneer players for much of the game by yelling, "Is that
all you got? Is that all you got?" The outbursts prompted a response
from Warren Sapp, not the most reserved, understated player in the
league. "Steve Smith is a lovely returner," Sapp said. "He just has
to realize there are 11 guys hunting for him, and the more you talk
the worse it gets. You have to learn that. I had to learn that. Shut
up for a minute -- they might forget you're out there."</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST -- San Francisco receiver Terrell Owens is boycotting the
local media and hasn't spoken to Bay Area reporters in two weeks.
That must come as some relief to the 49ers this week, considering
they're playing the Raiders, and Owens has popped off about Tim Brown
in the past. Seems Owens doesn't appreciate Brown bashing his
star-dancing, football-signing antics.... The 49er-Raider game brings
to mind some memorable moments -- Raider assistant coach Charlie
Sumner punching 49er assistant Sam Wyche after a 1981 exhibition
game; Howie Long chasing 49er offensive line coach Bobb McKittrick
down an L.A. Coliseum tunnel because McKittrick's players were leg
whipping; and 49er defensive lineman Charles Haley going berserk
after a game, a tirade that ended only when Ronnie Lott -- then a
Raider -- stopped by his old locker room to calm him.</TE>

<HD>Vikings Finally Sign McKinnie to Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First-round draft pick Bryant McKinnie ended his 98-day holdout
Friday, agreeing to a five-year, $13.3 million contract with the
Minnesota Vikings that includes a $9.35 million signing bonus.</LD>
<LD>   The All-American offensive tackle from Miami was the No. 7 pick in
April. He became the only unsigned first-rounder when defensive
tackle Wendell Bryant, the 12th overall pick, signed with the Arizona
Cardinals on Sept. 12.</LD>
<LD>   The Vikings had until Nov. 12 to sign McKinnie -- otherwise he
would have been ineligible to play this season.</LD>
<TE>   McKinnie, who will be paid for the entire 2002 season despite
missing half of it, left for Minnesota on Friday and will sign the
contract today. He'll be at practice on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm elated with this contract," he said. "I know this has taken
some time, but ... I can't begin to tell you how excited I am to put
on a Vikings uniform. I feel like my dream is just about to begin. I
can't wait to play in my first game."</TE>
<TE>   Agents Ben Dogra and Jim Steiner turned down what the Vikings
declared a final offer on Aug. 1, a five-year, $13.1 million contract
that included an $8.1 million signing bonus. The No. 8 pick, Dallas
safety Roy Williams, got a bonus of $9.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The deal includes performance incentives that could push the value
to $13.5 million. The bonus will not be due immediately.</TE>
<TE>   McKinnie didn't allow a sack in college or high school. He won the
Outland Trophy last season as college football's best lineman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis Colt running back Edgerrin James will miss Sunday's
game against the Tennessee Titans because of a partially torn right
hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   James was downgraded from doubtful. He was injured in last
Sunday's loss at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Williams, an undrafted rookie from Texas Tech, could replace
James in a game the Colts must win to maintain their lead in the AFC
South.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington Redskin running back Stephen Davis missed practice
again because of a sprained knee and remains doubtful for Sunday's
game against the Seattle Seahawks.... Punter Tom Rouen signed with
the New York Giants. Rouen was released on Tuesday when Denver signed
Micah Knorr.... The Philadelphia Eagles put former USC safety Rashard
Cook on injured reserve and promoted Julian Jones from the practice
squad. Cook had missed three of the last four games because of a knee
injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston Texan defensive tackle Gary Walker was fined $15,000 by
the NFL for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Jacksonville quarterback Mark
Brunell.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt like I was making an aggressive football play, you
know, tackling the quarterback," Walker said. "I know I didn't do
[anything) intentional. I even talked to Mark after the game and I
didn't feel like it was intentional."</TE>

                           move chains at Seattle. (30)
25    N.Y. GIANTS (3-4)    With Ike Hilliard out, 17th-ranked Giant

26    CAROLINA (3-5)       Panthers lead the NFL with 31 sacks, 27 by
                           defensive line. (26)

                           that won't help hobbled Jim Miller. (19)
30    HOUSTON (2-5)        David Carr, the human bruise, has been

31    N.Y. JETS (2-5)      Chad Pennington's first road start at San
                           Diego. (28)

<HD>A Little Giant Behind Wheel</HD>
<DH>Danny Oakes, the king of West Coast midget racing in 1940s,
is still light on his feet and looking sharp at 91</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the summer of 1946, the Dodgers were in Brooklyn, the Angels were
in the Pacific Coast League, the Rams were preparing for their first
Los Angeles exhibition game and Primo Carnera was wrestling at the
Olympic.</LD>
<LD>   The hottest ticket in town? The mighty midgets, race cars in
miniature.</LD>
<LD>   In one week in August, the noisy little thunderbugs drew 65,000 in
the Rose Bowl on a Tuesday night, 17,000 at Gilmore Stadium on
Thursday night and 65,128 in the Coliseum on Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   Danny Oakes, Dapper Dan to his legion of fans, was one of the
mightiest of the midget drivers. He was second that week at both
Gilmore and the Rose Bowl, but had already won the 1945 Turkey Night
Midget Grand Prix. And in 1947, he was to become the dominant midget
car driver on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Dapper Dan is still dapper. Not on the race tracks -- he is 91,
after all -- but on the dance floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked being called Dapper," said Oakes, who once wore silk
shirts and pressed white trousers while driving Johnny Balch's blue
and white midget at Gilmore. On one occasion, the team showed up in
knickers.</TE>
<TE>   His eyesight is failing, but as he says, a twinkle in his eye,
about his weekly dancing at Golden Sails in Long Beach, "I've been
jitterbugging since the days at the old Palomar and the Palladium. I
might not be able to see 'em like I used to, but I can still feel
'em." Oakes is believed to be the only living driver from the era of
Legion Ascot Speedway, the "Home of the Grim Reaper," as John Lucero
labeled it in his book, "Legion Ascot Speedway."</TE>
<TE>   "I started driving [full-sized roadsters] at the old Legion Ascot
sometime in 1932 and I raced there until the place closed," Oakes
recalled. "I lived in Santa Barbara and John Gibson, a friend of mine
there, put together a Model T chassis and said if we could get a
motor, we could go racing at Ascot. That was a long ways from Santa
Barbara but I liked the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We built a Ford flathead with a Winfield head and off we went. I
never drove with the big boys at Legion Ascot, I never got past the
consies [consolation races]. Most of the time I was a tail-ender in
them."</TE>
<TE>   At Ascot, where the big, lumbering roadsters raced over a
pock-marked, five-eighths-mile high-banked dirt oval, all Oakes wore
for head protection was a cloth helmet under his goggles.</TE>
<TE>   As old-time driver Peter DePaolo once said, "The only value of a
cloth helmet was that when you went by the pits, if you were
bleeding, the crew could see it."</TE>
<TE>   Drivers were so macho that when Wilbur Shaw -- later a three-time
Indy 500 winner -- wore a helmet for the first time at Legion Ascot,
he was roundly booed by spectators and called "chicken" by his fellow
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   There were no roll bars, much less roll cages, as midgets and
sprint cars have today.</TE>
<TE>   "If you flipped, you were likely a goner at Ascot," Oakes said.
"To tell you the truth, I never thought I'd live to see 50. Now look
at me.</TE>
<TE>   "Worst accident I had there was when the right rear wheel came off
on an old Model T Ford and the axle dug in the dirt. The car did a
three-quarter spin, but didn't tip over. Mighty lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Ascot was closed in 1936 and it was a year or two before Oakes was
back in a race car.</TE>
<TE>   "Midgets were just getting hot, but I'd never driven anything but
big roadsters," he said. "I got the itch when I heard an
[Offenhauser] engine for the first time. I thought, 'What the hell is
that?' I tell you, that Offy was a great engine."</TE>
<TE>   Oakes and a cousin pieced together a midget in Santa Barbara and
Oakes drove it for the first time on the horse track at Pomona. Then
they decided to tackle Gilmore Stadium, already secure in its
reputation as the nation's premier midget car track.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore Stadium was a half-mile dirt track built specifically for
midget racing, although it also was used for football games. A
Thursday night tradition was 18,000 fans filling the stadium for
midgets.</TE>
<TE>   "In those days, if you drove a midget you could keep busy and earn
a good living," Oakes said. "There were races nearly every night. We
would run at Long Beach, Atlantic, Santa Maria, Huntington Beach and
sometimes Balboa in San Diego. That was a long haul from Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "But Gilmore was the ultimate. It was always the best kept track
in the country. The only one that compared with it was 16th Street
Speedway in Indianapolis, across the street from the big track. All
the hotdogs in the country raced there, because it was close to
Indy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Biggest Win</TE>
<TE>   Winning the 1945 Turkey Night race was the most prestigious
accomplishment of Oakes' career, although at the time he didn't think
it was that big. It was the first major race after World War II,
though, and Gilmore and all the other tracks had been closed from
1942 through 1944.</TE>
<TE>   All the equipment was old. Even the race tires had been sitting in
garages for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a lot of notoriety out of that win," Oakes said. "More
today than I got back then.</TE>
<TE>   "I started seventh or eighth -- I had a red-hot machine. Our
biggest worry was if the tires would last, so they only ran 75 laps
that year. I ran fourth for a long time. I kept pouring it on, making
sure I didn't do anything stupid, until the only guy ahead of me was
Perry Grimm.</TE>
<TE>   "With five laps to go, I caught him, but I thought it was the
next-to-last lap. I didn't have any pit signs so I tried to watch
Perry's but I couldn't focus fast enough when I went by the pits.
After I passed him, I thought, 'Finish another lap and I've got it
made.' Only they never dropped the white flag [signifying one more
lap], so I just kept on going. I had no idea where I was until I saw
the white [flag] a couple of laps later and I knew I had it.</TE>
<TE>   "Grimm told me afterward that the crew kept saying, 'He's coming!
He's coming!' but [he] couldn't do a damn thing about it."</TE>
<TE>   Oakes finished fifth in 1946 and 1947 and fourth in 1955, just
ahead of Rodger Ward, in other Turkey Night races.</TE>
<TE>   He was also at Irwindale Speedway two years ago when past winners
were honored. Oakes was the oldest.</TE>
<TE>   "That Irwindale, now that's a pretty place," he said. "That's the
nicest half-mile track in the country. I'd sure like to have raced at
a place like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Best Race</TE>
<TE>   Oakes won perhaps 100 other races around the country, but says his
best race was a 100-lap main event in the Rose Bowl in November 1946.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fast qualifier in a 16-car race and they made me start last
in an inverted start," Oakes said. "I raised hell about putting the
fast cars in the back, but the promoter said the public liked it that
way. When I said, 'This is not right,' he said, 'Run it or park it.'
So I ran it.</TE>
<TE>   "Duke Nalon -- he was one of the fastest guys on pavement -- was
next to me. He had qualified second. About halfway, Nalon and I were
10th or 11th. We kept passing one another when we were moving up. It
must have been a hell of a show.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed that all the front guys were driving the pole groove,
down on the inside. Nalon was down there too, so I decided if I was
going to win, I had to drive up right against the fence. I got half
the field in one lap and Duke moved right up behind me. It must have
been something to watch, two guys going around the pack on the
outside. We were taking chances, coming off the corner, but we were
not going to back off."</TE>
<TE>   Norman Holtkamp had led most of the race, and when he saw Oakes'
wheel out of the corner of his eye, he couldn't believe it.</TE>
<TE>   "You scared the hell out of me when I saw that wheel," he told
Oakes later. "I couldn't figure out what in the hell you were doing
on that side of me."</TE>
<TE>   Oakes won and Nalon was second.</TE>
<TE>   "Nalon always thought he was the best and he talked the same way,"
Oakes said. "One night I heard him telling the story about that race,
only in his version he put himself in the lead. 'The whole crowd was
behind us, I think Danny Oakes was right behind me,' he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't care if Nalon took the credit. I had the money in my
pocket and I knew I had driven the hardest and taken the most chances
on the high groove. It was my greatest race."</TE>
<TE>   There were other nights when things didn't turn out so well. Oakes
estimates he had about 20 racing accidents, some serious, some not,
but in those days they were all scary.</TE>
<TE>   One night at Orange Show Speedway in San Bernardino, Oakes' car
flipped end over end about five times, then hit a steel pole and
landed upside down in the middle of the track.</TE>
<TE>   "One driver said, 'That's the end of Danny Oakes,' " Oakes
recalled. "Guys getting killed happened quite a lot back then and he
was sure my time had come. When he started toward the wreck, he said
he damn near fainted when I started to crawl out. He said at first he
thought it was a ghost."</TE>
<TE>   Oakes suffered a broken collarbone and ribs, but managed to walk
back to the pits while the crowd went crazy at the sight of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you what saved me," he said. "I hunkered down in my
seat and hugged the steering wheel. I'd seen guys do endos and their
arms would fly out and the car would land on them. I just wrapped
myself around the wheel. That's what saved me, I think."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No-Win Situation</TE>
<TE>   On July 1, 1947, a 500-lap race was scheduled in the Coliseum on a
third-mile track. With 28 cars, it was a scorer's nightmare. For
nearly three hours, the little cars were spinning around inside the
huge stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Oakes says he won it. Officials, however, ruled Johnnie Parsons
the winner. Then four days later, Duane Carter was awarded the
victory -- over protests by Oakes' car owners, Balch and actress
Carole Landis.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea where they got Carter from," Oakes said. "He was
never in front of me, he never passed me.</TE>
<TE>   "Gordon Betz, the AAA official [AAA was the sanctioning body],
claimed we made two pit stops but we only made one. We had a
24-gallon tank in the tail that Luigi Lesovsky had made special for
us. Some officials said Parsons won, but he told Betz that we had
passed him and he never got back by us.</TE>
<TE>   "Then Betz announced four days later that Carter was the winner."</TE>
<TE>   Oakes was placed seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Oakes, who later became a prominent racing mechanic, tried three
times to qualify for the Indy 500. In 1954, in Balch's roadster, he
qualified 19th on the first day, but was bumped on the final day.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have made it, but Balch hired a lousy mechanic named
Willie -- I forgot his last name," Oakes said. "We should have been
at least 16th [in qualifying] and we wouldn't have been bumped.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Willie, 'This thing lost 500 rpm,' and he was a smart ...
and said, 'You know where that 500 rpm is. It's right there in your
foot.' "</TE>
<TE>   Because he was a careful, calculating driver who followed Richard
Petty's mantra, "I want to win driving as slow as I can," Oakes was
often called "Balloon Foot."</TE>
<TE>   "I always told guys who called me that that you don't win races
the way I did with a balloon foot, and that I had the prize money in
my hip pocket to prove it."</TE>
<TE>   The money in that hip pocket has allowed him to live the last 23
years in Huntington Landmark, a retirement community in Huntington
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "The nicest thing about this place is, it's close to the dance
halls," Oakes said.</TE>

<HD>Scoring Systems Will Create Some Confusion</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Still seeking judging and scoring systems that will restore the
credibility figure skating lost during the Salt Lake City judging
scandal, the International Skating Union is trying two experiments
this weekend at Skate Canada, the second competition in the six-event
Grand Prix series.</LD>
<LD>   The interim judging system -- 10 judges evaluate skaters'
performances but a computer randomly chooses seven marks that count
-- was used at Skate America last weekend and is being used again at
Skate Canada in Quebec City. Skate Canada, however, is also testing a
system in which skaters accumulate points based on the elements they
perform.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a very confusing year," said Phyllis Howard, president of
the U.S. Figure Skating Assn."It's really a transition year. It
remains to be seen how these new systems will work, and they're still
being tested. They're very different, and it will take time for
people to adjust."</LD>
<TE>   Under the interim judging system, skaters are marked on the basis
of the traditional 6.0 perfect score, but marks are displayed in
ascending order without indication of which judge awarded which
score.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. pairs skater Garrett Lucash said the system is confusing.
"I'm not crazy about it," he said. "I'd like to see who gives me
what."</TE>
<TE>   "People were concerned about the anonymity of the judges," Howard
said of the test at Skate America. "Proponents say it frees the
judges to judge without influence from their federations, but people
also say judges need to be accountable."</TE>
<TE>   That system will determine the rankings at Skate Canada, but a
separate panel is using the cumulative scoring system. Proposed
during ISU meetings last June in Japan, the cumulative system has
been tested once before, at the Nebelhorn Trophy event. That panel's
decisions will not be made public.</TE>
<TE>   Under the cumulative system, judges assign each skater a technical
mark and a presentation mark. The technical mark is divided into
three categories: elements, skating technique and technical
transitions. The presentation mark is based on performance,
choreography and interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   A random draw will produce 16 judges, with one serving as referee
and another as assistant referee. Of the remaining 14, the scores of
only seven will count.</TE>
<TE>   An expert will be assigned to identify each element skaters
perform. This expert will then put a confirmation into a computer,
which matches the element with a predetermined point value. Each
judge then will award a mark for quality, adding or subtracting three
points per element. For the presentation mark, judges have written
criteria and will mark skaters on a scale of 1-10. The technical and
presentation marks, given equal value, will be added to produce the
cumulative total.</TE>

<TE>   New Ideas to Wrestle</TE>
<TE>   Women's wrestling is scheduled to make its Olympic debut at Athens
in 2004, so the recent launch of a women's resident wrestling program
at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs couldn't have
been better timed.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the U.S. Olympic Committee and the training center opened
the doors for the program, the response was incredible," said Terry
Steiner, hired in April as the first full-time U.S. women's national
wrestling coach. "A lot of these women have been waiting and yearning
for this."</TE>
<TE>   Steiner, who won an NCAA title under Dan Gable at Iowa, has a
seven-woman team at the World Championships this weekend at Halkida,
Greece. Four U.S. women have won silver medals at previous World
Championships and the team will contend for a medal, but Japan,
China, Russia and Canada will offer formidable competition.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner, who has been an assistant coach of men's teams at
Wisconsin and Oregon State, said he finds few technical differences
between working with men and women but finds women to be more
communicative.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real life commitment for the women," he said. "They want
to win and they want help. From that standpoint, it's very similar
and they're very easy to work with. They're very hungry and they
listen to your guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a feeling out there that this should be a
guy's sport exclusively, forever. There will be those feelings until
we start to change people's perceptions. Even [at the training
center], a lot of men freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestlers think, 'Oh,
it's just a hobby,' but now they've seen the women here twice a day,
five or six days a week, it's hard not to respect that. Wrestling
teaches life skills. Why would we want to limit that to half the
population?"</TE>
<TE>   Women will compete in seven weight classes at the world
competition but in four classes at the Olympics, from 48k (about 105
pounds) to 72k (about 158). There aren't enough women's college
programs for the NCAA to sanction the sport, and Steiner said only
Texas and Hawaii sanction girls' high school wrestling, leaving many
girls to wrestle on boys' teams.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen women are in the resident program, which also offers help
with nutrition and psychological preparation. Twenty women will be in
residence by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "You know coming into this position you're fighting attitudes and
history," Steiner said. "I can't think about that. I've got to worry
about the people in front of me, and to me, they're simply athletes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   She's Not Run of the Mill</TE>
<TE>   Marla Runyan will continue her transition to longer distances
Sunday, when she makes her marathon debut in the New York City
Marathon.</TE>
<TE>   Runyan became the first legally blind athlete to compete in the
Olympics when she finished eighth in the 1,500 meters at the 2000
Sydney Games. She has since moved up to longer races and won the U.S.
5K and 10K road race titles this year. She also finished second in
the Philadelphia half marathon last month, not long after she married
her coach, Matt Lonergan. Her concession to the wedding was to run
"only" 65 miles that week instead of her usual 100.</TE>
<TE>   Runyan's blindness is the result of Stargardt's disease, which
causes the retinas to degenerate. She has enough peripheral vision to
follow the painted blue line along the New York marathon route, and
she'll have an escort on a bike to keep her apprised of her split
times and water stops.</TE>
<TE>   The elite women's field, which will start before the men's field
for the first time, also features Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland and
defending champion Margaret Okayo of Kenya. Defending men's champion
and course-record holder Tesfaye Jifar of Ethiopia and 2002 Boston
Marathon winner Rodgers Rop lead the men's field. Also entered is
Eamonn Coghlan of Ireland, the former world indoor mile record
holder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Tim Goebel has resumed full training with Coach Frank Carroll in
El Segundo after a hip injury forced him to withdraw from his two
Grand Prix events.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Eldredge, six-time U.S. men's champion, was granted a waiver
that allows him to keep his Olympic eligibility while he performs in
the Stars on Ice tour. Eldredge, 31, can also enter the U.S.
championships in January at Dallas. The question, though, is whether
he should. Isn't it time to let some youngsters gain national and
international experience?</TE>
<TE>   Local skaters Beatrisa Liang and Yebin Mok finished second and
third, respectively, at the recent Junior Grand Prix event at
Beijing. Liang, of Granada Hills, moved up from fifth after the short
program. Mok, of Los Angeles, led after the short program.</TE>

<HD>Cohen Is Captivating Despite Late Misstep</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>QUEBEC CITY, Canada</DL>
<LD>Sasha Cohen's artistry and balletic grace have hinted at her great
potential, but injuries and inconsistency have kept her off the medal
stand at the Olympics and world figure skating championships.</LD>
<LD>   If her performance Friday at Skate Canada is an indication, her
promise could soon be realized, even though she had to move 3,000
miles from her Laguna Niguel home to accomplish it.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen, who left California and coach John Nicks in September to
train with Tatiana Tarasova in Newington, Conn., was mesmerizing
during her "Malaguena" short program. But her face was as red as the
flower on her dress after she fell on a footwork sequence, a late
misstep that didn't stop the crowd of 5,910 at the Colisee Pepsi from
giving her a standing ovation.</LD>
<TE>   Nor did it keep the judges from ranking her first in the field of
10 with marks that included two 5.9s (out of 6.0) for presentation.
The women's competition ends tonight with the long program, to be
followed by the men's final.</TE>
<TE>   "That was really silly," Cohen said of the error in her first
competition since she changed coaches. "At the end, I'm tired, and
it's a whole new level of footwork for me. It's a challenge I'm still
working on."</TE>
<TE>   Tarasova, the renowned Russian coach who helped Alexei Yagudin
refine his artistry and win gold at the Salt Lake City Olympics, was
pleased. "We only just work a very small period," she said, "but her
talent is special."</TE>
<TE>   Fumie Suguri of Japan was second, followed by Viktoria Volchkova,
a Russian who trains in Chicago. The other U.S. entry, Jennifer Kirk,
was seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Tatiana Totmianina and Maxim Marinin of Russia, skating to jazzy
music from "The Cotton Club," were the class of a shaky pairs field.
Qing Pang and Jian Tong of China were second, with Anabelle Langlois
and Patrice Archetto of Canada third. Tiffany Scott and Philip
Dulebohn of the U.S. were fifth, and fellow Americans Kathryn Orscher
and Garrett Lucash were seventh, one place ahead of Stephanie
Kalesavich and Aaron Parchem.</TE>
<TE>   Elena Grushina and Ruslan Goncharov of Ukraine, also coached by
Tarasova, lead the ice dance field after the original dance.
Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon of Canada are second,
followed by Albena Denkova and Maxim Staviyski of Bulgaria. Melissa
Gregory and Denis Petukhov of the U.S. are eighth. The dance
competition ends Sunday with the free dance.</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel Sandhu of Canada leads the men's field, with Takeshi Honda
of Japan second and Stanick Jeannette of France third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tarasova said Yagudin, who spoke of retirement after a hip injury
forced him to pull out of Skate America before the long program, was
told to rest three to six weeks. He can skate, but he can't jump.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In what must be regarded as one of the most bizarre soccer games in
history, AS Adema, the champion of Madagascar, defeated rival Stade
Olympique l'Emyrne, 149-0, on Thursday in a Madagascan league match
in the port city of Toamasina.</LD>
<LD>   Every one of the 149 goals was an own goal, scored by SOE players
into their own net in protest of a refereeing decision.</LD>
<LD>   According to Radio Madagascar, SOE Coach Ratsimandresy Ratsarazaka
became embroiled in a furious argument with the unidentified referee,
after which his players repeatedly kicked the ball into their own net
while Adema players stood around and watched.</LD>

<TE>   Road Warriors</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy will play the first two months of the 2003 Major League
Soccer season on the road before its new stadium opens in June,
general manager Doug Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   After playing in the Rose Bowl since 1996, the Galaxy will be
moving to a stadium currently under construction in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   The MLS season is expected to begin in April. The decision not to
play any home games until the new stadium is completed was made
because "we want to play as many games as we can in that facility,"
Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the potential difficulties of playing so many road games
to start the season, Coach Sigi Schmid said the decision could
ultimately prove beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a reality of the situation that we have to deal with that,
but it's also something that we're excited about because we know it
means at the end of the day we're going to get to play a lot of games
in an environment that's going to be very fan-friendly and great for
our team and the organization," he said.</TE>

<TE>   Reyna Out Six Months</TE>
<TE>   Claudio Reyna, the Sunderland and U.S. national team midfielder
who helped the United States reach the quarterfinals of the 2002
World Cup, will be sidelined for six months after tearing the
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based orthopedic surgeon Bert Mandelbaum, one of the
U.S. team doctors, traveled to England to examine Reyna after he was
injured Monday while playing for Sunderland in an English Premier
League game against Bolton Wanderers.</TE>
<TE>   Mandelbaum said Reyna, 29, who joined Sunderland from Rangers in
Scotland for a U.S.-record $6.8 million last December, will undergo
surgery in Los Angeles later this month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big blow to lose good players, but that's life,"
Sunderland Coach Howard Wilkinson said on the team's Web site.
"Claudio's problem is someone else's opportunity. His credentials are
there for all to see, but for the immediate and mid-term future he
will not be available, and that's a blow."</TE>

<TE>   Chivas Sale Near</TE>
<TE>   Mexican businessman Jorge Vergara has moved a step closer to

<TE>   The 196 owners of the team held a vote Wednesday night, with 143
in favor of selling their shares to Vergara. Three voted against the
move, 11 abstained and 39 were not present.</TE>
<TE>   Vergara has promised to provide the team with facilities that he
said "will be better than Manchester United's."</TE>

<TE>   Euro 2008</TE>
<TE>   The chances of Greece and Turkey being selected as joint-host of
the 2008 European Championship took a sharp downturn after two days
of clashes between Greek and Turkish fans in Istanbul.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, two people were hospitalized and several others injured
during fighting and stone-throwing between fans of visiting
Panathinaikos and the Istanbul club Fenerbahce, who had played to a

<TE>   Canada and Costa Rica rolled to easy victories at Victoria,
British Columbia, each clinching a berth in the semifinals of the
CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Canada defeated Jamaica, 9-0, after Costa Rica knocked off Haiti,
5-0. The Group B co-leaders will meet Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Today, in Seattle, the United States and Mexico can clinch their
places in the semifinals by defeating Panama and Trinidad and Tobago,
respectively, in the final Group A games.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans need only a tie to secure first place in their
group, while the Panamanians must win in order to stay in the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Logically, it will be very difficult," said Panama Coach Roberto

<TE>   The U.S. women's team has played 283 international games in its
17-year history but has never played Panama, which was thumped, 5-1,
by Mexico after earlier edging Trinidad and Tobago, 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans' defense has not yet been tested, but its offense
has failed to properly ignite in back-to-back 3-0 victories over
Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago. In the latter game, the islanders'
packed defense frustrated the U.S. as much as its own forwards'
miscues.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a minimum of seven players behind the ball at all
times," said U.S. Coach April Heinrichs. "It was one of the best
bunker systems we've played against."</TE>
<TE>   Mia Hamm, who was injured in that game and left at halftime, has
recovered from a deep shin bruise and is available today.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico Coach Leonardo Cuellar said he does not expect Trinidad and
Tobago to adopt the same negative tactic against his team.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't expect that," he said. "For us, Trinidad is going to be
even more dangerous because they gained a lot of confidence after
their performance against the U.S."</TE>

<KH>UCLA AT WASHINGTON Today at Husky Stadium, 4 p.m., TBS</KH>
<HD>Neuheisel Catches a Downward Spiral</HD>
<DH>Coach feeling heat despite getting extension, his team is
struggling, and recruiting violations cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>It's a tried and true means of coping with misery -- finding those
more despondent than you and taking a malicious satisfaction in their
misfortune.</LD>
<LD>   Germans call this feeling Schadenfreude. Although there is no word
to describe it in English, the closest translation at the moment is
believed to be, "The way Bob Toledo feels about Rick Neuheisel."</LD>
<LD>   Toledo has endured hardship as UCLA coach this season, losing
Pacific 10 Conference games to Oregon and California that many
believe the Bruins (5-3, 2-2) should have won.</LD>
<TE>   But Neuheisel, the coach at Washington, is in even more dire
straits. The Huskies (4-4, 1-3) lost their last two games and are
hurtling toward their first non-winning season in 26 years.</TE>
<TE>   There is dissension and apathy among Husky players. And boosters
are questioning the wisdom of the six-year contract extension given
to the coach in September.</TE>
<TE>   Though Toledo won't say so, he must take a measure of pleasure in
Neuheisel's troubles. The Washington coach is a former UCLA
quarterback whose name comes up every time Toledo's job performance
is questioned.</TE>
<TE>   But the 42-year-old Neuheisel's golden-boy image has been
tarnished by multiple recruiting infractions while he was coach at
Colorado in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Toledo was flabbergasted by comments Neuheisel made
about UCLA's recruiting practices last year. The Washington coach
charged that UCLA did not stop recruiting Clayton Walker after the
lineman had committed to the Huskies.</TE>
<TE>   "If you live in a glass house, you shouldn't throw rocks, you know
what I mean?" Toledo told a Seattle reporter during the off-season.
"We never had a problem in the conference until he started talking
about negative recruiting. Now I'm going to start talking."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo accused Neuheisel of twisting the truth in comments to
recruits Jarrad Page and Eric McNeal, safeties who came to UCLA this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the disparity in pay. Toledo makes less than
$600,000 a year while Neuheisel's contract extension calls for $1.2
million a year plus a $1.5-million loan that is his to keep if he
stays for the duration of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   The extension was announced days after a 31-29 loss to Michigan on
a last-second field goal after the Huskies were penalized for too
many players on the field. Understandably, Washington followers
wondered if the coach was worth the cash.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little bit embarrassed that this announcement comes on the
heels of a mortifying defeat," Neuheisel said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Three victories over inferior opponents followed, but all that did
was give the Huskies a false sense of security. The defense was
untested and Neuheisel became infatuated with the passing of senior
quarterback Cody Pickett.</TE>
<TE>   When Washington lost at home to California, 34-27, alarms went
off. Then a razor-thin victory over Arizona was followed by one-sided
losses to USC and Arizona State, causing the Huskies to crack at the
seams.</TE>
<TE>   Lineman Terry Johnson complained about the defensive scheme after
the USC loss and was forbidden from talking to reporters for a week.
Finger-pointing was rampant, with older players suggesting the
younger ones were going through the motions.</TE>
<TE>   "That's kind of the attitude of our team -- we have next year,"
senior guard Elliott Zajac said. "The seniors don't have next year."</TE>
<TE>   During practice Tuesday, safety Greg Carothers walked to the
sideline and overturned benches the Huskies use to sit on during
breaks.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I think we talk too much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the talk continued. Senior linebacker Jafar Williams called
a players-only meeting this week and the seniors addressed the team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's starting to spiral -- you can feel it," Carothers said. "If
you don't realize as a player that, if this game is lost, that it
will really start to spiral, then you're stupid.... Losing this game
could be a pivotal moment in a disaster of a season."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were similarly distressed a week ago, but beating
Stanford, 28-18, temporarily assuaged the desperation triggered by
letting potential victories slip away against Oregon and Cal.</TE>
<TE>   A loss today, however, and the critics will no doubt point out
that Toledo's record since a 10-0 start in 1998 has fallen below
.500, to 22-23.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time since 1989 that UCLA and Washington are
meeting with neither team ranked. Nobody on either side is happy
about that.</TE>

<LD>UCLA (5-3, 2-2) at</LD>
<LD>   WASHINGTON (4-4, 1-3)</LD>
<LD>   Today, 4 p.m.,</LD>
<TE>   Husky Stadium, Seattle</TE>
<TE>   TV -- TBS. Radio -- KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether Matt Moore or Drew Olson is at quarterback,
the offense will be remedial. Washington gives up only 79.2 yards a
game on the ground, but UCLA will make a strong attempt to establish
the run. And the Bruins will continue to run in the second half, when
tailback Tyler Ebell has had his greatest success. Moore or Olson
will take their shots judiciously, but they will take shots. Wide
receivers Craig Bragg and Tab Perry and tight end Mike Seidman have
made too many big plays to be abandoned now. Versatile freshman back
Jason Harrison could be poised for a breakout game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN WASHINGTON HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Look to the air. Quarterback Cody Pickett, who sat out last year's
game against UCLA because of injury, averages 45 passes a game and
completes 63.2% of them. Reggie Williams, with 48 catches for 857
yards and six touchdowns, is the most dangerous receiver, but Pickett
has spread his 17 touchdown passes among six receivers. The nearly
nonexistent Husky running game doesn't figure to improve because
leading rusher Rich Alexis probably won't play because of a rib
injury. Besides Alexis, who has 449 yards, the Huskies have rushed
for 187 yards in 150 carries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Ebell must toil: Bruin quarterbacks Moore and Olson are
inexperienced, so prolific redshirt freshman tailback Ebell must run
well against a Husky defense that is porous against the pass and
stingy against the run.</TE>
<TE>   2. Pick it from Pickett: The Bruin secondary has played extremely
well but has not had many interceptions. Picking off a few of the 50
or so passes thrown by Pickett will ease the burden on the Bruin
offense.</TE>
<TE>   3. The Fikse is in: Nate Fikse had five field goals last week in
his audition as Bruin kicker. He must continue that success without
becoming distracted from his punting duties.</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>For UCLA, the end zone has become like a mirage to a thirsty man
crawling through the desert. The closer the Bruins get, the more
difficult it is to reach.</LD>
<LD>   Consider:</LD>
<LD>   * They have had first and goal inside the five-yard line three
times in the last two weeks without scoring a touchdown.</LD>
<TE>   * They have been inside the 20-yard line 31 times and scored only
13 touchdowns, fewer than any other Pacific 10 Conference team except
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   * In the last three games, 10 trips to the red zone have resulted
in only two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the difficulty is the absence of 240-pound running back
Manuel White, who will sit out his fourth game in a row today because
of a pulled hamstring. But a greater problem has been the passing
game.</TE>
<TE>   Only two of UCLA's 11 touchdown passes have come in the red zone.
Play action hasn't worked. Fade routes haven't worked.</TE>
<TE>   "Defenses are compressing the field [in the red zone] and a lot of
the field is taken away," Coach Bob Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   With a freshman quarterback (either Matt Moore or Drew Olson) and
a small tailback (170-pound Tyler Ebell), UCLA must get creative.
Bigger running backs such as Akil Harris, Wendell Mathis and Jason
Harrison might get carries, or cornerback Matt Ware might play
quarterback and run an option play.</TE>
<TE>   But the passing game must contribute. The best weapon could be
tight end Mike Seidman, who has shown the ability to outwrestle
safeties for passes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the best adjustment is admitting an earlier decision was
a mistake. Ware moved to free safety at the beginning of the season,
but he returned to cornerback five games ago and the Bruin defense
has soared.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has given up only 286 yards and 15.6 points a game with Ware
at cornerback and 397 yards and 33 points a game with him at safety.
The Bruins held their last two opponents, California and Stanford, to
their lowest passing outputs of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Ware, a 6-foot-3 sophomore, typically covers the opponent's
tallest receiver, who today is 6-5 Reggie Williams. However, the
other Bruin cornerback, 5-9 two-time All-Pac-10 choice Ricky Manning,
wants some of Williams too.</TE>
<TE>   "Manning will be upset with us if we don't put him on Williams,"
Toledo said. "He and [defensive coordinator] Phil Snow will have
words. Ricky is a fierce competitor."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA quarterback Cory Paus is recovering from surgery on his
fibula and will watch from home, but there will be a Paus on the
field today. Cory's younger brother, Casey, is a Washington redshirt
freshman and the third-string quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Antwuan Smith, a receiver from Clovis, has received a qualifying
score on the SAT and will enroll at UCLA for the winter quarter.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Fargas to Ask for a Sixth Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though his chances of receiving it are remote, USC running back
Justin Fargas said he would seek a sixth year of eligibility from the
NCAA.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm definitely going to do it," said Fargas, a fifth-year senior
transfer from Michigan who gained 139 yards in his first start last
week against Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   Fargas does not appear to meet the criteria the NCAA requires for
extending a player's eligibility clock. Athletes have five years of
eligibility to complete four seasons of competition.</LD>
<TE>   An NCAA representative said the rare waivers are granted when
athletes miss two seasons of competition within a five-year period
because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the
athlete or institution. Waivers must be requested by an institution
on behalf of an individual.</TE>
<TE>   USC fullback Malaefou MacKenzie, for example, missed his sophomore
season in 1998 because of a knee injury suffered in the opener
against Purdue. He did not play last season because of injuries and
the death of his father. Last spring, USC petitioned on his behalf
and he was granted an extra season of eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt seasons and seasons lost because of transferring,
however, are regarded as being within the control of the athlete or
institution.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas missed only one season because of injury. He played 10
games at Michigan during his freshman season in 1998 before suffering
a broken leg that forced him to miss the 1999 season. He played
running back, safety and on special teams in 2000, then transferred
to USC before the Wolverines played in the 2001 Citrus Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   He sat out last season because of NCAA transfer rules.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Fargas, Justin's father, acknowledged that receiving an
extra year was a longshot. He said he and his son would meet with USC
officials after the season to consider the options. USC would have to
be convinced that Fargas' case had merit.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be an exercise in futility, but it may be an exercise we
have to take," Antonio Fargas said.</TE>

<TE>   With a weekend off because of a bye, some players are staying
close to home, others boarded planes to visit family out of state and
a few intended simply to get away and relax.</TE>
<TE>   Most, however, plan to watch all or part of today's Pacific 10
Conference game between No. 8 Washington State and No. 16 Arizona
State, each 4-0 in conference play. The 11th-ranked Trojans, who
suffered their only Pac-10 loss at Washington State on Oct. 5, need
Arizona State to win today to keep alive their Rose Bowl hopes.</TE>
<TE>   USC will play at Stanford on Nov. 9 and will be host to Arizona
State on Nov. 16.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Arizona State's biggest fan this week," USC quarterback
Carson Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   This is the latest in the season the Trojans have been ranked in
the Associated Press poll since 1995, the last year they won the
Pac-10 title. After that, they went six seasons without being ranked
during the second half of the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's awards banquet will be Dec. 9 at the Regent Beverly Wilshire
Hotel in Beverly Hills. Tickets are $75. Information: (213)
740-4155.... Ambrose Schindler, who led USC to a 14-0 victory in the
1940 Rose Bowl, has been chosen for the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame. He
will be inducted in a ceremony at the Rose Bowl kickoff luncheon in
Pasadena on Dec. 31.</TE>

<HD>Without O'Neal, Lakers Can't Get Foot in Door</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the Lakers, playing without Shaquille O'Neal has been like having
a cellular phone without any air time. It just doesn't work.</LD>
<LD>   With O'Neal out for at least another week while recovering from
toe surgery, the Lakers are finding victories difficult to come by
against teams looking to knock off the three-time defending NBA
champions.</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah, Phil would probably like to put an asterisk by that, but it
doesn't matter to me. A win is a win," Portland's Scottie Pippen said
after the Trail Blazers defeated Phil Jackson's Lakers on Wednesday.
"Obviously, we didn't play the Lakers at their best, but every game
is important to win."</LD>
<TE>   Losing without O'Neal is nothing new for Kobe Bryant and Co. After
beating the Clippers, 108-93, Friday night at Staples Center, the
Lakers are 14-14 without the world's most dominating player in the
lineup since Jackson took over as head coach in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   According to Stats Inc., since the start of the 1999-2000 season,
the Lakers have averaged 101.8 points when O'Neal played and 92.8
when he didn't, not counting Friday's game. They also average nearly
two more rebounds and one extra blocked shot and have a 168-52 record
with O'Neal in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker, Soumaila Samake and Slava Medvedenko may be decent
role players, but they cannot come close to filling O'Neal's enormous
shoes. No one can.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers, who are also without suspended forward Rick Fox,
still have to play the games, and they've made a few offensive
adjustments to help hold them over until O'Neal gets back. More
players cutting without the ball, more quick passes from one side to
the other and more Bryant, who was prepared for the challenge after
adding 15 pounds of muscle during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "They are running Kobe to the post a little bit more," a Western
Conference assistant coach said Friday. "Where Shaq would dip his
shoulder and go from one side of the block to the other to get the
ball, they have Kobe posting up and he comes mainly from the wing
area. He'll cut off from the weak side and go to the strong-side
block to get a few more post opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   In the Lakers' season-opening loss to San Antonio, Bryant took 29
shots, many of them after he had his back to the basket. This tactic
can be effective, but Bryant struggled in that game, missing 20 shots
against the Spurs, who picked their spots when to double-team him.</TE>
<TE>   It's no secret that the Lakers look for Bryant more when O'Neal is
not on the floor, and the triangle offense allows him to get the ball
in various ways.</TE>
<TE>   "They also seem to run more pick-and-roll plays when they play
without O'Neal," the assistant coach said. "They give the ball to
Kobe and let him create off a high screen. They did that a lot
against [San Antonio center Tim] Duncan. Kobe is so good at attacking
big guys, this has worked well for them."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, however, has been criticized for playing too selfishly.
Charley Rosen, a former coach in the Continental Basketball Assn.,
wrote a recent story for ESPN.com claiming that Bryant abandons the
triangle offense and that assistant coach Tex Winter labeled him
"uncoachable."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant disagreed with this characterization Friday, and I agree to
a point.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bryant's shots always increase when O'Neal is out, he
seems to be finding better ways to get the ball to teammates than he
has in the past. He posted a triple-double Friday, with 33 points, 15
rebounds and 12 assists. Until Friday, however, his teammates were
not making their shots. The Lakers shot 31.8% from the field against
the Spurs, 41.2% against the Trail Blazers and 45.9% against the
Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe is so dangerous when he creates and gets into the middle,"
the Western Conference assistant coach said. "He gets people open
shots and with people like [Derek] Fisher, [Robert] Horry and Tracy
Murray, they have the ability to knock them down."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' biggest problem when they play without O'Neal is not
Bryant. It's the fact that the team has been built around two
superstars, and when you take one away, the role players are exposed.</TE>
<TE>   Look at what has happened when they have tried to go back to their
normal triangle attack. Medvedenko is usually in the game when the
Lakers dump the ball into the post, but the offense is simply not the
same.</TE>
<TE>   "People just have to understand that [O'Neal] makes all the
difference in the world for their offense," the assistant coach said.
"He's that good. He makes everything look a whole lot smoother."</TE>
<TE>   Defensively, the Lakers have not changed much structurally without
O'Neal. They still try to force pick-and-roll plays to the baseline,
and their big men don't wander too far from the basket.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers still miss O'Neal's presence in the middle.
Opponents are not afraid to drive into the lane and take the ball to
the basket because they do not fear the Lakers' backup big men.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, Samake and Medvedenko, along with Horry, can block shots
like O'Neal but they are not intimidating. When opposing players
drive on O'Neal, they always have to think about getting roughed up
because of his size and aggressiveness. An elbow here, a hip check
there, it's all part of the game for O'Neal, who is the best in the
league at taking full advantage of his body in the paint.</TE>
<TE>   "San Antonio ran a lot of high pick-and-rolls against the Lakers,"
the assistant coach said. "By doing that, the Lakers didn't really
have anywhere to push the guard with the ball."</TE>
<TE>   But before Laker fans get too worked up, they should realize that
O'Neal's return is right around the corner and in the long run, they
may end up being a more complete team from the experience they gained
playing without him.</TE>

<HD>S. Africa Charges 2 in Alleged Coup Plot; No Arrests in
Blasts</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Police, intensifying a search for suspects in bombings blamed on
white right-wing extremists, charged two men with treason and
terrorism Friday over a separate alleged rightist coup plot.</LD>
<LD>   A number of rightists have been arrested in recent months over
alleged plans to overthrow the South African government.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, police said they were following leads about this week's
bombings, the most serious since apartheid white rule ended in 1994,
but they stressed that they still did not know who was responsible
and said no one had been arrested.</LD>
<TE>   "The investigation has been intensified. We are working very hard
day and night," police spokesman Phuti Setati said.</TE>
<TE>   Nine explosions Wednesday rocked Soweto township near
Johannesburg, South Africa's financial hub, killing a woman. A 10th
explosion in a town near Pretoria injured two people.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say a small right-wing minority wants to provoke a racial
backlash by the black-led government, believing this will encourage
more whites to push for a separate homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Police said in September that they had uncovered a plot to take
over TV stations, police stations, army bases and water supplies and
create chaos for which blacks would be blamed.</TE>
<TE>   In connection with the alleged coup plot, Jurie Johannes
Vermeulen, 35, and Frederick Johannes Naude, 54, were charged in
Pretoria on Friday with treason and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   They will join 15 other suspects to be tried by the High Court in
May.</TE>

<HD>Bush Aides Deployed to Help GOP</HD>
<DH>Critics say White House has gone too far in using many of
its top officials to stump for candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- When Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham campaigned
recently for Republican candidates in Michigan, no one was surprised.
Before joining the Bush administration, he represented that state in
the U.S. Senate. But this weekend, Abraham will be stumping in
Florida instead.</LD>
<LD>   Why there? The Sunshine State is full of "snowbirds" from Michigan
-- retirees fed up with the rugged winters of the Great Lakes region.</LD>
<LD>   Abraham's 11th-hour deployment is just one example of how the
White House has left little to chance in Campaign '02, with control
of a closely divided Congress at stake.</LD>
<TE>   Led by President Bush, the administration has pulled out all the
stops in an attempt to win critical House and Senate seats.</TE>
<TE>   During the last year, First Lady Laura Bush and Lynne Cheney, wife
of Vice President Dick Cheney, also have been pressed into campaign
duty, along with most Cabinet officers.</TE>
<TE>   And in a twist, some senior West Wing staff members have entered
the fray, attending fund-raisers and other political events to
promote GOP candidates from one end of the country to the other.</TE>
<TE>   In the Clinton years, an occasional senior White House aide was
asked to speak at political gatherings in Washington, but there was
no systematic effort to have such aides travel the country, according
to Joe Lockhart, who served as Clinton's press secretary in his
second term.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fair to say that no White House has ever been so totally
mobilized for a midterm election," said Larry J. Sabato, a University
of Virginia political analyst. "Every single asset ... has been
targeted and deployed to maximum effect."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the White House aides have been pressed into campaign duty
because they possess what White House communication director Dan
Bartlett called "star power." These include Mary Matalin, Vice
President Cheney's counselor, and White House Chief of Staff Andrew
H. Card Jr. Another frequent campaigner has been Karen P. Hughes, who
quit as Bush's counselor last summer but remains a presidential
confidant and frequent West Wing visitor.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bush's parents have gotten into the act. Former President
Bush and his wife, Barbara, have made frequent appearances for the
reelection campaign of their son, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. They also
have promoted many other GOP candidates throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   In more than 130 appearances this year, President Bush has raised
in excess of $140 million -- long ago surpassing the $35 million
President Clinton raised for Democrats in the first midterm election
campaign of his presidency. Cheney has raised at least $22 million
more.</TE>
<TE>   The two are scheduled to campaign right up to election day. In a
final burst, Bush's schedule has him visiting 15 states and 17 cities
between Thursday and Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although critics acknowledge that presidents, as titular heads of
their party, are expected to campaign, some say the Bush
administration has gone too far.</TE>
<TE>   "What this president and this White House have done is taken this
role of chief party politician and big money fund-raiser to
inappropriate extremes," said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy
21, a nonpartisan group that promotes campaign finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   But Bartlett dismissed such concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Precedent-wise, I don't believe it's unusual," he said.
"Administration officials in the past have participated in the
election process. It's not only appropriate but expected."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, Matalin and Card declined to comment about their
campaigning, as did Karl Rove, the chief White House political
strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said that whenever White House
personnel or other administration officials engage in political
activities, their expenses are paid by campaign funds, based on an
established formula.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, now paid as a consultant by the Republican National
Committee, has campaigned for candidates not only in her home state
of Texas but in Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and Hawaii.
She also participated, along with Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, in a
"Women for Talent" event in Missouri to promote James M. Talent, who
is running for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jean Carnahan.</TE>
<TE>   Card has campaigned in Michigan, New Hampshire, Maine, his home
state of Massachusetts and South Carolina, where he remains known
because he attended college there. Card also has spoken at
fund-raisers in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Among White House staffers, Matalin has been perhaps the most
peripatetic, appearing at more than a dozen events.</TE>
<TE>   Probably no Republican has benefited more from the
administration's efforts than Jeb Bush, who is in a tight race with
Democrat Bill McBride.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that the president has attended four political events
in Florida and is scheduled to appear with his brother again today in
Tampa. Cheney has appeared at five campaign events in the state and
Cabinet secretaries stumped for the governor at least eight times.
The elder Bushes have appeared on Jeb's behalf more than half a dozen
times.</TE>
<TE>   The former president also has campaigned for candidates in Iowa,
Missouri, Kansas, Maine, Michigan and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Laura Bush had made about half a dozen campaign
appearances, most recently Wednesday night for Rep. Constance A.
Morella (R-Md.), a top Democratic target in Tuesday's vote.</TE>
<TE>   In these final days, Mrs. Bush too will barnstorm the country for
Republicans. On Friday night, she spoke at a dinner in North Carolina
for Senate candidate Elizabeth Hanford Dole. On Saturday, Mrs. Bush
will be in New Hampshire, Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Cheney will have appeared at a dozen or more campaign events
by election day, according to her office.</TE>

<HD>FBI Laments Lack of Anthrax Arrests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III expressed dissatisfaction Friday
that those responsible for last year's deadly anthrax attacks had not
yet been caught, saying scientific analysis of the anthrax spores had
been difficult.</LD>
<LD>   "Am I satisfied? No, because we don't have the person or persons
responsible identified, and charges being brought against them," he
said when asked about the FBI's investigation into the anthrax-laced
letters that killed five people.</LD>
<LD>   "Are we making progress? Yes. And we continue to make progress. We
continue to have a number of individuals that we are looking at," he
told a news briefing. The letters were sent to two U.S. senators and
to the news media.</LD>
<TE>   "We are looking at the scientific analysis of the anthrax and
replicating the ways, or possible way or ways, in which it might have
been manufactured," Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it is not a process that is easily accomplished," he said,
explaining that scientists are undertaking analyses that have never
been done before to get information that might help find the source
of the anthrax, who manufactured it and those capable of obtaining
and making it.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at the DNA of the analysis. We're looking at the
chemical breakdown of the anthrax. We're replicating the manufacture
of the anthrax," Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are ... different scientific studies that are ongoing to
give us all of the information available in the scientific community
on the anthrax," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going into new territory in some areas," Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   And the FBI only has a limited amount of anthrax to analyze, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2001, the FBI released a possible profile of the
anthrax mailer, saying a man in the U.S. most likely sent the letters
and that he was probably a loner with a scientific background.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said the FBI had not updated its profile, but that did not
mean the agency had excluded other possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never ruled out any scenario, and to the extent that
there are leads that come up, whether it be to individuals or methods
of manufacturing or what have you, we pursue them," Mueller said. "No
possibility has been ruled out."</TE>

<LD>The U.S. Interior Department said it evacuated its main headquarters,
a few blocks from the White House, because of high asbestos levels.</LD>
<LD>   Air monitoring tests during the building's renovation detected
asbestos in the cafeteria and mechanical room, which share a
ventilation system.</LD>
<LD>   About 2,300 workers in the department's main building were
dismissed at 11 a.m. Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton was not in the

<LD>The atmosphere was jubilant -- and misty -- at Lincoln Center when
officials turned on its huge centerpiece fountain to mark the end of
six months of emergency water restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   With a forecast for frost this weekend, there were no plans to
turn on fountains elsewhere in the city. But at Lincoln Center, a
crowd cheered as the Revson Fountain sprayed water 15 feet into the
air after being filled with 10,000 gallons.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy rainfall in September and October, combined with
conservation measures, allowed the city to suspend its drought
restrictions.</LD>

<HD>White House Steers Clear of SEC Chief Controversy</HD>
<DH>Fearing political fallout, GOP gives Pitt no public backing
as he takes fire in appointment flap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds and Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>PORTSMOUTH, N.H.</DL>
<LD>White House officials carefully distanced themselves Friday from
embattled Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt,
saying the administration was awaiting the outcome of inquiries into
whether he withheld potentially damaging information about his choice
for a top oversight job.</LD>
<LD>   Away from the White House, senior Republicans focused on the
potential political fallout of the flap, grumbling that Pitt had put
President Bush in an awkward position just before Tuesday's election.</LD>
<LD>   They complained that he had made it all the more difficult for
Bush and Republican candidates to argue that the administration is
responding effectively to the issues of corporate accountability and
investor confidence.</LD>
<TE>   Pitt, a target of attacks for several months, came under new fire
for failing to disclose that William H. Webster -- whom Pitt chose to
lead a new accounting oversight board -- had chaired the audit
committee of a company accused of accounting irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Webster is a retired federal judge who served as director of the
FBI and the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   He was reported to have told Pitt about his role with the company,
U.S. Technologies Inc. But Pitt did not pass on the information to
the White House or other SEC members, who voted 3 to 2 last week to
give him the job on the oversight panel.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's spokeswoman, Christi Harlan, said Friday that after Webster
had informed Pitt about his service on the audit committee, "the
[SEC] staff looked into it, found nothing of concern, so there was
nothing to pass on."</TE>
<TE>   She said Pitt would have no comment and was not available for
interviews. He did not return a call to his office.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials acknowledged that they were in the dark
about Webster's corporate past and that they learned of the
allegations from news reports.</TE>
<TE>   One GOP veteran who held senior White House positions in previous
administrations, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that
Pitt had a "tin ear" for politics and that in its handling of the
matter, the White House was not doing much better.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush should get rid of him right after the election," he said.
"This goes to investor confidence. It goes to corporate
accountability. [Pitt] may be a very fine lawyer, but that doesn't
qualify you for the SEC chairmanship."</TE>
<TE>   Two investigations into Webster's selection have been launched:
one by the SEC's inspector general and another, at the request of
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), by the General Accounting Office.</TE>
<TE>   Scott McClellan, a deputy White House press secretary, said
Friday: "The SEC and Chairman Pitt have indicated that they are
looking into the process involved there .... In terms of the
specifics related to this matter, we don't know the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Bush made no mention of Pitt as he sought to drum up enthusiasm
for Republican congressional candidates Friday during stops in New
Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   The low-key White House response to questions about Pitt -- and
Bush's lack of public support for him -- fueled questions about
whether the chairman would be able to hold onto his position after
the election.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, seeking to minimize any damage the episode might cause,
revisited the issue of corporate responsibility, a theme he had not
raised in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Our message, loud and clear, to the corporate wrongdoers is:
There isn't any easy money in America. There's only jail time when we
catch you fudging the books," Bush told a Republican get-out-the-vote
rally in Portsmouth.</TE>
<TE>   Bush acknowledged that corporate scandals during the last year
have generated a "lack of confidence in the system."</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have [to] reveal the whole truth in the corporate
accounting practices," Bush pledged to Republican voters at his first
stop, in Harrisburg, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt has been a political lightning rod for months. Democrats have
repeatedly called for his resignation, contending that he is too cozy
with the accounting industry to crack down on corporate wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   His latest stumble allowed them to repeat their criticism at a
sensitive moment, just days before an election that will decide
control of the House and Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional Republicans and campaign strategists, normally quick
to parry the Democrats' attacks, have largely responded to the latest
reports with silence.</TE>
<TE>   Their reticence reflected a twofold political calculation.</TE>
<TE>   First, some Republicans were not inclined to jump to Pitt's
defense if the White House was distancing itself from him.</TE>
<TE>   Second, with four days until election day, the Republicans were
reluctant to get drawn into a debate that would distract attention
from their campaign themes.</TE>
<TE>   "This does not necessarily fit into the message mix," said one
aide to the Republican leaders in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Some party officials dismissed the potential effect of the SEC
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be an issue in zero House races in the final days," said
Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   His counterpart at the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
Dan Allen, added: "I don't think it's an issue that's going to
resonate at all at the local level. People are focused on
kitchen-table issues."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some Republican senators have publicly begun to raise
questions about Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   One key Republican, Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, complained of a
"lack of transparency" in the Webster appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a Pitt defender who is the ranking
Republican on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee,
conceded in an interview Thursday that the SEC chairman "has not
turned out to be very good at responding to political attacks." But,
Gramm insisted, "that wasn't why he was appointed."</TE>
<TE>   Gramm added: "I keep hoping that when the elections are over, all
this will end."</TE>

<HD>Candidate Hopes Hard Work Pays Off</HD>
<DH>GOP's Coleman takes it up a notch in the final days of
Minnesota's U.S. Senate race against venerable Democrat Walter
Mondale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DULUTH, Minn</DL>
<LD>DULUTH, Minn.-- How do you run against a political legend?</LD>
<LD>   In the case of Norm Coleman, the Republican who suddenly finds
himself up against Walter F. Mondale in Minnesota's U.S. Senate race,
the answer is: Work harder.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Coleman was up and on the phone to his campaign staff
at 4:45 a.m. By 6, while on his way to Holman Field in St. Paul, he
was conducting a cell-phone interview with a radio station. An hour
later, he was boarding a small plane on his way to campaign stops in
four cities.</LD>
<TE>   Since Wednesday, he has logged nearly 2,000 miles. On Friday, he
traveled from Alexandria, home of a tall Viking statue named Big Ole,
to Hermantown, a community on the outskirts of Duluth, for a rally
that featured Vice President Dick Cheney and former Minnesota Viking
football coach Bud Grant.</TE>
<TE>   Before the night ended, he was in Minneapolis for a televised
debate, though it was not quite the encounter he would have
preferred.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman squared off with the Senate nominees of the Green and
Independence parties--but not Mondale, who became the Democratic
candidate after Sen. Paul Wellstone was killed Oct. 25 in a plane
crash.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the daunting challenge of facing Mondale, who before
serving as vice president in the Carter administration represented
Minnesota in the Senate for 12 years, Coleman said, "I'm just trying
to outwork him."</TE>
<TE>   He really has little other choice of strategies. The former mayor
of St. Paul finds himself days before the election in a peculiar
political place, coping not only with Mondale but also with an
outpouring of public sympathy for Wellstone.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Win one for Wellstone' is a hard slogan to beat," said John J.
Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.
"Coleman not only has to defeat an experienced politician, he also
has to overcome a ghost."</TE>
<TE>   Pitney added: "Coleman had been running against Wellstone as an
out-of-touch leftist. Now he must run against someone who personifies
the establishment. He started by running against the 1960s. Now he
has to run against the 1950s."</TE>
<TE>   The race between Wellstone and Coleman had been tight, and all
this year it had been viewed as one of the most crucial in
determining which party controls the Senate. Now it has become a
nationally watched political drama.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unimaginable," Coleman said. "You just kind of deal with
it the best you can."</TE>
<TE>   The Brooklyn, N.Y.-born Coleman, 53, a Democrat turned Republican,
acknowledges the steep climb he faces against "Mount Rushmore," a
term he used for the 74-year-old Mondale earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   But Coleman insists he is not discouraged. "It's going to be a
close race," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted Friday that he has been campaigning for two years;
Mondale has been at it for two days, since he was officially named
Wellstone's replacement by state Democrats on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders clearly have not given up on Coleman. First Lady Laura
Bush will follow Cheney into the state today, and President Bush will
campaign for Coleman on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail Friday, Coleman was encouraged by large
turnouts, especially at a packed rally of more than 2,000 supporters
in Hermantown, where he shared the spotlight with Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, in his speeches throughout the day, made a point of
mourning Wellstone's passing. But he also pounded away at a campaign
theme that has gained greater emphasis since Mondale's entry into the
race.</TE>
<TE>   "The future is now," he said repeatedly. "We can't go back to the
way it was."</TE>
<TE>   He never once, however, mentioned Mondale by name. He also said he
has asked national GOP officials not to air a television ad picturing
Mondale and President Carter and flashing the such words as "gasoline
rationing," "double-digit inflation" and "massive defense cuts."</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a reporter if he had ever voted for Mondale, Coleman
dodged the question. "That was so long ago I can hardly remember," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mondale boarded a bus and conducted town hall meetings
on Friday in Mankato and Rochester before heading north to Duluth.</TE>
<TE>   He passed on Friday's debate because, an aide said, he wanted to
spend more time talking with voters.</TE>
<TE>   The aide said Mondale is willing to debate Coleman, but no
arrangements have been worked out.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman appeared comfortable working the crowds Friday. And he is
hoping that as Tuesday's vote approaches, more and more Minnesotans
will echo the thoughts of Mary Freeman, 79, who drove 60 miles to
hear Coleman at a campaign stop in Bemidji.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman said that, although she respects Mondale, he is the "same
old, same old."</TE>
<TE>   'I don't have anything to say against Mondale," she said. "He's a
nice man. But he's had his day."</TE>
<TE>   At the rally in Alexandria, Tracy Weaver, 45, a pastor, said he
believes that Democrats may have damaged themselves by turning
Wellstone's memorial service earlier this week into a political
rally.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so disappointed by the way Paul's memorial service was
handled," he said. "In a sense, I wish they would have let the
Republicans handle the memorial service. They would have honored him
more respectfully than the Democrats did."</TE>
<TE>   As he barnstormed the state, Coleman brought along his wife,
Laurie, his son, Jacob, 16, and his father, Norman Sr., 78. Coleman
rarely talked about issues in detail. But that is a difficult task
for a man on the run.</TE>

<HD>Detroit Priest Sentenced for Sex With Boy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest who admitted molesting at least a dozen boys
going as far back as the 1940s pleaded no contest Friday to sexual
conduct with a 13-year-old boy.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Burkholder, 83, who lives in Hawaii, was sentenced to 30
days in jail and five years' probation. He also must register as a
sex offender.</LD>
<LD>   In August, Burkholder was charged with engaging in sexual conduct
with the boy while the pair vacationed in Hawaii in 1986.</LD>
<TE>   The trip was an eighth-grade graduation present to the boy,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   A no-contest plea is not an admission of guilt but is treated as
such for sentencing purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The Archdiocese of Detroit says Burkholder has not been defrocked
but is on a leave of absence and has been banned from wearing the
collar and calling himself a priest.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne County Prosecutor Michael Duggan has branded Burkholder "one
of the worst pedophiles we have ever had in this state."</TE>
<TE>   Burkholder's attorney has said his client has dementia, a claim
Duggan labeled a "sham."</TE>
<TE>   "We just got carried away," Burkholder told the Detroit News,
referring to the boy. "He might have been lonely. And priests are
lonely persons, too. We need friendships, and kids love priests. I
weakened. I was looking for affection."</TE>

<HD>Debate Renewed Over Treatment of Haitians</HD>
<DH>A policy change means recent arrivals are incarcerated
while claims are processed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>MIAMI -- The mad dash of scores of Haitians to reach America's shores
this week has rekindled intense debate about the new -- many say
discriminatory -- treatment that migrants from the Caribbean island
nation receive.</LD>
<LD>   Since December, Haitians who illegally enter the United States and
request asylum are routinely incarcerated while their claims are
processed -- the only nationality that is detained as a matter of
Bush administration policy, critics say.</LD>
<LD>   "It's racist, it's immoral, it's an abomination if you ask me,"
said state Rep. Phillip J. Brutus (D-North Miami), a Haitian American
member of the Florida Legislature.</LD>
<TE>   "The only crime these people have committed is to try to escape
for their lives, to come to a country where there is a promise of
freedom," said Joseph Bapthol, chief operating officer at the Haitian
American Foundation, a Miami-based health and social service
organization. "I really think immigration policy should be uniform
for anyone, regardless of where they come from."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, as television transmitted images live throughout the
country, a ramshackle wooden cargo ship crammed with migrants beached
near Miami's Rickenbacker Causeway, and the passengers waded and swam
to the busy roadway.</TE>
<TE>   One hundred fifty adult male Haitians who were apprehended by
police are being held at the Krome Avenue detention center west of
Miami, while 35 women and 26 children were being housed in a hotel,
said Barbara Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the local office of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. An additional 21 people were
plucked from the sea by the Coast Guard.</TE>
<TE>   "The detainees' needs are being met," Gonzalez said. "Everyone is
in real good condition and there are no medical issues at this
point."</TE>
<TE>   "These individuals are being treated fairly, appropriately and
humanely," Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   However, amid indications that the Haitians might languish in
detention for months, their fate quickly became an issue in the last
days of Florida's gubernatorial election campaign. Democrat Bill
McBride, who needs a heavy turnout Tuesday among African American
voters to have a hope of beating Gov. Jeb Bush, accused the
Republican incumbent of not doing enough to help Haitian migrants.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor should have been out in front on this, using his
power and the bully pulpit," McBride told community leaders in
Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The same day, Bush said that, although he doesn't have a "magic
wand" to alter policies of his older brother, President Bush, "I can
guarantee you I have a lot more influence on the White House and the
administration than Bill McBride."</TE>
<TE>   In a policy switch that is still shrouded in mystery, the Bush
administration in December ordered Haitians landing without documents
to be detained while immigration officials process their asylum
claims or order them deported. Foreigners from other countries are
customarily released into the custody of family members and social
service organizations, said Cheryl Little, executive director of the
Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically the Haitians have been singled out for special
discriminatory treatment, and it continues to this day," said Little,
whose organization filed suit against the policy in March.</TE>
<TE>   According to the bipartisan state legislative caucus of Miami-Dade
County, 96% of Haitians arriving illegally were being released as of
November 1991, but the rate plummeted to 6% by the end of last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unconceivable for these men, women and children who endured
eight days of life-threatening waters aboard a rickety boat not [to]
be given the same opportunity afforded my Cuban brothers and sisters
to apply for political asylum," said Rene Garcia, incoming Republican
chairman of the legislative delegation, of the Haitians who landed
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who chairs a Senate
subcommittee on immigration, held a hearing on the new policy toward
Haitian refugees and was frustrated by the Bush administration's lack
of a response.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't get anyone to take responsibility for that decision
to treat the Haitians differently," said Stephanie Cutter, Kennedy's
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for details about the policy, Jorge Martinez, a spokesman
for the Department of Justice, would say only that a statement was
being prepared.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the lawsuit filed by Little's group, Peter Michael
Becraft, acting deputy director of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said in an affidavit in March that the new approach was
designed to deter a "mass migration" of Haitians by sea, which could
lead to the deaths of many by drowning, starvation or thirst.</TE>
<TE>   "It is simply biased and even racist because when the Cubans come,
they receive them as people coming to heaven," countered Henry Frank,
executive director of the Haitian Centers Council, a social services
organization based in Brooklyn, N.Y. "But when the Haitians come,
they give them hell."</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1965 Cuban Adjustment Act, anyone fleeing the
communist-ruled island who reaches the United States is eligible for
permanent residency in one year. "We're saying this policy should
apply to every refugee who touches land," Brutus said.</TE>
<TE>   According to U.S. Rep. Thomas G. Tancredo (R-Colo.), leader of a
congressional caucus seeking stricter controls on immigration,
because of a legal "remnant of the Cold War," it's the Cubans, and
not the Haitians, who are treated differently.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, a lobbying group that also seeks increased
controls on immigration, defended the policy of detaining illegal
Haitians and others, saying it was one of the most effective tools
for U.S. authorities to discourage foreigners from attempting to
enter without visas.</TE>
<TE>   "Left unchecked, we are going to be swamped," Stein said. "And
every time you give people asylum who don't deserve it, you are
letting them line-jump in front of millions of people who are legally
waiting their turn."</TE>
<TE>   For many in Haiti, the risks of a sea passage to Florida are
undoubtedly worth it. Unemployment is near 70%, an estimated 80% of
the population lives in abject poverty, and life expectancy is less
than 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   In a tacit rebuttal of claims that U.S. policy is discriminatory,
Ashcroft said in his statement that since 1999, approximately 58,000
Haitians had legally migrated to the United States, giving the
Caribbean nation the fourth-highest rate of legal U.S. immigration.</TE>
<TE>   The freighter that ran aground Tuesday also carried three illegal
migrants from the Dominican Republic, according to U.S. officials.
Brutus said that during a visit to the Krome detention center, he was
told that the Dominicans would be freed as soon as police background
checks were complete, while their Haitian fellow passengers would
remain behind the concertina wire.</TE>
<TE>   "As of today, this is a very fluid case, and we're not going to
talk about what the disposition is going to be," said Maria Elena
Garcia, another INS spokeswoman in Miami, when asked to comment.</TE>

<HD>Burial Box Linked to Jesus Is Damaged</HD>
<DH>After transit, new cracks are found in casket that may have
held bones of Christ's brother, James.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>A 2,000-year-old casket, thought by experts to be the first proof of
the existence of Jesus Christ outside of the Bible, was damaged en
route to Toronto for its first public showing, museum officials said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The small limestone box, known as an ossuary, is thought to have
contained the bones of James, the brother of Jesus. It is inscribed
with the words "James, Son of Joseph, Brother of Jesus" and has been
dated to about AD 63.</LD>
<LD>   Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum said the 20-inch-long ossuary
arrived from Tel Aviv via New York on Thursday, but when it was
opened several new cracks were showing on the back, end and front.</LD>
<TE>   "In transit there must have been further impact to the piece, or
some kind of damage ... we can't really tell, but incipient cracks
grew and other cracks appeared," said Dan Rahimi, the museum's
director of collections management.</TE>
<TE>   If the ossuary is authentic, it may be the most important find in
the history of New Testament archeology: the earliest known
nonbiblical reference to Jesus, some academics believe.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of the box is reported to have bought it for a few
hundred dollars in the 1970s and been unaware of its possible
significance.</TE>
<TE>   Its existence was revealed at a news conference in Washington on
Oct. 21 by Biblical Archeology Review magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Rahimi said the box was still intact but there was concern that
new cracks, bigger than a hairline, could make it unstable.</TE>
<TE>   One of the cracks runs through the latter part of the inscription
"James, Son of Joseph, Brother of Jesus," he said. The inscription is
in Aramaic, a language used about 2,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rahimi, an archeologist who has worked in the Middle East,
believes the cracks can be treated in a museum's conservation lab and
will not diminish its overall importance.</TE>
<TE>   The ossuary is valued at about $2 million, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Museum officials said their expert on ceramic and stone examined
the box Friday and prepared two proposals for the owner to consider.
Digital images of the damage were also sent to him.</TE>
<TE>   Rahimi said the owner, a private collector in Jerusalem, had
packed and sent the ossuary to Toronto. He was described as being
upset about the damage, but understood the issues.</TE>
<TE>   Rahimi said among the treatments proposed was to inject an
adhesive into the cracks that will fill in parts of the damage.</TE>
<TE>   "The options are technical in a way, but one of the questions we
will ask the owner is how much cosmetic work he will want done, if
any, to the piece," he said, adding that museum experts hoped to
start work on the ossuary Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Museum officials said they still planned to put the box on display
from Nov. 16 to Dec. 29.</TE>

<HD>The Final Mission Is Completed</HD>
<DH>The fate of Lt. Bill Lewis, whose plane was shot down over
Germany in WWII, was a mystery until his daughter and a friend set
out to solve it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OBERHOF, Germany</DL>
<LD>Bill Lewis was closing in on the day he would return to his wife,
Eleanor, and their baby daughter when he climbed into his P-51
Mustang on Sept. 11, 1944, for the mission deep into German airspace
that would be his last.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot, just 22, and hundreds of others like him would be
shielding a massive squadron of U.S. bombers from attack by Luftwaffe
warplanes. Their ultimate targets were the factories and oil
refineries that made up the industrial heartland of the Nazi empire.</LD>
<LD>   From his concrete barracks on the plains of England's southeast
coast, Lewis had flown dozens of combat missions and had yet to make
direct contact with a German plane. "As far as I'm concerned," he
wrote his mother on July 26, commenting on his comfortable quarters
and bed with sheets, "I don't know very much about war."</LD>
<TE>   Heading east toward the oil refineries of Ruhland that were their
targets, Lewis and 35 other American pilots found themselves locked
in battle with German fighters in the blue skies over Germany's lush
Thurlingian Forest. In an intense dogfight that lasted no more than
10 minutes, the enemy planes hurtled toward each other in a deadly
airborne dance. By noon, four American planes were down.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody saw Lewis get hit, but one American pilot said he saw a
P-51 flying upside down and on fire just before it plunged into the
deep pine cover of a mountain peak known as the Griefenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Adalbert Wolf was a soft-spoken man who lived alone and took long
walks in the ancient Thurlingian Forest surrounding his mountain
village of Oberhof. It was a few days after the fiery fight in the
skies when, he later told relatives and friends, he came across the
wreckage of an American fighter plane smoldering on the slopes of the
Griefenberg.</TE>
<TE>   The gaping hole it had made in the forest floor was still smoking,
the ground and trees in all directions littered with tiny fragments
of fuselage and human remains.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf could not leave the man to hang in pieces in the trees, his
niece, Regina Wolf, recalled recently. He gathered what he could and
buried it nearby. He must have found dog tags or something else
bearing the pilot's name. Because there it was on a wooden cross Wolf
crafted and drove into the ground where the plane had gone down: W
Lewis USA gef. 11.9.44. "Gef," abbreviated German for "fallen."</TE>
<TE>   What Wolf knew about W Lewis's fate would remain hidden for more
than six decades. After the war, he tried to tell authorities, but
his town was by then locked tight behind the Iron Curtain separating
East Germany from West. Wolf's attempts to bring attention to the
crash site earned him little but trouble, according to his family.</TE>
<TE>   He came under surveillance by East Germany's notorious Stasi
secret police, who filed a report on the crash but never told Western
authorities. The scarred slopes sprouted new grass and tall pines.
Wolf, his life shattered by the pressure of being watched by the
Stasi, died in 1984. The cross became old and worn. And the secret of
who perished on that hillside was frozen in the chill of the Cold
War.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a crisp morning early last summer, the stillness of the
Griefenberg was broken by the sounds of spades and shovels. Led to
this place by a trail of evidence, sightings and the deeply personal
motivations of an unlikely assortment of people, a U.S. Army
excavation team had arrived to plumb its secrets.</TE>
<TE>   The team was from an Army unit in Hawaii, half a world away.
Created after the Vietnam War primarily to find and recover Americans
missing in action in Southeast Asia, the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory -- CILHI, as it is known -- is relatively
new to the task of bringing home American servicemen who died in the
Second World War.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, there are more than 78,000 American servicemen still
listed as missing in action from World War II, dwarfing the roughly
1,900 still unaccounted for from Vietnam. While many of the dead went
down on ships in large naval battles and are unlikely ever to be
recovered, thousands more perished in places that most Americans
assume have long given up their secrets -- the fields and mountains
of Europe among them.</TE>
<TE>   But in the 1940s, there were no helicopters to speedily extract
the fallen from battlefields and only primitive means to raise them
from watery graves. Unreliable radar made keeping track of warplanes
difficult, and unsophisticated technology for identifying remains
made giving a name to badly charred or disintegrating corpses
daunting.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was there much political clamor to bring the World War II
missing home. Unlike the families of those who fought in Vietnam,
angry at a society that came to oppose the war, the families of the
men who disappeared in World War II lived in a country that
questioned -- and expected -- less. Telegrams like the one William
Lewis' mother received -- "YOUR SON WILLIAM LEWIS HAS BEEN REPORTED
MISSING IN ACTION SINCE ELEVEN SEPTEMBER OVER GERMANY" -- shattered
lives but not trust in country.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, that attitude has begun to change. Driven
by a resurgence of interest in all things related to the war that
brought down the Nazis, and pleas from World War II veteran groups
whose members are dying at the rate of 30,000 a month, federal money
has begun to flow. Since 2000, CILHI's annual budget has nearly
doubled to about $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   The new funding has bolstered a little-noted effort by the
military, aviation buffs, historians and families to search out World
War II missing that already has had startling results. In 1995, just
five missing World War II servicemen were recovered by CILHI. Since
then the number has jumped to more than 30 each year. Increasingly,
the focus is on Europe.</TE>
<TE>   That is what broke the quiet of the Thurlingian Forest last
summer. A dozen Army specialists, led by an archeologist and aided by
volunteers, hacked at the soft, grassy mounds beneath the tall pine
trees with shovels, rakes, sifters and brooms, looking for Bill
Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lewis had made it home to Tulsa, Okla., in April 1944, just in
time for the birth of his daughter, Sharon. He had only a few days
with his new family before heading to England.</TE>
<TE>   Within six months, he had completed half of his overseas tour,
which called for 300 hours of flying time. Eleanor began to hope that
he could be home by Christmas. Lewis spoke to his fellow pilots often
of his beloved wife and young daughter, several recalled, keeping
careful track of when he might rejoin them and take up the life he
had left behind.</TE>
<TE>   As for Eleanor Lewis, a stack of worn and yellowed newspaper
clippings carefully cut and stowed away in a cardboard box are
testament to what she must have endured in the days, weeks and months
after her husband disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   The clippings gave her good reason to worry. They detailed the
massive raids on three consecutive days that September targeting
cities, factories and oil refineries deep in eastern Germany. The
new, faster and more agile planes like that flown by her husband were
essential to the battle plan, because their longer range allowed them
to accompany the bombers farther into German territory than ever
before.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 1,131 American bombers and 440 fighter planes set out for
German skies on that Sept. 11 mission. More than 500 German planes
were there to fight them. By day's end, 40 American bombers and 17
fighters were lost.</TE>
<TE>   "The big raid of the 11th and 12th with around 439 fighters has
worried me so much and I'm living for [Bill's] letters of those
dates," Eleanor wrote her mother on Sept. 13. "I sure do love that
man and miss him terribly. He'll be back soon and I'll be so happy. I
can hardly wait."</TE>
<TE>   The telegram arrived 11 days later.</TE>
<TE>   Grief-stricken and frightened, Eleanor, just turned 23, pushed the
Army relentlessly for information about his disappearance. Might he
have been taken prisoner? Could he have survived a crash and be
wandering, dazed and alone, in enemy territory? War Department
records show she got little response.</TE>
<TE>   Her waiting got harder before it got easier. As the war ended, the
newspapers were filled with stories of young men coming home from the
war. Eleanor, dispirited, living with her mother and caring for her
baby, clipped and saved them.</TE>
<TE>   "Tulsa Flier Liberated" read one headline she stashed away in her
trunk. And another: "Area Aviator Returns Home."</TE>
<TE>   Though Bill never came home, a church friend of theirs, Nelson
Williamson, did. A soldier who had fought in the Battle of the Bulge,
he left a party at his mother's house celebrating his safe return at
war's end to search out Eleanor when he heard of her plight. When
Sharon, standing on the porch as a toddler with her mother, saw the
tall man in uniform walking toward them, she ran to him, crying,
"Daddy!"</TE>
<TE>   By 1946, hopes faded. The Army, still in the dark about the
flier's fate, sent Eleanor a letter declaring him officially dead.
With the letter came a Purple Heart. The next year, Eleanor married
Williamson, and they started a new home and life. He adopted Sharon,
and the couple had two children of their own. The young widow's grief
mellowed, taking a quiet place in the far recesses of her memory.</TE>
<TE>   Into that same place went her thoughts of Lewis, the clippings and
other memorabilia, packed away in a cardboard suitcase she bound with
string and stashed on a high closet shelf in her mother's house. As
Sharon grew, Eleanor told her who her real father had been, but not
much more.</TE>
<TE>   The box remained unopened until Sharon was in her 20s. One day her
grandmother retrieved it from the closet. As Sharon remembers the
moment, her mother at first denied knowing anything about it. When
Sharon unknotted the string and started pulling out the photos and
letters and the medal, her mother's eyes filled with tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember as a child when my grandmother, my real dad's
mother, would come visit, my mom and my new father didn't want to
hear about Bill," Sharon, now 58, recalled in a recent interview. "
'That was in the past. Bill was gone. Bill was dead. Let's just move
on.' "</TE>
<TE>   But for her entire childhood, every time Sharon saw a man in
uniform she imagined that maybe he would turn around, walk toward her
and be her daddy, Bill Lewis, come home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Cross was at a New Year's party celebrating the millennium
when talk turned to her dad. A mother twice over, Cross at age 56 was
a warm woman given to big turquoise jewelry and comfortable living in
suburban Houston. She did not often dwell openly on the mystery of
her father's death.</TE>
<TE>   She knew he had been lost in World War II. She had seen the
photos, some letters, the Purple Heart. But her childhood fantasy
that her dad would someday return was bundled away in adulthood as
tightly as the ties binding that trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Now her mother was dead, her stepfather had remarried, a new
century was starting and she was feeling melancholy, saddened that
she knew so little about the man who had given her life. She had seen
"Saving Private Ryan," and been moved by its tales of World War II
dead, by the image of P-51s, the plane she knew her father had flown,
sweeping in over Normandy. She learned there were others like her
searching for answers.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, I'd like to get involved in that. There was an interest
nationwide in World War II that had not happened before. I hadn't
thought about my dad for years, but I just got stirred to do
something," Cross said. "I wanted to know. I want my children to know
their heritage. Mom's dead and I'm angry at myself that I started
asking these questions too late to help her. But I want to bring Dad
home."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon enlisted the help of a family friend, Ken Breaux, a former
Vietnam-era naval officer who had his own ghosts to chase. Breaux had
trained as an aviator, but when he saw the rate at which Navy pilots
were dying in Vietnam, he managed to secure a position that afforded
him the relative safety of a ship. He never completely conquered the
guilt he felt that others were dying instead of him.</TE>
<TE>   Breaux, a computer consultant, took up the search for Lewis as a
personal crusade. Using his knowledge of military aircraft and the
Internet, he tackled what he thought would be a relatively simple
mystery.</TE>
<TE>   His inquiry at first led nowhere. There was no burial place for
William Lewis in any cemetery maintained by the American Battle
Monuments Commission. No explanation of his disappearance existed in
U.S. military records. There was no definitive civilian record of his
death in the U.S. After 57 years, Lewis was still missing in action.</TE>
<TE>   "When I began this search, I felt that it was possible that
Sharon's mother had known of the circumstances, but that after her
marriage and the passage of years, she had simply chosen not to tell
Sharon of the details," Breaux said recently. "Now I felt that it was
possible that Bill Lewis' loss was a mystery that even the Army Air
Forces, with all their resources, had failed to solve."</TE>
<TE>   Breaux's research took him into the expanding universe of people
who are caught up in the story of World War II missing. Some had lost
family or friends in the war. Some, like Breaux, were veterans who
felt the guilt of survivors. Some were aviation buffs or adventurers
who set off on their own for places like Papua New Guinea, looking
for World War II aircraft crash sites. Others, like Sharon, had been
children when they lost fathers in the war and were only now asking
serious questions. The Internet brought all those different people
together with new ease.</TE>
<TE>   And so it was that, after months spent surfing online bulletin
boards and putting out queries about the missing Bill Lewis, Breaux
signed on to his computer one evening in January 2001 and was greeted
by a most amazing e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   It was from one Jan Zdiarsky, writing from the town of Kovarska in
the Czech Republic. Zdiarsky wrote that he had been researching a
little documented air battle for many years, assembling detailed
accounts of all the pilots, German and American. According to his
records, he wrote, of 140 airmen killed, captured or missing in
action, only a William M. Lewis had not yet been found.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Zdiarsky said he believed that a colleague had
discovered the crash site of Lewis' plane two years earlier, in a
forest a few hours from Kovarska, in what had been East Germany.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had been trying to find Lewis' family ever since.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In March 1982, workers rewiring the electrical system of a school
building in Kovarska, a Czech town that had been occupied by Nazi
Germany, came across a bundle in an air shaft. Wrapped in a pair of
World War II-era flying overalls, inside a leather wallet, were
documents bearing the name Staff Sgt. John C. Kluttz of Dallas,
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The dusty bundle fell at the feet of Jan Zdiarsky, then 12,
standing with other schoolchildren watching the repair work.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery excited Jan's imagination. He had heard the stories
old men told about a great air battle fought over Kovarska. But in
Czechoslovakia, by then in the Soviet sphere, gathering facts about
the battle was not easy. For years Jan and his friends secretly
combed forests and fields, often finding shards of fighter plane
fuselage. What they pieced together was that indeed a great battle
had been fought over Kovarska's skies. The plane piloted by John
Kluttz was just one of a half-dozen aircraft, American and German,
that had crashed in and around the town.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By the time Zdiarsky hooked up with Breaux, he was a grown man
whose boyish interests had led to great things. Fueled by curiosity
and passion, he had founded a museum in Kovarska dedicated to the
memory of the Sept. 11 battle and to the men, American and German,
who had fought in it.</TE>
<TE>   "Children like to solve mysteries, puzzles," said Zdiarsky, now 32
and a computer technician at a university near Kovarska.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one afternoon when I was sitting in a meadow, on the
grass, and I had just found some parts of airplane fuselage and I
thought, 'Somebody was killed in this airplane. Somebody was
victorious that day.' Sitting there, I began to have this dream of
knowing who those boys were who had fought each other in those
airplanes. It became the dream that has carried me along to today."</TE>
<TE>   Zdiarsky had traveled far and wide pursuing the pieces to his
puzzle. When the Cold War walls came down, he cobbled the money
together to come to the United States to continue his research. At
the National Archives in College Park, Md., he found a treasure
trove: a list of every American pilot who had flown on the Ruhland
missions that day, their flight orders and their craft.</TE>
<TE>   From that and other public but long-ignored records, Zdiarsky
painstakingly pieced together the stories of the men who had fought
the battle he had come to think of as his own. But he was not quite
finished. One missing piece was the fate of Lt. William M. Lewis, who
the records showed had flown on the mission that day but not
returned.</TE>
<TE>   "Our search at first was not personal," Zdiarsky recalled. "Bill
Lewis at first was just one of 80 airmen who had been killed in our
battle. He was special only in that we knew he was still missing. He
was interesting to us as is a piece of a mosaic that you need to
find."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Europe, Zdiarsky scoured German records, and concluded
that at least one plane must have gone down near Oberhof. Zdiarsky
figured that if he could find a crash site near the German village,
he might discover what had become of Lewis. In the spring of 1999,
overwhelmed with work at his job, he sent two friends to search.</TE>
<TE>   At the base of a pine tree, surrounded by shards of airplane
fuselage small and large, they found what Zdiarsky, Cross and Breaux
now believe was the answer: A wooden cross, its once yellow paint
flaking and faded, still stood. On its arms, in red paint, still
legible, was written: W Lewis USA gef. 11.9.44.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Cross and Breaux in Houston, and Zdiarsky in the Czech
Republic, were winding through their separate odysseys, pressure was
building in Washington to do more to find World War II fighters still
missing.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, most of CILHI's emphasis had been on the former
battlefields of the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   But veteran groups, allied with Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), the son
of a World War II aviator who died in action and a Vietnam vet
himself, pushed through legislation that provided a major jump in
funding for the World War II recovery efforts.</TE>
<TE>   At CILHI, the increased money bought tangible change. Staffing
went up by 50, including a phalanx of scientific investigators.
Today, CILHI deploys 18 search and recovery teams about 180 days a
year, their mission to bring back people such as Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with shovels, old maps and diagrams of vintage airplanes,
they dig around the world, sifting through thousands of buckets of
dirt, searching for bone fragments and tiny pieces of equipment that
a fighter pilot would have worn more than half a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   They bring their findings to the unit's Hawaii laboratories, which
have the largest staff of forensic anthropologists and odontologists
in the world.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Houston, Breaux shared the extraordinary news with Cross: His
Internet search had turned up a stranger in the Czech Republic who
might lead them to her father. Their evidence was enough to launch
the Hawaii army investigators on the case.</TE>
<TE>   The CILHI team got to Oberhof on a sunny afternoon in July and
started digging.</TE>
<TE>   They were about a dozen young men, products of today's volunteer
army, a military whose foundational promise is to take care of its
own.</TE>
<TE>   It pledges to its members that if they die while doing their job
-- in Afghanistan, in Somalia, in Iraq -- the military will find them
and bring them home.</TE>
<TE>   The men doing the digging all had stories to tell about why their
assignment was meaningful.</TE>
<TE>   One, Tech Sgt. Dennis Shields of Hillman, Mich., lost his father
in a building fire. His dad's body was never found.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have helped me to have closure if I could have buried
his body," Shields said, sifting through mud and debris at the
Oberhof crash site.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think about him every day, so this is a way that I can
bring closure to other people."</TE>
<TE>   Within three weeks, the diggers had found and cataloged hundreds
of pieces of bone, airplane fuselage and fragments of the survival
equipment the pilot was wearing when the plane went down.</TE>
<TE>   While the team flew on to another crash site, in Bulgaria, the
bits and pieces gathered at Oberhof were sent to Hawaii for forensic
analysis that could take a year or more. The tests could confirm what
Sharon Cross, Ken Breaux and Jan Zdiarsky now believe -- that Bill
Lewis perished on the slopes above Oberhof long ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adalbert Wolf, the man who found W. Lewis and fashioned his cross,
left no letters or documents chronicling his very private encounter.</TE>
<TE>   His niece, Regina, was 6 when the plane came down. She was on the
slopes of the Griefenberg last July, looking down from a ridge at the
American soldiers conducting their search.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf had gone back to the site again and again, bringing flowers,
she said, and sitting for hours alone. He worried about the family of
the downed pilot, hoping for news.</TE>
<TE>   "When he talked about that place, it was always with great
sadness," Wolf said. "He said it was as if he buried his brother
there. This man was not the enemy for him, he was like a person he
knew.</TE>
<TE>   "His whole life he wanted Lewis' relatives to know what had
happened there. It was something he felt in his heart," Wolf said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a very good ending for him if the relatives of this
man get their answers."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Police investigating the killing of Run-DMC member Jam Master Jay
said they have several competing theories about the motive.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a wake was planned for Monday and a funeral Tuesday for
37-year-old Jason Mizell, who as Jam Master Jay worked the turntables
as Joe "Run" Simmons and Darryl "DMC" McDaniels rapped a string of
hits over the years.</LD>
<LD>   Police on Friday discounted an earlier hypothesis that a wider
music industry feud prompted a masked gunman to fire one .40-caliber
bullet into the head of Mizell on Wednesday night in the lounge of
his recording studio.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone's fishing for information," said Chris Lighty, manager
for rapper 50 Cent.</TE>
<TE>   His client, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, canceled a
Wednesday performance after receiving what police described as a
credible threat.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, police downplayed the danger to Jackson, saying they no
longer believe he is a target of Jam Master Jay's killers.</TE>

<HD>FBI Finds Own Faults in Sniper Inquiry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III said Friday that the agency has
begun a preliminary assessment of its investigation into the
Washington-area sniper shootings and already believes some of its
operations need improvement.</LD>
<LD>   Mueller stopped well short of saying he was satisfied with how
quickly police were able to solve the killings that gripped the
nation during October. But he lauded the federal, state and local
police agencies for their cooperation, which ultimately led to two
arrests in the case.</LD>
<LD>   "We wish we could have solved it earlier," Mueller said.</LD>
<TE>   Mueller said the agency is exploring ways that it can enhance the
system it uses in major investigations to collect large volumes of
tips from the public.</TE>
<TE>   But once physical evidence was obtained that linked the D.C.-area
shootings to one in Montgomery, Ala., federal agents were able to
move quickly and within hours identified a suspect from a ballistic
match and a fingerprint, Mueller added.</TE>
<TE>   In the process of investigating the shootings, the FBI has
received more than 107,000 telephone tips. That has strained the
ability of the FBI and other agencies to collect, record and sift
through the massive volume of information, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's tip system, known as Operation Rapid Start, requires
telephone operators to write out information in long hand on forms
with carbon paper. The forms are then either distributed to
investigators or typed into computers.</TE>
<TE>   "What the public doesn't understand is that we have to write every
one of these tips down and analyze them," Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the telephone calls are recorded. The problem of
unrecorded telephone tips may have robbed investigators of alleged
threats phoned in by John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo, the two
men linked to the shootings around Washington and in Alabama and
Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a local police agency may have captured Malvo or Muhammad
on tape. A recording made by the Rockville, Md., police has a male
voice telling the police operator that he is responsible for the
shootings and then giving key evidence that would identify him.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rockville telephone operator said he had reached the wrong
agency and that he needed to contact the police hotline set up by the
Montgomery County Police Department that served as the headquarters
for the joint task force investigating the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, speaking to reporters Friday at FBI headquarters in
Washington, noted that personnel to staff the phones had to be hired
locally, trained and equipped in a short amount of time.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the sniper shootings involved a complex police
organization with multiple federal, state and local agencies across
state lines and multiple command posts.</TE>
<TE>   The 107,000 tips recorded in the sniper case represent a large
response, but it still pales in comparison with the more than 300,000
tips law enforcement agencies received after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   A broad range of other evaluations about the effectiveness of FBI
and other federal agency efforts in the sniper attacks will be
undertaken in the future. A number of questions remain, including why
it took so long to link the ballistic evidence from shootings that
occurred in Louisiana and Alabama to the later shootings in the
Washington area.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Mueller said a string of international terrorist
attacks demonstrates that Al Qaeda remains a potent threat to the
United States, despite damage to its leadership, fund-raising and
communications.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller cited the recent bombings of a French tanker and a
nightclub in Bali, an attack on Marines in Kuwait, the shooting of a
U.S. diplomat in Jordan and attacks in the Philippines as
demonstrations of the still considerable threat of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, authorities linked yet another shooting to the sniper
suspects -- the wounding of a Maryland store clerk more than two
weeks before the Washington-area attacks began. The suspects are now
tied to 16 shootings, in which 12 were killed and five wounded,
around the capital and in Alabama and Louisiana.</TE>

<HD>Defense Says Trial Notes May Have Tainted Pa. Jury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Attorneys for two men convicted last month in the 1969 race-riot
slaying of a young black woman say a juror's trial notes may have
tainted other jurors' recollections of the case.</LD>
<LD>   The 11 pages of typed notes violated the spirit of the state's
rules of criminal procedure that are designed to allow jurors to form
opinions based on their own recollections, the attorneys argue.</LD>
<LD>   The notes were distributed to jury members with the judge's
approval.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorneys want to put the jurors on the stand in a bid to
overturn the Oct. 19 convictions of Robert Messersmith, 53, and
Gregory Neff, 54.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 10 white men were charged in the murder of Lillie Belle
Allen more than three decades after she was shot to death during race
riots that tore apart the city of York.</TE>
<TE>   Six pleaded guilty, former Mayor Charlie Robertson was acquitted,
and the final man has yet to go to trial. Defense attorneys hope,
through the questioning of jurors, to show that the panel that
convicted Messersmith and Neff was tainted by the opinions of the
juror who compiled the notes.</TE>

<LD>Scientists have confirmed what many mothers know: that a 1-year-old
child's absent-mindedness is replaced with robust memory recall in
the second year of life.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers said their findings add weight to the theory that
year-old toddlers are forgetful because the regions of their brains
that store and retrieve long-term memories are still forming. Other
scientists said that while the new work confirms earlier research
that toddlers' memories improve with age, it remains unclear
precisely what causes the improvements.</LD>

<HD>Newly Discovered Star Could Be Big Bang Clue</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An international team of astronomers has discovered a distant star
that could date to the beginning of the universe.</LD>
<LD>   Astronomers reported in Thursday's edition of Nature that the
giant star is a galactic rarity because it is virtually metal-free,
unlike the other, more-modern known stars. "These old stars provide
crucial clues to the star formation history and the synthesis of
chemical elements in the early universe," astronomers said. "If
totally metal-free stars could be found, this would allow the direct
study of the pristine gas from the big bang."</LD>
<LD>   The existence of stars with no or very low metal content has been
hypothesized for decades, but none has ever been found before --
throwing the theory into doubt. At the dawn of time, these stars
contained most of the elements in the universe. But quite early in
their history, these nuclear furnaces began to convert the lighter
elements into heavier ones such as carbon, phosphorous and lead.</LD>
<TE>   In theory, therefore, there were once many low- or zero-metal
stars, some of which should still exist. But they had not been found
until the discovery of this star, called HE0107-5240.</TE>

<LD>The percentage of the world's plants threatened with extinction is
much larger than commonly believed, and could be as high as 47% if
tropical species are included, researchers reported in Friday's
Science.</LD>
<LD>   The study challenges research that estimated the number of species
in danger of extinction was about 13%. Previous studies of endangered
plants underestimated the numbers because they failed to include many
plants growing in tropical countries such as Ecuador and Colombia.</LD>

<LD>The remains of four woolly rhinos found in a quarry in central
England will provide important clues about the Ice Age, scientists
said. The remains of the extinct mammals, which were found at
Whitemoor Haye in Staffordshire, are among the most complete ever
found in Britain. One had plant material in its teeth, providing
clues to its diet, said Simon Buteux, director of the field
archeology unit at the University of Birmingham.</LD>

<LD>A bacterium that thrives by feeding on a common pollutant may provide
a means to help clean up contaminated soil and ground water.</LD>
<LD>   The newly discovered microbe derives energy by degrading
trichloroethane, or TCA, a widely used industrial solvent found at
half of the contaminated U.S. Superfund sites, Michigan State
University researchers reported in Friday's Science. The microbe,
dubbed TCA1, breaks down trichloroethane to a less toxic substance,
said biologist Baolin Sun.</LD>
